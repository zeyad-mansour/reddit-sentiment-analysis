I realize these are conflicting goals.  I guess a better question is, how quickly can I bring this down without noticing it much, and how can I do that?

I was using phenibut daily for 3 years at the 800-1.2 range per day sometimes more but usually within that range. 

I've basically had to taper very quickly over the last 3 weeks due to running out and not being able to get anymore. At the time of starting the taper I had let my use get out of control and was using between 2.4 and 3 grams per day for about 2 months. 

I basically halved my dose every three days then when I got to 200 just did 200 every three days so I'm now down to 200mg every 3 days, I'm due a dose today but was just wondering if I should just drop it completely? The only thing I'm experiencing is minor tinnitus on the third day before a dose. I'm not actually feeling the 200mg either.

Been reading as much as I can and learning along the way. This caught my eye this morning. The herb is catuaba.  I'll put the link to the whole article on bottom.  It's pretty hopeful really.  Lots of scientific work being done with it for a lot of the problems we seem to have.  I'll add that too.  


""I'm stil testing it because I think this herb is interacting with the amphetamine... After two months of benzo withdrawal my cognition returned to normal... During this period my cognition, focus and mood was good but my motivation was normal... The natives recomends to mix Catuaba with Muira Puama. This last can be a good addition to **benzo withdrawal** because acts like a benzo antagonist... I guarantee this herb made me drop benzos and now is seducing me to drop amphetamines.

It does have an opioid-like mechanism, but its effects are very mild. I came across nobody reporting that it was addictive or habit-forming. Some of the anecdotal reports indicate that it could be very helpful to those trying to taper off addictive opioids or Kratom.""

Iam Polytox since i can think off, but never got on a substance to hard, and jumped just ""on time"" off the edge of Fentanyl,Oxycodon,C,Kratom,RC-Benzos,Normal Benzos,BDO,RC-Everything (just to name some) everytime, by maximum binge, and then, jump to another ""receptor"" after some weeks to a max. of ca 3 Months, so i could everytime, got off with a ""hard"" time. On this ""edge"" was also a BDO binge with no tolerance, and i think ++100ml-150 of BDO in just a couple of days/weekend. There i expierenced a full ""gaba"" rebound and withdrawal. (my first and only, except for some tavor/diazepam binge - withdrawal panicattacks etc.)

Now (before some months) i maybe i found my ""doom"" in Phenibut. it helped me so much to get out of a nearly 2 Year depressed Episode with ""no vision"" of getting better ""in time"". I could life normal without the enorumous anxiety (and it also opend my i, HOW anxies iam in my normal life and how hard it affect everything). 

&#x200B;

Iam now on it for i think, 2-3 Months, and getting rly weird after i think, just 1(?) Day without. I Think iam now on 3-7 Grams on 2-3 Times a Day, for now (2-3) Months. I rly pushed the thoughts of any withdrawal symptoms or how the dayli use will affect me, away, because i just wanted to ""live"" for some time, without the thoughts, how it will/could end (because i knowed, i cant use phenibut for much longer than months or weeks..or better shouldnt..)

&#x200B;

So maybe you guyys, can tell me, how fucked iam, and how i can help me a littl, to get off of it. (Didnt try more than a half day/day ""off"" because i alrdy scared the fuck out off me/my brain and i panicked) 

Also because of this ""panic"" atack, i took, a very high oral dose, and now, getting eyes opened, how fucked up iam, in the spot, iam right now .. :D.

Hope it is ok, to write here, my ""first thoughts"" and getting started/help maybe. I Think i cant go off of it, on christmas holidays because 150% of familly time and cant go into bad withdrawalls right now.

I already have been withdrawing from P once and I know what withdrawals feels like. It was hell but as I suffer from social anxiety and depression since I was 15 (now I'm 21) the whole withdrawal was worth the time and freedom I had from P. I didn't take P since my last withdrawal as it also lost it's magic.

Soon - in 2 weeks - I have to do a traineeship for 6 weeks and I'm already stressing the hell out of me because I know how depressed and socially anxious I'm going to be. I won't be able to be a good trainee as my cogniton, mood and drive are and will be very low. So I thought about using P again then instead of disappointing my trainee chefs and all the employees as well as the clients. I know P is something you should only take 1-2x max in a week but I don't see any other possibility as this traineeship is very important for my bachelor degree.

My idea to make the withdrawal at least a bit more manageable would be taking 3-4g (that's the initial dose that ever worked for me) in the morning and only Monday to Friday for 6 weeks. The weekends I wouldn't take any and add agmatine to hopefully reduce the tolerance and withit withdrawal issues somehow.

What do you think? Any idea or suggestion? I sure will try to not take P every day if it's possible according my mental situation but I don't see any chances in being able to do it without good old P. I already came off P once in much higher doses and longer time than 6 weeks and it was hell, yes, but manageable when being able to take some time off work and studying.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6276777}"

I’m primed with ashwaganda and NAC(today unless that’s delayed too) looking like a bumpy ride. I’ve heard stories about hospitalizations from WD and I just have to thank God that WD for me are mostly me being a grumpy man for 7-10 days. I internalize my anxiety so people don’t really catch on and I’m terrified all day, convinced my boss is going to fire me or my wife is going to leave me. 

I know it’s time more than anything but here’s what I do that seems to help:

Ashwaganda 1800mg a day
NAC (when it gets here)
Kratom 20g a day
Working out even when I feel like death
Following a ketogenic diet helps a lot 

Do you guys have any other recommendations? I’m ready to stop this, I can’t keep going through life like Adam Sandler in click when he’s in auto pilot mode. My family deserves much more from me.

Before I quit, my doctor prescribed me 50 mg trazodone to help me sleep at night. It works, but makes me feel groggy and exhausted the next morning. It might be because it’s an antidepressant, and I already take Prozac. It also makes me experience symptoms of dehydration. I usually cut the tablets in half otherwise I also get really bad restless legs when I try to sleep.

The first day phenibut free wasn’t bad, probably because I was feeling the phenibut’s effects from the day before. The second day was when I started feeling withdrawals. They weren’t unbearable, but I became more jumpy, and I couldn’t recall having any rem sleep that night. On the 3rd night, the withdrawals were noticeably worse. I was tired, jumpy, unmotivated, felt some bad headaches, and didn’t get any rem sleep that night either. On the 4th day, despite not sleeping well, I felt a lot better. I was acting silly and having fun, though I had less of a filter from the lack of sleep. That night, I realized that I hadn’t taken my Prozac the past few nights, and considered that it was contributing to my lack of sleep. After taking both antidepressants, I got very tired and slept pretty well. The next day I felt much better. I ate more, went to the gym, which helped me feel more normal. I was in a pretty good mood. Last night though, I didn’t sleep that well. I went to sleep later than I should have and only slept 5 hours.

Not sure what to expect or do here.","**tl;dr since I'm a chronic rambler: I got off phenibut for a month with baclofen. Before my baclofen taper was finished, I relapsed for two weeks. Wondering how bad the rebound is gonna be and what my best approach to dealing with it is. I have no baclofen, but I have 90 1mg etizolam tablets and a propranolol prescription.**

So, I had managed to get off phen for about a month using baclofen. An unfortunate series of events ended in a 2 week relapse. 

Basically, the place I buy etizolam from decided to shut down for a few days. As far as I know, there are no other etizolam vendors who do 2 day domestic shipping, so I has no other options but to just stretch my etizolam supply razor thin. When I had to go 2 days entirely etizolam-free, I made the terrible decision of using phenibut to deal with it. Those 2 days, I took 2g of phen along with my 40mg of baclofen, and it worked fine for getting through the etizolam ""withdrawal"" (I was only taking 1-2mg per day, so it wasn't like it was gonna be this massive thing either way). 

Well, after having spent nearly a year with phenibut causing nothing but internal tremors and anxiety, I noticed that, after having quit for a month, phenibut now worked like it used to. I decided to try taking my old 7g dose ""just for a day"" to see how it felt, and it was the fantastic euphoria I had known and loved for years before. 

The timing of this ended up being pretty much as bad as it possibly could've been. Unbeknownst to me, I had about 2 weeks straight of work without a single day off ahead of me. Bear in mind, I've been working part time at around 20-25 hours a week for years, and with no warning (much less being asked) I was dogpiled with more hours than I had ever worked with no breaks. I very deliberately keep my work/life balance relaxed because I'm extremely prone to stress. The unexpected onslaught of work ended up causing me to start using phenibut daily as a coping mechanism. 

I can tell some tolerance is already building. The first 5 or 6 days, it was that classic manic, ""everything is amazing"" phenibut euphoria. Now, on day 12, I can definitely still feel some of that phenibut magic, but it's nowhere near what it was before. If the first five days or so were amazing, now it's just ""pretty good"". The effects don't feel anywhere near what they were before. Honestly, what pisses me off the most is the fact that I relapsed and didn't even get to enjoy it. It was just a coping mechanism, and all the days where I had the full effects where spent slaving away at a fucking dollar store.

So here I am, 2 weeks later, having used phenibut every day the entire time. Before the relapse, I was still taking 40mg/day of baclofen, I wasn't fully finished tapering on that front, either. I got my baclofen from an overseas website, but I didn't order as much as I should've, which caused me to run out before my baclofen taper was finished. I ordered more a while ago, but it's been around a month, but I don't think it's coming. The DHL tracking link is broken (it was from the beginning), which I initially assumed was just an error with DHL, but given the amount of time it's been, I'm guessing the package either got lost somehow or never shipped in the first place.

So now, I'm wondering what I should expect, and what I should do next. I have around 90 1mg etizolam tablets, memantine, and a propranolol prescription in my arsenal. I ordered some NAC as well that should be arriving Saturday. I have gabapentin, too, but I've been taking that daily for nearly a year, so I don't think it's gonna help me out much. 

What should I expect, and what's my best course of action here? I've heard from several people on here that acute phenibut withdrawal only lasts around a week, so what I'm thinking is I'll try and just tough it out with the etizolam and propranolol. 

My concern is the fact that I wasn't fully finished with my baclofen taper when I relapsed. Is that gonna make things worse? If I had a two week relapse without having been on baclofen, I imagine this wouldn't be a huge problem at all, but I'm afraid the fact that I had been taking baclofen is gonna make things worse.

So currently, I’m on kratom, phenibut and excedrin pills (APAP, aspirin and caffeine) 

I take a total of 24-27 grams of kratom a day
3-4 grams of phenibut a day
1,040 mg of caffeine a day from the excedrin pills. 

I take 3.5 grams of kratom as soon as I wake up (7 AM) along with .8 mg of phenibut and two excedrin pills (130 mg caffeine) 

I dose 3.5 grams of kratom in two hour intervals, as well as 2 excedrin pills with each dose (130 mg caffeine) , every two hours until I go to bed. 

At 2 or 3 PM , I do my regular kratom and excedrin dose with 1 gram of phenibut. 

At 8 PM, I do my regular dose with 1.2-1.4 grams of phenibut. 

11 PM I take my final dose of kratom with 1 excedrin & no phenibut. 

This has been routine everyday for the past two years , I started the excedrin pills a year ago because it synergies very well with kratom and phenibut but now all it does is give me a little boost for 30 minutes then I begin feeling so fatigued. 
Not to mention it gives me headaches every other day no matter how much water I drink. 

I’m so tired almost all day. And I’m not doing my kidneys any favors with the Aspirin and APAP in the excedrin.

If I can help it , I would like to stay on the kratom but maybe lower the dosage because I suffer from chronic pain and it’s really been the only thing helping me, although I’m sure it contributes to the fatigue I feel everyday.

I don’t even know where or how to start tapering off of everything. But I know I need to quit, it’s not sustainable and it’s a huge financial burden. 


I would like to start off very slowly, as I have to stay functional for my job and I’m a single father who never has a moment to relax until bed time. Any help or input would be appreciated , I apologize for the wall of text.

I decided to calculate how many days ago I bought my phenibut, and how much I have left, and now I'm nervous.

After looking things up on reddit due to curiosity, I'm horrified seeing peoples stories. Especially the ones where people say they didn't sleep for many days and wanted to die after taking phenibut at a low dose for just a few weeks.
I never even got that noticable of a feeling at all, aside from yesterday and the few other occasions I took a 1.5g dose. 

I notice the more I'm expecting something to be unbearable, the more likely the thing will be absolutely unbearable. I'm afraid I'm doing myself dirty reading people's ""phenibut hell"" stories, I'm not sure how to feel. I hope I'm not at the point where it's just an unbelievably shitty hell. Maybe I'll just keep busy and avoid dwelling on it to the best of my ability, I don't want to psych myself out and make things much more difficult then needed.

I knew getting into phenibut it might be a problem but I had no idea how bad it was going to get. Now to the part where I need some fucking serious help.

I am currently taking anywhere from 7-9 gpd.

But phenibut is sounding like it’s going to be probably the worst I’ve yet to try to kick. 

I am going to my psychologist on the 22nd this month and have already given him a heads up so he can do his research on phenibut, and have suggested the baclofen/gabapentin taper.. But my question is, is how bad do you all think this is going to be, and how long of a process is this going to be?

I haven’t been taking hardly any of my 2mg klonopin so I have 100+ saved, I have 100+ suboxone saved as well, I just am waiting on the baclofen/gabapentin.. I work 6 days a week right now for UPS but I’m only seasonal so my job ends Jan 15th at latest. Do I start my taper now while working 8-12 hour days 6 days a week, or do I wait 5 weeks to start?

I had been saving my gabapentin script for when I went cold turkey, which I did once I got to 1gpd.

Anyways. Today was the first time I saw a dentist since I started taking it. When I took phenibut HCL crystals I would just scoop it in my tongue, let it dissolve then swallow. I hardly ever brushed my teeth or rinsed out afterwards. While at the dentist, they told me I had no enamel whatsoever on the back of my teeth. Enamel protects against cavities and once it's gone, it's gone. The acidity has also caused my bottom and top teeth to appear chipped because they are being slowly burned. Most embarrassing of all, the dentist said my teeth are similar to that of someone with bulimia because only the back enamel is gone.


My teeth aren't bad and I normally take good care of them. It's pretty sad that I have no more enamel...it will surely cost a lot to repair each tool with fillings down the line. Somewhat NSFW pic here: https://imgur(dot)com/a/F6kJk3r (I didn't want it to appear automatically for mobile users)

I found out about Kratom because I was looking for a natural pain reliever and I use to buy 7/11 brand caffeine pills and also came across sleep walker. So for at least half a year I was taking it not knowing. I use to drink like 2 Red Bull’s and a redline a day because I was a caffeine junkie but when I started taking these I didn’t even need a cup of coffee anymore. My GM at work was into nootropics also so I gave him some in a plastic ramekin and they had literally dissolved a month later because he hadn’t taken them 🤔 so I tried using Kratom to get off off the pills then found myself going back and forth. I talked to a psychiatrist and she told me to take lunesta and she knew nothing about phenubit but said to stop taking all of my supplements except SAMe. I didn’t have much confidence in her diagnosis because she diagnosed me with insomnia. Soooooo I just kept taking the limitless that was 2 months ago. So I reached out to another psychiatrist that was familiar with phenubit and prescribed me lexapro and I told her I have klonopin also she asked how much I was taking and I told her 1 mg  and she told me to taper off of that for 3 days because it can be dependent but I was on day 2 of cold turkey at work yesterday and had to leave early because I’m a server and I was of no use to anyone I’m off of work for 4 days and hoping I can at least see some form of result with taking the lexapro and the detox stage. I felt like such and idiot to fall into a trap like that like I did with Kratom, it’s always a trap 10 years ago I was hooked on opiates for a good 3 years because they were being prescribed to me for pain and when they took me off of them I found them elsewhere so when I got clean I tried to do everything natural with supplements also as a placebo for myself because I was taking pills everyday  I’m curious to what this struggle will be. I stopped taking phenubit a few weeks ago and Kratom which I took responsibly helped but I just don’t want anything I wasn’t to get back to my old self which was not much of a difference of who I was when I was on the phenubit just enhanced me",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5090294}"

So awhile ago I made a post saying I was finally done with my taper and would make a longer post about my experience later! So here it is.

My story with phenibut started in august. I had just quit a 4 month habit of kratom cold turkey after being on and off of it for almost 3 years. The kratom turned on me and I honestly felt better during the acute phase of that withdrawal than I did while on it. 

It had been about a month and I was still experiencing very strong after effects from the kratom withdrawal. One of them being random hours of extreme shaking and the most horrific panic attacks. Before this withdrawal I had never had panic attacks in my life so I wasent coping too well and life honestly felt like a sinister nightmare.

I had an important place to be on august 8th and was terrified of having a panic attack or ruining people’s impression of me so I went to my local smokeshop and bought the only thing I could think of that would help, a sleepwalker shot. 

I took it on that day and it was EXTREMELY potent and very euphoric and I had no anxiety at all, slept like a baby. The following days after I rationalized continuing to take phenibut because it was so great and I was scared of the rebound and going back to how I felt before....

Fast forward 2 weeks of 1.5g daily use and the smokeshops near me were running out of the sleepwalker shots that still contained phenibut but instead of taking it as a sign and just quitting I was too scared and continued seeking it out driving to another town to find it. I knew they would run out too so I placed an order on ND.

My use over about a 3 week period went from 1.5g a day to 3g a day. When my order arrived I started taking 4 grams a day but the phenibut was starting to not work as well and show its side effects. My once extremely high libido crashed, I wasent eating enough, and I was starting to feel anhedonic even while being on the phenibut. 

So after around a month on September 5th and after rapidly increasing doses, and chronic sleep deprivation that was beginning to cloud my judgement i decided to find some kind of stimulant and take it with the phenibut. 

It felt great but in my hazy judgement I took a bit too much phenibut and started going into a brownout I ended up taking 10 grams of phenibut that day and not eating anything at all.

That night the stims wore off and I went into what must’ve been a slight overdose. I was nodding off like I was on heroin, drooling on myself and couldn’t even form a sentence. I was extremely tired but couldn’t sleep. I was a zombie basically, the worst state I’ve ever been in in my life. 

That lasted till 6pm the next day and then suddenly I snapped out of it. I immediately planned a taper out and cut my dose by 5 grams to 3g a day. The phenibut actively made me feel worse at this point and I was getting scared I caused “receptor death” or brain damage...

But on the third night of being on 3g I had gotten maybe 2 hours of sleep in 3 days and the insane rebound plus lack of sleep was causing me to audibly hallucinate and I was really scared I was going to go crazy or something. But somehow that night at some point I just shut down and finally got around 4 hours of sleep. 

I had the most terrifying delirious nightmares you could imagine but after waking up felt much better and clear headed. I had stabilized finally. 

At that point I just dropped around 200mg every three days until I got to .7 where I dropped 100mg every 3 days then at .4 50mg every three days, and finally when I got to 50mg I sat at that for 2 weeks and then jumped off. 

It’s been awhile now maybe almost a month since I jumped and I feel the best I have in a long time. Much better than when I was taking kratom or after I quit that. 

During my taper I used agmatine, ashwagwanda and magnesium to help. The biggest tip I can give is to take your dose or doses at the same time every single day that helped me feel the most stable. 

I honestly can’t believe that I ever did any of what I just wrote but it’s over now and I’m more than happy to move on and have a normal life now. Thank you to absolutely everyone that helped and I wish everyone the best in getting off of this terrible, dirty drug.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43676457}"

I don't have any self-control right now but fear is keeping me basically in line and sort of focussed.    


I already bought NAC and magnesium glycerinate.  I have green tea.  L-theanine makes me fucking edgy.  No idea why.  But I also have multi-vitamins and zinc and some other vitamin type stuff.  I tried all kinds of this over the years to manage my anxiety.  Too bad phenibut worked so good until it turned on me.  


What do you guys think about this? I've never heard taurine, B6 or omegas mentioned.  Should I get those, too? I need to feel as ready as I can because I'm having a hard time staying on the taper already.  Every day I think 'well one more day of high doses and I'll cut tomorrow'.  


Tomorrow exists, no? I hope it shows up here real soon.  This is the text I meant.  


### GABA Deficiency

If GABA levels fall too low, then there is not enough inhibition to keep glutamate in check. Like a car without brake fluid, you may have lost the ability to slow things down. To remedy this imbalance, you can either find ways to reduce the effects of glutamate, enhance the activity of GABA, or both. Many of the measures we’ll discuss support both.

The balancing supplements for glutamate and GABA include the amino acids [taurine](https://www.naturalmentalhealth.com/blog/taurine-supplements-anxiety), [GABA](https://www.naturalmentalhealth.com/blog/gaba-supplements-anxiety), and [l-theanine](https://www.naturalmentalhealth.com/blog/l-theanine-benefits-anxiety); the anti-oxidants [NAC](https://www.naturalmentalhealth.com/blog/nac-supplements-anxiety) and green tea; vitamins B6 and D; the minerals magnesium and zinc; omega-3 fatty acids; and several herbal therapies.\* These supplements will be described in detail in the later parts of this series.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63060486}"

Something I also find really weird is that I will go on binges some weekends where i take heaps of kratom,pheni, and alc and wake up feeling completely fine with no hangovers. Maybe the fact that im a fairly big dude contributes to how my body handles these substances, despite no hangovers, recently i have noticed some slight aches in my back kidney area, a weird ache in my bladder, and VERY toxic smelling urine which makes me worry for my kidney/liver health.

It was so painful, with splits in my fingertips that bled and couldn't be soothed as my fingers just got bigger and bigger.

I was put on baclofen and when my fingers and gut also began to swell, I quit that CT as well.

I've been on daily phenibut for about 22 months, taking small doses every 4-6 he's sure my the day. I have gone up and down as tolerance demands and taking agmatine really has always helped.

I never had issues with swollen hands and fingers with phenibut before. But when I quit Lyrica and Topamax, I also CT phenibut. I did this until the withdrawal reminded me to taper it, so I reinstated phenibut a little. And agmatine.

Lately my fingers are swollen as sausages and splitting and the only thing I know of to give me such a reaction is a GABApentanoid.

I have been tapering off my clonazepam. Otherwise I do t take anything else GABAergic.

My doses of phenibut lately have been all over the place. Some days total 6-8g in scattered doses while other days may be 3.5g. When it wears off I notice that my mucous membranes seem like they have much more mucous and are just yucky. I need nasal spray to sleep or breathe. I am sensitive to smells and chemicals.

I have been trying to tie down the source of swelling by skipping doses of phenibut but it seems the swelling happens as a symptom of withdrawal and then if I use pheni it again, I also swell more.

My skin is dry all the time esp my hands so now despite all this moisturizer, my skin cracks and bleeds now from stretching and then contracting.

In all of this, I have no sources to link phenibut to this but I have found a scattered post or two online from others that sound similar.

I was hoping to use baclofen to ease off phenibut as my supply of phenibut dwindled (always ""this is the last tub"") but then the swelling scared me off baclofen. I thought everything would go back to it has been but now there is no other culprit than phenibut.

Does agmatine make it worse? Is it kindling? Am I throttling myself?

How could I stabilize and quit? I know just skipping doses and going CT for a day or two and then going back is causing issues like maybe kindling? Are these rebound effects? A vicious cycle?

And why after almost 2 years without any swelling of hands or feet would lead me to having this happen now?

I've taken all these GABApentanoids and topamax before individually and never had any side effects. But now that I have used them prescribed and used together, I seem to have been pointed downhill with no way back up.

Am I now super sensitive or becoming allergic to VGCC in some way?

So confused... I have all the baclofen and lyrica still and am sure baclofen is what most ppl use to get off phenibut. Would it be better to go back to trying baclofen but rather than as my rx medication but instead as a replacement to taper off phenibut for good? And what about agmatine?

**Quick Overview:**
3gpd to cold turkey 6 days ago using only clonidine and gabapentin. I would not recommend it. I stopped taking gabapentin 2 days ago. On gabapentin I actually slept fine, supplemented with 100mg of trazodone, but last night and the night before, the first days without those few grains masquerading as GABA, were an absolute shit show. I’ve had insomnia before but it has never been this resistant to sedatives. I typically take 50mg of trazodone per night and get a glorious 7-8 uninterrupted hours. 

**My Palliative:**
I took 150mg of trazodone, 10mg of melatonin, pill after pill of valerian, god knows how much kava, multiple propranolol, and drank herbal tea like it was going out of style. 150mg of trazodone would usually put me out so rapidly I’d wake up with my phone on my face and a hangover that wouldn’t part till noon.

**My Experience:**
I barely slept a wink. It’s 6:30AM and I feel strung out on coffee. The best way to describe my sleep would be persistently interrupted. Not interrupted hourly, no, more like trying to sleep as a fire alarm screams through your house. You are always on the surface of sleep, like lying naked on the peak of a windy hill with nothing but a thin sheet; you hopelessly advise yourself that you’re warm as never ending gusts creep chilled air through your defenses and send a tiresome, tiresome tingling throughout your body till sunrise. You are charged up, heart beating and beating, and have such a frustration that something so natural resists your best known strategies.


With an already positive outlook and supplemental help from kava, propranolol, and l-theanine, my anxiety has been next to nowhere. This is just an altogether unique kind of insomnia. I’ve experienced insomnia in my earlier years, hence the nightly trazodone usage. I would greatly appreciate further advise if anyone has any. I would prefer keeping it to over-the-counter supplements. I feel at this point the only other thing I can do is give it time.


**PS:**
Yesterday I got a multivitamin and felt undeniably better after taking it. It’s impossible to say what specifically helped but it’s definitely worth mentioning. If you aren’t taking one and are struggling, consider adding it to your toolkit. Be sure to eat something beforehand and drink plenty of water with it as they give some people a nasty stomach ache otherwise.

Now I don’t smoke weed anymore because it tends to make me anxious but the thing I noticed about Delta 8 is that it gives you all the positive attributes of cannabis without the paranoia or anxiety. The amazing thing was for the first time in months it felt like my brain and body reset in a way. I slept great, my appetite was back and the whole next day I had a calm that stayed with me and I even forgot to dose my phenibut at the normal time (something I would never do normally)   This was different than smoking weed. This felt therapeutic. 
Since my discovery I’ve tapered even faster than before and I’m at 4.5gpd all the way from 10+gpd a few months back   Same old story: I used recreationally for years was a weekend warrior and when a stressful period in my life came I found that 500mg a day took the edge off....until it didn’t work anymore and I upped it to a 1g. This went on and on until I was ordering 200 grams at a time from Liftmode and swallowing 8,9,10 grams of powder a day. I eventually decided my health could not endure this never ending cycle and I began to taper. Fast forward 2 months and here we are. 
This is giving me my life back. I’m not depressed, I’m sleeping and eating like I should, my social anxiety is basically gone.  I supplement my phenibut with Agmatine and Baclofen and Gabapentin.

I saw it coming and being prescribed 30 10mg Baclofen each month for lower back spasms I saved them up for a few months. I had some gabapentin left over for neuropathy attributed to fibromyalgia (or phenibut, who knows) and I worked it in between a total of 40-50mg Baclofen daily. Valerian root and Melatonin worked wonders as well. I know my dose wasn't as large as some stories claim but I still experienced very undesirable side effects, the worst for me was high blood pressure, a persistent restlessness and agitation. However I did begin to have pain in my left arm yesterday, similar to what my fibromyalgia feels like but that coupled with the high bp I went to the ER, everything turned out fine, all labs, EKG, but possible left arterial enlargement, which may have already been there. I think I am on the other side of the mountain, last night my blood pressure was pretty good after all that at the ER. No doubt much is exacerbated by my GAD.

I take it mostly for social anxiety because being around so many people at work makes me nervous for some reason. 

I decided to just stop taking it and start using Fasoracetam, L-theanine, and Emoxypine. I know you all are going to say that your crazy and you gotta taper but let me tell you I haven't had any WD after taking this stack daily and I'm on day 6 of taking a break from it.. I'm not nessecarily quiting Phenibut but I'm going to start using it more responsibility, like on days where my social anxiety is really bad and at most 3 times a week. Plus I'm not going to use more than 1g at a time. 

L-Theanine converts glutamate into GABA, which is perfect for Phenibut withdrawal, let me tell you it works. I take it before work and right before bed and it totally relaxes me. Along with Emoxypine and Fasoracetame its a god send. Emoxypine is great for repairing your brain neurons after heavy use of substances and Fasoracetam unregulates GABAb so they are all just synergistic in a way that I couldn't imagine. 

I highly recommend this for WD but like everything else it could work for me but not for you. Either way atleast I know got something that works. Another thing that works is that I don't let fear play a role when coming off of Phenibut. I believe fear plays a big role when coming off Phenibut so I try not to let it get in the way. 

Hope this helps someone out and please don't just take my advice and quit cold turkey. Some people react differently when coming off of this stuff so please use a taper if you can.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.61470044}"

So my daily in take was 3.2g 1g taken 3x a day plus the extra 200mg at bed.

So immediately I substituted 500mg of Phenibut with Baclofen with each dose. So now it looked like 500mg of Phenibut and 5mg Baclofen with each three doses.

I did that for one week and I have to admit, that was pretty easy. Didn’t really phase me to tell the truth.

But then when I tried to drop 500mg off my current dose it was like I felt it IMMEDIATELY. By my next dose, I couldn’t sleep, I was irritable and the whole 9 yards. Baclofen helps but it definitely doesn’t with sleep. I have 100mg trazodones I’ll have to start using.

So then I realized this is Christmas, and I don’t want to be like this through the whole Christmas holidays (plus I’m a server and this is the busiest time of year.. and yeah.. try serving withdrawing off of Phenibut to a load of grinches)

So I stabilized back out at 700mg 3x a day. So I dropped significantly in one week. And I could just stop taking the Baclofen no problem so I have hopes for when I continue.

Before I start using my Baclofen I’m going to keep tapering just using Phenibut so I can get as much knocked out as I can. 

I’m going to try 600mg 3x a day today.

So if you had Baclofen and you were taking 700mg 3x a day, what would your Phenibut/Baclofen schedule look like?

So, I have been off phenibut for around 2 1/2 weeks. During my taper I had what I guess can be described as as a mental break and spent a week in the hospital. During that time I was experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions, losing time, panic attacks and I broke my leg somehow.

While I was in the hospital they started giving me baclofen 4x a times a day. Now, i've tapered down to 10mg 2x a day, and I feel...really gross. It's nothing even remotely close to how I was feeling before. But, I feel miserable. Like how I imagine you feel when near a dementor in harry potter, just completely devoid of happiness.

Surgery went well, I have 5 screws in my ankle and have a nerve block right now. So, ill start feeling it tommorow.

I've read on the phenibut wiki that s-phenibut doesn't do anything for GABAb but it does work on the gabapentin receptors  as strong as r-phenibut, and I've read that gabapentin can make you twice as suicidical and I've really never been depressed and just seeing a bleak future as I am now.  Last week they send me a small sample of phenibut from another vendor and it is much stronger like the real phenibut.

So I guess the vendor used to have a normal racemix mix but the recent months it's been really shit. idk if it's because some distributor mixed pure racemic with inactive shit, or if it's a bunk batch with more s-phenibut than r-phenibut.

I called PayPal 3 times and they weren't helpfull atall, they told me I had £76 I  my account before but that also doeant make sense as then I'd have £106. I then went back and looked at the transactions and there were 30 transactions listed yet I had sold 40 on Ebay. I googled and apparently PayPal does fuck alot of people out of money, so I feel that could be real. Then it started happening with my bank account. After the PayPal thing I started transferring all my money into my bank account straight away. I had £34 in my account and then another £30 went in and then I had £39  when I should have had £64 i looked at the transactions tion history and all the old transactions that made up the £34 had vanished. I mean, is this possible to do as a scammer? There is no trace so that's why i wonder if I'm going psychotic. I tried wlexplaing to the bank but it's hard to when there is no physical proof of fraud. I feel like I'm down £60 AND sending stuff away free. I'm just questioning it all because I have been experiencing some haullinations and real memory issues.

Advice?,"Hey all, I know there's like a million posts on this subject but I am hoping beyond hope that I can get my doctor to give me baclofen or gabapentin or both, I'm printing out info and even a scientific case study on phenibut that suggests the tapering method...if/when I get it, what is a good tapering method from 8gpd of phenibut, been using 2-3 grams for years then recently got myself up to 8 somehow...I take 4 2g doses throughout the day...how should I taper the phenix, add in the baclofen etc? 

Thanks!!",1,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.66294503}"

I have kept my vitimins high along with minerals. I drink lots of water and only eat meat once a day. I take a choline source as well. I am planning on dropping to 1g tomorrow, then 500mg the next day. then 250mg the next day. then 250mg for two more days. Then stop. I am an experienced drug user unfortunately. I have been clean from cocaine, xanax, and heroine for about a year now. I now only take modafinil. Adderall. Phenibut. Choline. And smoke some weed every night. Do you guys think using Noopept, weed, and 5-htp will help me have a smooth transition? sorry for the odd post. thank you. goodnight.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5406907}"
