Doses as high as 10 grams and weened myself down to 1.5 grams and switched to baclofen. Unfortunately I never weened myself off that baclofen and when I ran out went right back to the phenibut. I’ve talked to my boss at work about my addiction. So I’m going to take a weeks paid vacation that I’m owed and then she said I have up to 10 days worth of sick days I’m top of that as long as I have a doctors approval. I’m on around 6 grams right now and I want to ween myself down to at least 2 before I go to this detox. What I’m really wondering is will they even know what the heck phenibut is? I can bring case studies and stuff like that but I’m worried they won’t take it as serious as it is. Any helpful input would be appreciated guys.

So do you think these horror stories are dramatic and worded so dramatically because people are in anxiety when they write it except for the people taking ungodly amounts for years?...i guess what i want in this is people to post their expierence looking back and realized it wasnt that bad they were just panicking and made it sound horribly worse because they were in a panic when they posted on here? Or can it really be more sinister for us first timers reading this stuff freaking out about these stories? I understand this stuff at high doses for a long time will really screw you up and we should really stay away but i worry like me people read the stories of those people and freak making us take more and digging ouselves deeper...so how about some people who cruised away from this stuff? Or does everyone have a mental breakdown? Even if it does cause depression and anxiety can we hear some descriptions from people on the other side who can give people who are rebounding and panicking searching for answers hope?

The liquid shots were placed in gas stations and stores, ranging from large chains (Racetrac, Murphy USA) to privately owned convenience stores, along side 5 Hour Energy and other reputable brands. Sleep Walker works magnitudes better than competitors because it contains an addictive, psychotropic chemical. Unwilling people were duped into addiction if they unknowingly consumed two or more of these a day for an extended time period. If you work a demanding job or have lots of varying priorities, and find something that works and helps, you cannot blame a customer for continuing to use the product.

Then, the real kicker, these assholes receive a letter from the FDA telling them to quit using the one addictive chemical. They remove and replace it without a peep. As you could imagine, there are probably thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of people at a total loss as to why they are suddenly so anxious and depressed. This is beyond fucked up. I happen to be one of those people. After some research, I feel better. I’m not going through an unexplained psychological meltdown because of no reason. It’s basically forced withdrawals.

2020-06-27 20:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/hh4otp/weirdness_happening_at_35ishg/,Weirdness happening at 3.5(ish)g,"So I'll just cut to the point with this one.

Going from 9.5g to 3.5g was amazingly easy for me. I tapered anywhere from 200 to 350mg per day, with close to 0 side effects. Mostly just insomnia, nothing a little seroquel couldn't fix.

Everything changed once I hit 3.5g, and it's gotten... weird.

If you're a regular here, you may have seen my last post about how I had a seizure when I went from 3.3 to 3.0. I'm not actually certain I had a seizure, as no one was around to confirm or deny, but my tongue had a nice little bite in it, and my face had a bruise, so I'm 90% sure that's what happened. What I **can** verify is that I went into a sort of fugue state that night as well. According to my dad, I came out of room stumbling and slurring my words. He thought I had been drinking (I had nothing else that night other than my normal maintenance doses of phenibut and kratom). He told me that I said I needed baclofen. When he told me he didn't have any (which, in a clear state of mind, I obviously would've already known) he said I asked him to take me to the ER. It was really late and he didn't want to go, but apparently I really pressed him to. 

I barely remember any of this happening. Really, the only thing I remember was when we were about to leave, but it's a very faint memory. The first thing I clearly remember was us driving home, after I apparently told him that I didn't need to go anymore (I probably just felt guilty for making him go in the middle of the night). 

After that, I took 3.5g for a couple nights, then started trying to cut back just 100mg/day.

Cut to last night. I had taken 3.4g the day before, was gonna cut to 3.3. I started to notice myself getting pretty anxious. At first, I didn't think too much of it, as I had been pretty anxious in general the past couple days. It started to get worse and worse, until, eventually, my heart was pounding out of my chest and the anxiety bordered on terror. As if that wasn't bad enough, I started to notice the early warning signs of psychosis, seeing stuff out of the corners of my eye, seeing weird little ""hairs"" and ""bugs"" (I dunno if anyone know what I'm talking about with those, but every time I've gotten drug induced psychosis, those have been the first warning sign). I was absolutely mortified. It was very clearly phenibut withdrawal, and a pretty bad one at that, but... I BARELY reduced my dose. I feel like there should be no way that I got that bad of a withdrawal from a single 100mg drop. Nonetheless, I freaked out and ended up taking extra, making it a total of 4g yesterday. I also took 20mg of ambien and 2mg of lorazepam to calm myself down and knock myself out.

Things got even weirder this morning. I woke up in the most clear-headed, lucid state of mind I have been in in MONTHS. I honestly didn't even realize how bad the brainfog was from phenibut until it all went away out of nowhere this morning. I don't know exactly how to describe it, but it was like everything felt ""real"" and normal again, like this entire phenibut addiction thing was just some crazy nightmare. On top of that, I had ZERO glutamate surge symptoms. This is the first time the glutamate surges have fully stopped since I started getting them months ago.

So I felt absolutely fantastic for a couple hours. At some point while I was working, the glutamate surges came back (hard to say exactly when, as I usually don't notice them while I'm working).

Does anyone have any ideas as to what exactly is happening here? I'm honestly just so confused. I'm also quite worried, because it's really difficult to call in sick or leave early from my job because most weeknights, they only schedule 2 people to work, and company policy is that no one can be alone in the store. If I start going into a crazy withdrawal like that again right before or during a shift, I have no idea what I'd do. This chemical is seriously unreal.

ETA: Possible theory... Does phenibut degrade over time with light/moisture? The phenibut I'm using has been sitting in an open container for a decent while, I think a couple months.

Also to add, I'm starting to feel a bit anxious again. I really hope this doesn't end up like last night. Gonna take a bunch of gabapentin and pray for the best.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48263815}"

It wasnt terrible but I felt completely soulless all day. Had my dad watch the kid for a couple days, I played Disgaea 5 most of the day.

I have a Ritalin prescription. I was kind of thinking of taking a break from it these two weeks but not sure if that will just make me more depressed. Dort of felt like that yesterday.

Tried baclofen for the last 3 weeks, up to 50mg daily and its not helping at all. Does anyone know what dose I should be using?

Would gabapentin work better?

Thanks guys and girls

I started taking it a month ago, and took it 2-5 days a week (Usually 2-3) at doses of 750mg to 2g (I know this is too much and I've already started keeping doses below 1g) during these days, with the doses above 1g split between two times during the day.

I already have some anxiety, specifically socially which is the reason why I started taking it. The last week my anxiety when I'm off of it has increased significantly and has made it extra difficult to function socially.

The problem is that I have important social situations several times per week in the near future, and where I would normally be able to deal with them w/o phenibut, I feel as though my anxiety off of it is unpredictable enough that I may struggle.

I want to return to a place where I can do fine without it, and be able to use it on occasion to help me without the side effects.

Been abusing phenibut for about 7 months off and on, never withdrew (even put it down for a couple weeks w/o issue after daily use  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ) could go three days w/o a problem but at a certain point I would just dose every other day simply out of fear of withdrawal... I take stupid to whole new levels folks. 

Just over two weeks ago I noticed I felt even more depressed than normal (it's been a hellish year and I attempted suicide once.) After feeling low w/o apparent explanation the panic set in... like, not just a typical panic attack, more like primal fear, horrifying... I couldn't figure it out and then \*lightbulb\* the phenibut turned on me! So I played with my dose which has been alllllll over the place to try and stabilize and then taper down with the baclofen I have on hand, and it was hard... a couple nights I even increased my dose, but low and behold, the panic didn't change, sometimes got even worse! And then saturday I got some Kava I had ordered, 15 min. after dosing I felt 95% better... so the last three days I've cut my phen dose in half, with no negatives to speak of. Now, if I was truly in phen withdrawal, kava might have helped, but it wouldn't have reversed my symptoms, right?

He said something along the lines of being tolerant to gaba but still getting a dopamine boost. This hit home for me since I have a very hight tolerance for gaba drugs and a very low stim tolerance.

I thought its just a anxiolytic GABAergic substance, definitely a gabapentionoid.**

Did some research. I'm not a doctor, so I might be mistaken.

It has a ""mild"" dopamine stimulatory effects. (not mild anymore at dosages 500mg+).

They treat with it for ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYNDROMES, like seizures, delirium and others with high doses over 1.5g a day, but also for alcohol withdrawal & ADHD doses around 100-300mg.

**COLD-TURKEY HIGH DAILY DOSAGE HAS A POSSITIBITY OF LETHAL OUTCOME**

**MY ADVICE for ""Bingers""**: Try to toper down to the lowest torelable dose, e.g 4gpd to 1gpd in no longer than 7 days after 2-3 weeks of use. Now it's time to Cold-Turkey from phenibut using alternative anti-seizure med (to avoid the most scary and lethal withdrawal symptom).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**SOME NOTES IVE MADE BASED ON RESEARCH!!!**

**In USA** detox from phenibut works usualy same way: Tappering down using GABAPentin or BacloFen, sometimes with an addition of Lorazepam or some other ""lore med"" which is pretty bad itself.

**In Central Europe**, our lovely diazepam is an art when it comes to anti-seizure meds. So doctors switch you to Valium(diazepam) and for those people who're over-active cuz of phenibut dopaminergic effects and dopaminergic hyper activity long after cessation like alcoholics)  need psychotics, for example  really mild one, ***Tiapride***. *Two diffrent approches, both seems to work just fine seems so?*

&#x200B;

In general the drug acts also by boosting your dopamine levels to the somewhat level of ""Speed/Adderal(american)"" high; exactly the opposite of what ADHD users would get from it - calmness. Phenibut is a structurally similiar substance to the naturally ocuring in animals most crucial neurotransmitter GABA. So recreational users not only tend to get SPEED effect, but also super calmness like using any other benzo/GABAergic drug. For ADHD it sounds like a wonder medication. Short-term its acting as calm medicine, long term it's working as a GABAergic so if a ADHD patient skips a dose and becomes overactive, the long-acting GABA boost is there (GABA & Glutamate has to be in **HOMEOSTASIS**) so GABA will counter eventually some Glutamate overactivity anyway.

*The unique pharmacological set of Phenibut makes its tempting for drug abusers, because you get awesome relaxating effects, yet you still feel completely ""sober"" cuz of the dopamine stimulation*

&#x200B;

**MY ADVICE**: Try to toper down to the lowest torelable dose, e.g 10gpd to to the lowest tolerable dose that you feel like u can handle. Now it's time to Cold-Turkey from phenibut using VALIUM(or other strong benzo)/**BACLOFEN/GABAPENTIN** drug, based on your posibilities. From this point on u can tapper of these meds much easily, without any stimulatory effects.

I am a poly drug addict who has been clean off of pharma/street drugs for about ten years. Recently I had trouble sleeping so I bought some phinibut as I figured I could control myself. I did for a couple months dosing twice a week. 

After this period I started feeling like shit and impaired all the time. For whatever reason I decided to take what I was taking those two days and split it throughout the week. I felt great at first and very quickly it lost its luster. Soon every time I dose I get a weird pressure in the front of my head. Now that pressure is always there and when I dose I get a surge of adrenaline and just feel like my brain won't work at all and I don't wanna move.

Wtf is this shit? Ive never taken a drug like this it's a truly a shit situation fucked if you do fucked if you don't. I noticed if I wait till I feel like complete ass to dose I feel some relief and it develops into that headache again.

This is from 900mg a day. This shit is fucking garbage. How do these people on massive doses cope? I've never been addicted to something I hate before. I honestly don't even crave the effects that I got at first. Thinking about phenibut makes me sick. Hands down the crappiest gaba drug ever. Filthy.


EDIT: I took 600 yesterday and 300 today. I feel better today than I did all last month and I only slept 4 hours last night. I don't know what to do now. I am considering just jumping off. 

If it gets bad I will just dose another 300mg. I was so scared a couple days ago. It's been 4 days since I've gotten exercise definitely gonna workout tomorrow.

Two weeks ago, the primal fear, hopelessness, catastrophic thinking all came crashing down, and I started upping my phen (bad idea) I decided yesterday to just go back up on the gaba instead of my usual dose of phen. Worked a charm (kinda) the crushing panic went away and I actually got a couple hours sleep.

I got upto 6.5g phen last week (10g on one day, because I could not make sense of what the hell was going on) but I took 4g yesterday and gabapentin for the remainder of the day. Now, I don't feel great, but 80% better than just tapering the phen. I also have baclofen at my disposal.

Is it inadvisable to jump off the phen straight to the 2,700mg gaba and maybe baclofen for breakthrough anxiety?

I've also been told fasoracetam is a good idea once I'm off the phen completely, or would that clash with the gaba?

In the past few years, I went from using phenibut responsibly to a 2 week binge, to to a full-blown addiction, to another 2 week binge, to abstinence (long breaks, like 4 months) in between. 

I learned some things along the way, and took pretty detailed notes and data from each binge and the full addiction.

Binge #1: 11 days in a row of phenibut usage. Began at 3g, was up to 5g by day 3, and peaked at 11g/day on the final day. Cold turkey, only used 0.5mg kpin #7 for sleep and 30mg CBD during the day.

Binge #2: 12 days in a row. started at 2.5g, up to 6g by day 4, and peaked at 10g before deciding to quit. 0.5mg kpin #7 for sleep and CBD and agmatine during the day. HOWEVER, I took 3.25g and 2.5g phenibut on days 13 and 14 respectively this time.


I tracked my daily anxiety score per ""Mind Over Mood: Anxiety Inventory,"" my ""overall daily satisfaction (subjective),"" sleep statistics (r/ouraRing), and number of negative automatic thoughts per day (r/CBT).


Well, both times, the primal fear part of w/d (arguably rebound not withdrawal but whatever) hit at +36 hours. It peaked at +72 hours, and was fully gone by +96 hours. Caveat: in binge #2, I count the day before dose reduction as t+0.

Both times, I got 8+ hours of sleep per night with Mg, Kpin, melatonin, and CBD. I might be weird, but when I'm on really high (>5g) doses of phenibut I only sleep around 4-5 hours per night. 

TL;DR: 

FINDINGS: my anxiety score peaked higher and 12 hours earlier on my CT binge #1. It was 10 points higher (out of 72). It also resolved more rapidly, with the primal fear subsiding just 60 hours after onset rather than 72 hours, though it was noticeably more severe. However, anxiety reached baseline a full day sooner in binge #2 (day 5, rather than day 6). As for ""PAWS,"" low mood and insomnia are similar in strength and duration. 

ADVICE: If you're coming off of a 1-3 week binge in the 5-15g daily range, I would recommend a rapid taper. Cut your dose in half, twice. So if you're at 8g, take 4g then 2g then 0. If your withdrawals take longer than 36 hours to relatively plateau at their peak, adjust dosage accordingly. Also, you don't need a baclofen taper; you don't need a slow taper. You DO need willpower, as you WILL feel hopeless and awful often. Klonopin was a life saver (my doc and I made sure to only get a small script) for sleep. It's also amazing to take an hour before bed after having such an awful day; such a nice break from w/d's.

I jumped off after tapering over the course of about a week and a half whilst using agmatine and it was relatively painless. 

My last dosage was on Monday in the afternoon and I haven't gotten as extreme of symptoms as I was expecting. 

My symptoms have been: elevated anxiety (sometimes it comes w/ nausea), pins and needles, sometimes an itchy or burning feeling on the skin (most apparent when I'm trying to sleep), and pretty horrid insomnia. 

 I also thought I'd add that I managed to sleep somewhere around 7-8 hours last night with the help of benadryl and melatonin which was great because the nights before I had slept 3 and 4 hours respectively.  I feel like I've felt a bit better today than I did yesterday as well. Less anxiety, but a little more physical discomfort.

Now I know dose is relative, i.e. dependent on multiple factors (weight, starting point etc.). But I’m wondering whether people that take more than say 5g daily also had a higher starting point? And how long did it take to build up to these kind of dosages? Is the intake staggered throughout the day or all in one dose?
Is there a point where you noticed the infamous “glutamate surges” causing an actual daily dose to feel worse than not using it at all?

I noticed that quite a number of people seem to use around 10g and up daily. I haven’t noticed any of the “glutamate surges” myself but have never gone beyond 4g (beyond that I would basically just get sick). At the same time, I can see how the dosage can keep creeping up since that 4g upper bound was something like 2.5g ~5 years ago (when I found out about the stuff).

This got me curious, hence this post. Please don’t take this the wrong way, I don’t want to make the divide between “high” and “low” be 5g or something as I understand it differs per person.

I took 8g or so for 12 days. The following day I took 3.25g, and felt alright. the next day, yesterday, I only took 2g. by night time, I was an anxious mess and took a 0.5mg klonopin to sleep.

Today I took no phenibut; decided to cold turkey and stick it out (with 0.5mg kpin x 10 for sleep, and clonidine for daytime anxiety). I actually felt normal for 4 hours (4-8pm), but then the anxiety came back. Just took a klonopin, going to sleep soon.

So, I've done almost this exact same thing before (11 days, 7g/day). I noticed last time that I felt okay the first day, then had 4 brutal days, then felt fine.

The difference this time is that I started rapidly tapering, so my first brutal day was before I actually went CT.

Because I rapidly tapered, do you think I will have 4 brutal days including the 2 I already had? Or will the first brutal day count for one of the 5?

If the rapid taper started the 5 days, then I only have 2.5 days left of feeling like this. If the true cold turkey with its 5 days of hell begins only went you take your FINAL dose, then I have 3.5 more days of brutal anxiety and depression.

I feel obligated to post this since I got so much help from the community. My story began 2 years ago, when I found phenibut on LM and got a 5g sample. I loved it so much, and had no idea what it's mechanism of action was, and ignored the warning labels of daily use. 

Fast forward a year, I'm on 15-20g of phenibut every single day. It's drilling my bank account and I tried quitting cold turkey-- that was AWFUL, and I realized how insidious this drug really was. Then I turned to Reddit and found this community. I found advice on tapering, which was either horrible, or I just didn't stick to it at all. I think I got down to around 10g a day in a few months of tapering.

I learned about about baclofen. I ordered 90 25mg pills, along with some gabapentin (which I did not end up needing). I went straight from \~10g phenibut per day to 50-75mg baclofen a day, no problems. I listened to my body, and got clean from both phenibut and baclofen in 2 weeks, reducing my baclofen dose as much as possible. 

I was clean from both drugs this Jan/Feb. Until I moved into my new apartment. When unpacking, I found an old 200G tub with about a quarter of it left and you can guess what happens next. I took all of it in about a week, and I was stuck in the same spot. Felt hopeless and like I'd never get off of the drug. I ordered 60 more baclofen, and this time told my girlfriend what was going on. 

I did the same routine as the first time (directly switching), but faster and with less baclofen. I gave the bac to my girlfriend to give me 3x a day, in doses we outlined in a schedule ahead of time. The second time around was SHIT compared to the first; I had 0 sex drive, couldn't sleep more than 2 hours a night, didn't want to do anything, felt constant TERROR from the pandemic, and worried that I wouldn't be able to get phenibut or go to the ER if things got worse.  

But, I made it through. I went from 20g to 10g, to 0g. Then right back to square 1 when the quarantine started and I relapsed. I'm writing this 30 days clean from both drugs, in my new apartment, and I just finished my last exam to graduate! I have a job lined up and life feels good, and I'm basically back to ""normal"".

I'm sorry this is so long and probably confusing I just wanted to thank you guys for all of the advice, I would still be on insane amounts of phenibut daily if it wasn't for this community. There is hope! Keep hammering. It sucks but it's sooooo so so worth it. Feel free to ask me anything :)

TL;DR: Started 2yr ago at \~20g a day, tapered to 10g, directly jumped to 50-75mg baclofen a day. Very little side effects Got clean for 2 months. Relapsed, then did the same switch w/ baclofen.

The toxic feeling effects and anxiety in between doses led me to slowly drop down to 1g/ day by the next year. That’s where I was until February when I quit a longer kratom habit. At the same time I started lowering. Over 2 months got to 100mg, skipped some days on my off days. Last dose I took was 60mg. During the taper times and a few days after I’d notice an irritable dysphoric feeling, less appetite and trouble staying asleep. I never had severe symptoms, just uncomfortable. The withdrawal from kratom was worse in a way but that was a ct from higher dose. 

The first week completely off I had some sleep issues and more fatigued, felt weaker. Still some lingering fatigue but its something I’ve had a while anyways. I’d say the taper was harder than when finally jumping off. 

I’m glad to be off of it; haven’t had any cravings (although I do some with kratom even though I’m 4 months off). 

It’s definitely an endurance marathon to quit, takes a toleration for discomfort and discipline to taper. Very much worth it.

I have been taking phenibut for about a year and a half now.  I started with sleepwalker shots and quickly got up to the point where i was taking them 4-5 days a week and double dosing on a regular basis.  switched to the pills and eventually just bought some of the straight phenibut 250mgs off the internet a couple months ago.  the whole time i've attempted to cycle it and control my use but it's been close to impossible.  generally I have been able to maintain skipping 2 days a week while taking 1000mgs the other 5 days which is out of control.  

So a few weeks ago i decided enough was enough and made a taper schedule where i started taking 750mg on my on days and still taking days off then i dropped to 500mg with days off and finally dropped to 250mg last week but then on my days off this last week ended up going to the convenience store and buying sleepwalker pills and taking those.  Otherwise still sticking to my schedule of 250mgs a day and according to my taper schedule have today and tomorrow at 250 then a day off then 2 more days at 250 then i'm planning on stopping.  

I wanted to share this here in the hopes that actually talking to anyone about it would improve my chances of success.  No one knows about it and I'm in recovery for heroin and a slew of other drugs (it's been almost 4 years there!).  My pride is keeping me from sharing with my recovery network about it.  

Generally my off days are more or less fine but I haven't skipped more than 1 day in a really long time so I'm sort of worried what day 2 might be like.  I have a pretty huge fear of withdrawal after years of being on heroin/benzos/alcohol i guess.  

So if you have any suggestions or care to offer some support I would greatly appreciate it.  I have just enough of the web-bought pills to get through the rest of my taper (4 pills including todays).  Thanks so much!

So last time I posted, it was due to insomnia and discovered I had dropped too quickly as a result of not measuring appropriately.

Since then, I’ve measured every single time, I take it twice a day, almost 12 hours apart each time, and have been tapering 50-75mg a day since. I’ve gone from 1.5g in the AM and 1.8g in the PM to 700mg in the AM and 1g in the PM. I also dose with agmatine with each dose. I do still take kratom as well, it’s something I wish to taper as well, but I want to do one at a time.... Thus far, no issues until a few nights ago.

Began noticing I was waking in the middle of the night and not sleeping again. Decided maybe my body wasn’t liking the taper at the moment and froze the taper to adjust at the above levels. It’s been 3 days at that level and... I just had a full night of insomnia. Which terrifies me. I even took my mag and L-theanine supplement last night but I think all that did was keep me from crying during the insomnia. 

I’m thinking of taking off 100mg from my morning dose and adding it to my night dose to see if it helps.

I was just wondering if anyone else experienced insomnia during a taper like this? I don’t want to have to add more, that’s just... that feels like I’m failing more...

I know the insomnia is causing this fear right now but... ugh, I didn’t want to go through this again and I’ve been careful because of it, trying to take it slow... so I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong...

I made my final decision to quit March 26th about one week into the lockdowns in my area.

I was   not a significantly heavy user probably only 2.500 3.500 and 4.500 grams per day.  Never more than 6gpd.  and I would skip a day or two.

At the end in the winter of this year January February, if I would take ibuprofen for a headache while using phenibut it would cause me a kidney or bladder dysfunction that I would end up having blood in my urine that was very uncomfortable. Six or seven hours after taking ibuprofen I would literally be pissing blood clots out of my dick hole for several hours'.

There would be a sudden urge to urinate but only a trickle would come out and then it would be tinted red with the accompaniment of clots or not.

Again I decided to quit during  last week in March during the second week of lockdown. Fast taper then I was down to zero. I've been off for 72 days. The first month sucked I can basically only lay in bed and drink alcohol. And to be clear when I say alcohol I mean one or two six packs of IPA I'm not talking about a half gallon of vodka.

It's been 2 months and I still have extreme anhedonia low energy no motivation Etc. Now that Summer's beginning I must return to work as a skilled Tradesman in commercial construction and I do not the energy to deal with that lifestyle.

Nothing other than phenibut gives me the energy to do the life thing. I am seriously considering starting on a low  dose so that I can return to work.

It is pathetic to say it but only phenibut gives me the energy to deal with the banality of daily life

Without phenibut I do not possess the wherewithal to deal with the banality of daily life. I simply don't have the energy. On top of that I find everything boring. I do not care about viruses or riots.",5,"{'lockdown': 2, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7978531}"

I wanna keep this relatively short bc I am tired, but I really just had an urge to share with this community and provide some hope to someone in need.

I posted here roughly 4 months ago inquiring on how to kick my 2 gpd habit, and as I expected most everyone agreed a medium-speed taper (50-100mg per day) was the best choice.  I have experienced CT withdrawal against my will and it was hell for me, even on a lower dose. Reallllly didn't wanna deal with that again. So I decided that I was gonna taper.

Wellllll, before I ACTUALLY began the taper, I had been taking a bit less per day (\~1.5) than the previous week for the purpose of limiting my intake. I didn't really think it through and I figured 500mg was no big deal. Well it was fine until about the 3rd day of that. That night I couldn't sleep and had the nocturnal jerks. Next night I was in a full blown panic for about 8 hours straight, shaking in my bed, hearing music and creepy internal monologue. Heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Just complete terror until about an hour before I had to get up and go to work for the day. At work I felt like I was dying, my BP was probably through the fucking roof. And here's the best part: it didn't hit me until THEN that I was going through WD. The phenibut had convinced me that I had some sort of serious and acute medical disorder. That's the worst part of it: the delusions. I proceeded to IMMEDIATELY raise my dose even higher than originally, now at 2.3gpd. The torture stopped and I felt at peace again.

I was so terrified of experiencing that again that I kept taking a little too much every day, and eventually made it up to two doses per day of 2g each, totaling 4 gpd. I thought, ""enough is enough, let's do this taper.""

I stabilized at 4gpd and not a point more for about 5 days. In the meantime, I bought a scale from a headshot (mandatory) and worked out the taper schedule on paper. I calculated the exact amount of phenibut I would need, plus a little cushion in case I needed to stabilize for a few days. I placed the order along with an order of 200g of agmatine.

The actual taper was pretty simple. Twice per day, morning and night, I took 1g of agmatine, waited 30 mins, then took half my daily dose of phenibut, ensuring not to eat 2 hrs before or after my doses. I cut 50mg per day, alternating the doses being cut. So it would go:

Day 1: AM-2g PM-2g ; Day 2: AM-2g PM-1.95g ; Day 3: AM-1.95g PM-1.95g ; Day 4: AM-1.95g PM-1.9g ; ...etc

It went awesome until a point I decided I had balls of steel and was gonna cut 100mg per day. NOPE. Within 3 days I started feeling the terror creeping in. Immediately took 3 days to stabilize and resumed 50mg per day. I continued 50mg per day, without fail, until where I am right now: 150mg per day. I have stabilized at this dose for a few days, and I am going to cut the taper even more by only reducing 10mg per day until it's over.

The best piece of advice I can give is 1. Agmatine, 2g total per day, takes about one week to build up in your system, and 2. EXERCISE DAILY, preferably intense cardio (HIIT sessions) and some strength training. If you're feeling a little shaky, exercise will FUCK UP the withdrawal. Like it doesn't even exist. IMO, exercise is mandatory for a proper taper. Of course, take good care of your general health throughout the process; eat well, drink water.

Guys, if you have any questions, I am here to help as I wanna give back to this community. I would read these threads when I was wanting to quit and it finally motivated me to do it. Tbh, I felt better on the damn taper than I did at 4 gpd. The slow taper is so, so worth it. If you set yourself up for success, it will be a damn joyride. If you get loosey-goosey with it and slack on the health aspect, you have a much higher chance of failure.

Thanks for all your help and support. Couldn't have done it without this community here to inspire me.

They said they couldn't help me if I wasn't willing to go cold turkey, and recommended inpatient. So now I'm back to fast tapering on my own, and looking for baclofen. 

Here's the problem: I'm on a ridiculously tight schedule for getting off phenibut. I need to be totally off by the beginning of August, but I also need to be at 3 grams or lower (from 7.5 currently) by the beginning of July. I have a really important event going on then, and I need to be in the best state of mind I can be. I've heard that all of the glutamate side effects that are causing such problems for me right now ease up at around the 3g mark, which is why I'm aiming for that. I'm tapering pretty well at 250mg/day with memantine and gabapentin, and am probably gonna try ramping it up and going faster soon, but as my dose gets lower I'll probably end up hitting a wall where I'm not able to taper as fast.

I know many people here have had good luck ordering baclofen online from foreign countries. In my experience, shipments from places like that are taking around a month right now, so that won't work. 

I'm not gonna bother asking my GP, as she's told me that she's not comfortable prescribing psychiatric meds outside of depression and anxiety. She said she only even prescribes my bipolar meds because I had already been on them for a while and knew they worked. I know people have also had good luck asking for it for back pain, but I don't know, something about lying to my doctor like that to get a certain medication makes me really... uncomfortable, and I don't know if I'd be able to bring myself to do it.

I called a clinic near me that specializes in addiction today, and they told me it's about a month's wait time to get an appointment.

It's honestly so frustrating that it's so difficult to get a non-recreational, non-controlled medication to help with my taper. Does anyone have any ideas for a faster way to get baclofen? Should I maybe try finding a psychiatrist? I imagine there's gonna be a decent waitlist there too, especially with all the covid-19 stuff going on.

I was drinking those red dawn drinks that they sell at the gas station, thinking I probably was drinking too much caffeine. Over the past few years my anxiety has increased and I started having occasional panic attacks. Recently the manufacturers changed the ingredients and upped the price,  so I decided it was time to stop buying it. The first day I drank about 1/4 the normal amount of the NEW red dawn. Woke up the next morning with terrible anxiety, racing heart, sweating and cold chills. Googled those symptoms and red dawn.. found these threads about phenibut. This gave me a revelation that my past panic attacks were all linked to weeks I would drink too much of this drink, and the day I cut back I would have a panic attack. The next week following the panic attack my heart would race and I would try not to drink much because I thought the caffeine was making my anxiety worse. I now know I was experiencing PAWS. 

After realizing this and out of fear of severe WD symptoms, I drank a normal dose of phenibut in the form of the new red dawn. My anxiety did not slow, however, and I started experiencing a pins and needles sensations prickling all over my body. Terrified, I ordered Phenibut and a scale online, hoping to taper safely. I took CBD oil (maybe 60 mg total) throughout the day and a vitamin(Olly Stress) that contains GABA, L-theatine, and lemon balm. I also took kratom to help with the anxiety, and a cbd gummy with melatonin to help me sleep. 

The next morning was **Day 1** cutting back. I estimated I had been taking about 1.5 gpd based on a thread about limitless, which has a similar and dangerously vague ingredient list. I tried taking 1/4 again warily, scared that the new version of red dawn had different ingredients that were giving me a bad reaction. I was correct. The pins and needles feeling that had faded overnight immediately returned. My phenibut order was estimated to arrive 3 days later. So I decided to do a drastic taper rather than drink the new red dawn again. Day 1 was awful. Severe anxiety, racing thoughts,  skin crawling, rapid heartbeat, no appetite, headache, dry mouth. I spent the day in bed. Attempted yoga but could not focus. Went for a walk in the woods, prayed and cried. Reflected on my habits and resolved to quit both phenibut and kratom after feeling the PHYSICAL reaction of my dependence. I am journaling my dosages and plan to cut back. Day 1 I took about .5 g Phenibut, 75 mg CBD total, dosed kratom 3 times, and took the stress vitimans 2 times. I felt the most relief out in the woods. Made sure to drink plenty of water and ate one entire meal that was protein based.

**Day 2**: Very restless sleep, aching joints, headache. I awoke with severe anxiety, immediately took CBD oil and stress vitimans. I found a very old bottle of red dawn, and decided to micro dose in hopes it would keep my body from complete shock, since my habit has been for years. My heart rate was still increased and I was hyperaware of it, and my skin still felt like it was crawling. The skin sensation is almost like an individual pin prick, randomly happening in different places. Uncomfortable but not unbearable. My muscles in my arms started twitching. I went for a 20 min run in the woods and did an ab workout for another hour. The most relief from anxiety happened during my workouts. I cried in the shower and went to work for a few hours which helped me leave my own head momentarily. Total I took maybe .1 or .05 mg Phenibut, dosed a slightly reduced amount of kratom 3x, stress vitimans 2x, 75 mg CBD, melatonin and 165 mg magnesium for the body aches at night. I also had 75 mg caffiene, realizing I was probably withdrawing from caffiene as well-- this can cause shaking,  and rapid heartbeat. I wrote about how I was feeling which was very cathartic. Drank plenty of water and managed to eat half of my lunch and my entire dinner. No intense pins and needles sensation, so I fully attribute that to the new version of red dawn (possibly the excessive amount of B12 in it?)

**Day 3**: Restless sleep, no body aches thanks to magnesium. Awoke to anxiety and a racing heart, CBD and stress vitimans helped. Micro dosed phenibut again, concerned because I have read day 3 and 4 can be the most severe. Mild tremors in the muscles in my arms. Mild skin crawling sensation. My  anxiety has lifted some and is being replaced with determination to keep going and be free of this. I took a reduced dose of kratom and went for another 20 min run/hike in the woods. Felt decent and almost normal in the middle of my workout.

I will continue to update. This thread has saved my sanity and has been very encouraging. When my phenibut arrives tomorrow.. should I continue to micro dose? Or just make the jump now if I can make it through the next day or so? Any advice is very much welcome.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76653117}"

most guys tell me that taking Phenibut 1.5g twice a week is too much.

But what about taking Phenibut once a week and Baclofen once a week with three days in between?

Or would this raise tolerance to both substances?

Advice appreciated",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5929278}"

So how long does it take for agmatine to really start working? A few days, a week?

And also what is the recommended dosing and how many times a day. This does decrease glutamate storms right? And finally..should you take it before or inbetween phenibut doses. Sorry for all the questions and thanks",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5872835}"

Really, you want emotional support from a stranger on the internet? I was blind but now I see. I'm drowning.

So I've been on and off phenibut for the past year or so. More time off than on. For the past 3-4 months of course I've been fucking around with it. Kicked the Kratom habit, but my phenibut use increased because of this. First 2 or so months was 1 gram, sometimes less a day. Rapid suboxone taper to get off the Kratom, thought I was whistling past the graveyard but it really helped. Then I bumped up to 2 grams a day. And now the past two weeks I've been taking 3-5 grams a day.

You might think, ""calm down there buddy, you weren't on it long. Taper will suck but you got this.""

A month ago my addictionologist introduced me to gabapentin, her intent was to have me switch over. She'd had other clients that had a much easier time tapering off of that instead. What did I do? I continued my doses of phenibut AND abused the gabapentin. The doses were so scattered, I guess I'm averaging 1600 mg of that a day. Made phenibut feel like it used to. I could blame it on turbulence in my relationship, but really it was stupidity.

Drove to the store this morning, bought kratom... then thankfully convinced myself to throw it out of the window. Money well spent.

My girlfriend is being very sweet about this, and I love her dearly for it, but I don't think she fully comprehends this kind of addiction. ""Well you've been through heroin withdrawal, this will be a cake walk.""

I have another appointment with my Doctor at 12:30 today, I'm going to tell her everything. My only thinking is that she'll recommend tapering down the phenibut and just maintaining my gaba dose. I did find a good detox clinic near me, however. Always been so calm and collected, always been the one friends came to for advice. Yet here we are.

Had to get up from my desk at work and go to the bathroom because I felt like I was going to cry halfway through writing this. I want someone to throw me in a room and lock the door behind them. All the chances my family has given me and here we go again. A pathetic wretch that's slowly killing himself and hurting everyone he loves.

Anywho... Thanks for reading, I hope everyone else is doing a little better than I am.",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4106353}"

How long to rebound from phen blues?","So I'm not well versed in phenibut. I wanted some help through kratom withdrawals and tried phen, I didn't really feel 1g, so I took another 1g and honestly didn't feel much. It mostly made me feel drowsy and less coordinated.

I was experimenting with different amounts and before I knew it I was taking it 4 days a week for 2 weeks. Since stopping sleep has been a nightmare, getting 4 hoursish and my anxiety had gone through the roof. I'll wake up in a panic and can't get back to sleep. It's been about 5 days since I stopped and the last 2 nights have been better but still bad.
