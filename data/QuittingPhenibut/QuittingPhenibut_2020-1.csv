I’m new here. Dont use reddit much.  Ive taken about 500mg every 3-4 days for Less than a year. (For sure since the start of last summer.) I never thought much of it, but lately I’ve been super anxious a lot of the time. I’m not sure if it’s PMS/hormonal or due to the phenibut, but I’m thinking of stopping for a while.

Should I go down to 250mg every 3-4 days at first? Or is it okay to stop completely? 

I took l-Theanine a couple times today, and it helped a lot. Still a bout jumpy, but not as bad.

any suggestion from people who never had daily or high dose use?",2,0

Phenibut rebound gave me terrible tinnitus and it took me a while to actually realize it was the cause. I also take daily vyvanse and 1.5 Ativan prescribed. I really enjoyed phenibut for the sex drive it gave me. Which leads me to believe it’s very dopaminergic. I would take phen, alcohol and adderall, go to the club and grind my dick all over girls. If I took it on a Friday, my brain would be fried by Tuesday. Brain fog and tinnitus have been the worst side effects for me. I actually had an ER visit back in November because of a blood pressure spike. They checked my blood and found potassium deficiency. They administer 4 potassium pills and I felt great after. Keep your potassium levels up guys!

The brain fog and tinnitus still hasn’t completely gone away, but it’s gotten much better. I’m still having bad days here and there. I feel stupid for letting phenibut grab a hold of me after already going thru withdrawal from 360mg daily addiction to Percocet 10 years ago. After that, I stayed off everything including alcohol and weed for 7 years. I’m going to mention a few supplements I’ve taken that I think have helped below. Keep in mind sometimes none of these things work and you feel like they’re actually making you worse. So change it up when things aren’t going well.

Fasoracetam (obviously beneficial)

Ashwaganda (good for sleep)

Glycine (great in combo with ashwaganda before bed)

Taurine (helps with tinnitus and sleep)

9-mbc (tyrosine hydroxylase. Probably the most beneficial for my problems)

Black seed oil (works at low doses. Too much and it’s bad. 

Creatine (wipes out the brain fog)

Niagen (very beneficial, but also very expensive)",7,0

So, I normally take 10g of phenibut/day. When I take my doses, I basically weigh out the dose, then roll it up into pieces of toilet paper and swallow those so I don't have to taste the phenibut. 

Well, my sleeping schedule has been weird lately, and last night, I basically woke up, weighed out my dose, rolled it up into the pieces of toilet paper, I took it, and went back to sleep.

Well, I was pretty out of it, and wasn't really paying attention. This morning, I just realized that I missed one of the little rolled up doses of phenibut. I literally just forgot to take it because I was too tired to notice. Those little rolled up doses are around 2g, which means I accidentally missed a whole 2g from my dose last night.

Now, I'm freaking out, because the last time I missed just .5g, I had absolutely HELLISH anxiety for close to a week before I ""stabilized"" and felt normal again. If that happens again this time, but with an entire 2g, I honestly don't know how I would make it through that, I'm seriously not sure I could.

When I found the dose I missed, I took it right away, but this was 17 hours after I was supposed to have taken it.

So basically, my question is, do you think I'll be fine having taken it 17 hours later, or am I completely screwed? I barely pulled through when I missed just .5g, I seriously think I have to go through a week like that again but 4 times as bad I won't make it.

At the moment, I feel alright, outside of the anxiety from realizing that I missed that dose, but obviously phenibut withdrawal takes a while to kick in, so I wouldn't be noticing it yet.

I guess I'll find out on my own soon enough, but if I'll probably be fine, the reassurance would be nice, so any opinions on the matter are appreciated. Thanks in advance!",4,0
7,2020-01-27 23:51:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ev0sgv/check_in/,Check in,"Hi all, recently I discovered I was physically addicted to kratom and have since quit, however that experience has me examining some of my other substance use. I’ve been using phenibut for roughly 3 years with minimal side effects as far as I can tell. I usually take it 1 or 2 days a week, sometimes back to back but usually spaced out by a day or so. Roughly once a year I take it for an extended period (3-5 days) during work conferences where I need to be social and network. Sometimes I take a break for 2 weeks or so. Thus far the only side effects I think I’ve experienced is feeling a bit down or drained after the extended use periods. Until the kratom situation I assumed I was using relatively responsibly but wanted to check if anyone here has had a similar use pattern which ended up causing them problems.

Edit: forgot my dosage - usually dose 1 or 2 times per day at 1.5 to 2 grams per dose. Sometimes a 3rd dose but usually just 2 at the most.",2,0

I will start off by saying phenibut did more damage than any other substance I have used for my mental health. A year ago I started having adverse effects on phenibut and it was a living hell so decided to kick the garbage substance. The taper lasted around 40 days and it was a so brutal that I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I literally thought I would die or end up in a mental hospital. I literally went to 5 different doctors within the first 2 weeks of tapering because I became a hypochondriac. I have never been mentally defeated and I felt so hopeless that it would never get better. Literally the worst experience in my adult life... I am a year free of it and I would say I'm at 90% back to normal but easily have PTSD from that experience. I will never be my old self but learning to rebuild with what I got. If you feel like you need to stop then please do. I regret ever touching that stuff. I have quit benzos, opiates, ssri's, and cannabis. Nothing comes close to the hell I experienced this past year. If you are trying to quit know that it will take a very long time to return back to normal and never lose hope that it will happen. I should have been smarter with it because I took it every day if you are doing this, please stop while you're ahead. I can't tell y'all what to do with your body but wanted to share my experience in case others are struggling with it. It will get better over time!",12,0

I had a short, but heavy binge. 25 grams in a week in a half, no real tolerence. Previously I had a year+ long affair with RC benzos, and kicked those like a champ, so I really didn't think this would be such a big issue.

  


Oh hell no I was wrong. I spend all day so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open. Bedtime rolls around? Wired. I sleep for 1 or 2 hours, wake up, and VERY depressing thoughts race through my mind, keeping me up all night. Sun starts to come up, fatigue hits again. Maybe I get another hour or two before I have to be up, and then it all starts again.

Doctors here aren't going to help, and to get ANY chemical to my door, including phenibut, is going to be 1-2 weeks minimum. It's driving me nuts.

This is only day 3. I think this is at most a mild withdrawl coupled with the same old rebound symptoms, but not even the benzo withdrawal was this wild with the insomnia! And it didn't even help me sleep in the first place, really. Somehow most nights on it, I'd do just fine off 5-6 hours. The aforementioned depression thoughts are new for me, too. I've always had anxiety issues, but never really depression, even though they typically go hand in hand. Day 3 here and I just wanna blow my brains all over the floor. I'm a fuck up for about a million more reasons than just the dope. And my muscles/head, fucking ow. Never again. I've been down this path too many god damn times.

  


I find it hard to believe that one night soon, I'll drift off and actually get a restful number of hours under my belt, not when it's so torturous. Fuck.

But yet no withdrawal. And yesterday I completely ran out and my withdrawal was starting to get bad head was shaking. Heart pounding and sweaty and nervous and even having auditory hallucinations. But I ordered l theanine from Amazon this morning and just a big dose and I'm pretty much back to normal accept for the tremors. But that's ok I guess. But my mood feels calmer too. Much more leveled. Withdrawal symptoms at an all time low. Almost gone? Weird. If this is what it does then I am going to start taking l theanine from now on.

I've been tapering for almost a year now with gabapentin. I couldn't break past the 2g mark without the usual sweats and overwhelming anxiety. I take 1.5mg xanax/day, 2100mg gabapentin and 12.5mg zolipidem for sleep. 20 mg of Lexapro for serotonin reuptake. Still nothing.

The Dr prescribed 100mg of Seroquel at night because I get 4 hours of sleep at best. I took a week off of work and said this is it, I'm putting this shit to rest once and for all. I stepped down 500mg every night for four days and slept for nearly 12 hours each night, waking up only to eat a bit and take my meds. 

Day 5 and no phenibut, took the usual regimen of other meds and no side effects other than drowsiness from the Seroquel. 3 days left on my ""vacation"" and I'm confident that this is it. No real side effects other than a bit of anxiety and some light sweats. Hoping for a miracle here and that it continues to go this well.

I was wrong.,"I read that phenibut doesnt cause withdrawals like  every 4 hours. It's supposed to take longer. And that what we are feeling isnt withdrawals. Its glutamate toxicity. Our body is trying to deal with all the extra glutamate. 

When the gaba b receptor is messed with. It increases glutamate. It's why fitness junkies use phenibut, their trying to increase human growth hormones all theoretically...check out this link. It described what was happening to me. I found this on a phenibut reddit post of a physical trainer in the hospital for this, from taking 7 grams a day, for a year. The symptoms match us. 

The info in this link explains what happens when we have too much glutamate. When we keep upping the dose of phenibut we get a worse feeling, especially after  dosing, instead of getting better for a while. Like we did when we would increase the dose when we did low doses. It got better for at least a few weeks before going up even higher. Just opposite when we up the dose on mega doses

I take a week  break, every two months-- I  Had a day of restless, and I  slept 4 hours the 1st and second night. I felt better by the 3rd day. Then by the 7th day I started using again at 500mgs. It really wasn't bad. Mostly just missed the looseness feeling. 

But I'm wondering -- in another month or two, if I break again what kind of taper schedule would work if doing 2 month intervals of 500 to 750mgs daily doses ? 

Would it benefit a two month usage break ? Or should I just continue doing it the way I did ? Just stopping after two months wasn't  bad. 

But I'm curious if a taper would even be worth bothering every two months ?

Yes I know daily use isnt recommended.

Can several servings of diet soda everyday cause a problem or exaserbate symptoms during a phenibut taper? I was reading about Agmatine and plan to pick some up this weekend but then I kept reading about aspartame. I had been drinking 4 or so 16oz servings of diet soda everyday for weeks and suffering some interdose ""WD"" symptoms like inner vibrations that are pretty bad and racing anxious thoughts on a 3x/day phenibut regimen. I wasn't even reducing but never ""stabilizing"". Could this have something to do with it?

>Thus, **aspartame** acts as an **agonist** of glutamate on the **NMDA** receptor (Fountain et al., 1988). ... It can be released from the astrocytes as GABA or it can be reabsorbed into the neuron as glutamine (for conversion into either glutamate or GABA).

I also read that 50% of it is metabolized (or more) as phenylalaline, the precursor for tyrosine, which is metabolized into dopamine and noradrenaline. I decided to take 24hrs off of diet soda to see if there's a correlation, might make it all weekend, and pick up some Agmatine tomorrow.

Sidenote: I was drinking diet to save the calories and cut down on excess sugar. I'm not overweight, 6'1 and 170-175lbs, but wasn't trying to get there. I also have diabetes in my family, my Father passed away from it and sweet stuff doesn't taste good to me anymore. My body sends a signal that it doesn't want it, almost sickly sweet, so it seemed logical. I'll share my findings in due time but considering Agmatine apparently works wonders by antagonizing NMDA, wouldn't cutting out Aspartame have a noticable effect? We'll see.",8,0

How can I stop and will I have long term negative effects from taking it so long?,"As the title says, I've been dependent of phenibut for 7 years. Initially there was the honeymoon period, then I increased my dose tremendously (I started with probably 3 grams, I honestly didn't get many effects until I took at least 2 grams,IDK why). About 6 years ago, I was taking 40 grams a day (and up to 60 grams), then I tapered gradually down to 6 grams. This wasn't too bad or hard. I would feel incredibly disinterested in everything for about 2 or 3 days and then the next day feel normal again (My neurotransmitter re-regulation has always been pretty quick, which is a blessing). It was also easier because I didn't have a job. Once I got to 6 grams though, I took a break from tapering for a month or so after only having a few days a week where I could enjoy things. 

Then I tried to taper to I think either 5 or 5.5 grams from 6 (which was a much lower % than the other tapers) and I felt much more  dysphoria, boredom, anxiety, had terrible sleep and just a general discomfort physically and mentally/emotionally and it lasted for a week without any noticeable improvement before I broke and took 6 grams again and stopped tapering. That was 5 years ago

 Since then I got a job and I gradually would take about 0.01 grams a day less til I got to 5.5 grams, but in the last few months I've had a lot going on and have self medicated to being at 7.5 grams then to the current 9.5 grams a day. 

If you're wondering why I tapered down so slowly, It's because I once came off probably between 5 and 8 grams ( not sure exactly, I was just throwing spoonfuls into water without measuring) cold turkey. I've been through so other wds and they suck, but coming off phenibut cold turkey was so far beyond anything else in every respect. I thought I was losing my mind, extreme dysphoria, depression, constant panic and almost psychedelic levels of disturbed thought. It was as bad as the worst bad trips I've had but it that lasted for 3 days. I didn't know what was happening at the time, I thought I had fried my brain and would either be institutionalized or if it didn't get better, commit the S word (I don't even want to type it, it scares the hell out of me). 

Anyway, I'm ready to finally get off this stuff; however, because I've grown to fear the WDs, Time is not the biggest issue, I just want to taper in a way that avoids the minimizes the WD symptoms and be off of it in no longer than 6 to 7 months (quicker if possible, if I can still avoid most of the wd symptoms or at least ones of intensity).  Any taper advice would be greatly appreciated.

The other thing I'm a bit worried about is if I'll be OK when I get off of it since I've been on it for such a long time, or is there lingering Post withdrawal symptoms? Nothing permanent I hope. Any information will be helpful.

I used 750mg per day for about 18 months. I tapered 50mg per day using baclofen and then tapered the baclofen. At 6 months off, I'm still pretty messed up and definitely not back to my baseline self. Most of my symptoms are anxiety related. I just have a constant very high level of anxiety and it manifests in a variety of ways from physical symptoms to panic attacks to derealization. I do have good days, but I still feel far away from being 100% recovered. To be clear, I am not expecting to feel perfect, just back to how I was before Phenibut.

* Has anyone experienced a long withdrawal/paws period and had their brain heal to the point that they feel 100%?
* How long did it take and what did it feel like?
* What helped you during that process? (Supplements, Drugs, Exercise, etc.)

42,2020-01-15 14:33:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ep7309/otc_supplement/,OTC Supplement,"Hi everyone,

So I'm dealing with a delayed USPS delivery of my phenibut. Ran out yesterday and I was concerned about w/d for work today. I went to a local supplement shop in my area to see if they had any overpriced drinks or capsules containing Phenibut.

I didn't see any on the shelves so I asked the guy at the counter. He pulled out a few different bottles of stuff and we looked thru them until we found one with Phenibut listed. It's called ""Far Beyond Driven"" and lists Caffeine Anhydrous, Phenibut, Green Tea Extract (including Theophylline, Theobromine, and L-Theanine), Guarana Seed Extract, Yohimbine HCL, and Rauwolfia Vomitoria.

As expected it was expensive. The bottle costs $40 and contains 60 capsules. Of course the ingredient list does not specify the amount of Phenibut in each capsule so I emailed the company and asked. They actually replied fast and the guy told me each capsule contains 375mg of Phenibut.

Normally I would need to take a lot of them, but the recommended dose is 1 capsule at a time, no more than 2 in a day. Being unsure of how it would affect me I took 2 capsules and went about my day. This stuff definitely gives you energy. The bottle says ""Elevate mood, insane focus, crazy weight loss fat burner."" I'm not sure what it is affecting me but I definitely have a fairly non-jittery energy boost with pretty significant clarity and focus. The feeling is not something I generally enjoy and I doubt I'll be taking it again but it's actually a pretty decent product.

I don't notice much of a Phenibut effect but I'm not really experiencing w/d so far so I'm satisfied. The energy boost I'm feeling can be unpleasant or undesirable to some, also.

So in conclusion, the purpose of this post is to provide information in case anyone finds themselves in the situation I'm in. If you can find this product (or something similar) then it will probably hold you over. Just be prepared for the other effects. Also, I wouldnt take too much. The energy boost could easily become unpleasant or overwhelming.

** UPDATE: So I had taken the 2 capsules around 11am. It is now 7pm. Overall, it did a pretty good job at holding off w/d. Not crazy about the energy aspect. While I wouldn't really consider it jittery, I did/do feel pretty racy. It's not a terrible feeling but it is pretty uncomfortable and I've been looking forward to it going away. I think it's possible that I may have actually enjoyed it if I was on a comfortable Phenibut dose.

TL;DR: Found Phenibut-containing supplement at local shop called ""Far Beyond Driven"" with (allegedly) 375mg pheni in each capsule. Has potentially undesirable energy side effects.",8,0

Warning,"About 5 months ago, I discovered phenibut and started using it once a week for recreational/social purposes. I'm a pretty introverted and sometimes socially anxious person so it worked wonders for me. It didn't really make me feel super high or euphoric, it just made me feel nice. Lately I got a bit sloppy with my doses, sometimes taking a bit more than normal. Last weekend, I took 3 doses of 1g in the span of around 48 hours, starting on Friday morning before work, having one Friday evening, and finishing up Saturday morning. I thought I was fine as I came off it Sunday but on Monday I had anxiety the likes of which I can't remember the last time having. Tuesday I had a minor panic attack at work and anxiety. Monday night I slept horribly and I've yet to see if I can sleep tonight (posting at 12:30am Wednesday). I don't really have anything else to attribute these sudden effects to other than the phenibut. About 5 minutes ago I poured the rest of mine down the toilet. If phenibut works for you, that's great, but for me, the good feeling it gives is not worth the withdrawal anxiety, even if it's only slight withdrawal.

Now everything has changed. I get withdrawals after only 3 hours of my doses. And even when I take my dosage I never feel quite right. I have not been able to sleep at all and it is getting worse. 

I am now trying to reel it in and allowing myself only a morning mid day and evening dose, with the hope to taper. 

I am thinking of getting some baclofen to help taper. I do not think jumping off cold turkey even with the baclofen is a good idea, as a month ago I went one day without it and went into full blown psychosis and had to go to the hospital. 

I have constant stomach pain and constipation and worry so much what this is doing to my body. I just want out of this and am so upset I let it get this bad. I used to be able to easily taper when I wanted to and I’m kicking myself for not quitting back before this became such a dire issue.

I'm a 46 year old professional who had a hysterectomy about 9 years ago. I immediately went into early menopause and developed insomnia. I went about 1 year or so with hardly any sleep. I could easily fall asleep every night but I'd wake up after 2 hours tops and that was it for the night. I was a wreck. I tried all that I could over the counter- melatonin, z-quil, heavy drinking, you name it. My Dr put me on Ambien which didn't help a bit. I tried trazadone as well which was useless to me. Every part of my life was suffering. A friend of mine suggested phenibut and gave me a few to try. I was desperate and willing to try anything. I took one 500 mg capsule and slept that night for the first time in 1 1/2 years! I was beyond elated and relieved. My friend suggested the on/off again dosage so I wouldn't get hooked, but it helped me sleep, so I thought what could be the harm in taking a small dose every day. I've been taking it every day for the past 7 or so years. Went up to 1000 mg in order for it to continue to work, then 1500 mg. Took the 1500 dosage for about 5 years. I never thought I was hooked- only knew that if I skipped it I didn't sleep, which was the case before I found it, so no surprise. About a year ago, was having trouble finding it- the nutritional website I bought it from was out of stock for months. I got nervous (but never ran out) about the fact I was depending on it, so wanted to try and wean myself off and find an alternative. I was able to get down to 1000 mgs and that was it. Anyway, I came across GABA at the drugstore the other day and thought it was about the same thing- for $15 less per bottle! For shits and giggles I took 750 mgs of GABA that night and 500 phenibut. Didn't sleep. Tough day at work the next day. 2nd night I eliminated the phenibut and took 1500 mgs GABA. No sleep. Bad next day- yesterday. I thought maybe I just needed to get used to the change. Last night I did the same thing. This morning was awful. Absolutely exhausted but full of anxiety and agitation. Felt so so sick.. nauseous, horrible headache. I thought maybe I was coming down with the flu. But, I should have been able to sleep if that were the case! I started poking around online and read about the awful withdrawals from phenibut and found this group mentioned. Wow, I am shocked and completely awakened to the dangers of this drug. I had no idea! All of these years I thought this was my miracle life saving ""supplement"". Obviously me just quitting cold turkey isn't a good idea. I took a 500 mg capsule and eventually started feeling a little better today. After reading many of your stories (thank you!!!) I decided to order Agmatine to help myself taper off. After learning of the dangers and addiction properties today, I'm pissed! At myself for not researching more in the beginning (I was just so thankful for the sleep help!)

&#x200B;

I was 16, and had been struggling with social anxiety, tics and depression for years. I didn't want to get therapy again because of having had a bad experience with an underqualified therapist, so I tried for a while to find ways to self-medicate.

&#x200B;

I tried alcohol, and that just seemed to give me a temporary boost in mood and social ability for a little while only to rob me of it the next day, and it made me feel worse than before so I eventually quit that. I also tried Saint John's worth, but it didn't do much to me.

&#x200B;

Finally I heard about Phenibut and I heard plenty of good stories about it, along with a few bad ones from people that consumed insane amounts of it everyday, but I wasn't gonna be one of those, so I placed my order for 50 grams and it got to me in more or less a week.

&#x200B;

First impression? Tastes fucking terrible and barely seems to do anything to me at 1 gram, so I thought that I had to increase the dosage. Eventually I started taking 3 grams in the morning along with a energy drink (In retrospect, if I had known my chemistry instead of diluting it I could've avoided that terrible taste by mixing it with baking soda, but whatever). I gradually felt the effects afterwards; I was more chill, I was happier overall and I felt good, but it didn't take me much to notice that I just didn't feel the same. 

&#x200B;

I was me, but paradoxically sometimes I felt like I wasn't in proper control of my emotions, in times where I should've taken things more seriously I just shrugged it off like it all didn't matter, be it study or someone provoking me. I'm sure that my classmates and the other people around me noticed how strange I was, and probably thought that I was baked or something. I also had some problems with forming memories, and all this time on Phenibut felt like a blur afterwards. Like I had been watching a boring movie or something of the sorts, like I had been a spectator to my own life and it had been playing on his own.

&#x200B;

Week 2, and with an average of 3 grams a day I was starting to run low on my 50g supply, but I also realized that this stuff was potent and could help me out on bad days. So I decided to completely go cold turkey right there and then (Bad move, but that was my reasoning).

&#x200B;

First 24 hours I feel normal, after that I become completely unable to sleep and concentrate, but somehow my brain's racing even without a single thought in it.

The lack of sleep makes me feel incredibly tired, but no matter how much I try I just can't sleep more than two hours a day, even after taking a good amount of Valium. I lacked the strength to do anything, and it felt almost like I had a terrible fever. I knew rationally that it was all gonna pass, but another part of me felt like I was going to die, like I'd never recover, and I really wanted to die back then and there, but luckily I had no energy to act on that.

&#x200B;

This whole ordeal lasted about three days, and after about a week I was more or less back to normal. I'll never forget how terrible it felt, I never felt that level of hopelessness and exhaustion in all of my time dealing with my problems, and I've not even come close since.

&#x200B;

After that, I kept my promise to myself and just used it on the days where I felt like crap but still had to get stuff done, and I did that until it eventually ran out. Haven't touched the stuff ever since.

&#x200B;

What you should take out of this is, like with many other stories about Phenibut, that you don't fuck around with this molecule. They may call it a ""supplement"" or whatever, but this is as legit of a drug as it gets. It will help you if taken in the right amounts at max a few times a week, but if you take it every day you WILL get addicted. And if you're ever forced to quit cold-turkey even out of your own choice, know that Phenibut withdrawal is hell. 

If you suffer from mental illness, seek proper medical attention, and don't try to self-medicate like my dumbass self. 

At best this can be alright as a complement to therapy if it doesn't interact with the other medicines, but you just can't make it your main course and rely on it.",4,0

I have done this before and was worried but I believe I finally may have crossed the line into dependence.  

I have had a few bouts with this substance where I was able to taper quickly and quit altogether for a few weeks.  The last time I tapered I had this excruciating sense of primal fear for a few days that came in waves.   It’s crazy.  I can take this stuff daily for weeks, even months, keep my dosage and pretty low (>1.5 g), feel the anxiolytic effects of it, but then it “turns” on me out of nowhere.  I get to a place where it takes me to the primal fear place if I take it and the same if I start to withdraw.  It becomes a living hell and there’s no escape.  I don’t quite know for sure that I’m in the same place right now, but I certainly feel like shit today, having suicidal thoughts, feeling shaky and scared.  I have been taking .75 - 1.5 g daily for about three months.  I started feeling this way yesterday so I took 2.5 over the course of the day in 500 mg increments to try and see if withdrawal was causing my issues.  Today I took 1.75 grams.  I have also been taking a ton of kratom which could be my problems.  Also, I take Wellbutrin and Celexa is which I have stopped since I stated taking phenibut.  

Either way, can’t really talk to my wife about this, and it helps me to get it off my chest here.  I’ll survive.  I’m gonna keep tapering and hopefully get this shit behind me for good,  The issue I have without it is how fucking anxious and scared I feel all the time when I don’t take it.    I don’t know what to do sometimes.  I have a 3 year old daughter and another little girl on the way.  I HAVE to find a way to survive this fucking world without abusing substances.   I am 2 years sober from alcohol and a nasty adderall addiction, but now I’m definitely addicted to kratom and on the verge, If not already dependent on phenibut.  FML",9,0

I quit phenibut and went to rehab because I realized I had to get off everything to be happy but I had been on gabapentin for a long time and started getting withdrawals from that. I left rehab like a dumbass but I’m going back anytime a bed opens up, should be within the next few days. All I had to take was baclofen so I’ve been using it daily for about 7 days and plan to keep using it until I go into treatment. I’m either not having gabapentin withdrawals anymore or I’m just not noticing them because of the baclofen, but I can’t imagine baclofen would take away the symptoms entirely because it works on gaba b, and gabapentin does not. So I’m not really sure if my withdrawals are just not happening anymore or if it’s because of the baclofen I’m not noticing it. I don’t want to withdrawal off something else along with the Kratom withdrawal I’m about to go through. I’ve been on Kratom for years in super high dosages so it won’t be easy. I used to be one of the people who didn’t think Kratom had withdrawals until I went through it myself. So yes this has nothing to do with phenibut but I can’t find any info on this on the internet. I’ve been using about 100 mg a day in two separate doses. Thank you all for the continued support. I got off phenibut but now I need to get off everything else, and 2020 is gonna be the year I do that.

My phenibut usage started in the summer of 2018. I found phenibut while trying to seek relief for my anxiety. I wasn’t a daily user.  I used phenibut 2-3 times a week (1 gram give or take) and sometimes went weeks without using it all.  There was also instances where I’d dose consecutive days.  Needless to say, my dosing was pretty sporadic but definitely regular most times.  December of 2018 was my last go around with phen. I had used it on consecutive days for some social events. Long story short, after that social event I intended to not take anymore and I was hit with some extreme rebounds (I would call it withdrawal because I was experiencing high BP, tachycardia, and all the other mental crap that comes with WD).  Anyway, at that point I proceeded with a quick taper and threw out the rest of my phen and rode it out. It took me about a month to feel some what mentally normal again. 

Fast forward to today... 

I haven’t touched phenibut or any other substance for that matter. This past year since discontinuing phenibut has been a tough one. My anxiety is worse than it ever was before phenibut. I even still have bouts of foggyness, depersonalization/derealization and just a general feeling of mental discomfort and discontent which I didn’t have before phen. I’m just beginning to wonder will the anxiety and mental condition that phen WD created and/or amplified ever go back to baseline?

I wanted to put that gun in my mouth so many times the last few fucking days, I cleared the mag the chamber and gave it to to my fucking girlfriend. I have never fucking experienced withdrawals like that and I’ve kicked heroin many times. 

Blood pressure over 200 at some points,ekg had abnormalities heart rate 150’s whites of my eyes changed, my skin literally turned orange the last few days I was taking 20g+ just trying to feel better but couldn’t keep it down long enough for it to absorb so I’d puke into a strainer and swallow it again. The brain zaps oh my god the FUCKING brain zaps. Every time I tried to sleep I’d wake up and gasp bc I wasn’t breathing or get slapped every few seconds with another zap.

I WENT From 2g a day to about 15g a day in 2 months bc tolerance builds so fast. I didn’t sleep the last like 6-7 for days literally pacing having panic attacks seeing things hearing this when I laid down it was like something was crawling under me my vision would black in and out.

3 days in the hospital they got my fluids back up and my blood pressure mostly down, started eating again but felt like shit and still wasn’t sleep but maybe 30 minutes a night and they were giving me 2 types sleeping pills that normally would put you out. Nobody understood what the drug was or what I was going through. The doctors were honestly oblivious to what was happening
So the last day they went over my vitals and blood tests and said I could go.

That same fucking night here comes another fucking panic attack from hell and what do I do? I fucking do it all over again, back to the ER. This time they send me to a detox. I sat in there 14 hours without them hardly talking to me, waiting on a pancake bed, took all my belongings from me I knew they couldn’t do much so I said fuck it. I decided I’m ready to man up and face this shit or die trying i left, got a Uber, and drank alcohol till i passed out for about 2 hours.

Thats was yesterday night. Then I made a post and everyone was like fucking start dosing again fucking do it and taper down. So i was like fuck maybe they’re right maybe that’s the only way I’m going to survive any of this but I couldn’t find any last night. All the fucking shops were closed i even talked my girlfriend into letting me do it because she could see the pain in me. BUT IT WAS NEW YEARS DAY NOTHING WAS OPEN. So I said fuck it i have to work again tomorrow and if i don’t get some sleep i might literally turn schizophrenic I took a couple Valium shit ton of zzz quil some melatonin and I slept for 6 whole fucking hours. THANK FUCKING GOD.

NOW TODAY: either 6-7 days no phenibut I still have slight tremors but no more fucking heart palpitations brain zaps stopped about a day before that vision isn’t blurry yeah maybe some anxiety but fuck it give me fucking anxiety fuck what I just went through and fuck phenibut make that shit illegal. If I had any idea the consequences were so severe I would’ve never bought that little $20 bottle.

First of all I want to thank you all for the support and wish you a happy new year.

I previously made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ebuowg/slowly_clawing_my_way_out_of_this_hell/) where I describe how I have been using pheni daily for 2 years with doses ranging from 4-6 gpd, and started getting withdrawal symptoms while dosing pheni daily. (Interdose withdrawals? Receptor death? Im not sure at this point, but the wd symptoms got milder during my taper).

I took my last dose on friday 27 december 2019, it was 100mg. Since then I have been completely off phenibut.

I slept fine friday night like most of my taper. The withdrawal symptoms started to increase dramatically around saturday night as expected. I got around 3 hours of sleep daily from saturday until wednesday. No real increase in anxiety as I was extreme fatigued and barely functioning. The only other major withdrawal symptom I have experienced is extreme itching and crawing of skin which comes and goes in waves. I slept for a solid 7 hours for the first time last night, but the skin crawling feeling persists.

At this point my anxiety has been increasing a tiny bit but the fatigue and depression are getting better every day. I expect that the last of the withdrawal symptoms will slowly fade over the next couple days. I already feel much better then when I was constistenly dosing around 6gpd.

Ive used the following meds & supplements to aid wd:

* Melatonin 3mg every night.
* Diphenhydramine 50mg (taken only when faced with extreme insomnia)
* Magnesium 500mg every night.

&#x200B;

I want to thank everyone who posts, reads and comments on this sub. Every experience and every bit of advice are invalueable to anyone who is facing dependence and withdrawal. Stay strong everyone.

tl;dr: Fast taper from 6gpd to 0mg because of wd symptoms while dosing. Jump off at 100mg, mild wd symptoms and insomnia.",7,0

I have probably 20g left. Will I have bad wd from this and should I taper and what's a good taper schedule?

I know it won't be as bad as people who have been on it for yrs but I still have to work daily with others and already have social anxiety. 

Thx in advance",1,0
