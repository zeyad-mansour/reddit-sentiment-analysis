To summarize this post: I have since quit phenibut, however several years ago I started taking 3-4G phenibut daily, and shortly after I realized the mental (psychoactive) effect of other drugs wasn’t really working anymore, the longer I took phenibut the less effective they became, until they completely ceased to work altogether. We’re talking stimulants, MDMA, psychedelics, cocaine, you name it. However opioids were the one caveat, they continued to work while on phenibut, but after quitting I can only partially feel the physical effect of them now. However benzos still work like normal.

Here is my question: If there is anyone here that is quit knowledgeable regarding the functionality / necessity of glutamate (Or GABA-B) in relation to the efficacy of psychoactive drugs can you please read my insanely long post and give me your feedback based on my situation? I’d HIGHLY appreciate your thoughts.

I feel it’s also important to note that despite the way this post may come across, I’ve only ever done other recreational drugs a handful of times. My issue is not due to *general* drug abuse, but specific drug abuse. All drugs worked perfectly normal prior to phenibut. I am not posting this because I am frustrated that drugs do not work anymore, but rather ever since quitting phenibut I haven’t felt right, and I believe the reason for that is the same reason for why drugs do not work anymore.

I’ll just preface this by stating that I have done hundreds of hours of research into the GABA system, glutamate, GABA-B, and VGCC’s in attempt to understand how this occurred to me, so I am quite versed on this topic.

So here’s my story: I first noticed something was weird after taking MDMA about 2 months after taking phenibut daily. It was extremely weak, but at this time it did have a very mild euphoric effect. I just tossed it up as odd and didn’t think much of it.

However, a few months later I took some adderall and it did absolutely NOTHING, and adderall used to be my favorite drug. It didn’t matter how much I took, there was no effect. It just made me feel fatigued and gave me mild brain fog (which was weird)

The only caveat to this is opioids. I was dependent on kratom prior to taking phenibut. Just 12G a day, and it continued to work like normal along with other opiates **while** taking phenibut. However, oddly enough opioids would not work whatsoever if I was in phenibut withdrawal or after quitting phenibut.

Here’s my phenibut / kratom timeline:

* 1/1/2016: Started taking 8-12G kratom
* 1/1/2017: Started taking 3G-4G phenibut alongside kratom.
* 4/1/2019: Cold turkeyed kratom.
* 4/1/2019: Started tapering phenibut
* 4/1/2020: relapsed on kratom, swapped to suboxone immediately
* 6/1/2020: Finally tapered to 400MG phenibut daily. Then quit phenibut.
* 6/1/2020: Starting taking 5MG baclofen daily
* 1/1/2021: Quit baclofen
* 1/1/2021: Got on 600MG gabapentin, started tapering
* Current: 150-200MG gabapentin daily / 2MG subutex.

However after quitting phenibut opiates don’t produce any mental effect now either. To further my point here, a while ago I had to go under for surgery, I went 4 days without any subs prior to major surgery, and they gave me IV fentanyl in the hospital and freaked out when they realized I didn’t notice it. I do feel some extent of the physical effects though, so thankfully the drug still partially worked for it’s purpose during surgery, but they had to use a lot more benzos.

An interesting aspect of that is that I don’t really get any mental WD from suboxone, it’s almost 100% just physical withdrawals. I assume this is because the drug isn’t giving me any mental effect to withdrawal from.

As of today, if I were to take another drug (IE adderall) I’ll feel an *extremely* subtle effect, maybe a ounce of dopamine, and a slight feeling of wakefulness. It’s so subtle that you could hardly know you took anything. So drugs do give off *some* kind of extremely miniscule effect now whereas they didn’t before. 

For those who don’t know, phenibut works by agonising the gaba-B receptor, and inhibiting glutamate by blocking VGCC’s. From my research it appears there is significant evidence to suggest that glutamate is extremely important for neurotransmission, and the GABA-B receptor seems to play a similar role as well.

My theory is that my glutamate system is severely disrupted, and you would think 150-200MG of gabapentin is so insignificant that I should have recovered by now, however I’m starting to strongly believe that the suboxone is causing me to not recover as opioids also significantly inhibit glutamate in a similar way, and I felt almost like my old self before I relapsed back on opioids during my phenibut taper. Again, opioids still effect me, just only physically, and a lot of the physical effects are due to inhibition of glutamate. It’s why gabapentin is so widely recommended for opiate withdrawal. 

Here’s a source that talks about glutamate in regards to neurotransmission / recreational drugs that would somewhat support my theory. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633516/

So is there anyone reading this post that is knowledgeable on this subject that can provide me with your feedback? If so, does my understanding make sense? Can you further elaborate why this occurred? What steps I could do to fix this?

Thanks!!

TL:DR: No psychoactive drugs have **any** effect on me anymore. This started occurring shortly after taking 3G of phenibut daily back in 2017. I have since quit, and currently take 150MG of gabapentin (a micro dose) but drugs still don’t work. I believe it’s due to severe glutamate inhibition / dysfunction from using phenibut for so long, so I’m curious if anyone has any more information to help me understand this neurochemistry as I’m desperate to understand what caused this phenomenon to occur.",5

If I don't jump, I'm prolly gonna go down by .1g every week, maybe every two. However the urge to dose higher is strong. Did it the other day for the first time in months and the high was great.

Its been 2 months since i’ve been off phenibut. I was also taking other drugs like pyrazolam and propranolol and have since stopped them as well. All of these drugs I never took more than once a week but I ended up with some severe withdrawal anyway.

I was hoping someone here can provide some guidance. I am having some severe paws after the cessation. Still having moderate-high anxiety, muscle spasms, trouble sleeping, muscle pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and a bit of dissociation. At this point, its still very severe and I been to the hospital and they keep saying nothing is wrong. 

At this point I am desperate and was thinking about going on a small dose for a proper taper. I did CT these drugs so maybe this is the better way to go to avoid paws? Can anyone advise a dose? Or should I just wait it out and things will get better?

Symptoms seem to be intense after eating and if I exercise a few days in a row.

Edit: just for clarification, max dosing was about 2.5-3g once a week. Something else I was taking, must’ve caused cross tolerance and caused severe withdrawal.",3

People that know I take it can tell immediately cause they say I just have a different aura when I’m on it and that my body language isn’t so closed off.

I’ve been tapering for several months now and it has been a long process and in the beginning it was a very painful process. Ended up in the care of physicians (ER, urgent care, GP) several times due to panic before I finally was able to get the taper under control and reduce at a reasonable and slow pace. I started at about 3-4gpd and was also dependent on 600mg pregabalin at the time. I tapered the pregabalin first because that was quite difficult for me. I used agmatine and NAC as the many people here suggested. Also tried to get baclofen at some point, but it takes a very long time, and was not available to me until recently. 

Well I have been under 300mg since Sunday (today is Wednesday) and yesterday had only one dose of 70mg in the morning, so in 30 minutes I will have gone 24 hours without it. I planned to have an evening dose too but forgot until bedtime and felt totally on anyway. I guess many people jump when they get under 300mg, so I decided to give it a shot. This morning while browsing Reddit I read a few OD stories (not phenibut) but noticed I felt some anxiety after that. I’m trying to distract myself and get through the day today, then I think it should be easier. I’m telling myself that I’m ok, and if I do have any anxiety today it is just anxiety, and it won’t hurt me. 

I’m going to try to get some exercise this afternoon, and spend time doing my hobbies and making a healthy dinner tonight. If I can’t shake the anxiety (especially physical symptoms like sweaty palms) maybe I’ll have 0.25 baclofen, but I’ll try to avoid it. 

Wish me luck please everyone! Also if anyone else had experience jumping my last 4 days were like 350mg, 280mg, 220mg, 70mg. At these dosages anxiety should be just anxiety and not dangerous, right? Let me know what helped you in the first few days after jumping (lifestyle tips, supplements, anxiety management, etc)

Thanks in advance for your advice/experiences and I hope all of you are doing well too!

Update: I kept the baclofen with me all day but did not end up needing it. It’s been well over 48 hours now and I have no anxiety at all. My next steps are working on steps to repair my ability to naturally motivate myself. Exercise, good nutrition, some sun exposure, socialization, and slowly building up my time spent on cognitively demanding tasks. If anybody else felt demotivated or anhedonic after quitting, tips for healing that and longer term post acute recovery would be welcome as well. It just feels great to know I don’t need it anymore, and I’m sure all of you will be here soon!",13

I know Phenibut is good when used properly but I just want off it. It's really hard quitting benzos and this at the same time. Faso was a miracle and wish it stuck with me a little longer.
 Have I tapered too quickly? What are my chances without Faso that I can stay at one dose and taper slower without lots of depression? Is this as gentle as it gets as somebody with depression on their best days I could use some hope please. Should have known it was too easy.

If you read this and reply thank you so much.",3

I started dabbling with a mix. 2 or 3 grams a day with a giant scoop of the f. And once again at night. I was nodding out pretty nice so I loved it for awhile. 

When the f ran out the regular phen wasn't hitting the same. I was taking 3 grams night and day and still feeling weird. I started tapering, smaller and smaller and less amount of scoops. I weighed my heaping scoop at about .850mg give or take.

I dropped down to two heaping scoops x2 a day.  About two days ago. It's just catching up with me today. I'm super edgy, I know it can be worse so I am gonna ride it out and get off this stuff. 

I've been depressed majorly since starting to taper.  Missing all my college classes since last Tuesday. Isolating/hiding, avoiding major responsibilities. This shit is a nightmare, plus to make things worse the hot water is off and there's no maintenance guy anymore to chamge a breaker, my place is a mess, my hygiene is bad. I just want a hot shower. 

What can I buy to lesson the anxiety that won't prolong my wd symptoms. I can't take anything that will cause me to fail a 9 panel gcms urinalysis. So benzos are out, idk about bclofen and the other gabbaergics and urinalysis. I've read agmatine? What could or should I expect from that? What else is there?  Desperate here.

I don't think etizolam actually will cause you to fail a 9 panel so I might order some of that. I don't think they look for thienzodiazapine. Or some of the more obscure rc benzoyl but it's a gamble with my drivers license so idk. I have ltheanine and 5htp but it does very little to help.",2

**17 second info about me:**

my names mike and im 27 years old

I've taken phenibut since 2016 and when I first took it consistently was all of 2017, taking about 5-6 grams per day for 6+ months straight every single day:

I quit, cold turkey, and was fine -- yes, fine -- legit (meaning my anxiety at most was just discomfort, not even as bad as when I normally get really anxious)

(note: at this time, I was not prescribed or taking klonopin or any benzo's or drinking/no ""GABA"" shit you could say, just kratom (and caffeine))

**1.5 mins  background info:**

I've come off of heroin cold turkey before and have tried coming off of klonopin two winters in a row (2019 and 2020) and was successfully off of the klonopin AS WELL AS adderall, trazodone, phenibut, and caffeine -- and came off of all of that within 5 weeks -- however used kratom daily to help me through it (this is for both 2019 and 2020)

I dropped the adderall, caffeine and trazodone cold turkey

I tapered the phenibut 6g to 0g in 6 days

I tapered the klonopin following a taper chart I found online (actual medical study not random google thing)

\---

I stayed off everything for 3 months the first time, 4 months the second time/year (so only taking literally kratom those months, not even coffee)

The only thing that messed with me was the klonopin-- I never felt like I ""recovered"" and trying to do anything was mad hard

My mom would drive me to get lunch and be out in public daily, my dad walked with me at the park, I worked out a ton at home and I was mostly otherwise watching movies and eating lots of food (but was ripped). I didn't hangout with anyone, I was too anxious to see friends

Both winters doing ""klonopin withdraw"" (although really I just came off everything), I went back on cause I wanted to just live life again and after 3 months and then 4 months the first/second year, I went back on the klonopin and was myself again (this is how it felt) and then added in the other stuff again, minus/plus some other meds

\----

What I've done since 2020 with phenibut:

I've came off phenibut, taking 10+ grams per day, cold turkey, about 3-4 times the past two years with no issue

Obviously the 1.5mg per day of klonopin I'm prescribed (im scripted 2mg a day but I lowered my dose the last year) is helping with that--

\--well, that is, up until recently, recently being August 2021 through today, right now, so 7 months

There is a ton of life stuff that is going on which I think (know) is adding to this, but I cannot come off the phenibut cold turkey for the first time ever without getting mad anxious

I also have tried tapering it down but that sucks I hate tapering I like just getting it done with

I have 6+ years with phenibut, all different kinds, phenibut HCL, phenibut FAA and recently tried F-Phenibut (strong...) (note: that was a week ago, I've tried coming off phenibut before taking F-Phenibut and haven't the last 7 months)

\---

I also have moved out of my family's house because ""unhealthy situation"" living with them (that is a huge understatement, as in huge understatement), I have my own apartment it's mad nice and $2k/month which ive always paid for apts -- has a huge gym etc everything

\---

I dont work, I have money saved up and am currently in school online at Capella University for business, im finishing classes mad quick, Im mad smart

\----

Basically I'm like you except I just dont really go on the internet.

\---

But, I need some positive reinforcement right now. I know reddit has like a forum type vibe to it but not really, and idk people on here, but I don't have any friends I have my girl but I need some help this time around -- some **positive reinforcement**

\---

I've came off on and phenibut dozens of times over the years too, cold turkey, but right now would help having people who ""get it"", who've taken phenibut, to just push me through the next week

&#x200B;

It's my actions, but coming back on here and (hopefully) seeing positive reinforcement would help a ton

  
If you've read this far, thank you and I hope you comment below. Like I said in the title, not looking for advice (humbly speaking), since I know this area and have done this a ton, but rather for positive reinforcement. I know what I need and that is why I'm being direct so that I don't waste your time or mine

Thank you in advance

If you haven't been following my journey thread, 4 Years 7.5GPD Taper To Sobriety Journey, check it out. I just received my scale from Amazon in the mail yesterday, and I've been way off on my dosages the whole time.

I thought the orange scoop from Liftmode was 500mg depending on how close you got to filling it exactly, and for about 4 years I was taking 3 doses of 5 scoops pd, so I figured I was taking 7.5gpd. When I thought I was running out of Phenibut because of the supply issue, before I was able to get more a couple weeks ago, I dropped down to one dose of 5 scoops which I thought was 2.5gpd. I used a scale for the first time this morning, and when I eyeballed the 5 scoops I've been taking, it only weighed out just over 1.5g, I couldn't believe it. That's really exciting because I wasn't as bad off as I thought I was originally, and I cut another 100mg so I'm officially at 1.4g which is way more progress than I thought I was even at.

I started taking tianeptine/phenibut caps that you buy at the gas stations/head shops locally. They took care of the sub withdrawals and I kinda enjoyed the phenibut side of it. Had never taken any previously. The dumbest part of taking the capsules is I have zero clue how much tianeptine or phenibut is in them. 

So now it’s been a month of taking 15 capsules a day, all in one dose. I got my subs back this past week and have switched back over. I was definitely in withdrawal from the tianeptine but so far I can’t really tell that I’m having any withdrawal symptoms from the phenibut (~48 hours in). 

I wish I could say the exact amount I was taking of the phenibut but I wouldn’t even know where to guess. 

My question is, would I know at 48 hours if the phenibut withdrawal is going to be something I need to worry about? The subs have stopped the tianeptine withdrawal but now I’m kinda worried about the phenibut side of things. 

I know I’m not giving y’all much to work with here but it couldn’t have been a super high dose in those caps, I don’t think. It was a month of 15 caps a day. Any insight is greatly appreciated",5

1g
900mg

1.1g
1.3g went back up because of social events.
800mg got agmatine and NAC thanks to this sub
600mg
500mg
400mg
300mg

I'm planning to go 200 100 and then stop. Or if needed, stay at low dose for a while to give time to my brain before stopping..

So today I'm at 300mg. So far no withdrawals other than some nightmares and sometimes waking up at night a bit stressed with bad thoughts. I also take CBD eat healthy and stay active. 3g of agmatine in 3 doses and 3x NAC 600mg each dose. 

As I am approaching the end, I'm a bit scared of what to expect now. I would like to have some advice. I like to know what to expect as when shit hit the fan I know its expected.

Background : I've used phenibut for 5 years at 1x or 2x a week max with high dosage : 6g. Once I took 6g 2 days in a row and had bad withdrawals couldn't sleep for a week. So that's why I'm super cautious.

It felt like it just totally depressed my body, breathing and all.

Woke up this morning, had some surges, shallow breathing/panic attacks and figured it couldn't have been the Agmatine. So I took another one and now it has done the same exact thing.
I used Agmatine to successfully taper down and it worked well.

I've been using it for maybe 1.5-2 years, and a lot of it almost every day. For example last night I took about 4-5 grams of phenibut hcl, the night before 2-3 grams, and at least 6 grams on 2/14. I usually take it with vodka too. It seems like it usually takes about 2 days before I start having withdrawals, but I'm not really sure honestly.

Terrible rls, sometimes nausea in the mornings causing me to puke. The list goes on. But dosing isn’t really helping. I even did an extra dose during one of these panic attacks yesterday and it made it worse! I’m planning on starting my taper this week when a new order comes. But if this mood swing shit doesn’t stop I’m VERY VERY convinced I’m going to hurt myself. I’ve even ordered some methods during one of these panic attacks.

2022-02-15 09:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/st4oo3/vitamin_b6/,Vitamin B6,"Funny story.

I normally wake up in the morning with what I thought was glutamate problems, the vibration in the limbs stuff. Well, last night I accidently took 10mg of vitamin B6 bc I didnt know 1mg was in each of these dollar store melatonin 3mg pills I got in a hurry bc I was out. I normally take 3 of the 10mg ones so I took 10 of these before I read the back of the bottle.

1mg is 60% of your daily recommended intake so I freaked at first which made me read up on it. That's when I was relieved to see some people take 100mg. A 10mg supplement of B6 is a common thing, some are alot more.

Anyway, when I woke up this morning, I had none of the usual going on and was like wtf is this? I didnt connect it to the B6 at first until I read about the symptoms of deficiency. It causes neuropathy, tingling and prickling of the limbs, potentially seizures in severe cases, depression and anxiety. Plays a role in neuro transmitters like gaba and dopamine.

Hmm. Now, alcoholism can be a cause and also poor diet, but regardless I find it insane that 10mg of B6 one time could cause such a drastic effect. This isnt placebo, something is definitely different. This has been an everyday thing forever.

Just a word to consider but so quickly we always chalk up everything bad we might be experiencing to tapering phenibut, caused by it, something to do with it. I see it so often with people making posts mentioning all of this shit they're on but its phenibut thats causing their problem. Rather mind blown here and I'm well aware of placebo but this is too real to be that. Anyways, have a good day.",4

for some context: I used to take 3-4G of phenibut every day for 2+ years. I quit over a year ago and have since recovered.

In the beginning phenibut was subtle, but after 1-2 months it started to become unbelievably potent. It almost seemed like the longer I took it, the better it worked. However, that wasn’t the case.

I also did not develop any dependence to phenibut for 1+ years, and it never lost its effectiveness. I was a complete anomaly. Phenibut completely changed my life, and I mean *completely*

Here’s the catch, and why I believe phenibut worked for me the way it did.

About 2 weeks after I started taking phenibut I started working out at the gym, and when I mean working out, I mean it. I’m talking 5+ times a week doing 8+ high weight exercises consistently. I gained over 30 LB’s of muscle in 1 year.

Here’s another interesting thing, phenibut continued to keep working at the same dose up until the time frame that I stopped working out. I got injured and had to stop, and after about 1 month out of the gym, suddenly phenibut stopped working and I had to quit, but my withdrawals were nothing like others. I didn’t have the typical GABA / Glutamate withdrawals, but rather dopamine from downstream GABA-B effects.

I didn’t put this all together until recently when I thought back on my recovery from phenibut, and realized I only started recovering after I finally went back to the gym, so out of curiosity I googled “Working out glutamate” - And sure enough there’s dozens of studies citing that working out specifically tells the brain to regulate glutamate and GABA production / levels, and there’s mountains of evidence suggesting that working intensively is the quickest and fastest route to recover from drugs as all drugs imbalance glutamate levels (especially phenibut) and glutamate is the core neurotransmitter that influences all other neurotransmitters. So while phenibut was actively trying to screw up my GABA and glutamate levels, the gym was fighting back keeping them in check, and I believe that’s why phenibut continued to work without increasing the dose, and why I didn’t have the typical withdrawals that every one else has.

So essentially, if you want to recover as fast as possible, you should go to the gym and do high intensity workouts. In the beginning your going to hate it, but after about 2-3 weeks of consistently going, you’ll start to feel amazing, almost like a phenibut high in itself.",6

Then drop 250mg

Thurs 750mg
Fri 750 mg

I've worked out that I'll be off phenibut for 2 days and then I'll fly. 5 days in Italy and then fly back.

I've just got some NAC (600mg). Unsure of the dosages, but I assume 2 caps in the morning and 2 in the afternoon should be OK? 

Also, got some ashwagandha, agmatine, cbd gummies, but I take those daily anyway

Oh and some sleep supplements with melotonin, gaba and magnesium

I've also got some green kratom, but it never seems to work at low doses, and if I take a high does it feels like death. I also enjoy taking a shit on a day to day basis, so the constipation side effect isn't that appealing

Somehow i made it tough the storm and now I'm on just methadone.

Anyways the past 2 months I played with phenibut a total of 5 times. 3 of those times were just anxiety ridden and were no so bad to get through. 2 of those times sent me into psychosis for longer than a day. I'm 30 years old and have never suffered from bouts of psychosis other than a couple of times tweaking. I was literally either laying in a fatal position or sitting up Indian style with my head facing down chanting mantras over and over such as ""I hate myself"" or ""what am i going to do."" Now i only remember bits and pieces but my fiancee witnessed the entire thing. I was so confused, anxious, and i felt like i was lost. She ended up taking me to the ER bc she was scared i had a stroke and they sent me back home and said it was just anxiety.

Do not go cold turkey. Please taper. It will save your life.

I had a run going for about 7 months, taking about 9-10 grams nightly after about 4 months of taking 4-6 grams every night. Phenibut in all honesty gave me some of the best sleep since I could remember. and gave me energy in the morning to work in the hot sun without feeling fatigued. I was very aware of the nightmare situations that have occurred with users going cold turkey. My girlfriend who has also read up on the withdrawal effects encouraged me to quit, but to taper. Me being the ignorant asshole I was, I decided to just give myself the 72 hours cold turkey and see how I felt at the end. 72 hours later, I was only having a bit of insomnia and small ""head jerks"" as I can describe them. It is now 14 days in, and I am just feeling average as I used to feel with the use of paxil before starting my use of phenibut. I am back to using hydroxyzine for sleep.

Let me also clarify, that I don't use any drugs anymore, since I have been with my girlfriend of 2 years who ended up in treatment for benzo abuse 11 months ago. But even before my usage of phenibut, I was a usual user of DMT, weed, shrooms, etc... but have never experienced any withdrawal effects like she has.

*It will be updated to provide accurate assistance over the months and years to people who feel its time to move on and away from this drug/medicine.*

Its long, but helpful I hope (especially if other people contribute in the comments for people seeking answers to read through)

This post is basically for two purposes - primarily it's for those who are tapering who wish to see a working progress from beginning to end & secondly, its to initiate a discussion about all the positive and negative effects we can directly attribute to long term medium to high dosage daily Phenibut use - say 2g upwards over around 6months or more as an estimate.

My own usage was stable at 6g x2doses a day - since May 21' - so 9 months - and occasionally rose to 8/9gpd on rare occasions x3doses a day. Currently I am tapering at 0.05g each dose totalling 0.1g per day and am at 3.4g today

I will update and edit this post throughout and long after the taper (until I feel there are no after effects) for those who need the information and begin their own taper.

**Positives:** 

Usage assisted me in quitting alcohol, which had become an issue due to anxiety and depression (which almost got me), plus a myriad of mental health issues which left me isolated indoors, eventually jobless, friendless, and needing an escape. Think gambling, drugs, drink and a couple of arrests for mixing with benzos and dossing around a town in Spain out of my nut - though calmly (not angrily or being a nightmare). Out of control, but mostly my head was a horrendous place to exist in.

Phenibut enabled me to remove the limitation of anxiety + lift my mood. As opposed to the sertraline I was taking as well as previous usage of Wellbutrin/Bupropion and ketazolam/benzos for anxiety and depression. They helped a small amount, but the Phenibut really did enable me to get up and deal with things face on.

It enabled me to write, overcome my fear and start a small publishing business plus move into a freelance tutoring career. I feel completely assured of my ability to continue in this fashion upon cessation as I was already on my way out of the hole before Phenibut use. It just sped up the pace of my progress x10 as an estimate.

Sleep ahs been the best I've ever had in my life since using it and I expect that to be okay as the lifestyle implementations I have made are things I hadn't managed to create without the use of this drug.

I would say Phenibut usage lent me a ladder that enabled me to climb out of a deep decade long hole and now that I'm tapering I'm pulling the ladder of Phenibut up and putting away for good. 

**Negatives:**

With higher doses above 6g I found I couldn't sleep and at 9g I went into full blown dissociation or psychosis for a day. I slept over ten days about 20mins every 4-5hrs like an uberman sleep schedule and then lost my mind for a short while, not dangerously, just temporarily dissociated. I stabilised at 6g x2 per say after that and did taper down once to 1.5g a day, but wasn't ready to quit then, like now. Because it didn't really have an effect at that dose. 

Another negative was when I initially used it I would wake up breathless and nod off out of nowhere. It didn't worry me as such as this disappeared within a week or two. However, there are occasions (that I've only recently pinpointed) when I take my second dose that I feel a small shortage of breath. 

Phenibut has also caused at times some terrible neck pain and postural issues which seem to have been elevated from their previous achy state (only when held in bad posture for too long) I would say that Phenibut allowed me to maintain a terrible posture without pain and thus after lowering the dosage I began to get some payback. This was easily overcome with 2 weeks of neck exercises and some stretching (lifestyle changes)

I think Phenibut has some impact on the nerves in the lower legs and arms. As if sometimes there is a neuropathy or loss of feeling and weakness in the limbs. Nothing dramatic, though quite annoying at times, a definite effect. I've seen a neurologist and this is likely to heal itself as nerves take between 1-3months to repair after damage (the body is an amazing self repairing machine - such a magnificent container for whatever we are - if you see the world that way)

Increased health anxiety due to symptoms such as breathing and nerve inflammation. These things can point to a myriad of medical issues. However, I had a thorough physical with an EKG and blood, urine, lungs, eyes, ears - a total MOT. I'm in great shape at 38. 

I had an experience with cold turkey due to a delivery error. DO NOT COLD TURKEY. Hell awaits you, sleepless, painful, body tremoring aching burning sore ill horror show, and you are not strong enough and you should not damage yourself long term. I had one day of zero intake after a massive reduction for two days and it hit me around 72hrs in. Nothing close to diazepam in my experience. Zoloft and ketazolam was like quitting coffee in contrast, on reflection. Taper...Taper...Taper!

**Supplements used + Lifestyle changes:**

I decided to make extreme changes before Christmas and implement all the things I said I would but only ever went about 20% in on my targets. 

However I'm 100% in on my targets for the past 6 weeks and feel this will benefit others who need to begin with tapering and lifestyle changes (this is accumulated knowledge from the excellent people and resources of quitting Phenibut on reddit - the reason I am making this post and will update it throughout)

Vitamin C - around 5 to 10g a day (its not toxic) mixed in a drink (I had what seemed to be glands out flu developing, it came, my immune system saw and it conquered in 2 days - fucking incredible)

Magnesium high doses PLUS Magnesium Glycinate for bedtime

NAC - currently at 400mg but plan to titrate upwards (at 3.4g I can feel some mild tremors but it isn't worrisome and hey, I'm healthy, the body is amazing and the brain will attain homeostasis eventually - someone wise on here said to me easy is smooth and smooth is fast in regards to tapering)

Vitamin B complex - high potency

Vitamin D3 every few days 10,000ug

Selenium 200ug 

Iodine in my Vit. C drink

Omega 3 450mg I think (Spanish label and I'm not the best with it)

Zinc 50mg

I put the Vit. C with NAC and iodine in a drink with a small flavouring and drink with a meal and vitamin tablets - in between Phenibut doses.

...

Dietary changes - OMAD one meal a day, eating primarily fish, beef, eggs and cheese with coffees (limited) and tea with milk with reducing sugar amounts - a taper of its own. Some chamomile and other strange teas the girlfriend buys. Plus bananas x2 a day as this is a replacement potassium level as I feel the issues of nerves and breathing may be related to potassium deficiencies (I will update on this over time - however my medical showed no bad markers for this.

Basically a carnivore elimination diet which reduces inflammation - experience from before and I have personal experience it works for me. Mind and body. This time is 90 days elimination and food tolerance tests each month until I know what is and isn't right for my body and mind.

Water - I have increased my water intake purposefully as I feel my self dried out internally (probably from all the terribly loose stools I've had during the past 6months), Maybe 2litres a day on top of all the teas, milk, vitamin drinks etc. so double that to 4litres total (enough to constantly need to piss as a consequence)

Exercise - lift medium weights (due to nerve issues meaning I take it easier) x4 days per week (upper/lower split). 1hr stretch x3 days a week (feels great). Outside running in the evening sunshine here in Spain x3 times a week increasing distances slowly. I even do facial exercises and eye rolls due to dry eyes, which I believe is due to dehydration possibly, oil gland has closed according to my optician, but a hot towel over the eyes eases it and a hefty dose of water. 

Lifestyle - Going out more often with my girlfriend. Not to get drunk. In the sun, beach, visiting mountains and castles. Hiking, sunshine and that stuff. No drugs (except the taper). no alcohol, no medications, no shit food, nothing from a previous life. No stimulants, kratom, benzos and all that stuff. Hard changes - but things I always wanted to do before Phenibut - but now I am and will continue to do so

...

I hope this helps people and please tell me your story so people can refer to this post as it's updated for a full and comprehensive idea of what it is like to get off this stuff and the changes we should make as to why we started it initially. I think we all want the best for one another on this forum so good luck!

Ps - what health affects have you experienced that you can attribute to Phenibut in all probability - this would really help those who suffer from health anxiety as a means to satisfy that nagging doubt it gives when side effects do occur.",10

I went to the hospital because phenibut turned on me and I started to have paradoxical effects.  On average I think I took around 4 or 5 grams per day.

I took handful after handful of phenibut pills trying to get out of withdrawal and eventually went to the hospital.  3 days later, I leave the hospital with a prescription for baclofen.

I was doing very well after that.  The baclofen was working, I was functional, feeling good, going to work etc.  After a week though, I got hit with agonizing withdrawals.  I would take phenibut, which at a low dose (under a gram) which would make me feel a little better, but if I took more, I would just start toxifying myself again.

I'm currently in the ER taking 5mg baclofen every 7 or 8 hours and I feel a little more normal, but Im really worried that I'm going to go back into withdrawal in a week

Can phenibut stay in your system for 7 days?  Is that why I keep going into withdrawal, or was I taking too much baclofen and I'm getting paradoxical effects?  FYI before going to the ER I was taking 20-30 mg every 3 or 4 hours.  I'm very confused.",5

Took 2 seperate 1 month long breaks, and never experienced any marked side effects. Last time I took it though, I was left with severe anhedonia / emotional numbness 2 days after dosing, at a dose of merely 850mg. Chalked it up to a bad rebound, but the effects persist even after 1.5 months now. Only took it once since at a lower dose, again with no side effects. Something like this would only occur with someone who experiences withdrawal, which shouldn't be the case for me.

I've suffered from DPDR in the past, and the first week of these 1.5 months had marked DPDR symptoms, along with extreme tiredness and depressed mood. These symptoms have since cleared up and I'm left only with the emotional numbness. 

Interestingly, alcohol causes similar effects, also at low, one-time doses. So either my GABA system is extremely fucked or it's psychological, which wouldn't make too much sense either though.

Maybe someone here experienced something similar. Would it even be possible for Phenibut to suddenly just ""turn bad""?",2

Now I am at 600mg per day and other than anxiety which I have been treating with things like breathwork, cold exposure training and CBD, I haven't had any other withdrawal symptoms but for the past 2 nights, I've had a bit of insomnia. took me forever to get to sleep last night but after a heavy dose of homemade CBD edibles, I managed to get a really good amount of sleep. Tonight I am having difficulty getting to sleep again.

I would like to be done with phenibut and get over the withdrawals as soon as possible while still being safe so I am considering just hopping off after tonight and dealing with the withdrawals (which have been very minor the whole time tapering) so that, even if the withdrawals get worse, I can just work my way through them and then come out on the other side toward healing from this addiction. 


Is this a good idea or no? is it safe to go from 600mg per day to nothing even if I am prepared to deal with the discomfort? I just feel like it hasn't been bad at all these whole past couple of months tapering so I think I could handle it but please give me your advice. 

My biggest concern is sleep. If I am going to experience some insomnia, I'd rather not drag that part out any longer than it needs to. would rather heavily medicate with CBD or whatever else I need to sleep and get through it rather than dragging it out a few more weeks than necessary.

One day phenibut turned on me and sent me in instant withdrawals. 2 months of little sleep, constant anxiety, and no help. I'm now off phenibut and I feel much better.","where do i begin. 

in 2016 I was interested in nootropics.

 my then undiagnosed ADHD me found phenibut and stuck with it - it cured my anxiety, depression and ADHD.

From age 24 to 30, I finished educations, got nice jobs, plenty of friends and I was just crusin. finally my anxiety and ADHD symptoms were under control.. at least while under the influence.

It was very responsible at first. 500mg twice a week.

then 1g twice a week.

then 2g, 3g, and it kinda took off. I was successful at tapering to 0mg sometimes, but often went back to phenibut when social situations and stress became too much.

. But 99% of the time, I was tapering daily, for months. I went to France, Czech Republic and Norway, while taking phenibut and a scale with me. I was constantly tapering, and had ""cheat days"".

Fast forward 6 years - it's 1st December 2021, Christmas is coming up, and family expecting me for Christmas eve.

I had binged 2 weeks on Phenibut. Stress..

Then, one casual morning, my normal dose sent me in full-blown withdrawals. No matter how much I took, I felt an insane amount of anxiety and body vibration. I knew I had fucked up.

I was forced to spend my limited amount of money on ordering more Phenibut (100dollar almost for 100g). I tried my best to taper, but no matter what I was thrown into insane glutamate surges and anxiety. 0 sleep. 

i knew I fucked up when I realized I can't go to work like this. I had to resign my work as social worker - my colleagues were stunned at my sudden disappearence. And i cut contact with my family.

What followed was even crazier.. I knew I had to get help, FAST. I had to get baclofen. The Reddit source doesn't ship to Denmark, and shady Indian WhatsApp vendors would take 1-2 months to arrive. if they ever got past customs.

I knew I was fuckdd. I contacted a rehab, who called me in for interviews and had no fucking clue what phenibut was. **I was patient zero**.

They wanted me to go to intensive ER. During Corona times. Despite my complaints that I simply needed baclofen, the psychiatrist wouldn't budge. I was to go to the hospital for Detoxing off of GHB, in ER. fuck

I tried my best (documents and everything) to tell the staff at the hospital that giving me benzos Wont work. They didn't listen and I gave up trying to convince them. I let them sedate me with benzos for 24h, got released with 5 benzo pills the next 3 days.

I was still withdrawing, and returned home to continue my taper.

It didn't take long for me to realize I was still FUCKED. No sleep, constant anxiety.. I called the Poison Control line. I told them I had ingested a legal product and was in withdrawals. They referred me to my general practitioner.

I called my doctor's office. Got told to drink plenty of water. I hung up, I was NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY..

I don't remember what happened next, but I called the emergency line at my doctor's. I was being very pushy and adamant - hospital didn't help me, my rehab won't help me, I NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR RIGHT NOW.

I then get to see my lifelong doctor, who I had as a teen. I explain everything. I show the documents. I tell him of Baclofen. He's stunned, but I'm sure my frantic, emotional, totally sporadic out-of-it behavior meant this was seirous. I don't know if it was because I was a client for a long time, but he heard my pleas.

He had a direct line to a doctor in pharmacology (PhD master shit)  at one of Copenhagen's hospitals. He was willing to switch my 6gpd to 60mg Baclofen switch. With a RAPID taper. I was to be off of everything in 2 weeks. Fast reduction of baclofen.

OK - i acceptered it, despite voicing concerns over the fast taper. My doctor said his hands were tied. Ok fine

The next 2 weeks I met up at my doctors office everyday at 9am to pick up my daily baclofen. It was excruciating, full of side effects , but i was sticking through it as I knew that this was the only way.

2 painful weeks went by and I was now down to 0 Phenibut and 0 Baclofen.

The anhedonia, lethargy, fatigue, anxiety, muscle tremors and depression set in the next 2 weeks. I tried my best to supplement with whatever I could to survive.

Now, it's been 2 weeks since then and I'm getting better. I'm almost baseline. I can't believe what I been through. But I'm **FUCKING HAPPY** Im off phenibut and can now focus on my self.

Now, I'm in an anxiety treatment program. Getting ADHD medicine. I am on welfare, and receiving help from the public. My life was turned upside down. I now am building myself up from scratch. I got 3 months of sick leave, and am to apply for jobs soon, while also working on my self, sober living, excercise, meditation, healthy diet and looking forward for a life without Phenibut.

I will say one crazy thing - I'm happy all this happened.

In retrospect, I was self medicating and treating myself for my undiagnosed mental health problems. 

And finally, I'm getting the help I so dearly was looking for. Doctors, nurses, psychiatrist, public programs and a optimistic mind has given me a new perspective. If I never got addicted to Phenibut, I might've never gotten the help I needed.

While I'm still dealing with some residual anxiety, I can now sleep, eat, drink and socialize normally. With medicine and therapy I should bounce back soon.

Thank you for reading my post. To all of you in a similar boat., you WILL return to normal. Much love.

**I want to use this opportunity/thread to openly criticize the Danish/western mental health care. I could've gotten help earlier, and I didn't have to suffer through a rapid tapering.

Hi,

(First of all, excuse my English, I live in Belgium)

I've been using phenibut daily for the last 6 months. I started one week after i got into rehab due to heavy alcohol abuse (got hospitalised many times - even to the point of resuscitation - just to say that my addiction was pretty bad).

Sooo...my usage

I take phenibut HCL in powder form. The first few days I started with 5 grams (give or take) but after the first week I was already taking between 20-25 grams a day... and here we are 6 months later. I'm also taking antidepressants which I’ll list below. Furthermore, I'm also taking modafinil (200 mg) or Armodafinil (150 mg) off-label every morning for mental alertness.

**Medication list:**

Effexor (antidepressant)

Wellbutrin (for ADD, also an antidepressant- started 3 weeks ago)

Diovan (to lower blood pressure)

Pantomet (Just @ the moment for stomach issues)

Seroquel (mood-stabiliser I got prescribed but actually don't take)

**My nootropic stack**:

mucuna pruriens 50% l-DOPA

Lemon balm

Ashwaganda

Alpha GPC

Phenylpiracetam

oxiracetam

Aniracetam

Nefiracetam

Fasoracetam

Kratom (red and white)

Modafinil (off-label)

Armodafinil (off-label)

Melatonin

GABA

And of course, PHENIBUUUUT

The reason I'd like to quit, (even though life is really awesome while on it) is because it's taking its toll mentally and -although to a lesser extend- physically.

*mentally:*

Due to my high dosages, I'm experiencing brain-fog around the 12 mg mark.

Less concentrated @ work (but very sociable and horny which make me even more talkative towards women)

I am always walking around (literally everywhere I go!) with a bottle of water mixed with phen and a sachet of Phenibut to refill. because of this, I'm drinking around 5L a day

Just as with my alcohol addiction, I tend to believe that i cannot function without phen, hence my daily usage from morning until night.

When not taking phen for a couple of hours I get gloomy- but when I consequently re-feed my addiction, I get manic which can get pretty exhausting and scary after a while (especially my depressive state after a few hours of abstinence). I also get very motivated to do stuff in my manic phase (this is also the reason why i'm writing this at 2 am).

*Physically:*

When taking higher dosages (24 gram- and above) I get really nauseous and usually end up vomiting all night. The next day resulting in feeling sick, hungover and not motivated.

Also, when taking higher dosages: I get a really weird trembling sensation inside my body.

I start to daydream a lot and then fall asleep for really short periods without notice (even mid  
 conversation.

Not eating all day and nightly sugar cravings

etc...

So, for those reasons (and more) I'll try to lessen or stop my usage by next week. At the moment I'm thinking of quitting cold turkey but i'll see how that will turn out after a few days.

Are there any suggestion you guys can give me?

I was thinking of Kratom to make everything more bearable.. I don't know? I'm also going to restart Wim Hoff's breathing technique, try to eat healthier and workout.

Let me know if you guys prefer a video update!

After 4 rehabs I was prescribed high doses of gaba pentin. This was about 4 years ago. I was on 3200mg a day. I decided I needed more because I was going through script fast. So I had a few people get scripts and was also taking there’s. When I decided I needed to get off I found phenibut. Not knowing how bad it was. I started taking both but eventually just phenibut. I would take staggering doses anywhere from 2gpd to 7gpd on weekends. A year ago I found out I had stage 3 kidney disease close to dialysis from abusing these substances. I slowed down and got my kidney numbers back up but was still using because i was scared to get off. 

So this December I said I was done with it and baselined at 2 grams over a month I did a taper and am now off. I abused the hell out of gaba drugs but can tell you that when your on the other side it’s not as bad as people say on here. I’m doing cardio and eating healthy and have no problems with anxiety anymore.

Anyone who is tapering and scared remember your the master of your mind. It’s a mental fuck if you let it be. Nac and agmantine are a must. 

Last thing, anyone having trouble sleeping drink chamomile tea then take L-theanine and magnesium. Right before bed take melatonin. I use 10mg. This is this perfect combination to rest then get good sleep. 

Good luck to anyone tapering. Any questions please feel free to message me.",8

Decided I wanted to quit a few days ago. Been microdosing.. use liftmode scoop and dump about 90% of it out then use a small screwdriver to put it in mouth. So i am guessing it’s roughly 200 mg a day or less?

The main symptom is nausea.. no vomiting but just no appetite.

Am I tapering too fast or should I suck it up and hopefully be better by next week?

I have remainder of 125 gram nd and two 40s unopened from liftmode so more than enough for taper. Tossing it once I am through this.",2

what i used:

phenibut
agmatine
lemon balm
ashwagandha
gabapentin

i dropped 300 mg phenibut every 3 or 4 days until reaching 1.8 gpd. i was taking 1g of agmatine in the morning and 1g at night. i would usually take it about an hour after phenibut.
i took 1g of ksm66 ashwagandha every morning and 500mg lemon balm at night. i took the ashwaghanda and lemon throughout the entire taper.

once i got to 1.8gpd of phenibut i switched entirely to gabapentin at 1.6 gpd. i had minor issues after switching but it was absolutely nothing compared to phenibut withdrawal.
just a little tired.

i stayed at 1.6gpd foe 5 days to adjust. i then decreased by 100 mg of gabapentin every 3 days until reaching 400 mg pd. then i stopped taking it with no side effects.

if anyone needs and more info on how i did it please dm.

i did use a mg scale to measure the phenibut and gabapentin.

If I take less then that, I do feel unwell on that second day off, insomnia, anxiety, ANGER.  People at work hate me in that case lol.  I've continued this schedule for probably 2 years, maybe more not entirely unsure.

Phenibut is going out of stock everywhere, and I'm pretty done with this shit to say the least so going to take this as a hint to stop.

What would be the best plan of action?  Continue the same dose but try and space out the time between doses?  Or taper my dose every 3rd day?  I have probably about 25-30 grams left.

I'm not interested in baclofen, as I believe that would drag the process out more.  But heard very good things about agmatine, l-theanine, and taurine oddly.

I know this sounds minimal to most user who have gone through withdrawal, but I seem to experience it pretty hard and become a very sad angry boy lol.  

Any advice on supplements, tapering strategy etc. would be greatly appreciated.",2

As of about a month ago I was a daily user for over 3 years and was at 8-10gpd. When I noticed the supply issues I knew it was finally time to quit like everyone…

Anyways. I first did a big taper down to 5g and that was a big sleep/anxiety struggle for 4-5 days until I realized I needed help and did an online appointment with a psychiatrist who prescribed me to gabapentin, baclofen, and Campral (Acamprosate) to control glutamate. INSTANT RELIEF the day I started taking this stuff and I am at very low doses.

Since I have been cutting 300mg every 5-6 days with virtually no withdrawal symptoms. In fact, my head feels clearer than ever. 

Here’s what I’m doing:
Wake up: 1-200mg gabapentin, 330mg campral, 1000mg agmatine, 600mg NAC, 1200mg fish oil

Lunch time: 1-200mg gabapentin, 330mg campral, 1200mg fish oil

Bed time: 300mg Gabapentin, 330mg campral, 1000mg agmatine, 600mg NAC, 1200mg fish oil

And if I’m feeling any sort of anxiety creeping in I will take 5mg baclofen. In the morning or at lunch. 

Like I always have, I take my biggest dose of Phenibut around 6:30-7pm and the smaller dose when I wake up so they are roughly 12hrs apart

I hope this helps someone because I was afraid of getting hooked on these other meds at first but for now I’m doing just fine maintaining low doses.",3

I feel it’s important to share this information for current users. Yes there is a supply issue with phenibut. On top of that I see people in this sub saying they are not getting the same effects from the same products they’ve been using. This is TRUE! I know this because when I was on phenibut a lot of the products I was taking actually took the phenibut OUT but still had it listed in the ingredients. I even opened capsules and it was not the same as it used to be. I recommended some products recently for people who don’t want to go into sudden withdrawal and one of those products recently removed the phenibut! They still had it listed in the ingredients though. I even purchased and opened the capsules MYSELF and the substance was brown like dirt! It is usually white! So to everyone saying it’s all in someone’s head....ITS NOT! Although your opinion is greatly appreciated. I don’t mean to be rude in any way but I do know company’s are trying to manage the supply shortage and unfortunately that means adding fillers and less phenibut to the products they sell. I was a very experienced user for several years. I even went into withdraw once from a legitimate phenibut source because they tried to add less phenibut and more filler. For those of you experiencing this situation it’s NOT IN YOUR HEAD! Some folks may say that but I’ve been there and it is indeed different! Once again this post isn’t meant to offend anyone or devalue someone’s opinion. I am simply trying to help those of you who are going through unexpected withdrawals and experiencing issues with your products. Best of luck on your journey folks! Wishing you all only the best!,6

I have no issues, just minimal anxiety that L-Theanine wipes out. Only issue now is at night I constant feel like I have to pee which I barely even pee and it doesn’t let me get any sleep. 

Exactly like when I was on Xanax for a year and had to quit for probation purposes. 

I take Doxepin for sleep but that isn’t helping. 

Any suggestions with anyone experiencing this symptom?",1

Obviously no supply so I just decided I needed to quit and have enough to taper. Only have 300mg tablets and for the last 3 days been on 1 tablet per night to help with sleep. Getting maybe 4 or 5 hours of sleep. Any tips on how to go lower? I can feel borderline panic attacks coming at night before I take it. Should I open up a capsule, dump half in a cup and drink that for the night and drink the other half the next night?",5

I’ve ended up in hospital 4 times due to accidentally overdosing and I’m extremely lucky I haven’t killed myself. I’m taking between 2.5g and 7.5g a day. I’ve ordered Baclofen and Agamatine Sulphate.

I only take .65 g daily to ward off any withdrawal symptoms. I haven't actually felt the affects of phen in 2 years. I'm super afraid of quitting as I am terrified of the withdrawal.

I have gone 2 days, multiple times without taking it but the anxiety that came was too much and I would relapse back. 

I'm very scared about the possible super bad side affects that come along with withdrawal, and am looking for some advice on how to stay strong. 

Unfortunately, due to the phen shortage, I don't have enough to do a prolonged taper. I maybe have a little over 1 months supply. 

What can I expect? I've read horror stories about the withdrawal and it has me absolutely mortified about stopping.",1

Anyways, with the whole shortage going on, I got some f-phenibut and for some reason memory is a little foggy but I wanna say I just completely dropped phenibut for maybe 5 days, but it started feeling gross, completely non-euphoric, and then all of the sudden I would wake up with the tingly limbs and be unable to go back to sleep, but not awful. But this was only for a couple weeks at beginning of January.

&#x200B;

To now, I just switched back over to phenibut back 1.5 grams/day ish and bc I'm an idiot I did a 2day no sleep binge on vyvanse and phenibut. I forget my doses but I think it was like probably like 6-7g over 2 day period.

Got maybe 6 hrs sleep monday night b4 work and felt a little more anxious so took closer to 1.9g, and anyways all seemed well last night, went to sleep quick at 12, but woke up to a terrible nightmare at 1:30 with numb arms, anxiety, a progressing headache, tachycardia etc. I was able to take a .4 and sleep for an hrs, but all I could think about was that my BP was causing my vision to get a little blurry, the reason for the headache. Woke up feeling slightly better but thought I was withdrawing bc I didn't know about the glutamate. Took .7 in the morning and felt shitty (vibrations,anxiety) but got scared and feeling shitty after 4 hrs so I did a bunch of smaller .3s and .4s every couple hrs. Anyways, I took a .25 3 hrs ago, and some CBD and supplements, and I was already ready to go to the ER, but 2 hrs later the vibrations stopped completely and are just now coming back, not sure but I think it's better than this morning.

&#x200B;

basically: tl;dr: Is it possible that the ""surge"" was just a one and done rebound from the weekend binge? I was already expecting to be in hell and have to live thru a few more days while lowering my dosage or go to ER for high BP, but I know my dose is pretty small beans compared to some folks here. I'm just scared and need some insight on dose regimen. Think I'm going to try another .3 to go to sleep. And do like .3 every 4 hrs maybe tomorrow versus any big dose.",5

I started taking it when I found it on Amazon very shortly after I had my son. Fast forward 9 years, I have no idea how I got to this high dose, it just happened. I think that when it was working, a little higher felt good. Then I just started taking it to avoid the withdrawal symptoms, I've been on the same dose for years. I bought from an online store until now, when I saw how scarce the supply is. Would some kind soul give me an outline of a tapering schedule with the 800g I have left?  I don't know why the simple task of making a couple of simple outlines has been so difficult for me. I also deal with a lot of anxiety, adhd(inattentive), major depression, so I think it's just been a little overwhelming. I would be extremely grateful for any help, as well as any advice you can give.  I also have gabapentin and some pretty weak benzos. ",9
