I’m getting prepared just incase. I got myself in a mess I was taking 40gpd i cut my dose in half with agmatine then i felt completely find on 20g the next day i cut down to 16.50g... still fine but i hadn’t slept more than 1 hour in 3 days now i’ve been on 16g for 3 days and while i still don’t feel much anxiety or depression i can’t sleep more than an hour at night! Ii don’t feel like i’m withdrawing i just can’t sleep! I have been on phenibut for 3 years. 
I thought after stabilizing at the same dose for 3 days i would get some sleep. I have no idea if i should take gram before bed and see if that works or wth to do i’ve tried melatonin the only thing that has helped is gabapentin but it helps me sleep 2 hours max honestly. Should i stick to this dose for a day or two longer? When I take it in the morning i feel less shakey so i’m guessing if i take another gram i’ll feel the “magic” more and be able to sleep but i’m just confused and trying to stay calm. If i could sleep I would continue the taper normally.

I just basically don’t want to start hallucinating i’m pretty sure the gabapentin will give me at least 2 hours sleep. And continue to try to hold steady at this dose to see if i adjust to it",2,0

Since then I end up going on little phen binges every once in a while when I’m stressed, just like I have been lately. The last 4 days have been pretty shit (high anxiety, paranoia, irritability) but knowing it’s almost over along with kratom, hydroxyzine, and seroquel has made it much more manageable.

Just wanted to share my experience with you guys.

My highest dose was 3grams a day.

The first 2 months I was able to consistently keep the dose at 1-1.5grams a day. Unfortunately, the stuff has so much tolerance that I started taking more to get the same effect.

I went up to 3 grams a day. The side effects became more and more. In the evening I could not sleep well, although it worked great at the beginning to sleep. I constantly had a pressure in my head and lost weight. I have always been a muscular type, so even my friends were scared when I saw them again after a long time.

From then on I knew I had to stop. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of reading all the horror stories here. What has led to the fact that I was terrified to stop. So I started with a quick taper and am now at 700mg. Every day I go down 100mg.

The worst were the withdrawal symptoms when I went down 300-400mg a day. I had bad thoughts, couldn't remember anything at work and was very depressed. The body feeling was the most disgusting at all, I was constantly under stress, especially in the evening it was always very bad and I was very scared. After 2-3 days with very little sleep I feel much better and I have absolutely no withdrawal symptoms since I slowed down with the taper.

I smoke weed in the evening to sleep better. However, I would be very careful with it. Just smoke very slowly and then wait how you feel. I'm just glad to be off this stuff soon, although it has brought me a lot, it has also set me back professionally. Since I was somehow more busy listening to music and surfing the web than doing my job.

Please be careful with phenibut and respect it. Don't get discouraged with the taper even if it gets difficult sometimes. It gets better and better.

supplements i take during tapering.

Shilajit

magnesium glycinate

creatine

NAC

I have around 70 10mg Baclofen tablets. I can order more but I'd need to wait a month for them to arrive. 

My question is, should I immediately switch to 90mg (30mg 3x a day) and taper down or do a fast Phenibut taper with Baclofen? 

For the fast Phenibut/Baclofen taper, I was thinking that I could jump to 8g Phenibut in the morning and take 10mg later in the day. I could lower my Phenibut dose by 500mg every few days and increase my baclofen dose accordingly. Once I've jumped off Phenibut, I'd start my Baclofen taper.

I tried melatonin, gen 1 antihistamines, and weed so far. I was looking around in my medicine cabinet and came across some Benzonatate, a non-psyhoactive cough suppressant which is known to induce drowsiness.

I may have quit in a much more dangerous way than I did, or maybe not have quit at all.

I'm a few weeks phenibut clean from my last relapse. I don't have money to buy more, and I hope I can keep this up when I do.

I feel completely fine","So idk why this would be the case, but I feel mostly normal currently at 52 hours since last dose. I’ve been on 6 gpd for about 5 months. Only symptoms are just being keyed up, slightly raised HR, and of course some trouble falling asleep. Weirdly enough I actually got like 5 hours of sleep from the 40 hr mark to the 45 hr mark. 

This is the third forced CT I’ve had to deal with and I was under the impression that kindling made each WD worse than the last. But other than those mild symptoms, I’ve even been able to laugh and joke with people etc. 

The only things I’ve done differently this time are working out daily for ~2 hrs, and I’ve been supplementing D1-T for a few months, a precursor to testosterone. I also had my dose of Effexor (SNRI) raised a month ago. 

I can’t tell if I just haven’t felt WD yet or if I’m feeling it now and just not really being phased by it. I definitely feel keyed up and anxious but not debilitating primal fear and hearing fucking 2000s pop songs playing in the room next to me at 5 am like the last time; or waking up gasping for air. 

Any time I’m feeling anxious this time I just immediately shut that shit down, like I just think to myself “nah, you can’t fool me, I know you’re just fucking with my perception.” It’s like my resolve has been strengthened.

Frankly it’s kind of suspicious, I’m thinking now that I haven’t REALLY felt WD yet. But at this point idc because my shipment is arriving tomorrow around 4, so I need to make it 20 more hours. We’ll see what happens I guess.

I took 56 grams of Fresh Psilocybe Cunbensis in 2016. I thought it would approximate a dose of 5 dried grams. It did not. It felt like 8+ dried grams. I did the Terence Mackinnon silent darkness method. It cured my addiction overnight. 
            However, I still continued to binge drink. I would drink anywhere from 1-2 gallons of 9% beer every night for a few months, taper down a little bit, grab some clonazepam in case of an emergency and suffer through the withdrawals. I would stay sober a month of two and then start the process again. I tried ordering 200 etizolam pills and that helped a lot. I luckily did not get addicted to the etizolam. 
              I continued my alcohol binge sobriety/cycle for a few years. On my 35th birthday, I was given a 30mg IR Roxi. I took a TINY sliver of the pill and overdosed 20 minutes later. You guessed it,, the pills was chock full of fentanyl. After that, I again stopped all hard drugs. That was two years ago. 
               I found Phenibut in January of 2020. I took it daily from early January to Mid March 2020. I got up to about 6gpd. When the Covid shut down happened, I did a fast taper and felt weird for about 10 days. When stores started to open back up in May 2020, I got back on Phenibut until mid-June 2020. I then did a quick taper that sucked and started to go back to drinking a lot of beer daily (1-2 gallons of 9% beer).  I continued doing this until November. I also started taking about 4gpd of Phenibut in July. 
               I decided I needed to get serious about stopping. I tapered down my drinking to a gallon per day of 9% beer by late December 2020. I also ordered 200 etizolam pills which arrived in January 2021. The pills allowed me to get down to half a gallon of 9% beer by February.
              My 5 year relationship with my girlfriend completely fell apart in late February. I had already ordered another 250 etizolam pills earlier in February and they arrived at the beginning of March. I gave away a lot of the pills and traded a lot of etizolam for real 2mg alprazolam bars and 1mg Clonazepam pills (prescriptions directly from the pharmacy).  I stopped taking all the pills by late March. However, during the last week of March, I discovered I was taking close to 12gpd of Phenibut.  Over the course of a week, I was able to cut down to 7.7gpd. It was incredibly rough and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. I would certainly never attempt it again. I was using about 4gpd of Agmatine as well.
               My last drink was on March 29th. I had an amazing high dose (1,000 micrograms over 24 hours) LSD trip where I smoked a lot of DMT at the peak. I lost my desire to drink right then and there.
                 Around mid March, I ordered again ordered AGMATINE. For me,, I think it took about two weeks of dosing 4gpd to really start having the full effects (one gram per dose of Phenibut (I break my total Phenibut daily intake into 4 doses roughly 6 hours apart)).
                  THIS IS THE PART YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR:
                  On April 17th, 2021, I was able to get green ""xanax"" bars. They are dark web bars. They are supposedly 2mg Alprazolam, 1mg Etizolam, and 0.5-1mg FLUALPRAZOLAM.  *I  DON'T THINK THIS IS TRUE*.  I have had extensive experience with all of the aforementioned substances. I have had years long benzo addictions (via legal prescriptions and illicit sources). The last time I tapered off of benzos was 2012-2013 under a doctor's supervision. I will spare you the details, but it was pretty awful. 
                 Anyway, I can take 1/6 of a green bar and it lasts ALL DAY. Sometimes, I will take another 1/6 of a bar about 2 hours before I go to bed. 
                  I have dropped from 7.7gpd to 5.7gpd in the last week. For example, I will take 1.5g Phenibut+1/6 flualprazolam bar+1g Agmatine....6 hours later 1.4g Phenibut+1g Agmatine....in another 6 hours I will take 1.4g Phenibut+1g Agamatine+POSSIBLY 1/6 bar Flualprazolam...in another 6 hours I will take 1.4g Phenibut+1g Agmatine+POSSIBLY 1/6 bar Flualprazolam IF I DID NOT TAKE THE 1/6 BAR OF FLUALPRAZOLAM WITH ME THIRD DOSE.
                   Just remember to GO EXTREMELY LOW ON THE DOSEAGES OF FLUALPRAZOLAM! it is VERY potent and the half life is REALLY long.
                    I hope this will help people. I am sure I will get some hate for this, but this is just my humble experience. Plus, all I saw were horror stories about Flualprazolam and people dismissing it out of hand as a way to taper off of phenibut. If you are not cool with flualprazolam, I respect that. But please try agmatine. It really does help, too.  Thanks for reading this! Good luck!",1,1

I went through the first 4 days in misery- cold sweats, shakiness, mood swings and probably the worst parts, constant RLS and very little sleep. I also use kratom and this has definitely helped though not really with the RLS or sleep. 

When I first came across phenibut I thought maybe I could use this instead of kratom ( which I’ve used daily for @ 3 years ). I’m tired of carrying around all my little pouches of kratom, the questions and the strange looks. I’d only have to use one little jar! WRONG! 

I ended up using both. Lately I was exhausted constantly and found joy in nothing. I made the choice to stop phenibut and then work on the kratom issue. I hate having to worry about where I will be when I have to take my next “dose” or avoiding people or situations because I wouldn’t have access when it wore off. 

As I’ve gotten older I’ve become much more prone to anxiety and have used phenibut and kratom to help control this. I don’t even remember the real “me” before starting kratom. I’m trying to get back to that, whatever it may be. 

On day 6 and after a stressful work weekend of two 12 hour shifts working in the hospital- with 1 1/2 hrs drive in both directions, both days- I still made it through. No more phenibut.

Before i started tapering i started getting this really uncomfortable empty gurgly feeling in my stomach when my food digests. (Also Feels like i can feel the food going through my intestines) anyways, anytime i felt that gurgly feeling comming on, i would feel like im going through withdrawls. That wave of anxiety  will hit me the second my stomach goes off. 

Obviously, besides for the withdrawl feeling when my stomach kicks in, i know phenibut obsorbs in your intestines. Which makes me wonder if they are linked

Since I wasn't feeling too much of it I got a bit reckless and often dosed 2 or even more times a day. I didn't use a specific dose every day, but from weighing the rest in the bag I could conclude that I used 54.4g over 12 days, on average 4.5g a day, I know this is a lot, I just didn't think much of it since I only got mild effects.

Then two days ago I just didn't think much of it I stopped, I also just felt really sick and weird that day, as if my body was buzzing a little. This went away but I couldn't sleep that night and the next day I felt just kinda anxious and my tinnitus seemed a bit louder then normal. Towards the night I also felt tension in and around my jaw. Even though I was 35 hours awake at this point I only felt somewhat tired but I could only fall asleep for 2 hours with a muscle relaxer. I just kept worried about things so I decided to just take 2g of Phenibut and then I could sleep another 2 hours. Now it came to me, it's phenibut withdrawal! It was a huge relieve to finally know why I felt so off.

About 4 hours later (now) I took another 1.5g and now I feel pretty normal with some odd mood swings, but I would like to know what's the best thing to do and what to expect. Should I just go cold turky, or rather taper? I still have 34g left. Since I didn't use it very long and basically just went on a reckless binge, would there be even a point to tapering?

I’ve been on Phenibut daily for 5 years started out like most of us, carelessly using until it was too late and WD kicked in when you “ran out” of your first jug. 

I’ve fought down to taper with baclofen assisting me, along with NAC Agmatine and Memantine (didn’t do too much for me honestly) 

Dosages ranging from 3-4GPD to 1GPD then back up to 4-5GPD and the rollercoaster went on and on and on. I’m finally below 1GPD, still working and still not neglecting family duties. 

I realized today that the dependence is what scares me the most. Once The pattern of taking the white powder every morning is over I’m freaking out about the next step. But at the same time I’m so EXCITED about being off of this crap and want to rediscover my life Phenibut free.

After I’m 100% done with Phenibut and feel the acutes subside I’m going to tackle Kratom next, still on 20GPD but feel that’s going to be an “easier” hurdle to overcome because I’ve experienced the Kratom WD before, physical WD are easier to me than the mental glutamate-rush WD.

The first three months I used it on the weekend, taking Monday-Thursday off. My weekend doses climbed from 1.5gpd to 4.5gpd. Soon I was experiencing rebound anxiety during the week so I began adding 1.5gpd weekday doses. By the fourth month, I was using every day.

Before long, I became a 4-6gpd user. 

Phenibut cured my anxiety and depression, helped me get excellent grades in grad school, motivated my workouts, helped me achieve incredible relaxation and post-workout sleep, sent my sex drive thru the roof and gave me the added confidence [and impulsiveness] to have a wildly thriving sex life. It enhanced every aspect of my life.

I did experience tolerance and some diminishing returns, but I rarely ever let myself take more than 6gpd. 

I started experiencing disturbing side effects-- tinnitus (loud ringing in my ears), strange nervous system sensations, pins&needles, nerve pain in my head, night terrors-- and I had already known that phenibut couldn't really be healthy. The cons seemed to finally outweigh the pros.

September 2020 marked 12 months of phenibut dependency. I decided to cut down dramatically. I dropped 1gpd each week (from 6gpd to 5gpd to 4gpd to 3gpd) over the course of one month.

I felt WAY better using phenibut after adjusting to under 3gpd. October, November, December, i averaged between 2-3gpd. January, February, i averaged between 1-2gpd. 

The final 6 weeks, I had gotten below 1gpd, and I dropped by 20mg per day until I reached zero. Toward the end, my doses were so minuscule, they probably only had a placebo effect. 

It has been 4 days since my last tiny dose, and I  haven't experienced any withdrawal effects. My taper wasn't perfect, and I could have gotten from 3gpd to 1gpd more quickly than I did. Still, I managed to get from a serious dependency to zero phenibut, and I feel good.

I quit nicotine several months ago, during the taper, and I also stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks after noticing heightened sensitivity to caffeine. I take a couple pulls off a dispensary THC cart in the evening after dinner, and I sleep quite well. I wake up feeling good. My sex drive is normal. Music sounds great. 

I hope others can find success with a slow taper. I expected more withdrawal effects at the zero mark, but they never came. I presume I spread my withdrawal symptoms over a long enough period that they weren't noticeable.",20,0

I’ve got quite a bit of responsibilities that pretty much demand that I be on my A-game every day, and a slip up now could be really bad.

&#x200B;

I recently ate some special mushrooms that resulted in one of the most scary but happy experiences of my life. The result was the realization that I needed to try and  stop the vices I currently use to cope with my anxiety and depression. I honestly felt that, for once in my life, I could actually do it.

&#x200B;

I seriously underestimated how addicting phenibut is. After about two days of detoxing I managed to destroy an important relationship, land myself in hot water at work, and fall to the brink of failing 2 courses (that I literally can’t afford to fail). On top of all this, I tried picking up vices, I had previously dropped to help cope (alcohol, nicotine, weed, in significantly less amounts than I had done before, classic addict mentally in retrospect) which may have honestly made it worse.

&#x200B;

I’ve seen that people are using baclofen to taper off but I don’t think my doctor is going to go for it. He is  very old, and I really don't want him to discontinue other treatments and recommend me to an addiction rehabilitation program.

&#x200B;

I only recently escalated to daily dosages of phenibut at about 3-4 grams a day. I've occasionally gone up to 5 grams but only a handful of times.

In the past I have taken lyrica and plenty of benzos and have always had a massive natural tolerance to GABA substances.

I took phen last monday for the first time at 1.5g and felt nothing. The next day I took 2.5 g and felt nothing until I drank and smoked weed. Third day I took 4.5 g, felt extremely nauseous if I wasn't moving (was on a bike ride) and otherwise felt very similar to a high dose of GHB. I took thursday off and felt fine. Then both Friday and Saturday I took 4 grams, before deciding that I better not play with fire, having seen the warnings on the phenibut sub and this sub.

I was hungover from drinking on saturday night, but Sunday wasnt so bad. But then Monday and yesterday absolutely destroyed me. I've never had withdrawals from a GABA substance and have done them for longer than this. I did NOT expect this after 5 days with a break in-between. I was wondering if I'd caught the 'rona, because I have a cough from smoking so much weed last week (normally weed makes me anxious but not with GABA drugs).

I was at the cottage until last night and first thing I did when I got home was take 3 grams because I felt so awful. It seemed to help but honestly I still didnt feel great (still wonder if it's 'rona). Today I took two grams, and I still feel kind of shit. But I figure that since I've taken it for so short of time, now day 7, with space days, I could probably get away with a super fast taper of like 500 mg a day. But I have also been shocked by how severe the effects were from just 5 days so I could be totally wrong - and if I feel anywhere near as bad as Sunday/Monday then it's not worth it.

My concern is that if I try to do a slow/normal taper I will actually worsen the dependance a lot - despite my feeling awful after 5 days, I have to assume that tapering for two weeks and then stopping is going to feel even worse when I stop (could be wrong tho). I also only had 180 of 250 mg capsules, so if I do a normal taper I will be cutting it close to running out (if not running out- I'll have to do the math). EDIT: did the math, I have 23.5 g left, and don't really know what dose to be tapering from - that doesnt seem like a lot though. I also live in Canada so no quick shipping.",2,2

Trying to taper without any substance other than NAC feels like it's made things worse cause i got scared and up the dose to not get withdrawals to 4gpd from 3gpd.

I really badly want to get off phenibut because even at these doses i still feel shit prob cause my tolerance is higher than 4gpd but i want to not go too high so i can quit. Even using it everyday it's still scary cause i feel like having the worst anxiety of my life and taking phenibut does not help.

So decided to try to taper and switching using baclofen.

So here is what i have: 30g phenibut left and 60 baclofen 10mg tabs, enough 0.5mg Alprazolam and and 15 2g Clonazepam, 30 Zolpidem, Nac, agmatine and memantine. Also, i don't want to switch addictions so need to do this as quick as possible to not get hooked on baclofen and make it as painless as possible.

This is my plan of action..

Want to start by tapering so i would take 1.5g phen in the morning and take 10mg baclofen the afternoon and 1.5g at 6pm for 2 days, then 1.2g phen in the morning then 10mg baclofen at 11am and 3pm another 10mg baclofen and 800mg phen 6pm and maybe 5-10mg baclofen before bed if need be. Then 1g phen in the morning and 10mg baclofen at 11am then 3pm 10mg baclofen and 700mg phen 6pm- before bed as soon as i need it.

Then i make the switch 15mg baclofen in the morning and 15mg afternoon as soon as i need it and 15mg at 5pm and 10mg before bed. 2nd day 15mg baclofen in the morning and 15mg afternoon as soon as i need it and 15mg at 7pm and try to skip the 10mg before bed.

3rd day i am scared of so i will take same as 1st and 2nd day and take 15mg before bed. 4th day i will take 15mg in the morning  and 10mg the afternoon 10mg the evening and if needed another 10mg. 5th day 10mg 4 times a day. 6th day 10mg 3 times a day. 7th day 5mg 4 times a day and then 5mg 3 times a day and then 10 mg 2 times a day and then 5mg 2 times a day then 5mg when i need it and so on.

I have enough 0.5mg Alprazolam and and 15 2g Clonazepam to take when needed(not to get hooked on them) and got 30 Zolpidem to sleep but also have a high tolerance to Zolpidem so battle to sleep 6 hours with 10mg as it is now but could be cause of phenibut withdrawals.

Sorry to bore you with the details but i need all the advice i can get and try to give as much info as possible to get off phenibut and get out of this hell asap and not get hooked on baclofen so looking back on my plan it seems scary and i could get in trouble with baclofen so any advice would be much appreciated.

I got right about 35 days after quitting, but I started using kratom again and had the worst year of my life just full of anxiety and panic. Ever since I haven’t been able to shake it. I’m much better, no true doom or real panic attacks besides almost having one after doing a fair amount of quality cocaine/alcohol then staying up till 7am smoking weed. Figured that would happen. 

If I used substances I am totally good, a small amount of a benzo and I’m solid but I’m trying to stay completely clean besides THC. I got off drug tests and unfortunately started using adderall and even got into meth for a few days unfortunately bc it helped me feel better but made it way worse after. 


This whole year has been me trying to get right, and I’m tired guys. My girl got off methadone after being on it for like 8 years, dealing with her has been rough atleast she’s finally getting right after weeks of madness. I have had these thoughts where I just want to kill myself bc I’ve never had anxiety and can’t do it. It’s ruining my life. Worse than years of opiates in my mind. 


I’m going to stay completely clean for a month, snd if I’m not right I’m going to the doctor. I can tell my blood pressure gets high, I feel it in my jugular. It gets tight, my ears and face will get hot... if I didn’t know how to deal with panic, I’d be right back to panic attacks. It feels like I’m always in fight or flight, unless I’m with friends/busy doing something I WANT.

I ordered phenibut not even knowing about the withdrawal. It didn’t say it on the phenibut I bought. What happened I still take accountability for. I started taking a half a teaspoon 1.4g then tolerance gained j started taking that 3-7 times within a day. I took it for 5 months. I switched jobs and started a new good one but it was 2nd shift instead of day and all of a sudden I start not sleeping having crazy hallucinations after I was up for 2 weeks. I worked those 2 weeks towards the end it got bad I gave the phenibut to doctor she put me in a hospital they didn’t do anything so they send me back with my gf and here’s where shit gets crazy that I don’t remember my friend who’s a nurse recommended driving me to a different set of hospitals called Lewis gale saying they would treat me better then ballad health which was the other one my girlfriend drove me they apparently I was arguing and talking crazy shit. All of a sudden I was in this doctors place and saw a psychiatrist on a screen for quitting phenibut and there were nurses and she prescribed Valium and sent it off all off a sudden blood starts squirting out the bottom of my eye the whole time filler up the room with this weird stuff that solidated. One the doctors left the place turned into a Farris wheel where my mom was with my girlfriend at the bottom my mom was telling me the guy that owned the place would help make me a lot of money anyway he made me sit there the Farris wheel served drug my girlfriend tried to climb it and she got ripped in half and she was pregnant at the time it was like terror fueled horror. Once it ripped her in half the car I was in went into a hospital then it was a loop had another hallucination which was actually in the hospital and thought I was framed as a child molester and the nurses were gonna shoot me and they had a gun. They gave me fentanyl propophol and versed trying to know me out in icu still couldn’t I was on a ventilator they let my mom and girlfriend see me cause they thought I was gonna die I don’t remember it. I came back to the last three days I was on sleeping medicine .5mg klonopin Ativan iv gabapentin 300mg. I already take suboxone. It was weird anyways my baby’s gonna be here soon my brains still healing but my interest and feeling of enjoyment have came back well been at my job for over 3 months now have saved money I still take the klonopin and gabapentin. I’ve saved up money bought an Xbox tv and things I had 3 siezures in the hospital I have 2 bald spots from where my head layer on one side in icu I’m glad I was ok I’ve never experienced such an awful withdrawal other than heroin.

61,2021-04-17 12:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/msufsk/third_day_free_from_phenibut/,Third Day Free from Phenibut!,"Today is my third day free from Phenibut/baclofen.  I will never touch Phenibut again. This is not medical advice. It is simply the methodology I used to quit. 

Overview: at the height of my use (about 1 year ago), I was using about 7 gpd of phenibut. My dosage was two even amounts per day (6 am and 8 pm).  I tapered down to 1.2 gpd before I switched to baclofen to completely replace the phenibut.  When I switched to baclofen, I dosed 3 times per day. I tapered the baclofen until I stopped taking it 3 days ago. 

Phenibut Taper: My phenibut was dosed in two equal amounts per day. Once per week, I reduced each dose by 0.1 g, for a total reduction of 0.2g per week. I kept this amount constant even as the doses got lower and lower. I have a rather stressful meeting at work that takes place once per week. I did not want to be uncomfortable from withdrawals during this meeting, so I always did my taper reduction for the week after that meeting. By the time it rolled around for the next week, I was always comfortable again. I did this until I reached two doses of 0.6 g per day. 

Switch to Baclofen: I know the wisdom on here is to replace 1 g of phenibut with 10 mg of baclofen, but I wanted the switch to be painless. I switched my dose from 0.6 g of phenibut twice per day to 15 mg of baclofen 3 times per day, for a total of 45 mg of baclofen per day (dosed every 8 hours). The only trouble I had was less restful sleep the first night of the switch. It felt as if I had laid in bed all night with my eyes closed without actually falling asleep. I attribute this to my body not being put into an artificially deep sleep from phenibut. There was no increased anxiety at all. I realize I was risking setting myself back since I used more baclofen than the commonly-accepted conversion rate of 10mg of baclofen per 1 g of phenibut, but I trusted the fact that baclofen was easier to reduce. The baclofen was much easier to reduce, so the risk paid off. 

Baclofen Taper: Just like my once-per-week reduction of phenibut, I used the same method for the baclofen. After my meeting each week, I reduced each dose of baclofen by 5mg. Therefore, the first week I used 45 mg, then 30 mg, then 15 mg, then 0.   The only anxiety I experienced was for about 12 hours after each reduction. After that time period, it was almost as if the anxiety suddenly lifted (even at the new, lower dose).  The baclofen reductions were much easier to handle than the phenibut reductions.

I am so happy to be done with this! There is light at the end of the tunnel!  I welcome any questions about my experience. Otherwise, just know: you got this!",19,0

I wasn’t really sure how I’d arrived here, I didn’t remember much prior. But I didn’t really dwell on it, because I felt amazing. Pushing 200 with no shirt, bobbing and weaving through traffic. I felt the sun rays warming my skin, baby blue skies with a few puffy white clouds scattered about. 

I knew the area pretty well, it was familiar. I’d grown up here, and I guess it was time to pay a visit. I’ve been gone about 5 years or so, since my parents had a nasty divorce and I’d moved off to attend college. None of that mattered, though, I was just here for the ride. 

Everything was a blur as I blasted by vehicles that seemed to be at a standstill. I could go as long as I still had road ahead of me. I passed under a bridge and noticed some blue lights flashing to my right. I just laughed as I left them in the dust.

But as I drove I felt a shift in the atmosphere, the baby blue skies swallowed up by dark, angry clouds. At once a loud crack rattled me to the core. It must of been 20 or 30 feet away... lightning.
It ripped through a tree, leaving it burned, mangled, and disfigured. 

But I rode on, through the storm. I couldn’t see more than 5 or 10 feet ahead, I felt as though the wind might lift me off the road. I’d always wanted to fly. 

It was exhilarating, and I gained speed. My survival based purely off of reaction time as cars would appear ahead of me, and....

I was flying. I guess I didn’t see him, maybe I was distracted. I moved in slow motion. I looked back, my bike burned, mangled, and disfigured. 

I hit the ground. You would think such a crash would kill you on impact. I wasn’t so lucky. My skin ripped from my arms, and I slid 25 to 30 feet into a pile of barbed wire and thorns. The barbed wire caught my legs, and slapped my torso into a bed of thorns and nails. My bones broken, but spine still intact, I felt everything. 

I tried to pull, and the barbed wire drove deeper into my skin. I screamed in agony, but I knew this was my fate. Blood started to run out of my mouth, as a metal pipe had impaled my stomach. I looked down and noticed my pants had been pulled off during the crash, and my penis was ripped in half with thorns dug into the head. I had a pistol in my pocket, and only wanted to pull it out and burn my nose off. But my arms had been shattered, like glass.

I heard a crack of lightning, and the smell of human flesh filled my nose. Burned, mangled, and disfigured, I finally found peace.

I sprung upwards in bed, shaking and covered in sweat. Man... These withdrawals are some shit.",5,0

Ive done phenibut for 1.5 years now, in the 1st year i always did it 2 times a week, starting from 1g working myself upto 5g and then taking a tolerance break for 3 weeks as i wasnt occupied back then and was easily able to do it without anything i had to attend to everyday.

&#x200B;

The last few months since December though has gotten quite bad and out of control in some way, im taking it 3 times a week now but my tolerance has sky rocketed because a few times i took it 2 days in a row but only like 3 times over 5 months but yeah i ordered a 250g package 3 weeks ago i thought, but ive only had it for 2 weeks now and ive already taken it all. I really wanna get my tolerance down to 1-2g's again, but while im still able to take it so i can just feel the phenibut taking away a portion of my social anxiety, instead of me the last months chasing the same high from phenibut that gives you barely none social anxiety and euphoria in the body.

Im just tired of this, and i feel like it might be damaging my body a lot, my memory is shit like i often forget that ive already told people something and end up explaining it to them again, or they tell me stuff and i forgot it the day after. I also mostly cant really remember what i did 2-3 days ago.

&#x200B;

If im doing 40g's every time i take it, could i go down to 35g the next time, and 30g the next time, and so on since im not one that has taken it everyday, just large portions each time. I just want to know how i should do it, and how fast i should attempt to do it.

Thank you for any answers i get.  I still wanna say though, phenibut has been worth it for me with social anxiety holding me back so hard on my life these past few years, and after discovering it and lowering my anxiety, ive been able to accomplish so much more in my life, and im happier than ever besides this phenibut problem.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanna say what im experiencing right now is pretty tough and i have really bad anxiety. I have my last bit of phenibut for tomorrow, after not taking it for 2 days so far, and im planning to take that and then wait till monday where i get the next 250 package. I think ill taper down 5-10g every time i take it, each day of the week where i dose. As now im thinking about it, i usually take it 4 times a week. Fuck man im feeling so shit",5,0

It's called fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) , and i keep reading that microdosing (definetly not tripping) with it , could help to quit phenibut or benzos and mushroom by itself is quite euohoric and acts on gaba receptors.

If any of you have any expierence with it , please share.

I have some of amanita muscaria just arrived , and thinking of trying it this weekend.

I'm dependant of phenibut low doses daily (300-500mg a day) but been using like that for about 3 years. so if i stop , i definetly feel not well. also i take kratom almost the same amount of time. And i really would like to take a break from these substances because i can feel how it fucking changed me,and it seems like i've got so much more stupid in these three years.

I have some hopes with amanita muscaria. It's completely different thing from psilocybin mushrooms , you cannot trip on it (you can , but its definetly not pleasant , it is dangerous and you can die from big doses of this mushroom) but doses 0,5 - 5g should be a good tonic for life , and could be used daily with some breaks.

I just wanted to hear some expierences first hand. :)

I took 250mg 3x a day for about 4-5 months straight. So far it hasn't been too, too bad. I've had some heightened anxiety/depression (maybe a return to baseline?) for sure, but nothing too crippling or overwhelming. 

There have been a few days where I thought, ""fuck it, this isn't so bad, I should just go back on my original dose to make my life better"" but luckily have not given into that thought as I know in the long-term I'm doing myself a serious favor. Sleep is definitely not good at this point, which is the worst of what I've had to deal with. I don't usually have sleep issues but tapering has caused noticeable issues (harder to fall asleep/stay asleep/poor sleep quality). I cut out my midday and nighttime doses first just because I'd rather feel better during daylight hours with compromised sleep vs. be in mild w/d feeling all day only to get relief at night. I think my taper might've went smoother had I left my nighttime dose for last though. 

Anyway, it's been a little rough, but nothing compared to faster tapers of say benzos or opiates, IME. I'm just happy I'm getting off phenibut before it can have a real chance to ruin my life in the future with addiction/side effects/etc, regardless of where that leaves me with my own mental health. I'm on the homestretch I feel, so send good vibes please!

Hello all, I am currently at 3.7g of phenibut HCL a day and have been for at least 6 months, and I have yet to be in a situation that I have had to go without and am personally unaware of how dramatic the withdrawal will be (I am making the conscious decision to get off of this substance as I have a baby on the way and he is due in late July). Pheni doesn't get me ""high"" anymore, just keeps my anxiety at bay and I once I got to my current dosage months ago I elected not to raise the dose. I can only surmise that where I am at is keeping me ""normal"" at this point.

I know cold turkey is not the way to go, I have began lowering my dosage 50mg every other day for the past week and I cannot tell a difference. I will have a source for a few dozen 600mg gabapentin on the first of next month, should I just continue this taper and use 300mg of gabapentin at a time if I experience any issues?

Did I dodge a bullet? Please tell me to stay the hell away from it. I’ve had problems with gabapentin, kratom, suboxone, and opiates, and I’m finally now clean of all of it.

I’ve been using two cans of 7mg nicotine salts, (20 pouches a can). Thats 40 pouches or 280mg of nicotine a day, for a year. Prior to that two cans of smokeless tobacco a day for 7 years (well, one can a day for around 5, then two for the next 2 years). My logic was and is that anything was better than putting that cancerous shit in my mouth. 

So I switched to 4mg pouches yesterday, which basically cut my dose in half (not completely). It 40 of those is 160mg.

But I feel like its amplified my phenibut withdrawal. I’ve been through nicotine withdrawal enough times to know this isn’t what nicotine withdrawal feels like; Its like I’ve skipped the nicotine withdrawal and went straight back into phenibut withdrawal. 

So I don’t know if I should just chill on my phenibut taper, stay at 3g, and take a week or so to quit nicotine then back to tapering (albiet, much slower. 3g was my original goal now I’m switching to .1g taper).

I started my phenibut use 2 months ago, and after that first dose I fell in love with this substance. I have a history of severe depression as well as social anxiety so this was the perfect fix etc. I had read about how addictive it can be but chose to disregard this(foolish given I’m an addict but my brain doesn’t work in my favor sometimes). Immediately after that first day I took another 1 gram dose, and within the following 2 months I managed to get up to 3gpd with 4 gram doses mixed in on the weekends. I’d say about 5 weeks in I noticed the substance lacked what it first gave me, I chose to push on still and by week 8 I was a “phen zombie”. This drug turned so fast and I felt like I was viewing life from 3rd person during this time, total brain fog, I noticed I barely talked when I’d hangout with friends and on top of this I was more depressed than when I started phenibut. 

So last Thursday I decided I was going cold turkey, I went in with a sense of optimism as I thought my usage window and dosage were low enough. The first three days were smooth sailing for the most part, I had NAC, agmatine, and kratom to help me through it. I was also lucky to have some cyclobenzaprine(muscle relaxer) which made sleeping effortless, I really felt as if I’d jumped off successfully, that was until Sunday night came. Around midnight I had a sharp stabbing chest pain right in my heart. The following hour I dealt with heart palpitations, intense tachycardia, and a shooting pain that went from my heart up to my neck. In a panic I dosed a gram of phenibut hoping it would help, but it provided no relief. I’ve had heart issues before but this was so different, I was legitimately scared for my life, something I honestly hadn’t felt this intensely before. 

I quickly made my way to the ER, and they hooked me up to an IV of something to calm me down, I didn’t even ask what. They said I had a BP of 211/110 and was lucky I came in when I did or things would’ve gotten worse. Now here’s the shitty part, I explained to them over and over what phenibut was and how I was going through a withdrawal but instead of giving me anything for the road they got my vitals to baseline, sent me home, and told me to visit my family doctor(very helpful right?) so the following day I dosed 1.5 grams(900mg morning, 600mg night) and decided I need to obviously taper. It’s now Wednesday and I’m at 900mg, i haven’t experienced any discomfort and will probably continue to drop 300mg a day until Im at 300mg, then I plan to jump off slowly to hopefully eliminate w/d. Also going to see my doc Friday about getting some baclofen or gabapentin. I can’t wait to be done with this substance. Don’t make the same mistake I did, just do a taper it’ll probably save you a lot of pain and a nice ER bill.

Update: the 300mg a day was too harsh, Wednesday night I was pretty uncomfortable. More palpitations and tachycardia, so I dosed another 300mg that night to bring me back up to 900mg for the day. It’s now Friday and I’m at 700mg for the day, so far no problems, looks like I could be off by next week if this works!",6,0

I used one day after the other in tbe beginnint with like 1-2 grams.  Then every third day Id take 3-4 grams.  Id use 4-6 grams in a day every 3rd or 4th day after I did this.  I did 6g, then 3 days later 4 ir 5, then 4 days later 5g.  Before I did the last dose I wasn't having any withdrawals but last night (2 days after that 5 gram dose) i was having anxiety and worries of seizures (im epileptic so my threshold is much lower).  I know the dosage I was taking was high but I was doing it pretty spaced out and I'm confused about the random effects of withdrawals.  Now I'm gonna wean myself off but I'm not sure how much to go down.  I took 3.5 grams this morning which is 1.5 less than the dose before.  I want to get out as quickly as possible without worrying about having seizures.  What taper would you guys recommend?  I'll only dose every 48 hours or so.  I know its silly to use such a high dose especially with prior health issues.  I don't want to hear about that.  Just need some help because I've already decided to stop.  As I said, I've only used it like 3 weeks.  Probably 30 grams or so total.  I don't want to deal with seizures.  It's my biggest fear.",1,0

The phenibut takes away all the edginess and adds this layer of euphoria that's on par with MDMA. 

It's like a never ending light roll that last forever and it tends to make the adderall 2x as long. But the only issue is that my supply for both are very strong. My connections for both substances is great and it's starting to take a toll on my mental health. I find myself going through mood swings the day after I use the combo and that'll last for like a week or so.


I notice that very small things annoy me and even with 8 hours of sleep each night, I still feel exhausted unless I dose again. Has anyone here also been through stimulant and phenibut combo addiction?

I really want to stop but the withdrawal from both and rebound from both are making it EXTREMELY difficult. I suggest anyone reading this try this combo at your own risk if you have an addictive personality. It feels amazing.",3,0

I know that it's generally better to deal with symptoms rather than covering them up with another drug, but if it's between this or more Phenibut I'd say that this is a healthier alternative.

This post is premature. It's been 5 days now since my overdose of 15 grams with no tolerance and in the following days I felt anxious, sluggish, have had no appetite, no ability to do any of my school work or basic things like getting groceries. I haven't taken any more phenibut since then, and I thought it would be weeks before I could feel functional, but a package of Gotu Kola arrived yesterday and taking one 450mg pill made me feel better than my average, I finally put 2 real meals in me, cleaned a little bit, talked on the phone, and went grocery shopping, I even got a decent sleep albeit with some crazy dreams, all things that wouldn't have happened otherwise. 

Gotu Kola is a GABAergic but supposedly has no withdrawals, addiction potential or rebound anxiety, though I haven't tested that yet. It's also known to promote healthier skin, increase circulation, promote working memory, and be a mood enhancer. 

If you're occasionally taking phenibut just to feel like yourself this is probably a much healthier alternative which actually has some positive effects on ones body. 

Again, I'm not an expert on this, this is just my very short experience with Gotu Kola and an attempt to bring it to the attention of those who may not know about it.",9,0

I’m at 3.86g x2 a day, morning and night. My GP is thankfully awesome. She’s aware of the situation, and together her and I have tapered off a 600mg a day Lyrica addiction, (which was surprisingly effortless) and a 5mg a day Xanax habit, (this one sucked, but over time it was totally doable). I was taking all three at once, the phenibut at varying but progressive dosages. It’s funny, I started all of these drugs because I had become addicted to GHB, (I’m a depressive, it brought a lot of color, but an equal amount of destruction into my life) and after a round of barbaric detox at camh, the alleged ‘Cutting’ edge in mental health and addiction research in Toronto, I would inevitably find myself rolling in the juice usually a few weeks after getting out. 

I did some research. At the time, my old GP, who was totally unfamiliar, stigmatizing and judgemental towards drug users, suggested that I use Lyrica as an antidepressant due to my history with substance abuse, and the fact that it was non-habit forming, or a drug you could abuse. (It was sort of unknown at this point, but I quickly realized that it’s street value was insane and everyone was about it lol). It did fuck all for me, other than knock me on my ass of 72 full hours. I felt, and never did feel any positive effect from it. I know a lot of people on other feeds rave about it, but I found it to be zombifying and underwhelming at best. In fact the only positive was that it potentiated all the other drugs I was on. 

It’s main advantage I discovered was how well it worked when used in a high dose alongside phenibut to get off of GHB after a weekend bender. These little vacations would always leave me physically dependent. My Brain loved the shit and had a hard time off of it. I wrote it all down somewhere, and I’m not advocating this or saying anyone else should do it because this could be a potentially fatal withdrawal, but I found that when I took my last shot of g, if I did it with a huge dose of lyrica, and a gram of phenibut, it completely negated the ‘fear’. A term I used for the intensely dangerous, psychosis laden withdrawal off of GHB. It even made it sort of fun and trippy. Turns out Lyrica is great at protecting your neurons from the damage caused by lack of GHB, and the subsequent flood of glutamate and excitoxicity that happens during this process. So I would sort of drift off into this vaguely hallucinogenic, deepened slumber which would generally last from 12-15 hours. It was peaceful, painless and afterwards I would follow this strict regiment of taken only enough phenibut/Lyrica that I wouldn’t become addicted if I tapered down quickly. 

Until I just started to take both of those drugs daily. Which is how I ended up here. 

I find now that my GHB use is basically rendered useless. I feel like Phenibut is what methadone is to GHB’s fentanyl. I work at a a safe injection site in toronto, so I hear a lot about how methadone increases people’s tolerance to fent or other opiates, I’m not sure what the mechanism of action is there, but it sounds similar to how phenibut works. Additionally GHB/FENT=rush, super intoxicating, major CNS depressants, fast hard debilitating/potentially life threatening WD’s, (especially now with the amount of etizolam which is extremely common to find in fentanyl these days, which makes dopesickness an actual life threatening condition) vs PHENIBUT/METHADONE=mildly intoxicating, a feeling of wellness, not incredibly dangerous but obviously use some sense especially when mixing, but these two come with an even harder, more excruciating withdrawal. However methadone doesn’t put you at risk for seizures. It just sucks really bad from the multiple people thatve told me about it. 

Long story boring, people who are on a steady regiment of methadone, have to use a lot more fentanyl to feel it’s effects, and it’s not nearly as fun as just using fentanyl without the methadone. Which is the same way I feel that phenibut has taken the fun out of GHB. I literally never have flails anymore, not that these are always great, but every once in a while they can be fun. The high lasts maybe 20 minutes at most, and it’s dull and sort of pointless. 

Sorry I’m really getting off track here.. 

I now use phenibut daily still, 3.86g, with a .5 klonopin back every morning and night. 

I realize that this isn’t sustainable. I buy it in kilos, and usually stock up big time when I have to, so I don’t usually have a threat of running out, unless I’m incarcerated but usually I’m pretty good. Still something that scares the shit out of me tho. I don’t really have any reason to be arrested in general unless it’s for rallying or protesting something, but these are usually peaceful and I’m safe with what I carry/act. I hear horror stories from folks at the site who are often arrested and put into holding. Their cries for a doctor while being in a white-knuckled, pant-shitting state of opiate withdrawals are almost always purposely ignored, which i consider a heinous violation of human rights and a dehumanizing torturous experience that our corrupt brutalist prison system needs to wake the fuck up to. 

It makes me think of what would happen if it were myself in that situation. Most doctors don’t even fuckin know what phenibut is! I literally had to ask three MD’s whom all specialize in addiction medicine to finally get one that had even heard of it, and she (thankfully) took the time to get to know it and understand how it works, which she basically did by going through Reddit posts lol. (Big ups, Reddit is officially unofficial medical literature). I highly doubt tho that any prison doctor would know or even give a flying FUCK if I were to be going through a hard phenibut withdrawal. To the untrained eye the WD’s with fentanyl and phenibut are similar, sweats, profusive vomiting, chills, shakes, restlessness, insomnia. The obvious difference being the risk of a cerebral event like a seizure or the myriad of other life threatening issues a long term phenibut user could endure. 

It’s scares the shit out of me, potentially dying in a prison cell with a bunch of CO’s staring at me like I couldn’t handle being dopesick. Chuckling, “hey look at that one squirm”. 

I’m again, not at huge risk of being arrested, but still. 

Also again, sidetracked. 

I honestly just wish there was a way to have it brought into Canada and approved by health Canada to be used and distributed pharmaceutically. My quality of life has vastly increased since I’ve started using this drug. I’m happier, more engaged, motivated. I’m not the person who walks through life in a state of perpetual anhedonia anymore. I feel good, like honestly happy to be here. More so than I ever have. 

But I also realize that this is there is a lie that phenibut instills in your brain. There is a horribly dark side to it. The brain fog. The amnesiatic effect it has. Total memory lapses. The non-linear thought process and the frustration which happens as a result. The subtle anxiety. The total control it has over everything. It’s like a fucking nightmare. It’s not working for me, ive just convinced myself that everything’s the best which is unfair, and I need to stop doing this to myself. I would honestly rather feel nothing than continue living a comfortable lie, because at least I know I can work with ground zero now. 

Any suggestions? I’ve been using this drug every day for four years. I’ve considered going back down at the rate I went up. But I can’t imagine that’s sustainable. My GP had given me a script for baclofen, which I’m supposed to take while doing a 10% taper every two weeks, increasing the dosage of baclofen as needed. 

Has anyone ever done that well?

The next day, I woke up and felt ill, I was incredibly tired, I kept throwing up, I would fall asleep and had to be shaken very hard to be woken up, I had what I can only assume are micro seizures, my blood pressure fluctuated wildly, I had visual artifacts showing up, it was a very negative experience overall and I was stupid for taking that much. 

Since then, I haven't had any. I feel more anxious, empty, my appetite is diminished, and I've had a hard time sleeping well. Part of this I have to attribute to dehydration and a lack of quality food, but I think a lot of it is due to the phenibut. I've read some reports of overdoses, but haven't yet come across the specific symptoms that I'm describing, only more serious ones. 

I wasn't addicted prior to taking this dose, and I felt pretty good generally on days without it.

I then took 3g every day for the last 5 months.

So been trying to taper for the last month but with no success so this  so on Friday cause I would be home all weekend I decided to do a fast taper of 500mg off my 3g and the first day but also taking 2.5g in 4 small doses cause bigger doses give me anxiety.

The morning I took 690mg using a scoop which was cool felt normal and not high was perfect just what io wanted. At 2 pm took another 690mg which I did not feel at all and was still ok but not good as first 690mg. Then by5pm I started feeling anxiety and feel which I though is wd so decided to try 500mg and see.

2 hours later the 500mg phenibut gave me this pressure in my head and started to get very very anxious. My heart start beating very fast and i started to feel like I was going to die and loose consciousness. Tried not to panic and stick with it cause wanted to take another 500mg before bed.

At 7pm I though really I was going to die or have a seizure so I said f that so I took a 1.380mg dose and after that kicked in I felt a lot better.

So basically that taper did more harm than good cause yesterday day I took 4g and today 2g and it's not even 1pm so basically I am screwed. I get wd or maybe rebound anxiety every 7 hours were I feel the phenibut wear off and then this feeling I am going to die or loose consciousness ir going to have a seizure kicks in and I take more.

I need advice how to get to a stable dose sand how to go from there.

Please I so badly want to get off phenibut and just to feel sober feels like a dream.

I also have agmatine sulphate and NAC but not sure when to use them. Also have memantine but not sure if I should take it.

Any advice how to get to a stable dose from prob going to be 4g and what substance to use and when would be greatly appreciated.

I prob got to get a scale so that would be the first thing I will do Tuesday.

Did very minimal research. I started at 500MG, nothing. 1Gram. Nothing. I just kept going up until it worked and holy hell it did. I work in sales in a fast paced industry. Past Alcohol abuse (2 years full blown horrible addiction 2015-2017) has made me prone to anxiety attacks and lack of confidence. When I found my 6Gram point, it was a game changer. Every morning, I would load up on it and head off to work. Went from doing it on Fridays to 2 days a week to eventually everyday. This was December 2020. I ended up at 12 grams to maintain and for awhile 12 was fine. Then I got even dumber and started redosing 8 hours later. Still no problems until one day I was full on zombie, drunk feeling, miserable.

One month ago I started getting WD's out of nowhere. Not waking up with them, like 7 hours later. I knew I was in trouble bc I went through alcohol WDs an astounding amount of times. A couple weekends ago every time I would fall asleep I would wake up in a panic bc I wasn't breathing. There were weekends I never slept. What was weird is it worked perfect for months and then my body seemed to reject it in a matter of a day. What I had to do was taper my self off but I was getting WD's within hours. I couldn't dose a higher dose because I couldn't breathe.

I knew something had to change because I have a family, great job and a lot of responsibility. I just said screw it, I will just keep taking it because it works so well. When the day came that it instantly stopped, I would take a 16oz water bottle, but 6 grams in it and fill it half way. Whenever the WD's would kick in, I would take literally a sip. I had it with me at night. Every 1-2 hours, take a sip. It was hell for a month. I would then got to 5 grams. Then 4. etc....changing it every day to lower doses. Today was the first day that I have not taken a single sip and feel almost normal besides horrible allergies.

If you are going to come on here and be a dbag like 50% of the people on here, go eat a D. I knew for the most part the risks. I knew what to do to come off of it. In my head I thought it would be easier but I did the same thing with Alcohol. Water to alcohol ratio, sip it when needed, eventually you are off. Phenibut is some dangerous shit if you get carried away. Going from talkative, confident, perfect to dropping off a cliff with ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING was really wild and never was expected.

2 times a week. Spread out. Find your dosage. If you start going through WD's, try my method. If you are hooked on 3 Grams, the first couple days put 3 in a water bottle and sip ONLY TO HOLD OFF WD's. Then go down from there. It worked really well and no one had a fkn clue.",11,0

I can't taper because phenibut stopped working all together. It didn't matter how much or how little I took my heart would beat fast and I couldn't sleep so I figured if I wasn't sleeping on phenibut I will just detox and not sleep but then I think mabye if I try and dose a gram it'll work but who knows.

I started phenibut because I bodybuild and I wasn't sleeping good and it worked for a while and then just stopped. Now I can't even work out because I can't sleep. You do more damage working out and not recovering then anything. I would give anything to get the sleep I thought was bad b4 I started phenibut. Life is funny like that.

Saturday night of last week I’ve begun experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks that don’t seem to go away relative to my dose. Luckily I have seroquel for sleep and have managed to get a decent amount of sleep the past week. My receptors seem to not be fully desensitized yet as I’m on some sort of middle ground where Some parts of the day I’d say I’m 90% normal but then other parts it dips to maybe 30% with extremely high bpm and blood pressure. 

In this state what are my options?

Should I taper whilst in this state? Or should I try to maintain 18gpd hoping my receptors will stabilize. 

Drugs I have to help:

Seroquel (for sleep and potential psychosis)
30 x gabapentin 300mg 
Agnatine

I hadn’t taken it in a year or so and took 750 mg faa yesterday in two doses. It was waaaaay too much in the sense that I was intending for a more therapeutic effect rather than recreational, but 7 hours after my second dose it was extremely powerful and euphoric and stimulating. I haven’t taken it in 14 hours and still feel it pretty strongly but more like a Valium effect. Had more caffeine than normal and some kratom and not getting much stimulation just a sort of euphoria and all I wanna do is sit around. I’m normally pretty active. I’m worried rebound is going to hit tomorrow, as it has in the past for me. I have gone through mild withdrawl as well lasting almost a week after taking larger doses 2-3 days in a row. Learning again phenibut is not good for me. I’m pretty sensitive to it and tend to take larger doses than my body needs out of fear I’ll miss the effects then end up with rebound 🙄.

   I started taking phenibut last July, and took it daily.
   The highest dose I took was 8 gpd and got to the point where my regular daily dose ranged from 4-6 g.

A few months back, after tapering to a low dose, I gave the remaining amount of phenibut I had to a friend I trust who isn’t interested in taking it, and stayed off it for 4 weeks with the help of trazodone for sleep. However, on a bad day I bought more online and relapsed soon after it arrived and I took it daily again for at least a couple weeks. On February 20th I quit again when I ran out of phenibut and didn’t bother buying any more, so I was going on a more cold turkey route. I was still taking trazodone for sleep. Was able to stay off it for 3 weeks until I went over my friend’s house and literally saw my phenibut a the top of a medicine cabinet. I caved in and I about a gram when he wasn’t looking, but I haven’t had another dose since. (As a side note: during all this, I took fasoracetam to try and help, but in the end it made me feel crummy so I stopped)

Now I’m able to get decent sleep without trazodone, but not exactly a full night’s rest. I’m making good progress though. What’s really been helping is regular exercise and creatine supplements. Idk why but taking creatine is seeming to help me recover a little faster, or maybe it’s a placebo. Either way, I feel like I’m finally making solid progress on my recovery.",1,0
