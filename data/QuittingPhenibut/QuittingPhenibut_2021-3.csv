How  sustainable is phenibut at 1g per day? Is there a better dosage? I am  assuming the phenibut will stop working eventually because I am already a  month in and I have had to up my dose to 1.33 and 1.66 on a  particularly social weekend and ever since then my 1g daily doses have  not been hitting as hard. And even before that the strength of the  effect was slowly decreasing. I'm using it for exposure therapy for  anxiety and it would be useful to keep this train going for a bit  longer. Second question: How long of a tolerance breaks has worked for  you?

Note: I've been using phenibut on and off for years.",6

normaly my wds were not thaaaat bad, always could taper fast, had a shity week were i was aggressive  had short sleep and horrible early moring primal fear  and turned to drinking and kratom because im stupid.

this time i was in fear because of kindling effect and the  psychotic week and the followning anhedonia from last wihdrawal.

FASORACETAM

So, i researched alot about possible remedies, i ordered fasoracetam and agmatine, the faso came first and for about a week i experimented with different doses (20-100mg), i dont think it helped me to taper faster.. i always drop heavy to test substances that could help with tapering. i dropped from 12gpd to 8gdp and had like a boring day but i could fall asleep.. i woke up 6 hours later in beginning of withdrawal/rebound, had that typical inner anxiety/fear that i hate most about wd. i got out of bed and snorted 30mg of faso, the anxiety was almost gone for a few hours. 

i dont want to make this post too long, so i conclude that faso didnt affect my tolerance or made me taper faster, but it helped taking the edge of (though i strongly believe its great for wd and for some people it seems to help with tolerance)
(it also made me jittery and headaches for the first 2-3 days)

NAC

same with nac, heard about it recently and bought some, eliminated the nasty ""laying in bed at 5am and feeling like the world is ending"" anxiety. Definatly worth a try!!!

AGMATINE

now, this stuff was a game changer for me, 1 week after the faso came i started trying agmatine (750-1500mg 2-3 times daily). i already stayed with the 8gpd pheni from the faso experiment and the wds werent that bad at this point so i took my agmatine and 7,5g phenibut... well, 4 hours later i had a blast, i was fucking euphoric, listened to my favorite music, cleaned my room, took a walk etc. that feeling faded and in the early afternoon i got knocked out, when i woke up 11 hours later i had that fluffy head hangover. the full day felt like i took 2,5g phenibut without tolerance, there was ""the magic"", but more of a forced and intoxicated feeling. good thing is, i didnt really like it after, i was not like ""wow the magic is back, lets do it again"", i realised that this is not the thing that i want... eventough phenibut feels nice, the agmatine (maybe nac, because it supresses addicitve behaviour) made me realize that i dont want this eberyday

i was pretty happy with the results and dropped 1gram per day but without any phenibut high, i just felt quite normal and could sleep (more like having a 1gpd phenibut tolerance for a long time so you dont get any high from it).

as i am writing this i am on a 2,5gram+phenibut dose and im feeling good, quite normal. i was on 12g phenibut just 10 days or so ago knocking myself out with this crap substance. for 2 or 3 days now i actually dont remember that im supposed to dose phenibut, like.. it doesnt bother me, i actually have no cravings whatsoever.. but i am keeping that slow taper from 3g to 0g, like 100-200mg everyday, just to be safe with paws etc.

that being said, i am actually feeling hopeful for my future, i still take nac everyday because i read alot of good things about its mental and physical effects and for preventing addictive behaviour, as i will continue using agmatine after i no longer take phenibut

i also have a past with kratom where i alternate between kratom and phenibut (""yeah will use phenibut only for 3 days for kratom withdrawal""..""im only going to use kratom for a few days for the phenibut withdrawal"".. yeah thats some addict bullshit), considering that i also see light for my kratom future where im confident that i wont turn on that again after quitting phenibut.

soooo, yeah, FUCK YEAH, i am in the midst of a rapid phenibut taper from 12gpd and i am again interested in sport, healthy food, doing uni assingments, doing sport and stretching, i actually released my first 2 songs to spotify (although i always make music/beats... i am once again really commited to it)

THANK YOU AGMATINE
(i will say though that i am not that naive that i will rest on this thinking everything in the future will be perfect, dont worry, i will work for that, but rn i am just happy that i found something that works for me)

too everyone considering Testing out these 3 substances: just give it a try, some people had wonderful results with faso and no real difference with agmatine.. unfortunately it doesnt work for everyone.
i am probably just really lucky

i wish all of you a succesful quitting and happy sobriety!!!
love you all! the quitting phenibut and kratom subreddits really helped me alot 
(thanks to those people who mentioned faso and agmatin of which i never heard 2 weeks ago)

TL;DR 
tried fasoracetam and nac, helped with wd (especially anxiety)
agmatine helps me to do a rapid taper with no symptoms and im feeling great, really great",12

In the past I have taken f phenibut HCl once a day in the evening every day for a week and never had withdrawal. For me, the duration of f phenibut is short enough that I can take it once a day and I'm sober long enough each day for my body to maintain homeostasis (at least for a week). 

I got some gabapentin as well a couple days ago, as I was still having some benzo withdrawal symptoms in the day, like burning skin, sweating, and loose bowels. I have been taking 150 to 200mg f phenibut FAA sublingual every night the last week. I started taking 400mg gabapentin as needed about 5 times a day a couple days ago. I noticed the gabapentin gets me super loaded this time, whereas when I used it for benzo withdrawal in the past it was very subtle. After taking a few gabapentin over the course of a few hours, I feel dizzy and drowsy and my Girlfriend says I look really high. 

I tapered my f phenibut from 150 to 125 then 100 over the last few days as I was running low. This morning I was down to 2.5mg Valium and had some burning skin so I took 20mg f phenibut sublingual and 400mg gabapentin. Pretty soon I felt real dizzy and my vision was kinda weird. Dizziness and double vision happen to me when I get bad benzo withdrawal, so I was concerned maybe I was having f phenibut withdrawal, but it's possible I just felt like that from combining f phenibut and gabapentin.

Has anyone ever combined a phenibut with gabapentin? Does it magnify the effects a lot?

Also, what are phenibut withdrawal symptoms? I'm trying to figure out if I'm just loaded from mixing the two drugs or having f phenibut withdrawal.. Thanks",4

I've read the withdrawal sticky and many of the posts here but I still have some questions.

For context, I've used phenibut safely for 5 years (no more than 1.8g-2.2g once every 2 weeks, sometimes once a week but **never** more), but since becoming unemployed Nov. 2020, I started breaking my rule and taking it once every 4-7 days. In January, my long-term gf broke up with me and I've been devastated, so **I've been taking 1.7g-1.9g about 3-4 times a week for the last 3 months.**

To be more specific, it's usually something like \[4 days on, 3 days off\], \[2 days on, 2 days off, 2 days on, 1 day off\], \[3 days on, 4 days off\]. I think once or twice in the past month, I'd taken it 5 days in a row. In all of these cases, the first day off feels alright. Just kind of bored and in a stale mood, lazier and less motivated than when I'm on phenibut (although that's baseline -- I always feel like this from Nov-March due to seasonal depression), but surprisingly, no anxiety or jitters. If I try, if I do stuff despite the depression, I can still make those days feel like ""today was a good day"" just like with phenibut days. The next 1-3 days off feel the same if not slightly better, though I know that doesn't mean anything due to the long half-life and it being still in my system.

Should I do a taper? If so, what kind of structure? Should I do cold turkey? I was thinking of doing cold turkey for as many days as I can, and if I start to feel shaky, I'll just take phenibut and re-work my plan.

Thanks guys! I appreciate it so much.",2

This whole time quitting I just felt anxious and a little irritable. My sleep schedule has been really messed up but I’m getting used to it and I was during the taper. I took phenibut for 3 months, and took really high doses before I purchased a scale. When I purchased one I made sure I took like 4g. When I wanted to quit I just went from 2.5 and lowered .3 each day. I’m not in the clear yet but the withdrawal felt weird but honestly either I didn’t take it long enough for it to get major withdrawals or it doesn’t affect me like that, because no time during any of it made me feel like I wanted to give up or it was too much. I know phenibut is different for everyone but some people make it out like this is worse than hard drug withdrawals which I really don’t believe is true unless you take it for years at an extremely high dose. I quit a 7 month kratom habit awhile ago cold Turkey and that felt way worse than how I have been feeling up to today. That shit felt like hell for a month or so. Anyways I hope you guys are doing well and I hope you can keep going on your journey. My advice is to not look up horror stories on phenibut during the withdrawals, it will only make you stressed out.

I have been someone who used Phenibut daily for about 7-8 months. I took 250 mg everyday and then took 750mg once a week. My hope was to take a low dose and avoid major withdrawal.... there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I have been having a few scares in which I feel like I was having strokes. I got so scared about my health, I quit Phenibut along with all of my supplements. So to clarify that, the first day I felt like I was having a stroke was a day in which I was dosing with Phenibut for the first time in a week... I was choosing to do so because I was feeling kinda off some of the days prior. Then, that morning I took agmatine and Phenibut and felt numb on the left side of my body and just felt ill overall... I got a PCP, got a shit ton of blood work back and my doctor is pretty much like, all of your tests are fine... you have high blood pressure so take this low dose medication and we’ll meet again in a month... ever since that first day of feeling like a mini stroke, I stopped all my supplements not really thinking it would have significant negative side effects. There were maybe two more really bad episodes after that in which I felt numb again and disassociated. 

My body feels so weird everyday... I will have pins and needles around my body, muscle spasms, stomach pain after eating, a feeling of being disassociated and bouts of an increased heart rate. I changed my diet dramatically because I thought I really need to change my lifestyle but I’m starting to think that what I’m feeling is withdrawal from abuse of Phenibut. Everyday I feel a little less weird but I still go in and out of feeling weird. I told my doctor about it and he said , “oh yeah that’s a CNS depressant, that’ll take a while to feel normal again”. But he didn’t know what it was and had to look it up and he didn’t spend much time talking about it. It would give me some comfort to think that this is withdrawal symptoms that are slowly fading instead of thinking that none of their tests can pin down what’s wrong with me and what if I have cancer in my brain that’s pressing on some shit. I understand no one can give me medical advice, I have a consistent regimen set up with my doctor now. I’m just looking for people to validate my experience I guess. 

TL;DR I have been making lifestyle changes because I thought I was having strokes but now I think that it’s actually Phenibut withdrawal. But not sure since I was taking such a low dose, but daily. How long can this last for?",5

I hope everybody is doing well!

I just wanted to share my experience with quitting Phenibut, which was sort of an antipole of the plethora of horror stories one might find on this subreddit. This post is definitely not a piece of medical advice, so please consult your doctor!

***Background info*****:** I had been taking Phenibut daily for 5 months (October-February). Started at 1gpd, and eventually made my way up to 2gpd (taking 2.5gpd occasionally). I had been taking the substance mainly due to my Post-Lyme disease nerve pain, which really bothers me in cold weather (mainly autumn and winter - I live in the cold part of Europe, where winters get rather harsh). Where classic OTC painkillers provided me no relief, Phenibut worked like a charm. Even though I am not an anxious person by nature, I liked the added benefit of actually wanting to talk to people and being more social. The only drawback was that I would have to quit eventually - but I had read enough about the Baclofen taper to know, that it would be manageable.

***Getting Baclofen***: I decided to get a Baclofen prescription from my neurologist. First, I told her about the nerve pain I'd been experiencing ever since I had had Lyme disease; which I then connected as to why I had built a dependency on this ""substance"" - which was actually a prescription drug in Russia, but a dietary supplement in the EU (but hey, it helped me alleviate the pain). I then told her I'd need her help in the form of a Baclofen prescription, as there could be severe withdrawal symptoms from Phenibut even when tapering. I also sent her a link to [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604470/), to show her that I was not bullshitting and Baclofen could actually be used to replace Phenibut. She told me she would need a couple of days to study the article, as she had been busy. We also agreed to proceed with some more ""standardised"" treatment of my nerve pain once I'm off Phenibut.

***Beginning of the taper:*** Lo' and behold, she studied the article, gave me a call, and agreed to give me a 50x10mg prescription. As I was going to need it for off-label use, it wasn't covered by my public health insurance, so I ended up paying about €5 at my local pharmacy. In Slovakia, there is just one official manufacturer of Baclofen (from Poland), so the original packaging looked [like this](https://imgur.com/a/KlHhGBC). With the equivalency of *10mg Baclofen = 1g Phenibut* in my mind, on Monday the 1st March, I decided to cut my Phenibut daily dose into a half (1g, and replace the other half with 10mg Baclofen). 

*This is what my initial dosage regimen (Day 1 & Day 2) looked like*

|*8am*|*0.5g Phenibut*|
|:-|:-|
|*12pm*|*0.5g Phenibut*|
|*4pm*|*5mg Baclofen*|
|*8pm*|*5mg Baclofen*|

Baclofen was really strong in the beginning - it had made me dizzy, tired, nauseous and I suffered from diarrhea. Therefore, I am glad I started with 10mgpd only, and that the doses were split. However, the body builds a tolerance to it rather quickly, thus these side effects quickly subsided on the second day. Apart from the slight irritability and feeling neurotic (getting annoyed by my palms being sweaty, feeling like it's a bad hair day, etc.), I did not experience other Phenibut withdrawal symptoms and was feeling great overall. That's why I decided to replace Phenibut with Baclofen completely (impatience might have also played a bit of a role lol).

***The second phase of the taper:*** On day 3, I stopped taking Phenibut altogether, as I felt like my body could handle it. Getting on a higher dose of Baclofen (20mgpd) made the same side effects surface again - and once again they subsided after 2 days. The aforementioned Phenibut withdrawal symptoms remained - when I felt like I needed it, I took an extra 5mg of Baclofen before going to bed (happened only twice). For most of the time, these withdrawal symptoms were hardly noticeable and slowly faded away day by day. As they were practically gone at around Day 9, I knew I had made it.

*This is what my dosage regimen from Day 3 to Day 9 looked like*

|*8am*|*5mg Baclofen*|
|:-|:-|
|*12pm*|*5mg Baclofen*|
|*4pm*|*5mg Baclofen*|
|*8pm*|*5mg Baclofen*|
|11pm (only when needed)|*5mg Baclofen*|

***The last phase of the taper:*** As I felt like I no longer needed to take Baclofen, on Day 10, I decided to decrease my dose to 15mgpd, which was almost painless. On Day 11, I decreased it to 10mgpd. I read that Baclofen can have some withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly, but this was the case for intrathecal administration for long periods of time. On Day 12, I quit Baclofen as well - freedom! Since then, I've been feeling great and I start each day with the thought of not being addicted to anything, which gives me a lot of energy and makes me happy.

***Reflecting on Phenibut***: I think Phenibut is a good servant, but a bad master. Apart from virtually eliminating my nerve pain, it made me absolutely fearless, which I only realised after I had quit. This is good in the short-run (i.e. interviews, dates, etc), but bad in the long-run (i.e. not caring that much about grades, relationships, not planning for worst-case scenarios, etc). I think having a bit of anxiety to push me (e.g. to study harder for an exam) works better for me. However, in the future (after my tolerance disappears - 6 months maybe?), I am planning to make use of the substance once again, this time, very occasionally, e.g. clubbing and interviews.

I was by no means planning on writing such a long post, but oh well here we are!

Feeling good!,"(UPDATE 3/20/22 over ONE YEAR without touching this & I am never looking back!!) Hey guys. Just wanted to document my progress here and share. I think posting here will also help keep me accountable. It’s been 7 days since I’ve touched phen and honestly I feel more like myself than I have in a long time. I can breathe better. I have more energy. I don’t feel so out of it and lethargic. I’m sleeping better. My scary stomach/side pains have disappeared! The insane stomach bloat and water retention is gone! I finally feel good about my body again. I can’t wait to see how I feel in another week, a month, etc! I was doing between 1-3g for about 6 months on and off. I have a gabapentin script which I think has also helped a lot. Taking about 600-1,000 mg split through the day. The first 3-4 days were rough. Drenched in sweat, then shivering and unable to get warm. Insanely tired. Body aches. Shaky hands. Bad anxiety and depression. But I swear on the 5th day things really began to look up! It was like night and day, I couldn’t believe it. I felt surprisingly good from day 5 and on! I’m hoping the worst is over and I’ll just keep feeling better. Good luck to those in a similar position, please reach out if you have questions! We can do this! I plan on updating weekly for a while and then I’ll start updating monthly. 🙏🏼❤️",9

As mentioned in last post(s), I had been taking 750mg of phenibut per day (250mg 3x per day) for about 4 months straight. Decided I didn't want to keep going and dig myself in any deeper so I got some powdered phenibut to taper with. My plan is that I'm going to reduce by 50mg per week until I'm completely off.

Week 1 I knocked off 50mg from my midday dose. This week (week 2), I knocked off another 50mg from my midday dose (so my dosing was 250mg in the morning, 150mg at midday, 250mg at night). Today I was unable to make a 100mg midday dose, so I took 150mg midday and will take 200mg at night but then continue working on eliminating my midday dose tomorrow.

So far, any negative side effects have been very minimal. I've noticed slightly increased depression/anxiety over the past few weeks, but this started before my taper. The past few days I've been meditating and listening to positive affirmations to start/end my days and it's been a huge help. I've been through withdrawal from almost every type of drug before in my life, and in comparison, this has been painless so far (I know I'm going slow, I figure why rush). I almost broke my taper because I took 2 hits of strong LSD this week (wanted to take more to ensure a smooth trip) but told myself I'd have to wait to do any LSD until I was off phenibut if it would fuck with my taper schedule. There's no way in hell I'd feel comfortable doing something like LSD while in any bad form of drug withdrawal.

Anyway, just keeping up with updating. Thanks to everyone who has provided words of encouragement, it makes me feel less alone. Good luck to anyone else trying to get off of phenibut as well!",7

Stayed on 7 for a long, long time. Life happened a year or so later, and I ended up back to 14ish. Whenever I taper down a little bit, the kratom stops working at all. Like, don't feel it at all. This is confusing, because I'm trying to taper on that at the same time. Why don't I feel it? How long, after a respective drop in the daily amount of phenibut, does it take for your body to normalize to that amount so that you can feel kratom again?

(I've read the rules,but I'm not clear on mentioning vendors so I'll try to move around it, and if it's an issue, I'll change it)

I have another issue because I was ordering from nootropics d for a long time, then got one shipment and it was significantly less potent. I quickly ordered from Z Attack, and it was fine. Their 200g was the salt crystals, and their 100g was that fluffy powdery consistency. Then from them, it started to fall off too, so I went back to the previous. How do I maintain the taper if you order it from the same person consistently but the product will fall in potency significantly?

Everyone here posts different methods for quitting. I can't seem to find one standard ""this one works for everyone usually always"" method.

thank you for your help, and good job to those who have quit and those currently on their way out of this hell.",3

The detox i went to was pretty brutal though. They told me before i went in they knew how to treat phenibut with baclofen and that they've done it a few times so I wasn't too nervous. Turns out when i get there no nurse had ever heard of it and the had no clue how to treat it! That made me realize they'd say anything to get my insurance but that's beside the point.

They said they would put me on Phenobarbital so I wouldn't have seizures so i went with it. 2 days in i asked when i would get pheno and they said if i had seizures they'd put me on it. Day 4 and 3 days without sleeping i had 2 seizures and they still wouldn't put me on pheno. They had me on 40mg of valium for the benzo taper and said that will help with my seizures meanwhile I'm detoxing off benzos as well. It was a horrible experience and the staff had no clue what they were doing and the valium didn't touch my benzo or phenibut withdrawal. After 5 days i started feeling a bit better so that's what I'm assuming was when my phenibut withdrawal was getting better. Having the fentanyl withdrawal compound on benzo and phenibut withdrawal was misery and i thought i was going to die so i hopped on suboxone maintenance for the time being. That detox experience is burned into my brain and i kept a journal of everything i went though so if i go to touch it again i can look at that and remember how bad that experience was. I was in the detox for 12 days while they tapered the valium and i ended up being alright with only those 2 seizures. The whole experience was awful though. 

I did a little shy of 3 weeks in rehab and definitely learned a lot. I feel a whole lot better and actually don't have much anxiety at all right now. I know that most likely won't last but I'm going to ride it for as long as i can. The therapist there was really good too she helped me uncover some deep shit that I didn't realize may be causing some anxiety. Now that I'm home I'm trying to live completely sober. My head feels a lot less cloudy which it hasn't been for probably the last 10 years. 

Sorry if this didn't make too much sense, the experience is a little hard for me to put into words. I was on 4g phenibut for over 2 years, 2-4mg of flualp since lockdowns started in march as well as 2-4 (usually 3-4) pressed fetty 30s a day. I feel like a whole new person now. 

Thank you to everyone who gave me words of encouragement on my post before i went. It helped a lot and I'm grateful for you all! There's definitely a life on the other side of this. I forsure will stick around in the community to provide advice and words of encouragement as my predecessors did before me! Stay safe everyone and keep up the hope. We all got this!",35

Woke up drank my supplements, basically some vitamins and minerals with Strattera my med for adhd, capsule of noopept and some l tyrosine and l theanine plus phenibut of course. It got pretty messy few hours later like smaller panic attack which are last few months more or less everyday here but i knew how to handle it and i was like yeah no problem here it goes once again we ll sort this out, but must say it was a bit tougher then usual as phenibut made it slightly worse. Everything in head seemed so overdosed like if my brains could talk their quote would be ""dude we can't work like that that's just too many things i am sorry!"". I gave it to my brother as well to try it, and he felt a bit sick at the beginning so he went back to sleep (as we all took that at about 7.30am morning), but he felt ok later and classically emotional so much that he cried watching some sad videos while taking a dump lmao. Worst part was actually when i took him with car to gym, i've felt so bad and unfocused and kinda sick that i said to him that he should call dad to come pick me up and he will continue to drive to training as he was late, but as i had keys of another car in my jacket he couldn't so i kinda forced myself to be okay and actually got a bit better in couple of minutes (note that this worst part lasted for about an hour or so, it was so bad actually that i really thought i am gonna make car crash or smth as i was driving on highway).

Today day after i feel pretty anxious, so i guess this rebound anxiety is here even though i only took 0.5g (i weight abt 85-86kg so that shouldn't be too much i guess).

I am thinking about flushing it down to toilet, if it's not against the rules i might even ""donate it"" to someone cuz after 2 bad experience in a row i ain't looking for third one... Anyone know anything similar to phenibut? I like this no stress state but this gambling is just not worth it, took it 3x first time it was okay bit dizzy but pretty good, but the other two times were really horrible (second one was actually so bad that i felt dizzy and had horrible palpitations for like 10-14 days haha).

I had probably taken 4 gpd regularly at some point, while the most I’ve have in one day ranges between 6 and 8 gpd. The first time I really quit, I tapered about 100 mg each day, then was able to stay off of phenibut for 28 days with the help of trazodone for sleep. When I relapsed I took 1.5 g and barely get any effects which told me that my tolerance was still pretty high. 

Now I’m off phenibut again with the help of fasoracetam to try to negate the withdrawals. I probably take 5 mg of faso 2 or 3 times a day. I still use trazodone for sleep and am working on getting off that medication. Faso seems to help a lot, but right now I feel really depressed. I’m hoping it’ll go away soon. I’m trying to do regular cardio to help keep my mood up. I’m going to try to keep taking faso for at least around 2 or 3 months so my body can recover faster.

Even though I’m taking a small amount of faso, I still feel some side effects. Faso can slow your heart rate down a little so it can make it harder for me to push myself during workouts, and I’m also more sensitive to the cold. Sometimes i don’t feel as cold, but other times I feel like a freeze baby. I’m still hoping these side effects are just temporary but it’s been 20 days so idk. Rn I’m feeling pretty bummed and unmotivated. Maybe I need some water idk. I’ll just keep trucking through in the meantime and hope for the best.",3

This internship was obligatory for my bachelor degree. Without the Phenibut I wouldn‘t have been able to get through it. I did with a very good certificate thanks to Phenibut.

When I dropped my dose because I aimed to quit after I finished my internship withdrawals hit hard. Depression, anhedonia, social anxiety, restless legs and painful inner unrest.

I just managed to create a stack of supplements which completely vanished my withdrawal symptoms. I tapered down from 7gpd to 3gpd in two weeks and I‘m feeling 100% normal, even better than sober before Phenibut when I already suffered from clinical depression.

To the stack:
* Multivitamin with Zinc, Selen etc.
* Mr. Happy Stack (Omega 3, Uridine 200mg subl., CDP-Choline 250mg)
* Creatine 5g
* Agmatine 3x1g
* NAC 2x1g
* L-Theanine 500mg
* Spirulina x10 (Idk how many mg)
* Methylfolate 1000mcg
* Magnolia Bark x2 (Idk how many mg)
* Inositol 2x3g (up to 12-18g possible)

Maybe this can help some others that well like it does for me. I hope the stack keeps it efficiency for me. I also have baclofen and gabapentin at home but never ever thought about taking one of them because this stack is so effective. As I said it even made me feel better than before starting Phenibut.

I really hope the best for you all. I know the struggle as I already abused and came off Phenibut three times high doses (highest 15gpd) for 2-3 months in my life. This time was the easiest. I continue tapering 250mg every 3 days and don‘t have any problems so far. I‘m 100% normal, even better.

-Of course I want to help you, we’re all in this one together. You aren’t a bother at all.-

For sleep, I always just stayed up, I have insomnia anyway which was a big reason why I first started taking phenibut. I got really friendly with micro naps. But I understand that’s not always practical. So, that’s why I advised chocolate and getting your heart rate up. These help when you do it like 3-4 hours before you want to sleep. I bought a box fan (about $20) and kept it on full blast while I slept. The breeze on my face calms me down. People recommend GABA, but very rarely will it pass through the blood brain barrier so it’s almost a waste of money. (I may be wrong but there are conflicting studies). Also, L theanine and CBD. I like 5-HTP a lot too. They’re very mild and not really habit forming. You can find teas that have both CBD and L theanine in them. Actually, any tea without caffeine is fantastic. You can also take the time to try and lucid dream, I love [Jody Whiteley](https://youtu.be/rEXlScN9AO0), I find her method to be soothing and she has helped me get to sleep many nights. You’re going to have vivid nightmares so it’s best if you can try and control what you can.

Ginger ale/ ginger beer (non alcoholic) because you’re going to have vertigo or nausea for a little bit.

When you get the sweats, take a bath, then run a cold shower over it. So you’ll be sitting in warm water but them you’ll have cold water on your face. Keep a glass of ice water by you if you need more relief. Also, you can heat up a pan on the stove and once it gets hot, take it over to the sink and run cold water on it. This will create a lot of steam and you can inhale it to relieve any pressure in your head.

Stay away from stimulants. Coffee and tobacco are not your friends right now. Take enough, if you already have a habit, to avoid separate withdrawals but that’s it.

The number one thing is you have to stay hydrated and eat well. I mean 64+ ounces of water a day. Get multivitamins if you need. Vitamin C, B complex and good old Vitamin D.

Don’t hesitate to ask more questions.

Edit: This is not medical advice and you should seek professional help if you need to, listen to your body. These are simply things that have helped me through some dark times.",7

Ok. I wasn't measuring out my shit,  just taking massive scoops all day. 
Monday my body started vibrating and not able to sleep,  not one second. 
I feel terrible and it doesn't matter how much or how little I take,  I get the overdose feeling and heart beats out of my chest. Last night I took 3x 3 gram scoops,  hoping I would get just a taste of sleep,  but nothing. 
I don't have any baclofen but I ordered some about a week ago,  so it won't b here for a while.
 In my head I was just gonna keep taking phen until my order came in, but my body is telling me enough,  so I'm gonna listen. 
I ordered gabapentin from a USA pharmacy,   I hope it comes in Friday because I have to go out of town fri night. 
The place doesn't need a script but they write u one and send it for 146$.
 It's better then nothing. I also have some 100 mg gabapentin pills, but I don't know when to take it. 
I don't wana extend the terrible feeling. 
I would rather feel wd then what I have the past 3 days.
 I read it takes 48 to 72 hours for it all to get out,  so I may dose the gaba or just try another 1 gram a phenibut,  just to see if it  lets me get back to sleep,  or feel normal. 
I think since I overdosed -  everythibg I am taking is adding to that, and extending the od. 
I don't plan on sleeping tonight, but I really hope I do,  and that itself gives me anxiety. Should I try and dose 300 mg of gaba later, or should I wait until I am either in wd?  Mabye I'm in wd -I can't tell,  because both feels equally terrible.
 Lmk if I should wait to dose gaba or what?
 There is no way I will take more phenibut,   at least not until late Friday, when I
know its out of my system.
 If any1 has any Xtra baclofen I will do whatever to get it.
 I just want to sleep. 
I feel I'm slowly loosing it, and when I lay down my heart just pounds, and I keep getting shots of adrenaline( or so it feels). 
I guess I'm in psychosis due to lack of sleep,  and my brain chemistry is all messed up. 
All I can do is wait, but I'm supposed to see my daughter this weekend - with her grandma,  and I can't reschedule.
 If any1 has any ideas when to start gaba or something. 
I WILL NOT TAPER OR TAKE ANYMORE PHENIBUT. My body is telling me that any amount would add to the overdose.",1

Just want to post a story with a happy ending in case it helps anyone.  Tl;dr:  5-8g every other day or so for 2 months, 5 day withdrawal w/gabapentin was rough but manageable.  Phenibut withdrawal affects everyone differently and I think I’m a lucky one - maybe you are too.  Don’t let the horror stories here scare you into continuing to use a substance that’s hurting your life - you can taper and you can quit.  Withdrawal was nowhere near as bad for me as the other withdrawals I’ve been through (4 years on heroin and cocaine, suboxone for 4 years, then recently a 2-month cocaine binge).  I just don’t crave phenibut like other drugs, which makes withdrawal much easier.  Fuck, i still crave heroin almost daily and it’s been 12 years.

Long story: I bought some supplements one day hoping to improve anxiety/depression - including a tub of phenibut and some pills.  I took 1 gram phenibut one day, absolutely no effect; 2 grams a few days later, no effect; 2.5 grams a few days later, no effect at all.  I figured it didn’t work on me and I even threw away the tub.  A few months later I tried it again - 3.5 grams.  That felt good.  And because I’m me, I started taking more and more.  

I didn’t track daily use but i went through about 150 grams over 2 months, mostly every other day or every third day but sometimes a few days in a row, 5-8 gpd when i took it.  Decided to stop because I could never take just enough to feel happy and social, I had to keep taking more to try to get really high.  I dosed throughout the day, often 4 or 5 times - 3g in the morning then 1-2g boosts.

When i decided to stop, I kept a little back in case i needed it, b/c of horror stories on here about withdrawal, and also have gabapentin and ambien.  I didn’t end up taking any more phenibut and threw it out today.

Day 1 off phenibut (0-24 hours) - still felt the effects 100%.  Folks call this “afterglow”.  I think the 5.3 hour half-life is wrong - lots of drugs have a longer half-life when taken chronically.  If the half-life was 5.3 hours you wouldn’t still be high the next day.  Slept like a baby.

Day 2 off (24-48 hours) - Felt down and depressed the whole day.  900mg gabapentin midday.  Just a shitty day, not jumping out of my skin.  Took ambien to sleep and i slept through the night.

Day 3 off (72-96 hours) - Terrible day.  Very anxious.  Didn’t want to do anything, didn’t get any work done.  900mg gabapentin in the morning and 600mg in evening.  Ambien to sleep and got maybe 4 hours of sleep.

Day 4 off (96-120 hours) - worst day.  Pins and needles all over my body, disoriented, anxious.  No fast heart rate or chills or anything like that.  Just awful headspace.  Gabapentin 900mg at 8am, 600 mg at 3pm, 900mg at 1am.  Didn’t want to take ambien 3 nights in a row so I tossed and turned and slept maybe 2 hours.

Day 5 (today) - woke up feeling pretty good.  It didn’t last forever and i got very anxious around noon (an hour ago) so took gabapentin 900mg.  Now I’m feeling almost normal.  I worked out - didn’t have tons of energy but endorphins are the shit.  fingers crossed that I’m over the hump and can sleep tonight.  Going to try to taper down gabapentin since 4 days in a row could be its own problem.

Off the phenibut forever - knock on wood.  Hope my story helps.",19

I been on phenibut on and off for 7 months in total and now 4 months(much more on than off) anyway it's been month now that i have done 3g per day and the last week i just tried to do a fast taper. Went from 3g - 1.5g in 5 days then it got to much and relapsed to 3 grams this past weekend and this week so far..

Finally going to get my hands on some baclofen 10mg x 30 but not sure how to use it. 

Read you could just take baclofen and then CT the phenibut but not sure how that would work(not saying it does not but don't understand it) if one is then physical addicted to phenibut how would that help?? 

Also, won't one get seizures if you don't get phenibut but baclofen instead? 

When one comes off baclofen then you won't have any baclofen withdrawals?

How long do you take baclofen to wean off phenibut?

If one takes the slow taper route can one use phenibut and baclofen in the same day?

What time of the day would you take the phenibut and the baclofen?

Any advice would be appreciated, i want to quit phenibut for good.
Thank you",1

Last dose of phen was at 8:30 last night.

Sorry for being so reckless. I have no idea what happened and have already made the decision to stop using phenibut forever, it’s too fucking scary man, I’ve never heard of such an unknown and vaguely understood substance.

So I will finally reach the 2g mark (4 weeks ago still 7gpd). I have 27x10mg baclofen here, I know it‘s not a lot but it might be helpful when I reach the 2g. 2x10mg (20mg) baclofen = 2g phenibut, right?

Is it possible to switch from the 2g directly to 20mg baclofen and then taper that with only 27x10mg baclofen? What would such a taper plan look like? I appreciate every help very much!",0

Even phenibut, I've taken it for weeks and have experience nada when it comes to WD's besides some mild residual anxiety. Mostly, I take Phenibut as long as I want at doses up 3 grams, just to switch to gabapentin and taper done with no problems. That's the past, now I'm doing this with Lyrica without problems. However, now I'm taking Lyrica everyday and at the maximum daily dosage of 200mg 3x/day.

Decided I'm gonna try to taper myself off a daily phenibut habit of 750mg that lasted for about 4 months. I'm gonna be reporting back on here each week with updates in regards to how I'm feeling. My plan is that I will reduce by 50mg each week. I take 250mg when I wake up, 250mg midday, and 250mg before bed. I decided I wanted to try to cut out my midday dose first and then shift my before bed dose to sometime in the evening.

After tapering my 250mg midday dose down to 200mg, after a week I haven't noticed much withdrawal at all. I'm maybe a bit more anxious and depressed than usual, but also I'm not entirely sure this is due to the reduction in phenibut. I've been out of a good routine lately and with quarantine it's been driving me a little crazy.

Anyway, today was my second day with my midday dose reduced to 150mg. I will report back in a week with updates just to help spread knowledge/experience.",7

After quitting kratom after 8 months of daily use that progressed until I was taking 25-35 gpd I ordered 125 grams of phenibut with the intention of taking phenibut for 4 or 5 days to limit withdrawl symptoms. Of course I over did it due to depression and other personal/family issues. I continued to dose daily to get high and forgot all my problems and long story short after 23 days of abuse I'm up to 25gpd. I am prescribed 60 0.5mg klonipin monthly to help with so I should be able to take 3 tablets daily to help me withdrawl safely but honestly from recovered high dose users what am I in for? I had issues with phenibut addiction issues in my past but at my worst I used 250 grams in 30 days and was only up to 12.5 grams daily. Withdrawls were horrible because at the time I only had weed to help and I felt horrible for days and it took me months to recover. Also because of my past phenibut use I picked up a alcohol habit to fill the void phenibut left behind. When I quit last time I quit cold turkey but this time I plan on tapering down 1 gram per day and then stopping.

2021-03-07 22:28:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/m06q8n/quit_phenibut_after_5_years_of_daily_use/,Quit phenibut after 5 years of daily use,"Started taking this stuff in 2015  to be more social and outgoing without the negative side effects of alcohol. Had some prior experience with benzos and was always able to take or leave them. Basically this was a miracle drug for me at first. After a while it's very hard to even feel the effects. My routine was basically 2 scoops in the morning, 2 scoops in the afternoon, 1-2 scoops in the evening for many years. Sometimes slightly more or less but always in the 2-4g a day range

Finally decided I didn't want this for the rest of my life. Started by doing one normal scoop and one slightly smaller one in the morning and kept the rest the same. Every time I would shave a little bit off and then maintain at that dose for a couple days, then shave off a bit more.  I got my daily dose down about half of what it had been then something unexpected happened.

I'd developed a system where  I ALWAYS had a spare container for emergencies and kept two separate stashes in separate locations and basically made sure I always had 2 months supply available incase I was unable to source it again for some reason. In this case I was cutoff from both my stashes.

I was very concerned about side effects from not having the drug. Immediately went to the liqour store and bought a bottle of rum (I never drink) in case of emergency. Went to the store and got some ashwagandha pills aswell since they are said to stimulate GABA. Felt pretty antsy with just the booze, but the ashwagandha thing really helped. I was able to accss my phen again after about a week and by then I no longer needed it.

I have taken phen a couple times after that, just one scoop here and there. I guess sorta to prove to myself that I can take it or leave it like anything else (except nicotine... that's next to go) Don't think I will ever have a problem with it again.

Even though I didn't notice many negative side effects of long term, fairly heavy use from the stuff, it does feel really good to have broke the dependency. It was always on the back of my mind and just a weight on my conscious. I would always get anxious at the airport, no matter how many times they didn't take my tub. I would always make excuses why I quit drinking suddenly (not that that's necessarily a bad thing) and couldn't drink with friends or coworkers. I used to get nightmares sometimes about standing on top of a mountain of the empty tubs or about  being caught without it and being stuck in a bad way.. Turned out that one really did happen and I'm just extremely glad that it happened after I had already started my taper.

Some things I noticed that helped me quit:

(1)Quit any kind of stimulant including caffeine if you use them until your dependence to phenibut is gone.

(2)Quit cannabis until your dependence to phenibut is gone

(3) Ashgawanda . Just take the recommended dose and no more.

(4) L-Thenaine . Just take the recommended dose and no more.

(5) Take it slow if you have to, but try not to go backwards. Since phen has a very long duration, it can be better to think of your dosage as a ""3 day moving average"" try to inch that average down. Every .1 you knock off your daily dose is a step in the right direction.

(6) The tubs I got would lose potency over time because they weren't airtight or light proof. I would get the 250 or 500g tubs and use them down about 90% of the way (usually threw out the last 10% after getting a new tub). The first few doses from the new tub would taste and feel strong.  Hopefully you aren't buying any new tubs, but if you are, try cutting down your dose on that new tub  by a fair amount and see if you can handle it. you might be surprised how much less you need and you can keep your taper going from there.

(7) Excercise can help with the sleepless nights. I ended up going for random 5am runs sometimes to knock myself out when nothing else was working. It can help overall with reducing the stress and ""turning over"" your body chemistry in a sense. I know this isn't scientific but that's been my experience in general for quitting any kind of substances that exercise always helps no matter how shitty it feels at the start. 

Anyway just wanted to share my story since I kept this whole chapter of life to myself over the years, mostly out of shame, and it feels really good to be past it. If anyone else is stuck on this stuff, just know yall can make it through and doesn't have to be in your life forever.",30

2021-03-05 03:42:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ly7nwo/i_fucked_up_i_abused_phenibut_and_kratom/,"I fucked up, I abused Phenibut and Kratom","I already came off Phenibut twice, right now I'm abusing Phenibut daily for the third time. I also suffer from major depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old (today 21). I tried 8 prescribed meds, 2 depth psychological therapies and right now I'm on amitriptyline 100mg at night and in a behavioral therapy. Nothing helped me, meds only gave me sexual side effects but no positive effects on my depression or anxiety. The reason why I abused Phenibut 3 times now. Phenibut was the only thing that had an effect on me, I was functioning and finally able to live at least for some months.

The last time I came off Phenibut was in August 2020. October I started taking kratom daily because it helped with my Phenibut withdrawal symptoms (kratom is very subtle for me so it doesn't do much for social anxiey or depression). Today I'm still on kratom and additionally started taking Phenibut daily again in January. Doses of kratom were 3x4g and since January 3x5g. Phenibut doses were 7g since January.

Yes I'm afraid what to do now and how fucked up I will be after tapering off. I have a side job, a bachelor to finish and soon I'm moving to another country. I know what Phenibut withdrawals feel like and I hate it, without Phenibut I'm getting back to my shy, silent and dumb old me and then as the cherry on the top there are the withdrawals making everything even worse.

I'm sorry for writing here as I wrote many times here. But I need someone to tell me about their success stories maybe with similar high doses. At least it has been ""only"" 2 months Phenibut now so I have to quit it now before it gets worse. I would use Kratom again but Kratom hits me very very subtle unsimilar to people who describe it as euphoric and a buzz. I get 20 min of motivation and probably 1 hour of killing negative thoughts. That's it. And this is a very bad moment for withdrawals as I have to write an exam end of March and work almost everyday in my sidejob.

1. What are your suggestions for me, any tips or experience stories? How were you able to get off Phenibut that high doses? I would appreciate a plan very much!
2. Is there any supplement, nootropic I can take?
3. I know that benzodiazepines, baclofen, gabapentin and pregabalin could help me and I know that I shouldn't use them too long and only to get off Phenibut because they are addicting just like Phenibut and also giving the same horrible withdrawals. The last time I asked 5 docs and no one wanted to give me baclofen. Maybe some trick how I can get one of those from my doc? What would I have to say maybe instead of ""Hey I'm already dependent on GABAergics, so why not give me another one?""? I also think about buying it online but I don't have any clue how this works, how it could be traced and then I live in Germany, I never heard of an online pharmacy here in Germany...
4. Any other things that could help with withdrawing? Especially as I have to study for my exam end of March and work in my sidejob. I already felt the anhedonia and depression yesterday when I took 4g only instead of 7 and it was horrible.

Which of the following supplements I have at home could slightly help?

* Uridine monophosphate
* Mucuna Pruriens
* Spirulina
* Nicotinamide / Niacine
* Red Maca
* Magnolia Bark
* Creatine
* Beta Alanine

I already take multivitamin and fish oil. And I'm on this tricyclic antidepressant which acts on Serotonine, Noradrenaline and others. But I don't get any effects from it.

BIG BIG LOVE for reading until here. I really need this thread to stay sane after going crazy at work or social events because of withdrawing and getting back to my old weaker me. ",5

All the others didnt do much but after taking beta-alanine and taurine after while i was feeling a lot better, im still little depressed but I would say Im feeling 80% better than before taking these two supplements.

I dont know how do they work or if they will help you but i wanted to share that with you, and I hope that they will help, I dont know what would I do if i didnt found them.

I took around 5g of Beta-alanine, and 3g of taurine, my body started to tingle and burn a little bit, it was wery unpleasant but after a hour i was super relieved and tingeling stopped.

My head also feels a little more clear now. I don’t feel great by any means, but I’m feeling better now.

I’d been taking phenibut since last July, and the highest dosage I had taken had been around 6 g. I had been on and off it a lot when I was first starting to quit. And did a taper the first time I quit. I was able to stay off it for 28 days, only taking trazodone, prescribed from my doctor, to help me sleep. However I relapsed and took 1.5 g of phenibut. Even though it had been almost a month since my last dose, the 1.5 g that used to practically send me to heaven, hardly did anything at that point. Which told me that I was no where near full recovery. 

Now that I’m on faso, I do feel better than the last time I quit, but I tend to feel more anxious before I take it after waking up, so I’m not sure if it’s really speeding up the recovery process.

Do some of you get tight jaw and trouble speaking even taking high doses that is not meant to taper. It's hard to speak but it's not cause my words are slurring but more that i can't speak??

Even when i taper and take 1g  still battle to speak to people, weird and hate it. ok so back to my taper plan..

I been on phenibut on and off for 3 months(much more on than off) anyway it's been 3 weeks now that i have done 3g per day and the last week i just tried to do a fast taper. Went from 3g - 1.5g in 5 days and then stopped.

I felt a little shitty and little anxious but not so much but been sneezing and my nose is running all day. I did 2.5grams yesterday and so today i thought i need to go to a dose were my nose does not run at it's lowest and start tapering from there and just do a fast tapper as well, since i have only been on it a few months and 3 weeks everyday now.

I want to start at 2g today and then see if my nose still stops running and then 1.5g and see how i feel till i get that spot were i find my nose starts running and then tapper from there.

Any idea's will this work?

also..

I have Agmatine sulphate but it does not help me but maybe i take it wrong so when should i take this and how much? I take 30mg cymbalta so not to much cause i am scared of serotonin syndrome.

I have taken 500mg before taking phenibut but does nothing for me. 

So got NAC as well so when do i take NAC before or after phenibut.

Yesterday I felt a little low on mood, but I’ve come to expect that when I take phenibut in 1+ gram doses for more than 3 days. This time I took around 1-3.5 grams each day about twice a day for 4 days. This is pure hell. I’m an anxious person by nature, but I VERY RARELY ever have panic attacks, and all day has been essentially one continuous panic attack, not to mention the depression and feeing of being isolated from everyone else. My heart is pounding out of my chest, I am getting super stressed about really small things that normally I wouldn’t, and oh my god I can’t sleep at all. I’m taking l-theanine, magnesium, and nac currently, which all work to a certain extent but fuck this drug. I’m done with it for good this time.",2

hi yall, i'm an addict in recovery and ive been down this road before and i dont know why the hell i decided to go down it again, i relapsed on phen. i got my 60ct of 250mg pills almost a week ago and i have 8 left. i took around 2 grams a day for a little less than one week. i'm not ordering more because fedex is blocked up and by the time it gets here i'll be off of it. thinking about doing a fast taper, i cant get baclofen because my doctor won't give me what i want - very stubborn. i take 600mg of gabapentin a day that is dosed out by my parents (i'm 20 but have a history of gabapentin abuse) so i cant take more or increase my dose. i know what i did was stupid but would 500 mg for 3 days then 250 mg for 2 days be a good taper? any advice on supplements i can get at the store? i have loads of cbd with GABA in it as well. also does this show up as a false positive on drug tests? please help! anything helps! the horror stories are freaking me out. thank u.",1

That's par for the course. I took a nap and woke up to her screaming bloody murder, wouldn't respond to anything, looked like she didn't know where she was. Eventually she fell back asleep

I checked the tub and it was unopened before she opened it, and there's only 75 grams in it. This was a 125 gram tub. She would have taken it about 8 hours ago. She occasionally wakes up and screams more and then falls back asleep. Her breathing is stable. I think she did this on purpose. 

This is a fucking nightmare",29

But it helps when i take a small dose of phenibut about once a week.

I only took 0.6 grams every other day to avoid addiction. I did this for probably 4 years. I decided to stop because i couldn’t walk for more than about 8000 steps a day without being extremely exhausted the day after. So i got worried and thought that phenibut might had caused it.
Well, now im of it and damn my legs are so sore i had to go to the doctor. I hope it soon will be better.
Also, i have insomnia.

Anyone with the same experience?

Thank you for reading.

EDIT: forgot to write that i had used it for about Four years.",7

Expecting w/d when it’s gone and my binge is over. What can I expect? Is it unrealistic to manage a habit with this stuff? Is it best to just leave it alone?,"I do enjoy this stuff, sort of reminds me of kratom, which I struggled with years ago, But the last thing I want to do is get involved in another dependency battle.

What are the adverse health effects from this substance? I ordered mine from a reputable supplement dispensary.

Really appreciate this forum and everybody’s input, feedback, and assistance. Looking for brutal honest answers.",1

I was thinking a quick 5 day taper might be a little extreme because I didn’t have a daily habit but I was wondering if you guys had advice on what I should do? I take red kratom every now and then and smoke/vape a bit of weed habitually",2
