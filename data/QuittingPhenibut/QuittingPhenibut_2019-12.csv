I quit a daily kratom habit of about a year and a 1 or 2 month phenibut habit cold turkey last year during this time. It was about 3 - 5 months of absolute hell, non stop anxiety and dread. I was sleeping maybe 4 hours every 2 or 3 days with no end in site it seemed, went to 3 different doctors and nothing helped they just wrote me off as a drug addict. Felt like ending my life. Then I developed this thing where just as I was about to transition to sleep my body would jolt and my legs would fly up in the air waking me back up. That's all past me now and I am happy to say that I am 100% back to normal and off both substances. But the insomnia almost killed me. I nearly lost my job, and I basically lost my sanity for a bit. I could not eat, sleep, eat or even go to the bathroom. I felt like walking death. It just wasn't getting any better.",6

My average dose of phen was 8-9/gpd for 2 months. I'm tapering at 0.5g/day. 

I have gone through heroin/opiate withdrawal. I was a heroin addict for 4 years, and have been sober from it for 6 years, taking 6 mg. of Suboxone per day.

I have done some research on supplements that can help with the phenibut withdrawal, but I'm having a hard time finding a good dosage amount, and how often one should take them throughout the day. 

If anyone would be willing to take the time to answer my questions, it would be greatly appreciated. I thought maybe this would also be helpful for others who are weening to have this info in one thread.

A.) Recommend the amount I should take of each supplement listed below.

B.) The frequency I should take them (for example, if I should take 40 mg. of Fasoracetam in the a.m. when I wake up, and take the same dose again 8 hours later). 


1.) Fasoracetam - 20mg. Capsules, 30 count

2.) L-Theanine - 200 mg. Capsules, 90 count

3.) Lemon Balm Tablets - 500 mg. Tablets, 60 count

4.) Magnesium Glycinate Capsules - 800 mg. Capsules, 180 count

5.) 1/2 lb. Kava Root Powder 

6.) Gotu Kola - 435 mg. Capsules, 60 count

7.) Beta Alanine - 750 mg. Capsules, 120 count

2019-12-28 21:42:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/eh0c1e/my_quitting_experience/,My quitting experience,"So as of now I am down to 1 gram. 4months ago I was up to 6 to 7 grams per day. I used 2 capsules every three hours except for the 5 or 6 hours while I was sleeping. I had tried to quit when I was up around 1 1/2 grams cold turkey and had horrific withdrawals. I am a former opiate addict so I am very familiar with tough withdrawals, but this was another level. 

My phenibut use got to where I couldn't effectively carry out my day because the energy I used to get had turned into massive fatigue. I spoke with my psychiatrist and explained to him that I wanted to quit but was terrified of the withdrawals again. He wrote me a prescription of gabapentin (nuerotin) and told me to start by skipping 2 doses and replacing it with gabapentin. I tried that and it really made it worse. My Dr suggested pouring out half of gabapentin capsule. This worked like a charm. I slowly tapered down over 4 months to where I am currently only taking 1 gram a day. I have tried going to just gabapentin and not taking any phenibut and I do not feel withdrawals like before, but my mood is extremely flat and I almost feel depressed. I guess that is normal when you screw with your gaba receptors.  So now I am slowly coming down the last gram.

Words of advice: since not alot of information is known about this, it is difficult to give exact measurements of how much your taking to counter the gabapentin/phenibut ratio. It is important to pay attention to how you feel and ignore the goblins that try to get you to take a little more to feel good. This is an addictive substance and all the rules of overcoming an addiction 100% apply here. By doing this the way I have done this I was able to avoid any serious withdrawals. In fact I felt no discomfort what so ever. Which is amazing because anyone who has ever tried to quit phenibut knows that this as close to hell as you can get.

I am worried about how screwed up my gaba receptors are and if I will have a permanent depression diagnosis because of it. Just be careful and be strong. Phenibut is evil stuff.",11

For me at least. 

Quick backstory:

In 2014 through 2017 I would take anywhere from 1 gram up to 3.5 grams of Phenibut anywhere from once a month to 5 days a week. 2015 being my heaviest usage.

I wouldn't use daily because after the first year or so, the emotional part of the crash started to show and became almost unbearable. 2 days after dosing I would have enormous depression (which I already experience anyway but more or less acutely in comparison) that would last several days and that would make it tempting to dose again... Sometimes I did, but I learned eventually to wait, as I knew it wouldn't help in the grand scheme of things...

Flash forward:

I recently got some phenibut again figuring that more than a year would have probably been long enough for my receptors to re-adjust and maybe not have such a bad crash (since I didn't have it in the beginning). So, I took a gram of phenibut for a date with the lady friend that night. It worked decently. Not feeling extreamly ""phennied"", but had a nice flow going and my pupils weren't very dialated (which was good as I wanted to avoid that). The next day I was glowing pretty hard as well. Felt great in fact. Felt I had rediscovered something I loved so much and hopped I may be able to use it again as a very occasional tool...

The day after... **Holy fucking shit**. My friends, it doesn't change [in my case]. It was probably **worse** than before actually. I was crippled with tremendous amounts of [worse than normal] depression and some anxiety that latched on and lingered for almost a week... From a gram! 

I'm not a scientist, but between my years of phenibut abuse (and other drugs I've abused I'm sure), I did a number to my brain/receptors. I don't think I'll ever touch the stuff again. Its just **not** worth it... I mean MDMA or other drugs don't have the emotional/psychological crash or hangover that phenibut has for me... 

(If anyone is a great drug nerd and may be able to help me understand why a bit better that'd be neat)

I'm just sharing my experience. I could probably add more, but not really needed. I'm also not really going to tell others how to live, however if you have been off the stuff for a while and dealt with the emotional crashes from it in the past, and think one day you may be able to do it again; perhaps reconsider. Unless you're feeling like you can hang.... I thought I could, I still low-key expected it in fact. Just not to the degree that I had it. I know phenibut wasn't the sole reason for my gloom, but holy shit did it potentiate it... If I didn't have a therapist and good support from family and friends, it would have a been an even darker experience...

All the luck to you out there. Stay strong and my advice would be to not break to your urges cause you're feeling okay now. But I'm not your mom or dad so do you. ✌",8

In the beginning, I didn't feel any effects at doses like 0,5g or even 1g and forgot about this substance. One day(about June 2019) I took about 4g before bed and woke up feeling super rested and positive. I started using phenibut before every party or when I couldn't sleep. I got hooked since July/August 2019. I was using doses from 3-4g daily and 6-8g before events.   

Even though phenibut was making me super calm and positive, I was feeling sick in my body. It was a couple of times when I forgot to take my doses and experience withdrawal. I realize that I was physically dependent. I was making a couple of attempts to taper but always relapse because of big events and keep to continue the cycle. 

I go for a New Years' Eve to a different country by plane on 29.12.2019. I tapered down to 1,5g day in the first week of December, but then again relapsed before the big event and go whole week by 5g a day. On 16.12.2019 I decided to go cold turkey. I was thinking that maybe it's will be horrible, but i will survive and it's better to experience full intense withdrawal now and be ok at new Year's eve.

Withdrawals started 24h after last dose (3g). I couldn't sleep because of restless energy and a racing heart. I go to work and at 36-hour mark i was thinking that i will go insane.  I thought that i was having a panic attack. I couldn't sit, I was feeling like alien, weird energy moving through my body, intense agitation and sweet. It was so bad that I wanted to go to the ER. I go to the bathroom to vomit and calm down. After 15 minutes i calmed down and got back to work. I was feeling very tired but quite calm. After work i go to the gym, thinking that making myself even more tired, will allow me to sleep. I go to bed 48h after the last dose. The heart was racing super fast and feelings of being doomed to the life of misery and hopelessness overwhelmed me. At the 52h mark, desperate to sleep I took 7g. I sleep maybe 3 hours.  

After experiencing all of this, I decided to do a quick taper. One dose 2 hours before bed as follows: 2g - 1.5g - 1g - 0.8g - 0.5g - 0.3g - 0.3g and 0.2g today. First, 3 days was very challenging but manageable. The biggest problem was a trouble to go to sleep, because of racing heart and agitation, anxiety wasn't as much a problem. For 3 days I'm feeling as good as before starting phenibut always getting at least 8h of sleep, with occasional irritation and a mildly faster heartbeat. I plan to quit tomorrow.

For the whole taper, i was using daily: magnesium, l-theanine, lithium, and melatonin. I think that being stress-free from work and able to sleep on my own schedule was the real game-changer. 

I don't want to promote reckless quick tapering, just share my story. Hope I will quit forever tommorow.

So it's been a little while since my last post, and I figured I'd write a quick update. 

I had tried a rapid taper from 12 - 14 GPD, and I made it down to about 4 grams a day. My supply was getting low, and I was pretty nervous about the jump. Unfortunately, I have no willpower and ended up stuck at 4 GPD until my supply ran out.

I opted to cross my fingers and CT from that dose and I'm happy to say that it wasn't bad at all. I'm now more than a week completely sober. 

My anxiety levels were a little higher than usual and I had some trouble sleeping but overall it was relatively painless. I still slept 6 to 7 hours per night, and I didn't have anything that could qualify as a panic attack the whole time. 

At this stage, I feel pretty normal. The only thing I miss phenibut for is exercise, because it turned me into a workout beast. Now I'm struggling with endurance, but it's a small price to pay to not be a slave to that stuff anymore.

I'd like to say I could start using it responsibly but I know that's not true so I'm done with phenibut for good.

Anyway, I guess I just want people to know that it's possible for some people to come back from months of high doses relatively painlessly. That said, experiment with quitting at your own pace, as everyone's individual experiences will vary.

Good luck everyone!",19

That would really suck. Alcohols not an option any more. Been 46? Days since I drank. Mainly because last time I did I broke my neck and I’ve been in a neck brace ever since. Anyways since all I do is lay around and watch tv all day I figured what better time to kick this shit. It’s been almost a year on this shit and I had some good times. Also did a lot of damage tho. The magical months were bad ass but spent in a fukin stupor and fake as shit. Started tapering down from 14 gpd few months ago and as of today I’m at 1 gram per day homies. I was able to make huge drops from such a high daily usage amount and then kinda chilled and dropped slower. If u go back thru my postings u will see I was all over the fukin place in.my head for a while. But I can tell u almost alllllll of it was fear of what was going to happen but never did. I did have one bad fukin panic attack when I ran out for 3-4 days when I was taking a lot. Lmao it was bad. Then there was a month or two where I was drinking ALOT so it was easy to drop. Anyways I was gonna wait till the first to stop but I’m gonna take one more dose of one gram tomorw morning then I’m locking the shit up and storing it up in the top of the closet with the sex toys we never use.

I seriously don't know what to do.,"Hey guys. Sorry if this post is similar to one I made two or three weeks ago. It's a similar predicament, but slightly different.

As the title implies, phenibut just no longer makes me feel normal, and I seriously don't know what to do about it.

So I've been taking 15g/day. I used to take that as 5g during the day and 10g at night, and that worked great. Kinda felt bad during the day, but it was whatever, I'm a NEET with no friends so it's not like I do anything during the day. At night I felt awesome, I'd just turn on some music and feel great.

Now, it seems, no amount of phenibut makes me feel good or even normal. Honestly it just makes me feel terrible every time I take a dose.

Like today, I took 7.5g this morning, because I figured I'd take 7.5 twice a day. 2-3 hours after the dose and I felt like garbage. I don't totally even know how to describe the feeling. It's not a withdrawal feeling, it just feels... Bad. Like, I get super depressed and feel this weird 'energy' going through my body. I spent pretty much the whole morning crying and contemplating suicide. I haven't slept in 2 days.

This started happening after I accidentally messed up my dose one day. I think I accidentally dropped my dose by 5g for 2 days, and I was in hell for almost a week. Once I 'stabilized', I felt better, but phenibut just never felt the same.

I also had to c/t my ~70ish g/day kratom habit a couple days ago, which is just making everything 100x worse. Not only does phenibut not work and make me feel like trash now, but I gotta deal with kratom withdrawal on top of that! I don't think that's the reason this is happening, though, as phenibut making me feel horrible went back before I quit kratom.

I don't see how I'm ever gonna be able to taper if I already feel horrible at my starting dose. If I could just get back to my 5/10 schedule and have it actually feel good, I'd be able to, but it just makes me feel bad. I haven't gone higher than 7.5g at once so far because I'm afraid of how awful 10g could possibly make me feel.

I seriously think I've trapped myself in a hole that I can't get out of, guys. I don't see any way out of this anymore. Everything has just gotten out of control so fast, and I just want out. I really think I'm done for at this point.

Anyway, back to what I was saying, has anyone else else experienced anything like this? Do you have any advice? I just wanna get back to my old dosing schedule so I can feel normal again and start tapering. Again, this feeling is NOT withdrawal, it's something weird and different.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",3

However cannot really claim full sobriety because I’ve been addicted to kratom for the past 4 years (35-60 gpd) depending on the year months etc. Nonethless consistent user. Then when that lost its luster I found this wonderful white powder called Phenibut, which magically steeped right into those receptors that had been starved from alcohol for the time listed above. Consistently using 8-15 gpd for a year. So here over the last 6 months (I know-I’m a slow learner, and generally have to relearn it over and over again) I’ve committed to myself that I have a substance abuse problem with two chemicals I’ve become dependent on. I’ve tried C/T, I’ve tried tapering, no dice. Call it a lack of will power, a complete wuss when it comes to withdrawal symptoms, or maybe some deeper rooted dependency issues. I pray and pray and pray (to the atheists and agnostics this is not to offend, just my story). I have a therapist, an amazing sponsor in AA, a wonderful wife and baby. But wtf gets me to have the audacity to spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars over the years supporting this habit-please don’t get into the financial aspect of my addictions. But I work for my money, and self made. SO anyway, I stand at a crossroads, or rather a roundabout with multiple different directions to go...IOP?Rehab?Addiction Counselor?try c/t or tapering again?a sympathetic pcp? My mind spins as to how to go about it. I feel ridiculous...getting hooked onto Phenibut AND Kratom. To the point where I am dependent, not like oh I’ll feel better in a day or two, but like in that super bad way that few of us do to come to the realization that we can no longer live with it or without it. I finally come clean with my wife, I express my remorse and tell her to the best of her understanding my addictions to two substances she has NO freaking clue what they are. Her not having an allergy to alcohol, nor any sort of dependency issues has no clue what I’m talking about, and of course answers-well just stop taking it...haha I WISH! Nonetheless she is supportive and says do what you need to do. Weeks go by, my consumption starts going up higher and higher. How am I to talk to people, be in social situations, relax at night, sleep all night, have super energy during the day etc etc. All the chemical properties I thought were helping me be happier, healthier, stronger, better at everything. They all work wonderfully until they don’t right? So like I said I go weeks and weeks watching my consumption sky rocket to new highs. Waking up feel so “Phenibut” hangover I wonder how I’m going to work for the day, ohhhhh wait, there’s Kratom to pick me up! Back on my toes and ready to go. Now to get back onto the topic, how am I supposed to explain to anybody in the medical field that I am in big trouble and cannot just stop taking these two drugs. Hardly anyone has heard of these, even in the recovery field. Probably more Kratom if anything since it’s grown so popular. But nonetheless I’m petrified about what to do, I talk to my therapist,  come totally clean about it, tell him I can’t stop taking it. Just by the stroke of luck I have a simple follow up with my personal physician this same day in the afternoon. After working through some of the typical therapist stuff etc etc he tells me, “you need to tell your doctor,today, this afternoon.” I chuckled, thinking he’s crazy. Like my nice little hometown physician assistant is going to know anything I’m talking about, I tell him my apprehensions, he says what’s the worst that could happen? Your not on anything that’s regulated or illegal, your being open and honest and don’t know what to do. You may be surprised. So with much apprehension I find myself in the doctors room, sweating and fearful about what she’ll say...the usual soft knock on the door comes and she enters and I just LOSE it, like total ugly crying, not even making cohesive words or sentences. Caught off guard and getting me some tissues, she calms me down and simply asks what is it? Calming down I tell her I’ve become addicted to some drugs. She is kind of taken back. She says which drugs? I say Phenibut and Kratom. She nods her head...then says huh?! Haha she’s like what the hell are those? So I spell both of them out for her. She admits to her relief, that she thought I was going to say meth or heroine. Which nothing against anybody that uses any of that, an addict is an addict and a drunk is a drunk. And I am both of those! She researches the impending doom in my head as to what we’ll have to do-rehab, send me away for a month-90 days etc. She simply explains the receptors that both of those are hitting, and comes up with a plan. I’m already on an SSRI and a benzo so I have that going for me. But she decides to add GABA to the mix. I know all the things that people are probably going to throw some hate at me for. So fast forward 5 days and here I am. No pheni, no Kratom, but all the prescribed concoctions to help me get through the WDs...I am not going to put a badge on like some of you brave souls! Gone cold turkey no crutch! I look up to you and am amazed how strong you are. Reading through some of those threads really have given me hope. The gaba won’t last forever, it’s still not a walk in the park trying to come straight off pheni and Kratom after the ridiculously stupid high doses I was taking. I still get the dreaded RLS, impending doom, self loathing, feeling like the biggest piece of crap...which I’m sure there will be plenty of you to throw a couple more scoops on top of that but whatever. To each their own, I was just really compelled to tell my story this evening. I can’t do anything about tomorrow, I just have to hold on to whatever I can to never take a drink, take Kratom or Phenibut again. If you made it all the way to hear, thanks for reading!",11

I’ve been a lurker here for a long time but I have finally decided enough is enough and started tapering, I have been on phenibut for over 2 years straight on sleepwalkers and before that I was taking kchill shots 2015-2016 daily and I didn’t even know it has phenibut!

I bought some regular phenibut and am now on 1.5g daily. 1g in the am and 500mg at about 3. I strangely enough don’t develop a tolerance to that amount and seem to keep the magic but it’s gotta end sometime....

8 days ago I started tapering, My plan was to cut 50mg every 3 days until it’s done. I made it today (at 1350mg) and caved and took another 250mg on top of that (so 1600mg). So disappointed in myself. I feel like the tingling, hot cold issues, and anxiety has been too
Much. It’s very physical withdrawals. 

My question is this, is there a better way? Should I be in withdrawal that much with this taper? And tomorrow can I go back to 1350mg? I want to feel good without the need for a substance, I have a long history with drugs and it’s time for sobriety, Thank you!",2
2019-12-23 17:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/eerbby/always_keep_a_log/,Always keep a log,"I have a text file on my computer because I'm on it whenever I'm home. Other people use their smartphone but whatever works for you. You cant be lazy or ashamed if you didn't make it as far as you wanted to before taking another dose. I noticed that some days if I were busy or had a lot going on that I wouldn't update my log every single time I took a dose, trusting myself that I obviously knew I did. And, I never had a problem until recently.

There were 2 occasions that I couldn't remember if I dosed, one where I had to wake up to take my dose then go back to bed because I had work some hours later and i'll explain what happened further down this post. I was in a groggy state from benadryl and melatonin and woke up just to dose. A large dose of melatonin works like a charm during taper; it can knock me out even if I'm on the tail end of my last dose even 1 hour before my final dose that 24hr period to stay asleep and/or start the day after waking until lunch time. Actual lunch 2 hours after phenibut of course smh. I be hungry as f sometimes too, it's very frustrating to have to time your meals around it esp if youre at work. Thankfully I work at a restaurant.

I take 20mg of melatonin but I'm thinking about trying 15mg because I fall asleep in my chair for an hour or two. No big deal except one time recently, my arm was hanging over the arm rest and it cut off my radial nerve above my elbow. This makes your hand numb and not work as if you slept on it except it never thaws out all the way and it took 4 days to regain function in my fingers and thumb all the way. It can take longer. When I used to take kratom extract last year, I nodded out for a long time and my hand was limp for a month. Thankfully I didn't have or need a job but nowadays that's unacceptable.

Anyway, one other time when I was busy getting ready for work in a rush so I wouldnt be late. I counted out and put the dose away that I take with me for 8hrs later at work or getting off but for the life of me couldnt remember if I took my actual dose minutes beforehand. Cant risk double dosing before work or going out so I had to go with extreme anxiety playing it through my head. A couple hours later, I convinced myself I never took it because of the anxiety and took my dose for later much earlier. The world may never know if I missed the dose or not but I felt like I actually had taken it when the next one kicked in because it hit extra hard, at work no less.

The one in the middle of the night was similar. I laid back down but woke up wondering about it an hour later like, ""Did I even take it? I was so out of it"" and got really shitty sleep, which convinced me I hadn't taken it. So, I jumped the gun and took my pre-work dose earlier than usual a few hours later because I was terrified of messing my levels up and being at work with symptoms. Still don't know if I missed that dose or not.

So now, I force myself to type it in when I take it no matter what. The one I take when I'm at work or getting off I write in when I get home but I know I didn't miss it because it's all I had on me. It's absolutely terrifying and will make you mess up your taper.",5

Lol, it's hard to explain. Let's say the previous is wearing off on schedule and it's time for the next. Wouldn't the new, reduced dose raise the level of phenibut higher than it was an hour before you took it? You take 3g 3x a day and you're reducing the 3rd dose of the day. You make some kind of reasonable reduction. The new, reduced dose taken on schedule shouldn't come with any immediate WD symptoms that you'd notice immediately, right? For the first few hours at least it would work better than it was shortly before taking it even though it's reduced so it's a bit less?

Logic would say it'd be impossible to feel WD symptoms right away because the new dose starting to work would be stronger than the tail end of the previous, slightly large dose. I'm trying to figure out if it's just anxiety and paranoia over getting symptoms or if they start to happen that quickly. If they do, can you explain why? It doesn't seem like it'd make sense.",1

First two months I was taking 14 grams every single day. The high was AMZING and I swear it felt almost as good as any opiates I’ve ever had and they were my true love for a decade. I would literally set up allllll night long fighting sleep and nodding out dropping cigarettes. I lost a good job from this. That’s ok because I just don’t regret any thing I e ever done because it takes what it takes. 
             I only knew it was 14 because my wife and I would split an oz every single fukin day right down the middle. You guys convinced me I needed a scale to ever start thinking of kicking this shit. During that time I ran out for 4 days once and had worse panic attack Ive ever had in my life. I literally dropped my drywall harness and drove 45 minutes to get 2 Xanax bars and I stayed drunk for 3 days in my bedroom trying to shake the memory of what happened. 
I know it sounds weird but I had to drive myself and told my buddy to ride shotgun because it was so bad if I wasn’t driving I was scared I might jump out of the car because I was losing my mind. 
             Like a lot of people say dropping huge amounts when your dosing that amount every day is easy and it was. I dropped to ten immediately and felt no different. Since then I’ve been tapering down a gram at a time and it’s been pretty smooth. 
       So I got down to 8gpd and stayed there for a month Because some personal shit I was going thru put the taper on hold. 2 months ago I dropped to 6 gpd and all was good. 
         On November 8th I rolled my Durango 3 times and broke my neck. They had me in a coma for 4 days because my spine was 1cm away from bone fragments and they couldn’t risk me moving it for fear of being paralyzed. I actually had no wd from phenibut when I came out. My opinion is the shit they use to keep in coma occupied that part that phenibut feels. So when I finally came home I resumed my schedule of 2 grams 3 times a day. 
              Then recently I ran out for 3 days. What’s weird is I didn’t have any huge anxiety or anything but more of that weird gritty feeling of touching back down similar to Xanax wd. I finally got it last night and Ive only taken 2 grams today. I have 8 bars so that’s my ace in the hole and I know I’ll end up needing them. I put 5 away and won’t touch them until I need them after I’m done. I’m gonna take 2grams a day till Wednesday then drop to one gram a day after Wednesday. Im off work another month so what better time to kick this shit and stay in bed under the blanket. Lmao 
           I’m doing 1 gram day after that and then January 1st I’m done with this BULLSHIT. Don’t give up guys, fuck this shit.",6

A week or two ago, I had called my insurance and asked them about addiction specialists that my insurance covered. They told me that, for that kind of thing, I'd need to go to my primary care provider and get a referral. So yesterday, I did just that.

My doctor wasn't sure exactly who to send me to, so she printed out a list of addiction specialists in my area and told me to just find one that worked for me and call her so she could send in the referral.

Well, I looked through all the clinics on the list, and every single one seems to just be focused on Suboxone! I live in a rural area that's 20 minutes away from a small city, so I'm starting to get nervous that none of the clinics around here are gonna know what to do. I remember when I was withdrawing from benzos, even then, I had gone to a couple different clinics and they all said that they didn't really work with benzo addicts.

So, as the title says: If you have seen/are seeing a doctor for your phenibut taper, what kind of doctor is it, and how did you find them?

It was starting to ""lose it's magic"" but then one day it stopped working completely. Not only that but after trying higher doses it sent me into horrible withdrawals. And then not only that that but **I couldn't get rid of them no matter the dose!!** 

So long story short it has ruined prolonged moments of the better part of this year and the moments that I did enjoy honestly during most of them I was likely high on lyrica. 

So I did try rehab (then I was using 1gpd of lyrica) in supposedly a very good rehab/treatment facility belonging to a hospital. The nurse explained to me that they will put me on drip infusion, put me to sleep for a day or so and then (supposedly) numb the wd symptoms with diazepam+quatepine. 

Well that sleep thing didn't really work - I wasn't asleep for long at all and they were giving me absurd amount of diazepam (6pills of 5mg x 4 per day) which obviously got rid of the anxiety but nothing else. \*I was previously addicted to xanax and had the tolerance, they knew about that.\* 

Soon enough that horrendous anhedonia and depression (once you feel it you start to understand than anxiety is not the worst feeling in the world) got so bad that instead of trying to argue with them I straight out signed out, went home, took maybe 600mg of lyrica and after some sleep was feeling MUCH better. I mean coming from highly unbearable to easily comfortable (""maybe life is not so bad after all"" kind of feeling).

So yeah, after getting a decent doctor I was functioning on lyrica just shy of 1g + 2mg clonazepam but there were moments where I was feeling so bad I couldn't help myself but to take more lyrica (that feeling where you would do ""anything"" just to feel better). The tipping factor was probably my baseline to begin with which I wasn't exactly comfortable to begin with and wasn't really sure where it was anymore. 

I did try things which I rather not mention by name as this is kind of my main reddit account (with auto-login). I must admit they helped tremendously on gaining perspective on life and learning things about myself I didn't know before. But the chemical part remained. It's a substance addiction after all and not something driven by mind like PTSD. 

So here I am taking 2gpd of lyrica to function daily. Obviously what lead to this was my baseline mildish depresion and anxiety + phenibut messing me up + bad treatment + possibly some lack of control on my behalf (although I can't imagine someone going through this without increasing lyrica or binge drinking or things like that).

At this point some kind of rehab is becoming simply inevitable as my situation is so fucked up I don't even want to think about it. Meaning I'm living by the moment enjoying what I can but I'm not blind and not ignoring anything. 

So I guess I'm posting this to let others know just how bad phenibut can really mess you up even if at first it may look likeit's  a miracle supplement. I swear I thought I was totally immune to wds and potential risks where blown out of proportion. Which now sounds silly, obviously.",1

SEE A DOCTOR ASAP 

Hey everyone, i just want  to share some of my experience with phenibut taper and maybe give some poeple hope that recovery is possible even from extreme abuse.

I had been abusing phenibut daily for 2 years when I decided to start tapering, in that timeframe ive never been off phenibut for more then a day at most. I started with doses of 1.5 grams daily and escalated my dose until I hit around 6-10 grams daily. This habit has been very costly and the phenibut didnt even have any effect except starving off withdrawals.

2 months ago I started to dose more inconsistently around 2-3 times a day with teaspoons full of phenibut, my estimate is  at least 6-10 grams daily. I started getting interdose withdrawals constantly because of the inconsistent dosing, causing insomnia, panic attacks, nausea, vertigo, nerve pain and severe numbness in my body. When these symptoms started , I was of course very worried but didnt attribute it to phenibut yet. I went to my doctor and got blood tests done, turns out all my blood values were completely normal.

I ended up increasing my phenibut dosage in desperation to feel okay and felt mostly normal for a week until the withdrawals came back. Desperate for solutions I found a thread that stressed consistent daily dosing. Which I started at 6 grams per day at 6pm. After a few days my withdrawal symptoms stabilized but I was still mostly miserable, dizzy and had horrible nerve pain. I decided to start tapering at 200-300mg per day, which was exhausting at first but my symptoms did not increase or decrease in severity. (This is a very fast taper and absolutely not recommended!)

Once I hit 3 grams per day my withdrawal symptoms mostly stopped, the nerve pain, numbness, panic, vertigo and dizzyness are completely gone, only depression persists. Right now im at 2 grams per day and feeling pretty decent.  I will continue my taper at the 200mg per day rate and hopefully off pheni forever when 2020 comes around.

Thanks for reading and stay strong, there is hope for all of us.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 6GPB for 2 years, great success at tapering 200mg a day and stabilizing to once a day dosing.

&#x200B;

Quick update 23-12/2019: Down to 1gpd now, will taper to 0 this week, thanks for all the support.

Sorry if I'm posting too much first of all, it's been a really rough week or so and I just want to get this all sorted out as soon as possible so I can get on with my life.

So I've been taking 10g/day for a few months, but in the past week or two that's shot up to 15g/day. Basically, what I'm wondering is, am I still gonna have to slow taper from 15g now, or is there a way I can quickly drop back down to 10 and go from there? I just feel like since I've been on 15 for such a short amount of time that I'm now gonna have to add months to my taper because of that small slip up. 

I've just recently started thinking about how long this is gonna take and it's absolutely insane. If I really have to slow taper from 15g, or 15,000mg, that would mean that even doing a fast taper of 50mg/day would take 300 days!!! I'm already having health complications from phenibut, in addition to all the other problems caused by substance dependence, so I really just can't stomach having to take over a year to get off this stuff just from slipping up for a few months.

Anyway, back to the point - since I've been on 15g for such a short amount of time, am I still really gonna have to slow taper from there, or is it possible to drop down from 15 back to 10 fast since I haven't been taking that dose for that long?

Any help is appreciated as always, thanks in advance!!!",1

Started phenibut a little more than 2 weeks ago and was taking 500mg daily evening time.. just for better, more restful sleep.

My last dose was 48h ago and i havent slept since then, I got constant 90 pulse, heart racing and beating like a m.f. i am also sweating, having chills, and the anxiety i've never had before - i am shaking inside, I start to worry real bad and Im thinking about going to ER..


I thought such a small dose is not a big deal, ive never abused gabaergic drugs or alcohol.. been a cannabis smoker for 9 years and quit month ago.

Can anyone give me brief info on how long it's gonna be like this.. considering my dosage and only 2 weeks of usage? I still have around 75x 500mg capsules but at this point all I want to do is dump this shitty drug, get back to normal myself and never use it again..

A couple days ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/e9pmz1/no_amount_of_phenibut_is_making_me_go_back_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to this sub because I was continuing to have withdrawals no matter the amount of phenibut I took. I was in a bit of a crisis so the post was kind of a mess, but you guys assured me that my body just needed to ""stabilize"" back to the dose I was on before.

It seems like that was the case, and I'm no longer having any withdrawal symptoms - well, at least not the crippling anxiety attacks. I've managed to stabilize myself to 3 5g doses/day, and things are going... okay.

The problem is, every time I take a dose now, it just feels... weird, and not in a good way. I don't quite know how to describe it, really. I'm feeling pretty depressed, and it's like my brain feels ""fried"", though I don't know if that's the best descriptor, since my cognitive function seems normal.

It just feels like I have some weird sort of ""negative energy"" flowing through my body. I really wish I had a better way to describe it, but I just can't think of any appropriate words. Maybe someone who's experienced the same kind of thing will know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to just get myself feeling back to normal when I take my phenibut so I can just be functional again. It's crazy to me how just having to lower my dose a bit for one day is having this much of a lasting impact. If I can just get back to when phenibut actually made me feel calm and happy, I'll be able to get on with my life and finally start tapering. 

Sorry if this post ended up sounding kind of weird and rambly, I'm pretty out of it from all of this.

Has anyone experienced this? Any advice? I'm wondering if maybe my GABA receptors are just worn out and need a break, but I'm terrified to take the risk of having to go through that hell of being in withdrawals even on a normal dose again.

Any advice would be appreciated, and thanks in advance. You guys are really helping me out here, and I'm not sure I'd be able to get through this without your help. You'll probably be seeing me more often on this sub, for better or for worse (I feel like I can be a bit annoying at times, haha)

Just one day of irregular dosing can lead to “phenibut hell”,"As the title says, remain consistent. Fluctuations of a few hundred milligrams from day to day may be OK, but at ALL COSTS, DO NOT allow yourself to have a day of extreme variance from the norm.

(Note: this is more directed towards higher dose, long term, daily users)

So don’t suddenly take several grams above or below your established norm one day. Because you may find that it completely fucks your homeostasis and you will be unable to find your “correct” dose the next day. The ensuing mental state may last a few days, weeks, or it may be the new norm until you are completely off phenibut. 

Nonetheless, it is a ticket to “phenibut hell” that has been growing in popularity lately. 

In one case, the guy just felt lazy/tired and decided to lay in bed and skip dosing for a day. In another case, the guy drastically ramped up his dose for a few days then attempted to drop back down. In a lot of cases, a shipment gets delayed and the user is forced to dramatically cut back for a day or two. But in all cases, the result is the same: a brief phase of irregular dosing leaves the individual unable to stabilize via their prior dosing regimen, and they end up in phenibut hell.

Basically, once you’re dealing with a high dose, daily phenibut addiction, your brain is in a very careful balance. Just one day of irregular dosing can throw off that balance. And once that balance is compromised, it’s very hard to re-attain. For whatever reason, you can’t just resume your previous dosage to “re-stabilize”, like you can with literally any other drug. I don’t understand why this happens, but it does, and it makes phenibut a very shitty and risky substance to be heavily addicted to.

Another way this can happen - without even changing your phenibut dose - is by messing with another gabaergic substance. Even if it’s just a 3 day binge on xanax. If it’s something your brain isn’t *already* accustomed to, it can totally throw off your “phenibut homeostasis”. I just learned this the hard way. Went on a 3 day alprazolam binge - not even high doses, maybe 4mg a day, which is nothing - and it completely messed up my phenibut regimen. I was moving along with my taper, totally fine dosing about 6.3g once daily, now my doses don’t hardly last 4 hours and I’m in WDs most of the day.

Ya’ll be safe. Stay consistent, and always stay taper-minded. You don’t even have to be drug-free if you don’t want to be... just do everything you can to be *phenibut* free.",7

I'll try to make a long story short here. I've been taking 10g/day of phenibut for a while, but in the past week or so, that's escalated to 15g/day (yes, seriously), 5g in the morning and 10g at night.

Well, due to Thanksgiving, my order of phenibut came a couple days late. All it ended up being was that I could only take 10g on one day instead of 15. I figured this would be no big deal, since I'd only been taking 15 for under a week. I had planned on going back to 10 anyway.

So I take the 10g. The next day, my order came a couple hours late. While I waited for it, I ended up going into withdrawals and having an extreme panic attack.

So I took my 10g. When it kicked in, I was still in withdrawal, though it was a bit more manageable. Naturally, I freaked out. Why was this happening?

I didn't know what to do, so I ended up taking another 2g, and I was still in bad shape, but that got me to a point where I could get by. I got a little sleep, and 12 hours later, I took another 3g to get me back to 15g. I felt normal for a bit. 

Well, 6 hours later, I'm in withdrawals again!!! So I take 10 grams, and while I'm back to a manageable level, I still feel like utter trash.

(Sorry, I guess that ended up not being very short).

Now I'm sitting here and I have no idea what to do. All this time, the dose I was taking made me feel perfectly normal, and now out of nowhere the exact same dose has me in withdrawals. I'm already at 15g/day, I absolutely cannot raise my dose, and I wanted to start slow tapering anyway.

I'm seriously freaking out here. No amount of phenibut is stopping the withdrawals, just making them a bit more manageable. I feel like such an idiot for getting myself into this situation. How could 10g/day feel great literally just a week ago, and now it has me in withdrawals?

I'm actually considering suicide right now. If 15 whole grams of phenibut per day isn't enough to get me out of withdrawals, I don't see any way out of this. I also have liver damage from all of this and there's nothing I can do about it because quitting cold turkey would probably kill me, literally. I seriously don't think there's a way out of this anymore. I feel so stupid because I've even quit phenibut once before prior to this, only to jump back in like an idiot.

Once again, I'm really sorry this post ended up being such a mess. I'm honestly having a full on crisis right now.

Since this ended up being so long:

tl;dr: I've been taking 10g/day of phenibut for about 3 months, and 15g/day for about a week. I had to go back to 10g for one day because my shipment got delayed, and now no amount of phenibut is stopping me from being in withdrawals.

Any help is very appreciated. I'm really freaking out right now.",8

So I first used phenibut way back in 2013. It was purely recreational and I was doing like 3g once a week. Never really had any problems but I really loved it. Don't even remember why I stopped really. I think I just ran out and forgot about it.

Then fast forward three years I got some again. This time I was more reckless. I started taking 1.5g every other day. Somehow I convinced myself that this wasn't addictive and I would be ok. The days off weren't too bad. I did this for like 10 months or so and then decided to quit. Well I managed to quit pretty easily I think I had like a bad day or two but nothing crazy. So then I came back to it and did the same thing again for a few months and was able to quit again.

I did this on and off and each day got more reckless. I started doing two days, sometimes three days on and one day off. But I was still able to quit without too much pain once my supply ran out and I kept convincing myself that I wasn't addicted.

Well then two months ago I decided to get some more again. I started pretty conservatively at 1g every other day. This time the days off in between started to be pretty fucking shitty. I said what the hell how about instead of taking 1.5g every other day I'll just take 600mg every day, same shit right?

Well now I've been on anywhere from 300 to 900mg of phenibut everyday for the last few weeks. Part of me wonders if I can just keep this up indefinitely without any negative side effects (since it is a relatively low dosage compared to some of y'all) but part of me hates being dependent on this shit.

Today I said fuck it I'm just gonna not take any. Started out ok but by early afternoon I started feeling really weird. Not necessarily awful just like not completely put together if you know what I mean. I had a real hard time focusing on anything so I said fuck it and took one capsule(300mg).

I feel pretty alright and slightly pleasant. So I guess that's where I'm at. 300mg is my ""baseline"". How hard do you think it'll be to get off of this? Conversely, would there be any problem if I continued at this dosage indefinitely? Its nowhere near the 10gpd I see posted on here but I still feel pretty shitty without it.

Thanks for listening to my sad story lol. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Btw I don't have a scale and buy 300mg capsules, so it'll be hard for me to taper approximate amounts.",2

I’ve been in a shitty spot financially for the last few months and I finally get my first decent paycheck on the 15th (finally started working full time at my new job vs the 10-15 hrs I was getting previously). 

My issue is that I have 80grams of phenibut on the way right now that should be here by Tuesday. This will be enough to let me do a fast taper from 4GPD and have some extra just as a precaution that I can flush when I’m done with the taper. I was under the impression that it would be here today (Monday) but what I didn’t know is that UPS doesn’t operate on Saturday making my two day delivery I paid extra for into a four day delivery haha. This wouldn’t be a huge deal normally as I could just go and buy 3 packs of the nootropic pill they sell at the big smoke near my house called limitless. Through research I’ve done on this sub and online I calculate that 12 of those pills contains roughly 3.5-4 grams of phenibut which keeps me out of withdrawal. They’re horribly overpriced at $7.50 per pack and unfortunately I only have $15 until the 15th when I get paid. 

Should I just get as many of the limitless pills as I can afford and expect some kind of minor WD? Or should I hit up a friend asking for a loaner. I’m not too sure what the results of taking 8/12 pills that I normally take. I’m only asking as I have a date tomorrow with the most amazing girl that I’ve been seeing and I really don’t want to blow it being in withdrawal making a total fool of myself. As soon as I get this shipment in I’ll be able to make it until the 15th and then I’ll be able to buy a mg scale to actually start tapering and I’ll be on my way to fixing my life. I feel like the stars are finally aligning and shits going to get better for me I just have to get over this one last hurdle in my way",1

I’ve been taking Phenibut for about a week. It’s funny because I’ve seen all the posts about people taking them for 6 days and wanting to taper lol.

I never exceeded 2.5g but most days it was just 1g divided up throughout the day. I’ve taken 300mg 3x daily for two days now with no ill side effects except waking up a little anxious in the morning.

Two questions: 

If I keep taking it like I’m taking it now, 300mg 3x a day so 900mg total daily, how hard would it be to taper if I wanted to quit as far as the seriousness of withdrawals.

It works for me like this but I don’t want to be stuck on something that’s hell to get off of.

Should I just taper and get off now? If so, how hard would it be to quit now? I know the first few days when I was coming off the 2.5g was a little rough, but as I said right now 300mg 3x a day I feel comfortable except the minor anxiety in the morning.

Thanks for your help! Any tips for the newbie would be appreciated.

I should also note I take gabapentin 400mg 4x daily and klonopin .5mg 3x daily. If anyone is wondering why I’m taking both gabapentin and phenibut, well it just makes me calmer.",1

Kratom helped a lot but recently i just did an outpatient detox for alcohol and kratom. I clearly have substance abuse issues. I'm honestly not a very anxious person, i just like getting high i guess. i was given ritalin, lorezapam, clolondine, atubuse, naltraxone, and gabapentin. I was kinda shocked at all the stuff they gave me. It was 2400 mg of gabapentin which honestly just made me high. I think i took phenibut about 2 to 3 grams twice in 10 days, but after the detox i have now taken it 1.5 to 3.5 6 days in a row. I have only 800mg gabapentin left that i just got from a friend. Anyway long story short, i cant even get to the anxiety and depression part because my headaches are so bad. i took 800mg gabapentin today which has helped immensely, and i have a kava supplement from whole foods but i'm not sure if its as good as the real deal. Any advice on these headaches? im 26 hours in and feel okay....dont' have to work for until about the 78 hour mark. I'm wondering if the  headaches are just an accumulation of all the shit i was on for the detox which ended a week ago. sorry this post is a bit rambling but i'm sitting here reading all these fucking horror stories and dreading whats to come. I even took kratom again but its effects are nil because of the naltraxone. I just want to get sober. Doing that detox while working was the hardest thing i've ever done and i just want to be out of the woods.",2

When i quit the only withdrawal i had was severe insomnia. I went to the ER and told them that i was in phenibut withdrawal and that i need Baclofen and that i want the doctor to research phenibut if he doesn't know what it is. I explained it is a GABAergic that is a Russian prescription medication. The doctor was really nice and asked if i wanted to go to detox and that he usually prescribes Baclofen for these kind of things. I explained that the only withdrawal symptom i am having is insomnia and that i don't think I'm bad enough for detox. I haven't slept in 2 days and had to get a doctor's note for calling in sick to work. He said that's fair and prescribed me 3 Valium 10mg take 1 each night for sleep. I slept great and got through the daytime lethargy with gabapentin that i had.

My history with phenibut started with a Sleepwalker shot and curiosity. I abused for 4 days with 2-3 servings of Sleepwalker a day.

 Friday night I experienced a mild brain fog and insomnia. No anxiety, but some fatigue. by Monday I was fine. I started using again at 2-3 servings of sleepwalker a day that were usually usually spaced throughout the day. 

I went on a pipeline job in Wyoming and did not bring my vehicle. 150 miles from the nearest smoke shop, my supply was depleting and fear was taking hold. On a Saturday after work, I was experiencing intense brain fog, fatigue, and anhedonia. I walked around town to every gas station in town with no luck. I found some CBD in preparation for the intense anxiety that so many have talked about. I also bought L-Theanine, 5-HTP, Ashwaganda, and a nighttime restless leg syndrome medicine with a ton of herbal supplements and chamomile. 

I spent the night obsessively reading on phenibut WD and the mental anxiety never came. At work the next week the fatigue had subsided and I had overwhelming energy. It felt like what I imagined mania to be. 

I performed at my job like I never had before and never tired out. I’m on my feet all day running back and forth 40 feet every 5 seconds taking radiographic exposures of pipe welds. There’s three exposures per weld and I shot 180 in 3 days without making a mistake. 

When my coworker would develop, I had a 30 minute break and I’d record my symptoms and current thoughts and feelings as well as drink my 10 grams of kratom every 6 hours (two year dependence). 

Music was amazing. I would reflect on my life and relive memories and try to gain insight. The physical anxiety and tremors were so intense I almost couldn’t write. The brain fog was gone and I was in hyperdrive. I ripped my skin on the ball of my foot and didn’t even notice. I “slept” for 2-4 hours every night and had no fatigue. 

About 2 weeks later I started experiencing a bout of mental anxiety and I took a trip over the weekend in the work truck to North Utah. I had road rage, and an almost constant chest anxiety. On the way back I drank some pre-workout and as I crossed the mountains on I-80 the pressure built and I entered a dissociative state where I wasn’t feeling any emotion and wasn’t thinking any thoughts unless I forced myself to. 

This lasted for 20 minutes and subsided. I never experienced any more anxiety and the only symptom was insomnia. The next month was the healthiest I have ever been mentally and physically and continued until a conflict with my NPD coworker. 

Fast forward a month I came home and took a trip back out west to sightsee and used phenibut for energy. Over the next couple months I have went from 2 Sleepwalkers a day with 2-4 day breaks every 2-4 days to 5-6 servings daily with 1 day breaks every week. 

I feel I am losing control and I plan to cold turkey again but keep my normal dose handy just in case things go sideways. Am I at risk for psychosis and/or seizures? Has anyone else ever experienced any of this?

 I work out of town and do not have access to my vehicle as I’m home every weekend now. I apologize for the drawn out backstory but I wanted to provide enough detail. Thank you in advance.",2

I usually take 2.5 - 3g once per week on Saturday, but on these two occasions I went off the rail. 

I pryamided the doses from like 2.5g on the first day to 8g on the final day. The last day I took it I slept for 2 hours during the night. 

I haven't taken it since 6am on that day. The next day was yesterday, and despite feeling like a zombie at work, I actually slept on and off in spurts of about 2 hours each, and awoke feeling like death. Headache, anxious, cold. 

Its 1 am here and I'm feeling another sleepless night coming. Work was hell today. 

I'll update with what ends up happening from here, but hopefully that gives someone a good idea of what happens when you have low tolerance and go on a short binge.

I made the idiotic realization that I had just ceased a really hard 1 week (first and only) binge on the RC benzo clonazolam a few days before I cut my dose of phenibut. Did probably 120mg over 7 days, which was appalling to me when I realized what I'd done, so I flushed the remainder. This was highly dangerous and irresponsible. Don't be like me. I consider myself VERY fortunate that I haven't seized. It's highly likely that I simply got lucky. Reducing phenibut while CTing a benzo is not safe. (EDIT: as pointed out by [u](https://www.reddit.com/user/GrandDaddyKaddy/)/GrandDaddyKaddy, CT quitting a benzo on it's own is not safe either.)

Strangely, I remember everything from that week and didn't black out at all but benzos always had a somewhat paradoxical effect on me.

Didn't realize just how severely clonazolam latches on to those receptors so I honestly think the majority of my withdrawal symptoms were from jumping CT off that stuff.

At this point, I'm at 5 GPD and feeling pretty stable. Mild brain fog and some chills when I wake up but insomnia has gone away and I've stopped having nightmares. Even my stomach issues have mostly gotten better. You'd think I'd be a puddle of anxiety but I'm more grumpy and reactive, rather than panicky.

I plan to drop about 500 mg from my phenibut dose per day until symptoms escalate. Once they reach a sufficient level of discomfort I'll wait until I stabilize again and start cutting my dose. Rinse and repeat.

If things don't get worse than they were a few days ago, I know I can handle it. I hope to be off this stuff within the next week or two, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Looking forward to total sobriety more and more each day.",6
