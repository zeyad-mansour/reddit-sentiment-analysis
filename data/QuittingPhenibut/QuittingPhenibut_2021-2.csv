Anywasy i just quit a nasty 7gpd phenibut habit. I also just quit tia sodium (300-500 mg daily). My tia dose was small and i was only on it for a little over a month so it was easy to quit with the help of kratom. For the past 3 days the only thing i have taken is kratom. Now that im not in tia withdrawal i can actually feel my kratom dose. Its helping so much with the depression from quitting phenibut. Kratom is not nearly the beast that phenibut is when it comes to addiction. If phenibut is a rotweiller kratom is chihuahua. For some people kratom is hell. But my body tolerates it well before i was taking phenibut i took kratom 25 grams daily for 3 months. When i quit kratom cold turkey it felt like i had a cold for three days than i was fine.. thats shit compared to phenibut withdrawal. Im ggonancontinue with the daily kratom use for a while. Itll keep from relapsing on phen and alcohol. I know my body. It tolerates kratom well.,3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46824047}"

I take it orally.

I‚Äôm currently 6 days off phenibut after a recent relapse where I took about 2-4 gpd for a few weeks. During the last two days I had about 3 g that day, then .5 g the next day, and then did quit CT since I was completely out. I know you‚Äôre not ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to quit CT, but I‚Äôm already 6 days in so I doubt it matters at this point.

I‚Äôve been taking fasoracetam every day since a day or two before quitting. When I take the right amount, it seems to help, but I still feel a lack of motivation and my emotions feel really dull. I also feel colder than usual from time to time in temperatures that used to make me sweat. I don‚Äôt know how much of this is caused from withdrawals and how much is from the fasoracetam. I also take trazodone at night because even the fasoracetam can help me sleep. I take between 12.5 mg-25 mg of traz to try to avoid the side effects. 

My question is, is this normal? Is it normal to feel emotionally numb when you start taking it? Do these side effects go away with time? I heard that fasoracetam‚Äòs positive effects build up over time, so maybe I just have to wait. What do you guys think? 

Please don‚Äôt give me suggestions on what supplements or nootropics you think I should take. I‚Äôm not asking for supplement recommendations. Just general advice on fasoracetam for quitting phenibut.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60094064}"

Maybe I am lucky but I have always been HIGHLY receptive to Phenibut. Even at extremely small doses I would get great positive effects. During my first year I used about 500mg once every three weeks or so with great results. However I started a rather stressful job over the summer so I decided to start taking Phenibut daily. Initially I was taking 500-750mg daily, but I found this to be way to much and ridiculously intoxicating. Essentially I would feel ""too high"" everyday, which is not what I wanted. I would have much rather preferred a subtle effect that isn't noticeable but enough to reduce anxiety. I know I am lucky because I was taking 500-700mg daily and still getting crazy effects from it. I've read that some people need way more Phenibut to even notice it lol. Anyways I reduced my daily dose to 250mg for months which was great for me; it didn't make me intoxicated but still provided really subtle and hardly noticeable effects. I quit the 250mg daily routine a week ago cold turkey with 0 withdrawals. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first night but otherwise it's been great.

I have been taking 2g of phen daily for about 2 years. I also have a prescription for gabapentin (900mg daily). I have intended to get off the phenibut so I've been saving gabapentin when I can, since I don't feel I need it when in phenibut high. (Usually taking 600mg daily gaba.)

I see taper schedules that recommend a DAILY reduction in phenibut. In my past experience, day four is the ""suck day"" for my withdrawal symptoms after each reduction in dose. (I quit 5 years ago under medical supervision.) I experienced this same timetable when I was coming down from a 3g daily dose of prescribed gabapentin as well. My doc would reduce my dose once, then again on the fifth day, after the suck day.

So my question is: is there a benefit to reducing your phenibut dose DAILY as opposed to WEEKLY? I have pre-measured capsules and I was planning on reducing 250mg once weekly. Will I get better results with a daily reduction? I know phen has a very long tail.

Also, do I compensate mg for mg for the missing phen with gabapentin or just take gaba as needed for best results? What kind of mg? I have enough to take 1200 mg or so daily for 6 weeks. I'm prescribed gabapentin for treatment-resistant bipolar anxiety.

Domestically, it gets sent in a plastic baggy. The powder is very sticky. For that reason, it will stick to the sides of the bag and on basically everything you put it on. It does not strike me as HCL/water soluble. If you pour it on water, it will just sit on top. The taste is not terrible, since you‚Äôre not using that much of it anyway. It‚Äôs difficult to measure with a mg scale. Most mg scales are not super accurate under 100mg. For instance, you may place a couple mg down and it‚Äôs not going to pick that up until a certain point. The way around it is to weigh something else and then add to that weight and subtract‚Äîor, more practically, volumetric dosing. 

Based on trying this once, the only benefits in ordering this powder is to get it faster domestically, or to buy in bulk and save money internationally. With the latter, I don‚Äôt consider this a great benefit because you don‚Äôt want to have tons of baclofen on hand. You want enough to do a taper, not to stay on the drug. That leads me to one benefit: faster shipping (avoiding customs, but customs is very unlikely to cease baclofen). 

If you have the time, but the pills. There‚Äôs at least two sources I know of that are guaranteed to deliver. I‚Äôve ordered from both of them multiple times without issue. I cannot post the names of them here, but you will be able to find at least one of them without much effort. I will update this sub if my opinions change regarding what I‚Äôve said. So far, the powder appears to at least work, and it was delivered. I‚Äôd like a few more days to verify that it works before I can be confident in that regard.

Except for this time.
The last time I got phenibut before this time, when I ran out, was the first time i actually experienced phenibut withdrawals, and I was pretty surprised at how bad they were, also confused because ide never experienced them before when taking the same amount over the same period of time. Anyway I pretty much told myself not to buy phenibut again because it sucked quite a bit.

Fast forward a few months and stupid me buys phenibut again, the same amount: 60 pills at 250mg each.

I have been taking 750mg (3 pills) every single day, and I have 6 pills left. My last dose was yesterday morning and I told myself I'm gunna stop now and save the 6 pills in case the withdrawals are really bad I can at least get some relief. Well, it's only been 30 hours and I literally feel out of touch with reality already, huge amounts of anxiety, and honestly scared. Almost terrified. So I just took 3 pills in desperation because I CANT DO THIS ITS REALLY BAD. I cant wait for these pills to kick in because it's really bad right now.

I need help guys, please, someone give me some advice on what to do, I'm fucking terrified right now. I'm probably gunna end up having to go to the hospital to be honest. I am on methadone and have felt full blown opioid withdrawals before, and let me tell you, phenibut withdrawals cut it close. It's a completely different type of withdrawal though so it's hard to compare, but the psychological symptoms are too much for me to bare and I'm fucking terrified.
What can I do? Any help is GREATLY appreciated!!!!!

EDIT: I ended up going to see my family doctor, who knows I have bad anxiety issues, and she gave me a script for xanax .25mg. I'm hoping it will help me I'm pretty sure it will. Thank you very very much for everyone trying to help me I really appreciate it  EDIT: The day after being prescribed the xanax: I must say the xanax has taken 90% of the withdrawal away, no panic, no delusional type thinking, no dissociative thoughts. The only negative is that I'm really f*kin tired all the time lol. After 2 more days I'm gunna stop taking the xanax  because the phen withdrawals should be all but gone.

Try the Wim Hof breathing method.,"Last night I awoke at 3:30am, feeling a surge of restless legs coming on. I thought to myself ""oh great, another 4 hours to get up for work and I'm not going to fall back asleep."" After tossing and turning for some time, I began thinking about RLS and the cause of it. I remembered reading about it being a dopamine disorder similar to Parkinson's, and I thought about things that can raise your dopamine.... LDopa, Sam-E... Etc. Then I remembered reading that the Wim Hof breathing method can raise your dopamine and norepinephrine levels by 1000x. So I mustered all my strength and did 2 cycles of Wim Hof there in my bed.

I couldn't believe what happened next. My restless legs completely dissipated, and I was able to fall asleep until nearly my alarm went off. Sure, I woke up feeling like crap still, but after a cold shower (another Wim Hof technique), and getting dressed, I felt more or less okay.

What is the Wim Hof Breathing Method?

While sitting in a comfortable place, take 30 quick, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Then, take a deep breath and exhale; hold until you need to breathe in. Inhale again, as deep as you can, and hold it for 10 seconds. Repeat as many times as you like.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49947038}"

That was just the beginning of my journey to hell.,"A month ago Phenibut turned on me after binging on it for a week. I don‚Äôt know how much I was taking and one day it stopped working no matter how much I took. I can‚Äôt adequately describe the feeling other than to say it was mental and physical torture and caused a deep tremble in my soul. 

I probably blacked out and fell to the floor over 20 times that day. The sound of my phone hitting the floor from falling from my hands as I fell to the floor haunts me. By the afternoon I knew that I needed to go to the ER. I could not fix this. For the first time in my life I genuinely feared that I would die. 

I was writhing in pain and hyperventilating so bad the nurse immediately came and got me from the waiting room and wheeled me back to a room. I told the Dr about the Phenibut and begged him to help me. Soon after I got 2 shots of Ativan and the next thing I remember is waking up being wheeled out to the car by the nurse and my son walking by my side. The Dr had given him a script for Ativan as well as some to give me that night since it was late and the pharmacies near us were closed. 

Out of ignorance, my husband threw out my Phenibut. I knew that it was dangerous to come off cold turkey and that I needed to at least get on baclofen. Taking Ativan throughout the day made me kinda out of my mind but i somehow decided that I needed to go to a mental hospital and be admitted through the ER. After spending over 24 hours in the ER I was finally transferred to Crossbridge. 

The next 7 days were were spent in mental hell. I had very scary delusions that I thought were real until my 8th day in the hospital when they stopped. I came home on the 10th day but still had bad anxiety and deep bone pain. I went to my NP, took the case study about baclofen (I was given baclofen in the hospital for a total of 2 days and it was WONDERFUL. I talked the psychiatrist into putting me on it and it completely took my withdrawals away but the Dr decided to take me off because I ‚Äúprobably wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it outside of the hospital; he was right.) and she yelled at me accusing me of just wanting to get high ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs similar to Phenibut‚Äù. I truthfully told her that it did not get me high at all but she doubled down. What an idiot!! I wanted to say ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt give me this I WILL get high‚Äù. Which is exactly what happened. 

I don‚Äôt want to say what helped because I wish I had never heard about it but after everything Phenibut put me and my family through I am now back on it. I‚Äôm stabilizing at 1g a day.

Well fast forward to now and I got myself into another bad spot with F-phenibut. That was about a 7 month and 2gpd+ addiction. I know I that‚Äôs insane but it just works it‚Äôs way up. Well I got baclofen again and just hopped straight to it and the first 7 days were rough but I took the time off work because I knew I would have to.

I‚Äôve CT off of F-pheni before without any helper meds and by day 10 I was golden.

(5 years, 3 daily) It feels like I lost 4 years of life, and just got it back.","I'm *finally* phenibut and kratom free, over my unusually short withdrawal period, and it feels like my soul has returned. my life is back, my motivation is back, me desire to DO SOMETHING is back, I feel nostalgic, like I did when I was a young kid in college full of optimism for what my life had in store. Strangely enough my body feels better, my vision feels better, and my head feels better as well. I feel ""sharp,"" and my personality, my interests, my sense of humor, and my mood are all way more consistent. I feel like a grown ass man, someone able to take life by the horns.

My self confidence and self esteem is amazing right now. Not in a manic sense, not like I'm on a drug, I just feel like an ""equal"" to others, like I have worth. Like I can enter into a room and belong, take a job a belong, speek up in a meeting, etc.

I started taking phenibut about 7 years ago, in fact I feel like I was partly responsible for the phenibut craze because I basically evangelized it on a certain forum (before reddit). Phenibut was initially a life-saver, literally, it gave me the confidence to come out of my shell, make freinds, date, have sex, go out to bars, clubs, events, and social functions. using phenibut *strategically* allowed me to ""reprogram"" myself into a better more confident person. It took me really far in life. Eventually I started using it every Fri and Sat, and after a few weeks the withdrawals would last from Sunday until I re-dosed on friday. During that period I assumed my increased anxiety, depression, sweating, etc, was my ""baseline"", but no, it was phenibut withdrawals.

The worst thing happened when I had a HUGE negative live event(s) that pushed me to start dosing phenibut every single day for almost 3 years, which put me at this year. I took phenibut and kratom daily because I could not handle the massive anxiety and depression that i was going through, couldn't perform my job on w/d's, and couldn't maintain my relationship with my gf if w/d'ing. So phenibut and kratom became daily. 20g of Phenibut per day and 60+ gpd of Kratom.

> What Phenibut and Kratom did to me:

My baseline dose of phenibut and kratom was simply to keep me from withdrawing, I wasn't even getting a real high, but I damn sure was experiencing *really* negative physical, mental, and emotional consequences from using them. They creeped up on me slowly, became so pervasive that I thought it was normal. It was just ""who I am""

- My motivation ceased to exist entirely. I stayed in the same dead end, low paying, shitty job for over 5 years. I had absoluely no desire to advance my career, even though I'm very intelligent, skilled, and was constantly being pushed to go for promotions. Nope. I just didn't care.

- I had *constant* anxiety. For the most part I felt ""ok"", but that was simply because I wasn't doing a goddamn thing. I just did the same reclusive thing every single day, EVERY SINGLE DAY, FOR YEARS. Not an exageration.

- BAD anxiety. When I wasn't feeling my baseline anxiety, a sense of dread that I had come to accept as ""norma"", if I did have an anxious thought or experiance my anxiety 100x'd and it was unbearable. Like going into a full blown panic attack. I'd be stuck for the rest of the day(s) feeling like I was on the verge of a panic attack. 

- The above descriptions of anxiety led me to a level of extreme procrastination, and I mean *extreme*. Like putting off filing my taxes for 2 YEARS, not renewing my drivers license for a YEAR. Waiting until the very last day of my apartment lease to move out and then sign a new lease somewhere else. I was late on every single bill. I was just too anxious to do any of that. 

- As a result my financial situation became abysmal. I was stuck in a shit low paying job, late on every bill, unpaid bills piling up, late fee's accumulating, and having now way to catch up. I just doubled down on procrastinating which made things worse. My daily routine became to browse reddit all day every day for YEARS.

- I had zero desire to socialize. I lost all of my friends. I barely saw my family. I could tell my family was worried about me, and they couldn't understand why. I only got a girlfriend as a fluke because I dosed extra phenibut for a time which shot up my libido and pushed me to find a girl, well eventually my tolerance went up and I was stuck with a gf I didn't like and an even worse addiction.

- My daily habits became set in stone hardcore. And by habits I mean ""sit at my computer all day"" and that's about it. I just didn't care about doing anything else. 

- I lost ALL of my dreams. I was once extremely ambitious, almost too ambitious, I could feel euphoria simply by daydreaming about what i could accomplish. Phenibut and kratom killed all of that.

> Now, after being off. 

It feels like my life is back. I want to do things, anything. I want to get an awesome job, go to cool social events, travel the world, try new things, make friends, try new hobbies. I can't describe it honestly. It feels fucking nostalgic. 

This was a loong taper, and thankfully since my tolerance was so high for both phenibut and kratom the withdrawals were not actually all that bad, no where near as bad as they were back when I first started taking them years ago and experienced withdrawals, which were fucking awful.

For those that have not read that post, I was at about 1.8 grams a day. Some days I was a little higher. Most days I took 900mg in the morning and 900mg at night. On tougher days I would take 1.2 grams in the morning and 1.2 at night, totaling 2.4 grams a day, I tried to not do this. 

I took my last lyrica dose of 1.2 grams on 2/16, I took a higher dose because I was going to the doctor to refill my gabapentin script, which was 800mg x 3 a day. After I showed the doctor my right leg, was hit while riding my motorcycle, he took sympathy on me. I asked about Lyrica, and he asked how much I wanted. I showed him a website that had the conversion on it. The conversion for 2400mg of gabapentin is 400mg of Lyrica. So we decided to do 300mg a day to start with. 

I picked up my script that morning and took my first lyrica dose, then took it again that night. I did not take phenibut that night. The last time I took phenibut was 2/16 at 6am. I have taken my Lyrica as prescribed and I have had 0 issues. 

I understand that lyrica is addictive and has a bad withdrawal, but it enables me to get through a work day with no nerve pain in my right leg, something phenibut did not help with. But what I am happy about is that I no longer have to buy phenibut. 

For those at phenibut doses higher than me, I don‚Äôt know if the lyrica dose I‚Äôm on will help. For those that are at my dose, I don‚Äôt know if a lower lyrica dose will help. All I can say is that lyrica has enabled me to get off phenibut and I will never look a phenibut capsule again.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52599174}"

Every week I took 1-2 days off and the 7th week I only consumed 4gpd. I did the huge jump from 7g to 4g directly and 4gpd is a bitch. Anhedonia, no sleep gang, restless legs, depression, social anxiety back here and big future anxiety and self worth and esteem issues.

I now take 3x1g of Agmatine since yesterday and today the 4gpd were kind of enough and I feel okay. I can work on my essay for uni. Maybe this is only a lucky day. Next week I have to go work again 5 days a week and in the end of March I have to write an exam. 

I need to function. My life sucks right now and also did everytime I wasn‚Äôt on Phenibut. I suffered from depression and social anxiety since I was 15. Tried 3 therapies and about 8 meds. Nothing helped. Phenibut was the only possibility to get some life experiences one should have at the age of 21.

Right now I‚Äòm on an antidepressant called Amitriptyline 100mg at night. Also no help. On Friday I have an appointment with my doc. We already talked about gabapentin or pregabalin as next group of meds to try as nothing ever helped me but fuck I guess that these will give me hellish withdrawals too. I still hope my doc will prescribe me one of those to function at least a bit right now in this time of a lot of university stuff, side job and trying to live like making two or three friends and finding a supportive girlfriend...

Fuck fuck fuck. Suffering so long makes me tired. Every period I abused phenibut I was fine with the world, at least a bit. I was functioning. I now need to get off Phenibut first. What else could help me to get off it more fast. Maybe I get the gabapentin or pregabalin. I dont know. I also bought magnolia bark now as I heard it affects GABA somehow. What else could help with withdrawing and getting off faster?

I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety and my brain just was like ""okay you have to get through this internship to complete your bachelor, take phenibut how much you need and then worry about withdrawing later. most important now: get through the internship."". Well here we go, I abused phenibut daily (except for 1-2 days a week) at 7g for 6 weeks. Lower doses don't work for me. The last days (7th week) I reduced from 7g to 4g directly and I feel horrible: anhedonia, perspectivelessness, horrible sleep, depression, I'm not functioning and I see my whole life as non functioning.

I already tried about 8 medications (all the usual ones and MAOIs) for my depression and social anxiety, 3 therapies. Nothing worked. Right now I'm in behavioral therapy and on Amitriptyline 100mg (a tricyclic antidepressant). On Friday I have an appointment with my doc. We already talked about Gabapentin and Pregabalin. She was more on the side of gabapentin. My doc will probably prescribe me one of those as no other med worked for me and gabapentin or pregabalin is one of the last possibilities. What do you think, will Gabapentin or Pregabalin help me with depression and social anxiety as well as phenibut withdrawal at the same time? Should I tell her about me abusing Phenibut daily since the last time we met or better not tell her about it as she might think oh oh he's abusing GABAergics, I won't give him another GABAergic.

I'm 21 and suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15. I finally want to live life and enjoy moments in such a young age. This is all time I won't never be able to get back. Fuck me. Like for how long will this miserable life still continue, my mental health issues are so restricting and taking all my life time. I want to have hobbies, a girlfriend, a job, a life. And now the withdrawal of Phenibut will take some time away too. Fuck fuck.

What do you mean? How should I go on? 

\- Should I stay on the 4g daily even if I feel horrible and have to work from next week Monday everyday as well as write an essay and learn for an exam in university. Or will it be okay if I still take the 7g for the days until Friday when I have my appointment and at least be able to get as far as possible with my essay and be able to work one week feeling okay? Then hopefully on Friday I get the pregabalin being able to get me off Phenibut withdrawal and help with social anxiety (the main source of my depression).

\- Will Pregabalin or Gabapentin help me? Which one better? Also at doses of 7g Phenibut? Will I be just okay then or maybe even feel good? I mean the med has to fight my withdrawal then too additionally to my depression and social anxiety.

Hey everybody,

So in the past, I've been a drug addict, always trying to medicate for anxiety with poor results. After giving up all drugs aside from phenibut, microdosing psychedelics, and regrettably smoking weed a few times (it's just boring and not for me anymore), I've had more forward progress with my life in years. Life has been really good and I've been happy with what I'm doing, who and what I'm connected to/with, and my future. However, I had a huge realization that the phenibut might be a big issue to deal with in the future that could potentially break me based on the stories I've read about it's withdrawal on Reddit.

I have been taking 250mg 3x per day for about 3 months now. Daily use, which is starting to seem bad. Do you think now that I've got into a good life routine that I could start tapering my phenibut down and try to quit it? How painful will this be in terms of withdrawal? I've never gone over my 250mg 3x a day (morning, 2-3pm dose, before bed) in these 3 months. Would it make sense to just keep taking it as I am as long as my life is getting better?

Maybe some one has some experience here using mulungu to come off Phenibut and/or kratom. I cold turkeyed kratom yesterday. Maybe someone has some ideas or knowledge about scientific reasons that mulungu could help.

Otherwise there also is a substance called Kanna (sceletium tortuosum) which is an SSRI. What about this? Is this something that might help? For that I would have to get off my amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressants I take (100mg at night) which also acts on Serotonin. But I think being on amitriptyline even if I don‚Äòt feel any effects from it might also ease my coming off symptoms.

And regarding my depression and social anxiety I already tried about 8 prescribed pharmaceuticals (the usual ones, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclics) and 2 depth psychological therapies and am now in a behavioral therapy. So I tried the usual ways but none give me an effect at all. Phenibut was the only thing that enabled me to live a life. The reason why I started.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5753301}"

I've known about the issue of physical dependence for quite some time but even after several weeks of using it every day, I would in most cases just stop using it or I would do a quicker taper.

I first tried phenibut back in 2019, using it a few days a week and sporadically for months. Fast forward to 2020, I started using it to ease the rebound anxiety from GHB. Then I started going on 2-3 week-long binges of phenibut - never exceeding 2gs. I would do a quick taper from 2gs to 250mg over the course of a week and was fine.

In October of 2021, I used phenibut right after a long day and night of using GHB while using ecstasy. For whatever reason, I continued to take it, primarily at night for sleep. Even taking it in large doses during the day didn't do anything for me. October turned into November, November into December, January into February. I've been consuming mostly just 750mgs each night and the last 2 months I would use 2gs about 2-3 nights a week. I've tried repeatedly to taper but then a stressful day at work would creep up and I continued using it.

Finally this past week, I had one bottle left and did a quick half-ass taper or so I thought I did. I had 4-5 days of only using 500mgs and starting this past Saturday 2-12-2021, I took only 250mgs. I woke up Sunday, everything was fine. I had 3 pills left (750mgs) and I forgot to actually take it. Monday comes around, everything is fine, and decided to not take any of the pills I had left since I made it 2 days without it. I wake up Tuesday and everything is fine until 1:30 p.m.

I was at my favorite local cafe and I'm eating my food when my vision becomes very all over the place - somewhat blurry but just unable to focus on anything. I started to become jittery which I ignored because I had just consumed a large venti ice coffee which typically makes me jittery. As I'm getting up to leave, my vision is horrible. It was like trying to drive intoxicated and you use only 1 eye to keep focused. I was unable to make it home, so I drove to my mother's 7 minutes away. Once I get inside my hands are shaking even worse and I could barely open the door. I go into my old room and the shakes really started. At first I thought my new blood pressure medication was causing this BUT then I remembered the phenibut. I freaked out. I went into the living room with my mother and started pacing, freaking out. I couldn't tell her what to do. I remember that the 3 pills I had left were in the car so I run to my car and take them. Googling how long it takes for phenibut to kick in (2hrs.) and I freak out even more, especially since I just had a large lunch. Fast forward to 1:45 p.m./1:55 p.m. and I call the local health store and thankfully they have a bottle. Having gone through Kratom withdrawals and my mother helping me with that 4 years ago, I was scared to tell her. I finally started explaining what was going on and I begged her not to get upset. Thankfully she saw the desperate look on my face and saw that I was trembling so much that I could barely drink water, she asked what do we need to do. We leave for the store and it's probably 2:30 p.m. and by the grace of God, the trembling slowly starts to subside. I'm not sure why it started to settle down so quickly other than the fact that I drank a ton of water to dissolve the pills. Once home (now 2:45 p.m.) I have realized I have a therapy appointment via zoom at 3. Thankfully for the most part the shaking has stopped enough that I can function and my eyesight is getting better. Fast forward to 4:00p.m. and I'm back at baseline.

So, mom is extremely supportive and I came up with a taper schedule along with giving her my debit/credit cards and any other means to buy phenibut. She's kept the bottle with her. As I speak I've taken any since around 1:45 p.m. yesterday. Like I said I've been consuming mainly 750mgs with the occasional 2/3 days up to 2gs for major sleep during certain nights. I would love feedback on my taper schedule below. I'm prepared to go to the doctor for baclofen but I'd rather wait and try this taper first rather then throwing another drug into the mix.

PLEASE no negative comments or harsh feedback. I want to quit and I'm doing everything I need to at this point to put this down for good.

Dosage: 750mgs with 2-3 days around 2gs. I've been using everyday for about 4 months.

I've decided on this tapering schedule based on how much I was using and since it's only been about 4 months.

Taper schedule:

Week 1:

2/16 - 750mg
2/17 - 750mg

3/4 - 250mg
3/5 - 250mg
3/6 - 250mg
3/7 - 250mg
3/8 - 250mg

IF withdrawals occur, then I will open each capsule and measure out 125mg. I'll continue for one additional week.

let me know about your story with Phenibut. How much for how long? Why and what effects? Where are your now on your path off getting off it?

To my story:

First let me say I abused Phenibut 2 times already and am here suffering with my 3rd time coming off but as I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (today 21) let me make you clear that I never ever regret taking Phenibut. It was 100% worth every minute of withdrawal, finally being able to live for at least some weeks or month in my life. It was the only substance that ever helped and my doc and I tried almost everything. 

Well phenibut isn't as strong anymore as it was the first period of abuse, it was making me hypomanic feeling like the protagonist in a movie, like a superhero or the best way I can describe it like the protagonist in the movie ""Limitless"" and the pill he takes would be ""Phenibut"". Yes I really felt like that and had the feeling of being able to do everything I wanted to and oof I was a Social God as well as a Sex God. Life was unbelievably amazing.

This time (my 3rd) I abused Phenibut approx. 7g for 6 weeks almost daily (mostly 5 of 7 days a week) because I had to do an intern for my bachelor degree. I always abused because of social anxiety and important episodes in my life like this I wouldn't have get through without Phenibut. And fuck, yes, withdrawing hurts again and makes me so empty and perspectiveless. I'm losing myself. On Phenibut I was someone and my mental health was stable.

I'm now at 4g daily and want to quit but at the same time I have to finish an essay until end of march and soon study for an exam (which also is end of March). Also next week I should work again. From April I will have to do another internship for 6 months. So how should I go on? What would be the smartest move to get all this shit done? I could also play ""sick"" at my moms place and quitting the side job I have. Just coming off Phenibut sick in bed so I am able to write my essay, learn for an exam and start a new intern then when finally off Phenibut. 

I soon have an appointment with my doc for my medication (for depression & social anxiety) and as I tried so many without effect we now reached the big Gabapentin as a possibility. Will this prescription might be a big help for me to get off Phenibut? Any other suggestions or possibilities how I should go on? I have to do so much, I'm 21 and just at the end of my bachelor.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39590862}"

I never intended to use phenibut again. Unlike some on this sub, I am not particularly wild about the effects. I‚Äôve only had positive experiences from phenibut a handful of times. Most of the time I‚Äôve used it, I do not notice any benefit. Unfortunately, I got in a pickle with something I enjoy: pregabalin. The first time it was gabapentin. Both of those I enjoy, especially pregabalin. I was able to use phenibut to avoid gabapentin withdrawal and tapered off phenibut fairly easily. This time around, I‚Äôve tapered phenibut rapidly from nearly 8gpd. In only weeks, I am down to under 2 and intend on only staying on for a few more weeks at most. So far, so good.

Give it a few weeks, maybe a month, and you will be better than ever. Drop the booze, that will help more than anything.

No matter how bad you feel right now, i promise it will get better. That's at least what i needed to hear when i felt the primal fear, and trust me it went away YOU WILL SURVIVE.

For reference, last night was the first time I've taken phenibut since 2017.

Everything went well for the first hour or so. Eventually I had to go to sleep because I was feeling too floaty. Right now I'm pretty nauseous. I feel like shit.

How badly did I fuck up? Can I just wait this out? What should I do? I want this garbage out of me.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get any as all the health food stores in my town were sold out, and I ordered it online & already was through the worst part of WD by time it arrived by mail. I almost threw it away after I read all the nightmare stories about it. But, the suspense was killing me so I decided to try it. 

The first time I took it I took 2 pills(600mg) and I recall the euphoric rush feeling that some people described as being like ecstasy about 45 min after taking it.  I have done my share of ecstasy in my younger years, and this had a very slight feeling like that, but it only lasted for like an hour or so and then it wore off, & I just got tired. Luckily I took it later in the day as I just went to sleep. I have taken 1-2 pills a few other times since then and all it does is makes me tired & very minimal euphoric feeling. Maybe I am lucky in the fact that I don't prefer it, and I suppose if there was nothing around and I didn't feel good, I might be inclined to take more. Maybe it hits everyone different, or maybe if I did 3-4 pills at a time I would feel it or mixed it with other things, I would think different. Don't prefer the feeling though. I have tried Kratom many times and to me that was much better as far as energy and more of a natural high well feeling. 

Reading about the horrible withdrawals of Phenibut I have seen here, its sad to hear that and sounds similar to alcohol withdrawals, which I have been through in the past(seizures, hospital, DT's). Not to mention a very bad painkiller addiction that ended up me going to rehab and then outpatient methadone clinics, which i am done with now luckily.

There's another post on here if you want more detail.

But after doing some research, I've discovered something rarely talked about on this sub that has been life-changing for me.

**Potassium Deficiency.**

Phenibut not only dehydrates you, but causes you to piss out more essential electrolytes, including Potassium. If you are not replacing that with your diet (which is very hard to do), you are draining yourself of a vital electro-nutrient that regulates everything from your breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow and muscle function. The condition is called hypokalemia and can be fatal if unchecked.

*There are reports of phenibut/alcohol induced hypokalemia that were fatal.*

Symptoms of potassium deficiency:

**1. Weakness and Fatigue**

**2. Muscle Cramps and Spasms**

**3. Digestive Problems**

**4. Heart Palpitations**

**5. Muscle Aches and Stiffness**

**6. Tingling and Numbness**

**7. Breathing Difficulties**

**8.Dizzyness/Vision Problems**

**9 Bloating**

**10. Mood Changes/Psychosis**

**11. Blood pressure problems (high and low swings)**

**12. Peripheral neuropathy**

I was experiencing every single one of these symptoms constantly. After discovering the link between potassium, phenibut and physiological functions - I rushed to the gas station and slammed 2 Body Armor drinks (over 2000MG of potassium).

Within an hour, all of these symptoms went away. I now be sure to maintain a healthy potassium level daily, and I feel better than I have in years.

This explains why every time I went to the ER thinking I was dying, I would immediately feel better once they gave me IV hyrdation. I always drink alot of water - but that actually strips you even more of vital nutrients. It's also important to note that potassium levels regulate magnesium and sodium levels (essential for living). When one tanks, they all tank to maintain a ratio to each other.

I know it seems silly, but don't underestimate your bodies desire to maintain an electro-chemical homeostasis.**Some of what you are all feeling is not simply withdrawal.**

You have fucked your body's electro-signaling system up. The good news is, it's an easy fix with immediate relief.

However was suggested mirtazapine..

I'm %100 sure it's due to the antihistamine action, but this stuff halts any restless insomnia.. Even got rid of nightmares for me (if you guys get those). I get vivid dreams dont' get me wrong, but this stuff has been a god send... As if I ever mess up on my night time pheni taper dose (since I split my pheni dose of 1.3 into two doses for tapering), I can just take a mirtazapine and any anxiety from missing some of my dose/not having enough just goes away completely! 


I'm starting to think I might use this to actually make larger cuts for my night dose.

Supplements I use for taper/helpers: My prescribed klonopin in higher doses sometimes when making large cuts within the same week, NAC, mirtazapine, hydration/electrolytes and sometimes diphenhydramine. 

I plan to use agmatine sometime, but it makes me restless with my OCD for some reason. Will try memantine as I've heard hype over that and found out it might be fine with my SSRI. 


Any other suggestions you guys have that are SSRI compatible? What do you use that helps?


As for now I'm waiting until I can find a good doctor that I can trust for baclofen which might take a bit (mother is helping), so I'm looking for supplements that help people amazingly during their taper.

I couldn‚Äôt believe that it actually made me want to quit drinking. It was unbelievable. It changed my life in so many ways. I quit alcohol, weed, and buspar with phenibut. I started writing my own music again, and I was also performing at a higher level at gigs with the bands I‚Äôm in. I had read about it being addictive but I didn‚Äôt care because I was so happy to be off alcohol. I had quit alcohol and gone through I withdrawl several times in my life so I arrogantly told people, ‚ÄúIf I can handle alcohol withdrawal I can handle phenibut withdrawal.‚Äù How wrong I was. 

Somewhere down the line I was diagnosed with bipolar type ii and I realized the phenibut was making me hypomanic. Like permanently hypomanic, but I loved it. I would sleep 4-5 hours a night, if at all, I didn‚Äôt eat much. All I needed was phenibut. Then the phenibut actually induced full blown mania which isn‚Äôt typical of bipolar ii. For two weeks I thought I was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ meant to start a following and teach people about the meaning of life through the healing powers of music. But as Jesus in a new carnation I thought I should be less preachy than Jesus had been in the days of the Bible, that way people wouldn‚Äôt want to put me on a cross this time. Fucking insane. The only person I told about it was my ex girlfriend, who spent days trying to convince me I wasn‚Äôt Jesus. Eventually I came to and realized I had been experiencing mania and that was pretty weird to accept. It was an embarrassing feeling to realize that I thought I was Jesus lmao. However, I still look back on that two week period fondly lol, if there‚Äôs a bipolar person reading this then you probably get it haha. 

Even after my Jesus delusions I still kept taking phenibut anyway. I was one of those rare extreme types with it. I didn‚Äôt even measure my doses. I would just take like 10 orange lift mode scoops at a time several times a day. Sometimes 3-4 dosings a day. How much I was taking is an approximation but it was about 20 grams and more at times. There were multiple occasions that I blacked out, it felt like my experiences with LSD psychosis. A few times I was found walking in and out of my room repeatedly and performing strange repetitive movements and repeating phrases, kept trying to run outside. My vision was as blurry as it can get on a heavy dose of mdma. I would throw up the strangest puke. In the middle of the night I would wake up choking on this strange chemical burn in my throat...it was weird. This burning sensation and chemical taste that seemed to have turned my saliva into a bio weapon. I would choke on it and gasp for air. I don‚Äôt know what was happening. It was like the phenibut was liquefying my insides or something. I‚Äôll never know because the doctors didn‚Äôt give a shit enough to ask or help me with tapering

I decided I had to quit no matter what when I began getting pains in my sides, I‚Äôm guessing my kidneys and liver. I tried to stop several times but I couldn‚Äôt bare not feeling totally fucking amazing at all times. But I eventually went for it. My bitch of a doctor refused to give me any medication to help with the withdrawal though. She insultingly told me she wouldn‚Äôt prescribe anything to me because I‚Äôm bipolar, even though those medications that work for phenibut withdrawl don‚Äôt cause mania in people. So I went home and I printed out case studies about phenibut withdrawl and medications that can help. She didn‚Äôt even take the stack of papers to read. I left in tears. I was told to find a psychiatrist, which is almost impossible sometimes. I only found one psychiatrist in my town that takes my insurance and there were no openings for months. I realized I was on my own. 

I bought agmatine with money that a nice gentleman from this sub sent me. I was able to immediately cut out all the idiotic extra doses throughout the day, so I began taking about 5 grams in the morning, and another 5 in the evening or late afternoon. So that was an immediate 10 gram or so reduction. If you take as much as I was taking you can slash that shit in half. I wasn‚Äôt very methodical with it honestly but I was very slow and patient, I didn‚Äôt rush it. I would usually reduce my doses by half a gram or a gram and then I would keep taking that same dose for a week or two weeks, whatever I felt like I needed. Then one day I was brave enough to cut out my afternoon dose and only take phenibut in the morning. That‚Äôs when I started having real intense chest pain and my heart would race really bad. My heart rate felt dangerously high at times. I was pretty scared and I was pissed the fuck off I couldn‚Äôt get help from doctors. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt know when it was, but when I finally got down to like 3 grams a day I no longer felt any effects from the phenibut and the physical withdrawl symptoms seemed to almost go away. But the anhedonia took over. I inherently struggle with anhedonia having bipolar ii as well as aspergers so the phenibut really added to my feeling of being dead inside. I had some good experiences with Rhodiola rosea 3% sal which helped me some days to get the energy to go to work and whatnot. 

It‚Äôs been like two months I think since I‚Äôve taken phenibut, I haven‚Äôt been counting the days. But I‚Äôve got little to be proud of. I feel emptier than I did before phenibut and I‚Äôm drinking again, taking drugs to avoid the depression and anhedonia. I should mention though that before I really started slipping back into drinking I got a gym membership and the exercise helped immensely, it was surprising to me. I recommend trying to work out if you‚Äôre tapering from phenibut or if you have recently quit and are drowning in the anhedonia and depression. My story isn‚Äôt as pretty and nice as some, maybe less inspiring. But my point is, I was taking fucking insane doses, I tapered myself, and I didn‚Äôt have a seizure or a hospitalization of any kind. I wish all of you good luck and good vibes, do not give up. You WILL beat this addiction if you don‚Äôt give up and go back to the phenibut.",37,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4257542}"

But I soon ended up taking it every 2nd or 3rd day, then after about 6 weeks taking it every day. Averaging about 2g a day. I was like that for 2 months. I spent a lot of time on the forums reading that Kratom WD's are not even comparable to Kratom WD's (1year use peaking at 40gpd) I went cold turkey off Kratom back in October, and it was an absolute hell weak. So was very worried about WD's from coming off Phenibut. Anyway I got down to about 1.5g before running out last week, and Think I may have been one of the lucky ones. I first felt the WD's on day 3, but it just felt like a bad day. Feeling low, depressed and a bit scatter brained. Day 4 actually felt great then days 5,6,7 again felt low, depressed and a bit dissociative, but the insomnia  also kicked in. Today is day 8 and had a good nights sleep, and feel good again. I expect I might have a couple more rough days. Rough but very manageable. To be honest, If I didnt know about the dangers of Phenibut and the symptoms of WD I would I just thought I maybe had a bug, and was not able to sleep from work stress. So I know this may be a bit premature and I was not using for all that long, but still feel I dodged a bullet.   
I took ashwaganda, magnesium, zinc, the last couple of weeks leading up to this, so not sure if that helped but glad to have this stuff behind me. Both Kratom & Pheni CT's were due to late/non deliveries from ordering online. Good Luck to all going through this. I had a taste and its not worth it by a long shot in the end.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4413729}"

Fast forward, the benzo wd symptoms have long since passed and I have just swapped out 1300mg of my daily 2300mg dose of phenibut (all taken at once in the morning) with 60mg of baclofen after realizing how sensitive I was to phen wd having tried a taper of 20mg a week and not finding it worth continuing after the effects observed at week three.    


Anyways, two days into the 1000mg phen and 60mg baclofen experiment I have noted a variety effects that are to be expected but I am also starting to have the exact types of cravings for sugar that I had during my benzo taper. Whether or not it's truly hypoglycemia doesn't matter to me, I'm just curious as to whether or not anyone else has experienced this. The wd symptoms are quite unique by comparison to benzo wd IMO but I would be quite surprised if I'm just suddenly having these same distinct sugar cravings while starting my transitional taper.  


TL;DR phenibut taper seems to be causing sugar cravings similar to benzo withdrawal. Has anyone else experienced this?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4903264}"

I really debated on it because of how nowhere really knows about phenibut but i found a detox a state over that knows how to treat it.

I wish it was just phenibut, im dependent on around 4 grams. I also have a 2mg flualprazolam habit after switching from regular alprazolam 1mg footballs which was just fucking stupid. And finally sniff 2 fentanyl 30s throughout my day after my grandma plug died and i lost access to real Mbox 30s that were actually oxycodone. 

Im scared shitless to say the least, but i know that this is the only way I'll get better. I would just do the detox and come home, but i really know that i need professional help and need to learn how to live soberly.

I did a detox for a 6-8mg xanax habit around 2 and a half years ago, and within 6 months of being out, i found phenibut and instantly went balls to the wall and got dependent despite all the warnings i read.

I have a super addictive personality and am hoping staying for the rehab can help me to fight cravings and overall just get me to a point where I don't feel like i need drugs to live a happy life.

I tend to need higher doses of things to feel them. This, combined with the delayed onset, led me to take more than I needed a few times (2 to 3g), I think my ""ideal"" dose was somewhere around 900-1200mg. I did notice a kind of withdrawal 2-3 days after those days when I took too much (intense anxiety, feelings of dread, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, incredible teeth pain - maybe from the HCL although these are in capsules).

I quickly discovered how taking more phenibut would completely eliminate those symptoms. My dosing frequency increased.

Then, starting two weeks ago, here is how I dosed:

day 1: 1200 mg

day 2: no phenibut

day 3: no phenibut

day 4: no phenibut

day 5: 2400 mg

day 14: 7200mg (that was yesterday)

I can't keep taking this stuff. I am pretty concerned about what might be in store for me by quitting CT.

I already have an Rx for gabapentin, and I was able to get an Rx for baclofen today.

40mg baclofen

600mg gabapentin

2000mg agmatine sulfate

The process was honestly remarkably easy, I just signed up, told the doctor I have ""back pain and spasms"" and that I've used baclofen in the past and it worked.  I sent a total of maybe 3 messages to the doctor, and within the week I had 45 20mg baclofen tablets in my mailbox. I honestly almost feel kinda stupid for going from doctor to doctor basically begging for someone to prescribe me baclofen and getting rejected every time when getting it from one of these fast pharma places was so easy. 

That said, can I just c/t off the 8.5g of phenibut with 60mg of baclofen? I've been taking the 8.5g for around 2 months, but I did manage to take a week long break using 50mg of baclofen a day (which I had ordered from overseas) about a month in, and also at some point in the past few weeks took a 48 hour break using only 10mg of baclofen a day. My concern is that, when I did my first c/t a month in, I had only been taking it for about a month, and I was only taking 7g/day of phenibut back then. 

I could try the ""conventional"" baclofen substitution, swapping 1g of baclofen for 10mg of phenibut every week, but then the problem is that that leaves 2.5g of phenibut left that I won't be able to replace, since my prescription is only for 60mg/day. 

I got my baclofen in the mail a couple days ago. Yesterday, I tried swapping 2g of phenibut for 20mg of baclofen, and today I swapped 4g of phenibut for 40mg. So far I feel... okay. Definitely been a little on edge, mostly just feeling stressed more than anything. Some anxiety but nothing unbearable. 

I know no one can give an objective answer, because everyone's brain chemistry and whatnot is different, but do you guys think I might be able to make the jump, or should I try playing it safer? If the latter, what do you suggest, given that I only have 60mg a day available to me? 

(I know I've made similar posts to this in the past, and I apologize if I'm getting redundant with some of these - It's just that the circumstances are a bit different now, and I want to make sure I'm accounting for those differences so I don't get myself in trouble)

I‚Äòm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old (now 21). The reason for my phenibut abuse is my social anxiety and the fact that I started an internship 5 weeks ago. Still one week to go and I completed it! I abused 4-9g daily (on lower doses I don‚Äòt notice anything). Saturday and Sunday I didn‚Äòt take any phenibut as I didn‚Äòt have to work on the weekend.

Without the phenibut I would never have been able to come this far (now ending the 5th of 6 weeks) and complete all the tasks and works I had to do as an intern. It was a lot of work like presentations in front of big groups and such, so always working with many human beings. As you can imagine this is impossible for a severely depressed and socially anxious 21 year old young man like me.

If you‚Äôre interested: I already tried 2 depth-psychological therapies and 8 meds for my mental health. All without any success or effects. Right now I‚Äòm in a behavioral therapy and on a tricyclic antidepressant called Amitriptyline 100mg.

I‚Äòm planning to quit this high dose phenibut abuse after Friday next week which will be my last day here at the internship. That‚Äòs the point of this post. I would appreciate every help, suggestion or tips you could give on my way of quitting phenibut. Maybe some supplements, nootropics, behavioral patterns, routines, freetime or physical activities to get through withdrawals.

What I already use, that maybe might be helpful (?):
‚Ä¢ Amitriptyline 100mg nightly: A tricyclic antidepressant blocking the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, so increasing the amount of those in the synaptic cleft. It‚Äôs also acting on many other parts like histamine etc. and making me sleepy at night.
‚Ä¢ Magnesium spray: I don‚Äòt know how much of magnesium is inside it but I do 10 splatters on each arm at night.
‚Ä¢ Taurine: I take 3g or more of it daily.
‚Ä¢ Vitamin D & K (both 5000 IE)
‚Ä¢ Selen & Zinc
‚Ä¢ Fish oil
‚Ä¢ Camomile tea at night
‚Ä¢ Creatine: 5g every morning

Which of those things listed above might give me any relief from and help with withdrawals?

What I also have at home but not using at the moment:
‚Ä¢ Baclofen: 27x 10mg tabs only
‚Ä¢ Agmatine
‚Ä¢ L-theanine
‚Ä¢ Uridine

She was feeling bad because i cant finish during sex, she was thinking it had something to do with her, and, because of how i feel about her i couldn t see her like that, i had to tell her that it is my dumbass who makes terrible decisions and admitted why.

Im not addicted, i dont need phenibut when i am with her, but i took it yesterday.

We went on a little 2 nights out at a house my parents have in the country, so i was afraid of maybe not being able to entertain her in these 70 something hours that we would be together, biggest mistake ever, didnt want to see her like that so i had to tell.

She brought happiness into my life, from other drugs, to weed and drinking, i dont feel the need to take anything, and she did that to me, thats how important and good she is.

Just needed to vent, you can hurt the ones you care about without even noticing",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53413326}"

I‚Äôm only 24 and have a very high working memory from the iq test and just a good long term memory in general like people are like how do you remember all those details from years ago. I‚Äôm not trying to brag at all I‚Äôm just trying to explain. Every time I would usually feel happy from something like a text from my mom or boyfriend saying I love you I get this weird zap/feeling in my head like it‚Äôs hard to describe and I don‚Äôt feel it the happiness/emotion/love that I would usually feel. I have to think what is appropriate to say back without actually feeling it and it being genuine. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs blocking me to feel it. And I can‚Äôt show love and empathy towards someone because I have my whole life and now whenever I try to I get a weird ticklely feeling in my brain for as long as I try and I can‚Äôt feel the empathy. It stops when I stop trying, and it breaks my heart to stop trying to feel love and positive feelings to those that I care about but it seems like I am neurologically incapable of it now.Also not very articulate with words, memory is going to complete shit, and my spelling has declined a lot and I just feel confusion and whenever I do something or experience something that would usually make my mind feel stimulated like learn about things I get that same feeling in my head again and I don‚Äôt feel stimulated therefore can‚Äôt think about what I want to think about. I can still feel negative emotions though. Has anyone had feelings of long term confusion or have they gone back to normal and after how long? Thanks.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55181}"

I posted a bit ago about my essentially micro taper for the last little bit and.... I think I did it. The jump finally happened.

My last tiny bit was 13 days ago. I used to carry it in my work bag in case I got stuck at work and needed to do my dose but... today I took it and my scale out of my bag and left it at home. 

I know I‚Äôm in the midst of some anhedonia and I‚Äôm working on that but despite it, I have no desire to take anymore Phenibut. 

I don‚Äôt really have anyone else to share this with and I just wanted to... say it somewhere. I finally did the jump. I‚Äôm moving on. 

And those who are tapering or considering tapering... you‚Äôll get there. If I can do it, so can you! Even if I held on a little too tightly, I finally let go. 

Thank you all.",17,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5622445}"
