     Thought I would stop by and share some words of encouragement.  

     I‚Äôve been off the pheni for quite a bit of time now. I don‚Äôt even know how long. For the first weeks after quitting, I dealt with some ugly symptoms. The usual, shakes, being cold a lot, weird head sensations/pressures. 

  If you read my past posts I go into further detail, anyway. The months after phenibut were ugly too at some points, although much better. For a while during the tail-end of my phenibut usage & after I had ACTUALLY quit I felt lost and disconnected. I had no idea how I would actually ENJOY anything. I used phenibut for a multitude of reasons both social and physical. I liked how it made everything better.

      It made the leaves on trees more crisp, everything was ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù my social fluidity was spot-on, sex was absolutely fantastic, food was great, it turned a bit of caffeine + nicotine into a pleasurable amusement park ride that I was on EVERYDAY. I was using it sometimes daily, sometimes a small 500 MG every other day.

Point is I taught myself how to LIVE on phenibut. When I stopped. I had NO IDEA how to live without it. I DIDNT want too. Nothing was pleasurable! How was I going to enjoy a social outing on a beautiful day without my pheni? How the hell was I going to be a social God at my weekly get together at the bar? I attributed all of my social finesse and ability to function healthy on a chemical. 

     The lack of phenibut and PAWS short after quitting lasted a bit. Devoid of energy, drive, ambition, movitation and a sense of pleasurable response to almost any and ALL stimulus. 

     Let me tell you. Life is getting better and better each day. I‚Äôve finally connected with who I am again. I am meditating. I am eating food with gusto. I am connecting with peers, family and lover on a level that is so deep, so genuine, so REAL. It is actual HAPPINESS. Actual authentic, genuine, ORGANIC contentment and pleasure learning to navigate and participate with the surrounding world around me.

I no longer suffer depersonalization, panic, anxiety, mood swings, depression, self-loathing or mental confusion/fog the way I once did while coming off this substance.

      You will return to baseline.

     Now for MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION & ADVICE.
Dont simply stop and continue your journey when you quit. Take it a step further. It is said often, it is cliche, it is repeated and it is practical. DIET, EXERCISE, SLEEP. You must build your ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù strong. After the BASICS are down and those needs are met, it is time to divulge deeply into your own psychology and mental being. If you have unresolved issues/thought patterns/traumas/emotional pain etc etc. WORK on it. 

      I‚Äôm not here to judge. I believe that many ‚Äúaddicts‚Äù are people who are simply self-medicating to avoid disgusting feelings. My heart goes out to you. You must attack the ROOT of your issues both from a biological AND psychological perspective. 

Once you are honest with yourself and you quit substances that you are addicted/chained too. You will face yourself. MAYBE you were someone who was/is completely functional without anything in your life that is/has negatively impacted you. That‚Äôs great! Quit this shit and don‚Äôt look back! You‚Äôre free!

Or MAYBE you are someone who has not only been hooked to the pheni, but also used other forms of escape/self-medication. Be it excessive gaming/internet surfing, pornography, compulsive gambling, excessive consumption of shit food, etc etc.

You don‚Äôt have to live in hell. You can make your experience on this planet a satisfying, wonderful experience. It‚Äôs not easy. I personally feel as if I walked through the trenches of hell in order to get to this point in my life. 

I feel genuinely content, genuinely looking forward to what life on this planet has to offer. 

Get your habits/lifestyle in order. Look deep into yourself. Be HONEST and have an OPEN mind. Shame/toxicity/self-hatred & self-loathing will not get you where you want to be.

Meditation helped me VERY much with getting more comfortable in my own skin. It allowed me to work WITH my thoughts VS against them or running away from them. Your mind is your OWN mind. You must take dominion and control over your own mind.

I believe tonight's the night. I've got to come clean, the lies are what's keeping me in limbo. While back I moved back in with the parents to save money, well I successfully did a stealth detox of Kratom, it sucked but definitely wasn't hell. 

How'd I do it? Fucking phenibut. Never been so mad at myself. My work is very understanding, but I've been slacking lately so I'm worried about taking any time off. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-4 grams a day, for about 2 months, prior to that maybe 1 or 2 grams a day. Ahh, maybe a month or so. Some days I wouldn't take any, some days I'd take maybe 500 mg. Kicked this stuff before without letting anyone know I was on it, but it was a white knuckled ride to normalcy. And I wasn't on quite as much. 

Ex-Heroin addict, I've put my family through a lot of pain with my addiction. Long painful ride out of that stuff. They were proud of me, they thought they had their son back. No such luck. This will be an unpleasant conversation. 

I'm broke as shit, couldn't afford to pay for the quicker shipping. 5 days, ordered on sunday, it should be here by friday! Tracking number \*\*\*\*\* ""Your order will arrive on Monday, 8pm!"" Of course I'd probably have had a little more to last me until then, but I had me a bigger dose yesterday due to needing to be chipper for a social event. Did not take into account memorial day. Ordered more last night with 2 day shipping as I get paid Thursdays, itll be here Monday as well. Probably could've thought that one through a little better. Hour 72 since my last dose will be Sunday night. I wanted to taper, but part of me is just thinking fuck it, go to a detox center. Get through the seizure threshold and stick it out through the rest of it. What do you guys think? Idk how medically assisted detox works. I've got decent insurance.",3,0

Ima keep this quick and dirty

Recovering addict sober 2 1/2 years, jumped into Phenibut because I have sleep issues ever since I got clean. Can‚Äôt get nor want anything narcotic from dr. We tried the gamut. The whole 9 yards. I saw Phenibut listed under a sleep/mood enhancement section on the website. I didn‚Äôt do a lot of research and was common on trusted sites, didn‚Äôt do enough researching on the negative aspects (a little, but reddit could have saved my ass if I knew about it at the time). 

Currently day 8 CT.

Days 1-2: barely noticed

Days 3-6: fuck... can‚Äôt sleep at all, not a wink in 3 days. Can‚Äôt eat. So fucking nervous I can‚Äôt walk into Walmart. Stomach is tight and jaw is clenched from stress. Close my eyes and I see VIVID images and movie type visuals completely out of my control. It was kind of amazing really. Like those little spots you see when you close your eyes and face a light source... only fucking MOVIE CLIPS OF MY OWN DESIGN I mean not all the clips were good, my mind must be pretty twisted and wide open. ANYWAYS.

Day 7-8: slept 3 times for 3 hours each, what a relief. (Doc gave me Ambien and Buspar for withdrawals, he‚Äôs never heard of Phenibut but he trusts me and could clearly see I wasn‚Äôt trying to game the system). Still tense but sometimes I get real relaxed if everything goes juuuust right. 

Currently taking: 
Buspar as needed for anxiety
Ambien if I feel like I can sleep (trying not to rely on it at all)
CBD gummies I just bought today, they helped a little bit

day 8: just laid down and closed my eyes... visuals are gone.

Day 9: slept for 7 hours only woke up twice which is better than when I was on Phenibut! I‚Äôm feeling amazing right now just walking around a local forested park with some lemon water.

Stuff I took last night (night 8):
Magnesium 400mg
Buspar 15mg
Dragon ball z abridged (haha first time watching it and loving it)


Stuff I took today (day 9):
1 Buspar 15mg
1 cbd gummy 50mg
That‚Äôs it!

Day 9 8:09PM EST:

today was actually pretty nice. I‚Äôm a guy that likes to learn, stay busy, and keep my hands busy but I think I‚Äôll take this weekend to just relax, download WoW, and just walk around the forest gathering stuff lol I‚Äôll keep everyone updated

But seriously guys.... thank you.


Night 9 10:45PM EST:

Been having swollen lymph nodes in throat for a couple days without noticeable improvement but my jaw hasn‚Äôt been as tight as the previous night so there‚Äôs a plus. And I don‚Äôt really feel tired but I also don‚Äôt feel so tightly wound up as all the night before. Zero cravings. I don‚Äôt ever want to go through this whole thing ever again. I‚Äôll update this thing tomorrow.

Day 10 1:49PM EST:
Didn‚Äôt sleep great last night, got 3 hours around 1am and another 2 around 11am. Feeling ok though. Lymph nodes swelling has reduced some. All around... definitely improving.

Without boring you guys with the details of my personal life, here's my timetable for quitting phenibut at the moment: My life situation is gonna be changing dramatically in the next couple months, and I need to get off phenibut for it. I don't technically have to be completely clean until August 6. However, I have a pretty important event that's related to it all coming in early July, and I need to be in an at least somewhat stable state of mind for it.

The side effects of phenibut (glutamate surges) have made me an absolute wreck for the past few months, and it doesn't seem like it's gonna let up any time soon. So, basically, the conclusion is that I'm gonna need to be off and somewhat stable by early July.

Obviously this would have to involve a really fast taper. And that brings me to the question: how long do the *acute* symptoms of phenibut withdrawal normally last?

I've enrolled myself into an intensive outpatient clinic at a very reputable mental health care/rehab center and should be getting started in less than 2 weeks. Essentially, what I think I'm gonna do is see if I can convince my doctors to give me baclofen and valium to taper me off over the course of a week or so (just to soften the worst of a cold turkey withdrawal just a little bit). I'm aware that I'll probably struggle with general anxiety and insomnia for months after the fact, but I'm just curious what essentially I'm gonna be looking at as far as how long the worst of it lasts.

Started phenibut back in November '19 after a drinking binge and found it useful in quitting, then in day to day life. I ended up around a gram a day habit. In addition, back in March, I began drinking a pint of vodka a day and popping 5-10 10mg indian diazepam a day.

My phenibut run was about 6 months long. Vodka / diazepam run about a month and a half.

I checked myself into a hospital that does detox. I told them about phenibut but they didn't take it very seriously. They focused on valium and alcohol. I mysteriously was detoxed from the benzos and booze after less than 2 days and only 1 librium. No shakes or anything. It was unreal, quickest detox ever. 

14 days later now, no booze, phenibut, or benzos and I'm an anxious, depressed mess and I'm getting serious PAWS. Last night I thought I was going to seize. My entire abdomen started shaking then my arms.  I had 5mg valium laying around that I took just to sleep and stop the anxiety.

Can't figure out if its the phenibut's or the kindling affect from having withdrawn from GABA drugs so often. 1gm a day seems low compared to most other folks around here.

Gettin' fuckin' scared either way because I've never had withdrawals last this long from any drug.  I've been through benzo withdrawals many times. Never have the symptoms lasted this long.

Fortunate enough that today my doc gave me a gabapentin prescription.  I haven't picked it up yet but I'm hopeful it relieves some of the anxiety and physical symptoms. She said to start with two pills and work my way up or use as needed. (BTW the psychiatrist is from Hazelton / Betty Ford and had never heard of phenibut before - she had to look it up while we were talking)

22,2020-05-26 00:02:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/gqpvje/memantine_is_pretty_good_stuff/,Memantine is pretty good stuff,"When I tried agmatine a couple months ago, I didn't honestly have a ton of luck with it. Admittedly, I was using it moreso to treat glutamate surges than to taper, but I did try cutting back a bit and couldn't push myself past 100mg/day, and I ended up just plateauing after dropping 600mg.

I was doing some googling and came across a post on some forum (bluelight or something along those lines) about memantine and agmatine. Someone had mentioned that agmatine is a very weak NMDA antagonist, and that memantine was much stronger.

I decided to give it a go and ordered some from nootropics source. When it arrived, I started off taking 5mg/day, then titrated myself up to 20mg/day over the course of a week. After around a week, I could immediately feel it making a difference.

First off, the glutamate surges. I've come to realize that most people on this sub don't experience this side effect for whatever reason, so if you don't know what I'm talking about, just consider yourself lucky. My body constantly feels like it's vibrating and I'm incredibly irritable 24/7 as a result of my phenibut use.

Anyway, once the memantine ""kicked in"" at 20mg/day, I started to notice a huge difference. I can't say the glutamate surges were gone entirely, but they became much, much more tame. Honestly, I could only really feel it if I was just sitting and doing nothing. As long as I had any sort of distraction, they became very easy to ignore and weren't much of a problem anymore.

I decided to try and start tapering myself off again at that point. I was starting from 9.6g/day. The first drop I did was 100mg, just to kind of ""dip my toes in the water"" and test it out, so to speak. Since I felt fine the next day, I decided to try dropping 150mg. I ended up doing this for 4 days in a row, with no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. Since things were going so smoothly, I wanted to see how far I could push it and went up to 200mg/day. I did this for 2 days in a row, still feeling fine. After that, I ramped it up to 250/day. Days 1 and 2, I still felt totally fine. After my third drop of 250mg, I definitely started to notice some anxiety. It wasn't too terrible though, to be honest. I only really noticed it at all when I was put into an anxiety-inducing situation and noticed that my anxiety was worse than it normally would be.

Anyway, after that third drop, I (maybe foolishly) decided to go back up to 8g/day because I worked the next day, and since I work with customers, anxiety-inducing situations are a common occurrence.

As for withdrawal symptoms, they were mostly very minimal. The only one I got that was really super noticeable was those messed up bad dreams people get on phenibut withdrawal. But other than that, I pretty much just felt normal.

Anyway, I think 1.85g in 10 days is a pretty nice achievement. I'd highly recommend this stuff! Especially if agmatine didn't work well for you.",7,0

A little back story explaining my reason for tapering. This time I screwed up by dosing too frequently (every other day) where my dose went up to 3.5g per dosing day. 3g morning dose with a 500mg booster 1-2 hours later this went on for about 3.5 weeks or so then i screwed up and dosed for 4 consecutive days pretty much (2 days on, 1 off, 2 days on) and decided to see if i could CT it. Had 2 good days not good but not super depressed. Then the following day I took around 30mg of fasoracetam to see if it could help any. Went fine for 3 hours of so then became very anxious all night Super depressed and almost felt manic. Tried to go to bed around 11pm tossed turned and began to have multiple small anxiety attacks coupled with some mild hallucinations like i was in a dream state but fully awake decided to take a small amount of phenibut .7g and after 4 hours or so I fell asleep.

I suffer from a slight essential tremor in my head and it‚Äôs made me suffer since i was in high school it holds me back from living my life that‚Äôs why i got addicted to phenibut and before phenibut it was alcohol and benzos basically anything that works with gaba receptors cover the tremor completely and i felt free! It feels so good to be able to eat at the table or talk to someone without putting my hand on my chin. There‚Äôs no really any treatments to essential tremor. So while i‚Äôm tapering i‚Äôm basically just unhappy because of the tremor i envy everybody who just has rode all with the anxiety and depression. My tremor is worse while tapering too. I don‚Äôt wanna live like this so i might stay clean from phenibut for a year maybe longer and then try it again at a lower dose and just stay at a low dose at least until they maybe find a cure for essential tremor.

I haven't used any for almost a year. It will be a year in July 18th. I used daily for several years because I got addicted to benzos, opioids, gabapentinoids, and other drugs after a serious injury. I basically lost control of my drug use from being in chronic pain. It took a really long time to come off all these drugs by tapering. I failed multiple phenibut tapers by relapsing back on especially. 

There is this idea in mind that makes me want to use phenibut a few times a month or on rare occasions. I flirt with the idea of using lower dosages too around 250-500mg. To use it on days I'm really faced with a stressful activity or event. I still haven't fully recovered from benzos or my drug use though. I am currently addicted to kratom too. I take about 10-15g a day. I really miss phenibut and as my year anniversary approaches I feel like taking some. I do not want to ever become addicted through and do not want to harm my brain anymore. Phenibut really made me feel special too. Like really at peace. I really wish I can do it once in a while but I know that if I do it once I will think about using it all the time again. It will make me suffer craving it all the time I think.

It's gotten really bad in the past so going back down that road would not end well for me at all. 

Anyway I decided I would try out phenibut a couple weeks ago, was a pretty dumb idea considering all I read about it but I kept justifying it saying oh it's not really a drug and I will only use a little bit to see what it's like and what the fuss is about. I have been trying some different nootropics to try and get better quality sleep and better energy throughout the day and being a former addict, the benzo qualities of phenibut pricked my curiosity.

So throughout the past couple weeks I have used phenibut several times, starting at 500MG and going up to about 1.3 grams. So relatively small doses and always leaving a day or several between doses. I was blown away at the positive effects, the euphoria, the motivation, the socialization, and the lack of physical impairment that comes along with many other drugs. I was also surprised at the crash in the days following the dose. The Friday before last I took around 1G, was fine Saturday, then Sunday an absolute zombie. Then on Wednesday I took about another G curious to see if I would feel the same on the second day, I did but I went for a run and that helped quite a bit however that night I couldn't sleep at all. So Saturday I took 1.3G and didn't feel quite as bad but still was run down, Monday I took 300MG to hopefully avoid the insomnia and that worked. However today I even still felt a bit run down. 

After much mental battle tonight I flushed the rest of what I had. The reasons for this being I saw a dangerous pattern picking up. I quickly failed on the once a week max I had set for myself before I started. The mind/mood altering effects matched or exceeded the recreational drugs that almost destroyed my life years ago. And the crash following usage was terrible. I knew if I kept this up I would develop a nasty habit just like the horror stories I have read about all over the internet. And if that small of dose after not even daily use can give me that bad insomnia I was going to have hell to come. Also how badly I wanted to not throw it away was a big red flag that I was getting addicted to it. 

I know this is teeny tiny compared to what most of you all have experienced with this substance. I doubt I will have many if any withdrawals to battle. I don't have a months or years long addiction to break. But I am really proud of myself for throwing this crap away before it became a real problem and led to other drugs. I have too much going for me right now to be dragged back into that. I just really needed to share to get it off my chest. 

I am really proud of all of you guys who have kicked this nasty stuff. If anyone is reading this who is considering trying the stuff out, just don't, it's not worth it. If you want to use it for anxiety, please see a doctor and don't self medicate.",11,0

So my situation is a little strange. I had recently ordered 250g from my usual vendor. About two weeks ago my current supply ran out so I switched to the 250g tub (from the same vendor). That day I realized that this phenibut was significantly weaker than what I had been using. Instead of raising my dose (2.5g 1x daily) to compensate, I decided to keep it the same and tough it out until I leveled out/got used to that dose.

The first couple days were especially difficult. Aside from an overall bad mood I had a ringing in my ears, headaches, etc. After a few days the ringing had stopped and the headaches went away however the bad mood has lasted. At times I'm either very unmotivated to do anything and/or very angry and easily aggravated. A level of depression is almost constant.

It's been about 2 weeks now and my mood is not improving. I'm very tempted to raise my dose to compensate for this poor quality phenibut I have, but I really don't want to do that. Does anyone have any similar experience or have an idea of how long it might take until my mood 'levels out' a bit? I'm not looking for a phenibut mood-boost, I'm just looking to not be nearly-cripplingly depressed and/or aggravated all the time. Thanks!

TL;DR Got some poor quality phenibut. Regular dose is not cutting it. It's been 2 weeks and my mood is not improving. How long until I can expect to 'level out?'

UPDATE 5/29 in case this info can help anyone at some point. I did adjust and feel baseline again at just over 2 weeks. I then decreased my dose pretty dramatically. I dropped down to 900mg from 2.5g over the course of 3 days. This is my 2nd day on 900mg. Experiencing some mild irritability and mild depression that comes and goes but overall not too bad. Should be noted that this 900mg is probably much less given the poor quality of this phenibut. I might try to adjust more to this dose before I drop again.",1,0

Hi guys, so I was an idiot and increased my usual dosage of 1.75gpd to around 4gpd over the days when I went back to work last week. Taking doses at random times, just being completely wreck less with it. 

I‚Äôm trying to lower my dose back to what I was at and then taper down from there but I‚Äôm not sure where to start. Yesterday i barely got any sleep in the night so I took .75g at around 8am and that killed the anxiety and racing thoughts until noon but it didn‚Äôt last. I thought it wasn‚Äôt enough so I took 2 more grams around 2pm and that was a big mistake, it literally was way too much and it felt like I was rolling. I couldn‚Äôt calm myself down. I took some red Kratom and that made things a lot easier to handle but still too much. 

Since then I‚Äôve stabilized and am still good off that last dose but I have no idea what I should take next and when. I do not want to screw up the doses any more I just want it to be like how I was feeling when I‚Äôd only take the 1.75gpd dose so I can taper down from there and get off this shit for good.... any thoughts? Thank you",2,0

Well, last night, I had a smooth brain moment and accidentally took 1.6g as my final dose and didn't realize till I already swallowed.

This may be a dumb question, but is this gonna hurt my taper at all? My last dose that night was gonna be .5g (my dose the night before was also .5g, I was planning on taking a rest day last night) and I took more than triple, but it was just one night. Should I take .5g again tonight, can I still go down to .3g or is this gonna mess up my taper hard? Hopefully it's no big deal, but having trouble not beating myself up over this a little.",2,0

Everything was great at first, right through 2018 I felt amazing. Phenibut was everything I wanted, and more. I never really felt high, just content and calm. I didn't touch alcohol at all for nearly a year and a half too. Then in late 2019 I began experiencing some of the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I began hearing voices and became insanely paranoid. My dose by this point was around 8g twice a day. I couldn't feel normal. Couldn't sleep at all. Had horrible night sweats and racing thoughts. In around February I couldn't take it anymore, had visited the hospital numerous times and been prescribed numerous anti depressants and short term benzos that did nothing so I began drinking very heavily in order to feel normal. 3 weeks ago I ended up in ICU which I don't even remember and had to go through 2 courses of withdrawal using a medication called librium. I believe this is because I had became dependent on both phenibut and alcohol. It was absolutely brutal. First course ended in me having 2 seizures. Thankfully the second course worked but I still experienced severe delerium and ended up being sectioned (in the UK this means being kept on a mental ward for your own safety with no possibility of leaving) for a week. That was 2 weeks ago and I have since been prescribed diazepam and pregabalin to cope with anxiety. I feel a million times better. My moods are okay and the anxiety is manageable.

I am having sort of alarming symptoms. Normally, I would get the normal withdrawal symptoms after 24-36 hours of not dosing that slowly got worse. Four or five days ago, I began feeling sick just 6 to 12 hours after dosing. Well, this didn't seem right, and I gather that it may have been due to glutamate toxicity. But I am not sure this fully explains what is going on.

Right before this happened, I had added a few more supplements to finish up some more work before I began to taper. I believe they were agmatine, kanna extract, and ginseng. The day I took those things with my phenibut and other racetams, something went terribly wrong. I was unusually stimulated but couldn't focus on anything. Eventually I sort of fell asleep in a chair, woke up after a few hours, and went into the bathroom. I remember brushing my teeth for several minutes but I was passing out and hitting my head on the mirror. The same thing happened again when I got in the shower. Then, I fell asleep again in bed.

After a couple of days with the glutamate toxicity / expedited withdrawals, I woke up alarmingly sober. I took my normal 6 gram dose of phenibut, followed by another 4 grams a few hours later. But it didn't do anything at all -- no positive effects, no negative effects, just more of a sober state of mind. 

Well it's been a couple of days, and I began to taper. Yes, including agmatine with my doses. But the super weird thing is that I am in a constant state of withdrawals -- but they are comparatively minor to anything that I had experienced even last week when missing a dose. It actually makes little difference whether I try and use 13 grams, or 5 grams, or 0 grams. It just broke. The only reason I'm not going cold turkey (which I honestly feel like would be completely fine to do) is because I'm afraid that something very wrong is going on, and that I still may be able to have seizures or a hypertensive crisis. 

The only real symptoms I have is the usual night terrors when sleeping, night sweats, and a very weird tingly pressure above my right ear. I began wearing a hat, which makes the pressure point above my ear not noticeable. And again, that frightening feeling of being way too sober. These are NOT in any way the usual withdrawal symptoms, which would normally include a sense of dread, anxiety, depression, and panic. My heart rate isn't elevated at all. I don't even have any cravings for phenibut. My experience right now is more frightening than having withdrawals run their usual course.

Does anybody have any idea WTF is going on?

I have been on about 2.5-3 g every other day for about a month. Last night, I took about 3 grams at around 11 pm, fell asleep around 2 am and slept very well for about 6 hours, woke up still affected by it. By mid afternoon, the feeling completely wore off and the very obvious withdrawal symtopms appeared, most notably extreme irritability and anxiety. This continued until about midnight, before I started experiencing panic attacks. Because I felt the extreme nervousness and irritability, I dosed about 2.75 grams at around 8 pm. I gave it a few hours to kick in, but it never did. For the past few hours I have felt this horrible out of body disassociated feeling accompanied by waves of extreme panic. The best way to describe it was it felt like I was about to have a seizure. However it is not just panic, there is this strange out of body feeling that sort of feels a little tiny bit like phenibut intoxication.

What worries me is that I dosed earlier in the night and it literally did nothing, not just nothing, but I feel like my last dose almost is making my withdrawal worse. Thankfully the waves are not super frequent, about once every ten minutes, but they are intense. I am contemplating either going to the hospital (I live with my family and really want to avoid if possible) or taking more phenibut. 

I am worried that further dosing will just keep compounding the waves of disassociation and panic, as well as keep increasing my body's dose threshold. Does anyone have any advice or has experienced what I'm experiencing?

Edit: I made it through last night without having a seizure or losing my shit. The panic and everything else is gone. I am extremely worried about the exact same thing happening the next time I dose. I am going to go as long as possible before dosing. Also I am going to take a bit less than I did last night.

Would recommend to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was. 

&#x200B;

And I haven't even been binging/taking it regularly. Here's the story:

In January 2019 (16 months ago from now) I took phenibut a couple of times, in doses around 2g, always with at least 1 week in between sessions to minimize the chances of having a WD. Sometimes with alcohol, sometimes without. After one time when combined with alcohol, I got what you'd call a typical WD (not severe), with night sweats, increased anxiety, unpleasant chills and restless legs at night, to name a few of the symptoms.

This lasted about 2 weeks. So far nothing crazy. After 3 weeks since my last phenibut dosage I tried some GHB, not thinking about that it hits kind of the exact same receptors as phenibut does ( Gaba-B and dopamine). So just after 2 doses of GHB I got into pretty heavy withdrawal, with the same phenibut WD symptoms but this time also tachycardia and even more anxiety. Endured it for a couple of days and felt better.

The following months I didn't take any drugs except alcohol, and even with alcohol I was pretty restrictive, drinking 2-4 times a month. I noticed the hangovers were worse than usual, and sometimes I would have the phenibut WD symptoms 2 days after drinking, with extreme night sweats and so on. Even if the symptoms were most disturbing at night, I felt pretty fatigued with brain fog daytime as well. Note that I did not take any phenibut. I realized that the alcohol had to be put aside for a while, so I did just that. I quit alcohol temporarily.

Fast forward to the summer of 2019. In June I had been totally clean from drugs and alcohol for about 2 months and I felt gradually better. In July I thought the days of withdrawal were gone. In late July I was with some friends and thought I'd be safe drinking, that it wouldn't retrigger the withdrawal. The party lasted 2-3 days, was drinking pretty heavily and also did a bunch of coke. 2 days after the last sip of alcohol, I got HEAVY night sweats and all the unpleasant physical side effects that comes with a phenibut WD. I was mentally fatigued as well and fell into a depression. Not severe depression but definitely more than a mild one. I was cursing at myself for being so reckless with the drinking, for not giving myself enough time to heal completely.

This time I knew all GABAergic drugs had to be avoided for a long time. So I quit every drug, alcohol, and even caffeine (since I noticed that caffeine amplified the restless legs and phenibut-chills).

The symptoms got milder over time, but even to this day, May 11th, I still have these fucking phenibut-chills and restless legs at night. It has gotten better but is still disturbing. I still suffer from brain fog, my social anxiety is definitely worse than it was before all of this, and since a while ago I started losing hope that this will ever end. That I'm stuck in this impaired condition for good. Life is not fun at all.

So I'm totally clean and sober, exercising regularly (lifting weights and running) and limiting sugars and doing pretty much all I can do, training and diet-wise. BUT THE PHENIBUT WITHDRAWAL IS STILL WITH ME. It won't go away. I have been desperate for a while now, contemplating suicide and all sorts of things.

I have done a lot of drugs in my 28 year old life and had several withdrawals (from opiates, benzos, pregabalin) but this extensive withdrawal from something that I didn't even take much of, is pretty new to me.

I wouldn't recommend phenibut to anyone since the withdrawal is so goddamn unpredictable.

Any advice or thoughts?

So, I'm a recovering drug addict who time after time takes the wrong path with a new substance looking for an easier cure to my problems that cause my addiction.

Phenibut was beginning to become one of those wrong paths this past month.

I had dabbled with it before to help with psychedelic trips but found I enjoyed all the usual things we lived about it.

I felt like a functional person, quick witted, everything just flowed smoothly and the things I typically can't stand seemed minor. All the dangerous red flags of addiction.

Of course I am the blame, not phenibut, but I think I'm seeing that im not one of these people that can use it responsibly. I was taking a gram in the am and another 750mg later to boost for a week straight at first, nothing heavy compared to some of you guys' stories.

On the third day, I took an extra 500mg before bed with my girlfriend.
I had a benzo addiction she stuck with me through before, and a tell take sign I was on them was snoring, and how I'd be passed the fuck out. Sober I am a light sleeper.
Well this night on phenibut, she tried for 10 minutes to wake me up, and knew something was up, and declared we split until/if I could get my shit together. 

This girl means more than anything to me and I already lost her 3 days in.
Then, to deal with the sadness, I took it daily for another week straight. Even though it's anxiolytic, I still felt guilty and uncomfortable. The magic stopped working and I just started to feel dirty and dizzy and drunk, and I was hoping the dose by ~700mg daily. I saw this spiraling out of control.

I stopped using entirely two days ago, but still had my stash in a backpack in my bedroom on the floor. Rebound depression and anxiety sucked like hell, I was overly emotional, and knew that continuing use would not end well. But I couldn't bring myself to get rid of my stash for those couple days.

Things are going better with the girl, I want her and a sober life so badly, yet my brain doesn't want me to get rid of the phenibut. I considered hiding it somewhere else was the key, but this wasnt going to be enough either. I had to get rid of all the shit completely, or else the guilt would eat me alive .

Knowing my luck, she'd stumble across the stash spot and have her heart broken again. I can't keep doing this to her at all. 

After much hesitation, I tossed all the phenibut, AND my mg scale. My head said there goes my creativity, my social inspiration, my dose of feeling normal. It was so hard. I really almost stopped myself and tried to hold on to it like 4 different times. The whole process just took an hour.

But now it's gone, tossed into the garbage can, amd out of my hands. I don't want to let this fucking supplement take away a life I want more than anything. I feel suprisingly free, but slightly worried. My defense is gone and I'm here to deal with whatever wds or anxiety comes my way. But at least I don't have the anxiety of being caught with it, or being caught high.",8,0

I got up to 4.4 grams a day and started tapering. I'm now at 4 grams a day. I have a lot of baclofen, so theres no reason I should run out but I've read a few threads where people say to taper down to a certain dose of phenibut before I switch over. What is that dose and why is it easier at that dose? Also, should I just jump to baclofen or taper up on it while tapering down on the phenibut? I've read both sides of that also. 
I've been on phenibut for 3 months now if that helps, I'm definitely in withdrawal territory as now that I'm tapering I have been getting weird nerve pain, some anxiety especially in the morning, and some nightmares here and there. 
The reason I want to switch to baclofen is I'm having surgery in 2 months and would like to get it over with quicker and baclofen seems to be a much faster taper.

(Fast taper advice),"So, I've touched on this in a couple other posts, but to make a long story short, I've been offered a really fantastic, once in a lifetime kind of opportunity starting in mid-late July (not sure on a specific date yet). The problem is, I need to be sober, or at least close to being sober, by then. I'm currently taking 9.5g of phenibut and have been since October-ish. 

How realistically doable is this? With regards to the opportunity I discussed, the longer I wait to back out, the more it's gonna affect other people, so I want to know now if its way too crazy to try and kick 9.5g in ~2 1/2 months or not. I could *probably* buy myself 2 or 3 extra weeks, so early August at the latest. I can also be a *little* flexible with where I'm fully off or not by then, but I should at least be well under 2g.

What's especially good about this is that this is the only time I've ever had any concrete motivation to taper. I'd been telling myself I was gonna taper since like November, but I just never had a reason to get myself to actually do so. I honestly think this might be the only time where I've really had a *reason* to taper besides just abstract stuff like ""for my health"".

If this is at all doable, does anyone have any advice I should know before I dive into this? I just started taking memantine and I have gabapentin. I wish I could get baclofen but I just don't have the slightest idea how to find a doctor to prescribe it, and ordering from overseas would take way too long. I'm also considering getting some diclazepam if I can find it, but most places are sold out.

I haven't asked my GP, but that would be a huge longshot, as she's told me she's not comfortable prescribing psychiatric meds (she only prescribes my bipolar meds because I was already on them before going to her). 

So for people who are prescribed baclofen, where did you get it from? Did you see an addiction specialist of some sort, or maybe just a psychiatrist? Any input helps here. I've been stressing out super hard today about having to quit such a big habit so fast. It's already gonna be bad enough, but without baclofen or diclazepam or something I honestly feel like this gonna be impossible, and the thought has really been taking a toll on me for the past couple days.",2,1

First I will tell you my history with phenibut, I have had a 200g container for 2-3 years and I would do a gram once in a blue moon (maybe 2-3 times a year when stressed) that was until November of 2019. I was out of town visiting family during thanksgiving, it was the day after my birthday. I was pretty drunk, and got in an argument with my dad. I don't remember much, I ended up in jail on a non-aggressive disturbing the peace. My dad bailed me out of jail on a $1200 dollar bond (pretty ridiculous for a disturbing the peace, probably because I was from out of state. I am going to shorten the rest of the story, because I am here to tell you about my taper program, not give an autobiography. I got home, I had to drive 350 miles less than a week before x-mas to go to court. I was more stressed out than I have been in years. That is when I found that old bottle of phenibut HCL. I started out taking a gram every morning. By the time I went to court I was taking a 1 1/2 grams 3 times a day. I went to court and met the nicest judge I have met my entire life. He met with me outside of court room, released the bond and dropped all charges (he must of been in the holiday spirit, since my court date was on December 19th). I didn't even get any fines and costs.

&#x200B;

So I got back home and instantly tried to start tapering. At the time I was doing  4 1/2 grams a day. I tried cutting 100mg each dose. That lasted about 3 days and ended with me raising my dose to 6 grams a day. After trying several times, I realized I had to get my dose to one dose every 24 hours. It is too hard to taper 3 doses a day. So I took 6  grams In one dose, that worked until the evening, when l started felling super anxious. I didn't sleep much That night. The next day I took seven grams. that was a little better, so I decided to stay at that. It took me until my 5th day before I could make it 24 hours without feeling withdrawals.

&#x200B;

Now to get to where I am today. I tried several times to taper just 100mg every couple days. the problem is, even before this addiction, I had severe insomnia issues. I could kill the anxiety with supplements, but the problem with the supplements is they made it harder to sleep (anyone see the irony). After several failed attempt and raising my dose up to 7750mg a day, I decided to try something I was avoiding because of a past kratom addiction.

&#x200B;

About six years ago I was highly addicted to oxycodone, and finally quit withdrawal free because of kratom. That led to a five year kratom addiction, which wasn't that bad, because I could at least keep a job with kratom. When I quit last year, I was taking about 35 grams a day. I took a month medical leave from work and quit cold turkey. It wasn't fun, but defiantly easier than oxycodone, for that I am extremely thankful to kratom, but at the same time I planned on leaving it alone.

&#x200B;

Back to today, I finally realized I had to take drastic measures because I want phenibut out of my life. I ordered a kilo of kratom, and decided to keep my dose below 10 grams a day. I started at 5  gram twice a day, that was too much, so I found my sweet spot at 4 1/2 in the morning and 4 at around 3pm (I learned Pretty quickly to dose both phenibut and kratom early in the day because both dehydrate you, and give you the worst dehydration headache ever) the first day I dropped down to 7.5 grams, than two days later I dropped to 7 grams a day. After that I would keep my dose for three days and drop 1/2 gram on my fourth day. I have been doing this since April 17th. 5.5 gram mark, I had to raise my kratom dose to 5 gram in the morning and 4.5 gram around 3pm. I am down to 4.5 grams of phenibut a day, with no withdraws except slight anxiety the first 2 days a couple hours before I take my phenibut dose at 11am. 14 days ago I was taking 7750mg a day, now I am down to 4500mg.

&#x200B;

If anyone tries my approach,  I highly recommend to keep kratom intake below 10 grams a day, because that amount, the withdrawals are supposed to be comparable to caffeine withdrawals. This information wasn't as easy to find when I started using kratom years ago.

&#x200B;

I wasn't planning to write this much, but here it is. I plan on slowing my taper to 100mg every 2-3 days once I get to the 1.5-2 gram mark. I'll try to do a progress update in another week or two.
