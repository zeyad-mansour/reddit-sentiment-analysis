I needed a .75mg of a Benzo on day two for the anxiety. but today I feel 80% normal and the zombie disposition/lack of enjoyment are a lot fucking better. This is the first time I really feel like I can get back to being a normal fucking 26 dude. My anxiety could be better and I have trouble falling asleep but this whole experience has been so so much better than the last time I tried quitting two years ago. Sorry for the incoherence, I’m still having brain fog. No matter the dose size, I think it’s easier getting off this stuff if you take it all at once. That’s why I was taking 6gs at one time.

So I've been on 1g/day for about 14 months, and I started decreasing \~25mg a day for about a week such that I had 820mg today. So far it's been actually pretty nice I think. Yeah I get that chest feeling, but that chest feeling isn't scary or bad or even anxiety-feeling to me at all. It feels like the comeup of psychedelics or the going up a rollercoaster feeling. The headfeel is pretty nice too -- I feel actual excitement and a little bit of generic, not unpleasant anxiety, also akin to rollercoaster -- something I haven't felt since I started this addiction. I feel pretty clean, I don't know what to say. I was so depressed last week relative to this week, you have no idea. I'd almost recommend tapering as an antidepressant.

I get that I'll probably hit a wall, and I will say that I feel more irritable. But the first two times I tried to taper, I quit on day 1 or 2 out of fear. This time I'm actually going to make it to a week in a few hours, and not only has it been easy, it's actually been nice, and I do feel empowered knowing that I got this far.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8970448}"

I’ve been off for months finishing a drug program but a month ago moved into a sober living and a few days later found the original red dawn at a store. Like a dumbass I started using them again and it soon became a 2-3 small bottle a day habit (so probably up to 3gpd by the end of it). 

First— I noticed what other posters have been saying about it being “different”. That is, about a week ago they got a new shipment and I noticed I wasn’t feeling any euphoria past an hour or so and actually felt terrible, mentally and physically.  I tried all the sizes of the bottles and even bought more thinking it would work. It tasted disgusting too. Not sure if they took phenibut out or reduced it but I’m pretty sure I went into withdrawal already. So I finally decided I need to kick it while ahead. Currently on day 4 cold turkey. Not bad besides insomnia. 

Second— the last day I took the stuff the staff member gave me drug test and said “it’s showing a false positive for BUP so we need to send it to lab”. The only thing I can think of is it’s the phenibut. I looked up the test lab they use and phenibut isn’t on their comprehensive list so I felt better but I’m thinking WTF? If red dawn put some other shit in there I’m gonna be pissed lol. 

Anyway was just curious if anybody has had similar experience lately with red dawn.  Both the “changed” formula not workibg or any false positives. Thanks!",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74744713}"

First two days i was amazed how calm i felt. 0 withdrawals aparat from light insomnia. At day 3 i started feeling anxiety and depression and it was gradually increasing to reach peak at day 6. It was absolutley worst feeling, pure hell. I also was very fatigued but couldn't sleep. Since day 7 i was getting better and last two days i had 0 depression 0 anxiety and feeling lots good vibes. It was the first time in months when i was motivated at work.

Now i'm feeling even beter then when i was on 2gpd. I was good for couple hours after dosing but rebounds were always generating anxiety. Last couple months i was waking up with racing heart and weird thoughts even though i was dosing 2g per day. Phenibut calmness has got this dirty werid component.

I went to detox because the benzos got me into a world of trouble. I was taking meth and causing a scene. So I went to detox for 7 days. No baclofen, no gabapentin, but the gave me a barbiturate (phenalbarbital) sp* which got me through the worst part (the first 3 days) - only making the withdrawals bearable, but not comfortable by any means. I'm on day 9 now from the pheni and benzos. I'm sure I'm still getting some pretty substantial post acutes from everything including the barbiturate they gave me for 3 days which supposedly has a ridiculously long half life.

There's actually a shop nearby that sells phenibut powder. I still feel horrible even after 9 days. Can barely sleep and when I do I'm constantly waking up. I'm not shaky or anything but I just feel bad. There is some anxiety and just a depressive feeling that is preventing me from getting my life back together as fast as I want. I know this sounds like an addict talking, but I truly think I would be a lot more productive and not be as high of a risk of relapse towards benzos if I started a phenibut taper at like 750mg-1g per day moving forward. I don't get high from phenibut anymore so there isn't really any risk of me wanting to increase my dose.  I just feel that a taper would be much more manageable and doable now that I've reset my tolerance to a large degree. I'm guessing it would take around 1gpd to make me feel normal where as before it was 3dpd as well as 3mgxanax pd to make me feel normal.

As I've stated I'm also concerned about this lingering discomfort causing me to go out and buy a few bars... Theoretically I could just wait it out but I'm in a situation where I need to get a job and find housing asap (like yesterday), and everything seems so overwhelming. If I took like 500mg am 500pm phenibut I know I would have a much easier and productive time with everything (getting more sleep would likely attribute to this as well). Has anyone done this where they went ct from phenibut for a few days up to a couple weeks, then decided to start a taper from a much lower dose? Im guessing most people will tell me it's better to just wait it out since I've made it 9 days but I'm questioning would it really be that bad to start at 1gpd especially considering it could put me on the right track so Im not thinking about benzos all the time. I could get a job and start working out again which is always what I do in these rebounds.

2021-10-20 14:34:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qc7n46/after_phenibut_ban_in_some_states_i_believe_red/,"After Phenibut ban in some states, I believe Red Dawn energy is cutting back the amount of Phenibut in their blend, but it seems like nobody knows.","I know this is a bold claim, but hear me out. I accidentally got addicted to Phenibut by taking red dawn energy (the 2oz - 4 serving bottles) and I have underlying anxiety issues, and I hate to admit it...but I feel like a junkie chasing a high. I've tried supplements to quit, but Red Dawn energy isn't *just* Phenibut...their ""Fevizia blend"" contains other ingredients to supercharge the effects of Phenibut. 

The blend says 1306mg per serving, and though there's a ton of speculation surrounding how much of each ingredient is in the blend, I have been obsessed with figuring this out for 4 years because the effects Red Dawn has on the way phenibut is introduced to the brain and the withdrawals are completely different than someone who is just taking a comprable dosage of pure phenibut powder. Most companies list the ingredients in a blend with the first ingredient being the majority of the blend, the order goes as follows: Phenibut, GABA, Dihydroxybergamottin, 5-HTP. If you don't know anything about them, have a look for yourself to see how they increase the strength of phenibuts effects and how easily it is absorbed into the brain. Dihydroxybergamottin specifically helps phenibut cross the blood-brain barrier. 

By my calculations each serving of Red Dawn has 500mg of phenibut, 500mg of GABA, 200mg of Dihydroxybergamottin, and 100mg of 5-HTP. This is the conclusion I've came to for a few reasons, one being that each of those separately are the maximum recommended dose aside from GABA, which could be used as a legal loophole. By offering them all together you can substantially boost the effectiveness of phenibut, but it does the same for withdrawals. 

It is in my opinion that Red Dawn has reduced the amount of Phenibut in their blend and have failed to list this on the bottle (again, for multiple reasons) because it's a blend and they don't have to disclose of much of each ingredient is present in the blend. I started taking the maximum recommended dose of just half an ounce or 1/4 of the bottle, but as many of you know phenibut is highly addictive, and even though by my calculations there's only 500 mg of phenibut in Red Dawn; it's the other ingredients that make it so potent. Since I have been unable to order phenibut to continue my taper I have been taking Red Dawn to taper, and I have been able to take much less until recently.

Red Dawn has always been bittersweet, and as a lot of you will know very well, phenibut is super bitter. I have been going through withdrawals for 4 days even after doubling the dosage I have been taking of the same kind of Red Dawn energy which hasn't changed its ingredients or the way they're listed whatsoever. The Red Dawn energy I have taken recently has been super sweet, as opposed to the familiar bittersweet flavor I'm used to.

The major point of this post is so that people who may be buying this product and still going through withdrawals can stop wasting their money because it's not doing you any good, and if anything else I would like to let it be known that this is happening because something smells funny about it.

**Background:**  
My whole youth I only stuck to weed.. but when I got arthritis at age of 26, I started using kratom to kill the pain in the shoulder. But used other drugs experimental, psychadelics, smoked heroin etc. Even tried bath salts  
32 years old now.

**Situation/Reason to my stupidity:**  
I was withdrawing from Kratom, so I figured I could use Phenibut to cover the Kratom withdrawal because I felt very down

(You can skip this)  
During the first day of withdrawal, I get a message from my mom that her mom and dad (grandparents are dying, grandma only 34 kgs and granddad got a stroke) and I already live together with my fathers parents, where that sides grandfather is suffering from intestinal cancer and grandma has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  
And my father had a surgery for having 2 destroyed heartvalves. (I feel like everyone around me is going to die).

Getting the message from my mom, I get very emotional during the withdrawal from Kratom and I found out that big doses of Phenibut made me not care.

**Problem:** I haven't slept for 7 days! I think I fried my GABA-receptors in the brain.

I took approx 4 grams daily of Phenibut for 4-5 days during the Kratom withdrawal.  
And when I got my kratom, I notice that I cannot sleep anymore. No sleep for 7 days.  
I can add that I am very small, I only weigh 61 KGs (134 pounds)

Since I got my Kratom, I just stopped the Phenibut immediatly and went over to the Kratom.  
And since I slept 4 hours in total in 7 days.  
And those 4 hours were split up in 2 sessions of sleep, both of them, I woke up after 2 hours by the worst horrifying nightmares I ever had.

(You can skip this)  
**Dream 1:**  
I am in an unknown building, and I see a big humanoid creature without eyes (much much bigger than me) peaking from the corner of a door.  
I get scared and runs up to top floor and see a attic and the ""hole"" is a tight square, where I had to squeeze my body through to get up to the attic. Up there is another person who is also scared of that creature. And the only thing I could use to close the hole with, was a pillow.  
All of a sudden when talking to this new person, that eyeless humanoid creature pops up through the hole.We both gets scared and jumps through a window and land next to a horse (like wtf).  
And we jump up on the horse and tries to ride away. But all along, this creature follows us.  
In a panic, we go down in a cellar of an appartment complex, its very tight and claustrophobic, but for some reason we bring the horse with us. Then I wake up, dont remember what woke me up.

**Dream 2:**  
(This dream occured in the 4th day without sleep)  
I am with bunch of random people at a fire (like the Swedish Valborg fire).  
And we have a good time at the beginning, but all of a sudden, someone throws a can or something of liquid, and this explodes and sends fire everywhere.  
My whole face gets covered with fire and I try to whip it off, but doesn't work.  
So I grab the closest person and press my face against his shirt until the fire extinguishes.  
Then immediatly someone does the same again and throws that something so my face starts burning, this time I feel how my skin, my beard and everything starts melting and I wake up in a panic.

**What I've tried:**  
Everything. I tried to go for walks to make myself tired.  
Been laying down for 12 hours straight and not fallen asleep.  
Taking really hot showers to get tired.  
Had the window open to get fresh air when I try to sleep.  
Drunk tea.  
Drunk beer.  
Drunk Kratom.  
.... But nothing helps!!!  😭

**Possible solution:**  
Now a question I have, do you think I should take one dose of Phenibut, just so I can maybe get one night of sleep?  
Im suppose to visit my grandma (moms side) as she is going to pass and take farewell. And I want to be well rested.

Im scared that I will start hallucinating and go mental if I dont get one night of sleep.  
I will never misuse Phenibut again. I just wonder if I should take one dose to get sleep?  
I was thinking 250-500mg only

These were WDs from 3000mg-4500mg CT of Pregabalin when I had no other options so I cannot entertain the idea these were anecdotal. I could elaborate more on what the WDs should be like. 

I have repeated this enough times now to be confident about it. So I’m not proposing this would have any recreational benefit, but a last resort OTC option for about $1.

- Anxiety 

- Heart palpitations

Are these normal symptoms at day 8 of withdrawal normal? I’m not sure how much is just my generalised anxiety here. I think I’m experiencing hypervigilance related to the heart stuff.

Not for me. I get depressed in a very serious way. I get a distorted perception of myself and the world. And a depression thats so thick you could cut it with a knife.

I have not had a great experience with phen. It rarely works for me. This is my seco d time around locked into a daily use trap.

I just could never seem to get reliable results. I still ended up taking it daily to chase positive effects but now o ly because i cant afford to go through withdrawal again. 

Im taking about 1500mg twice a day. I started out much lower. Ive already come down quite a bit already. 

I know. I know. Reckless, desperate, stupid. I know what the conventional wisdom is about dosage. I exceeded it in frustration when phen wasnt giving me much effect.

I was to mention my other strange amd unpleasant side effect: i get a kind of reverse twitch.

A usual kind of twitch, as we all know, is a jolt of nervous energy that will zap at random amd usually effect things like the hands or something. Twitching means a sudden overpowering of electrochemical impulses controli g the muscles and the muscles in question with momentarily flex, erect, or extend.

I get reverse twitches.for me, i get a sudden drop in power! Say im holding a cup. Suddely, at random, my hands will lose power, strength, steadiness. But jusy for a fraction of a second.

Other side effects include dehydration and 8n more extreme cases, say, after a binge, i sometimes wake up with a sharp numbness in some tip of an extremity such as a finger or even my tongue! Its uncomfortable and lasts a few hours or most of the day.

Phenibut works on GABA and my guess is that the nerve connections become disrupted.

So about the w/d symptoms. Why is it like that for me? Do you get that too?

I need to get off of phen. Its pointless for me to be taking it rn.

My living and work situation is both demanding and unhappy. A bit precarious, too. Becoming wacked out with irrational and extreme depressed thoughts will make a bad situation much much worse.

So far for me, I dropped to 1.5g on day one. Day 2 I took 750mg. Today is day 3 and  first day without taking any. I feel a little spacey, and had a few moments of pretty bad anxiet. Also a little shaky, though I think some of that can be attributed to the anxiety.
 I'm a bit confused, because my plan was basically to take just enough to keep symptoms manageable. After reading this sub for a while, I expected much worse at this point. It's worth noting that in the past I've detoxed from alcohol and experienced horrifying DT's, so I don't know if I'm just holding that as the standard for withdrawals, or if it's going to hit me out of nowhere.

After the realization that I can slowly taper, I figure I could stay at the rate I am taking it and be happy, and after this week I can slowly taper. Well, I got a prescription to gabapentin, got some kava, bought some magnesium and melatonin. I’m just worried about what if the week never ends? What if I just constantly want this stuff to function?
In the three months I started taking phen, I re kindled friendships, met a girl that I really am into, GOT A JOB, quit drinking alcohol and gained so much confidence in myself. This week I have been reading a lot of these posts and decided I want to taper off the stuff because of how scary the come down can be. I posted earlier this week after I had a scare and my heart felt like it was going to explode. 
My current routine is wake up at five to pee. Take a n agmatine, go to sleep and when I wake up take a gram. I then take a shower and wait about an hour to start cooking breakfast then eat a full meal. I then re dose around 12 another three quarters or a full gram. Then at six take maybe a half gram or three quarters. I learned to take one last 250 mill a gram before bed to help with sleep along with a melatonin. Then repeat the process the next day. It has been about a week of this same process. I don’t feel the need to increase the dose at all. But I do feel a bit brain dead by the end of the night. 
Point being that I want to taper eventually, but need some help and support. How should I start, I know that I can slowly reduce the amount, but when should I reduce it? Like at the beginning of the day start with a bit less? Then the next day reduce the middle dose also? When do I start taking my gabapentin? 
Any info helps.
Thank you for the time and support.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4934058}"

 Now you keep chasing that feeling, of finally being on top of everyone. So why not be this way as much as you can? You read the warnings: ""yeah yeah, i'm smarter than that"". But suddenly you need phenibut at that party where everyone'll be but it's only been three days. Tolerance don't develop that fast. But then it does, so you up the dose, but the effect has weakened, but the comfortable loss of anxiety stays with you. 

So phenibut becomes a crutch. While the initial magic has long since gone you're now dependent on this drug to make you feel alright. Sometimes, out of nowhere, you regain that initial magic and you love life. But then reality hits and you're left all alone with a hole in your heart and a dependency on a drug that you truly loathe for showing you what's possible. While they go sleep off their hangover, you're bracing yourself for a week of suicidal thoughts and depression.

So we keep running after that first high, of conquering the world, of impressing all those people. Going back's not an option at this point. So what now? We try to quit but we're convinced people don't like us without phenibut. So what now? In the end only you are paying the price of playing this game, you're letting your brain rot so they will finally understand who you truly are without all the anxiety and stress.

But ultimately everyone else will simply remember you as a fake, an idea of the person you really are. But it's who they want, who they love. So what now?",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45145917}"

I sparingly used phen for years with weeks between a dose, just for social situations. Lately life has me burnt out and stressed, and phen was a huge relief when I began abusing it. I knew the risks of daily dosing but I didn't realize just how quickly I was going through the bottle. This last month I've been in denial, thinking ""3.25g just today.. no,  just this busy week, then I'll slow down"".

Finally had enough, I feel like I'm lying to myself and my loved ones.  I've mostly run out of my last bottle (~4.5g left if things get bad) but I put it away, haven't ordered more, told my bf who has been amazingly supportive and helpful through this, and it's been 5 days CT. I know tapering is the right way to go.. but with this whole week off work I just want to get this over with. I've never been sensitive to going CT on anything, so I'm staying strong. 

Started getting tremors and muscle stiffness on day 1, 2, and 3. That has mostly stopped. Anxiety was godawful on day 2 and 3, like a 4/10 panic attack for hours at a time.  Up until last night I had insomnia that i couldn't relieve with anything.  Last night i managed to sleep normally (much needed!). I've been swinging from hot and sweaty to cold, chilly, and clammy.  Feels like I have a histamine rush going as well.. the texture of my clothes is overstimulating. Today I have a slight headache but the anxiety is much less noticeable. What bothers me most is the sudden irritability and short fuse. Like I can tolerate absolutely the bare minimum interaction with others sometimes. It's not like me at all to be this openly snippy and cold with the people I love :( But overall this is getting better and I have no urge to touch phen again. 

I suppose I'm worried that despite feeling like I'm passed the worst of it, what if serious withdrawal symptoms pop up later on day 7...or 15? Can they be delayed? Honestly, while I've been uncomfortable and anxious as hell, this hasn't been too bad  compared to some folks on here who quit CT after taking much less than I did.

This is an update to my post above from august! I’m officially one week off of baclofen after being on phenibut for 1 year and a baclofen taper for 2 months. 

My baclofen taper went slower than it should of because I was so afraid of feeling like shit once I finished my taper. The past week I would say I’ve had a little bit of depression but I’ve slept well and am feeling better each day that goes by. 

I really never thought I’d be able to get off this shit. I’ve had many addictions in the past 10 years and phen was definitely the worst of them all. But I’ve learned self control through the process of tapering and can honestly say I will never touch it again. It turned me into a completely different person. I was emotionless to the people I love and almost depersonalized to everything around me.

I’ve used phenibut on and off for years as recommended, until about 7 months ago I decided to start taking 500mg a day with the idea of, well, helping my symptoms.

Long story short, that ended up being 3 grams a day after 2 months. I also developed a bad drinking problem due to a lot of trauma issues, and was drinking about a bottle of wine a day, maybe more for 2 months of this period.

I’ve since stopped cold turkey drinking (I’ve never “craved” alcohol) with no real issues at all there. 

I’m prescribed 30mg of Valium as needed a day, though I usually only take 20mg a day consistently on top of this- I do not abuse this. This has been consistent for over a year.

I am also on Wellbutrin XL 150mg.

I also have some clonidine.

I’m currently on a 2 month taper and I’m at around 1.7g a day now. I do feel a bit more “uncomfortable “ and not right, but nothing like what others have described. I’m dropping by .1g about every 3-4 days. 

This SHOCKS me given my alcohol intake, phenibut consumption, and my Valium prescription.

I was expecting absolute hell, and I’m honestly nervous to death as to why this seems to be so (relatively) smooth for me.

I believe Soma hits the GABA receptors a bit, so it could potentially help with the Phenibut withdrawals. Soma also helps with pain, so I'm wondering if it would help at all with Tianeptine withdrawals (although I don't think Soma hits the mu receptors) or just simply help out with the pain?

I also have access to alcohol and phenobarbital, if those help with either, although I would prefer to keep the use of those to a minimum.

It's got to the point where I dont even take the stuff to feel good, I take it just to not shake. I've prepared myself for the worst since I know the worst of the withdrawals are 7-10 days. I'm receiving my prescription of Clonazepam and I've got some kratom on hand too. I know these aren't cures but at least I'll be able to sleep and not shake violently and have the unholy insomnia and writhe all night. I still have phenibut but I dont want to even look at that stuff. If I have to suffer a week or a little more just to feel better, so be it.

Guys, wish me luck. And I will keep you updated every single day on my progress to kicking this shit.

Edit: I have procured some bacolofen to help for the first 2-3 days. I will keep editing this post day by day to let you know of my recovery! God bless all of you!

Day 1: Slept like shit last night, maybe only two hours. Having noticeable body discomfort. Was able to stave off an anxiety attack and mild panic. Saving Baclofen for tonight and Klonopin for emergencies. Also seemingly have lost my libido or a good bit of it.

Day 2: Felt the general 'bleh' feeling all day. Generally uncomfortable, legs gave me some trouble with RLS but the Clonazepam seems to of helped calm be down during anxiety spikes. Gonna take 1 1mg Kpin tonight to help me doze off and to keep the shakes and RLS away. (A small update. Klonopin tends to make me feel zombieish. But I have learned after I take 1mg for those shakes and anxiety attacks, then have a couple puffs from some bud it makes me feel less zombieish and even a bit motivated.)

Day 3: Day three is nearly over. The discomfort is still there from time to time, Clonazepam has kept shakes and most anxiety away.

Day: 4 Not awful but nothing of note. Moderate discomfort and the usual anxiety that was fixed, Slept alright with aid of clonazepam.

Day: 5 Seemingly alright, just a smidge uncomfortable. Helping greatly with the things I need to do for day to day life. Legs dont seem shaky anymore.

Day 6: Found myself smiling at stuff again, hoping I am out of the water soon enough. Nothing too profound, only had mild anxiety.

Day 7: I actually woke up with a smile. I've also noticed a profound increase in mental clarity. Im able to remember things and even enjoy music! When the anxiety comes it tends to die off fairly quickly. No physical symptoms to speak of.

Day 8; I took some melatonin to sleep and actually got some sleep. No more restless legs. I think it's almost over despite some anxiety.

(EDIT)  
I'd like to personally thank everyone who supported me through this week of hell. You guys have been a real help and I actually can think normally again.

I started taking small doses, 300mg-450mg daily 3 years ago. I appreciated the small social boost it gave me and the slightly easier sleep with no apparent drawbacks. Started using higher doses, 2g daily around 6 months ago to get off alcohol. It worked phenomenally! But now I'm stuck at dependence here. This wouldn't be a problem, as I'm no stranger to dependence and slow tapers, except for my sudden onsent of tinnitus.

I didn't learn long term daily phenibut use could lead to tinnitus until a couple of months ago. As a musician that's dedicated thousands of hours, and honestly my entire life, to my craft, this is concerning. The fact that I didn't have any symptoms until 2-3 days ago gives me hope that, since the ringing started just recently, it may be reversible. I've done my due diligence to keep volume low to moderate and have only ever noticed some sensitivity to loud sounds prior to the past few days.

Scouring the internet, I've found mixed opinions on the best way to quit for tinnitus. Some would say to get off ASAP, others say to taper slowly as tinnitus is psychological and a faster drop would cause more during withdrawal, leading to more tinnitus for longer (possibly permanently). Since phenibut is ototoxic, I assume getting off it faster, though uncomfortable, is the better move. But reports of tinnitus getting worse with fast tapers makes me hesitant.

I’ve had an absolutely wild/horrific ride with getting addicted to Phenibut. It’s sent me to the ER twice (mainly because I’m a fucking idiot), but things are looking up now and I am FINALLY starting to get my mind back. 

I was taking anywhere from 3g to 8g per day for about a month, just being absolutely reckless with the substance back in July. Eventually I stabilized (or so I thought) at a dose of 6g and started tapering. I experienced extremely depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, I was basically a walking zombie. My memory was absolutely horrible, to the point where I couldn’t remember if I had taken my Phenibut that day, how much I was supposed to take, etc. I was having trouble remember peoples names at work, trouble sleeping, glutamate surges (there was a time where I thought I had literally suffered a stroke, I had many of the same symptoms). 

Over the last month my mind has been improving, and I’ve finally switched over to Baclofen when I was down to 3g per day. Im starting to get my mind back, and I can feel myself slowly becoming myself again. I’m still suffering from extremely lethargy and anxiety, which absolutely sucks because I have to work 12 hour shifts and interact with lots of people. 

I’m currently at 20mg of Baclofen per day, 10mg in the AM and 10mg at night. 

I’ve been taking magnesium, NAC (1800mg), l-theanine, vitamin D, beta alanine, and fish oil in the morning. 

I’ve been taking melatonin, l-theanine, and kava pills for sleep, although my sleep quality is usually shit (waking up every 2 hours). 

I’ve got mematine on hand, but I don’t know if I should be taking it now. I also have fasoracetam, but again, not sure if I should be taking it with the Baclofen, or just switch over when I’m down to like 5mg of Baclofen. I’m interested in kratom to help me with socializing, as the last thing I want to do right now is socialize. 

This has been the scariest and shitty time of my life, and I basically want a fast track to get my brain back to baseline so I can enjoy my life again. Being addicted to a drug that no doctor has heard of or cares to help you with has been frustrating and debilitating.

I was taking 8-15ish GPD for a year and a half tapered over 3 months to 5gpd and then jumped straight to baclofen. Phenibut was turning on me and made me anxious and depressed in a weird way regardless of dosage. 

So yea I’ve been totally off both for a bit over a month. The first month of switching to baclofen was hell, everyday I experienced horrid mood swings where I’d go from feeling ok to feeling so sad and hopelessly depressed all I could do was lay in bed and cry. I’ve also had periods of pretty serious derealization where I just didn’t feel connected to the world around me. Contemplating existence and reality. Scary stuff. 

That was over a month ago and with each drop of baclofen things seemed to ease up a bit infact. And some how I’m still here, jezz I can’t put into words the hell I was in, like literally I was in my own hell. Things have improved my lows aren’t nearly as low but I still get pretty depressed regularly. 

I’m still feeling I’d say pretty strong effects of paws, strong anhedonia, periods of depersonalization and depression. Sadness, just a deep sense of sadness in my chest that seems to come in go throughout the day. 

Goodnews is I’ve made it this far. Past the eye of the hurricane if u will, so I know I can push thru this and make it out. But god damn this has been the worst period of my life.

First I wanted to say thank you for having a resource like this. Recovery is very hard, but having a community like this to come to makes it that much better.

So, I haven't done much phenibut. I just found a product at my local head-shop that has phenibut in it, Addall XR. I did my research and knew it had phenibut in it and I knew how quickly dependence can form...but I'm an addict.

So I'll lay out my use as best as I can remember. Day 1: 1.5 grams. Day 2: 0. Day 3: 0. Day 4: 1.5 grams. Day 5: 3 grams. Day 6: 0. Day 7: 0. Day 8: 3 grams. Day 9: 4.5 grams. Day 10: 4.5 grams. Now it's been almost 3 days since I had any.

So the first 2 days I didn't feel any anxiety really. But today since I woke up I've had a consistant back-round anxiety, warm tightness in my chest, cant stop tapping my leg when I'm sitting, feeling like I'm lonely and need to talk to people. 

Did I kind of dodge the bullet when it comes to the hardcore withdrawals, or can they still come?

The only thing that temporarily alleviates the pain and allows me to regain vocal function are strong gaba agonists. 

I started taking phenibut about 2-3 weeks ago at 1g, originally only intending to do it 2x per week, but the relief from the pain it provided and the great increase in sleep, made me start taking it every day. I intended to just keep doing this, as I knew I would become heavily dependent on it, but justified it with the pain alleviation and how much I could potentially benefit neuro-repair wise from the sometimes 11 hours of sleep. I also increased it to 1.5g about a week and a half ago, with 1g morning, 500mg night.

It was going well until 3 days ago I decided to get rid of the 500mg dose at night. Immediately my sleep was cut down to 4-5 hours. Last night, 3 hours. When I was healthy this would have been unpleasant, but now in my very poor health (have other severe diseases as well that deteriorate with this type of lack of sleep), it could and likely will be devastating. Already I’m suffering quite a bit. It’s now very clear I need to completely get off this stuff ASAP, while minimizing insomnia as much as possible in the process.

What would be my best taper schedule off of the 1g? I’m thinking 250mg reductions, but unsure of how long to stay at each reduction.

My next shipment is scheduled to either be here by tomorrow or the day after. I am now on the tail end of day one of cold turkey. 

I have been self medicating the upcoming and somewhat present withdrawal by getting pretty intoxicated on alcohol. 

It's a weird feeling to be intoxicated on a depressant but still be on a bit of an edge because of the restless feeling inside that the phenibut withdrawal gives you. 

I have 24-48 hours left before my shipment arrives, can I safely self medicate my withdrawal with alcohol until I am able to safely and surely taper.

If I am able to keep my blood pressure in normal range and don't have any impending doom/panic attack episodes etc. 

Let me know what you guys think.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72549707}"

2021-10-02 15:22:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/q01lif/switching_from_hcl_to_faa/,Switching from HCL to FAA,"So, I recently spoke to someone on this subreddit recommending me to switch from HCL to FAA. He said that it really help him with his taper.

Some background about me. 
I use 2.4gpd 2 hours before work. I have been at this dose for nearly 10-11 months. I had been taking 3-3.3gpd at one point and have stabilized at 2.4gpd. I have been using pheni for around 2-2.5 years altogether. 

Would it be recommended for me to switch? If so, how much FAA should I take to equal the 2.4gpd I have been taking? I’ve read you shouldn’t take the same amount of FAA as you would HCL.

Thanks for the help guys and gals! I don’t know what I’d without you <3",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5667859}"

Started using fairly lightly over the summer. Kratom/phenibut capsules. Stopped cold turkey for a week where my sleep was awful and started developing shiners around both eyes even during use. Also my eyelids and just above my eyes have turned red. Blood work and stool samples came back fine. Curious if it could have anything to do with the phenibut itself. I definitely got some stuff happening in my GI tract and have a CT on Monday.  Had some digestive issues most of my teens and 20s but I just turned 30 today so maybe its all just coming to a head lol. Any input is appreciated.,1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49308652}"

Been using it the last five days. I heard that you can become dependent on it. Do any of you know how long it takes for that to happen? I don't feel any kind of withdrawal when I wake up each morning (I take my dose in the morning) so I assume I'm probably still all right. Anyhow, any ideas? Thanks!",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.56839716}"

Ive managed to taper all the way down to .15gpd(dayish, would skip days because i was lazy and just smoked weed) to feel normal. I also had a good course of xanax to make the transition smoother.

But I just moved via a greyhound bus, I had my phenibut xanax etc all in one bag along with a bunch of sentimental shit. And my dumbass left it on the back of the car I got picked up in while stopping to get out for a cigarette in the mountains in the middle of the night.

So tomorrow evening will mark day 3 of no phenibut, last time i was being lazy and got to 3 days I felt like i was burning and itchy, nerve pain i assume. but in general i felt pretty able and alright. Just shitty enough to keep me tapering. I so fucking done with this trash and have been for awhile now, so im not ordering more. Im in a good place with a community and support group and lots of love to go around.

So any advice, comments, support, anything would be super appreciated. Ill be working a pretty cushy housekeeping job with close friends who'll stick around during my work and pick up my slack etc. This job provides my housing though so I gotta be careful, and I dont wanna be seen that way by all the new people lol.
Thanks for all the support and help you guys, hope youre doing well. Good luck have fun stay safe, love you people. Lifes a trip",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.37062827}"
