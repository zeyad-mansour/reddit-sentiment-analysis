Tapering klonopin after I Quit tramadol and kratom and antidepressants and moving to new house and selling old house? Stressed out.,"I've been confused on what's wrong and why I'm so sick. Everyday headache, stiff neck and drooling with mouth so  dry it hurts. Lips hurt. Tounge hurts. Ears ringing loud and head buzzing. Can't handle it. Had 3 seizures last month when packing up stuff but probably from tapering klonopin too fast plus stress. Been on klonopin 3 years from high doses down to 2mg a day. 3rd seizure while packing my stuff and  I woke up on kitchen floor with 3 paramedics over me. I turned down the ambulance against my wife's wishes. Why pay 1500 bucks when I know what it was and they  cant do anything to help. 


My job is remote but  is so stressful every day. 
I sold my house and had to be packed and everything out in 2 weeks. Forced my way through all that and in a temporary house 2 months till new house is ready living out of a few boxes. I had so much to get done between packing up and selling old house and buying new house in different city. 

I'm 9 months off a 7 year tramadol habit. Was hard to do. Ok fine. Pushed through. Good right. 

Im 70 days off kratom that helped me get off the tramadol. Ok fine. I'm proud of that too. Pushed through all the chills and insomnia etc. The usual. Good right. Even after multiple relapses. 

4 months off all prescribed wellbutrin and zoloft. Still sick every day. Thought this was good too. 


 now tapering off klonopin, been on years but tapering down for over a year from high doses to 2 to 4mg a day. Had 3 seizures while tapering but thought high stress could have contributed to that. Stress of moving and work and marriage. 

I thought it was the tramadol and kratom  so I quit. Still sick everyday. Then thought it was the ssris/snris so quit and still sick

Every day wake up in pain with headaches and stiff neck. Some naseua. Daytime I'm drooling like a faucet.
I'm losing it. I need help. Is it just the benzos I need to get off once and for all. 
If I take more klonopin, symptoms don't ease up like with tramadol or kratom. Taking more of that made symptoms go away completely for 5 to 6 hours. Upping my dose of benzos does not help. I don't know what to do? 

Maybe I'm dying of something else? Been this way for 4 years while  getting off all there substances. 

I can't handle it anymore. How much stress is too much to handle?

I don't know if I'm venting or looking for answers.

Ps I take soma at night so I can sleep. Without that I'd have no sleep",2

So please, if symptom talk stresses you out then I don’t mind if you stop reading.

Ok

So I’m about 6 months off of a cold turkey then re-instatement. History of use was 3-4 times a week.  Started out at .25mg of Xanax in 2017 which progressed to 4mg of Klonopin at the end of 2020. I didn’t dose everyday but that didn’t matter after 3.5 years. 

So a month ago, I got down to .5mg of Klonopin. This entire process has rightly been psychotic. But this past 3 weeks it’s been something else. I feel like I’ve been losing touch with reality. I’m tempted to ask my doc to maintain me here at .5mg for the time being because it’s been too harsh. 

I have what I think is akathisia. When I’m stressed, I will get dizzy and start to shake. My limbs will shake pretty hard and my voice breaks. My words are drawn out and I have not been eating well. 

The biggest symptoms are the shaking, the loss of sense of reality and extreme fear. I have many more symptoms but I can deal with them. I cannot deal with having psychotic episodes of confusion, not knowing what I’m supposed to do, not recognizing my surrounds and being in complete fear all the time. 

Has someone experienced this? Any insight?

My doctor doesn’t think it’s related and wants to prescribe more meds (I don’t want anything else). I know it’s related because this has never happened to me before. It’s directly related to my withdrawal from Klonopin.",4

Okay, so I celebrated a little soon. I tried to drop from 1mg diazapam to zero. I first felt fine, then I developed some flu-like symptoms, then I suddenly hit a CT-like wall. You freakin' kind-ass community you. I expected a lot of ""pull yourself up by your boostraps"" awfulness. Instead, I got a lot of kind taper advice for a 1mg dose. I hadn't even considered that, so thank you.

I reinstated 1mg around 2 a.m. I haven't leveled off yet, so I'll stay at that dose until I feel normal again, less like a sleep-deprived Pee-wee's Big Adventure. Then I'll be taking my time with 1mg > 0.75 > 0.5 > 0.25 > 0.

It would have been great to have wrapped this up, but I'm going to stop obsessing over getting this done as quickly as possible. Whenever I get this done, great. My apologies for celebrating too soon. I'm going to call this the victory lap. Thank you for your support. As I was reminded, going from 60mg to 1mg diazapam in seven months is still a big freakin' deal. I just have a bit more to go.",8

Thanks in advance for tips and advice. Here I go...got put on ativan 0.5 mg 2 x per day (could have taken up to 3 pills a day) after a really bad panic episode led to more episodes. Also, my body hates SSRIs, hence Ativan. I previously took it as needed, which was quite sparingly for those moments I couldn't shake. 

Been doing much better on the anxiety front, so I decided I wanted to try and come off. I started this Monday by skipping my second dose, and have been in CT mode ever since. 

Called my doc yesterday just to let him know and he informed me he would have given me a taper and asked if I was doing OK. I didn't realize seizures are a risk, so when he mentioned that, it scared me a little. He told me to keep going with the CT approach since I seemed to be doing alright. He didn't want to undo any progress.

Has anyone else gone CT after a few months? What was it like? What should I expect? Today I had a mini panic episode while driving (which is why I started the meds in the first place) and I'm thinking/hoping it is a bit of rebound anxiety. 

I am having a few funky body sensations. What freaked me out today was I noticed I disconnected a little while I was driving then snapped back to reality a little too hard (it's one of those, oh snap, I'm driving?! moments after your brain goes into auto pilot). 

Also having some stomach stuff, but not too bad. 

I don't feel like I am going crazy or anything. Sometimes my brain feels a bit fuzzy. Yesterday, I lost the ability to focus on work for a few hours.",3

I want to first say thank you to anyone who reads this and offers advice/support. I will try to keep this as short as possible.

My relationship with Xanax started about 9 years ago when my mother (yes, we’ve got mommy issues attached to this) gave it to me after a big panic attack. For the first few years, it felt intermittent until I kept seeking it out (they felt good and felt like a safety blanket-I had no idea of the insidious physical dependency I was creating in my body). I would say I was at .25 of Xanax daily on average. 

When I moved to the east coast(5 years ago) I had more access to the Xanax, and still didn’t think much of it other than it was a secret between my mom, myself, and few select friends. 

My first withdrawal was about 2 years ago-then it all hit, the dependency, the danger in stopping cold turkey, how it robs you of your coping mechanisms, etc. I tried to ignore it but I didn’t have the support or the courage to get help. 

Fast forward 2020-2021, i’ve gone through intermittent cold-turkey withdrawals... no access to doctors, too afraid to go to a rehab (I was taking .5-1mg a day thinking it was moderate and didn’t effect my life in a bad way), denial, etc. My own living hell. 

After my longest cutoff, I was a month clean and then tried Wellbutrin with a new doctor who I wasn’t honest with, and suffered a major aura migraine which was terrifying. I started getting Xanax from my mom again but it’s so on and off it’s driving me insane.

I’m realizing I need to switch doctors because of the overprescribed Wellbutrin and my lack of honesty. So here are my questions/concerns:

1. I’m concerned the doctor will send me away to a rehab...but I’m functioning and have a job...I just want to start a taper schedule since I’ve been on it for so long.

2. Has anyone dealt with this without it being prescribed and telling the doctor?

3. Sometimes I wish I could just have my own script and live my life...but that probably isn’t the best...I guess that’s what therapy is for.

4. I still don’t fully understand how deeply my brain has been effected by this...


So, if you made it to the end I thank you, I tried to keep this short so I’m willing to provide more information. I’m glad I found this page.",2

My last post was pretty positive as I was having a couple good days. Since then things have been frustrating. 

I’m looking for people to tell me I’m not going crazy. The depression is definitely the worst symptom for me as of late. I’ve been on 15mg lexapro and 25-50mg trazodone (nightly) for years. It’s hard not to think that these things are causing the depression even though I never felt this way when I was on the ativan. My plan is to get off of everything eventually but I must wait until the withdraw symptoms go away (hopefully they do) 

I need to hang in there and keep fighting",6

Things are not perfect, but they're way better.

I'm now 21, and working with an understanding psychologist who does not push diagnoses in my face. We focus on trauma, coping mechanisms, and self acceptance. 100% free of all psychiatric medication (I was also on antipsychotics, Depakote, and Lexapro, which I stupidly withdrew from while still having Klonopin withdrawal), and have no suicidal thoughts or panic attacks anymore. My akathisia, shakiness, and the feeling of being trapped in my body is gone. I still have nightmares, but I can avoid them by consistently meditating before bed.

I'm working on my physical health conditions now: it turns out a lot of my initial depressive symptoms were from brain fog/fatigue/pain due to untreated physical ailments, which were made worse by withdrawal. Don't neglect your physical health! Your mind, body, and spirit are more interconnected than you can imagine

Overall, as horrifying and life shattering this experience was, I learned a lot from it. I feel like I've matured 20 years in the span of 2 years. 10 months ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening, or what I would describe as a realization of my purpose and the importance of our current time to those who don't believe in spirituality. I have a solid sense of what my values and morals are. I'm so grateful to have had the means to heal this way. I'm healing parts of myself (physically and mentally) that I wouldn't even be aware of if I were still numb. I still have some things to heal before I can fully go back to school/work on a normal schedule, but we're getting there.",58

PPI's make Diazepam build up in the system, and can become toxic, they hinder the liver enzyme that break's down Diazepam which is actually the Generic version of Valium, 'Valium'' is just a brand-named version of Diazepam which is the actual drug its self.

**Top Three Most Dangerous Acid Reflux Drug Interactions**

Doctors usually prescribe benzodiazepines like Valium (also known as diazepam) to help balance brain chemicals that otherwise cause anxiety. While commonly used for managing symptoms from various anxiety disorders, Valium can also treat muscle spasms and alcohol withdrawal.

A 2012 study recommends doctors pay more attention to which prescription drugs don’t mix well with PPIs. There are several newly discovered dangerous drug interactions, specifically due to PPI-induced higher gastric pH levels found in patients’ stomachs. “With little difference among the PPIs in terms of clinical efficacy at equivalent doses, differences in drug interaction propensities become important factors in prescribing decisions,” the study concludes.

Researchers showed particular concern about PPI drug interactions with Valium, which has a narrow therapeutic window. PPIs slows down Valium absorption, since it takes more than twice as long to eliminate diazepam metabolites from your system. In other words, taking Valium and PPIs together could create toxic blood plasma levels, leading to accidental drug overdose.

**Drug Interaction During Activation and/or Degradation Phase in Liver**

Many drugs including PPIs, diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin are at least partially degraded by hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C19. However, the capacity of that enzyme is not large sufficient, thus PPI administration may decrease the level of degradation of other drugs, augmenting their pharmacological effects. On the other hand, for activation of clopidogrel, CYP2C19 enzyme activity is necessary.

Hey everyone, I have some questions concerning the length of PAWs because I seem to find myself going crazy. I was taking Xanax up to 2mg a day for about 2 months. I quit Cold Turkey and about 2 weeks later I started having withdrawal symptoms. I never experienced a crazy acute withdrawal phase but it seemed to jump right into protracted withdrawal. I can’t tell if I have been so in my head that I actually brought the symptoms upon myself. I find myself in a severe depression and with a very low self esteem. I wake up every day in a severe fog that has seems to debilitate me from having good conversations or finding any joy in things I used to love doing. They say that symptoms are supposed to slowly taper away but I feel like as time goes on my symptoms are getting worse. I find myself scrolling forums about benzo withdrawal and depression every day that seems to put me in a worse mindset and moods. I’ve always been a lover of music but recently I find myself only wanting to listen to podcasts and having no interest in music I used to love. Is it possible I have brought these symptoms upon myself through over thinking and putting myself into a depression? I see no end in site and I just want my happy grateful to be alive self back. I hate waking up everyday wanting to stay in bed while ignoring all my friends in the process. I feel like I have lost my whole personality. If someone could provide me with guidance and answers I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",2

Tonight will be 15 days off of Klonopin. When I originally jumped I made it 11 days before caving and taking .125. I am just now starting to feel more like myself again. The last 2 nights I have slept between 7-8 hours for the first time in over a month. 

I still pace every night from about 9-4. It’s been torture to say the least but in a weird way I’m starting to accept it more. It truly does hit you in waves though. Some days I cry a lot some days I don’t at all. I pretty much know every night that I will pace and be paranoid and very sensitive to light and sound and have a burning pain in my left thigh.

I had horrible diarrhea between days 9-13 as well. Felt nausea at times. I have become afraid to even go in the bathroom sometimes at night or walk over to the kitchen to grab water or a snack. I still do those things but it’s been difficult.

Im not out of the woods yet but I know that Im healing and can tell that Im slowly getting back to normal. Best advice I can give is ask for help from family and friends. FaceTime someone if you’re lonely and afraid. Ask a friend to come over. Text a crisis line if you have to. I’ve had moments where I’ve been so upset I moan for help and cry for my mom. Relapse doesn’t help either. When I took that dose after 11 days all it did was keep me from pacing. I still jolted up in bed and slept miserably and felt way more depressed.

Started at a once a week think, I'd pop a bar and feel amazing every time. Gradually though my tolerance has increased, due to me going ah fuck it, I'll take it again twice this week etc. I have never been a daily user. But my tolerance is high now even while still taking it twice per week. A year and some change later brings us to the current day where 4mg of Xanax is what's required for me to feel the way I did from 2mg. 

I take this once every 4 days, sometimes I go a week but it's very obvious even not taking it everyday my tolerance sky rocketed. 

Now I have some RC Benzos, no idea what exactly is in them but it's stronger than Xanax by a decent amount. I'd say 1 Bar of those is 3mg of Alpraz even though it isn't Alpraz, it's an RC benzo. I can go days and up to weeks without going through what I would consider serious withdrawal, so I haven't been worried about seizures, although my anxiety convinces me sometimes I am having one. 

Give it to me straight, I wanna go back to only taking them as needed and to enjoy them but I have a mental addiction and I'm starting to feel a physically addiction to. Is that even possible for me to ever hope to control myself around them again or do I have to be done. Like I said the Xanax Alpraz is prescribed and it has really helped me during horrible panic inducing situations, but I fucked up and abused it.

Sorry for the ramble, just looking for any thoughts on the matter, going through it pretty bad right now regarding life, lots of loss etc. 

Thanks for reading.

Edit, a brief background. I primarily use these due to diagnosed anxiety disorder, and it's an escape from the misery of my daily life. When I take them I feel like it's the only time I can breathe. I've been like that before the benzos, so I didn't develop an anxiety disorder or increased anxiety due to being on them. It's like the one or two times a week I am actually able to feel like a normal human being experiencing joy, even if it's only a few hours. It's sad. Everything is miserable.",1

Was up to 4mg of Klonopin early January 2021. After a disastrous start to my “taper” I managed to level off at 1mg sometime in March and I’ve been tapering that with a scale ever since. 1 month ago I got down to .5mg of Klonopin. 

This has happened before, where I wake up and I have no idea what is going on. I have a hard time understanding what’s going on. I get super scared. I start freaking out & crying. I’m a 28 year old man and this has reduced me to baby-like behavior. I literally beg my wife for any kind of help, advice or something to help get me back on track. 

Why does it have to be this way? We’re doing the right thing by trying to get off these fucking pills and this is what happens? I used to be a happy person, now I’ve told my wife that I’ve “seen my own death”. 

This is not who I am. It pisses me off that every single fucking day I look and feel like a psychiatric patient. 

I shake horribly, I have nightmares, I can’t speak properly because my brain feels slow, I hate this so much. I hate waking up and seeing my wife scared because her husband looks like a psycho. I hate this shit. I wish I never would’ve went to see that doctor. He completely fucked me up. I just want this to end. I don’t want to lose myself in this. I want to be okay for my family.

Please guys, you all are the only ones who understand this. No one else does. My close family tries but they have no idea. No one does. I feel like this withdrawal is pushing away some of my loved ones. Almost like they don’t want to see me like this. But I end up feeling incredibly lonely.",21

In terms of stomach, I don't remember having pain, nauseas or anything these days. I can remember some episodes of high acidity/a bit of reflux when hungry but maybe that's normal?

Anyway, is there a chance that PPIs could help so much with ""burning brain"" and sensory overload?

I experienced horrible tremors, suicidal ideations, and benzo belly out the wazoo.  Luckily I decided to jump off and now I’m 16 days benzo-free!

It’s such a relieving feeling knowing I’m no longer bound to this evil evil drug class.  I wanted to post this because I think far too many people are given the idea that they will surely die or come close to it when deciding to quit.

While I think it’s important to do as much research as you can on discontinuing your benzo use - it is essential for you to consider what your individual body is experiencing and to not go crazy with theories about you seizing.

I’m so incredibly grateful for the wealth of knowledge I accrued here and I hope I can serve as some sort of inspiration to other recovering redditors.

This feels strange typing but I know this is a safe place to voice some thoughts. So.. here goes.

I have been hanging around this subreddit now since January, and before I say anything else: Thank you all so so much for being here, this sub has truly been life changing. 

To get you all caught up to pace on myself and my progress: I have been prescribed benzos now for about 6 years and have more or less been on them for about 9 years. I started this adventure with .5 clonazepam and .5 alprazolam a day and worked my way up to 3mg alprazolam and 30mg diazepam a day (Yikes!).

Since joining the sub in January after a pretty nasty breakup, I have completely kicked the alprazolam and am now tapering off of 5mg diazepam. 

I initially jumped last month and was so good for a week, but I unfortunately had a little slip up and so I am back at the grindstone that is tapering.. much to my chagrin. Anyways I really wanted to just talk about relapse during wd. Throughout the months of my tapering, I have read many posts about relapsing and pretty much all of the comments were positive or read something like, “don’t worry this is all just part of the process just stay strong!”. To be honest, I did not want to believe that at first and so I manifested these posts to be some sort of cop out or an excuse. 

Having recently experienced a lapse myself and experiencing the guilt of it first hand, I truly am humbled by the sentiments of everyones comments throughout this thread. I know everyone has their own individual journey, but we all share a similar experience. So thank you to everyone who continue to provide support for each other and can still level with us even in our darkest hours. Mistakes can happen (we’re all human!), so I’ve learned to not get too down on it, hold my head up high and keep trudging in the right direction. 

Anyways, short rant over but thank you all for being around for each other and always showing support. We got this. We are resilient! Best of luck and all the love to all. :)",6

I was put on 25mg of lamictal and 1.25 mg of klonopin daily for about 3 years. I recently switched psychiatrists and I am now tapering off of Klonopin and lamictal. I’ve stopped lamictal for about a week now and i’m down to .75mg of klonopin daily but have been introduced to 15mg of buspar daily. To say the least I’ve been more anxious, headaches everyday, stomach pains, hot flashes, nausea, restlessness, derealization, etc. I talked to my psychiatrist today and they said this was more than mental health now and that I should go see a neurologist before furthering anything with my medication. I’ve been cleared over 7 years ago so i’m a bit confused. I guess my question is are these symptoms not related to withdrawal or buspar? Does it get better? Has anyone been through a similar situation?

I’m scared i made a mistake in trying to change my medication because it was making my life tolerable (but not great).",5

After contacting covid last year I can not sleep properly. I can wake up 1am and then sleep till 4-5am. Or wake up 5am and dont sleep at all. I mostly use it only on Sun-wed nights, trying to give myself a break On Thu-Sat nights. I take breaks with help of alcohol+weed combo, to knock myself ouy. GP (doctor) do not understand my issue and says that I should avoid meds. They prescribe me 4x3.75 zopiclone pills which aren't helping, and it takes effort to pull it out from them! They say benzo are banned and probably for a reason.

My dosage is not high, but should I stop taking benzos completely even tho I'm taking breaks? I know it will be a struggle with sleep  but this better than full benzo withdrawal.

I ended up in the er again and they just kept me there until my heart rate was down and sent me home with 3 doses of Xanax and told me to try tapering that . And I mean the smallest dose possible so you can imagine how that went . I was able to get an appointment for my old family doctor tomorrow and I have a psychiatrist appointment I’ve been waiting for what feels like forever for august 3rd . I can feel the end in site. I feel guilty for coming on here complaining like this because my use was so short but honestly how does anyone handle waiting these things out . I’ve tried Benadryl , melatonin etc .

Are there no long term programs that work for exposure therapy with tapering down benzos so people can function just as they do with methadone and all this other stuff for opiates,?

Seriously I've called about 10 places and their answer is basically to just go to a dual facility where you know they not only have somewhat worrisome legal rights over you, but will most likely detox you and switch you to something worthless like hydroxyzine/vistaril/etc anyway so why does it matter if you've tried all that already..

I've heard there is a totally non abusable new benzo called clobazam? Since the whole issue seems to be ""addiction is OK, so long as you don't feel too good on it"", maybe they'd be more open to that?

Anyways can of you help with a few questions?
**These may seem like dumb questions but I’d rather throw it out here:


*Do you have any pics or a log book you may have used from your taper to share? I just don’t know what numbers to expect and to see if I’m even in the same ballpark on doing this “right”


*Does a cut need to weigh the same each time when calculating ? 
Is it solid form of a pill after a cut? Do you cut down so much its then Powdered down?

*Is a blue 1mg Klonopin the same as two orange .5mg Klonopins, since they both are 1mg dose? Same in strength, other properties?
(I weighed some pills and I’m getting different weights, example: 0.166g 0.169g 0.171g for my .5mg orange Klonopin)


*IF my dose is .5mg late morn/afternoon and my .5mg is nighttime, 
how would you go about the cut/weigh/math? —I’m thinking: Weigh my morning dose .5mg on the scale, get the weight, calculate 10% off the weight then REPEAT for nighttime dose. Does that sound like a method that could work? Correct me if I’m wrong
…OR I COULD…
*Put 1mg on the scale, get the weight, then calculate 10% off that weight?
… OR 
*starting my taper at 5% decrease be better to start with?

Any answers would help!
***My current does: I’m currently on .5mg every 10-12hours… not even sure if this makes a difference but I’m down to taking 1mg (.5mg x2) in 24hrs***

Started out as needed then as my panic attacks progressed to daily severe attacks, my dosage and tolerance increased. Up to 0.5mg 3x/day — though a panic flare made not even this enough to keep me calm and functional. Ended up in the ER with a severe panic attack regardless and decided the xanax wasn’t helping enough.

My dr switched me to Ativan (1mg 3x daily) along with gabapentin (100mg 3x daily) and my panic is not as bad but I feel pretty horrible. Dry heaving, nausea, dizziness, confusion, muscle tension, depressed mood, crying, muscle jerking when I fall asleep, and general malaise. 

Is this possibly withdrawal from the xanax? If so, what can i do to make it stop? Am I at risk of having a seizure?

I know not all benzos are the same, but assumed that i’d be fine given an equivalent dose of another benzo (especially another short-acting one). My long term goal is to *slowly* taper off of benzos but right now i’m just trying to stabilize. My dr told me to hang tight.

2021-07-25 20:05:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/orn8zk/this_is_the_hardest_thing_ive_ever_done/,This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done,"I don’t really know how to keep going, *I just do*. Day 12 of this wave and two days ago marked 13 months of being sick. 

Lately, I’ve been transported back to before my 3 month taper, when I constantly stayed up late, putting off bed time, because I dread the thought of having to get through a whole new day again. 

In the last 12 days, I’ve left the house twice for a disconnected and mostly unpleasant walk. 

The memories of the walk are foggy, and so are the memories from the same day, if I try to recall them that night. 

My days have mostly lost the structure and activities I worked hard to build in, and lately I can only really muster sitting in front of the tv for 12 hours a day. 

Yesterday I was proud that I meditated and stretched as well, because those small tasks, or anything for that matter really, becomes impossible during these waves. 

I’ve started to just feel like I want to shut a lot of people out. A combination of wanting to disappear until I can make it out of this, mixed with the feeling of being insecure, forgotten about, an option, depressing and annoying. 

These constant feelings have eaten away at me over time. I have no real way to escape them. I can only sit with them and ruminate over these feelings and thoughts for hours. This is a self perpetuating, cycle of self-loathing, despair, misery, loneliness and self-pity that only proves to make me feel worse and worse as time progresses.  

I can’t stop feeling like **why me**. I never abused anything, never did anything wrong, just got sick and took medications prescribed by my doctors. Instead of getting better, lost my health, my career, all of my happiness. Things I worked so hard for. 

While everyone around me buys houses, gets engaged, married, new jobs, falls in love. I watch on as a sick spectator feeling like I’m living in *Groundhog Day*.

The weird intrusive thoughts are another element to fight. Lately I’ve been thinking that maybe there has always been something off with me, something wrong. I’m sick a lot, and it feels like I struggle a lot or have struggled with mental health. It feels like there is this darkness or incompatibility inside me, something I may have only seen in people who have ended their lives. But this could just be withdrawal, convincing me of this darkness that isn’t really real.  

Before this all happened, I fought so hard and for so long to get to the place I was in. I fought through illness, depression and anxiety to establish myself in a teaching career I loved, only to have it all ripped out from underneath me because of a stomach infection I tried to treat with anti biotics. 

I really had hope a few weeks ago but there’s only so much of this a human being can take. Especially when there are no concrete answers, no detailed studies, no doctors who will give you a straight answer or plan about what to expect. 

The only place you can go is somewhere like this sub, to hear anecdotes about recovery or *suffering*, in which many people will tell you anyway that *everyone’s “journey” is individual*. There is no set time frame, no linear improvement. Just the hope that if you keep living enough of these terrible days, weeks and months that at some point, some time in the future they will end. 

For 13 months all I have heard is **it’s going to get better in time**. But time passes and it doesn’t feel all that much better. I’ve made so many improvements, and come a long way, sure. But when you’re *still* so ill, that starts to lose a bit of meaning. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I’m hoping my posts albeit a bit depressing lately, can at least be relatable, and I truly hope the chain of them can become part of a success story one day😌",32

I am in a bit confusing situation. 

I have made three Benzo withdrawals in the past.

Each time, I had taken one specific Benzo during a few months with increasing doses, and each time, it  took me about one exact month to recover from it ; time during which I endured severe withdrawal symptoms.

This time (the fourth), the Benzo molecule has been changed every week for 1,5 month with the hope of avoiding withdrawal symptoms or at least reduce them.

So my question is, since I'm about to cease the intake :

Can I expect withdrawal symptoms and why ? If I will experience some, will they be reduced or last for the same amount of time ?

Any insight would be helpful and I thank you in advance.

Ps : I'm sorry if my English is a bit incorrect, it's not my first language.

Ps2 : The Benzos were prescribed by my doctor each time.",2

A positive mindset is by far the most important thing to have when leaving the black hole behind. On your worst days, you have to remember that you are okay and it is all part of the journey that is healing 

Ive tried pretty much every natural/synthetic substance I could get my hands on to assist me in ridding benzos from my life, some helped for a bit but they all either stopped working soon after, or made everything worse and caused setbacks or panic attacks. About a month ago I tried the lavender oil ‘lavela.’ After getting used to the lavender burps (I actually look forward to them now, Ive always loved lavender but now It’s been the most helpful thing i’ve ever experienced and it just makes me love the taste that much more) it’s effectively shut down my withdrawal symptoms along with the anxiety I already had before starting benzos. My only negative is I just wish I had found out about it sooner 

Ive taken up to 160mg a day (1 morning 1 before bed) and never really feel the need to go higher. I usually only take 80mg at night and have even skipped a few nights here recently. Your mileage may vary, but the only thing other than this that has relatively helped without making things worse is a good magnesium complex before bed and an occasional antihistamine for the nights it’s been really hard to sleep. I also have been taking black seed oil as it doesn’t cause any rebound but it seems to help with a general feeling of well-being along with alleviating some of the physical symptoms I was having. Bacopa also helped alongside these until the bottle ran out and I didn’t feel like It was something I needed with the rest of it. 

Things to avoid: 

Any sort of stimulant, even caffiene over 10mg overstimulates the shit out of me

Weed: was even helping me during the taper but towards the end of the taper I had to taper off of it as well and it was causing me more anxiety

Memantine: would cause me more panic which is odd because I love ketamine and it usually has the opposite effects

Bromantane: Incredibly stimulating for me during withdrawal and the gaba effects were negligible, ended up spending hours shaky, energetic, and lethargic all at once 

Valerian: causes rebound 

Alcohol: interestingly enough now that I’m a bit out from benzos, I can drink again. While I was tapering however, even half a beer felt like it excited the withdrawals and would throw me into a panic during the drink and I would be achy and anxious afterwards. 

Phenibut: same as alcohol but it still causes a horrible rebound, even months after quitting benzos 

Kratom: I feel like I see this suggested way too often. I ended up being dependent to kratom as well as benzos and had to taper off it. Now I like to take extremely small doses if I have pain, in place of an NSAID, but big doses will cause me to be moody the next day and not sleeping until 4-5am

Ashwagandha: Helped a bit at first but caused anhedonia and ended up setting me back like a month or two during my taper. I feel like this one would possibly be good to cycle with but I personally will be staying away from it

Kava: Another one I see suggested quite a bit. It helps, no noticeable rebound anxiety the next day but for me, if I was not drinking it religiously every night, it was extremely hard for me to get to sleep and I felt like I grew dependent to it as well 

Aniracetam: Helped until it caused rebound anxiety ~3 hours later 

Coluracetam: No real rebound but the mental stimulation and visual effects caused a bit of an anxiety spiral for me personally 

These are the main ones off the top of my head I wanted to bring to the front. There are a few other things i’ve tried and I’d be happy to answer any questions about ones not on the list or ones that i’ve listed. There are a few things that didn’t seem to cause any rebound and help with as needed anxiety such as passionflower, chamomile, and agmatine. Low doses of agmatine (50-250mg) helped quite a bit towards the end of my taper until I found lavela, now I have a half a bottle I have no intention of using. 

Hopefully this will save some of you setbacks or unnecessary headaches (literally or figuratively especially in the case of alcohol.) Didn’t mean to make this so long but I hope it helps somebody. Your body will heal, and it does get easier 🖤",19

It doesn't work anymore. A full pill (0.5 mg)... not working either. I have only been getting about 2-3 hours of sleep a night, some nights no sleep at all. It's almost 8 am and not a minute of sleep on a full 0.5 mg. It's weird because I almost feel stimulated. However, two nights ago after being so sleep deprived I said fuck it and took around 0.65-0.7mg and it put me to sleep for 10 hours... unless that was just me being so sleep deprived. It was amazing getting those 10 hours of sleep. I want to mention that after taking anything higher than 0.5 mg of Xanax I get pretty depressive thoughts the next day, sometimes suicidal. It ended up eventually going away after the grogginess subsided. I tried getting by tonight with a little less than 0.5mg tonight to try a lower dose again and nothing. My NP says I  can use up to 1 mg for sleep but I feel like that a high dose. I already know I'm probably dependent on it. I don't want to increase the dose with that in mind. But the lack of sleep is making me sick to my stomach. And yes I've tried melatonin and it fucks me up in a weird way. I'm supposed to start an antidepressant today but I'm already feeling so fucking nauseous and just pissed overall.",2

I just got done with a 4-month taper off of diclazepam. I was taking 2mg/day and I finally stopped after I got down to 0.1mg/day. I was taking it in liquid form and doing volumetric dosing. I didn't have too much of a hard time while I was tapering. Some sleep disturbances and a little bit of rebound anxiety here and there, but for the most part I was relatively okay. I was taking the diclazepam for 7 years once a day for sleep, right before bed.

It has now been 17 days since my last dose, and I have not gotten more than 3 hours of sleep a night for the last 17 days since I completely stopped taking it. It is finally starting to catch up with me and I'm really starting to feel sleep deprived. I thought that I was over the worst of this, until I came here and read other people's stories. Now it seems as though the worst is only beginning for me.

Last night I took two Benadryl to try and help me get tired, as they have helped me in the past. I got extremely tired, but I could feel my brain fighting against me, trying to keep me awake. I just wanted to know if you guys had any suggestions for things that I could do or take, that may help the insomnia and help me to get a little more sleep each night. As it is, with the 3 hours that I'm currently getting each night, it's the type of restless sleep where you wake up wondering if you even slept at all. The only reason I know I slept at all is because I have a Fitbit that tells me so. 

I have tried sleepy time tea which doesn't seem to have any real effect. The Benadryl makes me tired but still doesn't help me get restful sleep. I could try doxylamine but I'm not sure if I would fare much better with that than I am with the Benadryl. I'm a college student without any insurance, so going to a doctor to get any prescription really isn't an option for me right now.

Any words of advice or ideas for helping with the insomnia are much appreciated. I'm really glad that I found this sub.",3

2021-07-23 19:20:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/oqe1dp/clonazepam_slow_taper_experience_positive_story/,"Clonazepam slow taper experience: Positive story, in case it helps!","Hello!

I'm currently tapering off of clonazepam and wanted to share my experiences and a few notes just in case it helps someone else. (I was really helped by the Reddit community and wanted to pay it forward :) ) Here's a brief summary of the timeline, the side effects I experienced, what's been helpful for coping with them, and a little extra hope for light at the end of the tunnel.  \*\*This is not medical advice, I am not a medical professional.\*\*

I was originally prescribed 0.5 mg clonazepam to be taken once or twice per day, as needed. My anxiety did best when I took 0.5 mg twice per day, AM and PM. I stayed at this dose for somewhere over 7 years.

After learning about the long-term side effects and realizing that some changes I had seen in myself were likely side effects, I wanted off. My continued anxiety had finally recently been reduced, primarily through major diet changes. (To my absolute joy, holy crap. Still don't have a diagnosis for what's wrong there, but that's another story.)

I started a very slow taper, riffing off of the ones I'd read about. I have a LOT of GI sensitivities and horrible reactions to SSRI's, so didn't want to risk adding in another medication.

**The basic plan I used was/is:**

\- Reduce AM or PM dose (one at a time) by approximately 1/8 of a pill. Start with every third day for about 1 week, then every other day for about a week, then every day.

\- Stay at this dose until side effects mostly subside. Once they do, reduce the other (AM or PM) in the same way.

\- Initially, I supplemented with CBD tincture on days when I was really feeling the side effects. Twice I took this close to my nighttime dose of clonazepam and experienced respiratory depression. (AKA You don't feel like you need to breathe and you have to make yourself breathe or you just stop.... It was fucking scary and I stopped using CBD after that.) 

For me, trying to taper any faster creates side effects that are intolerable. So, slowly we go! 

**Some** **side effects I've experienced and how I deal (or don't):**

\- Body/brain ""shocks"". These scared the heck outta me and I wish they were mentioned more often. Basically feels like someone is shocking/zapping random places in my body/head. These go away after a few days on a new dose. They are usually worse when I exercise. Electryolytes don't seem to make a difference for me.

\- Vivid dreams and nightmares. These were \*much\* worse when I first started. They were awful and weird, and very memorable. Now, I occasionally get them when I drop my dose down, but they're much less invasive. Knowing that they're a normal part of withdrawal is helpful. I also got myself a teddy bear, and I really love it. (Check out the Amazon reviews of some of the stuffed animals, it's lots of adults looking for some comfort <3 )

\- Headaches. Normally I pretty much never get them. These guys have been a dull ache type of headache, often at the back of my head. I try to ride them out, but I'll take an ibuprofen if it's interfering with life. This goes away for me within 2-3 days of a tapering.

\- Existential anxiety. This is the one I hate the most. Back when my anxiety started, at 10 years old, this was what would cause me my anxiety attacks. It's really intense and is one of the reasons I don't taper faster, as I doubt I could handle it being worse. I notice it tends to happen at certain times of day, so I started giving myself something fun to do just before those times to distract myself. (Mostly giving myself time to play Breath of the Wild :p. ) Sometimes it works and sometimes I'm just balled up on the couch panicking. I find it kind of odd that this kind of thing never bothered me while I was on clonazepam, nor when I paused my taper (see below), but it almost feels out of my control with withdrawal. This goes away for me after about a week on a new dose.

\- Increased anxiety and irritability. These make me feel terribly, both for myself and for my boyfriend. The best thing I did was to express this to him. Just telling him ""I hate that this is making me more anxious and irritable"" and giving him a heads up on days where I'm really affected have made a big difference. This goes away after I get used to the current taper dose, though it's often the last thing to go away. 

\- Sensitivity to smells. Like all of them, even the ones I used to love. I'm already a ""sniffy"" person, and smells I normally love gross me out. This goes away after I get used to the current taper dose.

\- Loss of appetite and nausea. I'm emetophobic, so I don't play around with this one. I take Tums asap, and I drink ginger tea. This goes away for me after a day or two of dropping the dose.

\- Really fucked up thoughts. Not sure how else to describe this one. Goes along with the increased anxiety. Another reason I don't taper any faster.

\- Sleep disturbances. When I lower a dose, I have a harder time falling asleep and I wake up panicking. (I used to do this pre-medication too.) This goes away for me as one of the last things when I get used to a dose. 

\- No libido. Normally, I have a very healthy drive. Withdrawal absolutely kills it. It makes me feel grossed out by my (wonderful and loving) boyfriend, through no fault of his. This side effect only went away for me for a brief period when I took my 3 month pause.

\- Muscle weakness. I'm an athletic person, but jeeeez withdrawal can make me feel so weak.

**3 Month Pause**

Once I hit half a tablet (0.25 mg) twice per day, I took a break. I wanted to see if the side effects would \*really\* subside, and I wanted a break from them. And...they mostly did. My anxiety was GONE and I felt like a new person (thanks I think to finally getting my diet right), the existential anxiety was gone but for a couple random and non-intense episodes, I slept great, I rocked my job, I had healthy thoughts (who is this person?), and didn't have headaches, messed up dreams, or an aversion to smells. This gives me \*really\* good hope that when I finish my taper I'll be feeling okay.

**Current status**

I'm now taking 1/4 tablet in the AM and 1/2 tablet in the PM. (I did a double AM reduction, I didn't want to be picking tiny bits of pill of both morning and night.) It's taken way longer than I would've hoped. (I'm just over a year now, including the 3 months I took a break) But this slow rate has allowed me to continue functioning well enough to live my life and do my job. (Most days...)

That's all for now. Wishing anyone who is going through this a safe and successful journey, whatever success looks like for you.",32

I've been doing some reflecting and was reading my post last month detailing my horrific experience with benzo withdrawal. The story is very long so you can just search my posts. Abused every benzo. I've taken upward of 150mg of etizolam at once before. Clonazolam. Flualprazolam. Etizolam. Midazolam. Alprazolam. Clonazepam. Phenazepam. Hydroxyphenazepam. Nitrazolam. Diazepam. Diclazepam. 

Almost everything I could find. Almost died multiple times. Seizures at work so embarrassed I quit. Got thrown in jail for DUI and that's when I woke up. I HAD to FALL to get back UP!! I call them inflection points in life. They decide where your life is going. I was placed on so many psychotic meds during this period. I got a really bad side effect from ability which caused me to not be able to control my impulses. Worse then benzos. Really. I spent 5-10k in a casino one night with no memory really. Spent 8k simply ordering Postmates non-stop. Anything that was rewarding in the short term I wanted right away. Yes even sex. It was bad. 

I told my doctor and was immediately discontinued as that is the FDA Black box warning for 0.8% of the population. I remained on Prozac one of the most safe of the few. 

I am now working at fortune 500 company in biometric data analysis for covid-19. My head is so clear 3 years later. The last year has been eye opening. I almost killed myself multiple times. I swallowed a whole bottle of pills one night woke up outside. I drowned from a seizure. I crashed my car 3 times. Totalled every vehicle. Jail. DUI. Court. Bankruptcy. Now I'm pulling myself out of debt like it WAS MAGIC! my family is shocked!!! 

I have even started taking up coding and programming in my spare time. I'm reading non-stop. I can't get enough knowledge and information. 

It's like my anxiety the one that almost killed me is what is my DRIVE !! when I was on benzos my perception on life was ruined. I worked in stem cell research and bought a house and told everyone my life sucked. 

Please keep fighting guys!! I want to inspire people. You will be amazed on how clear you can think. I almost believe this was like reverse limitless shit and once it's finally gone. The sky is the limit for your brain and honestly not much scares me. 

I believe I WAS put HERE to lead the LOST souls!!!

Follow my lead. Get off these substances. You saw my history I was down BAD!!!

I had a pretty rough time with the previous cut, which was 16%, and I'd rather not repeat that if at all possible. This cut has been more bearable (although I know it could go sideways at any moment).

If I cut from 1.125mg to 1mg next time (hopefully at the 2 week mark), that would be an 11% cut vs. 10%. It would be much easier, just in terms of dry cutting, to do the 11% cut.

Could 1% really make a substantive difference?",1

Bit of a long post. I’m looking to start a taper plan and I need some guidance. I will be talking to my doctor at some point, but she (my psychiatrist) is not covered under my insurance plan so it will be several months before I can afford to go back. 

I’ve been on doctor-prescribed clonazepam for probably almost ten years now for anxiety. I started at 2mg/ day for a few years, then decided on my own ~6-7 years ago to half that dosage. I’m not sure what inspired me to do that exactly, but I’m glad I did; surely I was like a zombie on 2mg (given how I now feel on even 1mg). A couple years after that, I ended up getting down to .5mg/ day and remained there for years. During quarantine in 2020, after losing my job, etc., I increased my dosage back to 1mg/ day most days. It was advised by my psychiatrist, but I wish I wouldn’t have done it; I feel like I’ve lost the past year in a haze.

I cut back from 1mg to .5mg a month ago, and had lots of anxiety & racing heartbeat for a good couple weeks. It’s been tough, but I’m solid on .5mg again now, and I want to continue to decrease/ taper off. But I do realize that I may need to go more slowly now.

What would the recommended taper schedule be for someone like me? How long can I expect it to take? I’m in no huge rush, I just want it to be the most chill experience possible. I know it will be uncomfortable, and I would like to minimize discomfort to increase my chances of success. I also don’t want to drag it out longer than necessary. From reading here, I’m thinking about decreasing by 10% increments. How long should I hold at each new dosage?

I haven’t tried to get off clonazepam for years because I’ve been afraid of the potential WD and side effects. All encouragement and advice is welcome; please keep it positive as I know this is going to be difficult and I’m already anxious about it. <3 Thanks so much, sending love to y’all!",2

I have been taking benzodiazapines since I quit opiates probably 5 years ago with buprenorphine (still in the picture wrt treatment center option). I started out with legal etizolam... quick dependency. I got into the stronger analogues (clonazolam and flubromazolam) and powdered xanax, so i got my tolerance up really high. About 2 years ago I went from maybe 20+mg of any of those substances a day to 4mg of clonazepam and went through a few months of intense withdrawal. Then I just couldnt budge from the 4mg. I should have probably just jumped....

I have relapsed back onto some extra xanax presses with my clonazepam prescription for appearances at family funerals and things recently. Now I have to get back down to the clonazepam and it's almost impossible to function while doing any sort of reduction from that 4mg of clonazepam because I think I'm getting what is called tolerance withdrawal. I'm just a miserable mess that can hardly function and is a drag on my family and girlfriend's lives ( i feel like im holding her back ) when I make my small cuts. 

I'm wondering if i shouldnt just go against my doctors advice and maybe find a two month benzo friendly facility or... 

I really don't want to hold my girlfriend up, she has to make a career change, shes a couple years younger than me (I'm 30!) and she has so much freedom that I would kill for. I dont wan't to hold her up/i think it would be good for her to stay out of my negativity and learn about herself and we get back together after I start to feel better and checks in? I'm just so scared of going back into this,

I can't detox at home in the same familiar places. Should i try to just split an apartment with her in a new place where she is working and I am splitting rent and just try to grind it out as fast as possible? I know slow is best but slow has stopped working for me. 

 I know treatment centers are poo-poo'ed/not enough time to detox but I've made a .5mg cut in 2 years before relapse going at it for months with no improvement. I'm end up succumbing to the opposite direction because my life grinds to a halt for months at a time when going slowly and its just unbearable for everyone. 

&#x200B;

Basically, should I go for the quick treatment because I might be the exception that is motivated and fed up? (might be hard with benzo and buprenorphine but I suppose i could stay on bupe at some places) or just take 6+ months of 10% cuts??

&#x200B;

Thank you. Peace be with you all. Everything is so emotional. How i wish i would have just had something lined up the last time i got clean from benzos instead of kindling myself again and again. This time I really need a plan and a reward for completing it, like a month hike where I can't succumb to cravings....",2

I have since been tapering down from then and am already down to taking 0.5mg a day and some days i even skip the dose because I don’t feel like I need it. I was tapering down relatively fast so I did have heightened anxiety, depression and was crying a lot and shit especially when i dropped from 1mg to 0.5mg after only being on the 1mg dose for about a week I had to go back up to 1mg for a couple more days but now I have been on 0.5mg for about a week i’d say. At the start of the week it was tough I was still anxious and depressed and couldn’t eat or sleep a lot. But now towards the end of the week i’m feeling relatively normal and much better. 

I’m just wondering how long do you guys recommend being on the 0.5mg a day before i stop taking them. I don’t split it into 0.25mg in the morning and 0.25mg I just take 0.5mg when it’s closer to the time I go to sleep. 

Is going from 0.5mg down to nothing much harder then going down in dose or is it relatively similar to what you feel from tapering down the dose? 

Thanks for the help guys. Also the reason I tapered down alone is cause I think it would be a huge hassle for me to do a taper with a doctor of psych in my area of Australia as no doctors clinic’s prescribe them and I have a long history of drug abuse and an addictive personality and I guess the anxiety rebound also made me too anxious to even try ask for help.",3

Should I be worried ?,"Hi everyone, first time posting here . I'm currently suffering from extreme anxiety , and during these last two weeks, my anxiety went through the roof, to the point that I decided to go to the ER and check with another psychiatrist. I've already been seeing another one who  had me on two antidepressants ( paroxetine and mertazapine), alongside an antipsychotic (amulsipride), for the past 11 months.
After my first ER visit, I met with this new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with a panic disorder and changed my dosage from 20mg to 40mg of paroxetine and decided to remove the antipsychotic from my treatment regimen.
The next day, I couldn't stand the recurring bouts of anxiety, and decided to go to the ER again to ask another doctor for tranquilizers or sedatives(I.e. anxiolytics). Eventually I returned to the same doctor I visited the day before and after imploring him to prescribe something to calm me down because I wasn't feeling good, he gave me a prescription for Xanax for 28 days as follows: 
-0.5mg during the morning and lunchtime , and 1mg at night before bed for 7 days
-0.5mg three time a day for 7 days
-0.5mg once in the morning ,and once before bed for 7 days
-and 0.5 mg once before bed for 7 days
In addition to this, I also started CBT therapy with thin.
I'm also wondering, whether it's bad that I got on benzos and will I suffer from withdrawal or adverse effects once I finish this treatment? Since I've started reading a lot about how people are suffering from them, which is making me even more anxious.

been self medicating with 1mg xanax when symptoms get extreme, smoking cigarettes, no other drugs.

The withdrawals have been wildly up and down. 1st night felt like shit, 2nd day better, 3rd day a little better until self medicating (drinking, kratom), 4th day (xanax in morning to sleep. rebound anxiety from self medicating upon waking, take more xanax feeling better)

Everythings just shitty and all I really want is someone to tell me its going to be ok lol. 

I know I shouldn't be self medicating, but the anxiety and restlessness is unbearable at times and I've only been taking cigarettes and xanax at the moment. 

I know you guys cant really give medical advice, but has anyone been in a similar situation? Would seroquel help? I really don't want to keep taking benzos. I'm just trying to figure out what I could ask my doc for help. I don't know if it's a concussion or hppd... my head doesn't hurt at all but the light sensitivity and reactions to other drugs are concerning.

fuck man benzo withdrawal sucks I'm calling my doc again in the morning to ask for something to sustain me til my appt.

Does anyone have experience tapering off of benzos in combination with an antidepressant? If so, would you recommend a slow simultaneous taper of both medications, or is it best to stop one before the other?

I understand that this is something that should ideally be done with the advice and supervision of a doctor or psychiatrist, however, for various reasons this isn't a possibility at the moment. Any advice would be much appreciated!

So currently I decreased my clonazepam dose from 0.5 mg to 0.375 mg (3/4th of full tablet of 0.5mg)

It’s my 3rd day and I have started getting withdrawals

1. Exhaustion (feels like need water)
2. Dehydration (getting tired)
3. Increased muscle movement (shaking of legs)
4. Shortness of breath (feeling panicky)
5. Feeling of being on edge

I would like a suggestion to hear from you guys with what is the best regimen to tackle withdrawals. 

This time I am keen on tapering clonazepam and so far my journey is successful from 3 months of taper. 
I have tapered from 
0.5 mg 1 full at night
0.5 mg half in morning.

He doesn't know I've been trying to taper. However, as I've decreased my dose down from 1mg to 0.6875, I'm having next to no effects from the medication. I guess I've become tolerant to the amount? Anyway, I'm not sleeping. Or what sleep I do get is minimal and very fragmented. I mainly put this down to anxiety that is no longer being alleviated by the drug because I just can't seem to stop panicking after waking up in the night. 

I want to continue my taper, but I also feel like I can't keep on going like this. I have a definite anxiety disorder that I need help with, but I'm not sure which medications might be okay to take alongside Klonopin until I ultimately come off. Something like an antidepressant or along those lines. Does anyone take anything for anxiety during their taper? If so, does it help you sleep and help your anxiety in general?",3

40mg of Valium for 4 days,
20mg for 4 days,

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ojwva4/been\_benzo\_free\_for\_6\_months\_its\_possible/h5xh32t/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ojwva4/been_benzo_free_for_6_months_its_possible/h5xh32t/?context=3)

So many people had a lot of questions and wanted to know how I got from that scary skeleton to an actual happy-to-be-alive person. So here is a guide/anecdote of my journey. And disclaimer before I start is this is MY JOURNEY AND WHAT WORKED FOR ME. I may suggest stuff but its a suggestion based on what I know.

But that post of how I looked during that time of using is just sad. Because I honestly looked so dead I was a literal skeleton and just so sick. I mean I was always thin and struggled with anxiety and health issues, but I literally could not eat or sleep despite the fact that benzos are supposed to help you with these things. I itched my skin til it bled (looking at those pictures make me sick - I can't post them) Thing about benzos is they stop ""helping"". Which is why I’m here and six months off!!!! Started to taper about a year ago. It's long so I'll try to make it readable. If it even helps one person then worth it! So here is a conclusive post regarding how I was able to get out of benzo hell and the kind of symptoms, struggles, and successes that I had throughout my journey.

&#x200B;

Not gonna front it was literal hell. I had a lot of extra issues and I’m just gonna say that everyone’s journey is complete different (someone made a post today about that today) and couldn’t agree more. Don’t get freaked out about things I had to go through. This is just my story.

&#x200B;

Dosage/amount of time Using:

Average of about 10-20 mg a day for like 5 years....

It’s really hard to say what my dosage was because I was using for about five years and it was never really consistent as many addictions are.  


But I would say I was taking an average of about 1 mg of Klonopin a day which I was prescribed and then like 10 mg of Xanax/etizolam a day. But probably only like three years ago was I just literally taking benzo dust out of a bag or drinking liquid so that could’ve been like 50+ a day for like a year. Who knows. But I was taking pressed pills like once every hour or two. I could not deal with life.  


Medications and Supplements:  


Someone asked in the comments. Here is my current med schedule: In the morning (mornings were always worst for me when tapering) around like 9am I take 300mg gabapentin and 50mg hydroxyzine, and same dosage at noon, and then a gabapentin at 5pm. Then half a mirtazpine (like 7.5mg?) with a melatonin. I have very bad insomnia.

Unless your not really struggling with intense insomnia, I would definitely skip the mirtazpine at night as I do feel it makes me a bit groggy in the morning. Sometimes I easily skip the hydroxyzine (except morning) but I’ll definitely notice and feel shaky if I skip the gabapentin though I’d like to not be dependent on pills at all. But really as long as benzos - or some other psychoactive drug obviously. I tried opiates to get off benzos neverrrr do this. I don’t want to give this point a ton of attention but if you can’t get off benzos don’t add an addictive non prescribed med to it; subbing one for another. If it’s for a doctor sometimes that’s different but idk it’s complicated. Disclaimer I’m not a doctor.

These meds worked for me!!!! Work with a psychiatrist of you wanna see what works for you.  


OTC and herbs that helped at least a little were a multivitamin, b complex, l-theanine for nerves, magnesium for muscle aches, and cbd oil for shakes and aches. Don't drink alcohol. I makes the withdrawal sooooo much worse.  


This is just what worked for me. Again meds and supplements should be discussed with a professional.

&#x200B;

Tapering:

So I made the decision to taper about a year before I actually got off. I could have gotten in sooner but I was scared and made stupid choices. Don’t do that. Get out as soon as possible. What I did is I told my psychiatrist is kinda a mean old lady and she filled my klonopin up to a higher dose (to match what I was doing on xans kinda, but way less) but I needed the longer half life from xanax to klonopin, but Valium is ideal. She wanted to decrease me on a 0.5 a month. Fast taper but maybe doable. I wasn’t as honest as I should’ve been. I couldn’t do it on my own. I kept getting stuff thinking I needed it.

Which lead to me staying in a detox/rehab/inpatient/whatever you wanna call it. They put me on Valium for like a week and tapered me off. It was a joke but if forced me to go off with assistance and prolly what I needed at the time. Again my experience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Symptoms during taper:  


Literally everything. It was so horrible. Almost everything on Heather Astons benzo website [https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha03.htm](https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha03.htm). Which if you haven’t been on there, I would read the whole website. The worst parts of it were the muscle spasms in the brain zaps but literally anything bad that could happen was definitely happening to me. Actually the worst of this was seizures.

I was gonna post a picture of my face all bashed up and my skin all torn from itching and having a seizures which I bashed my head on my nightstand and my face including my eye and my ear lobes (I permanently ripped my eyelobe off). I was a bloody mess. It just makes me sick to see but it was bad I don't wanna post a picture. It is disturbing.

If you don’t know that is the absolute biggest chance of you dying is from a seizure. My heart could’ve just stopped during a seizure just like that. This is what scared me for so long and it is a legit (but more than unlikely) fear. If you think this is a legitimate issue, I would go to your psychiatrist/doctor and tell them that you know you you are afraid of having a seizure and they can put you on some type of Anti-convulsant. I’m pretty sure they gave me something called Keppra when I was in in-patient.

Other symptoms included restlessness, insomnia, nightmares, panic attacks, agoraphobia, eye issues, depersonalization, depression, paranoia, intrusive memories, headaches, muscle twitches, dizziness, tinnitus, stomach issues, hypersensitivity, and heart palpitations. The list goes on...  


&#x200B;

Detox/Inpatient:  


So there’s a lot of controversy about detox and benzos and I completely understand why. Not a lot of people working in recoveries or even in psychiatry really understand the dangers of getting off of benzos which is literally the worst part but if you were really really struggling like months have gone by and you really can’t stick to a taper schedule or work with your psychiatrist just check yourself into a 30 day detox. For me I reached the point where I didn’t think I could stop on my own and just was getting worse so my parents kinda forced me to go. It cost a fortune and I did not have the best experience at all in terms of how it was run, but it was time off the benzos where I had no opportunity to relapse back in even if I wanted to.

&#x200B;

Programs/Groups:

Just a suggestion. I'm talking like recovery based programs/groups. Like 12 steps. I’ve been to a few meeting in person but I prefer online. I do run a meeting on a discord which helps keep me on track and helping others [https://discord.gg/bfX9f7PW](https://discord.gg/bfX9f7PW). message me for the link if that doesn't work.  


If you feel you need a community or people who are sober to connect with just go check it out. No harm. If na isn’t your thing(which it totally isn’t for me) then checkout smart recovery. It’s very evident, cognitive behavior based and easy to follow. A program is just a suggestion to help keep you accountable.  


I would suggest some kinda group or a therapist/psychiatrist to talk to through this. Use that discord page (I have a few addiction ones) or just find a buddy here on Reddit. Don't expect people who haven't gone thru it to understand.

As many have said be VERY WEARY OF READING OTHERS STORIES (def including mine!) but one other reason is people talking about their symptoms tend to add to the natural paranoia.  


&#x200B;

What helped during/after taper?:  


During taper I literally just spent days in bed just in pain but I wish that I just did more than just that as sitting around just makes you focus on the pain. But COVID and people were self isolated anyways so that made it hard. I read stats that drug use has gone up.  


There were things that made things better so gonna focus on those. I think telling myself that It WILL get better was so helpful. I really dove into hobbies like reading, watched a lot of shows/movies (marvel marathon), started some new video games, worked on my music, focused on my dogs and cats, went on light hikes, and started going to the gym.

I can not stress it enough the NUMBER ONE THING THAT WILL HELP SPEED UP THE PROCESS IS EXERCISEEEEEEEEEEEE. I started just doing yoga (YogaWithAdrienne 90 days playlist on youtube) and kinda doing push-ups, sit-ups, squats, etc for at least half an hour everyday. I used to think I just wasn’t feeling well enough to work out and go to the gym but I was so wrong. Maybe at the beginning but It wasn’t until I was doing this consistently every day that I really notice a difference. So whether it’s going on a run or a swim or a hike or the gym just get out and do something active to get out of your head. Whatever gets you moving.  


Another thing that was really a struggle during Covid was feeling isolated. Literally just get yourself to a store or out to food and just smile politely at people. Calling your friend or family member always helps.

Nowadays I focus on my relationships and hobbies and work and how far I’ve come. Like it blows my mind. I have a full-time new job I just started and really enjoy it so far. Even though it’s kind of overwhelming to learn a lot at times. I’m also taking online coding classes just for the sake of education and wanting to learn more and better myself. I am reconnecting with friends I lost and have been going on hikes and to the beach and just catching up on life and feeling alive. I wish I did this sooner but I’m going to enjoy what I’ve got left and help people along the way. If you wanna message me with any questions I would be happy to help out and give any advice or support.

Keep fighting the good fight and do not give up! It is so worth it to be on the other side! :)",11

I had a bad mental health crisis which I am still dealing with and got put on benzos to help manage the anxiety. I have been using benzos for a span of 56 days now.

I have been tapering and am now on 0.625mg of K and am ready to jump to 0.500mg and then remain there for a bit.

I am already feeling the withdrawals despite what the psychiatrists are saying can't be true: the anxiety, dissociation, and weird muscles aches and bodily sensations. Thankfully these aren't too bad. The worst thing I am experiencing though is this profound and extreme depression that seems to hit waves. That honestly to me is the worst part. Being on K has me depressed anyways but I noticed it got worse when I tapered. The same thing happened when I was on and then went off of Gabapentin.

\- I'm starting to feel numbness in my right arm

Scared of withdrawal….,"Long story short, I was suffering through a sickness that set my anxiety off the charts a month ago. I started to depend on my Xanax more often at that time. Not taking it everyday but every other to every few days. This was the .5mg dose mainly. So about a week ago I kept getting panic attacks and realized it was when I wasn’t taking my pill. So I looked things up  and saw all about benzo withdrawal and got scared. I decided to just stop and it was bad. On the third day I felt so sick  and like I was gonna die. So I took a .5mg and it all went away. Now I am on the third day of taking .25mg and plan to cut that in half soon. I’m seeing my doc on Wednesday to get a tapering schedule but I don’t know if I’m letting my fears make the withdrawal worse or if I’m really already dependent on it. Anyways I just want to know if tapering will make this time easier and how long do u think the tapering will last? I just need comfort right now. Thanks…",2

Attacks in which I thought were heart attacks— causing palpitations etc. Almost four years I experienced heart attack symptoms, gasping for air at night while many different things.

I have been prescribed 0.5mg of Alprazolam, in which ever since taking it I have only EVER taken half the pill, 0.25mg. This was in 14ct’s and I have had two prescriptions. That would be 28 doses per prescription, totaling 56 days of 0.25mg once a night.

This alprazolam has helped me, so damn much. I can sleep easy— but it terrifies me to see such crazy and deadly withdrawal symptoms. As much as it helps me, I don’t want to use benzos anymore. At this point I worry I will have acquired a dependence, I still have about 12 doses to use to taper but I am unsure of how to do so carefully. Especially since I am taking such a low amount. Regardless of the amount our bodies get addicted to a substance and react accordingly, no? I assume to experience the least amount of withdrawals in the safest way possible, I’ll have to taper down by halves in grams until, inevitably, I don’t take doses at all",2

I've noticed that the two biggest symptoms I have are constipation and muscle pain in the upper body. It hurts on my side when I sleep on my left, when I lay on my back it hurts in my back, and when I lay on my right I get weird twinges in my back. Because of this and getting up to use the bathroom constantly I find it very hard to sleep.  


Does anyone have any suggestions with how to cope with this? For constipation, I've tried laxatives and Metamucil. Nothing really works. Well, coffee sort of worked but I can't have that. And for muscle pain, Aleve helps but I don't want to damage my liver by keep taking that. I've tried ice compresses but that only does so much.

I got 30 x 10mg Diazepam to do this switch and that's it so i am going to try to fast taper and jump. If it does not work prob go back on Clonazepam.

My taper or rather a direct switch is to take: 

Day 1- 2: 5mg Diazepam and 0.75mg Clonazepam
Day 3: 10mg Dianazepam and 0.5mg Clonazepam 
Day 4 - 11 10mg-15mg  Diazepam and 0 clonazepam with 300mg Gabapentin per day.

Day 12- 19 10mg Diazepam
Day 19- 26 0.7mg Diazepam
Day 26-33 days 0.5mg Diazepam with 300mg gabapentin and then jump with 2 weeks 300mg gabapentin per day, then jump Gapapentin.

“after doing some reviewing/thinking regarding continued weaning of your alprazolam I Would next recommend to wean to 0.125mg once daily in am and 0.25mg once daily in PM x 2 weeks, then 0.125mg twice Daily x 2 weeks, then 0.125mg once daily x 2 weeks, then every other day and continue to decrease frequency weeky until off. In order to do this I'll have to send in new script for the 0.25mg tablet and would recommend you turn in the 0.5mg tablet. What are you thoughts on this. With reduction in your use of the alprazolam you may have more anxiety and possibly some changes in sleep. We can discuss recommendations for how to manage this through alternative (safer) medications and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. I am also open to consulting with the clinical pharmacist to discuss options for weaning. let me know your thoughts.”  

What do you all think and how shall I respond to my doctor?",1

The thought of going back to life before I could relax scares me. But at the same time my life is passing me by while I’m on overdrive. 

I’m telling you I had 3 panic attacks a day that would last up to 120 minutes each. Rapid heart beat, numbness in hands and face, hyperventilating, tunnel vision, unable to speak, shaking. I used to call an ambulance twice a week before my doctor put me on a medication that blessed me, and also messed me...

I really could use feedback. Honest feedback. Do I stay on the medication forever? Are my GABA receptors fried. Is it even worth coming off the medication with severe generational panic attacks. This runs deep in my family tree. Agoraphobia, electro shock type stuff in my family tree. 

I honestly think I may have the worst attacks on the planet.

is this common during benzo tapering? or could there be something else going on? anbody experience this? im so close to the finish line and look forward to start my healing just wondering if this is gonna continue or go away once im off and start my healing.

any and all advice or responses are greatly appreciated thank you.

background was using etizolam to assist in getting of phenibut (9 months clean today =) ) got addicted and decided to use diclazepam to make myself more comfortable while my gaba b receptors healed. so i stayed at 2mgs for 3months, then had a 2 week period were i ramped up my dosage and had to restart taper. so all together been using diclazepam 9months and most of its been tapering. thanks.",4

Am now down to 0.3125 and plan to get to 0.25 within 6 weeks. My jumps have been big and I want to slow it down. 

a compound pharmacy near me just recommended this for when I reach 0.25. 

Hold 0.25 for a month
Taper to 0.15 for a month 
Taper to 0.5 for a month 
Drop 

Most of the tapers I see online are for 2 week holds and 5-10% drops. The pharmacist had a pretty different idea. He said a one month hold often allows for bigger drops, and that many customers have followed this schedule. Thoughts? 

My tentative plan is fairly rapid but definitely slower than the pharmacy’s. It uses .125 pills only and cuts into quarters. Some have told me it’s too fast. But doing a slower approach requires all these work intensive processes like liquid titrations or making capsules yourself or paying a hefty price for compounding. I want to keep it simple. My thinking is to do this schedule and hold for 3-4 weeks per dose. Any feedback?

The Gabapentin seems to be helping. 

I also have restless leg syndrome but I take a dopamine agonist for it, though I know Gabapentin is also used for restless legs so I get added benefit there.  

I just learned Gabapentin can be addictive and has benzo like withdrawal symptoms. Yikes. I am on a lot of meds and I’m concerned about this. Though the drug might be helping, I’m tempted to tell my doctor I want off Gabapentin. 

Is tapering off two meds at once a bad idea? Or am I better off staying on Gabapentin during the Kilonopin tapering and then taper off Gabapentin afterwards? 

The doctor is not conservative and he’d just say to stop taking Gabapentin if he agreed with me to abandon the med but I’d want to do a taper.

However, I just recently got worked up for some pain related issues that I suspected may not be related to my benzo use, and lo and behold, I actually have a second issue to deal with in addition to getting off these benzos (nerve damage from a prior injury). 

The physician (not a psychiatrist, a physical medicine and rehabilitation doctor) is recommending gabapentin. I've been dealing with this pain for over a year, and when compounded with the issues from my taper, life feels pretty unbearable a lot of the time.

The gabapentin *may* kill two birds with one stone--help the nerve pain and also lessen my taper symptoms. I hate the idea of trading one problem for another, but I have a hard time imagining living with this pain into perpetuity. Trying to treat this pain with tramadol is what actually provoked an inadvertent benzo CT and eventual reinstatement--I was advised to not take my benzos with it, but wasn't warned of withdrawal and I haven't been right since--now tapering.

Anybody relate to this?,"I was always a 'creative type.' I started writing short stories and poems when I was 7, and I was extremely prolific. The years went by, I got bullied at school, my father was abusive and I started feeling a deep anguish and sadness. I stopped writing and thought constantly about suicide by the time I was 13. I eventually found some new interests that made me want to live, realized that school would be over one day and went back to writing at about 16/17. This also helped me connect with other writers, and I started developing a social life. It wasn't perfect but it was better than just being in my room.

I was working on my first novel when I had my first panic attack, and this in turn made me develop agoraphobia. By the time I turned 22 I was on Klonopin/Lexapro, though the doctor changed the Lexapro for Prozac, Zoloft, and Pristiq during several periods. He also suggested antipsychotics at one point, so I tried Zyprexa and Seroquel, but they only made me sleep, so I got off them. (Just to be clear, my only issue is anxiety. I haven't been diagnosed with any chronic mental disorder.)

Out of all of these medications, the only one I got to love was Klonopin. (Of course, it's a benzo, how could I not?!) I am normally awkward around people I don't know very well, but the Klonopin made me talkative and brought out all of my charismatic qualities. With the Klonopin, it's like all the fears and inhibitions slide away like passing clouds and my real self gets to shine through. Does this make any sense? I googled ""klonopin+creativity"" several times and all the results are on the line of klonopin *dampening* creativity instead of helping it, but why do I feel like it's the opposite? If anything, the SSRI was making me numb (or that's what I told myself), but not the Klonopin.

This year, after realizing that the Zoloft was doing nothing for me and that I still was agoraphobic and that the only way to confront it was exposure, I left it. I tapered off slowly and don't miss it one bit. But yesterday, after weeks of being in my room with nothing to do, and after I-don't-remember-how-long of not finding joy in creative activities (my novel is still unfinished!) I took 2 mg of Klonopin I had saved. And it felt so good. I was able to write down ideas and even had a lot of realizations about myself. Does anybody relate? Without the Klonopin I was paralyzed, going through the motions of daily lockdown life, not feeling motivation or anything at all.

The bottom line is that I miss the creative girl that I was, but I need to get back to her without the help of any substance. I haven't seen my psychiatrist for like six months since I left the pills, and there's no way I could get Klonopin once I finish the few pills I have left. And yes: I know I shouldn't have done this on my own, but my psychiatrist had NO INTENTION of getting me off the Zoloft any time soon, she was willing to up the dose in any case, and I felt trapped. I just wish I had an endless supply of Klonopin or of something that makes me feel as free as Klonopin does.",1

Really just on edge.  Was using 6-30mg of alprazolam for about a month.  Did have a seizure couple weeks age after I didn't get 3 days of 120mg methadone from my clinic.  Seized after having to break down and beg to not be dropped to 30mg.  Had just taken first 2mg of xan 20mins before and did some H like 60mins before, got my methadone reinstated like 3 hours before.

But I'm glad this isn't too horrible, I'm still on the Methadone and heroin, but have kicked benzos on them and had a worse time.  

My taper was 6mg-5mg-4mg-3mg-2mg-1.5mg-1mg-.5mg then jumped.

I'm always terrified of Benzo withdrawal because when I was 18 or 19 (26 now) I was doing 20-40mg of etizolam/alprazolam for 6-8 months and had to cold turkey. Took about a month to get through the physical portion.  That period of benzo was also my only other seizure when I went to an Alesso concert and took way less etizolam than normal to not kill my MDMA/MDA roll.  Was odd I didn't seize at the show, but when I got to a chill after party at friends house and took some etizolam because I knew I had to.  I didn't believe them when I woke up on the floor until I saw my girlfriend at the time crying her eyes out.  

Anyways day 2, feel anxious but to be expected.  I'd say 2/10 withdrawal scale, I've kicked benzos and heroin too many times to count.

The goal is after a few weeks start lowering my heroin habit to get down to just methadone for awhile (I got off the needle when I got on methadone but still snort) and hold there for a bit, it's all I haven't given a shot at.  Done detoxes, rehabs, long halfway house stays, AA/NA, sponsorship.

Sorry I know my post is all over the place.  Trying to ride this out and occupy myself.  Any advice, encouragement, stories, criticism is welcome I feel hopeless I'll ever be fully clean before I overdose one of these times.",2

My question is was I taking too many and will I have any withdrawal symptoms? I’ve only taken it once before, literally one pill last year for a similar situation.

Just starting my taper journey and I have to wait a month until I meet with a new psychiatrist who is actually informed on benzo tapering to work out an actual taper schedule of cutting 10% each time. I’m at 1mg of Xanax a day now. It’s been a week since my last cut of .125mg. 

I’ve been feeling overwhelming depression, intrusive and sometimes suicidal thoughts, extreme fatigue and brain fog, and occasional minor paranoia and mini panic attack. Other than that I feel stabilized. I can sleep easily and mostly function around the house and while out and about with my mind occupied. The depression waves are just scary to me and I’ve never experienced this before and when it happens I’m afraid that it’s permanent and that my life is over now. Ive always dealt with panic, mania, and anxiety but this is the first I’ve felt overwhelming depression episodes. I just want to hear that it gets better. I’ve never been physically dependent on this high of a Xanax dose and I don’t know what to expect at all and that part terrifies me too. I have no idea if it’s gunna get worse or better and wondering about that makes me feel hopeless. I just keep worrying about the situation I’m in and telling myself my life is over and this is how it will be forever. I wanna know when will it start to feel like it’s getting better? I know it’s hard to answer because everyone’s different but if anyone has any guesses and predictions they wanna throw my way, I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you all.

2021-07-14 19:05:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/okg0h8/i_fucked_up/,I Fucked up.,"(18M) 

I am on a valium taper .. But I have to say I cant remember what being ""sober"" is like, it's been almost 1 year now that I've been always on mostly benzos or opioids and always a bit a weed a bit of vyvanse in there too, always just drugseeking doing pill runs at parties with some friends. But I'm the one that FUCKED up.

I have been either benzos or opioids (mostly benzos) and a bit of alcohol sometimes mixed) or through their withdrawals for the better part of a year now. I Started 3 years ago but slowly it crept up on me as I enjoyed xanax and valium and last July ever since I stocked up old ""stolen"" Pharma Valium Xanax and Klonopin, that's when it stopped becoming occasional.

Then I would order bromazolam, norflurazepam, phenazepam, ap238 and 237 and even phenobarbital as I ran out from my pharma stock.

It's not even that I ""Hate being sober"" but I can't. I can't remember feeling good sober for almost a year now, looking at my own snap memories it says the same, I miss it. Being sober and feeling ""fine"" -ish. I usted to work at McDonald's and take the equivalent of around 10-20mg of oxy just to get through work. Making excuses for using it literally every day I worked. 

I've always really had anxiety and was born with a lot of phobias and a bad vagus nerve that makes me pass out often and probably comes down to my ""mental illness""  but my anxiety mostly got bad around puberty, mostly social anxiety. It really increased this GAD, social anxiety, insomnia and Panic disorder, Im diagnosed and prescribed Gabapentin Quetiapine and Mirtazapine for that.

**BUT** I relapsed today, yesterday and some other days with some Ketazolam. I make the excuse that I needed a higher dose than my Valium taper, I even used Lorazepam a few times ever since i admitted to my self medicating ..improperly . with benzos, to my family (In Spain living with grandma, mom, dad, uncle and sister) and I now have a psychiatrist specialized in addiction treatment ""helping"" me.

I have had like 10 or more benzo withdrawals and 2 opioid withdrawals in the last 12 months, I would say it was just my insomnia making me crazy, as I went dead through life, withdrawaling and **kindling.**

 I bought a car too, and I've hit it 3 times now, first a fat rocky curb, then I hit a curb on a left turn that fucked my right axle, then the third time it was totaled as I hit a fire extinguisher. I was on benzos and or opioids every single time I crashed and 2 of those times on my phone ish.

I miss being sober. My Normal. I want to quit all my prescriptions and maybe use something as needed for anxiety. My taper is still going to take a while, im still at 20mg of valium (on only half the fucking days as I relapse like a dumbass) 

Tomorrow im meeting with that psychiatrist for my taper, and I'm going to tell him about a study about using Baclofen (Gaba-B agonist) to get rid of benzo withdrawals succesfully and left patients without any w/d symptoms like psychosis or that extreme anxiety..

How bad did I fuck up ... someone give me advice ... I'm going to relapse and buy Valium tomorrow, but i swear it's the last time..
 
**I need addiction help ... benzos fried those GABA-A receptors I had and they give too much relief of anxiety symptoms..**",2

Not so long ago my doc decided to start tapering it (I was worried about having been taking it for that long) and now I'm at 0.5mg. The problem is that my social anxiety got so bad that I can't go out anymore without sweating, having my heart rate reach the 150s etc. It might be because of the taper, but it's been over a month since I lowered the dose so if it was a withdrawal symptom it should've been gone by now. So now I'm stuck at the 0.5mg, as my doc said it's not a good idea to taper further right now. He prescribed me 10mg clobazam and 10mg propranolol for when I need to go out and be in crowds or interact with strangers. The dose will probably change as I don't feel much better when outside, so that sucks.

So tl;dr I was supposed to stop taking alprazolam but now I'm taking two benzos at the same time. I hate the fact that I'll probably end up physically dependent on another benzo but I just hope it helps with my social anxiety because I'm kinda desperate to be able to live a regular life and not freak out near a crowd.",2

My doctors appointment is tomorrow, so I’m looking for as much advice and recommendations as I can get.  

“Tomorrow I have a wellness appointment with my primary doctor.  Presumably she will bring up my alprazolam taper which she mentioned on 5/19 during my telemedicine appointment.  I have zero faith with her knowledge of benzo tapering, hence zero faith she will do what's best for me.  I'm hoping she's amenable to whatever I suggest for a taper.  However, I don't know what to suggest to her.  🤔

Here's where I am now:  I take .25 at night and .25 at some point during the day.  I used to take .50 at night with usually another .25 the next morning or afternoon.  I was drinking in the evening and taking .50 at night when I went to bed.  I quit drinking on 5/31, but have resumed with a couple of light beers yesterday and today.  

About 17-20 days after quitting alcohol and 6 -10 days after eliminating the extra .25 dose and splitting my nighttime .50 dose into .25 night, .25 day, I started experiencing INTENSE itching and skin burning.  I was down to .50 daily and not the usual .75.  I have bruises and scabs from scratching.  

I don't think this is alcohol withdrawal, though it could be related to GABA somehow.  I could be in tolerance withdrawal as well..  However, I was happily living with my .50 or .75 dosage until I learned I would have to give them up.  That's when my anxiety began.  I'm agonizing on which method to choose, in addition to my fear of living with this anxiety for the rest of my life.  I'm 72 years old and don't have the strength or motivation or enthusiasm to undertake this.  However, given the fact that they won't be renewed, I will have to try.  

I feel as if my body could erupt into severe itching at any moment.  I will wake from a sound sleep to intense itching. I had a few drinks yesterday and again today, thinking that would help with the itching.  

Anyway, tomorrow is D-Day and I will have to present a plan or an idea to my doctor.  I can’t wrap my head around any of these tapering methods.  I was interested in the diazepam taper because I felt it would make me the least miserable.  However, I have 142 (.5) alprazolam pills left.  I was even thinking of upping my dose to get rid of my misery.  

One thing I forgot to add is that I have restless leg syndrome, so the alprazolam was initially intended to help with that.  I’ve since been diagnosed and am on pramipexole to help.  

I know this is very disjointed with symptoms and all.  I don't know what’s wrong with me.  I feel my doctor should help with this, since she’s the medical person, but I know she won’t.  Any help or suggestions for  a taper or a presentation at my doctor’s appointment tomorrow would be appreciated.   

1989- Prescribed .5mg alprazolam x 2 for anxiety.  Could not tolerate antidepressants. 
5/19/21:  Primary Dr recommends I start tapering alprazolam
05/31/21:  Quit drinking

So strap in, or ya know, don’t, your choice.*

My last cut down on Valium was about a week ago: 4.5 mg down to 4mg. I started from 2mg of xanex in September 2020. 

I’ve been on various kinds and dosages of prescribed benzos since I was 15 and I’m 34 now so…Jesus fuck what have I done to my brain. 

At this point in my prescribed Valium taper I can’t seem to cut more than .5mg at a time every ~3 weeks or I feel so overwhelmed and physically sick I end up backtracking…I thought once I got to this point things would be easier? They’re not.

Today I woke up and my mind felt like jello and my body felt like wet sandbags.

I kicked a raging heroin and fentanyl addiction two years ago to feel like this. But that’s another story for another time.

When I do get sleep, it seems to take extra time to wake up properly and today is especially bad. I sat in a complete near catatonic haze for about an hour on my couch until saying fuckit and made myself a cup of *caffeinated* coffee. Fucking gamble of the day. My life is really exciting these days…

I have only been drinking decaf since tapering because I’ve learned the hard way, on most days even small amounts of caffeine will heighten my anxiety to where it’s clutching at my throat and my skin feels like it’s starting to vibrate and my guts ache in a concerning way… but at this point this morning I’d almost rather feel alert and anxious over deeply braindead foggy and depressed. So I roll the dice on a small amount of caffeine. 

Oh and the part about my life being exciting, that was absolute bitter sarcasm by the way, my life is NOT exciting. I spend most of my time essentially stumbling around in the dark foggy panic addled recesses of my mind trying to put one foot in front of another (usually to reach my fucking couch or get back to my bed to pretend I can sleep) in the hopes that one day I won’t feel like this, like I’m recovering from what I can only assume a traumatic brain injury feels like.

I kicked a raging heroin and fentanyl addiction two years ago to feel like this?

Although I’ve had pretty severe addiction issues with other substances (opiates and cocaine, weed, throw in the odd alcohol binge here or there) I’ve never abused benzos, they aren’t my DOC by any means, and if anything, I don’t really enjoy the way they feel except that they remove anxiety and quell panic attacks (at the price of feeling like a zombie). 

I was originally prescribed them for PTSD induced panic attacks after a traumatic event. But I never really worked through the trauma… so here I am, still on benzos almost 20 years later. 

Shit, I never even had a doctor try to work through the trauma with me or even suggest resources for it. It seems like, unless you’ve been in active combat, *you* have to tell *them* you’re experiencing severe PTSD symptoms and need help to address it specifically. Otherwise, feel this? We’ve got a script for this. Feel that? We’ve got a script for that too. 

And mind you this is an impossibility, to tell someone you have ptsd while in the acute phases of ptsd. 

I mean what the fuck, most of the time in the beginning of PTSD it feels like the flat-earthers were apparently right, and the world has seemingly flipped upside-down and you’re falling off. You can’t trust your mind or your perception of reality because when it’s not still stuck in that moment it’s probably telling you suicide is a viable option. You’re just trying to make sure you can hang on to the earth while large swaths of your reality vacillate between feelings of being paralyzed and intense anger and despair. Thoughts of “What could I have done differently. How did I let This happen..” 

And for me, and many others I assume, through all the insanity at the beginning of ptsd my initial response was **Just Keep Going**… just keep going and pretend nothing happened. Maybe it will go away…it’s fine. You’re fine. It’s fine? 
Yeah, it’s okay. 
It wasn’t that bad. Right? 
See? Your body is ok. 
You’re alive. I think? 
Yea, I have my limbs and my heart is still beating so it’s fine. 
It’s Okay.
Hey. Whatever you do, just do not stay here, let’s get as far away from this moment as possible so…
Do Not Stop. 
Don’t you fucking dare stop…if you stop then you’ll feel it and we don’t want that. It wasn’t anything anyway.
Ok? Okay. 
Yeah, see? 
You’re alright, it’s fine, you’re fine, right? 
Tell yourself it’s okay. 
It’s Ok.
It’s Ok.
It’s Ok?
Fuck. What’s happening to me?

With nearly all medical professionals I’ve dealt with *You* have to tell *them* that all the medication in the world isn’t solving anything except the immediate threat of suicide because this trauma didn’t shatter your body it shattered your soul and your mind is a worthless engine when your soul is fucking fractured.

I’m getting worked up. I could rage about my experience with psychiatric help forever. So I’ll just put this topic down for now.

I kicked a raging heroin and fentanyl addiction two years ago to feel like this. Yea, so proud of myself right now…

After getting laid off due to Covid in September I figured it was as good a time as any and started my taper from 2mg Xanax.

I haven’t been able to work at all throughout my taper and feel like a complete failure of a person.

I went from working 50+ hours a week at competitive tech company to hardly being able to function due to benzo withdrawal. I can’t control my emotions well now, the depression is out of this world like nothing I’ve experienced before, suicide ideation, agoraphobia, intense feelings of despair, how did I let myself get here and why. I feel like I’m going insane sometimes because of difficulty keeping thoughts organized or having a rush of horrible intrusive thoughts seemingly out of nowhere, I’m exhausted all the time but then also have trouble sleeping more than a couple hours straight.

I understand when I list out my symptoms that what I’m experiencing is textbook benzo withdrawal but it has impacted me physically and mentally so much more than I ever could’ve anticipated and as I stand right now I am an absolute shadow of the person I was before.

My self esteem is crushed. Will I ever be the person I was before? Most days I’m drowning in it.

My family doesn’t understand this at all even though I’ve urged them to research benzo withdrawal- they didn’t care about my withdrawal from opiates or cocaine because only an idiot self medicates with those substances. I deserved that. But this extended withdrawal perplexes them. “You’re still dealing with this? A doctor prescribed it to you, a doctor wouldn’t prescribe something that would do this to

They mostly think I’m being dramatic, which makes me feel worse about what I’m experiencing and doubt everything more. They don’t understand why I don’t want to just go back to work. I can’t...if it was maybe a job I was already very familiar with that would be one thing, but there’s no way I could start with a new company and put in that extra new employee effort with my mind operating at what feels like 1/8th it’s capacity.

My mind is operating at what feels like 1/8th capacity. I kicked a raging heroin and fentanyl addiction two years ago to feel like this. 

After all my recovery work, and let
me tell you I have climbed painstakingly one day at a time out of the depths of hell to get here, after quitting years of heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, weed and alcohol addiction, I had a fucking prescribed dragon waiting for me at the finish line. 

What I thought was my recovery finish line has become a new recovery marathon to start…and I’m still 4mg of Valium away from starting.

2021-07-14 14:51:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/okaxnt/tapering_librium/,Tapering Librium,"I'm sorry this will probably be long, but I'd love some feedback.

As some may skim over this, The Main point is. 1)Librium or Valium,  which is better for tappering?  
2) at this point where I'm in constant WD and holding doesnt help does continueing a long slow taper even make sense? 
3) does switching back to Valium to finish the taper have any possible benefit over Librium? And what are the true equivalent doses? 

Here's the entire story , with symptoms and where I'm at now.

So , about 10 years ago I had a very successful taper from ativan after long term high dose use .  It was all doctor prescribed and I was told it was just a medication that would ease my Lyme disease while I was being treated for that disease..

I've never had a problem with drugs or alchohol other than recreational use in my late teens. 

I really didn't think much about it... taking a prescribed medicine that is. I'm pretty healthy so I don't take meds or see a doctor very often.  

Since my first taper was done so successfully I  had no reason to research the medication or really understand how dangerous it can be. I had never even heard of kindling. So In late 2017 I started taking .5 mg Klonopin after my father passed away, again doctor prescribed and totaly legit.

I'm going to say for the record  I take full responsibility for getting myself into the situation I'm in now, and I should have  been smart enough to have done research before just blindly taking a medication that affects the brain. But, I like many have just been told to Trust Doctors as they take an oath to do no harm.  

After just 7 days on the klonopin really bad stuff started to happen.  This was 3 years ago... since then I've been moved to Ativan that I had a bad reaction to, then to Valium,  and now finaly Librium.  I hit tollerance in like the first week on Klonopin. 

Last year I was up to 30 MG of Valium a day and each week feeling less well, that's when I decided to start doing some research and I realized what the problem probably was... so I told my NEW doctor what I suspected and he agreed,  he put me on a librium taper and told me to go at my own pace. 

I started at 100mg of Librium daily -that was about a year ago.  I'm now down to 50mg.  I have been using a liquid taper and removing a tiny 1mg per week dose.  So in theory I'll be off the medication completely before this time next year. 

I've tried holding when things get rough,  but holding actually seems to make it worse. This last 12 months I've pretty much been sick.

I get like 1 day a week where I feel decent. At least one night a week i can sleep like 7 hours,  but the other nights vary between 3 and 5 hours.

SYMPTOMS
I have almost no short term memory,I can't focus,  
I wake up every morning with my heart pounding and if I try to go back to sleep its massive panic attacks, so I've learned to just get up.
Light  and audio sensitive ,Feeling of burning joints, Muscle cramping, Headaches, no real hallucinations,  but some strange half awake half asleep thoughts and visuals while waking up.  No matter how tired I am, I have found staying in bed actually makes it worse.

Yeah it's a real fun time...all I want to do is rest, but I can't, so practicing acceptance and trying to not focus in on symptoms does help.

Anyone else have any experience with this? I'm trying to figure out if tapering another 11 months is worth it or if I should take a more aggressive approach,  i mean i clearly have no way to avoid some degree of suffering regardless, and I've gotten comfortable being uncomfortable.

I was also given Gabapentin,  and Trileptal  which really helped, thankfully actually researched both those drugs and stopped them almost immediately seeing as how bad the withdrawals from  them can be it didnt make sense to me to get dependent on even more meds and confuse my brain even further.

I've tried THC, CBD, Glycine,  Vitamin K, Taurine, L Theanine, niacin, inositol,  magnesium... nothing really helps, some stuff seems to make it worse.

I've tried to find the equivalent dose of valium for 50mg of librium just to get a gauge of where I'm at. But I've read that Librium to Valium ratio is 5L : 1V.  While some places say 2.5L : 1V is the ratio.  So I'm either on the equivalent dose of 10mg Valium  or 20mg , which is a really big difference.  Most of the online calculators have such a huge margin they are almost worthless . I've had results that say 50L = 12 to 40V... wow really helpful. 

I'm eating healthy and organic, trying to keep busy , forcing myself to exercise. Staying away from other drugs and alchohol completely . I mean I'm doing everything right from my perspective , yet 3 + years of feeling like this sucks...

I've had so many medical tests done, I've ruled everything else out, even my.doctor agrees it's likely  from the benzo use and the previous withdrawal,  so I guess I'm lucky in the sense that I've got a decent doctor now.  

Also does anyone think it might be better to go back to valium to finish the taper or just stick with the librium?

Dont really know what I am trying to get out of this book of a post.. maybe some insights,  answers, and tips, mainly I guess I'd love to hear some success stories from people who have recovered from multiple long term benzo use.  I've got about 9 years between the end of my Ativan taper and the start of my Klonopin use in 2017... I cant believe kindling could be a factor with almost a decade of being clean, but I guess it can??  Also, I'm 45 years old now. Which isnt really old,  but its certainly not young.  Dont know if that matters or not.",6

I’ve recently managed to really slowly taper down to 1.5mg/day over the last 6 months

I really want to stop all together but if I go a day without it I won’t be able to sleep, can’t even string together a sentence, and my anxiety goes off the charts. Even a small reduction leaves me with severe anxiety.

Also it reminds me of who I am. It's comforting to know that I can be ""normal"" again. But I may be manipulating myself because I stay awake for my soul but at the expense of my body if that makes sense. (?) 

Now I've messed with my sleep schedule and only slept for like 2 hours. My best guess is to sleep when I want to and not try to force myself because that's miserable. I've spent so much time in bed trying to convince myself that I'm going to sleep but I just wasted time laying awake.

I'm also prescribed 2mg Clonazepam per day, but I rarely use it. A couple of days ago I ran out of etizolam since my source has stopped responding. I've been using 8-16mg of clonazepam a day (equivalent to 16-32mg of etizolam) to mitigate my withdrawal symptoms, but it's still very painful. I've gone to a professional detox facility in the past back when my etizolam habit was only around 16-20mg a day, and all they did was drop me down to 20mg of Valium daily, then quickly taper me down to nothing over the course of a week. It was hell, so I checked myself out against medical advice, and went straight home and started using etizolam even heavier than before, leading me to here. The withdrawals are getting worse by the day now, and I'm worried sick that I might seize, go into psychosis, or even die. What the hell do I do? I know a hospital will probably just send me home with a small script of valium, and the detox facility is useless.

If you're unfamiliar with me, my general practitioner prescribed me Klonopin 11 years ago for anxiety. I only took them as needed. She told me I needed to take them every day or I could have complications. I believe now - what happened here was a huge mistake. I think she was referencing taking them everyday after I was taking them, regularly. I wasn't dependent on them... until I followed her advice. --- but, I genuinely believe she didn't mean harm.

A little over 3 years ago, I saw some articles in medical journals that said Klonopin had been linked to some other ailments. I tried to taper the way I had off prednisone, over and over, as a child. I ended up in an Emergency room - and that's when I found out what you -- all -- know now. Klonopin doesn't like to be evicted and it has great lawyers. (My sense of humor has survived)

Thank you Thank everyone Thank the particles in the inter webs for this place because the Ashton Manual and the people here who confirmed this is more difficult than it should've been allowed to be.

At 7 years on Klonopin, I was told I should - just stay on it forever.

Ugh - no.

But - that feeling of knowing I was a prisoner in my body and there was no white-knuckling on earth that could be done. There was math, spreadsheets, and time.

I have other health issues and I got sick last year. I had to stop the taper several times. I also paused it  when I lost family members because benzo withdrawal is not good on the psyche.

From a peak of 3 mg, but mostly 2mg -

I slowly moved over to diazepam... so slowly..

Then, oh boy, 2020 - so, now I can say ""hey! I quit my anxiety medication in 2020!"" - that's a line that will never get old.

My doctor just moved on to a new practice, but I'm staying with the organization I'm with because I do groups, etc there. On my last appointment with him --- I was excitedly waiting to tell him on video call - ""oh, I don't need a refill""

He sat there so still I thought the video froze LOL

This was a psychiatrist I was not screaming - at - just in the room with - when I showed him the Ashton Manual and said ""there are all these people online and no one can help them!""

So, he moved on to his next job as someone who has seen a 3 year benzo taper through -- and knows - firsthand - it takes 3 years. He's told me to go back up a little when I haven't wanted to ... a medical doctor I've seen in video asked for my story and the Ashton manual explained. I'm telling any doctor who will listen... -- and anyone else -

Now, it's payback time :) NO, seriously - in 2019, I called the FDA and they told me they have a 9 week maximum for prescriptions on benzodiazepines they ""don't enforce"" - knowing they cause permanent damage. They also told me they have ""guidelines"" about GPs prescribing.

In 2020, they ""updated"" their warning to include this, they changed - nothing:

**09-23-2020  FDA Drug Safety Communication**

Benzodiazepines can be an important treatment option for treating disorders for which these drugs are indicated. However, even when taken at recommended dosages, their use can lead to misuse, abuse, and addiction. Abuse and misuse can result in overdose or death, especially when benzodiazepines are combined with other medicines, such as opioid pain relievers, alcohol, or illicit drugs. **Physical dependence can occur when benzodiazepines are taken steadily for several days to weeks, even as prescribed. Stopping them abruptly or reducing the dosage too quickly can result in withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening.**

(Note how they still put abuse and misuse first when I think physical dependence no matter how you take them should be at the top of the list)

So - I am thrilled. I'm vibrating, shaking, my stomach is a mess. I'll be eating non-dairy yogurt and almond milk rice pudding for 2 years, that's clear. My fogginess is much better, mood is wayyy better. I feel clearer, more alive. My longest friends asked me what the big change in my voice was! I have to sit in the dark a bit, headaches, my hands shake. I'll feel like I gargled rat poison in my eyeballs for 7 years for awhile, I can tell. But, every day I see that -- almost empty diazepam bottle sitting there.. it's worth it. There are a few in case my other medicine changes - and I should take 0.5mg or something. I have zero desire to take them. 

Who needs food, sanity, steady hands? I don't take Klonopin, anymore! I don't take Klonopin, anymore! Klonopin be gone! I don't take benzos anymore!

This is the hardest thing I've ever done. After I started, I was just comically driven to keep going. I had to fight the urge to go faster. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED!

You can do it! I feel so much better mentally and just knowing I crushed those stupid pills will my sheer iron will and 3 years of wailing like a movie with Eye of the Tiger playing in the background. (this is exactly what happened. Exactly. There was a montage.)

1/2 0.5 = 0.25

0.125 + 1/2 0.125 = 0.1875

0.125

1/2 0.125 = 0.0625 

I jotted down a dry cut slow taper that would take about 6 months to complete, too, but I’m not thrilled about ingesting this med for that long and dragging this process out that far. Still, I know a lot of people fare better with slow tapers. 

.375 (.25 + .125) - 2 weeks - 42 x .125

0.34375 (0.25 + .09375 (3/4 tablet) - 2 weeks

0.3125 (0.25 + 0.0625 (1/2 tablet)) - 2 weeks

0.28125 (0.25 + .03125 (1/4 tablet)) - 2 weeks

0.25 - 2 weeks

.21875 (.125 + 0.0625 (1/2 tablet) + 0.03125 (1/4 tablet)) = 2 weeks

.1875 (.125 + 0.0625 (1/2 tablet)) = 2 weeks

.15625  (.125 + 0.03125 (1/4 tablet)) = 2 weeks

.125 - 2 weeks

0.09375 (0.0625 (1/2 tablet) + 0.03125 (1/4 tablet)) = 2 weeks

0.0625 (1/2 tablet) - 2 weeks

0.03125 (1/4 tablet) - 2 weeks

Done

Back in May I walked into the ER around midnight and said I was dealing with excruciating pain and I was suicidal. I was waiting to get a room in the psych ward and it took a few days so I had enough time to convince a doctor in the ER to give me nerve blocks in my back. 

To be fair I didn't ask what the pills were for until after I had swallowed them. Seems like I got ""fortunate"", being in an annex with drug seekers and people detoxing that the doctor had given me norco and valium in preparation for 4 lidocaine shots directly into my damaged nerves which still hurt like a bitch. 
I appreciated the sympathy the doc and nurses showed me  in such a crumby situation but I wish I hadn't had any benzos, I was doing so good. Today, for some reason I cannot stop thinking about popping these Xanax I found. It's quite a struggle, and for some reason I can't flush them like I know I should. 

Having chronic pain and mental health problems, and healing from substance use disorder this is quite a conundrum. I'm just taking things one day at a time now and my life has improved since leaving the hospital but I'm having a rough day today. Why does it have to hurt so much? I've been benzo free for 6 weeks now and I'm not in withdrawal or anything I just started having cravings, first for cigarettes even though I quit years ago, then for weed which I got a handle on, but now I'm dealing with benzo cravings and I know what triggered them but I don't know why it took this long. 

It's weird how the human brain works sometimes. I need some good vibes sent my way, I'm hoping I can find the strength to flush these pills but I'm struggling enough as it is and I don't know if I have enough strength what a strange place I'm in now.",3

The whole point of a taper is that you keep on functioning as well as possible. There is no gain in reducing the dose drastically and then feeling like a lunatic for the following days. 

I was tired of explaining myself to that physician. Other physicians recommended me to taper 40 mg Valium in 5 days. A drug hotline told me to quit cold turkey. 

Trust your gut - if you don't feel ready to reduce the dose yet, don't do it. I wasn't comfortable to reduce the dose by 2 mg. Now I'm sitting here kind of lost trying to just clean the house to stay active. 

I should have just listened to myself. Going slow is strong. Rushing the process isn't conducive to healing.

2021-07-12 12:30:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/oiut7b/an_open_letter_to_benzo_alcoholics/,An Open Letter to Benzo Alcoholics,"were you put on a daily benzodiazepine regimen for anxiety and/or insomnia? after a year or more of routinely raising your dose in accordance with the reappearance of severe anxiety or insomnia, do you feel feel like your negative feelings now are more intense than you ever felt them before treatment with benzos? have you resorted to overindulgence of alcohol to relieve these symptoms? is alcohol the only thing that makes you feel anything close to “normal” nowadays? well, this is the post for you. 

Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that exert their effects in a way that are all thought to be similar. They effect the two most important main chemicals in your entire nervous system- GABA and Glutamate. This essential duo comprise the framework in which every sensory aspect of your body acts on- movement, sensory input, memory, etc. Think of these neurochemicals as the ‘structure’ of a house. It can’t stand without both of them working in tandem to support the rest of it. Without them, the house would collapse. 

GABA by nature is ‘inhibitory’. This means that it signals the nervous system to ‘slow down’ or ‘limit sensory input’. Think of GABA as, for example, what keeps your hand steady when you’re excitedly writing a letter to your best friend. GABA is present in every functional movement and impulse. If you’re withdrawing currently or have done in the past, you may have noticed that one of your symptoms include spasticity, or shakiness of the muscles. This is due to GABA’s down-regulation in your system, while I’ll elaborate on later in this port.  Similarly, this symptom is often present during alcohol withdrawals, which will also come in later.

Now, Glutamate is the regulatory counterpart to GABA. It is ‘excitatory’. It makes you spring into action- think of your fight or flight response. It’s what triggers the body into prompt action, and is almost always anxiety inducing in some way. Think of Glutmate as an opposite, or balance to GABA. 

Both of these neurotransmitters need each other to achieve optimal balance and function, and when just one of them is out of whack, everything in the system comes crashing down. These NT’s are what control every other secondary neurotransmitter in the body- serotonin, dopamine, etc. Imbalances in the ‘big two’ trigger a massive chain reaction of dysfunction when out of balance. In short, depend on each other for ideal functioning. What a benzo does, in essence, is is artificially increase the actions of GABA. This is exactly why benzos induce a calming effect. When on benzos long term, your body is now relying on the calming effects of the GABA boost, and in turn your receptors have no choice but to adapt to these chemical changes. Why? As I mentioned before, the body relies on certain vital checks and balances to maintain homeostasis (think of homeostasis as a state of ‘normal’ functioning). When GABA is is artificially up-regulated on benzos, it also needs to up-regulate Glutamate so you’re able to function without being a human slug. Your body is now doing a ‘speedball’  to cancel out the depressant effects of GABA with the excitatory effects of Glutamate. But it really can never be true balance- your body still knows that this state is unnatural after a certain point, and this is where the concept of tolerance comes in. 

Tolerance occurs when the body is confused about how much Glutamate it needs to cancel out the excess of GABA. Often times the increase of anxiety that comes with a tolerance is met with an increase in your benzo dosage, but we all know that it can’t be raised indefinitely. When you get too used to the depressant effects, glutamate unregulated to an often unbearable point in which you feel worse than you ever did before chemical alteration. Similarly, when you start taking less benzos either gradually or all at once, the body is temporarily confused and needs time to get used to balancing GABA and Glutamate to create necessary balance. Cessation of benzos mean that your body temporarily doesn’t have nearly enough GABA and way too much Glutamate. These effects carry into the other aforementioned secondary neurotransmitters and are why benzo withdrawals tend to manifest in a vast array of negative symptoms. 

As simply as I can put it, there are GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. Benzos typically affect  GABA-A, while things like alcohol, baclofen, and gabapentin act on GABA-B. This is why baclofen and gabapentin are common drugs prescribed to ease withdrawals- they act as a suitable (though not perfect) fit to make the receptors pretend to function normally again. Most of us innocently taking benzos have no clue about GABA-B drugs, which is exactly how we discover (often accidentally) that alcohol also fills that niche. When the overabundance of Glutamate is causing symptoms like insomnia and anxiety, we seek out alcohol for its depressant effects which mimics GABA-A balance. 

Those of us in tolerance withdrawal may find ourselves overindulging in alcohol when we previously had no issues having a healthy relationship with drinking in the past. Just like benzos, we have to keep upping the alcohol dose to feel any sense of normalcy. Many of us develop severe alcohol addictions seemingly overnight to cope with the withdrawal cycle, the existence of which we were never even warned about. I’m writing this post because the same thing happened to me- a 20 year old with anxiety issues and no previous history of of binge drinking in the slightest. We find ourselves turning to yet another substance that merely mimics normalcy- yet the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again so that we’re faced with several cases of the only group of withdrawals that are directly lethal. 

This IS more common than you’d think, and there’s no need to be ashamed. If i had a dollar for every time I beat myself up for letting myself become a “delinquent alcoholic junkie” who couldn’t handle my own emotions, who couldn’t function in the real world, who couldn’t be happy without substances, I’d be able to pay my way into space someday. I don’t care if you’re shooting H through your toenails right now- the substance is the degenerate—- not you. Take responsibility for your actions, but the fact that your brain was chemically altered in a way even scientists can’t exactly pin down now isn’t your fault. It’s common knowledge on this sub that benzos are more than any of us signed up for, but it will never be too late to get better. You may be drinking a fifth of vodka a day and binging 25 mg of your benzo but you will always be able to recover and eventually lead a normal life again. Recognizing the mechanism of action of these drugs helped me a lot in recovery, and for me it was also the first part of realizing that I could release them shame that came with it. 

You won’t ever be alone here- in a world of 6+billion people you will always find somebody who has gone though something similar. Fuck benzo withdrawals, fuck alcohol withdrawals, but also make them your bitch. I don’t want a chemical imbalance to ruin your life, so if you’ve found yourself at rock bottom like I have, don’t be afraid to ask for help. I love you all!

I’ve done my best to try and explain all of this in layman’s terms with the help of several sources which I’ll be happy to link below if anybody is curious. Benzo withdrawal is mind-numbingly complex and pretty much impossible to nail down in a single Reddit post. I’m kind of a dumb-dumb if you haven’t already noticed, so please feel free to correct me in the comments. No really, please do because this is so far out of my depth lol. As always I’m happy to answer any questions or elaborate on my personal experiences, so don’t be afraid to comment or pm me :) Best of luck to my benzo-beating badasses ;)",24

My Doctor prescribed me Buspirone and Ativan in the beginning of April for anxiety/panic attacks and general anxiety. The Buspirone was hard to deal with,kinda took away apprehensiveness for a while but wired me out to the point I couldn’t sit still for very long or sleep without my nightly dose of Ativan .5 mg.
I wrote my pill schedule down and took it in to show my Doctor near the end of April . He convinced me to stick with the Buspirone and Ativan another month and I did.There were a few days in April where I took an extra .5 mg but normal was just a .5 about 2 hours before bed every day. That schedule stayed the same until I quit the Buspirone near the end of May.  At that point I had discovered what my Doctor failed to tell me. Just how addictive the Ativan was. 
I cut my halved my dose .25 mg  twice a day for a week or 2 then cut it again to .25 once a day. I tried to reduce in June by skipping days and then tried to jump off but had a terrible day 4 and started taking my daily .25 mg at exactly 6:00 in the evening from June 20th until today July 10.  Called my Doctor for advice. Without even talking to me he fired me out a script for Hydroxyzine 25mg. Told me to take a quarter pill.125 mg of Ativan for just one more week with the hydroxyzine and then go to just the hydroxyzine for any withdraws or anxiety.
I haven’t taken any hydroxyzine yet as I am afraid to combine two CNS drugs and I also think one week is too fast a taper and I should try to stabilize on the .125 mg dose before jumping off for good.   
I am looking for input from knowledgeable people including people that will agree with the Doctor and tell me to just man up and jump off.

These websites were created by doctors and patients (and even doctors who became patients) to collect and consolidate tons of information from tapering to informed consent, plus all kinds of other stuff.

If you're like me and only took this crap as prescribed for it to then basically ruin your life, you're probably pissed, lost, scared and experiencing anywhere from 1-500 withdrawal symptoms. Then turn around to find no one believes you and most importantly the prescribing doctor doesn't believe you.

The most important things I can say after 11 years of experience are:

- Make A Plan and adjust it as you go. Try not to add too many variables (other drugs/supplements). If you do, one at a time. Start writing things down. It really helps. Also, with clonzepam, diazepam and other long half-life benzos, you won't start really feeling things for 3-8 days later so it helps to know what you did. 

- Be patient. It took a long time for me to slow the hell down. The time I spent recovering from going too fast was more than if I just would have went slow in the first place.

- Taper slowly but not too slow. Some taper plans may work some my not. I've seen people tapering so slowly though that they were just prolonging the suffering. Push hard but not too hard. 

- Learn to identify withdrawal symptoms. I've seen lots of people get diagnosed for all kinds of things based on withdrawal symptoms. They then take more drugs and dig deeper into the cycle of hell. Becareful of that. 

- Rumination. I singled out this symptom because I don't think it's mentioned enough. When your central nervous system is screaming it is very difficult to stop ruminating. This can be devastating and exhausting. Like I said, make a plan.

- Exercise, diet, hydration. You'll probably see these mentioned over and over which is good because they need repeating. They truly make a difference. 

I'll answer any questions based on 11 years of taking 0.5-3mgs of clonazepam daily, 5 years of which were in some form of tapering on and off and 100s of hours of research and my experience. 

This absolutely sucks. Not going to lie. But don't read every horror story and start making it worse like I did. Calm down as much as possibly and kick its ass. 

Good luck.",88

i'm Pia, 23 years old and my husband has epilepsy. He is on a daily dosis of 60mg Diazepam against seizures.   
He had no time to go to the doctor this week and needs his medicine. There were two times were he didn't made it to the doctor (one time were the doctor was on vacation and on time were he had a really busy week).   
So he went to the 'ärtzlicher Bereitschaftsdienst', which is an kind of emergcy doctor for the weekends in germany for cases were you don't need to go to the hospital. It was no problem to get a prescription there because that's what they are there for and he got told there that it's no problem to get a prescription till he can go to his usual doctor again because that's what they are there for.  
He went there yesterday, but they are no longer allowed to give a prescription for diazepam (and a lot of other different medicines) and the doctor he talked to was really really sorry that he couldn't help my husband, he wasn't even able to give him other anticonvulsants (because of the same law change that doesn't allow him to give him diazepam). He just gave him enough for his dosis yesterday from the emergency stuff, which he could lose his job for.   
He didn't knew how to help my husband, because in germany you don't get help in the EA or the local psychiatry (and you are not able to go to another psychiarty) for benzos.  
Even the doctor didn't knew what my husband should to, he was really friendly to him, but upset about the changes so he can't prescribe really important medicine to his patients anymore. He basically told my husband that he will probably die.  
Today, we tried to get help from the EA and local psychiatry, but they won't help him. We don't know anyone in private who can help us.  
My husband has his next appointment with his doctor Tuesday (doctor is closed on monday) and he seriously needs direct help till then.  
Does anyone know what to do? Is anyone near us (frankfurt) and can help my husband out?

I struggled off and on, sometimes worse and sometimes better, but the weight on my shoulders was always there. The dose was never right, and when it would l get unbearable I would turn to alcohol which put a *huge* strain on my relationships with my family and landed me in the ER several times. 

Then for a while I got really stupid and decided to just say screw it and got hooked on stimulants and some serious benzos. It felt like the only way I could have energy and be happy (even if I was miserable coming down from stimulants half the time).

That came, not surprisingly, to a crashing disaster and I basically have been a mess for the past 2 years. Tried getting help, could never see a psychiatrist (that shit is DIFFICULT), doctors wouldn't prescribe anything but Xanax and klonopin and I supplemented with illicit benzos, and wasn't getting anywhere. All my money was was allocated to not withdrawing. 

Recently my family doctor got transferred to a different facility and I got a new doctor. Younger guy, wasn't sure about him at first, he kept my meds the same. But I decided what the hell, brought him the Ashton manual yesterday and expressed my concerns about the meds I was taking and what they were doing to me, and he was *enamoured* with it. Couldn't stop reading it, asked if he could keep it. He said that as a family doctor, they don't learn hardly anything about benzos and withdrawals etc. and he felt it was his job to learn as much as he could. 

Switched me over to a slightly overly appropriate prescription of valium and I will be doing a proper taper from now on.

I can't believe how well it went, and I can't believe I finally have a bottle of pharmaceutical prescribed Valium next to me. I know it's only been one day and it's a long road but I already feel steady, and calmer knowing that I'm not going to have to manage this on my own, worry about withdrawal and seizures, etc. The way my anxiety manifests, I've long felt that valium would be the ideal drug for me. 
It's like finally things are looking up, when they were looking pretty grimm.

I'm hoping now I'll feel rested and stable enough to get back into an exercise routine and start taking better care of myself, while pursuing therapy and possibly different medications. 

Just wanted to share my experience. There are good doctors out there!",40

Since the past few years I've (mostly) managed to overcome this curse by taking steps to improve my self-esteem and employing positive thinking and various calming/breathing techniques which generally work but in large social gatherings I often find myself breathing irregularly with excessive sweating and racing thoughts/heartbeat. 

In the past I've taken Atenolol to clam myself down in these situations. Atenolol work wonders, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't put a rest to my racing thoughts + I've to start taking it a few days prior, which isn't always feasible, and then have to slowly reduce my dosage on top of that. Plus, Atenolol only seems to alleviate physical symptoms.

I've been hearing a lot about Clonazipam lately. I understand it's highly addictive, on account of being a benzodiazepine, but I just want to take is sparingly i.e once or twice a month (before 'intense' situations) and in very limited amounts (0.5mg). I'm not going to take it regularly as it just sounds too... scary!

We all know it's not linear, making the taper confusing and difficult to manage. But during the pandemic, I managed to go down 4mg.  Feels like a miracle just writing those words.

Now, for 8 months (!), I'm firmly on 2mg. But I'm doing it right. Very gradual taper, no rush, letting my body recover. And here I am, a mess.

Here's what is happening. When I try to go down the smallest amount (aka .10), the benzo flu gets me. I'm exhausted, tired, achy, hostile, easily annoyed and in bed a sleeping machine. .10! That's it.  So I tried to get past *that* by pushing harder, going down .5, and I got the exact same response. My body just isn't having it.

Is this psychological? I can't even believe that I'm throwing it out there but, I read other recoveries, and who takes 8 months? Most would have been clean by now (or, so it seems).

Just so frustrating. I'm getting to the point that no matter what I do take 2mg, feel like total hell. Taper, feel like hell. I'm tempted to go back up just so I can not feel like hell anymore.

I tapered from 1.5 to 1.25 alprazolam on 6/16 and have been holding. I thought I was stabilizing on day 10, but I got hit hard with symptoms on day 11 and since that time have just had ongoing problems.

Most recently my heart rate and blood pressure just keep creeping up. I thought maybe those were stabilizing too, but today was the worst yet. I'm already on a beta blocker and have sent a message to my doctor to see if it can be increased.

At this point, is there any point in continuing to wait before I make a cut? I have to go out of town next Monday through Thursday, so I'd wait until I got back. But I'm getting really disheartened and I don't want to wait forever for things to settle down any more if the likelihood is that at this point, they won't.

Totalling 8.5, this could have been 10.5mg in my blackout state. Stupid, I know. I’ve had high tolerance in the last, but it’s gone right down. I was laying in bed with my partner saying alllll sorts of shit that didn’t make sense and spilt a plate of food later in the night, waking with the TV on.

Edit - I’d also drank a whiskey in the afternoon AND had a clonidine 🤦🏼‍♂️

My question to you all is (this was planned for a relatively light opioid withdrawal) am I safe to take 1mg morning, 1 mg night for the next 2, nights? Then the following 3 days I’m planning on taking 0.5 morning and 0.5 night.

I know it’s a short taper, but it’s also extreme short benzo use, just want to make sure there’s no seizure risk.

Could the 8.5-10.5 last night caused a seizure? And will I be at risk of having anymore with my taper plan? (I have no access to valium).

Really need one.,"I stupidly went up about .5mg clonazepam. I thought I could “stabilize” because I wasn’t sleeping and eating, etc. I hadn’t yet become aware of this info from the Ashton Manual:

Updosing during withdrawal? Some people hit a ""sticky patch"" during the course of benzodiazepine withdrawal. In many cases, staying on the same dose for a longer period (not more than a few weeks) before resuming the withdrawal schedule allows them to overcome this obstacle. However, increasing the dose until a longed-for plateau of 'stability' arrives is not a good strategy. The truth is that one never 'stabilises' on a given dose of benzodiazepine. The dose may be stable but withdrawal symptoms are not. It is better to grit one's teeth and continue the withdrawal. True recovery cannot really start until the drug is out of the system.

Pharmacologically, neither reinstating nor updosing is really rational. If withdrawal symptoms are still present, it means that the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors have not fully recovered (see above). Further benzodiazepines cause further down-regulation, strengthen the dependence, prolong withdrawal, delay recovery and may lead to protracted symptoms. In general, the longer the person remains on benzodiazepines the more difficult it is to withdraw. On the whole, anyone who remained benzodiazepine-free, or has remained on the same dose, for a number of weeks or months would be ill-advised to start again or to increase dosage. It would be better to devote the brain to solving individual symptoms and to finding sources of advice and support. Advice about how to deal with individual symptoms is given in the Manual (Chapter 3).",1

I been taking 0.5mg most of the time and some days when i needed it for anxiety and stressful situations i took 0.75mg and like 4-5 times 1g in about one month. 

Problem i have now is i try taking 0.75mg to stabilise on that dose but every third day like tonight i just can't and have to take 1g. I am now about 1 and a half months on Clonazepam per day.

My withdrawals start at 21 hours after last dose but it's only tremors and little bit of anxiety. 30 mins before the 24 hour mark the anxiety ramps up and feel very sensitive to light and noise. 

I take my first 0.25mg dose at 24 hour mark which is 6pm. Then i take 0.5mg 3 hours later at 9pm cause after 4 hours i get very anxious and feels like withdrawals again not sure why, maybe glutamate surges so if i take it 9pm i fall a sleep at 11pm and don't feel the anxiety and nervousness.

The next morning i feel good like no withdrawals no anxiety till about 21 hour mark and it starts all over again.

Tonight, this is not the first time(about every 3rd day now) i took my first 0.25mg at 6pm and everything was the same as usual but 2 hours after i start feeling anxious but not to much. I then all of a sudden get an anxiety attack and it last for about 3-5 mins after i am able to calm my self i stand up to go to eat and i almost fall over from being dizzy so i start to panic all over so i go and test my blood pressure everything is fine and heart rate is about 85bpm so it's not that.

So i take another 0.25mg and 2 hour later the sensitivity to light and noise give me anxiety and i am so anxious and paranoid  so i say f it an 0.5mg more.

Waiting for it to kick in atm but this is real horrible night and i don't understand why. Only thing i can think of is tolerance has gone up and i need to take 1g a day but i really don't want to. If i talk 1g now then in 2 weeks time it's 1.25mg and before you know it i have a huge dose and huge problem.

What is happening? Should i go to 1gpd? Also, how hard will it be to taper 1gpd?

I am very new to this and finding it hard to cope atm but i just want to stabilise on a dose so will i stabilise at 1g?

Any advice would be helpful but can't go to the dr now so please other than that please help by giving advice.

2021-07-07 13:19:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ofni9d/1_year_benzo_free_update/,1 YEAR BENZO FREE UPDATE 🎉,"Hi! my one year of sobriety came and went what seems like so quickly, but so slowly at the same time. the first 8 months felt like 5 years, but the last 4 months were like a flash in the pan. it was one of the most difficult things i’ve ever done, but it was so worth it. here’s my success story! 

for background: i was 22 when i went cold turkey off 2 mg of klonopin and 10 mg ambien in a detox facility. i went to rehab because i had been spiraling out of control when i hit tolerance and had developed an alcohol addiction nobody in my life EVER saw coming. apparently this sort of thing happens to a lot of people who are on benzos long term. i never even drank before, and i doubt i ever would have started if not for benzos. my psychiatrist wrote me whatever i wanted, so i had a 2 mg script even though i took only 1 mg regularly. the other 30 pills id binge on and finish 3 days after filling it. this combined with the alcohol and ambien meant that a year and a half of my life was essentially one long blackout.

the covid lockdown is when things started to get really out of hand, so i checked into rehab in late june. i had no idea they were going to cut me off the klonopin and ambien; i guess i just assumed they’d continue to give it to me in detox. but nope! i got a 4 day ativan taper for the booze and they acted like quitting benzos cold turkey was like, no big deal lol. i actually had a lot of fun in detox and they gave me a baclofen every few hours which made me feel loads better, especially since my most major symptom was tremors. i was living the good life in detox because of the round the clock nurse station feeding me comfort meds. this changed when i got to treatment, however. up until that point (though i didn’t know it at the time) i hadn’t even had the slightest taste of full blown withdrawal yet. they told me that benzo withdrawal symptoms only lasted 3 weeks, so i decided to discontinue the comfort meds upon entering treatment. bigggg mistake. crying, jitters, anxiety, intense depersonalization, total lack of sleep, you guys know the drill. i couldn’t even close my eyes to rest because the tremors were making my eyelids violently spasm. long story short, after 4 days of feeling like i was literally on crack it finally dawned on me that i was experiencing withdrawal. i was struggling to get through 8 hours daily of meetings and by this point i was so emotionally fucked that i threw a huge fit- huge enough for them to let me leave against dr advice on a saturday (if you’ve been to rehab in america, there’s a weird system of the weekend not counting so they won’t give your belongings back or let you make a phone call until the following monday). and i don’t throw fits. i am a very reserved, VERY polite person by nature. i’m incredibly slow to anger and i’m generally pretty rational/agreeable to compromise. i don’t know else to explain it but it felt like an out of body experience or demonic possession, haha. i begged the supervisor to make a phone call, and when she said no i yelled at her, cursed at her, and flipped the hell out. as soon as i left the room i felt absolutely horrible and returned immediately to apologize. i ended up doing this several more times, and it’s a testament to my mental state at the time because it’s wildly out of character for me. 

i’m glad i went home. i was borderline hallucinating my loved ones dying and not even being able to call them except for once a week supervised for 10 minutes wasn’t helping me recover at all. the lack of understanding of benzo withdrawal even among addiction specialists is absolutely mind boggling. how they think even an ounce of information from a meeting gets comprehended by somebody who had been awake for 5 days straight and on the edge of psychosis from the cold turkey benzo withdrawals is fucking beyond me. my
mom has completed a full program in this state several times and she’s the biggest badass i know for that fact alone. 

anywho, withdrawal was worlds better in my own home with my dog and loved ones. i hit up my new psych for the same comfort meds i had in detox (baclofen, hydroxyzine, doxepin and propranolol) and since she’s one of the good addiction specialists, she was shocked that they made me go cold turkey and happily obliged. i’m not gonna lie, it was tough. i was pretty much useless for 7 months. i couldn’t feel any emotion or even watch tv because it became impossible to suspend my disbelief in any way. i couldn’t engage in conversations with even my best friends and i just hid in my room tensed up all day. i spoke about 10 words a week to my boyfriend. i was incapable of expressing positive emotions to loved ones. for about 6 months i was 110% certain that i didn’t exist, and i obsessively ruminated on whether or not i was actually dead. that was the worst symptom to get though. i didn’t have to do work or school thank god, but looking back i wish i could have distracted myself more. unfortunately covid was still a pretty big issue at the time so i couldn’t do a lot of the sober person activities i wanted to. the windows started getting longer at around 8 months, and after 11 months i entered a window that i still haven’t really left. 

since it wasn’t my mom’s first rodeo, i’m glad i had her to coach me through my symptoms. you have to draw from a strength deep inside yourself to get through this sort of thing. for me, i think i really did make my withdrawal process A LOT better than it could’ve been by sheer force of will. i faked being happy so hard that i convinced myself that i was doing pretty good all things considered. every opportunity i had to get out of the house and leave my comfort zone, i took. even if i was miserable the whole time, i forced my way through it. i had already lost a year and a half to benzos, and i wasn’t about to let them waste a second more of my life. obviously this isn’t just me going “lol have u considered just _not_ having withdrawal symptoms??” but you HAVE to fight this thing on a mental level to some extent. your brain is trying to relearn how to function, and it needs steering in the right direction sometimes. additionally, my cocktail of comfort meds helped IMMENSELY. i always managed to get 8 hours of sleep a night from the doxepin and that was really my saving grace keeping me from total insanity. tremors were my longest persisting symptom. they were really bad until the 10 month mark despite the high doses baclofen AND propranolol. i still have them slightly to this day, but they’re definitely fading. another thing to keep in mind is that you can ‘overthink’ your way into experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms than you otherwise could be. i’d say if you’re less than 6 months out, NO DOOMSCROLLING THE BENZO FORUMS. seeking support from the forums is totally fine, and i know it’s really easy to fall into an anxiety induced rabbit hole browsing other people’s horror stories, but it’s a slippery slope to an already fragile mind frame. i remember constantly panicking about whether or not i was having/going to have x horrible symptom and the worrying alone made me embody the symptom sometimes. 

one more random chunk of wisdom from my mom: “your withdrawals are kind of over when you’ve decided they’re over”. once you’re 10+ months out your symptoms will likely have dulled to a much more manageable point. to this day i could nitpick every instance feeling depressed or jittery or generally unengaged, but most of us were on benzos in the first place because we have anxiety. just because you’re clean and a long way out now doesn’t necessarily mean there won’t be good and bad days just like before! i’m not sure what “normal” feels like anymore, but i barely even think about benzo withdrawals anymore whereas withdrawal consumed my life at one point. you’ve gotta be really nice to yourself and do everything you can to develop healthy coping skills. and guess what? if you get through this, you probably NEVER have to do it again. i’m almost grateful for my withdrawal experience because i had to overcompensate for feeling like shit for so long that now that i’m feeling normal again everything else seems like a friggin vacation comparatively. benzo recovery will be a mere blip in your timeline one day, i PROMISE. a year or 2 seems like such a long time but it really isn’t in the grand scheme of things. the strength you gain from this will carry over into other aspects of you let it :) i was a horrible pessimist and general cynic before all of this happened. now i kind of can’t help but look on the brighter side. 

i’m sorry this post is such a novel. if you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading!! in short, i finally got over the damn hill and it is definitely possible to do so. you will get your life back! feel free to ask any and all questions in the comments :) &lt;3 i’m also not the best writer so please forgive my many grammatical errors lol",74

Ive been using etizolam on a daily 20mg dose for 3 months on and off. (Which was way more than i actually needed, the withdrawal started after 2 days after cold turkey)
I've been tapering down from 20mg to 9mg in one step for 3 weeks, even did a cold turkey for 4 days) 

Now I'm back to 9mg daily but the withdrawals are unbareable, so yesterday i went from 9 mg to 15 mg but noticed no decrease in withdrawal symptoms, even 20 mg etizolam does nothing anymore for my anxiety.

Now here's the weird thing: before i tapered down (3 weeks ago) i felt fine on 10-15mg etizolam a day. How comes that 20mg did nothing for my anxiety yesterday? 
Do i need to take this dose longer than one day to get it back into my system again?

I would really appreciate some help from other users, because no matter what dose I take, i feel shit anyway.

I'm currently at 20mg diazepam of valium daily.

The thing is, I really want to stop touching my GABA-A receptors, because even though valium is supposed to be a long half life drug, every day is a bumpy ride of anxiety, specially 4-5 hours after my dose, which makes no sense for me as it should have accumulated in my system by now.

So I theorized using Baclofen (GABA-B agonist) to get off benzos faster, slowly replacing my Valium doses for baclofen or something and I came upon this research study:
 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896864/

Which basically confirms to me that baclofen can be effective for benzo w/d and I would love to do this so my GABA-A receptors can heal while my untouched GABA-B receptors mask my symptoms. 

But how can I mention this to my doctor in a way that doesn't sound like I am drug seeking ? Should I mention the study or talk about it like I'm a drug nerd? Because last time I saw this doctor I was extremely anxious and could barely get my point across, I even acted like I didn't know what diazepam was when I was prescribed because of how anxious I was from my withdrawal symptoms.

June 2018 - started feeling weird symptoms in my body like tension in neck muscles and tight jaw and burning sensation. Doctor prescribed Gabapentin for two weeks and it went away.

But again it appeared after a month and my story with psychotropic drugs started.

I went to a neurologist who asked for MRI scans as by this time I also started feeling dizzy. Nothing came out in MRI scan and doctor diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia and started treating me with Amitriptyline and Gabapentin. It gave me some relief but not so much. I was on it for 3 months and then finally switched to escitalopram or Lexapro 5 mg plus clonazepam 0.5 mg. This gave me the most relief and the doctor changed the diagnosis to depression/anxiety although I am not depressed at all. It is just the physical symptoms which drove me crazy.

Anyway I felt normal after taking Lexapro and clonazepam for four months and wanted to discontinue. I was able to come cold turkey as per doctor's advice. I just had Lexapro for another month and left clonazepam cold turkey. I didn't feel anything. But the only symptom which I always had was dizziness which makes me very anxious and interferes with my daily life. I quit everything in January 2020 and was feeling great except dizziness which I managed till the time COVID happened. I again started having symptoms out of the blue in June. And from June 2020 till Feb 2021 I was again on Lexapro 5 mg plus Clonazepam 0.5 mg. I never felt this good and dizziness also went away this time around. I wante to quit and Doctor again told me the same. Quit taking clonazepam cold turkey and take Lexapro 5 mg for another month and again quit that too. 

But this time I felt uncomfortable quitting clonazepam cold turkey. So I kept on taking 0.25 mg and I stabilized. After a month I quit Lexapro 5 mg and kept taking 0.25 mg clonazepam. So by March, 2021, I quit Lexapro and was taking only 0.25 clonazepam. I felt normal till April 2021 and around in May, 2021 again I started feeling weird. But I have stayed on clonazepam 0.25 till now and although I don't feel normal but have been able to manage the symptoms.

I have two queries. Am I feeling the symptoms due to Lexapro withdrawal or cut in clonazepam dose?
Will the symptoms ever go? It has already been three months since I am only taking clonazepam 0.25 but I don't feel normal just like when I was on Lexapro 5 mg plus 0.5 mg Clonazepam. Please help.",3

Sometimes 2mg xanax mixed with a few kpins, sometimes a regretful dose of 70mg ambien.
Out of all three drugs I used kpins the least (maybe 3 times since may).

Again, these were usually spaced apart by a week or two. I stuck to this thinking that enough time between such doses would mitigate dependency and withdrawals but I think that my anxiety has been higher than usual. I would also notice that after each night of ‘fun’ (fuck me i know) I would start feeling heavy and anxious for around a week (which would gradually get better).

I felt pretty good for the past few days with a little bit of anxiety here and there. I had the ambien binge on the 22nd of June and hadnt taken anything else until last night where I took 1mg xanax with a tiny bit of clonazepam (quarter of a 0.5 pill) and a swig of wine.

Also I personally find it takes a lot of head work when your brains too mashed up to think properly and too much mind chatter and intrusive OCD thoughts going on all the time   


I eyeballed  many meds to taper off over the year's besides Benzos and never heard  about weighing  cuts and dose until I joined BB, and I wish I'd never seen that as it  just gave me yet something else get freaked out, and paranoid  over.

 But  I'm back to eyeballing and have been for some time and it served me  well for many year's before that  to taper off all sorts. My symptoms  are still severe and crappy whether I weigh the pills or not and I'd rather not  have the extra anxiety about weighing them  myself.",0

I’m at a residential mental health facility. My doctor wanted me to cut the dose in half for the taper. I couldn’t convince him to do 5-10% reductions but I convinced him to drop to 0.375mg. I’ve been on this lower dose for 3 days and my depression and anxiety are very bad. 

Does it make sense to stay at this dose until I stabilize rather than go back up and start over? Someone told me the symptoms should stabilize within 2 weeks. 

I could probably convince the doc to get me 0.25 + 1/2 of a 0.125 for my next reduction, whenever I stabilize on the current dose. 

How do you find a doctor who is willing to support an Ashton style slow taper? Every doctor I’ve talked to does pretty fast tapers. 

I thought this schedule might work and be more digestible to a doctor, over 3-4 months. Thoughts? 

0.375 started July 1 

1/2 0.5 + 1/2 0.125 = 0.3125

2021-07-04 16:07:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/odrzjs/perhaps_some_inspiration/,Perhaps some inspiration.,"I recently reflected on my life and what I have done that might be useful for others to know. I think my benzodiazepines recovery story is definitely one of those things. 

I had taken benzodiazepines for weeks at a time, quite a few times, as I have a life long mental health disorder which manifests itself in periods of intense psychological distress. Obviously benzodiazepines are a great way to take the edge off heavy emotions and problems. I took zopiclone at night time for a while a few years ago, and thereafter for about 4 months continuously, and then slowly but surely worked my way up to taking 40 mgs (sometimes 60, sometimes 80) of diazepam a day. 

At first I did one month, and stopped. Had to get off them. Oh my Christ was I not ready for the fresh hell that awaited me. I felt cold. All the time. I had no joy, I had no comfort, I could sleep only very small amounts at a time and if something made me anxious or gave me adrenaline it just sky rocketed and I couldn't get calm for about an hour. My brain felt like it was a broken TV, glitching and fuzzing, and I was constantly having panic attacks over having seizures. Never had one due to benzo recovery (that I know of) and after about two weeks of this I decided I couldn't cope with it and bought more diazepam online. And the undescribable hell went away.

Life was so much easier with diazepam. I was calm, I could concentrate on my work, I had no panic, I had few (I think possibly none large ones) episodes. It was OK. And then of course, after about 6 months of this I realised it had to stop. I came out to everyone including my GP and local drug recovery service. 

I was put on a taper of 5mg every 2 weeks. That's just how they do it here. I can tell you for sure that it's too fast. Life was once again a constant barrage of hell. Pain in my body like id never imagined, fuzzy glitches of brain. The human experience at its absolute worst, I have no doubt. The feelings of solumn despair and hopelessness coupled with awful sleep and nothing but concern for what awful symptom I was going to feel next. I was broken and it was never going to improve. I would be a retarded mess forever. This would probably be OK if I didn't have to work as well. I forced myself to go to work and keep busy, and that was practically the only thing that got me through. The last few weeks were the hardest by far, but once I had stopped taking anything, I was determined to give it up for good. Slowly but surely the worry and anxst dampened. Light at the end of the tunnel! I personally had waves of feeling OK intermittent with waves of dread and worry and agitated overexcitatory fuzzyness. 

Eventually it ended. And I'm now very glad to report that I have only had one slip up since, 3 days worth, and it just made me realise how much I didn't want to go back there. I'm also now about to publish my 4rd, 5th and 6th peer reviewed research article and finished my PhD and have a job at one of the best universities in the world. 

It is difficult, but you can and will get through it, and just bare in mind that having issues with substances doesn't define you, and you absolutely should not let it. Having said all this, it does take a lot of mental strength to overcome these things, but once you have done it, you have that strength for life, and you can apply it to other things and be the incredible person you were born to be. Once you have defeated your taper, I have a solid and incredible respect for you, because you have managed to overcome something that I consider one of the worst experiences a human can go through. There are stories of rehab, how the heroin recovery people actually feel sorry for the benzo recovery people. 

You can do this.",33

Anywho, I forced myself into a month long taper on may 30 and my last dose of opiate was a few days ago on June 30. all of my past efforts to quit were pretty horrific and I refused to get on methadone or suboxen because I was afraid of swapping one addiction for another so tapering more slowly than I’d tried in the past seemed like the best option
The 30 day taper worked pretty well, minimal sweats, GI upset, and muscle cramping. What was awful was the insomnia. So I stupidly started taking Xanax a week into my taper about an hour before bed and slept like a baaaaby. I thought the stuff was miraculous. Until I read about how horrible benzo addiction and withdrawal are. After going through LITERAL HELL with fentanyl, I decided right then and there to stop the Xanax. I was taking 1/4th of a Xanax bar and it put me out like a light and I would have the best sleep but 2 nights ago was my last dose due to what I’d read about benzo withdrawal. Last night I had horrrrrrible sleep. Tossing, turning, racing thoughts, tingly feelings in my stomach, sweaty/clammy cold hands and feet… So I guess as the title states, is it possible to have gotten addicted to .25 mgs in only 3 weeks?? If so, will the withdrawal last a long time even if I wasn’t taking it for a long time? Will I ever be able to sleep normally again? (I haven’t had a night of no drug sleep in over 2 years, last night was my first attempt and it was miserable.) I know how stupid this must sound to those who have been taking benzos for years but I’m so scared of more suffering. Any advice or words words of encouragement would be sooo immensely appreciated right now.

Days 1-4: I felt fine

Days 5-9: mild symptoms that were improving as the days went by

Day 10: felt really pretty good

Day 11: got slammed and had to call out of work days 12 and 13

Day 14: felt slightly better, but blood pressure and heart rate started increasing to concerning ranges

Day 15: BP and HR high enough to prompt a call to psychiatrist

Day 16: blood pressure and heart rate started getting back to less concerning ranges (no med changes), but emergence of different symptoms (muscle spasms, rib/sternum pain)

Day 17 (today): blood pressure and heart rate better, not ideal, but not anywhere near dangerous. Pain still present, but improving.

I thought I was in the clear on day 4. I again thought I was in the clear on day 10. Am I in the clear now? Who knows. I've learned a lesson here. This crap is NOT LINEAR. And both times I got optimistic I had stabilized, I was let down by the emergence of new symptoms. 

I decided a couple of days ago that there's no more expectations. I'm treating each day as independent of the previous one. How I feel on any given day is not a good predictor of how I will feel the next. Hopefully this will help with the mental aspect while I'm dealing with this hellish process.

I voiced my intention to get off Klonopin. She said she would like me to take the meds every other day and then gave me Seroquel and Zoloft to manage with getting off Klonopin and still have my sleep. 

My old psych sent me messages midnight asking me to take Klonopin every other day until all (6 pcs left) are consumed and cease from there. 

Now, yesterday, I had a hard time getting to bed and after about an hour of trying to get sleep (I usually go to bed at 9pm), I took Melatonin (3mg) to aid with my sleep. I was able to sleep until 12:30am when I was disturbed by the messages from the old psych. Naturally, I had trouble sleeping from there but was able to fall back to sleep around 1am and woken up by 5:20am today. So if I count the sleep minus the broken 30mins, I was asleep and had dreams for 7hrs. 

Now, I am contemplating if I will still take Klonopin tonight or just directly cold turkey. My timeline of Klonopin was 6 days of 1mg and 15 days of 0.5 mg. I don’t feel any weird thing right now but it’s only last night that I did not take Klonopin. 

What is the best thing to do? I am in Asia btw so GMT+8.",1

Constant ruminating over everything, paranoia/racing thoughts, on the verge of panic attacks sometimes, and slight agoraphobia but I am sleeping well. I wasn’t expecting to feel this anxious at this cut because up until now I had been cutting .25mg every three days and feeling fine. This is day four of taking 1mg a day (.5 in morning .25 midday and .25 at night). I started the taper at 1.75mg and was only taking that much for about a month. Prior to that I was only taking .25mg-.5mg everyday for about a year or two. 

I know these a relatively small doses but I was started on these meds for panic disorder, ptsd, ocd, and gad, so the rebound symptoms hit me like bricks and idk if it’s my mental illnesses or the rebound making it bad. Probably both, but idk how long to wait until I “level out”.

How do I know when I should make the next cut?

2021-07-03 04:50:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ocublj/what_recovery_feels_like_after_benzos/,What recovery feels like after Benzos,"Change becomes less obvious when it is small and consistent, lost within an extended haze of suffering. It is less obvious when things improve because the focus shifts to all the things that plague us that still remain. 

Suffering can feel endless, and it is easy for hope to diminish when the only reality you have to project is that of the current state of fear and unhappiness you currently reside in. 

I compare and contrast progress religiously, allowing the shadows of doubt to etch into my subconscious and feed into the voice in my head that tells me “I will never heal” or “this is it for me”.

Why is it so easy to believe the story of healing from the seemingly un-healable, until it is begging to be a part of the narrative we tell ourselves? 

The scary narrative voice is not a new one. She has always been there, but finds herself front and centre during this time of excruciating vulnerability. She thinks she is protecting me, figuring out all the worst scenarios and shutting them down before they can happen. She doesn’t realise the fear caused by her voice, that threatens to get louder and louder at each stage of recovery. She thrives on turnings fears of the unknown into future “facts” and the “what-if” scenarios into a made-up reality. 

What has improved? I ask myself this constantly but the changes are found in the places we tend not to look at. This seems annoying and inconvenient, in the quest to evaluating healing, but upon further inspection, I realise the importance of the slow and unnoticeable nature of this change. 

A friend I met in a toxicity recovery group once told me that “healing will be the absence of symptoms, the absence of fear, rather than the presence of something”. She told me that the gradual absence of these things would be too slow to observe and that my brain would naturally focus on the new or remaining symptoms. 

This sentiment reminds me of life in a more generalised way. The absence of problems never means eternal peace. The way in which time has a magical way of removing our focus from a nagging issue, one that plagued our every waking thought making it feel as if we’d never escape from it. It reminds me of a breakup, when each minute of every day feels excruciatingly painful, almost as if time stops or moves at snail pace. We do not observe the gradual improvements, nor notice the tiny steps that soon add up to a marathon of healing. One day we are better, happy, over it. We have moved on and our time, energy, sadness, happiness and worry are used up on other parts of our life, and thus continues the cycle. 

I am by no means reducing the hell-on-earth experience of benzo down to the feelings post-breakup. However there is a familiar feeling about “never getting over” something and time slowing down that rings equivocally true for me. At the very least it’s the notion of tiny steps of healing, on the path back to health and happiness. It is not until you look back that you see how far you’ve come. 

Today as I went about my day I worried and focussed on the DR/DP, that’s as I remembered, followed me around for the last 12 months. It renders me fearful and uncomfortable in public robbing me of 
 feeling balanced. I noticed the aching in my head and back, the feeling of nausea and annoying level of fatigue. 

What I didn’t notice or think about all day however, was, the fact that for many weeks or months I could not drive and I constantly worried about how I ever would feel comfortable doing so again. The same with the severe agoraphobia, the 7 months I could not even gather energy for a walk, the searing depression that turned me into a walking zombie begging regularly for death, and yet this morning, I’ve been to gym, seen a friend and driven around reasonably comfortably, without really appreciating that I’m doing these things again or giving a second thought to the tiny steps that got me here. 

Things are not perfect, I am definitely not near 100%, but improvement and healing are in the places you don’t look at anymore. 

Hope is in the gradual process, the absence of something rather than the presence of something else. The path to health and healing doesn’t happen overnight, much to mine and I’m sure many other people’s dismay and impatience.  

It is laughing with a friend again, driving, feeling happy about minor things, smelling bacon again when you walk past the local cafe, it is going 30 mins without thinking about symptoms, looking forward to rather than dreading plans, it is the tiny moments that join together over time that snuff out the misery of being unwell. 

It is these seemingly minuscule moments  of hope that help to erase the feelings of doubt, until one day you look back, and truly are in awe with appreciation at just how far you’ve come.",52

In the past week especially, with the last few days being probably the worst, I have experienced significant anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and a sort of dream like feeling sometimes with a lot of brain fog. I took some adderall today and when I was coming down my anxiety got worse and I was desperate for some relief and I managed to find probably about .5mg worth of a 1mg pill I had and I took it. I’m feeling a bit of relief right now, but I officially can’t get any more pills until my doctor appointment next Wednesday. 
I don’t know If I should continue the cold Turkey or do a taper. 

I have been using benzos for 5 years on and off, usually about 3 months at a time and I don’t think I’ve ever really tapered. I’ve been on 4-6mg Xanax for several months before and 2-3mg of klonopin a day in the past, and would never take them together so if I was on a several month long cycle of one benzo I would quit and stop for several months and then continue again. I also took clonazolam for probably a month and a half about 4 years ago, and cold turkeyd off that. I really want to get off of these drugs, they have never really helped my anxiety that significantly, the only thing that completely killed it was clonazolam but it would be a borderline blackout dose and I would be visibly fucked up. 

I have a history of heavy drinking 3-5 times a week and at my worst I would have 15+ drinks and then the nights I wasn’t drinking I would take a benzo. I would appreciate any advice on where to go from here and I’m wondering if I made things worse with the dose I took today 2 weeks into a cold Turkey and if it affects the withdrawal process significantly.",1
2021-07-02 14:23:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ocg0s9/simultaneous_benzostimulant_paws/,Simultaneous benzo/stimulant PAWS?,"I’m nearly 11 months into PAWS after quitting clonazepam (1.5 month taper from 0.5 mg/day for nearly 3 years). Been dealing with “normal” PAWS symptoms most of the past year, which has been frustrating - especially since it seems very drawn out for such a low dose and relatively short timeframe of use before a termination that wasn’t cold turk.

However, after talking with my newish therapist today, he noted that some of what I described of the past week or so also sounds a lot like stimulant-related PAWS…I didn’t even know that was also a thing. 

His point was that my brief taper from Adderall (25 mg/day [20 mg XR + 5 mg] for 12 years) before switching to Strattera at the same time I was tapering from benzos may have triggered what I’ll call poly-PAWS, which actually makes a lot of sense.

While he indicated that there’s not any real risk of “super-symptoms” or wild triggers of delayed psychosis or anything like that, I’m still trying to understand what the possible implications might be for the nature/duration of such a complex recovery process - or if it changes anything at all other than the possible origin of a given symptom, which is fairly passive.

Would really appreciate feedback on my taper plan because I'm absolutely terrified of what's ahead.,"I'll try to keep this succinct. I've been prescribed benzos for 2.5 years. I started on .5mg of Ativan for a few months, then dropped down to .25mg with minimal symptoms. I should've just quit then but I'm an idiot and stayed there for another few months until I started getting interdose withdrawal. My doctor moved me over to 2.50mg of Diazepam/Valium per day instead. Been there ever since.

I know it's a low dose compared to a lot of the situations you folks are in and I probably sound like a little crybaby, but I'm a polysubstance addict in recovery and minimizing symptoms as much as possible is crucial if I want to avoid my life devolving into chaos. 

My plan is to cut by 5% every 4 weeks until I'm off using volumetric dosing. I figure I've already been on taking benzos long enough that another year isn't the end of the world if it means I can make tiny drops and wait until I've fully stabilized, assuming an 100 hour elimination half-life (I know some sources claim it's shorter but I'd rather overshoot than undershoot).

I take Mirtazapine, Olanzapine, Lamotrogene and Aprazaloam all prescribed by a psychiatrist and taken as prescribed.  The dose for Aprazaloam is 1mg instant release tablets four times a day.  I don't ever abuse Rx and try to take less of the Aprazaloam.  I have been on Aprazaloam for about twenty years.  I don't drink or have substance abuse issues.  I do know I am both physically and mentally addicted to aprazaloam at this point even though there is no abuse.  I do smoke cannabis regularly.  I don't consider myself a ""user"" of aprazaloam simply because I associate that word with use or abuse that isn't prescribed.  This may be wrong and maybe I need to look at the Rx as using.  


I discussed my long-term use of aprazaloam with my psychiatrist and his position is that the Rx is working, so there is no reason to stop.  It is his position the aprazaloam is effective and safe when taken as prescribed and not abused.  I'm not sure I agree with him.  Past relationships have failed.  My last girlfriend was adamant that the aprazaloam has permanently impaired my ability to remain calm in awkward situations.  She would often use the word ""freak out"" to describe my behavior.  I can't put my personality shortfalls on a prescribed Rx.  I researched myself the long-term side effects and I'm afraid she's correct.  Stopping has me scared to death because I am just barely functioning as it is.  


Here is my question...  If I am not abusing the aprazaloam and it is effective should I try to stop the medication at this point by finding another psychiatrist who supports me going off the aprazaloam?  I must point out that the psychiatrist I have now has been the best in my lifetime because he tried new medications and diagnosed me differently than other doctors.  Any thoughts are appreciated.  


I feel like my mind has changed and I can't remember things.  It is like I have a constant brain fog.  I'm afraid it is from the long-term use of Aprazaloam.  Anyone have a similar experience?

Was taking 1.5mg now I’m down to .5mg.  It’s getting more and more difficult but I’m confident.  I’ll soon be tapering down to .25mg. I was wondering after that do I take the jump? Or should I taper even more? Especially cutting the .25mgs in halves?,4

2021-07-01 19:33:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/oby12h/benzo_withdrawal_getting_worse_after_each/,Benzo withdrawal getting worse after each withdrawal?,"It's really weird but I remember when Valerian root non-prescription pills hit me like Ativan did for the first few days. I was motivated and talkative and felt a glow throughout my body. Then for alcohol withdrawals I took Ativan regularly for a month which worked really well the first few days but at the end of the withdrawal I felt scattered. A couple months later I got Ativan again but barely had any effects. So one month of abstinence later I went on Klonopin for a few weeks and it worked pretty well for the whole time I was on it until the end, which wasn't the case for Ativan. 

But then I was forced into involuntary psychiatric commitment and got off the benzos with a quick benzo taper. I won't speak about the main wihdrawals as I was mostly dissociating, being in constant fear but the paws felt like forever and then almost a year later I got back on Klonopin and I had less effects than I had before I was forced to quit. Is there some kind of kindling effect going on, where each withdrawal keeps on getting worse? Is it possibly the same in the case where you you're stabilized on Klonopin but take Valium as needed sometimes 4 days a week up to 30mg, could this theoretically speaking also lead to some kindling effects leading to a higher tolerance (possibly some permatolerance) and withdrawal?",1
