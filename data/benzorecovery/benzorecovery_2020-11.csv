I've been on benzos for about four months, starting with .5mg of Klonopin. I quickly realised it made me feel awful so tried to cold turkey, learned this was a terrible idea, developed tinnitus etc. Now I'm on 2.5mg diazepam and tapering from there.

Aside from all the more ""objective"" withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and seizures, the thing I'm really worrying about at the moment is the anhedonia. I used to be sharp, and now I feel completely lobotomised.

In order to be happy in life I have to be able to watch TV shows, play video games, make music etc - I just tried to play a video game for about 15 minutes and quickly gave up because I just felt too stupid and sedated to make sense of it. Even reading the text on screen feels like too much effort.

Will my brain come back after this, will I be able to feel again? I feel like I've essentially thrown away my ability to enjoy life - food, social interactions, nothing feels natural anymore and life itself feels like a chore. If I manage to come out of this taper without protracted withdrawals, will I ever get back that feeling of normal cognition? Does it get better so I can go back to truly living? You might laugh, but if I can't play a video game I don't see how I can move on with my life. I don't want to be sitting in my room staring at a wall forever. If you're like me and highly value things like music and games, you'll know what I'm talking about. For those who have been off, does the magic come back? Please help.",5,0

I’m a guitar player/teacher and all I care about is being able to play with ease and retain information. Which drug is better for this?If anyone could help me that would be great.

This can drive the sufferer to suicide or in some instances homocide. I’ve developed it due to benzo tolerance and tapering thus makes it even worse. My day today consisted of waking up and feeling like I was exploding from my skin, I had a urge that I needed to die to escape. (Still do) So I screamed, hit myself, threw a few things and sobbed. I can’t get away from it. My family is the only reason why I’m alive. They say no matter what we’re going to beat this. I’ve been surviving off ensure shakes and a very little bit of solid food. My CNS is literally on fire and food is the last thing I want. My skin burns, my brain on fire. It’s all out survival. It’s no longer withdrawal it’s literally survival. Tolerance withdrawal to this level isn’t unheard of but it is uncommon. Check out The Akathisia Alliances website where this is documented and explained. My options right now is I’m going to try medical marijuana. I also need off my benzodiazepine to truly resolve the akathisia but am very very clueless on how to taper in such shape. I’m sharing my story because I took a low dose as prescribed for 6 years and this happened. I’m 26. I worked full time, played music, golfed, and was a functioning member of society. Now I’m disabled fighting a invisible illness for my life. No help from Doctors, No help from Government(can’t even get on disability).

I’ve played it safe for 2 years now to keep my slowly regrowing gabaergic system intact....if I have to keep playing it safe because I’m still tapering the ssri that’s no problem with me...I never want to go back to full on PAWS-land again.

My question is: will I be okay? Was this binge dangerous and will I be ok taking the lorazepam later?

I can feel fine skipping a day or two, I'm guessing because of diclazepam's long half-life, but on day three there is an urge to dose again, which is usually placated with .5-1mg. 

I believe I'd feel fine at 1mg every other day, but again my dosing is so inconsistent **I don't know if I'm even physically dependent enough to warrant a taper, and if I am I don't know what dose I should start at.**

Any advice is appreciated.",2,0

I’m far from the ‘peak’ of what I was when I first initially started, withdrawal, but I’m definitely not feeling myself. I feel boring & ‘flat’ & can’t seem to connect with others whilst making conversation. In fact I can barely think of anything to make a conversation about.

So I'm on subutex, 2mg daily and have been for a few years after opiate addiction. I started in 16mg and have tapered down. 

Since covid 19, well I'd say 3 months. I've started using xanax to cope. Started off at 0.25mg-0.5mg a few times a week but for the last couple months I've been taking between 0.25mg to 1mg every night and I am ashamed to say I abuse it by snorting. Most nights is 0.5. It settles my anxiety and gets me to sleep.

Ive got 3 tabs left and then I have no more. They were from a friend and her script has stopped. I'm a nurse. I can't work going through WD and I have never before this in my life used benzos as more than a one off occurance. Next week I have to give a clean urine for my subutex script. I guess my question is realistically am I looking at bad withdrawals? I know the doses I'm taking are low and within therapeutic range but I'm also snorting them and know even a therapeutic dose can lead to dependance 

What would you do in my situation, is it best to taper with my remaining stock of 3 x 0.5mg and if so how? Or shall I just not take anymore and see how I feel?

I take about 20mg of clonazolam a day, and 12g of kratom a  day.

Obviously I'd prefer to  taper as slow as possible, but I'm down to about 2 days worth of benzos,  and I can't get this program (Kleopatra) to work, in order to buy more  off the darkweb. Not to mention it wouldn't arrive until next week.

I  really have no idea what to expect if I go in. No idea how miserable  I'll feel, or how long they'll keep me. I'm fucking terrified, and to  top it all off, both me and my dog have extreme separation anxiety.

If  I can even get the program working to order more benzos, should I even  buy the clonazolam? It's fucked me up so much, and I just want it to be  over. Also considering switching to diclazepam.

My  skepticism comes in after doing a lot of reading about doctors and  their knowledge on benzos. They seriously don't seem to know jack shit  about proper titration, and from what I've heard will just keep you for  4-7 days (before the WDs peak), and tell you to stop taking benzos.

I  have a lot of questions about detox centers, but since they vary so  much, I think it'd be best to just ask for anyone's experience going  through this.

I'm probably going  to give them a call at some point today to ask a few questions, but even  thinking about it makes me insanely stressed out.

I just want to chill. I can't do anything the entire day, even rest in my bed or meditate is getting hard.

Given this, I am accepting taking half a pill of V and then doing a much more slower taper. Or then starting Abilify as two psychs want me to start. I wonder what is the less worse option.

Also... is it late to go back to 100mg of Zoloft? Is it worth going back? Have in mind that I am totally ok with having to taper my AD in the future and I am okay with extending the journey. If the therapeutic phase after some weeks has the power to control these intrusive thoughts so I am OK with waiting some more days to the ""worsening before getting good"" phase from ADs to pass.

Advice?,"Just to summarize my usage:  I was prescribed .5mg Klonopin for anxiety last fall. My dr gave me a script for 20 of them and it took me almost 6 months to finish it. I only took it when I was at my most anxious. Cut to this April and my anxiety is through the roof so I ask for a refill. She gives me a script for 30 .5mg and 5 refills. I took them sporadically through the spring and summer, at least a 2-3 times a week. Towards the end of August/early September (I don’t recall exactly when), I started taking them every night at bed.  I started to get worried about dependency and about 3 weeks ago, asked my dr if it was ok to get off and she said cold turkey would be fine. I’m sensitive to side effects (the dizziness from Klonopin is another reason I want to quit) so I decided to do my own taper. I cut down to .25mg every night for two weeks, one week of .25mg every other day and as of last Thursday night, have been cold turkey.  The jump from .5 to .25 was fine but the every other day of .25 gave me a killer migraine and I’m super dizzy.   It’s a weird headache, like the pressure from a sinus infection in the top of my head but no nasal symptoms. I’m wondering if I tapered a little too fast or jumped too soon. I feel pretty crappy and flu-ish, and I’m having rebound anxiety and insomnia.  It’s not debilitating but I don’’t know if I can handle weeks and weeks of this. Any advice on moving forward?  I’m thinking I should’ve stayed a little longer on the daily .25  and then maybe switched to .125 daily before the jump. 

I should note that I’ve never taken more than .5 in a 24 hour period and never mixed with other drugs or alcohol. If I had drinks in the evening, I would always skip Klonopin. I was hoping having been on such a low dose would keep my from having bad withdrawals but I still feel pretty rough.  Any advice or encouragement is greatly appreciated!

Trigger warning for symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Sorry for the long post. 

I promised myself I'd revisit all the benzo forums and groups I was a part of to update on how things are going once I jumped off (I'm using a newer account). It's true that when you start feeling better you're less inclined to hang round these pages, I tend to stay away now as I can read about a symptom and then experience it a day later.

So, 10 months off! And things are improving. It's been slow going and hard to see day to day improvements but looking back to where I was in 2018 and 2019 it's an amazing difference. I would say I'm about 60 - 70% recovered. Some days I feel 100% recovered. 

- I can cook again!
- I can hike 3-4 miles, peak w/d I couldn't even make it up the stairs
- sleep is back
- tremors almost gone, stress and lack of sleep trigger it but it's no longer constant
- no more constant diarrhoea
- heart palpitations have gone
- I can travel in the car again, I couldn't before as driving on hills would give me vertigo
- I'm back at work! Work is still a struggle due to memory issues but I'm hanging in there
- I can tolerate Vitamin D supplements now. I have yet to try anything else as just one multivitamin used to rev up my symptoms

The three things I mainly still struggle with:
- tinnitus (pulsatile and normal, getting worse with time)
- memory issues/brain fog
- the benzo fear (that thing where you're just terrified of everything or something going wrong all the time) 

New issues that have occurred since jumping off:
- mainly around inflammation. A week after jumping off I developed rosacea quite bad, it's a skin condition and linked to inflammation. I get random rashes all the time and I've now also developed something called Cold Urticaria - big itchy welts when I go out in the cold. I've developed a lot of food allergies too. My bloods aren't normal and a lot of things are out of wack still as I recover. 

I was really suffering during my 18 month taper, the worst was August 2019. I can pinpoint many moments where I just felt like I couldn't go on anymore, I wanted to die, I didn't know how to get through the next minute, the suffering was enormous. But I got through it somehow. I thought jumping would be the hardest bit but actually it was fine, I think cause I tapered to a low dose. 

I posted this not to brag but to reassure that even if you think you won't recover, you will. I had kindled a lot and my withdrawal was brutal. We all have different timelines with our recovery but I wanted to check in as when I was in the midst of withdrawal I thought it would always be like that. But we all recover

If you're struggling with symptoms, you will get through it. Your symptoms WILL improve and you will heal. You may think that you've had enough, but you are strong and capable and will get through it. Keep going!!",44,0

I want off.,"I was prescribed alprazolam at age 13 after a number of panic attacks (looking back, my psychiatrist that I still see *really* could have sought out an alternative option before sedating me, The Hormonal Teenage Girl). I was switched on to clonazepam when I was 16...ish? Well, I'm still on it at age 25. I've asked my psychiatrist how to get off and he always says something along the lines of, ""Well, you could cut your pills into quarters and wean off that way, *buuut,* I really think you should wait until you finish college/settle into your new job/work through your recent breakup/etc. because you're gonna be under a lot of stress...""

Well, I feel like my entire cognitive ability is churned up in the Benzo Blender 2000 because I lose my train of thought and forget names, words, people, and y'know, most of my life's memories like an 85-year-old (with dementia, I daresay), not a 25-year-old. My perception of reality is blurry and I'm in a constant fog. My inhibition is oftentimes nonexistent and my tolerance for pain (and desire to ""feel something"") has increased by *a lot*. I'm as tired as a corpse, I twitch like an undead corpse, and I have the emotional sum of a corpse (read: virtually none).

Basically, I'm just hoping that, one: someone can relate and tell me I'm not (as) crazy (as I feel) and, two: someone can offer some encouraging words for beginning my taper, whatever method I end up choosing, and for the long, long road ahead. I know I'm not going to heal completely, but I would really like to feel, y'know, emotions again. Maybe even *desire intimacy* from my fiance? Boy, that'd be nice.

The doctor who prescribed me this said basically nothing about coming off it, I have only learned how hard it is through starting to research it weeks after starting. 

I started taking them approx 10 weeks ago following a friend's suicide, hoping to find treatment for visual snow, tinnitus and anxiety. In this time I have dabbled with tramadol and alcohol.

About two weeks ago I had hit tolerance and cut my dose from half a .5 tab daily to a quarter (.125 once daily), freaked myself out at the onset of withdrawals and tried to go cold turkey which I've since learned is NOT something you do. I experienced about 4 days of panic, and am worried this might have been enough to cause kindling or some kind of damage (I suddenly have REALLY bad tinnitus).

At 10 weeks in, I'm not entirely sure where to go from here or whether I will make a full recovery. I know I'm not in the same realm as people who were on 8mg a day for 10 years, but I'm still worried this is gonna leave me picking up the pieces for many months.

&#x200B;

I guess my main question is, if I'm stable on 1/8 tab for a few more weeks where do I go from there? If I switch to Valium/Diazepam what dose should I aim for? Would I be able to jump off from 1/8 (.06mg daily) without risking PAWS? Need some advice as my doctor doesn't seem to be giving much away. I don't want to lose my hair or end up with years of tinnitus and tremors. Please help!",2,0

this has meant that i've been taking it daily, (for over a month now i reckon),and therefore have (probably) become addicted or at least physically and mentally dependent on it. my doctor has decided to stop prescribing it to me and is getting me to reduce my dose to none at all, but i'm so scared.

i have a crippling fear of throwing up /feeling sick (this is why i needed the diazepam in the first place because of the constant and crippling panic attacks about being sick) and i saw that the withdrawal from valium/diazepam includes a lot of nausea and vomiting. do you guys think i've been taking a high enough dose for a long enough time to induce this kind of withdrawal when i eventually come off it?? 

i'm reducing it by 1mg every few days and i'm just terrified. i can't handle throwing up or being sick and my doctor doesn't seem to think it's going to be an issue and that tapering off over a couple of weeks will mean i won't feel much of a withdrawal at all, but i'm so afraid that he's wrong. what do you guys think? if you've been in this - or a similar - position, please, please tell me how it went or what to expect. i'm so scared. thank you.",1,0

Hey, I was addicted to Benzo and Ambien for 2 years at high dosages. I withdraw for a few months with the help of a dr and the last time I took any drug was almost 5 years ago.

I'm aware that benzo withdrawal can be extremely protracted compared to other drugs, and most of my issues went away, however the skin issues persisted (albeit better than they used to).

My skin can get quite sensitive, especially at the neck line and behind the knees which makes wearing clothes with it quite a nuisance. Also daytime showers (even with mild/cold water) make my skin so much worse so I now only shower at night which still makes me a bit more sensitive. Another issue is I sometimes still get this stinging feeling on my skin, like a week sunburn. It used to be quite painful, now it's just mild.

I was told the skin and nerve issues staying for this long could be tied to my low b12 levels which I used to have. But I've been on b12 supplementation for the past 3 years and raised my levels to normal.

I'd appreciate it so much if anyone could take the time to think of anything which might help me. Coming off of drugs was difficult enough on it's own. I'm just hoping I didn't destroy my body for good..",7,0

I think I’m having mild withdrawal.,"The last time I took Klonopin was almost 11 days ago at .50mg. I was taking that dose 3-4 nights a week at night for sleep and night time anxiety. I used it for about a month. Prior to that I was on Ambien 5mg for 2 weeks and I used .25-.50mg of Ativan for about 3 weeks before that also about 4 nights a week. I didn’t taper the Klonopin since I wasn’t on it daily and took low doses. This past week I started feeling off around the 7 day mark with a super bloated stomach, gastrointestinal issues, feeling dazed, lethargic and having some mild physical anxiety come back. I sometimes get a ringing in my ear for few seconds. Last night I had heart palpitations that woke me up at 3AM even though I was sleeping well for the past 4 weeks. Couldn’t go back to sleep. Last week I had a head ache that lasted for 3 days and I had a burning nerve pain in my legs which I tend to get when I don’t take benzos for a few days. I’m wondering if these are mild withdrawal symptoms since I’m assuming the Klonopin is out of my system by now. If they are withdrawal symptoms, have I already gone through the worst of it at the 11 day mark? 

I’m pretty sure I experienced inter-dose 
withdrawal with the Ativan and Ambien 2 months ago since I went through the most traumatic experience of my life with severe insomnia, burning nerve pain in my legs all day, shaking, leg convulsions, restlessness and feeling my heart pounding all day, and waking up with anxiety attacks feeling all the nerves in my body. I’m really scared of ever going through that again with my biggest fear being the severe insomnia coming back. 

I’ve also been on Lexapro for 6 weeks and started taking Trazadone for sleep last week so my other guess would be that are side effects of starting the traz.

This is, of course, personal experience and your mileage may vary. Also, I'm sure there have been similar topics so apologies if this has been posted many times before. I don't reddit very much these days. But....

For those who are not using NMDA Antagonists and are dependent on benzodiazepines, thienodiazepines, or opioids, you should be. I had virtually no withdrawal symptoms after tapering benzos and using Agamtine, over-the-counter DXM (DXM ONLY, not the kind with Tylenol or expectorants or antihistamines), daily Magneisum Citrate (so I can poop when taking Kratom), and I have an order of Memantine on the way. Also, a Ketamine analogue.

Seriously, little to no withdrawal symptoms. This is in a person who previously experienced a horrendous 5-6 month post-acute withdrawal syndrome with horrible insomnia, GI symptoms, chest buzzing, agoraphobia, chest pain, the works - following a 4-year period of benzo abuse.

These days I try and use the occasional sleep aid and cycle benzos, Soma, Hydroxyzine (aka Atarax, an antihistamine), Phenibut, and Baclofen. I use 750mg-1000mgs of Agamtine daily with little to no side effects (mostly increased hunger / sugar cravings and a little diminished effects on opioids and benzos), but with the benefit that I experience a very much reduced withdrawal syndrome when coming off of any drug. There are peer-reviewed studies showing the efficacy of administering Agmatine and other NMDA antagonists with benzodiazpeines and.or opiods for redution in tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence.

I also feel my high fat low carb diet plays a good role in reduction of tolerance/dependance/withdrawal. I am pretty much on the Keto diet, but allow myself cheat days on the weekend with a little ice cream and Mountain Dew. I also get regular cardio in the way of 45 mins on the elliptical every day.

PSA for all you druggies who want to save yourself from some serious mental anguish. It works for me and my girlfriend. Exercise, NMDA Antagonists, and moderation is the key.

Now I am terrified I will develop withdrawals when I stop so i am looking for some calming and hopefully reassuring input because although I shouldn't google, I dont even know who to believe because some consultants have also even expressed mixed opinions yet my consultant who prescribed them is Analytical Head lead MD and Mental health Directing figure for my city's mental health and so one would hope he is the most qualified one to go on.

It's difficult to specifically include my medication for the first year as it included a high dose range of diazepam,  Clonazepam, lorazepam and so forth with no idea when or where I had it,  however I am going to disinclude this as I had a 7month gap before reinitaiting benzos from February which consisted of 10mgs of Diazepam once every two or three days for the first couple of months and then ever since has been lorazepam 2mg which I had used basically every third or fourth day of the month and zopiclone every other night, in the 28 days of every month each use was roughly 8 or 9 days out of every month in missed intervals. My consultant has expressed that because of the low/infrequent usage, withdrawal symptoms at most would be some insomnia for a week or two and I would be safe to stop.

Upon challenging that, he explained that people can be treated for a month even longer on doses like 6mg lorazepam every day and such minimal quantities included using in infrequent routine would make the risk of withdrawal symptoms so low especially considering the benzodiazepine was primarily a short acting for the substantial programme and so in comparison to using this fashion had it been only diazepam which poses the likely hood of some dependence due to the overlapping half life, I am safe.

I've been on clonazepam since April of this year. I was able to taper down from 1mg to .5mg clonazepam and I've never been happier. I've remained on .5mg daily, once in the morning, for about two months now. I've gotten comfortable but I know I need to take the next step. 

I want to attempt to break the .5mg in half, and take one half in the morning and the other half at night. From there I want to slowly eliminate the nightly dose, and be on .25mg for the day, stay there for a month and then stop altogether.

Any thoughts? The only concern I have from completely giving up clonazepam is that while there was some bad, there was some good. Good in the sense that it really did help my GAD. The more I ween off, the more I start to notice my anxieties and slight paranoia about trivial things trickle back into my life. I do feel more creative, and feel as though my cognitive abilities are coming back. I am starting to feel like myself again, but myself was always a guy who sort of suffered from anxiety.",2,0

I’ve used something almost daily for 13 years.

Now that I’m sober(bar rarely some alcohol or weed, healthy usage) it seems all of these emotions and situations I’ve repressed comes back all at once in the form of depression and extreme anxiety, which are unhealthy ways of dealing with them. I’m still numb emotionally.

So my question is basically for you who can relate, and/or are completely done with withdrawals.

Does it change? Do I in time learn to feel emotion again? How does this process go and will I be able to take it? How did it happen for you, if at all?

I didn't know the risks, I just stopped taking them a few days after the first lockdown started.
Thus was the second worst experience of my life. I called an ambulance because after about 48 hours of vomiting every 5 minutes, I was seeing my stomach lining in the toilet. Sweat was dripping down my face and my heart was racing harder than I've ever felt it.
They stuck me in the COVID ward due to my vomit-induced coughing despite my protests, and stuck a few drips in me to mend my stomach lining and stop the vomiting. 
I was in there overnight, they gave me a very strong Diazepam and tested my blood. I was taking 4-6mg a day for about 2 months before I stopped. Upon coming out of hospital, I was terribly ill for the next 3 weeks ish. I stayed with my mum even though I'm a grown ass adult, because I couldn't eat or drink without puking still and was too weak to walk. I dropped to 100lbs and I felt like I wasnt real. I spoke gibberish to my family, I couldn't sleep and then when I did sleep I would wake up feeling as though the whole room was rocking. I would shake, my entire body would run cold and then hot. 
I don't really know why I'm writing this. I've been a member of this sub since the morning I left the hospital. It was here that I found out how stupid I had been and I guess I just want to say thanks. I'm a bit of a lurker but reading other people's stories here has really helped me. 
I've been clean just over 7 months now.
If anyone wants to talk or needs support, please do PM me. You're all brilliant people and I really appreciate having a space to vent. 
I wish you all luck and happiness.

I feel like activities that demand too much stimuli are making my brain feel like is overheating: my right temple begins to ache and I start to feel confused and unable to think straight. This wasn't rare in my taper.

Problem is that yesterday I was playing an online game with a friend and I forced things up. This ended with my head feeling bad with my right temple on fire and non stop thoughts flowing, I got confused, my bp oscilated and I wasn't able to meditate or fall asleep.

With this, when I finally slept, I woke up with my left hand numb and tingling for like 10minutes. When I stood up I felt my body all strange as if half of it was kinda numb and my body wasn't feeling totally mine. I was slow also. And the piercing feeling in my right temple was still there.

I think I’m developing an addiction to benzos. I’m diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder and was prescribed with clonazepam (Klonopin/rivotril) for my anxiety. For a long while I did fine without taking any so I kinda stockpiled them. But about a month ago I started needing them but the dosage didn’t work. I was supposed to take two maximum per day but I would take 4, 5. I told my psychiatrist it didn’t work so now I have lorazepam (Ativan), two per day max. And it’s really hard to not take more than two. Or to mix it with what klonopin I have left. I realized I mostly just want to feel numb because I’m starting to have psychotic symptoms again and I’m going through a rough patch in my life right now. I realize that if I do that I’ll eventually run out and be stuck in a corner where I can’t get more but need more. How do I keep myself from just taking more? Right now I’m thinking I’ll just do it this once and not do it again but I doubt it’ll just be a one time thing. I know if I do it my counsellor and psychiatrist will be extremely disappointed in me because he was reluctant to prescribe ativans and only did it because Xanax isn’t long acting enough and I didn’t want to go back on seroquel because I’m sick and tired of that drug. 

How do I keep myself from getting worse? It’s so hard and all I can think of during the day is the evening when I can take the two ativan pills. Like a reward for going through the day. Right now I just have a big urge of taking something be it klonopin or even some old seroquel because I want to feel numb. And I can’t wait for tonight when I will take my Ativan.",2,0

Are marijuana edibles an acceptable way to get through this period? As I don't smoke weed when I have them it knocks me right out. I know then that my new problem will be how to sleep without weed but surely that wouldn't be too hard to overcome once my GABA receptors have healed themselves.

I’ve been taking a .5mg dose daily for nearly that entire time and have taken 1mg on really bad days every so often. 

Well today I started my taper and I’m taking .25mg today and then .5mg tomorrow and alternating them this week. Next week it’s going to be .25mg daily and then the following week alternating .25mg and none at all.

I’m probably overreacting and I don’t mean to ask something that might be silly to those of you who have dealt with serious withdrawal, but I’m so worried I’m going to have a grand mal seizure or die or something. From your experiences, do you think this is a good tapering plan and should I be worried about seizures? My panic attacks have been so bad in the past that I’ve ended up on the side of the road with my arms curling in and unable to breath. I usually collapse in a median and kinda seize up, but apparently it’s due to hyperventilation. People have called 911 when they see me like this numerous times and I’m worried about something happening when I drive home from work.

What were yours, if any?","So... since 2013, I've always had Ativan on hand. I had some serious anxiety in the weeks building up to my wedding that completely crippled me – couldn't eat or sleep. Doctor prescribed me Ativan, and it worked wonders for what I was going through. Since then, I've always had a bottle of the 0.5 mg around, but I never abused them. I just took them on an 'as needed' basis, and probably went through around 30 of them per year.

Fast-forward to July, 2020. We have a 2-year old and a 4-year old. My wife and I decided it was time for me to get the snip, aka vasectomy. Needless to say I was a big baby about it, and a nervous wreck, so the morning of the procedure I decided to take a whopping 2.5 mg of Ativan. Damn did it calm the nerves lol, I hardly even remember the procedure. That week, as I'm lying on the couch recovering, I noticed my calf muscles twitching uncontrollably which obviously freaked me out. Not having any idea that it could have been from the large dose of Ativan that I took a few days prior, I decided to freak myself out even more by Googling shit about the muscle twitches and I became a hypochondriac pretty quickly. Thinking I had MS, Parkinson's, ALS, you name it. So what did I do? Decided to take more Ativan, which stopped the muscle twitches (since it's a muscle relaxant) and helped me to chill out and not fret over a condition that I most likely don't have.

But, on the nights that I didn't take Ativan, the anxiety, restlessness, insomnia took over. This was the first time I had ever experienced interdose withdrawals, but I didn't realize it was because of the benzos. I just thought my mind was obsessing over my muscle twitches as I was becoming more and more anxious. It's also really hard to sleep when your calf muscles are twitching. Then, we all went down to my in-laws 8 hours away from home, and I decided not to bring any Ativan, and I about lost my fucking mind. Panic attacks, no sleep, anxiety was through the roof. As soon as I got back the doctor put me on 1 mg/day. About 1 month in, I realized it's been the Ativan all along and I was such an idiot for not realizing this earlier on. My doctor was kind enough to put me on a valium taper after I did my research on how to safely withdraw from benzos.

So in 4 or so months, I basically went through 3 withdrawal periods – the first 2 withdrawals were sort of accidental, cold turkey'd, and I just thought I was losing my mind. The third was after my last dose of valium, which I rushed the taper much too soon. I feel like I've permanently wrecked my brain. I'm currently 1-1/2 months off benzos completely, but I developed some really fucked up obsessions. The first one was an earworm that I feared would never leave my mind. I literally had a song looping nonstop in my head for almost 2 months like a broken record. My mind couldn't tune it out – I thought it was gonna be like this forever. One day out of the blue, my mind fixated on a new obsession and the earworm pretty much vanished overnight. Although this new obsession may be even worse – I am now hyperconscious of my blinking. This has gone on for about 4 weeks now and has been very distracting/annoying. Zoloft has been helping me cope, but man, what a shitty, shitty past 5 months this has been. And in 2020 of all years. Really hoping I can get my brain back in balance. My mind became my worst enemy during these withdrawals, and I never wanna experience anything like this again. Threw away a huge stash of Ativan, never wanna touch a benzo again. Fuck 'em.

Just telling you my story, in case it helps anyone, and to see what other obsessions you've all had to deal with during benzo withdrawals/recovery? It's hard for me not to be anxious about what my mind will think of next, but I'm hoping it all begins to slow down and not fixate on stupid shit like songs and blinking. I've been eating well, exercising, drinking a ton of water, and 50 mg of Zoloft a day is keeping me stable. I'm also seeing a psychiatrist and reading the book Brain Lock. Hopefully the hardest part is over with and I can keep up with my job and be a great husband/father. I never thought a pill like this could do so much damage in so little time. My brain was molded into an obsessive monster pretty quickly.",6,0

The only reason he keeps giving me chances is because he's a recovering alcoholic and I went through the same thing with him over and over again with alcohol several years ago. So I suppose it would be somewhat hypocritical for him to walk out on me now that I'm struggling so badly.

Still, it kills me to see that defeated, sad, disappointed look  on his face, the guilt and shame I carry around until he knows what I did, and the dread I feel when I know I have to face him and admit that, once again, I failed him.

I'm in canada, Ottawa and I suppose the ER is always there if I am getting bad tremors (had terrible ones before)

Current withdrawl symptoms are muscle twitches. That's about it after coming down from 10mg to 5mg valium.

I was on 0.5mg Klonopin daily for about 6 weeks. I was prescribed them as I started taking an SSRI due to being suicidal. I have to say that the Klonopin really did help for that but I was wary about being on it and recently felt in a good place to stop. And so I started my taper. I cut down to 0.37 (3/4 pill) for about 5 days, then down to 0.25 (half pill) and I've been at this dose for about 5 days. I'm going to try weaning longer, as this feels too fast.

I've skimmed this sub and found many stories of people on these pills for years and having a really hard go getting off them. My heart goes out to you guys - I can't imagine going through that. I wish doctors were a lot more careful prescribing this stuff.

I've noticed an increase in my anxiety and I'm having trouble sleeping. I've heard those are pretty common withdrawal symptoms and mine seem to be mild. I wanted to ask, though, if anyone had bouts of acid reflux happen coming off these meds? I've never had heartburn in my life, and I finally know what it's like now after having it occur every day for the last 3 days. Anyone else experience this?",1,0

I went from 78kg(172lbs) to 66kg(145lbs) in around 2 months. I seemed to stabilize at that during my withdrawal free period. Now I’ve had a bad 1-2 weeks again and this morning I was 65kg(143lbs)

At 180cm(5’11) this is very low weight for a man, and I’m nearing the underweight category. I was always really skinny growing up, and I’m terrified of getting skinny again.

I’m not blaming them entirely but they took my in my peak and dragged my ass through the mud. Crippling anxiety before I tried them around 21-22. Now 26 and two months sober from Klonopin and Xanax and the same crippling anxiety is here, depressing life altering anxiety that has taken me in the last remaining however many years in the prime of my entire life, and wiped it’s ass with it.

It’s so bad I almost want to go back on Oxy. I’m really not at ease with my situation in life or this feeling. I’ve been exercising and that helps some but not nearly enough. I’m alone and don’t have it in me to open up the reddit app sometimes. All off of vyvanse as I can no longer take it comfortably because of the tachycardia.

Pills fucked up my life. No more pills for me. I overdid everything I took. Money was never an issue. Still isn’t but what’s that good for when you have nobody to share with. I don’t even want to take anything again. I stopped taking gaba. I wouldn’t take anything to sleep and let that naturally work out. About 2 weeks ago I started sleeping for like 4-5H and wake up and then sleep for a few more. This is the longest time asleep off of benzos or oxy I’ve got in my entire actual memory.

Kratom sucks and a week or two or 10/15G use gave me bad sweats for a while (otherwise pussy WD compared to oxy haha). Just ordered some Kava. Can someone tell me it’s gonna get better? Cause right now it just doesn’t seem realistic. Oh and you guessed it, my girlfriend of 5 fucking years just left me during benzo WDs. Don’t even wanna talk about that. 

Sobriety outright is frightening and so much to deal with. One you lose your crutch in life, it can overwhelm you so fast. SSRIs I will never take. I’ve been offered them so many times, even when I fucking make it crystal clear to start with I will not take them.

It was hell and it still sucks. But I'm getting better.,"I was on Clonazepam (Klonopin) 2mg/day for 3 years. Back when I was 28, I went to see a psychiatrist about my anxiety at work, he prescribed Clonazepam, and it seemed to help. I kept refilling that prescription for three years without giving it much thought.

Two months ago, I moved to a different state. I procrastinated finding a new psychiatrist to continue the prescriptions, and my pills ran out. But things were going well for me. I was no longer struggling with anxiety. I figured I didn't need to bother finding a new psychiatrist and could just stop taking the drugs altogether.

I had no idea what I was in for. The first two weeks off the drug were absolute hell. I didn't know anything about Benzo withdrawal at the time, and like an idiot I didn't even connect that stopping my medication was the reason I suddenly started feeling like absolute shit. I developed crippling physical symptoms... nausea and diarrhea, chills and sweats, limb numbness and face twitching, and staggering muscle pain. The physical symptoms alone would have been enough to keep me in bed most of the day, but the mental symptoms were worse... debilitating dizziness, complete inability to concentrate or think, and overwhelming fatigue and exhaustion. I started performing poorly at work. In just two weeks, I went from being a top contributor to worrying I'd be fired. I started feeling unbelievable anxiety every waking minute, and I started waking up multiple times a night with panic attacks. It seems insane now that I didn't realize what was happening at the time, but it genuinely took two weeks of abject suffering before I acknowledged the symptoms and recognized Benzo withdrawal as the cause.

I finally called a psychiatrist in my new state and explained what was happening. He prescribed a small amount of Sertraline as replacement medication for my anxiety. But he recommended against prescribing further Clonazepam. He said if I'd already made it through two weeks of quitting cold turkey, I should just see it out and stay off the drug entirely going forward.

Sure enough, the next two weeks were also miserable. I took those next two weeks off from work to eliminate stressors while I focused on recovering. That helped a bit. I'm genuinely not sure how I could have made it through those two weeks if I hadn't called off work. But wven with the time off from work, those next two weeks were unbearably painful physically and mentally. But... slowly, slowly, slowly... my symptoms started to improve. I no longer have debilitating chills and sweats, limb numbness, or muscle pain. I'm not curled up under the covers in agony like I was those first few weeks off the drug. I do still have constant nausea and intermittent diarrhea, and I haven't shaken that pervasive feeling of fatigue and exhaustion. But even these physical symptoms feel (at least a little) more manageable now. As for anxiety... I'm no longer waking up every hour of the night with full-blown panic attacks, although I still can't sleep past 4am before I wake up and my mind starts racing. Going back to work last week was so mentally and emotionally draining that I spent every evening lying on my sofa with the lights off listening to my head throb and my chest pound. Even this very moment, I feel dread course through my veins whenever I think about work. My job is now precarious after a month of low performance, which only causes more anxiety. I have no idea how I'm going to deliver on all the projects I'm behind on over the next month. It's exhausting and depressing to think about. But even though things are hard, and work is terrifying... I know I'm still much, much better than I was a few weeks back. The past month has been traumatic, but I'm optimistic I'll come out of this stronger once it's over.

If I'd known about Benzo withdrawal, would I have quit cold turkey? No, absolutely not. Stopping the medication cold turkey like I did was irresponsible and dangerous and caused myself to endure an inhumane amount of needless suffering. Please don't be like me. Talk to a doctor before stopping any medication.

Did my new psychiatrist make the right decision not to prescribe further Clonazepam when I sought help two weeks after quitting cold turkey? No, I don't think so. I understand he thought I was through the worst of it. But the next two weeks were still absolute hell. If I had to go back in time to that two-week mark, I'd push like hell to get back on my original 2mg/day prescription and instead work to slowly taper off over the next year.

But now that I'm 5 weeks off the drug...? Well, even though things suck right now, I know I've come a long way. And I strongly believe I'm getting better every day. So I'm seeing this cold turkey strategy through to end. I'm done with the absolute worst physical symptoms, and I'm hopeful the remaining physical symptoms will improve soon. The constant anxiety is still torture, but I'm researching therapy and plan to learn some CBT-based coping strategies. This past month has been undeniably awful, and frankly I expect the next two months won't offer much of a reprieve. But I'm making progress, and someday I'll be better. I know there's a light at the end of this tunnel. I'm going to get through this.

I started writing this tonight because I needed to share just how awful I'm feeling right now. But typing this up has been encouraging. I recognize how far I've come. If anyone's going through anything similar, know you're in my thoughts. I know how awful it is. You're suffering, and I'm sorry. But we can get through this, and things will get better.",2,0

I am almost giving up my taper and living with this shitty pills.

I was, from years ago, diagnosed with pure-O OCD, which means I basically deal with obsessions and intrusive thoughts with my compulsions being mental. I am currently at 100mg of zoloft which is considered under the ideal for a dosage for OCD.

Since my most recent cuts these days have been a living hell to the point I am even making my parents depressed. What happened today and this week made me decide that this was enough, I need another plan. My most recent cut was 0.4 to 0.3mg of V.

Basically, today I thought I was going to trigger something serious in my mind to the point of needing antipsychotics: my intrusive thoughts were nonstop and I wasn't even capable of meditating. Couldn't turn these thoughts off and I was stuck in my mind with so many thoughts and feeling so bad.

From this, I think I really need to treat my OCD before I do anything. That being said I am kinda paranoid about not having any opition with any med making things worse. I need more than ever to pick the most conservative option to feel better, and I need help with the options that I have:

* Increasing Zoloft from 100mg to 150mg;
* Take L-theanine with Inositol (from NOWfoods);
* Take magnesium glycinate;
* Take valerian;
* Take pregabalin;
* Use rescue doses or updose Valium.

I have all them with me from doctors that prescribed or stuff that I bought but got afraid to try. Now, I know that it's not optimal to use any of the options above and that they can make my recovery slower but things are really unbearable and I think I don't care about going optimal anymore.

 I realized recently I have been taking benzos too much. I was always told by Dr's that anything under 1mg daily won't cause trouble. 

For the last probably 3 years I had been taking .5-.75mg Xanax daily for anxiety, and the past few months I realized if I didn't take that dose I felt like crap. I was able to get some clonazepam and ive been trying to replace the Xanax with klonopin because I heard its easier to come of of.

My question is, having gone through withdrawl previously from heroin, painkillers, and long term high dose kratom, what should I be expecting if I stop taking it? Am I at risk for the severe effects like psychosis or seizures? Unfortunately I cannot afford inpatient treatment, and my GP doesnt understand benzos.

My last dose was 35 hours ago now, I don't feel like this is too bad but I know that withdrawals tend to kick in around the 48-72 hour mark. I've felt a bit more anxious but I'm not sure if that's just me worrying about WD's or if these are actual WD's. 

Couldn't sleep at all last night either so that probably plays a role too. Fell asleep around 10-11am and slept poorly until 3pm. Constantly waking up. 

I have some etizolam left, but not enough to taper. I'd run out before I'd be able to get more.

Not sure what to expect. I know benzos (or well, thienodiazepine in this case) are notorious for their withdrawals so I'm a bit worried. I've heard etizolam can be more forgiving? I keep telling myself it's only 17 days but I don't know. 

Is the general idea that you should always taper or is it fine to cold turkey it?",3,0

Sorry I had a look around on Google but couldn't find anything relevant.

Due to alcohol withdrawal over the last 5 days I have taken 30 or possibly 40 5mg tablets. Should I be worried about getting withdrawls?  Im not sure if it's one of those things you have to be taking for a long period of weeks / months in order to get withdrawals.

To say I feel good is an understatement. This is quite possibly the best week I've had in ages from an overall health and wellness aspect.  If I can get to this finish line then I know you can or your loved one can as well. 

I've never been more happy to be alive in my life than I am now. I'll be straight with everyone. I might of ended up in the hospital mid-July, because I lost it. Some unfortunate things transpired. What benzos had been doing to my mind and body were the ultimate reasons for this slow free fall into just sickness. A darkness I've never felt in my life had taken over.  I was positive I wanted to die. I was going to. I had a plan. I found some strength and go to this facility.  I purposely chose to detox on top of this psychotic episode I'm having. Great idea. Let me tell you.  Anyways, insurance so they have to release me on day 10. I was feeling ""ok"" at that time. Little did I know what was still in store for me. I guess sometimes the universe really wants to test people.

Once I walked out of the hospital, now 7 days post benzo, the world decided to up the ante.  I suspect the safe environment of the hospital must of helped things, because once I walked out those doors I sunk even further into the abyss. Full blown benzo withdrawals. I am literally losing my mind. The pain is unreal. I am going to die. I want to die. I feel like I'm dying. I even sadly beg my father to shoot me like a wounded dog because the overall level of pain was almost too much. This is literally unbearable. I always thought I was no stranger to pain, but I had never experienced this level of pain. This goes on for too long.

But. You know. 

I DID it and I am still here. I have never wanted to live life more than I want to now. The depression and anxiety that I was accustomed to while on Klonopin. Lifted. Gone. No more.

Update: I was exhausted on top of the other symptoms because my sleep schedule has been so out of whack... so I took a two hour nap this evening. I actually slept pretty good.

Sorry for the long post but there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

I know this is very dependant on the persons brain chemistry, weight and other factors etc but what would be a generally accpeted amount of times you could take primarily xanax and at what dose without developing WD.

For example around 8 months ago I came out of surgery from my Crohn's disease. I was in a lot of pain and found it hard to sleep. I had uni exams coming up so was taking xanax to fall asleep. I bought 25 pills rated at 2mg per bar (bootleg bars from darknet so dosage may not be fully accurate, however it is a trusted vendor). I would not take it every night usually spaced between 2-3 days each dose and just at night. After only two weeks I had about 4 pills left. So there were nights were i was taking up to 4 mg. Now after my surgery I only weighed 50kg which i think was a major factor in how hard these bars hit me. I would usually go staright to bed as i started to feel it so i think I wasnt really noticing how large of a dose it really was until one night I stayed up a bit longer, went to get some water and could hardly walk straight.

Any way i didnt think much of it and forgot to take any xanax for a while as the pain from surgery was minimal enough that I could sleep without it. After about 2 days I started to feel WD. started off with a buzzing in my head and I couldnt sleep until i started to even get tremours. I spent hours on hours and even paying money for online docotors to give me advice all of which said I couldn't be feeling withdrawal from 2 weeks of use. I decided to test it and took 0.25mg at night as I needed to sleep for my exam the next day and figured one more day of using just 0.25mg wont do much extra damage and at least I can deal with this after my exam. Sure enough all the symptoms went away. At that point I realised it was 100% WD. I decided to go to my doctor and explain the situation and luckily he didnt tell me that I couldnt be experiencing WD from just 2 weeks of use. He put me on a valium tapper. 4mg of valium every 4-6 hours as needed then 4mg every 8 hours as needed then stop (or something close to that). I started taking it every 4 hours for 3 times the first day and then one more 4 mg after 6 hours then nothing until like 5 am as I was at my sisters 21st. Each time i took the 4mg it would stop the hand tremours. It was bearable but unpleasant. Finally when I got home I took 10mg to go to sleep as I hadnt sleep much at all in past few days. I managed to sleep and felt much better. Didnt take anything the next day until at night i took 2mg to sleep. After that I had no more symptoms and never touched them again for 8 months. So really it only took me about 2 days to go back to normal.

Fast forward to now and I retried it thinking that the main reason i felt decent WD symptoms from only 2 weeks of use was due to my extremely low weight and fast metobalism. I bought 50 bars and ended up with about 20 left after a month and a bit, with the same procedure as before taking it every 2-3 days but at 4mg doses. One night I took 6mg and then within 2 days I couldnt sleep and felt that familiar head ach and rushing coming on. I then took 30mg of valium and it went away. After that I waited 10 days and felt minimal to no WD symptoms. Since 10 days is 5 half lifes for valium it can be a good guess that it is pretty much completely out of my system and I think there will be no problems.

Tl;DR:

Used xanax had decent WD symptoms. Took 2 days to recover. Retried it 8 months later and fixed the WD with one 30mg valium dose.

Now if i was to use xanax how often could I take it withought developing a dependance and at what dose. say recreationally of either 2mg or 4mg?

Cheers for anyhelp. I know this can be very subjective but I would like to get some ball park number

Btw I now weigh 66kg.",1,0

It's fascinating to me how you can feel so normal, but people can notice these differences in you.

And  when everyone else gives up on you, as as happened to me *NEVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF!!* Your whats going to get you through this and out the other side. And when you can't fight anymore lay down, rest, and get back up and fight again.  Keep going the best you can, hope is the gift you give yourself when times are not so bad, and you feel your making head way then along comes a wave and knocks you back down.  

But try to remember that hope and hang on to it like a single speck of light in the darkness and remember when that wave hits how many times you've been there before drowning once again, and felt like   giving up only to feel different again when you get a break even if its only for minutes or a few seconds that's still a good sign.  

And remember right now may be a fkn crap day but at any given second it can also change completely or at least become more bearable for a while this is how healing work. Peace love and healing to everyone QP9  ❤️ xxx

I’ve now been prescribed Valium for about 2yrs as needed. I can make a box of 50 5mg vals, last about 3months. I’m absolutely terrified of becoming dependent on this medication after reading some of the horrible stories of dependency and withdrawal from benzo medications. 

It’s important to know that I have an been heavily dependent on opiates after discovering the blissful world they created after an injury to my back about 5yrs ago, and now find myself on suboxone after a inpatient detox about a years ago. I’ve also had issues with lyrica, but never to the same degree as opiates. ( managed to keep my tolerance reasonably low compared to others on pregab and try to only take it 4 times a week. 

I use the Valium as needed and never more than 10mg ( mostly 5mg)or more than twice a week, sometimes less or even none, rarely more. 
So to cut a long story short, can you become dependent this way, or does it need to be daily,  at increased doses before full dependency occurs. I’m just confused about the whole long half-life side of it. 
I should mention that I’ve had scripts for temazapine also but still only took sparingly as with the Valium and it’s been a month or so since I finished the last of the script for them. 

I’ve also been recently put on dexamfetamine from a phyc to manage adhd but don’t think that would affect the GABA system.

I have almost posted a couple times recently here. I've honestly been needing all the outlets, support, etc. Not going to get into the details much here, about the abuse and abandonment from people who supposed to be my family, the homelessness I've experienced (thank God I have a home now, even if I'm not sure how long, I feel it will at least be through winter), etcetera. That's not even half of it. Not to mention 2018, 2016, or since I was 11, this has literally been the hardest year of my life, in every fucking way. 
Anywho, I'm a poly drug addict and am tapering myself off of klonopin (because doctors are audaciously incompetent), for the second time, but with everything going on, it's been even harder. I don't feel I have the emotional energy to research much, as I have a lot on my plate. I have a question, I just felt the need to preface it with a lil background vent lol. 

*Will taking klonopin twice a week, or so, fuck up my recovery?* I had to go from every 2 weeks, to once a week, due to lack of $$$ for Cannabis Concentrate. I remember reading that, typically, using a benzodiazepine twice a week will not create dependency. Would I be able to go ahead and dose like every 5 days or so? I am actually recovering, finally. It has been since May!!! Benzodiazepines are the absolute worst, and I am incredibly hypersensitive. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and cPTSD, etc. I'm just wondering if I've been pushing myself too hard, too quick. Even though I'm seemingly almost done with PAWS, could I dose a little more often, to avoid anymore severe and unnecessary panic attacks, mental breakdowns, and fits of irritability & rage?? IIRC, when I did this in 2016, taking it twice a week was fine??? I am really not sure, but my PAWS kicks in before the week mark and even though it's gotten so much better, I'm so done with my brain not functioning properly. I'm getting really serious about taking my life back and I don't want to waste any more time or suffer unnecessarily. 

I'm ridiculously insecure and critical of myself, so I hope my post is okay, and that the whole world doesn't exile me. Don't mind my babbling. I almost don't even want to post, but I'm done battling myself and I'm overcoming my damned insecurities.

I was a taking 1-3mg of Xanax for around 3 weeks and quit cold turkey around three weeks ago. I had short and painful acute withdrawal symptoms which have mostly passed but I now find myself unable to sleep at night.

Without going into too much detail, I am on a postgraduate research course which requires my brain to function. I am currently not sleeping and I cannot work. This is a huge problem and is leading me to become quite desperate.

I've occasionally been taking zopiclone to sleep on some critical nights, but afterwards the insomnia returns. I know this is well known, but on some nights I have desperately needed to sleep. Some nights, when I get very stressed I have also drunk alcohol and smoked marijuana to try and sleep.

I've bought some blue light filtering glasses, an eye mask and some melatonin. I also have some drowsy antihistamines. I now have the weekend ahead of me and no pressure to function, so I'm going to stay entirely drug-free to try and force my body to re-equilibrate.

What can I do and how long is this likely to last? This is maddening! Your tips and insight would be massively appreciated.",13,1

Had a benzo problem in the past. What should I do? Looking for support.,"Five years ago, I had a problem with Xanax. I don't remember a good 3 months of my life because my friends and I were all binging together during a super crazy time. I stopped after I got seriously hurt (they continued) and my addiction became more one to Adderall, which took years to heal from.

I was sober besides alcohol on weekends for a while, and Kratom to help me not go too hard with alcohol.

I'm prescribed Ativan for panic attacks and high blood pressure spikes/seizures (hasn't been diagnosed officially but acknowledged as that by my doctor over the phone and it definitely felt seizure-like) and have been in scary situations where I legit need them. But I've had a rough year (as we all have) and back in February there were times I'd take 6mg of my 1mg pills to pass out, and was residually ""barred out"" (I call it ""circled out"" because of the shape) the next day. On and off for a few months I'd repeat this behavior; it helped me write and I finished a novel that came out really well according to feedback. Being on Ativan helps unlock my inner conscious and release my inhibitions and I feel like I can only write while on it.

The past three months I've done the same thing: gone through my entire month's prescription (saving 1-2 for an emergency) within a week. This week I had some problems with it though: falling asleep almost immediately. Last night, while on 6mgs and a lot of Kratom, when I was half-asleep I had terrifying hallucinations where I thought that scary witch looking men were at my door, sinisteringly smiling and waving at me.

I really need help but I don't want to tell my psychiatrist this. The med has actually saved me during a super high blood pressure spike/seizure. Idk what to do. I haven't told any of my family or friends except for one I used to do drugs with. I feel so much shame. I want to be able to write without it. Why do I do this and how can I stop?",0,0

This summer I decided to taper because I started EMDR therapy for severe PTSD. It got rough when I went down to .25MG so I switched to Valium 2MG and I will jump from .25MG Valium in two weeks. I felt the change from Klonopin to Valium in a good way, even if only emotionally, because it felt like I was making progress. I'm going to pat myself on the back big time once I'm done - being able to say that I no longer take benzos after being on them for over 25 years is huge for me.

I've convinced my husband to taper but his doctor challenged switching to Valium because it ""stays in your system longer and is more addictive"". He literally just got off a tele-med visit with her and I heard everything she said. Of course it stays in your system longer because it has a much longer half life but I do not know if it's more addictive (seems subjective). Anyway, ""addiction"" isn't the issue here. No abuse is going on and he does understand the dependence issues so he just wants to get off of it. He does not understand tolerance and interdose withdrawal and it stresses him out when I try to explain it. His attitude is, let me follow my doctor's orders and try not to think about any withdrawal issues. 

So his doctor prescribed an abstinence taper over 7 weeks where he reduces his .25MG by one day (night) per week each week. This sounds potentially problematic and I don't know how he's going to avoid interdose withdrawal. However, I acknowledge everyone is different and this may totally work for him especially if he can stay in the right frame of mind so to speak. He didn't ask his doctor about interdose withdrawal but I am pushing him to do so (I really want to hear her answer).  

I'm interested to know if anyone has tried this kind of taper and what were your results. Thanks so much!",1,0

I used klonopin as needed for three years, I tapered for four months and I have been off since August. My symptoms are not as severe as most people I see post on here...but still. WTF. This is horrible. This is EASILY the hardest and worst thing that has ever happened to me in my whole damn life.   
I was never addicted, I took less than what I was prescribed. I was ignorant and just thought, well.. this pill makes the panic and anxiety end, why stop taking it? I did not know of it’s dark side.   
I hate withdrawal and its happening during the most stressful time of my life.   
I moved from Houston to Denver, I live away from family, I have to work, and then I’ll be moving out of state again in a few months. I have to be able to perform. I have no time to be house bound.   
I have never had social anxiety my entire life, I was just a recluse. Now I have social anxiety. I feel weird and uncomfortable around people. I think and Get anxiety about existential bull shit. Like, why are we all here? Why are all these people here? I feel like a weirdo amongst others. How will I be able to hold down a job, pay bills, live a happy life and function during this time?   
I am so close to finding another doctor and getting back on. I was fine for the three years I was on it and never abused it, craved it, or used it irresponsibly. It was just there for that JUST in case panic attack or anxiety. I am sick of withdrawals and klonopin 0.5-1mg was all I needed throughout those years.   
Why suffer for MONTHS upon MONTHS if I don’t have to? I originally joined This sub to see if others were going through what I was enduring and to educate myself on the matter, would I be a failure if I got back on? I mean, WTF, why is one fucking little pill that ends anxiety so fucking horrid to withdrawal from. It’s cruel. Two week withdrawal would be a fucking cake walk. But no, its several fucking months of hell. And to make matters worse, whenever you get windows you think you’re 100% again. I thought I was one of the Lucky ones, all to be hit with a massive shit wave. Fuck this shit. Crack, cocaine, weed, booze, heroin, etc., to my knowledge, is nowhere near severe as benzos Or as long. I know booze is a dangerous one though. I’ve never done any drugs. I’ve smoked weed for years and drank every now and then, but klonopin actually helped me. I wasn’t living in fear and it’s the only thing that stops a panic attack in its tracks.

I manage my anxiety well, so mainly took about 0.5mg per night of Ativan to help with the sleep maintenance insomnia associated with the depression or possibly the Lexapro start-up side effects.

I took 0.5mg pretty consistently, though over the course of 6 weeks would sometimes skip a day or two if I felt alright. Did one week at 1mg when the insomnia was especially bad, but quickly tapered back down to 0.5 for a week, then 0.25 for a couple days then finally came off it about 4 nights ago. Reason I started to taper was the Lexapro/intensive psychotherapy was working, so the depression was getting better and consequently the sleep as well. Had no issues going down to 0.25, and after going off the benzo slept really good the first 2 nights - thought I would be spared from withdrawal, since for a short-acting benzo I would have expected the withdrawal to kick in by then?

Well, shit happens and I haven't slept more than 2-3 hours the past 2 nights. My previous episodes of insomnia (while depressed) were always to do with sleep maintenance, never had any problems initiating / falling asleep. Last night I rolled around for 6 hours and it was awful.

In addition to this, I've also been a bit jittery in the day time, but I'm not having terrible anxiety or panic by any means. Am I starting to withdraw, or have I just been coincidentally insomniated the past 2 nights for reasons unknown (overthinking it?)?

I never experienced this before. After 3 weeks, I went to the ER where they gave me Ativan .50mg. They gave me 5 more pills and I took them over the next 2 weeks at night sometimes cutting them in half. I felt a bit better aside from head pressure that also started that same week. Once I ran out I went to the doctor and asked for a med for sleep and he gave me Ambien 5mg. It only helped a few days so I stopped that & got a few more Ativan pills and took 5 more over the next week. I also started lexapro around this time. 

I started feeling a burning sensation in my thighs and they were very restless at night with twitching and shaking. I felt like I was getting worse & still suffering a lot and couldn’t sleep so I saw a psychiatrist. She gave me klonopin which I have been taking the past 3 weeks at .50mg at night, I only take it 4 nights a week since I’m afraid of taking it daily. I felt a lot better once I started the Klonopin and I was finally able to sleep several nights.

This week I felt my sleep was improving without 
it so I haven’t taken it since Tuesday night and I only took it 3 nights last week. On Sunday I started feeling the tingling in my legs again and I was aware of my heart even though it was a normal pace. Now it’s Monday 5am and I could barely sleep. My legs feel that slight burning sensation and they feel restless again. Could it be that this is happening since the Klonopin is probably out of my system by now? I’m aware it has a long half life but I figured withdrawal symptoms would start sooner than 5-6 days out. 

I think I took a total of 11 Klonopin .50mg, 10 .50mg Ativan and 2 weeks of Ambien since mid-September. Pretty sure I felt the same way but worse when I took the Ativan every other day. My doctors keep saying it’s probably not related to the benzos since I took them at low doses for not that long. Im super petite and weigh only 87 pounds in my mid-20’s so maybe they’re not low doses for me. I’m scared and don’t want to take klonopin again later tonight.

The first month was frankly pretty miserable, but I got over that.  However now, I'm currently definitely a pretty sudden wave of symptoms.  

There was a period of relative peace and now I'm having occasional but intense and sudden sweats, anxiety, panic, visual snow, tinnitus which at times was fairly overwhelming (just after I took a shower about an hour ago, it was very present and pulsating and it's still going like a constant high pitch/white noise in the background), everything feels bright, colors are extremely saturated, my head hurts, I'm getting shakes, random pains, spasms, twitches, tingles, dizziness, I can't think straight for shit, I feel this sensation of derealization, and the list of annoying shit goes on and on and on.  I'm getting more and more worried about how long this will go on and looking for new things that can help cope.

I've gotten back into exercising recently, I'm eating healthy, and started meditating.  I'm also experimenting with things like cbd, a leftover gabapentin and clonidine script, magnolia bark extract, bacailein, kava kava, valerian root, etc and all of these things either don't help at all or don't reliably work: eg gabapentin sometimes helps with insomnia, but anxiety, paranoia and panic will usually power right through it like nothing, valerian makes me more depressed and dizzy if anything, cbd frankly only does so much for my anxiety, etc.  I'm really wondering what you guys found helped you.  I'm at a point where I'm willing to try anything.  It would be nice to have something (non-benzodiazepine) in my arsenal I can reliably use and I'm simply asking you all for what you guys use for your symptoms.  Any recommendations are welcome.

Before this I was given Ambien and Ativan but those didn’t help as much. I also took hydroxizine. The Ambien only worked for 3 days and the Ativan was too short acting. The hydroxizine barely helped too, I’ve been on lexapro for about 5 weeks now and most of my anxiety is now gone. I’m still having issues with insomnia though that started with the severe anxiety and panic that I got hit with in late August. I’ve had severe insomnia since. There was one week a few weeks ago where I only slept 10 hours in an entire week. I take 7mgs of melatonin every night and sometimes have chamomile tea. It seems like the only thing that can help me sleep is the klonopin. I have a routine and go to bed at the same time every night but I’m still waking up multiple times and laying awake if I don’t take the Klonopin. I’m very scared of dependence and withdrawals so I want to start getting off of it. My physical anxiety is pretty much gone so I see no reason to take it if sleeping is now my only issue but I don’t know how to resolve it. The insomnia that I experienced a few weeks ago due to the anxiety was so severe that I think it’s just a lingering effect now and a habit. Or my body may still be kind of stuck in fight or flight mode a little bit and my mind is still preventing me from sleeping. Last night I jumped awake twice as soon as I was about to go back to sleep. What can I do, I’m afraid to keep taking the Klonopin?

Today I have had urges to drink though. I think its the lockdown kicking in and the fact I am trapped in a way physically to my room in my flatshare ( I don't get along with my flat mates ). 

The 2mg at night is enough to keep me in check because that's when I had bad anxiety and couldn't stop thinking in my head. 

But once I am done in 3 and a half weeks I don't know what I will do. 

1 Pint relaxes me and 2 keeps me in check. But 2 pints makes me think a 3rd will do me good and once  I am on the 3rd I won't stop till I am stumbling around and collapse on my bed. That's how it was every night almost before I used Xanax. 

But sleeping on xanax I wake up after very vivid dreams that are not nightmares rather just too real feeling. And for the first half hour after waking my anxiety is very intense like I am afraid to get out of bed. 

I am going to try a new coping mechanism of whenever I feel overwhelmed to do push ups. I can only do 7 in a row which is rather embarrassing because I am not even fat just have a medium beer belly that won't disappear.

M23 here. Long story short, I abruptly curbed a benzodiazepine addiction a few months ago, and have since realised that I’d been ever so cleverly self-medicating for depression. I’ve been prescribed SSRIs in the past, but they’ve never really agreed with me. Unprescribed Diazepam agreed with me a little TOO much.

I’ve since been \*mostly\* clean, but still have pretty bad cravings which make that difficult. My GP has just prescribed me the antidepressant Mirtazapine (15mg), and I wanted to talk about it in relation to addiction. Whilst technically I'm prescribed Mirtazapine for depression, it also seems to have some complimentary effects for benzo recovery too.

I’ve struggled with sleep since stopping using, and as luck would have it Mirtazapine is pretty sedating - by taking it in the evening it pretty much zonks me out as my head hits the pillow, and definitely has some initial calming effects which are not TOO dissimilar from a very small dose \[compared to your tolerance\] of Diazepam, etc.

From initial research, it looks like Mirtazapine is known to be used to help treat a range of addictions, and not just as an antidepressant. I’ve only been on 15mg Mirtazapine for just over a week, and sleep is the main benefit I’ve found so far, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience/knowledge of Mirtazapine as an aid in benzo recovery that they could share?

fast forward to the past month or so... triggers and benzo use (lowering my inhibition) caused me to relapse to IV drug use (coke, mdma, meth,  various pills, I couldn’t find any opiates luckily).

I’ve also been taking various pills (ambien, vicodin, tramadol) and drinking always in excess.

I understand that I’m an addict. I also understand that I have things inside me that need to be found and held and eventually healed before I can stop using these substances to numb the constant pain and shame I experience.

can anyone relate to my experience or provide some guidance? I have access to detox/inpatient (which does not provide dual diagnosis) and i’m scared to go because it’s typically 3-5 days for the detox and if they’re tapering me off benzos that’s way too fast.

I have a possible other opportunity for outpatient at a much better facility but I don’t know if it will keep me accountable enough.
I’ve been getting different advice from former addict friends, the internet, doctors, nurses, life coaches, therapists, harm reduction professionals and I’m just finding myself more upset and confused than ever.

pls help

I’ve always struggled with falling asleep (I can usually stay asleep and if I wake up even fall back asleep). I blame a medical condition I have called Dysautonomia and I blame my previous career of being in the medical field and being on call for ten years. Things got extremely dark for awhile though and after months of 2-3 hour nights of sleep after being awake 24 hours or longer, I became suicidal because I lost all hope that I would ever sleep normal and just couldn’t function. I literally still have to cancel plans sometimes and it’s affected my ability to hold down a job even though I was with my old company ten years. I’ve been through some vigorous CBT-I and have a very set routine that literally has a four hour prep prior to sleep. I was prescribed 0.75mg of Xanax because after a laundry list of medication this is ALL that worked and I genuinely feel if that hadn’t of happened I would have seriously lost it. I thought I understood what it meant to lose hope but not sleeping makes you emotionally all over the place. This was working for a bit, but of course tolerance built up. Sometimes I’m able to start tapering off (I’ve gotten as far down to 0.37mg) and then I have nights like last night where I will do everything right (I’ve even changed my diet immensely and am taking every vitamin/supplement) and I can’t sleep. I always start with 0.50mg and then if 2 hours pass, I’ll take the 0.25mg which is my prescribed dose at 0.75mg. These last few weeks though (I would say 1-2 times a week I get so desperate when it’s 3am-5am (I make myself get up by 8 usually; rarely 9) and I will take anywhere from 0.25mg-0.75mg additionally because I’m so friggin exhausted but can’t fall asleep. I realize I have ptsd with sleep and set up a therapy appointment two weeks ago (can’t get in until the 11th however). The weird thing though is I genuinely can have zero anxiety and still not sleep.

I need help figuring out how to keep my meds away from myself and stick to the prescribed amount and start to taper off slowly because I know it’s coming (psychiatrist doesn’t want Xanax to be a long term thing). I live alone and don’t live in the best neighborhood. I’m fearful if I put it in the car my pills will get stolen and I’ll be really screwed because I already suffer from seizures. I tried keeping it downstairs figuring I’d be to lazy to go get it but nope, I walk down there and pop another pill. If it weren’t for sleep I won’t even need these, but sleep is a necessity to function. Even on meds my average is 6 hours. I’ve seen sleep doctors and they were just interested if I had sleep apnea so they were no help.

Today is a day where I only slept 3 hours the previous night and I am struggling bad; had to cancel plans.",2,0

I've been doing exceptionally well on my taper off Valium. I started at 10 mg a little less than two months ago and got all the way down to 2 mg with very little discomfort. I was surprised at how easy it was. However, in the past 36 hours or so, I've had an incredibly annoying pressure in my ears. I wouldn't exactly call it ""ringing"" but more like pressure or feeling of ""fullness"" you'd get when you have an ear infection. I thought it might be allergies and took some allergy medication but that did little to nothing to alleviate it. It's extremely weird feeling. I had been very disciplined until this point in the taper, writing, working, exercising, cooking well -- but this pressure in my ear has impacted everything, from my appetite to motivation to increased irritability. I should emphasize that the bizarre sensation in my ears was preceded by a super itchy nose so it's still possible that this is allergies, however it seems much more powerful. I also made the mistake of drinking coffee for the past 2 days -- I hadn't drank any for the duration of the taper and was fine -- so I wonder if maybe I should cut the coffee out and see if that helps? This ear situation really reminds me of ear issues I've had in the past when I was sick, when my ears were so plugged up that I almost had no sense of balance?

Also, I've been extremely diligent about keeping to the taper all the way down to 2 mg of Valium from 10. However, since this ""clogged"" feeling in the ears, coupled with external stressors -- the impending election plus the announcement of a new 5-month covid lockdown in my country, and commiserate shopping madness, plus a very heavy period (I have endometriosis), I have had to take an ""emergency"" pill two days in a row, so back up to 4 mg per day. I'm very determined to get through this, and quit alcohol, cigarettes, and (until yesterday) coffee to withdraw as best as I can. Since I've taken these additional two pills, do I have to go back to the beginning of the taper at 10 mg and start again? Or can I start at 4 mg and then work my way down from that again? I don't mind backing up a little -- the election and new lockdown are obviously stressful things -- but I don't want to start all over again.

&#x200B;

Let me know if you have any input about ringing/pressure in the ears, if it lasted and what you did about it, and if you think taking an emergency pill twice means I have to start all over again. To recap, I've had a suprisingly easy time until now, and have felt quite good during the taper from 10 mg to 2. Thank you and bless you on your journey!",1,4

I'm currently in on the 7th day going cold turkey off Clonazepam. I was on 1mg for 14 months. I flushed all my Clonazepam down the toilet last Monday because I think it's destroying my memory. I don't see the point of being alive if I can't remember any of it.

I felt like the withdraw started the very first day I missed a dose, last Tuesday. I was intensely anxious, very hard to think about anything other than dying.

Around day 4 I started to feel insanely dissociated, like I had taken a step out of my head and was just watching a movie. The ground doesn't feel real below my feet, and I feel like I'm looking at someone else's hands when I look at my hands.

The world has started spinning around me a lot too, like a constant vertigo. Often I have to lie down because it feels really weird walking around. I'm also shaking a bit.

I've taken last week and this week off work, to try and get myself together. I work on the computer but I literally cannot look at a computer screen right now for more than a few minutes at a time.

I've avoided all caffeine and I've been forcing myself to eat 3 healthy meals a day, just vegetables and seafood, as well as plenty of water.

Mentally I've been practicing meditation using the ""Waking Up"" meditation app. There's a 28 day course which I am doing, and each daily meditation goes for 10 minutes. I perform each meditation 3 times per day, plus an additional meditation session whenever the anxiety starts to turn into blind panic and impending doom

Apart from that I'm reading books on CBT, basically trying to perform therapy on myself to keep myself sane.

When I'm not meditating or reading CBT books I'm mostly trying to distract my mind, switching between hugging my children while watching TV, and playing video games.

Honestly, I'm in mental hell right now, this post probably comes across way more sane than I feel. I feel like I'm fighting a mental war against literal insanity, desperately using meditation and distraction and self-therapy to try and fight back this wave of blind panic and physical distress.

After reading this sub I see now that cold turkey is not recommended, but I have not had a seizure during this 7 days.

I would really appreciate if anyone could answer the following questions for me:

&#x200B;

1. Am I unlikely to have a seizure since I have already survived 7 days without one?
2. How much longer do the really intense parts of this withdrawal usually last? I read that day 4-7 is the worst with Clonazepam so if I can hold out for 14 days do you think there will be some mental improvement?
3. Is there anything else I can do to reduce my suffering?

However I was out at the pub and some guy started a fight with my mate so I tried to break it up but I got slapped in the ear in the process which absolutely skyrocketed my tinnitus so I freaked out and took 4mg of Clonazepam to calm it down as I had a huge exam which I needed to be focused for the next day. 

I didn't take any further doses and its been two days now and I can feel some really intense symptoms coming on. Should I just do another taper or should I just ride it out.
