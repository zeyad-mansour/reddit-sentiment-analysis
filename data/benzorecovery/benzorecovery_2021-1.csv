I just can’t cope with the guilt.
I was a daily user of street Xanax, up to 4 bars.
I’ve been mainly abstinent from them since June 2019, but I’ve had a few periods since where I’ve used illicit diazepam. 
I have flashbacks from the withdrawal. I just cannot live with myself like this, it hurts too much. 
I can’t get therapy at the moment. 

Benzo’s brought me relief and I felt invincible. 

I’m sorry that this is so disorganised.

I found you all when I was trying to find something that could help with withdrawals. I want to share something that is helping me so much so maybe it can help you too. I have been on Klonopin for 14 years for severe panic attacks. I only took it as needed but did require at least 1 pill a day to avoid withdrawal symptoms. On bad anxiety days I would take up to 3. 
A few months ago I discovered Delta 8 THC was legal in all 50 states. This is something I had wanted to try when I had heard about it. I have never been able to tolerate traditional THC due to it causing anxiety for me. Anyways, I found a local CBD store that carried it and picked up a variety of products. I went home a researched all of them before trying anything. The 1st night I tried Comfortably Numb oil by 3chi. I didn’t know what to expect so I only took a 1/4 dropper of the 500 mg. It did not get me high but I did fall asleep much easier than usual. The next night I tried 1/2 and did produce a slight high but I was very relaxed and slept great. So, I decided the next night to skip my klonopin and only use the oil. I generally cannot sleep at all if I do not take at least 1. I slept great that night and felt great the next day. So, I decided to try to do 1/4 dropper during the day to see if I felt ok. I went the entire day feeling great. This was over the weekend so Monday I had to go to work and went back to my normal Klonopin dosage because I didn’t want to screw myself up.
2 weeks ago my Dr informed me that he was no longer refilling or prescribing controlled substances. He prescribed Atarax. I have yet to try it. Comfortably Numb is a combination of CBN and Delta 8 THC. So, I did a lot of research on CBN and ordered a bottle of CBN oil from the 3chi website. CBN is the game changer for me!!!  This is the only thing I have ever used that has controlled my anxiety just as well as Klonopin. Maybe even better. I tapered down to 1/8 of a pill and have not had anything for 3 days and I feel fine. I never in my life thought this would be possible. I normally would have panicked and found a new Dr. Now, I don’t care because I know I don’t need it and I have an alternative that I can control without my Dr. 
Right now I’m using Comfortably Numb gummies or vape in the evening for sleep and I use CBN oil during the day. 
I wanted to share with you all in hopes that it may help some of you. I know how horrible the withdrawals are and for me this is working!!!!

(currently tapering off Xanax prescription after 9/10yrs),"I was prescribed Xanax XR 1MG about 9/10yrs ago, I was 16 or 17. It started off as an additive measure to help with panic attacks, but I had multiple daily so I began taking it every day. It did help. But I was suicidal and also still a child so I wasn’t capable of understanding how this medication would affect me long term. I got fucked over. I just turned 26 last sunday and I’m losing my parents’ health insurance this upcoming sunday.

My psychiatrist keeps telling me that X should be treated as a bandaid treatment and not as a long term medication (as if I haven’t heard that before), and so she is trying to treat this taper off differently than my other medications. She keeps trying to advise me to only take it as needed. As a disclaimer, I actually really like this psychiatrist and I’m sad that I can’t continue see her. But it is clear that she doesn’t understand this drug. It took some push back and suggestions to find what *seems* like a safe taper.

None of that truly matters though because sunday is my last appointment with her, and then I’m on my own. To sit in withdrawal hell by myself. I don’t have a lot of money and I don’t have my license. I downloaded Good Rx to prep for my new life, which will be scouring for the cheapest place to buy medication. With no license in the suburbs, in the middle of the winter.

My partner just broke their arm and can’t drive for at least 6 weeks. They’re in a lot of pain so I’ve been trying to tend to their needs and not complain about my symptoms. They’re very supportive and will listen even if they’re in a lot of pain. But I have a phobia of vomit and am constantly exhausted. I have severe anxiety and this taper is throwing it back in my face. I’m terrified. I’m angry. I want to call up my first psychiatrist who prescribed me X in the first place and tell him that he fucked me over, but apparently he’s fucking dying. I keep sleeping through work. I wake up and feel like I’m on a deserted island in the sky. I feel like I’m floating further and further away from my body. And this sucks. And I want my body back.

Thank you for letting me vent. And if you read this far, thank you for listening.

I’ve been on SSRIs before and every time, the start up is brutal. This Klonopin taper already has me borderline psychotic, suicidal, has killed my will to live and even eat, not to mention the nausea which is driving me insane. All of that would be made worse if I start Prozac, atleast I think.

I’ve gone through times where I’ve had to take 2 of those to go down at night, the occasional during the day, and I used to always take them after partying. 

Within the last few years, I stopped drinking completely for like a year. Quit an entire group of friends and resultantly quit doing cocaine. 

I’ve worked on changing my life. I feel good about my progress. I practice meditation, mindfulness, went through yoga teacher training, and I use psilocybin mushrooms every few months to reset, and I am also dabbling with microdosing in between. I feel really good about these things. 

Back in the fall, I got in my head about having to take xanax daily and wished that I were different. I tried to go a few days without it, pretty sure I had a small seizure, and had felt dissociative earlier that day. It was fucking scary. 

I’ve been seeing the same pill-mill doctor  
this entire time and never once have I heard the word SEIZURE mentioned to me. 

So, my wife helped me with my first month of pills. We shaved off 1/10 of the pill, weighed it on a scale for accuracy. The plan is to take another tenth off every month until they are gone. 

My fear is that raising alarm to my prescribing doctor will cause them to quickly withdraw my prescription. I don’t want to take this risk. 

So what am I left to do? Just keep on telling them at my “med checks” every 3 months that everything is fine, until one day i’m like SURPRISE!! I quit on my own, using a slow taper schedule. 

They also prescribe me lexapro which I have never taken. They think I take this but I never have, I’ll be honest in that I just wanted xanax in the beginning for dentist appointments and gynecologist appointments, flying on airplanes and it just kinda worked... for a while. 

I think i might always need to have a few xanax on hand for those sorts of events and emergencies.

There are 7 billion of us in our own reality and we sort of naturally project our own realities onto what other people feel as it's our only reference point?

&#x200B;

What I mean by this is... when you've got every W/D symptom in the book including the weird perceptual stuff like hallucinations and derealization and you feel completely cognitively absent and disoriented... there is literally no way to meaningfully explain this to a person who is healthy. Our entire capacity for understanding another person's discomfort is relative to what we have experienced ourselves - and that even goes for people like doctors.

I don't know... it's just weird sometimes when you have a ""window"" or a good day and it kinda hits you that even if someone loves you you will only be able to communicate what you're going through to them so much. That people who are doing well don't really care for people like us being like 'I'm so ill' and probably underestimate what it's like... Anyone else get this weird feeling? Like just in general the entire field of psychiatry and psychiatric medicine is really weird as there will always be a disconnect between any two individuals - doctor and patient. and etc

Beyond that when we feel better ourselves we almost kinda don't exactly ""remember"" how bad we felt before - we just remember what we THOUGHT while we were feeling bad and go by the memory of how we reacted rather than fully being able to relive the physical sensation of it.

It wasn't all that bad at first, but by the time I reached 1.5mg, it became too much for me ( vertigo, hyper-sensitivity to loud noises, strong anxiety, muscle twitches/spasms, agoraphobia).

I contacted my prescriber and asked to temporarily halt going down any further, in fact I was only on 1.5mg for three days, now I'm back on 2mg a day, and have been planning to remain here for a while. I made this decision due to some recent stressful events, not just the difficulty of the taper.

I'd like to begin going back down to 1.5mg again once February starts.

My prescriber is becoming more flexible, I could go down by 0.5mg a month if I wanted, but quite frankly I want to be off of this garbage as quick as safely possible. I've been on it for about 15 years, and at this point it does more harm than good. I have trouble remembering much of anything and my general cognition is terrible, I act like a zombie, and I can easily become aggressive/angry which has resulted in some ruined relationships. I'm not sure if this is a possible side effect of benzodiazepine usage, but I also find I don't always recognize people (but being near-sighted doesn't help either).

I could really use some advice coming down on a rapid taper like this. Are there any additional vitamins and supplements worth taking?

I've been taking Magnesium L-Threonate daily which seems to be helping. I also bought the following but haven't been taking them regularly because I feel like I need input from others as to their effectiveness: Black Seed Oil, N-Acetyl-Cysteine, L-Theanine. I'd ask my prescriber about them but he literally knows nothing about supplements and legitimately seems to believe that anything that isn't a prescription medication is a placebo...

Thanks for any help/advice.

She recently moved to the same city as my husband and I and it's been very painful watch her spiral out of control especially the past 2 months. She takes a lot of different medications to help with side effects which are caused by the chronic use of Xanax. She has dealt with severe muscle pain, insomnia, appetite changes due to gastro issues, headaches, unsteady on her feet, agoraphobia, and many more. She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia due to the muscle pain she experiences but I think it all has to do with the Xanax but I'm not a doctor. She has finally realized she needs to detox after a medical scare. She hasn't really left her house besides doctor's appointments in 2-3 years. She called us last night complaining that the facility took away of course the benzos but also her hydrocodone she takes for her pain. She is supposed to get evaluated by the medical doctor today and he will decide if she's allowed to keep the hydrocodone. I'm sure that is protocol but wanted to find out what to expect at a detox center. She is also complaining about having to be kept out of her room the majority of the day but we told her that all treatment centers make you do group and individual therapy sessions and you can't just lay in bed all day like she wants to.

I’ve heard benzo withdrawal is really bad but I’m not sure if I’m taking a high enough dose to be worried since I know there are some people who actually take really high amounts and my dose doesn’t seem like that much in comparison. I still feel like I’m dependent on it though.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74920005}"

I ordered clonazolam on the 9th and the 19th of this month and I really can’t remember when I ordered the first bottle but I hadn’t when I started kicking opiates in late December. They sure helped the kick but after the second bottle ran out i started feeling more anxious. I wasn’t sure if it was just still withdrawal or PAWS from the opiates but I was just a ball of nerves fir the longest time.

So, anyway, third shipment comes late and because if the long holiday it didn’t come until Tuesday and i really just binged on it. I really enjoy the time speeding up aspect of benzos, especially when kicking and especially because I had a small relapse with the opiates in between. 

So, anyway this bottle is late as fuck and I’m just fucking obsessing over it, being pissed off. It was probably a blessing as it gave me a break. I don’t Olán to order any more of it. I’ve never had a benzo problem but god damn this stuff is actually euphoric.

In any case, how bad will my rebound anxiety be? And any remedies/supplements to help me out that are tried and true?

I have noticed some things have gotten better, at first it was basically unbearable. I can handle social interactions much better now, music is no longer outright unpleasant, I'm a little better at following a TV show or movie I don't really have trouble sleeping, my tremors seem to be reducing... there is a lot of stuff I try and remind myself isn't as bad as it was three months ago.

But what I'm still having a lot of trouble with is the subjective perception type stuff that is very hard to describe. I would call it derealization - I basically feel like there is a fuzzy screen between me and reality. My vision is still very blurry and I still have tinnitus which doesn't help but I simply can't shake the nagging feeling that I seem to have lost my spatial awareness and feeling of 'clarity'. The best way I would try and explain it is that I used to be a bit of a clean freak and would sort of enjoy organising the space I live in - now I look around my home and kinda just have a vague feeling of confusion. Things like laundry and dishes and grocery shopping are still confusing. Overall I just want to get that sort of enjoyment out of being alive and engaging with life. Things that used to give me a nice feeling like playing video games, driving my car, choosing my clothes and stuff just don't feel like they matter any more. I know that might sound a little dumb, it really is hard to explain.

Sorry this is long winded, I just was hoping to find out if anyone kinda understands what I'm getting at and whether they found this got better for them gradually.

Anyway a few months after I relapsed hard and went on a binge for around 4 months taking up to 3x2mg a day. I tried ct back in January and I lasted 12 days after that the muscle aches/headaches/insomnia/ anxiety/ etc. On the 13th day I started shaking but it wasn’t like before it was just kinda like my body was twitching on its own, I thought it would only last a while but it seemed to get worse I started passing out every time I stood up (didn’t fully pass out more like I was about to but every time I managed to get back to my bed and lay down.) I’ve literally stayed in bed almost everyday except when I work because the wds are that bad, anyway on the 13th day I said fuckit I kept a stash of xans in case I had a seizure or I decided it was too much, popped a bar and all my symptoms didn’t go away in a hr but the next day I woke up feeling normal again, I’ve been taking a bar a day but I don’t want to depend on xans. I hate forgetting shit all the time, the only reason I’m asking you guys for a simpler way of quitting without withdrawals this bad is because I work retail and I’m a stocker, I can deal with most of the wd symptoms at work but Tylenol does jack for the muscle aches/cramps so at work I’m sore the only thing I found that worked was oxycodone but that’s not easy to get without a prescription and I don’t want to become dependent on another medication. 

(Before you guys bash me for abusing Xanax without informing myself please know that these were actually prescribed to me by a doctor the issue is this was in Mexico, my family doesn’t have insurance and it’s cheaper to get treatment in Mexico anyway it was originally a .5 prescription for insomnia/anxiety. I was never told the dangers of Xanax dependency, I honestly thought it was just like taking ibuprofen so after seeing how much they helped with my anxiety I would just over take them since my tolerance built up. After awhile I got my doctor up my prescription to 30ct 2mg/month and eventually 90ct/month. Anyway when I decided to quit I told him my reasons and concerns he told me it was safe to quit and he said “we’ll find something else” so I no longer have a prescription. When I started having wds I tried contacting my doctor but he’s apparently on leave for like a month, he runs a small clinic and is a general physician in Mexico xanax isn’t as controlled in the us so most doctors can write it. The issue is when I call his office there’s just a voicemail saying he’s on leave but to leave a message and he’ll get back to you as soon as he can. I haven’t been able to contact him and I don’t know what to do, it was after I started having wds that I looked into quitting and saw how dangerous it was, I can deal with most wds but I need to somehow decrease how bad they are so I can work because I have bills to pay.)",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6525238}"

This may get backlash because it’s tough to hear and I’m not saying this is 100% fix for everyone because medication does have its place. 

However, we’re a bunch of broken brains that are scared of the future and need a fix NOW

Hear me out. We’ve got to stop relying on the quick fix. We’ve learned that the “quick fix” put us in the situation we’re currently in.... and that’s broken 

Benzos were the ultimate quick fix and we paid the price. How many of us truly gave it our absolute best? meaning months and months of clean eating, exercise, meditation, no toxic relationships, and we’re 1000% true to who and what we wanted out of life? 

Chances are that many of us haven’t tried that. Hell I’m 29 and just now learning these things after my jump in August

2 years ago I went through horrid benzo withdrawal for months on end, but finally got over it. To my great regret, I had a really severe panic attack and took some flubromazolam a few weeks ago. I won't go into detail, but the attack was so bad, I kept getting recurrences of it.  I did take benzos (mostly etizolam) a few more times in the following days to try to cope.  I did take them 3 days in a row once right after the big attack, but other than that, I did not take them any consecutive days and usually 2 or more days in between.  And I've kept the doses low.  But that wasn't enough caution to save me from having some withdrawl issues on the off-days, and every day now, since I stopped doing benzos at all.  I can't believe I'm back dealing with this shit again.  

Thankfully, the physical stuff isn't bad at all, I'm not a twitching, seizing mess like I was 2 years ago.  But the depression, anhedonia, and anxiety are still bad.  My biggest concern is sleep though.  

My doctor prescribed me zolpidem (aka ambien) because I'm not getting any sleep.  The zolpidem doesn't even work for me and I know it's also a gaba drug cross tolerant with benzos so I try not to take it either.  I'm taking CBD, l-theanine, magnesium citrate, black seed oil, and getting tons of exercise.  Even trying to do all the good sleep hygiene stuff.  But I still can't sleep.  I often will feel normal and sleepy at bedtime, start to drift off, then suddenly rise back out of it, totally awake and tense, muscles all tight and then end up not being able to sleep at all.  When I'm lucky, I may drift back off hours later, but wake up again within an hour of losing consciousness.  This is exactly what happened back when I was in PAWS after quitting a couple years ago. I nearly lost my mind from lack of sleep. 

I can't take the thought of not sleeping again for months like that.  Especially not with the current state of my life that I won't get into.  Keeping the anxiety at bay is a constant battle.  I really feel like I need some kind of chemical help here.  I know the general consensus will be to just stop and tough it out, but my mental health right now is such that I honestly think ""toughing it out"" would be... dangerous, considering the intensity of my s. ideation even before this relapse.

So I'm thinking I will ask my doc for a gabapentin script on Tuesday.  I know gabapentin is also (obviously) a gaba drug, but it seems safer and easier to taper than say, zolpidem.  And if I need to be on it long term, then maybe I just need to accept that.  It would be better to be on that long term than on an actual benzo.  Has anyone here had any luck with taking gabapentin for a while to help, then easing off of it?  Or taking it long term in leui of benzos?  

(I also have phenibut, and it helped a lot the one time I took it during this recent ordeal, even cured the mood instability.  But I treat it the same as I would a benzo - to be avoided unless absolutely necessary).

Sorry this got so long.  I'm in a bad headspace and feeling very alone, and I tend to go into way too much detail when I get like that.

--

TL;DR:  I'm having really bad unrelenting insomnia from a small relapse after 2 years off benzos.  I've been through this before and can't take it again.  I'm considering asking my doctor for gabapentin and want to know if others have experience with that, or advice, or just plain commiseration.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76429665}"

I'm wondering if I can get some advice on my best friend and his benzo addiction.

I've worked with him for over 7 years and have been in business together for around 4 of them.

I've always thought he was a bit strange, but it's come to light he has been addicted to benzos for around 3 years.

I noticed a big difference in him during the summer, both physically and mentally.

His motivation, ambition and work ethic had been slowly disappearing.

Before Christmas it got bad but I thought that it was down to stress given the time of year.

We both visited our family over Christmas for a few days so were away from each other during the festive period.

After Christmas, the next time we would see each other would be ahead of a really important meeting which he was supposed to prepare a presentation for.

On the eve of the meeting I received a number of messages that were all incorrectly spelt and made little sense but they did include promises to have the presentation complete by the morning.

This would be the biggest meeting of our careers and come the morning I had not heard from him nor had I received the presentation.

I had to call him around 50 times before he answered to which he said he couldn't even start the presentation because he couldn't focus.

This guy was always so good at putting together emails and presentations and this excuse just didn't make sense to me.

I knew straight away this was drug related.

I ended up compiling the presentation in an hour and delivered it by myself.

After the presentation issue I was 100% certain he was under the influence of some form of drug.

The real wake up call was when I next saw him (now please note I had not seen him since before Christmas) and he looked and sounded like a completely different person to who I saw before Christmas.

At 6 foot tall he must now be around 8 stone, slurs his words and genuinely struggles to write sentences.

He eventually came clean to me about his benzo addiction, and he claims he has been taking a mix of benzos for round 3 years and most recently he has been on xanax and lorazepam.

He has told me he takes around 6mg per day but he tells that many lies I don't know what to believe.

Since he told me the truth, I have made him tell his parents and his girlfriend which I'm glad he did.

I don't think his parents quite understand the seriousness because I'm seeing him deteriorate quickly both physically and mentally.

He has been coming into the office since, but offers no value. I feel almost like I am babysitting at times.

He has made the first step in calling a drug councillor who has said he'd help him taper.

Apart from this he hasn't done much to help himself, and has barely followed any advice given from the councillor.

He's ticking boxes but not following anything through. 

For an example I told him he needs to increase his food and water intake, so the next day he brings in loads of food and water but hasn't actually consumed anything.

He seems to think he can taper off the lorazepam within 4 weeks - and that's as far as his current supply will go - and he wants to avoid going to the gp .

I really don't know what to do here guys. Am I missing something? Is there anything I can do? What should I look out for? How much danger is he in? What should I expect the next few weeks to look like?",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44753352}"

Although the idea that animals feel emotions is something that neuroscience has carefully avoided since the days of B.F. Skinner and behaviorism, Ivan Pavlov himself never discarded the idea that his dogs felt emotion, and even seemed convinced that his dogs contracted a form of PTSD when his lab was flooded. Behaviorism, which carefully avoided talking about the emotional state of animal subjects in any way, was succeeded by the cognitive revolution, which came about during the most recent technological revolution and appropriately likened the human brain to a kind of cognitive computer, with various brain structures functioning as ‘inputs’ and ‘outputs’. Many premier and influential neuroscientists still, to this day, believe that emotions are a uniquely human phenomenon; that emotions are somehow ‘read-out’ by higher cognitive centers in the brain and animals therefore do not feel true emotions (LeDoux, 2016).

We now know that the hard science simply doesn’t support this idea. As a result, some other powerful and influential neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have even gone so far as to completely reverse their thinking and admit that the old ‘read-out’ theory of emotions was wrong and that emotions are generated by more evolutionarily ancient brain circuits (Damasio, 2010). What hard science has shown us — and what Jaak Panksepp had been saying for decades before his death — is that emotions are a fundamental property of animal life and an extremely basic, absolutely integral ingredient in any and all consciousness, including the ‘cognitive’ consciousness that underlies every single human thought.

Jaak Panksepp and his ‘affective neuroscience’ perspective takes the position opposite the behaviorists and the cognitivists that followed them; Panksepp has been stating that emotions are a fundamental property of all animal life for decades, even as his work was marginalized and largely ignored by the mainstream neuroscientific community, which continues to be awash in outdated behavioral and cognitive models of thinking. Despite Panksepp’s incredible marginalization and the fact that basically nobody ever talks about his work, many of his ideas are proving to be incredibly prophetic and far-sighted while also being anchored in the hard neuroscience that Freud and others craved but simply didn’t have the technology to access. Hard neuroscience has been largely missing from psychology and psychiatry, where psychoanalysis has largely and half-assedly been replaced by pharmacotherapy, to the detriment of the happiness and health of us all — except the pill dealers.

Panksepp’s invaluable contributions to the field, which are based in the hard neuroscientific work he did studying affective/emotional systems across mammalian species, have the potential to alleviate human suffering on an inconceivable scale, especially given the astounding rates of addiction, anxiety, depression, obesity, and other ‘mental disorders’ that we live with today, which might be better understood as emotional disorders given both the opaqueness of the term ‘mental disorder’ and the ever-mounting evidence that emotional processing is absolutely critical in our understanding and treatment of these disorders.

Panksepp, prescient in his identification of the neural circuits underlying social connection and grief among mammals, predicted that understanding and treating brain inflammation would be critical in our future understanding of depression. His prediction has been validated by the recent breakthroughs in psychoneuroimmunology that prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that inflammation in the brain is implicated in all kinds of mental and other disorders, including depression (Nakazawa, 2020). Panksepp also showed astounding foresight in his relatively early discussions of the importance of understanding epigenetic processes — but we cannot afford to wait another decade for Panksepp to be proven right yet again. It is time to bring the absolute treasure trove of affective neuroscience to the forefront of the treatment of emotional and mental disorders.

Panksepp describes emotions as ancient survival-valuation systems that have both an affective, emotional, ‘feeling’ dimension and also engender specific actions, like seeking an escape when the FEAR circuit is stimulated. Panksepp did decades of homologous/cross-species mammalian research and testing of the various emotional circuits that he discovered existed deep in the ancient, evolutionarily pre-human, sub-cortical, subconscious structures that exist in all mammalian brains. He used probes to electrically stimulate these various emotional circuits and observed the effects of the stimulation on various levels and among different structures in the various circuits, among his other extensive testing and research.

Panksepp determined that all mammals have 7 primary-process emotional survival-valuation systems. Humans have evolutionarily maintained these more ancient systems because they are the basis of survival, and because we wouldn’t be conscious at all without these systems. The 7 primary-process emotions, in the order that they evolved, are as follows: SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, GRIEF/CONNECTION and PLAY. Panksepp stylizes the primary-process emotions in all caps in order to be extremely clear as to the function of these fundamental systems, and I will do the same. This is hard neuroscience; we can’t allow it to devolve into psychological wordplay and semantics.",9,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5385952}"

I will try to make this message short because my story is very long as I'm sure is a lot of yours is. I began taking alprazolam 3 years ago while I was the full-time caregiver of my grandfather who was slowly dying. I became addicted to alprazolam after I purchased a gram of pure alprazolam powder off the dark web. I never knew how much I was taking I only knew that I was taking very little in the morning and at night. Over the years my use of alprazolam continued, and it got me through some really difficult times while I was living alone, while I quit drinking alcohol, while I quit smoking cannabis, while I quit smoking tobacco, etc. Now my life has become very good, I run in the mountains, I have a girlfriend, my life has been really nice, compared to what it was when I started alprazolam. I practice meditation everyday. Everything has been really blessed. But my alprazolam use has continued and my supply was nearly running out. So yesterday I went to the clinic here in the south of Chile to see if there was a doctor who could help me and luckily a psychiatrist saw me and listened to my story and was very kind. But I have some concerns about his method of helping me slowly get off of alprazolam. I was given a prescription for clotiazepam, alprazolam and lexapro. he told me he was really worried about my use of alprazolam over the years without any sort of medical supervision. He also told me that he wanted to make sure that during this process my serotonin levels in my brain were balanced. He told me he does not like to prescribe alprazolam but in my case he has no choice. I tried to tell him that what I really needed was to slowly convert to the use of Valium and with that I'd be able to slowly quit taking benzos. I don't understand why he gave me such a short acting benzo. I also realized that this because this is the first time that I've ever taken a dose alprazolam because I've always been using pure alprazolam powder and had no idea how much I was actually using. Yesterday I took my first 1 mg alprazolam and it was a lot stronger than I thought so this morning I took a half milligram of alprazolam and it's perfect. So I realized today to my surprise that I haven't been taking as much as I thought over the years and it should be a smooth transition to Valium and then slowly quitting over the course of 6 to 12 months ideally. Can any of you guys give me advice about the use of the super short acting benzo he gave me? Should I find another doctor who's willing to give me Valium to help me quit or should I continue with the plan he's giving me yesterday. I also took 5 mg of lexapro before bed last night. I agree with him that this will help to manage both depression and anxiety as I wean off benzos.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5498449}"

I started a taper when I was cut off about 9 months ago. I started using RC benzos to crossover, as well as other RC benzos to taper. 

I finally jumped off in September 2020 and went through the worst of it the past few months. It did get better in terms of physical withdrawal. But the mental part just hasn't been right.

I've recently moved, I have my own place. My gf and. Im unemployment and currently waiting on photo ID  since here in my state we do real ID now so everyone is required to get a New photo copy of their id. I'm still waiting for mine. But as far as work goes I've had some interviews. Waiting on the big one this week. Anyways I've saved money over the summer and with loosing my job due to covid we have been living off unemployment. Loosing my job and the dui I got shortly after is what's really bummed me the fuck out. So I'm living ok. But I've just been dealing with some shit. Some very stresful shit. Not having a license. Not working. Not knowing wtf is going to happen. I CANNOT SLEEP FOR SHIT. My motivation is shot. I can't communicate with ppl or want to. I have been a Suboxone patent for 6 months and recently got the Sublocade injection. I'm ready to be done with that and tapering with the tablets is always been impossible so the injection seems ideal for me. Best decision I've made on that part. But I'm not here to talk about that. 

So over the past several years I've use gabapentin since it helps with a lot of things drugs like Benzo, amps, and opioids help with so I've been on that. But when I decided to quit benzos 4 months back I lost my Dr for it so it's been a struggle without. Just 2 days ago I finally got a appointment with a psychiatrist. She didn't even hesitate.  Gave me back 800mg gabapentin with I'm happy about that and 0.5mg klonopin to take as needed 30. So far I've taken 3. I'm not kicking myself in the ass but one in the morning and 2 at night make every once or so a week just helps with some of the shit I've been struggling with. The gabapentin does the job for mostly everything else. I don't even feel like I'm on Suboxone with the Sublocade shot I just don't feel the craving or sick.


Now I ask for this dosage and quantity. I plan to only dose as mentioned upbove once or twice a week. Or take 1 here and there as needed. Now granted I don't feel the feel good feeling because my tolerance was about 8mg Xanax and 10mg clonazolam just last year. But I do feel the medical benefits from taking just one 05mg klonopin. Espically with the gabapentin.  So anyways, that's what's been going on with me. I guess I just can't seem to kick this stuff for good",15,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4944098}"

I just went through life self medicating instead of actually dealing with the issues that lead me to using drugs. Anyhow in the fall of 2017 I suffered my first benzodiazepine withdrawal and it was horrible. Extreme anxiety, feeling of impending doom, I couldn’t think, I had such horrible anxiety and was feeling like I wasn’t real or like reality was altered or something, they call it depersonalization and derealization. Now here is where I lucked out, it’s my understanding that temazepam is a very weak benzo and I think that that is what saved me from the full on opening of gate level of hell that is Benzo withdrawal but believe me I still experienced and suffered through it although I was able to overcome it with a pretty easy taper. But like I said, due to me not getting to the root cause of my problems I was soon taking temazepam again this time for about a year about a month ago the interdose withdrawals appeared again and now I understand that I have absolutely gotta stop these pills and I should understand now that these pills have the potential to absolutely ruin my life as I know firsthand how excruciating the withdrawal is. I guess I just want some advice from others who’ve gotten off these pills abd stayed off what keeps them from returning to the pills especially when they offer so much relief sometimes in terms of relaxation and calmness. For about a month now I’ve been tapering and for the past week it’s been only drops from an eye dropper under my tongue when the anxiety hits and I can feel the withdrawal creeping in. I also take a couple drops at night cause I’m scared of going into a seizure while sleeping. But today I haven’t had anything and luckily the withdrawal feeling hasn’t shown up today so I’m thinking I might be getting away lucky. I’ve wrotten in other Benzo recovery groups and have had a person write a rude comment talking about how I was wasting time with such a weak Benzo at such a low dose, but the fact is I still suffered with the full range of Benzo withdrawal symptoms where I was so scared my heart was beating out of my chest, I felt like I was gonna die, anxiety, had to just pace back and forth for a long time, the worst was the depersonalization and de realization. I all of a sudden had food allergies I didn’t have, I couldn’t eat foods I used to or drink coffee. But I will never take another Benzo from here I’ve worked on my issues and I know I am now strong enough and capable to live life without drugs. And let me say, for my fellow individuals going through Benzo withdrawal, that you are honestly and truly one of the strongest MF’s on earth, if you don’t take anything from Benzo withdrawal do take the fact that it takes a seriously strong and badass person to conquer Benzo addiction and withdrawal. But yeah how I got off it was just mixing the pill with water and taper like that, at first I would just drink it than stated taking less and less to the point of using an eye dropper and dropping it on my tongue. Today have had no symptoms so I’m hoping I’m rounding the bend to freedom.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6933652}"

I was on 2mg a day for 9 years and I'm 26 years old. I quit taking klonopin cold turkey but I did take librium for 3 days in detox to avoid withdrawals from alcohol (I was also drinking a fifth a day)
Still, clonazepam was my biggest demon.
Hell I barely even smoke weed anymore! Not purposefully really. It just doesn't do me like it used to. 
Never thought I'd make it this far. I honestly thought I'd be better off just taking it forever. At least that's what I told myself before. 
So I stopped having panic attacks about 2 weeks ago and it only got better from there.
I eat well. I lost 16 lbs. I look way better. 
I am currently filling out my FAFSA to go back to school. I am seeing a counselor once a week. I tested myself for anything crazy like STDs and I'm clean lol. I get my blood work back tomorrow for my liver enzymes etc. 
I bought new clothes. I actually CARE ABOUT MY LIFE. I care about my future. 
Although life has hit me very hard. I am having to deal with the repercussions of everything I'd done wrong in the past. I know I have to deal with them at some point so I may as well deal with them now. I'm actively seeing my doctor once a week and have found the correct meds to treat bipolar disorder which definitely helps a ton.
My memory is still a bit foggy. I lose stuff constantly but it's continuously getting better. Time isn't going by so slowly anymore. It seems like the initial withdrawal lasted forever but now I can't seem to keep up with the days. They just fly by! I've started working and tinkering with computers again. Coding in linux etc. That requires some concentration and brain power so I know I'm doing better. I no longer have vertigo and my vision isn't as blurry. I went to the eye doctor and got glasses after having lost my glasses nearly a year ago (the glasses are not related to the vertigo, my vision is significantly less blurry even without my glasses.) My ears no longer ring. Video games are interesting again. I can sleep again! I actually sleep a little too much but that beats the hell out of barely sleeping at all. 
One thing I have noticed is that I seem to have reverted to my prior klonopin state. Which would mean I still feel like a 17 year old which totally sucks. It feels like I'm emotionally stunted in that sense and I'm having to catch up reeeaaaal fast.
I cannot wait to see how much I improve. I can't wait to go back to school and get a real job where I can finally have some nice things in my life.

The list of cons is getting very small. The pros definitely outweigh the cons at this point. There's no turning back. I'm so glad I found this subreddit. It's helped keep me on track. I'm sure some of you have seen me post throughout this little journey and I will continue to post.

There's hope guys! After the worst it only gets better. 
It's all totally worth it.

But I am just trying to process the reality of this situation. 

This is not drug withdrawals right? This is a form of brain damage? It's not just a bit of cognitive fog and readjusting to a drug it's more like a real injury? The harsh reality is that doctors simply don't understand this because the brain is so complex? The existence of protracted withdrawals doesn't really make sense in terms of the severity for much longer than opiate withdrawals for example?

Is the reality that this is just a new normal that we have to radically accept? Do I hold on to the belief that the human brain is powerful enough to heal enough that I can feel like I did before taking benzos eventually? Sorry guys I am only about 3 months out but really still grappling with a warped sense of reality and terrible cognitive difficulty.

I was taking clonazolam for about a year and was abusing it severely until March of 2017. My order got delayed in the mail and I had two grand mal seizures and ended up in the ER. I viewed the seizures as a sort of ""Hard Reset"" on my brain because the withdrawal symptoms weren't all that bad after that and got better over time. After that, life was never the same but slowly got better and my living situation got better as well. About 6 weeks ago, depression and anxiety got the better of me, and I ordered 90 2mg Etizolam. I thought I could control myself and use them as needed for anxiety. I was wrong, and ended up taking 4mg+ daily for the last 5 weeks until yesterday. I finally confessed to my wife who confiscated the bottle and immediately went to see my GP the next day, which was yesterday. My doctor is truly a godsend, because she immediately looked up the etizolam/diazepam equivalency and put me on a taper schedule, but I'm worried the dosage is too low and that the taper is too quick. She has me taking 10mg twice daily for 5 days, then 5 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 5mg once daily for 6 days and then 2.5mg once daily for 6 days, and that's the end of the taper, so a total of 19 10mg tablets over 20 days. She also prescribed me gabapentin to take twice daily. Already on day two, I'm feeling extreme withdrawal symptoms between doses of diazepam. She is extremely understanding and compassionate and is willing to listen to input based on my experience. I realize I was only on etizolam for 5ish weeks, but is this taper too quick?

My questions are about glutamate storms.  Mainly, if I am having a glutamate storm, is taking a benzo to stop it a good idea?  I quit benzos well over a year ago and didn't ever want to take them again for fear of having to do that wd again and even just shorter term but unbearable rebound anxiety.   If I take a benzo to stop a glutamate storm after having gone through extreme withdrawal, am I just delaying another storm that could be even worse when the benzo wears off?  Is phenibut a better or worse idea?   Does anyone know if taking otc lithium orotate 5mg (not high dose carbonate like they prescribe for bipolar) contributes to overproduction of glutamate during a glutamate storm?  I'm reading mixed messages about this in online medical info that is difficult to parse. 

There's more context below if anyone cares to read, but it's not necessary - I am mostly just wondering about the above questions. 
-
---
-


I know these are questions for a psychiatrist, and I've been trying to talk to mine, but the call center won't allow emergency appointments (phone or otherwise), so I have to wait a few weeks, but the crisis I'm having can't wait that long.  At the same time, I don't think this is something that is worth going to the hospital for and that would be extremely difficult to put it lightly.  So I'm really hoping someone here might have some ideas.  It's a long shot I know, but I've seen some really kind and knowledgeable people post on here before. 

I quit a very high dose research chemical benzo in early 2019, had severe wd, it was bad - you know the stories, then on into terrible PAWs.  I'd say it took 10-11 months to get back to being ""ok.""  I've had ongoing issues ever since, but for the most part felt like the actual withdrawal was done. 

About a week ago, during a time of great upset, I made a stupid and self destructive choice to try some new drugs recreationally.  They involved a stimulant, atypical opiod, kratom potentiated with grapefruit juice, and kanna smoked with weed (kanna is a completely legal mood boost herb but is known to be an SNRI).  I think I gave myself mild serotonin syndrome.  It didn't seem mild to me, but I didn't go to the hospital and I'm still alive so it could have been worse.  At that time, I took benzodiazepines both to deal with the anxiety as well as to hopefully protect my brain from excitotoxicity (which is basically what I'm also asking about now).   Ever since then I've been having episodes of extreme anxiety, and also episodes that I recognize as glutamate storms, having some during withdrawal, including during seizures I think is what led to many long term or permanent problems and impairments.  I want to avoid adding to that at all costs.  This is more than just regular rebound anxiety.  I know that, and what is going on here is something else entirely.
I am not sleeping, having had almost no sleep but for short periods of dozing.  I'm sure it's a complex mixture of factors, but I don't know what's causing all these issues - is it just because I took a benzo again and threw off my whole GABA-glutamate system?  Is it still a result of what might have been Serotonin Syndrome?  Should I take my OTC lithium that used to seem to help mood.  

Again, I realize these questions are waaay beyond the scope of this sub, but I'm flailing here.  I expect some of you here know what that's like.  Apologies for the haphazard and weird post - as you might imagine, I can't write very cogently right now.

I (30 M) was addicted to prescription and R.C. benzodiazepines for many many years. Last year I successfully completed an extended taper from 6mg/day of Clonazepam and various high potency benzos such as clonazolam. Since getting off my life has been going better than expected, however I received a DUI last year due to my increased alcohol consumption (yes, I knew not to drink but did anyway.) I am currently on pre-trial and am abstaining from alcohol. It has not been easy and the cravings & PAWS gets very bad on some days. This morning I saw my addiction specialist and he gave me a prescription used to assist alcohol cravings called Acamprosate (Campral.) 

After doing some research online, it appears to work by inhibiting glutamate release and up-regulation of GABA receptors, and opens the ion channel in a novel way and doesn’t cause intoxication. 

I will be taking my first dose tomorrow after work when my cravings for alcohol and benzodiazepines typically gets pretty bad. I will let you all know wether or not it is effective at reducing cravings and negative PAWS symptoms.

It’s been helpful in terms of knowing what to expect and also realizing that there are so many stories like mine and that I’m not alone in this crazy world of benzo dependency. 

I’ve been prescribed Klonopin (alongside various antidepressants) for about 5 years at .5mg, following my brother’s death and subsequent panic episodes. It’s almost always been a daily medication for me. I’ve also had bouts of taking street Xanax or “presses” intermingled throughout those 5 years. Thankfully it never got too out of control, but my taking them wasn’t without consequence.

More recently, I began to take them regularly when out of Klonopin, or sometimes in addition to. The pandemic has been hard for me. It started with wanting to quell the immense anxiety I was feeling around not knowing what would happen with my job, and then became a crutch to deal with working with people during a pandemic. I’d say my daily intake was anywhere from .5mg-2mg per day. I didn’t see it as a problem because it was nearly equivalent to the Klonopin dose I’d been prescribed. 

Soon enough I was experiencing what I now know are interdose withdrawals. Woke up sweaty, dehydrated and with a headache. Heart beating out of my chest. Nauseous. It felt like crippling anxiety and so I figured meds were needed to fix it. And they did. 20-30 minutes after my morning dose, I felt right as rain. Or I thought I did. My anxiety certainly was gone. But what replaces it was a messy brain fog. I no longer wanted to deal with anything that could agitate me, because agitation is what I felt when I needed more meds. I couldn’t control my CNS responses. Every moment without meds, I felt weak. Taking the meds didn’t put me in stumbling stupor, it made life bearable. It gave me a warm blanket to cocoon into. It gave me rest and naps. I could sleep. I could wind down and forget. But that’s really it.

I realized I was living but I wasn’t thriving. Nothing had meaning. Writers block hit me hard. I didn’t feel creative. I didn’t feel happy anymore. I simply felt “there”. There was no contrast between highs and lows anymore. No bouts of energy or hope. I was existing.

Now I am 6 weeks into recovery. I’ve been able to taper off the Xanax and switch back to my prescribed .5mg Klonopin. Except this time, I’m not taking it every day. The days I do take it, I take half a dose. Yes, I’ve been going through withdrawal. Yes, at times I couldn’t even handle being at the grocery store due to stimulation overload. I’ve had body aches. I’ve had insomnia. I’ve had the headaches. Shit, I still have the headaches, the muscle tension, the jaw pain Freon clenching. But I also now have energy in the morning. I have focus. I’m moving toward something. I can read books now. I can write. I can thrive!

I’ve been going back and forth from klonopin for 23, or 24 years with a month clean twice and a handful of 1 week to 10 days I bare knuckled it along the way. This time I am tapering under a doctors care. I’m also bipolar, was DX’d that at age 16. So I’m on other meds too. But the main ones that are helping with this is the seroquel and the Hydoxy something, I know it’s ferric for visceral or Aterax. Plus lithium and Lexapro. So she got me down to .5 cut in half so .25 of Klonopin a day. I’m feeling it pretty hard but from my experience when I go to zero that’s when the hard stuff, the crazyness, the crying for no reason, the huge monster sized panic attacks. But my doctor gave me seroquel 200 at night and 100 I can cut into prices hiring the day at my discretion. So I cut it into 1/4’s and take 1 until I feel better or fall asleep. My real thing is that I’d LOVE TO HEAR FROM some people that was on it as long as me and successfully got off of it, knowing that other people were at bad as me and got better would be huge to me. My mind keeps telling me I’m going to feel like this for the rest of my life so I may as well stay on them. I know that’s not true but that voice Tells me I will feel like this forever.

Going through withdrawal from 3 mg Xanax ER.  So I apologize for rant, don’t wish this feeling on anyone

CVS induced WD’s again😡😡

Refill day went from happy to horror in a minute. I am prescribed by my psychiatrist 1 mg Xanax ER 3 x per day. Having been prescribed them in some form for almost 30 yrs I’ve dealt with every pharmacy there is and the ever changing policies on refills. It’s a freakin nightmare for those who are on high dosages when refill day gets close. And my anxiety isn’t from being short by not taking the exact prescribed amount, I have been very good over the years to take just what I’m prescribed. Haven’t been short on my bottle in over 20 yrs so I’m fine with taking them as prescribed.
      The issue is with CVS and their refill policies. My psychiatrist sent them my refill script to them before Christmas to ensure I had my medication by my refill date of January 8 th.  Ok so first issue I have to hurdle is they carry garbage brand generic Xanax and will switch generics regularly without telling you and their is a big difference in how certain brands work I was stunned going through that learning experience. Same medication and dosage but wow, some don’t even take the edge off even a little. So I found that CVS will special order the brand you prefer. Most other big chains here in Florida wouldn’t do that they told me I have to take what they offer. 
Anyway special orders take a day to come in and here is the kicker, no deliveries on weekends!!!!! So if your refill day is on a Friday which it was this time, they order it on Friday, but with no weekend deliveries you must wait until Monday at 2 pm for the next delivery. That makes no sense, you are forcing patients to go without medication with these policies. 
    Sorry for the rant it’s just so frustrating, feel like shit with no medication because CVS doesn’t get deliveries on weekends. Its my refill date, I took them all responsibly and am coming to you on the date you told me I could obtain my refill. You simply tell me sorry there are no deliveries on weekends. I ask what am I supposed to do without medication, at that point the pharmacist pops in and says you cannot go from 3 mg to zero, you could have seizures. Yes, thank you I am aware of that and thanks for making me feel more nervous. She says you can call around and see if any other pharmacies have them. Is that not your job to find the medication. 
31 more hours to go until I can get my prescription that was supposed to be filled Friday morning. Or, as the pharmacist said as I walked away, if you start to feel really bad you should go to the ER and they can help you. 
Unbelievable, day of hell coming up all due to pharmacy bullshit that puts the patients best interest last and they simply don’t care if you have you meds or not. Your looked upon as a drug seeker who is missing his fix. 
Has to be a better way to get your medications filled, current system is seriously flawed.

From getting arrested, to getting bailed out then going straight back to the Xanax just to break my bail and black out before going back in so I wouldn’t remember doing my time. To overdosing and having 4+ grand mol seizures in a row. To relapsing I can’t even count how many times for no reason at all, no triggers, no nothing. I’m from Canada 🇨🇦 and met this girl on Instagram 9 years ago. We video chatted almost every single day (we had our fights of course) but we were always each other’s rocks. She has a girlfriend so she was always apart of the picture too in our friendship and she introduced me to one of her friends too. Recently my “best friend of 9 years” started what me and the friend who she introduced me to have fake seizures after stopping her abuse of Xanax which she claims was pressed with heroin and fentanyl for attention and to get more from her primary doctor because she thought she would give it to her as a seizure medication after years of abuse. So she decided to lie and say she was getting Xanax and Ativan prescriptions through the hospital every time she had a seizure but she said they never found anything in her brain, even when she “had a seizure during her brain scan” I’ve been told she’s lied about a lot of medical issues throughout our friendship. Physical and mentally. So blah blah blah she’s on Xanax or Ativan (she would mix up which prescriptions she has) Me and the friend she introduced me would talk about her faking her seizures because well on video chat those didn’t look like seizures as she was talking and taking bong rips. As I’m getting sick of her constant lying I finally decided to block her, but somewhat kept in contact with the friend she introduced me to because I don’t have anybody else to talk to throughout the day. So she would video chat me whenever she was done hanging out or video chatting with my ex best friend of 9 years. I asked politely to not talk about my ex best friend on 9 years but she continues to talk about all of the stuff she’s suddenly buying her when she knows I’m personally struggling and I genuinely don’t want to hear about her. Tonight that “friend” she introduced me to said she had a breakdown before work and called her doctor to prescribe her 1mg Xanax. Everything she was doing on video chat tonight indicated 100% she wasn’t on Xanax or any type of benzodiazepine. So moral or the story I’m still constantly triggered with Xanax one way or another and I’ve had some sitting in my room for awhile so it’s not like I would have to go out and get any. They’re just there. I’m trying fucking hard not to touch them, so fucking hard because I’ve been so fucking lonely and what else is there to do besides enjoy another high?

I also need to mention, I started 75mg Effexor XR 3 months ago when I started the intense taper. I think this made things more difficult at first, but I now believe it has helped me. 

I hope I can be strong and keep this up. I met with my Doctor this morning and she was really happy for me. But here is where I might be in trouble. She gave me SIXTY 1mg pills (Usually get 30) and we are hoping this will have me set for a while and it should! I just am worried I do not have the will power knowing all the pills are there. That's what got me in this mess to begin with. 

I got my refill before work and instantly took an entire 1mg pill (Dammit) I'm already thinking how nice of a Friday night I would have if I took another but I CAN'T go down this road again. My wife loves me and has supported me through this all and I can't do that to her. I plan to give her my pills after work and have her control them for me as I simply do not trust myself. I am planning to keep using weed until the end of this month and then cut that out. Time to Grow up and be a father soon... I hope.

Horrible anxiety, and although the last seven years was a blur I don’t regret it. I really needed it. 

But now as I am in my 30s and wanting to have kids, I started my taper 1.5 years ago. I’m down to just under .5 mg a day. I’m really impressed so even gotten that far, but I’ve literally been “dope sick” for a year and a half. I don’t know what else to call it. 

This last week has been the most difficult week ever, and for some reason, I’m feeling so discouraged… It feels like I’ll never be able to get below half a milligram… I’ve tried so many times, just to get it under half a milligram, and it feels like an elephant is literally stepping on my chest.

I know the withdrawals are on a huge spectrum of gray area with Clonopin, which is unfortunate because sometimes I feel like I’m the only person in the world that knows what the symptoms are, but it gives me some comfort to know that there’s people in this group that I understand it. My worst symptoms are that my entire body hurts all the time, it’s like when you have body aches from the flu. They just don’t go away when I take ibuprofen. The other horrible symptom I have is it feels like there’s something really heavy on my chest like an elephant, or my chest feels tight and I need to do a lot of opening stretches to kind of open my heart because it feels like my chest is just tight all the time. I’m just so sick of being in pain, I know I’m on the last leg of it, but man, this last half a milligram feels like a marathon that I’m not sure I can run :( 
It’s been a year and a half, and luckily with the quarantine it’s actually worked really well in my favor for me to detox. I feel really bad that I have this opportunity at the price of the world.

Also clean from alcohol and amphetamines and everything else!,"Hi guys! I've already made two posts like this on days 16 and 19. It totally helps me when I can write about it and see my own progress.
I was on 2mg of klonopin for 9 years and drinking everyday since I was 19 although there were definitely party years in there. I have been prescribed Vyvanse and Adderall on and off since I was 14. I was doing crystal meth hard from around late 18 to 22. 
I was also prescribed xanax back then. The doctor literally have me klonopin xanax and adderall basically just because I asked. 
I used to take every drug in the book all at the same time. 
I used to wait tables on meth, adderall, alcohol, weed, xanax, and klonopin combined every single day. Sometimes I would even combine that with pain killers and shrooms or lsd. Pain killers were more of something I would take for a week or two and put back down. It's crazy because people didn't even really know.. I still always looked good. Took vitamins etc. Drank enough water lala. And if I thought I was getting too wild I would just pop a seroquel to pass out. I should probably be dead. Multiple times.
Talk about the prime of my life being gone (I actually think prime is somewhere in your 30s tbh)
However, out of all of these, klonopin was my favorite. It's been the hardest thing to kick.
It's been the one thing other than weed that has been a constant. 
I did calm down quite a bit after 22 when I stopped doing crystal meth.
After that I was taking my prescribed klonopin and adderall and my alcohol use picked up significantly. Started drinking a fifth every day. Then I quit Adderall in July. Still drinking and taking klonopin though. 
This is still really just a post about klonopin withdrawals though.. that was the killer in all of this. 
So.. I actually want to give myself some credit here because HOLY SHIT I CANNOT BELIEVE I've made it this far. I feel like a totally different person! 
I've been extremely busy for the past 10 days or so. I literally just started toughing it all out and doing every little thing I thought I couldn't do and I did it feeling like absolute SHIT. Like I literally almost went to the ER multiple times and maybe I should have but I am pretty convinced I was just having some major panic attacks. I picked myself up and I started grocery shopping. Working. Driving. Going to see people. Cleaning. Cooking. Watching Netflix. Getting my haircut. Buying new clothes. Fixing my car. Finding a new job. Seeing a therapist. Getting some medications sorted out. You name it. 
Stopping klonopin was similar to ohhh idk something like being in a car traveling at some major high speed only to be stopped abruptly and being kicked into a blizzard on a mountain and falling off of the mountain thinking there's no way anyone would find you (you get the picture) Literally the worst thing ever. Somehow I did it!
I'm going back to my old self and I'm liking it even more and more. 
My memory is shot but it's starting to return. I noticed today for the first time since quitting that I was actually retaining some information! I'm not as nervous around people and can actually make conversation without being overly concerned about my appearance and how I sound. All of that dumb mess. 
I'm just becoming more confident. More confident than I was on klonopin. Which wasn't very confident but I could fool you. I fooled everyone for a very very long time.

I'm just so happy to be here. I could picture my life without all of the other drugs. I just couldn't picture ever getting off klonopin or putting down the bottle. 
So now it's day 22 and there's no going back. 
I love this subreddit. It's helped me immensely to come read other people's stories and beable to share mine as well.
You guys rock.

Writing to share the news that I'm planning to jump fully off of benzos this Thursday. I was on .5mg clonazepam at night, every night, for sleep for over 7 years. I know this is not a large dose to some people but it was a significant crutch for me. I was completely dependent on it, and only now that I'm coming off of it can I fully grasp how miserable it was making me on a daily basis (i.e. inter-dose/tolerance withdrawal most likely).  I really thought I would be taking it forever. Now that I'm nearing the finish line, I already feel like I'm getting reacquainted with my old self - someone who I haven't seen in so long. It's a wonderful feeling and also makes me teary. 

I've been tapering since the beginning of October - schedule below in case it's helpful for anyone else. It has been very difficult. I've experienced an incredible array of symptoms (brain zaps, extreme light/sound sensitivity, inability to drive, insomnia, pounding heart, crazy anxiety, nights sweats, vertigo, etc), but all in all it was still \*tolerable\* and \*achievable\* and I have no regrets.

Things that really helped:   
\- supportive partner, parents, doctor, friends - I did my best to establish a support system before I started the taper  
\- the Ashton manual  
\- a sound machine at night  
\- the Calm App  
\- this community!  
\- exercising on a near-daily basis even when I felt like shit  
\- working from home   


My schedule: 

Initial dose: .5mg clonazepam at night  
Weeks 1-2: 0.375mg clonazepam + 1mg diazepam  
Weeks 3-4: .25mg clonazepam + 2mg diazepam  
Weeks 5-6: .125mg clonazepam + 3mg diazepam  
Weeks 7-8: 4mg diazpam  
Weeks 9-10: 3mg diaz, Weeks 11-12: 2mg diaz, Weeks 13-14: 1mg diaz  
Week 15: Jump!! 

Weeks 1-6 were definitely the hardest. It was much easier to taper once I was only taking diazepam but still no fun.

What led up to this was a year or so of taking like 6mgs at once to get high, then for about 3-5 days I'd take .75 mgs every day to prevent withdrawal because I would feel minor withdrawal on those days that I didn't take any at all. So even before this I was in some withdrawal if I didn't take .75mgs. But it was relative to this very minor withdrawal. Then I'd take another 6mgs on like the 5th or 6th day and then for another 3-5 days I'd take the .75 every day, rinse and repeat for a year. 

I thought xanax had a shorter half-life so I thought I was fine. As long as I was only taking a pill and a half (.75 mgs) for the majority of the days that it was fine to abuse it once every 5 days. Things were going just fine. But I started doing more than just 6mgs on the days that I could get high, I had plenty surplus, I had 120 .5mg pills per month. BUT then the three months leading up to last October I was an absolute idiot and took more than my 6mgs and then was so fucked up that I forgot how much I was taking and took even more. It was like I was sleepwalking and would take more xanax. I took like 44 pills, 22mgs. And yea I know I almost died. So then I was short on pills and said they were stolen to my doctor. Got another prescription, and continued doing my 6mgs then .75mgs once a day for 4-5 days... Same schedule basically. But next refill I did more than 6mgs and basically did it again, took a HUGE amount on accident. And was short on pills again. This time I got my mom to get a prescription for me. Continued doing my regular schedule of getting high every 5th day or so and as little as possible xanax in between highs. August comes and guess what happens with my new prescription... I risked it again by taking more than I should've and it ended with me waking up with nearly all of my prescription gone again. At this point I'm out of schemes to get more, it's 11 days until we can get more xanax and am forced to take less than what it would take to keep me comfortable every day much less get high every 5th day. I had to take a pill and a quarter instead of a pill and a half and just a single pill for 4 of those days, and had to take nothing for 3 days after that giant dose. So basically I nuke my tolerance and have to immediately taper. It was around the 8th or 9th day that I was starting to feel really strange, shakey, restless, heart racing. The next morning I'm in worse withdrawal than I've ever felt, and I've felt my fair share of opiate withdrawal from everything from dope to tramadol, to methadone and back. 

Luckily my dad had some xanax, I was forced to bring him in on the situation. So it takes 6 pills/3mgs to get me out of that horrendous state. A few days later of taking that dose I am forced to drop to 4 pills because that's all I've got per month, 120 .5mg pills per month. That was around the start of October. It's not getting much better. I didn't think it would last this long. I didn't know what I was fucking with, I thought it was a shorter half-life drug.

So here are some of the questions I need answering. Like, at first I thought it was just that last time taking around 45 or so pills that nuked my tolerance, plus being forced to immediately taper and not being able to take my large dose on the 5th that did this to me. I thought I just nuked my tolerance and it was a one-time thing. But after just how long these wds have been lasting for? And the fact that I had ""nuked my tolerance"" with a hug dose of 22mgs twice before? And this didn't happen those times? This wasn't from just a one-time thing was it... Was this because I was taking 11-12 pills every 4-5 days? Is it because the half-life is so long that just a few days in between large doses didn't make nearly enough of a difference? Because I am not taking any more xanax per month than I was before, 120 pills per month, I am just taking it differently now. Do the larger doses just build and build on top of each other? After I took a large dose (6mgs) or especially one of those gargantuan doses 22mgs), I didn't need to take anything at all the next day in order to feel completely finefine. I should have taken that as a sign of this drug's long half-life. Because with oxycontin, you couldn't even feel fine 12 hours after taking a large dose. 

Should I keep on this path of 4 pills a day and suffer or try and go back to the way things were with 11 pills every 5 days and a pill and a half the days in between? Would that work? The reason I want to go back to that is because I was right nearing the end of my Methadone taper. I was getting close to the end but I had to go back up on my dosage. I've lost so many months of methadone taper because of this. And I've got chronic nerve pain that methadone makes worse, it's so bad I can't work. So the first priority is to get off of methadone. There's nothing at all pushing me to get off benzos. This xanax shit has delayed that by months. It's so shitty. Obviously, I don't want the last two months of me enduring xanax withdrawal to be for nothing, but there is no rush to get off xanax, there is for methadone. So the sunk cost fallacy comes into play here, am I willing to give up those 7 weeks of pure effort I put in so I can switch to dealing with methadone? Yes. 

Yes, I've tried to get an increase in my prescription, but no luck. Parents are understandably unwilling to get me a prescription/increase. I know that switching to Valium or another longer-lasting benzo is much better to taper off of, but I can't. See, half that 120 pills of xanax comes from me and the other half from my moms prescription. If I switch mine to Valium then I'm still taking Xanax as well and the Methadone clinic drug tests me and I'd be fucked. I'd lose my 2 weeks of take-home methadone doses and have to come in every day. After that, if I'm still failing drug tests I'd get kicked out. I can't freeze enough pee now to ensure that I can pass all foreseeable drug tests. I feel like the urine would break down or something after months of being in the freezer and I'd get caught. 

\-So, is it possible for me to go from being very uncomfortable at 2mgs every day to back to where I was doing 5.5-6mgs every 5 days and doing .75mgs the days inbetween? 

\-Was it because of that that I'm in this long withdrawal, not because of me doing 22mgs in a single day? 

\-If I stay on this path of 2mgs a day, how much longer have I got before I can feel okay again? (again I'm on week 7ish) Will I ever feel okay at 2mgs??

\-Was dropping from 3mgs to 2mgs way too much to feasibly do?

\-If it was because of a year of doing 6mgs every 5 days instead of the single HUGE dose, can you help me to understand why? I mean, I was ending up with SURPLUS xanax at the end of the month but now when I'm doing as little xanax as possible 2mgs a day has me dying when I'm using MORE XANAX PER MONTH!? It just seems unbelievable if that's the case. 

I can't delay my methadone taper any longer. I have to either try and go back to my previous schedule or somehow try and get an increase in xanax prescription. Please help! And thank you so much for your reply in advance and reading my novel!",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66231406}"

I started using my script back in 2017 (really rough break up). I couldn't deal with the anxiety, no sleep and shitty feelings anymore. I started with 4mg, I am prescribed 3mg daily. I eventually went down to 2mg throughout time and now I am at half a mg a night.

Some nights I will forget to take it and I will barely sleep and if I do sleep, it is brief and I wake up sweating and my mind space will be fucked up until I remember that I hadn't taken my Xanax the night before.

I try to go through the rest of the day without taking any even though I feel like shit, but then I get scared I will have a seizure or something worse will happen, not to mention the possible long-term effects of quitting cold turkey so I end up taking one so I feel normal again.

I know I can cut down to .25 a night but how much more can I cut down on the dosage without feeling like absolute shit or having a seizure?

I have come a long way since 2017, but now I want to officially quit 100% without terrible withdrawals or long-term side effects.

I would really rather not go to a rehab center because I know I don't need it and I don't have the time or money for that, especially with my job.

Is there any advice you guys can give to me to help me quit 100%?

Over the last three weeks I've gone though probably 350mg of etizolam. I don't know how it got so out of control... I guess because I have a newborn and there is a lot of stress involved with that. I've dealt with anxiety and depression for years which has been treatment resistant. I've been to many psychologists, a couple stays at the psych ward, a rehab stint. Been on multiple SSRI/SNRIs for depression/anxiety and none of them helped. The only thing that did was benzodiazepines and of course they aren't appropriate for long term prescribing and here in Australia they are very strict about handing them out, especially to a young man. The anxiety and depression sort of just went away by themselves for a while, or at least the anxiety wasn't so bad. But this year with COVID, studying online and struggling, my wife suffering a hard pregnancy and labor plus her father dying... I broke and my anxiety and depression came back with a vengeance. 

Before anyone says anything, I care for my baby with my wife and there are no safety issues there. If I am at any point intoxicated/fucked up then I'm not handling the baby, most of the time the etizolam is just keeping me... normal or chill now I suppose. 

My tolerance is pretty big at the moment. I just took a dose of 15mg and I'll probably get a little bit out of that, earlier doses today of 8.75mg and 5mg did basically nothing. 

I have probably about 375mg of etizolam left, I also have 100mg of diclazepam on the way as I've heard it's good for tapering. I won't seek medical help unless absolutely necessary, i.e. if I have a seizure. Last time I was in rehab they treated me like shit and I ended up leaving and tapering off myself (that was for benzos too, Xanax, but not as bad as this. This was like 9 years ago). By the way I'm a piece of shit and my wife doesn't know about this either so I need to try and keep this hidden from her as well.

I'm not sure what the best option is but I know I need to stop. I go back to work in a week. I was thinking of taking a day off the etizolam and seeing how bad the withdrawals get over that 24 hour period and then going from there. I have plenty of phenibut on hand, and can get access to 20*400mg gabapentin or 20*150mg Lyrica or 20*350mg Soma tablets if any of that will help. I'm thinking since I have phenibut already the gabapentin and Lyrica are pointless... unless the rebound anxiety issues with those are less than with phenibut? 

Obviously I'm buying this all online, I'd get diazepam but it's fucking expensive compared to diclazepam plus I hear diclazepam is less abusable to most people.

I was also thinking of just stopping a couple of days and getting high on some H or morphine and seeing if that helps get me through the WD. I need to be functional for next week at work, and from what I remember of my last benzo WD opiate WD is a lot better (not saying it's easy that fucking sucks too).

Any advice would be much appreciated. I'm a fucking idiot I know. I thought I could use them responsibly to control my anxiety which is actually very serious and not being treated properly by doctors. But I went overboard and fucked myself and now need to get out.

TL;DR: Taken at least 300mg etizolam over the last three weeks. Although at first I had some memory loss, etc, today a total of 28.75mg (biggest dose was 15mg) just has me a bit relaxed like 5-10mg diazepam would. On hand I have phenibut and about 375mg more etizolam. I'll be getting 100mg diclazepam and a quarter gram of H plus reasonable quality poppy seeds are fairly obtainable for me. I don't even know where to start trying to quit. Thinking of just taking tomorrow off and seeing exactly how bad it gets.

I use the sleep cycle app and there is a very distinct pattern that it records when it happens. I never make it beyond stage 1 sleep and it's just a tight heartbeat type pattern with each trough being the dream and the peaks being where I move or jerk awake.

I was originally at 80mg about 4 or 5 months ago and was on a dose higher to that for around 3-6 months (illegally purchased and a relapse after a year benzo free.) It's hazy how much I was taking and how long for, it's been hazy up until around 20mg. Now I've been taking it extremely slow so I can have at least some normality in my life. I feel like it takes me a few days to get to the point where I can do things after a drop, then I start to feel pretty normal after a week or 2, then I drop again and it's a similar cycle. I've never tapered this slowly before, last time I came off a 10mg a day Xanax habit in under a month in a rehab and suffered from depersonalisation, extreme anxiety to the point where I had constant trembles and spasming for nearly 6 months after that.

I have been taking klonopin for the past two months—not daily, but .5mg, about once every three days. Last time I took a dose was on Wednesday; last time before that was Sunday.

I recognize that this is a low dose, and that ppl might make fun of me for posting. But I have had addiction issues in the past, so am very worried about withdrawal after reading things online about its long half life. Am I worrying for no reason?

Last night my anxiety was pretty bad, today about average. Is there a chance this could get bad, or is that just the voice of my normal anxiety?

It sucks hitting rock bottom but some people need to be there in order to realize they doing sum wrong.

Ive lost a lot of shit before but this time it really felt like the last straw and that I almost lost everything including my gf who is basically the one person in this world who gives a fuck about me. Makes u realize a lot but that was my rock bottom below the rock bottom I had felt before.

But it's never too late, I've been almost a month sober from everything (including weed and alcohol) and I can't even begin to describe how much better I feel . 

The thing that made me feel really really good and made me wanna share this is when I saw my pulse it has dramatically improved in a way I never even thought possible , I used to think I just had a real shitty pulse but ur nervous system will thank u if u stop. 

I got COVID which was also a factor that made me wanna stop. I also think soberness is the best way to get better. I had  been taking mirtazapine, venlafaxine (antidepressants) and valproic acid (anti seizure) supposedly to help with my recovery but I ran out of money and haven't taken them and I also gotta say I feel so much better sober than on those things. 

I invite u to try ! U won't regret it ! And always remember it IS possible to jump out of the hole one has been digging himself into. I know the body and brain take a minimum of 6 months to really get rid of all the chems and I really wanna see how much better I feel after that long if I'm already feeling great after 1 month.

So I was over the summer detoxing off opiates and was able to physically break the addiction.

A few months ago I’d have a few days break from it every now and then but for the past month I’d say it’s been a pretty constant use only at bedtime though never during the day if that helps I never double dose during the day. But my anxiety is through the roof, a severe beating heart, depersonalization, and just a general feeling of impending doom. I don’t know what to do please if anyone has any experience in tapering themselves off the temazepam I could desperately use some advice. I made a horrible decision to start taking this drug and realize that if I am to get clean I need to deal with my emotional and psychological traumas that cause me the need to take drugs that lessen anxiety I am almost certain I have PTSD which is undiagnosed.

My mental health has improved so much since taking them significantly less.

I’ve seen a lot of vague comments on here about how dangerous it is so I’m quite nervous. What about it is dangerous? 

- Mirtazipine unfortunately did not work. I just couldn’t fall asleep.

- Gabapentin is fine during the daytime for anxiety and muscle spasms, but unfortunately doesn’t make me fall asleep any faster

- Trazadone makes me feel like I can’t breathe, I think I may have some weird allergy to it. Even then, it’s a mixed bag whether it’ll work or not

- Clonodine doesn’t do much either 

I’ve tapered down to 9mg Diazepam, am and still tapering down. I take Gabapentin, Diazepam and Lexapro daily. So back to the question, am I in danger? I’m just really paranoid now. Is Seroquel really bad? I have a pretty caring and good doctor and she gave it to me as a last resort.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75495225}"

Your advice would be much appreciated,About 4 days ago (29th of December) I dropped 0.5mg of Diazepam. I was on 7.5mg before dropping to 7mg. Last night I woke up all throughout the night and the nights before I woke up super early. I am worried that dropping the dosage has messed up my sleep. Do you think I should go back up to 7.5mg and wait a while before dropping again?,1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4999567}"
