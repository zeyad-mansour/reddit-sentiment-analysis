Need Taper Plan/Advice or any support Before I Lose My Job and/or Overdose Again,"My benzo use has been on and off and it‚Äôs been my drug of choice for the past 3 years. I was benzo clean and doing 12 steps for about 7 months. These past 3 months though I‚Äôve been taking benzos(not sure what they are pressed with but they are yellow bars)At first recreationally and then I convinced myself I needed them to function better. A couple weeks later I overdosed and aspirated mixing them with oxys and that put me in the ICU and almost killed me a couple days after I got this job, but I still didn‚Äôt quit once I got out of the hospital) Ironically even though ‚ÄúI need them to function better‚Äù I got caught nodding off at my job because I was on Xanax and forgot my energy drink. I have one more chance to come back sober in 4 days to keep my job. The problem is now it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm taking 5 or 6 yellow bars and 4 energy drinks a day self medicated to get through my day currently while I‚Äôm unemployed.

1. I need 2 yellow bars ( I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you what is in them),2 energy drinks, and a lot of weed just to start my day and feel motivated enough to get up and do anything.
2. Take another yellow bar before weightlifting to ease the anxiety from pre-workout and weed and help my anxiety in the gym.
3. Take a half bar after workout to keep the anxiety away and energy drink to stay awake and do chores.
4. Take another half a bar when I feel the last half wear off
5. Depending how late I stay up 1 or 2 bars to go to sleep

I‚Äôm lost I‚Äôm obviously back dependent in such a short time and can‚Äôt get sober in 4 days without literally dying. Any advice on a possible taper plan that I can use to stay comfortable, maybe not sober by my next day scheduled to work; I consider a comfortable taper more important. I hope in 4 days though maybe I can cut down usage enough to show my boss that I‚Äôm trying and I‚Äôm getting better.

Not in recreational doses but in doses just enough to cover my anxiety but ya over time the tolerance has indeed increased the dose to a pretty high amount. 

Kinda hard to know my dose as I do it by number of drops from a liquid vial but I do 10 drops of 2mg/ml clonazolam ever 6 hours. Id guess the dose is around maybe 2-4mg of clonazolam per day but Im unsure. 

Ive been talking to a therapist and hes really adamant about me going to a rehab clinic out of state about 4 or so hours away. Ive let him know Im looking to do a slow taper route using the ashton manual to decrease the severity of the withdraws and to reduce the risk of a seizure. 

I keep explaining that a 2-4 week detox for a 5+ year long daily addiction to not only a benzo but an rc benzo thats typically considered heavier than any of the clinical ones like xanax etc. raises concerns and doesn't really track with what Ive learned over the years about benzo addiction.

 He states that Im wanting too much control over the situation than I can reasonable expect which is likely true but Im having a hard time getting any medical journals or scientific evidence out of him when it comes to his position of short inpatient tapers being safer.

 Hes adamant that being in the clinic with the medical personnel is safer since theyll be watching me but id ideally prefer to avoid having a seizure all together and throwing me straight in to a super short detox is what causes the seizures from your brains inability to adapt to the lack of benzos binding to my gaba receptors (or am I off on how this works?) 

Basically I really dont want to go to 30 days of inpatient rehab unless it really is the best option. Especially at a place that is strict where my calls are restricted to certain times or my phone is taken away because of outdated ideas of treatment and using a pretty broad treatment of all addicts when a benzo addict is going to have different needs and issues than someone with another addiction.

 For me not having my phone could only lead to a much worse experience on top of already going through severe withdrawal there as ill be left with nothing but focusing on the withdraw the entire time. 

Like I get you obviously dont want a phone around when theyre doing treatments and stuff but when Im going to be laying awake all night for days on end suffering from severe withdrawl I just dont see how having nothing to take my mind off it even a little will help.

 I also get that its so I dont get ""triggered"" by anything or talk with other drug abusers but those things dont really apply to my situation like it might for others addictions. I get my stuff online whenever and I dont know anyone addicted to any drug that I would even talk to. 

Im just really hesitant and worried as Im stuck in uncertainty of whether I should trust the therapist (Hes not a bad guy or anything Im just worried he may not be as familiar with more sever benzo addictions and hes admitted he isnt a psychiatrist and all so he doesnt have all the answers for me when it comes to my concerns with benzos.)

 I just dont want to uproot my life and go to virtually a prison for a month and then be rapidly taken off a drug and then sent home to have prolonged withdrawal symptoms for who knows how long.

 The whole reason Im addicted to benzos is because a probably well meaning doctor prescribed me fucking paxil when I was like 19 as an off label treatment for IBS (which since then ive found zero evidence its a treatment for that) and the reaction to the paxil gave me a severe depersonalization episodes that still persist to this day 8 years later and I basically have PTSD about them.

 I tried getting help for it way back then but doctors wouldnt prescribe any benzos for the panic attacks and I was at the edge of being unable to handle it any more so I started getting rc benzos which I knew beforehand were very likley to lead me to severe addiction but it was literally one of two options and the other options is suicide so fuck that. 

The benzos have bought me these last 6 or so years but obviously im far beyond the point of where I needed to stop and the side effects from the clonazolam have me as basically a hermit with sever anxiety issues that I can only barely edge off so I really want to come off benzos for life but I cannot take another risk of having another lifelong issue fucking with my mental health. it'll push me over that edge and its why Im so adamant about wanting to at least attempt a slow taper first but the wall Im at is he says its difficult to find a psychiatrist for me who'd be willing to take on that liability. 

I know Im going to get a lot of anecdotal responses which he warned me about (I already know how to treat anecdotes differently from actual evidence and all) but I need to know from some others who have gone through long tapers and from people who have gone the rehab route and what I should be expecting or if I need to give in and just trust in the doctor and hope my life isnt ruined more.

It also does not help that Im in the US and in one of the worst states for mental health or addiction treatment. Also the place is 12 step focused which raises some concerns and Ive had anecdotal stories of the place being strict on you having any reading materials other than a bible (Im an atheist) and other things that dont have any real logical reason behind them other than the outdated thoughts of how addicts should be treated. 

Sorry for the long ass post I just want to make sure I covered what I remembered fresh off the therapy session and looking forward to anyones stories of recovery or any advice or help. Pretty desperate at this point. 

Im open and willing to answer any and all questions that may help someone get a better idea of my options or anything Im being ignorant or unsure about.",5

But my brain has been burning and throbbing for days now - I thought my nose was starting to bleed from the pressure. Therefore, I don't wish this on anyone.

I thought depression and anxiety was bad. Benzo withdrawal aggravates those things beyond imagination. The derealization is unreal. I've never felt like this before nor could I have imagined it. That's why nobody understands. 

You're so lucky if you have a social support system. I feel like I am losing my mind. Also, I might have already lost some of my mind as this has been going on for months now. Despite neglecting everything in order to prioritize my diet and sleep and exercise and meditation.

If I am otherwise physically healthy and I solely have focussed on healing and it is this bad - honestly, benzos damage your brain and whole system without a doubt in my mind. I've never thought this would happen. And I'm tired of thinking and writing about it but I am overwhelmed by everything else in my life. 

How can you keep on living and functioning like this? I feel like I'm solely surviving and I don't see an end.

Having a very difficult time transferring off Xanax to go on another Benzo to taper,"To make a long story short my Doctor originally put me on 15mg Valium per day to start a taper coming off 2mg ox Xananax. At my next appointment I told him it wasn't working so he put me on 4mg Ativan daily. However it takes me 10-12mg per day of Ativan to keep me out of withdrawals. Its strange because If I was strictly  on xananax 2mg-2.5mg xanaax would be enough each day so I dont understand why its taking so much Ativan.  Going by the chart 4mg of Ativan should be enough but its not. My fear is I am going to tell my Doctor I need more meds and he is going to think I am pill shopping. I am a typical lookining middle age Businessman. I know he is not going to like raiaising my dose or changing again but, the truth is the truth. I can not get stable on less than 10mg Ativan but also dont want him to cut me off. Anyway, Any suggestions on how to make this transfer from xanax to another benzo smoother or advice on how to approach my Doctor wiht this problem again . THanks-",1

2021-06-29 12:10:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/oabfe1/its_worth_it/,It‚Äôs worth it,"Please bear with me, as I am terrible with being concise. I have PTSD and trauma-related anorexia going on ten years now with a couple of years break pre-pandemic. My anxiety monster took Covid and all the misinformation and ran with it‚Äî I wanted to believe anything other than what was actually happening. Shortly before this, I began to obsess over EMFs and continued to do so for about a year. I was barely online and totally isolated aside from my family. It‚Äôs taken me this long to get the vaccine and my second shot is this week. The point is I have valid mental issues based on irrational fears due to actual trauma. 

My only history with drugs was marijuana wayyyyyyy back in the day thanks to peer pressure, and I hadn‚Äôt even tried that when my mom gave me my first benzo. In her defense, I was literally going insane and she didn‚Äôt know what else to do. Looking back, I think she could‚Äôve done about a thousand other things but she didn‚Äôt know any better. (My dad was in the psych ward before I was. She‚Äôs been through a lot.)

I was admitted to the psych ward for the first time after this incident, and thus began my journey through doctors and facilities who treated me like an imbecilic slave and a fun brain to test. I was on all kinds of meds and was diagnosed all over the spectrum. I was a ‚Äúpsychotic freak‚Äù and I owned that label. 

Anyways, after multiple med cocktails, I was eventually prescribed Alprazolam at 1mg 3 times a day after the bazillionth breakdown.  (I spent about a year in a dark room watching the Office and shutting out the entire world after discovering my ex‚Äôs indiscriminate Craigslist hookup addiction.)

I ventured out again to finish school in my late 20‚Äôs, and this is when I made a friend who invited me to live with him as a roommate. It was a godsend and one of the happiest times in my life, just being accepted and feeling ‚Äònormal,‚Äô even though I was slowly fading away due to the combination of meds and the amount of alcohol consumption. In hindsight, I don‚Äôt think I was ever more than just someone to clean, pay rent, and eventually take advantage of. I wasn‚Äôt into him like that at all, so I went out with someone else and he came crying to my room asking me out. This tone deaf asshole I thought was my friend actually brought in his new fling to kick me out four years later when I stopped putting out. 

Now I‚Äôm back at moms with no degree, no job, nothing to be proud of and I‚Äôm 30-something with a messed up past and no idea how to be an adult. 

My point is that these benzos are no longer helping me. My relatively new psychiatrist (a year or so) switched me from Alprazolam to Clonazepam because of the longer half-life making that form generally easier to get off of. I had no idea anything other than Xanax/Alprazolam was even an option. I‚Äôm glad my old psych doc dumped me now. 

Basically, I‚Äôm tired of taking pills as bandaids for gaping wounds. I am now in therapy on my own accord, and life is not worth living if I cannot foresee a future outside this room. I was beginning to lose the one thing I had always held onto: Hope. 

I knew something had to change. It‚Äôs so hard when you‚Äôre under the influence of prescription medication to actually notice how indifferent you‚Äôve become. I did have permission to cut down from my psychiatrist when I felt able, but I never did. It happened _to me_ when I _forgot_ an entire dose and realized I was okay. 

Hell, I wasn‚Äôt only okay, I was _awake._ I was conversing and getting things done, noticing obvious things that I didn‚Äôt see before, and even feeling a bit joyful. I took the second dose because I was scared not to, but the next day I was like, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm ready for this.‚Äù

I think this subreddit will scoff mightily at my low dosage, but I am dependent. My dosage was/is 1mg of Clonazepam twice daily. It has been three weeks now of halving the pills and taking .5mg 3 times daily. Just this small decrease has changed my everyday life. I can no longer spend my days in front of my iPad playing mindless games while mindless entertainment displays on my iPhone. I _can‚Äôt_ be mindless anymore. That escape is gone for me, but I‚Äôm glad. It was uncomfortable at first because I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself and my intrusive thoughts. My distractions had to be more mindful, and therefore more creative. 

I‚Äôve started a video diary. I‚Äôve written a storyline. I‚Äôve started looking into ways to finish my AA degree, and I‚Äôm randomly  getting into carpentry and plumbing and electrical. I haven‚Äôt done more than fix my toilet and watch other people make things, but it‚Äôs so nice to have/maintain an interest that takes thought and creativity. I have more faith in myself, and I still have the hope I almost lost. I firmly believe that if I were to continue taking benzodiapines, I would waste away in this very room. It was a difficult transitional period, NGL, but worth every second. 

TL/DR: I am happier taking less benzodiazepines and plan to cut them out entirely. The grass is _actually_ greener on the other side, but we just can‚Äôt imagine or remember through the haze how vivid that green really is. Withdrawals are nothing compared to the emptiness of isolation, and for me they were spattered with moments of blissful awakening. I can say I am proud of my trajectory now, even if I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm headed. At least it‚Äôs somewhere.

Update: It seems I‚Äôve maintained .5mg 3x daily for 77 days. My life has changed significantly for the better. Even if the changes are small, they really do add up. There are rare days I take only two .5s, but this seems a bit more difficult to maintain with my issues. I know it‚Äôs worth it. If I could just schedule, like, a week or two without a crisis‚Ä¶ No? That‚Äôs just life? Okay.",5

I've been prescribed xanax 0.25 for two years, sometimes up to three times a day for a generalised anxiety disorder that is resistant to treatment. It's not much but I'm very sensitive to the molecule. I use sleep as an escape, and I liked xanax because it made me sleep so much. I could spend most of my day sleeping, and then have a full night.

I've been tapering down for some months (I was taking only 0.25 to sleep, and now I'm taking half a 0.25 pill in the morning, at 6pm and 0.25 at night because my anxiety is worsening even with therapy) and I can have full days. No naps. It's actually weird to have so much time in the day, most of the time I don't even know what to do because I'm not used to it anymore. 

I ended up in the psych ward because I would abuse my script, sometimes taking more than 4mg or more to sleep, or take opiates to ""nod"", sometimes combining both with the dangers it has. I'm out today and I want to stop my bullshit. Maybe it is a weird question, but how does anyone find a hobby or something they want to do? I'm out of the psych ward today and I know I will have to deal with full days again, and I have no idea how to.

Thanks a lot!",5

This has been bugging me for days now and I have my neuro-psych appointment this Friday. So basically I am on day 18 of Clonazepam and I want it out of my system now rather than longer and in months. What I have is sleep anxiety and I was an insomniac prior to K.

So my timeline is below:

June12-June 17 (6 days) : 1mg Klonopin

June 18-June 29 (12 days): 0.5 mg Klonopin per doctor's direction (no noticeable changes when I cut it down to 0.5mg)

June 30-July 1 (2 days): 0.5 mg Klonopin until the appointment

July 2: Doctor's appointment and judgment day if I stop or continue.

I don't feel any weird things at the moment except for constantly having the urge to pee at odd times during the night and waking up once or twice while sleeping but I am still able to go back to sleep so I guess it's okay. And not sure about constipation (sorry TMI) but I have a hard time passing in the past few weeks.

I practice routine and good sleeping hygiene with the help of my sleep doctor which I see separately.

I badly want to stop taking this medicine. I want to know your opinion if jumping from 0.5mg from 3 weeks of binge using will give me massive withdrawal symptoms? Or should I taper down to 0.25 to at least a week or 2?

I have been searching in this sub but not a lot of info about rapid taper within weeks or a very few months of use. I usually read years of use and abuse and their symptoms are hell. 

Please enlighten me.

PCP prescribed .25 clonazapam as needed 10 years ago due to middle of the night calls from work if I could not get back to sleep.

In addition, I have been taking 20mg of prozac daily since the 90s. for depression. In December 2020 I had a work related stressor that set off the anxiety / depression. Since December I have been taking .50 of clonazapam daily and literally only sleep soundly for about 2 hours and toss and turn the rest of the night.

I had non clue.about the benzo addiction until my Dr said I could CT back in Feb which was mistake as I started to jump thru my skim after 3 days.

Am at my wits end because the clonazapam has been the only constant drug in my system since December as I have been on 5 different antidepressants since then and none have helped an inkling. In addition, a.genomind test revealed that I have an a poor metabolizing liver function. I think the clonazapam has fucked me up.  If I don't take it, I will not sleep at all.
I am.anxious as shit needing to pace.around the house.
I have been reluctant to.feed the beast more clonzapam  inspire of my Drs advice to increase the dosage.

My life has been turned upside down and have no where to turn at this.point.  My brain feels.like has been on fire
With all of the ADS and Sleep.Meds that have not helped.

Sleep that night until the chemical leaves your body and you start withdrawing. The symptoms won't be that bad but they will creep up.  Eventually you'll lose sleep before any other effects really kick in.  Zzquill can be bought as chews with ashwagamdha(anti anxiety plant) in it which works wonders as well as puts you to sleep like a baby. When the serious withdrawal symptoms start hitting you, take a benadryl or 2 to counter and that will help immensely. Now, when things get to the worse part, your body is desperate for some benzo so pop a MUCH smaller amount than you used to and your body will go back to normal. 


I was taking 13 bars a day for months straight. Just stopped one day because it wasn't euphoric anymore more just a sleep aid at this point. The next few days I used zzzquill knowing I wasn't getting sleep. Know your body needs sleep for recovery. Don't drink caffeine and don't work out. Then I started to feel the withdrawing symptoms coming on heavy and that's when I took benadryl with Zzquill an hour or 2 before bed so you I know I felt okay. 

Next couple of days the withdrawal would hit back but the when the benadryl didn't do too well( I don't want to higher the dosage of benadryl) I'd take a small amount of benzo again. But then again thats days later. 


Eventually I didn't get withdrawal symptoms, I slept without medicine, and I could finally live a regular life only popping a bar on the weekend. Hope this helps. Dm me if anyone has questions",0

2 days go by after stopping everything without a problem. on the third night after I wake up and have an insane panic attack. Heart rate is all over the place.  A few days go by and this crazy anxiety and restlessness won't go away. 

I see my primary doc and he prescribes klonapin. I start taking two doses of 0.25 a day which helps immensely. about a week in I upped it to 3 doses of 0.25 a day. 

Long story short it's been a month I've been on this dose (with 4 or 5 nights upping it to 1mg total for the day because anxiety is still there.)

I want to get off this stuff asap for obvious reasons. I don't have a history of unmanageable anxiety. 

The psych i saw 2 days ago wants me to stay on a strict 0.25 3xday dose for the next two weeks then go back and see him and cut it down to 2 doses of 0.25 for two weeks. He then wants me to taper down to once a day at 0.25 for two weeks followed by total cessation. In the meantime to help with withdrawal, he prescribed me seroquel. He wants me to take 12.5mg of seroquel in morning and evening to ease the taper.

Does my psych have a good plan for me? A part of me feels like I can taper much faster and deal with a week of bad withdrawal before I'm in the clear given my low dose and short time being on it. 

Any advice out there on what I should do? this stuff is sapping the life outa me and I start a new job September 1st. I need to be off it asap.

(sorry for long post but I'm desperate. please can anyone help me figure this out?)",2

He has struggled with mental health and substance abuse for about a decade now and about 2 years ago he found research chemicals (clonazalam) and started taking the liquid drops. Eventually he was extremely addicted and was only taking them to stay alive. I grew up around my alcoholic mother and saw how that tore my family up and I have a lot of unresolved trauma because of that so going through that with an SO was really hard. In April of last year I found him a program and he successfully tapered off and was clean for almost a year. Being the daughter of an addict I knew it was probably coming but was relieved he told me he took them and we worked through it together. This was about 6 months ago. I found half an open bottle and 2 unopened bottles he just ordered I suppose in his bag. This time it‚Äôs called Bromazalam which I‚Äôm assuming is basically the same thing. I woke him up and asked him if he had bought benzos (I realize I probably should have waited till morning but again this is so extremely traumatic for me and I was scared and needed answers) he continued to deny and even tried to convince me I was reading it wrong a really it was bromantine. He finally fessed up and I said we would talk more in the morning but I don‚Äôt even know what to say or do anymore. I‚Äôm 23 and have no one to talk to and I‚Äôm scared with this relapse I won‚Äôt be able to care for myself at the sane time. I love him and at this time I am not thinking about leaving him because I want to be there to see him on the other side of this, I know he is capable of it. I just need advice on how to support him and maybe where I can find support for myself. Thank you so much to anyone reading, please ask any questions.

Prior to 348 days ago I‚Äôd been in heavy heavy active addiction for ~20 years. Hospitals, seizures, dui‚Äôs, rehabs, jails, all of the really shitty things that go with benzo abuse and all of them with an S on the end because the pattern repeats and escalates (in my experience). I think I can safely say the last year has been difficult for everyone. It‚Äôs been really hard to stay sober. Experiencing the events of the pandemic‚Ä¶the uncertainty and stress and worry and fear PLUS all of the things in my personal life‚Ä¶experiencing all of these things with a clear head and no escape button has been jarring and insane and terrifying. And lots of positives as well. BUT, I had to say goodbye to my dog yesterday (https://imgur.com/gallery/58r832Q). He was 13. He was my best friend. I knew it was coming. I thought I had another day. Yesterday was going to be the fun last day. Dog park. Cheeseburgers. Going to my mom‚Äôs house so my family could say goodbye. We only made it to the dog park and he had a seizure. I. Am. Gutted. This is a feeling I‚Äôve never felt in my adult life. Not that I haven‚Äôt been through things that provoke those feelings. Just in my entire adult life, I‚Äôve never been sober long enough to actually FEEL anything really. I feel so sad. My heart is broken and I can feel it. It hurts so much. It‚Äôs 3:30am and I‚Äôm laying here crying. 

He put up with so much shit from me over the years. The sloppy mess that I was. I have big feelings of guilt knowing the things he saw. He saw me go through so many seizures‚Ä¶I guess there‚Äôs some irony there. But he loved me and I loved him always. We also had road trips, beach vacations, dog parks, lazy days, walks in the rain, and almost 14 years of butt scratches. He was my best friend. It doesn‚Äôt feel real that when I go downstairs I won‚Äôt hear his collar jingle as he gets up to greet me. I loved him SO much. I am devastated. But I‚Äôm going to feel it because I‚Äôm not going to get high. I‚Äôm going to feel it all and sit with it and cry until I can‚Äôt anymore. But that what we‚Äôre supposed to do. We‚Äôre meant to feel these things, not escape them. The loss and grief and sadness are connected to the love and happiness that he brought in to my life. Eddy, you were the best of goodest dogs. You were my best friend. I am eternally grateful that you came in to my life in May of 2008. You will be missed by so many people. I love you so much. 

And then anyone reading this, I love you too. Get clean. Stay clean. Reach out. Ask for help. Feel all the feelings. I can‚Äôt say that it will for sure get better, but I know we don‚Äôt have to make anything worse. I believe in you‚Ä¶and Eddy would have too",25

First four days I was totally fine, then 5th day started having some mild withdrawal. For me, that means increased heart rate and blood pressure, some anxiety, and increased GI issues (all in the morning, I was pretty good throughout the day), but nothing intolerable. This continued on days 6, 7, and 8. I felt like it might be letting up a bit though, so I was stoked.

Yesterday was my birthday and I've been eating at home and really clean because of GI issues (I have IBS or so they say, it may be from the benzos, idk) but wanted to have Korean fried chicken. So I went out, and I did. Within an hour of eating I was a literal wreck.

I did some looking around and it looks like it's possible MSG can potentiate withdrawal symptoms??? WTF?

Without going into an entire drug-a-log of my chemical experiences, suffice it to say that I ended up becoming extraordinarily addicted to benzodiazepines among other things.  I‚Äôve had periods of sobriety as long as two years, chemical free.  

I‚Äôve come to a place now though where every day I am miserable and depressed and anxious, I am unable to complete simple tasks and require benzodiazepines every day all day in order to even function.

Obviously my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt want me to go because my only option is a six month fundamentalist Christian program that does not offer any kind of medication to detox and is downright hellish, although I made some amazing friends.",12

I have a question with regards to dependency and withdrawal. Over the past 6 weeks I have taken about 4-6mg of Xanax in one sitting about 6/7 times. In total I have taken around 36mg in 6 weeks but with relatively spaced out doses. In between this I have also taken 8mg worth of clonazepam 4 times spread out (2mg each sitting) and occasionally taken 3.75mg zopiclone 2 times when I have struggled sleeping.

My question is, is this enough to build up a physical dependence and develop withdrawal symptoms? I haven't taken a Xanax in 8 days but have taken 3.75mg zopiclone each night on Sunday and Monday, but now haven't taken any in 3 days. 

The only withdrawal symptom I had was insomnia on Sunday and Monday which is why I took the small doses of zopiclone, but I aren't sure if this is an actual physical symptom as I have struggled with insomnia frequently over the last 8 months. On Tuesday I drank alcohol so had a poor nights sleep but fell asleep quickly and on Wednesday I slept like a log naturally. Last night my sleep was ok too.

I'm just wondering if people think I'm out of the woods or if I can expect any further withdrawal symptoms and if people feel as though I had taken enough/often enough to become physically dependant at all. I also wasnt sure if there was any cross dependence between benzos and zopiclone which is why I kept the zopiclone doses so small but they seemed to do the job.

Thanks in advance for your help.",2

I am scared.  I have awful thoughts.  I'm not close to THE drastic measure, but I think about it a lot.
Does anyone have this, such an all encompassing hopelessness as I do?  How do/did you cope?  I feel so alone even with people (and I can barely handle being around anyone with my fabulous agoraphobia and general panic, depression's sidekicks).

Here‚Äôs how much I was taking:

-It started out as one .25mg pill daily when the pandemic started. 
-A few months before a flight my tolerance increased and I needed one .5mg pill daily. 
-A week before the flight the insomnia started and I began taking .5mg in the morning and .5 at night. 
-The day of my flight and entire trip is really hazy and I think I was taking 1-2mg daily spread out throughout the day because I didn‚Äôt want to experience rebound anxiety and insomnia was so bad at night. 
-The flight home I was losing my shit and I think I took around 3mg just to be calm enough to board the plane but I don‚Äôt really remember. 

Basically I have no freaking idea how much Xanax I was taking on that trip so I don‚Äôt know if I am tapering correctly and I am so scared I‚Äôm going to get a seizure or have a massive uncontrollable panic attack out or no where or something. 

Yesterday was the day after I got home from the flight and I took: . 75mg in morning, .5mg in afternoon, and .5mg in evening. Felt generally okay but sorta manic but manageable.

Today I am going to taking the same regimen but I am really worried that I am doing it wrong and the anxiety about it is making me wonder if it‚Äôs rebound or just anxiety about getting myself in this situation without any medical support.

All of my care providers do not have harm reduction knowledge and general understanding of benzodiazepines to know how to address my concerns.

I know it‚Äôs preferable to seek medical help on this type of an issue but I would like to hear from other people who have been through this and how they recovered so I can feel a sense of hope.
Do you think this taper schedule looks correct for the usage I‚Äôve had 

Any insight or personal experience is welcomed because I feel like I‚Äôm in this alone right now.

TL;DR: took .25mg daily for over a year, then .5mg daily for a few months, then .5mg twice daily for a few weeks, then 1-2mg daily for a few days, and over 3 mg on one day. Now I want to taper but I don‚Äôt know how much and in what increments. Doctors/pharmacists/psychiatrists have been unhelpful and I am looking for some sort of success stories and reassurance mostly that I will be okay and not die from WD or panic massively if I taper wrong at this dose.

I have been using valium recreationally for about 2-3 years, in the beginning sporadically for sleep or plain fun... last year and a half daily, started with 10 mg, 6 months later 15mg,etc... 4 months ago I was at about 25-30 mg a day and I decided to start tapering. The taper has been somewhat succesfull, I'm at 15mg now, the only problem I had was mood-issues, heavy depression, lethargia, etc...  this was all pretty manageble by supplementing with low doses of Kratom. Because I dont want to exchange one habit for another I have been extremely qautious with my Kratom use, low doses and regular tolerance-breaks.

I have noticed that whenever I do a t-break, I get terribly depressed and lethargic, the reason why I started using K in the first place was to combat the depression I had from the benzo-taper.... 

So here is my question  :) does anyone have any experience with  5-htp as a mood enhancer for low serotonine because of t-breaks or benzo-taper in general ?

Yesterday I had my 2nd seizure. I've been on and off benzos the last 6 months, usually tapering very low doses of Xanax and then relapse and starting abusing it. So periods with minimal doses like 0.12/25 for 10 days eg, then a week of 1mg/day etc

The last month Ive been of Flualprazolam. Used almost in Xanax analogy = 3mg/day or in Flualprazolam analogy 1,5mg. Starting tapering at 1.5mg xanax analogy coz I was running out soon, 2nd day 1.3mg, 3rd day 1.0mg. Had a seizure for 1,5 minute last night, my parents found me seizing on the computer desk and didn't remember anything. I just remember waking up with terrible nausea and 1 hour later I suspected I had one because  I've had a bitten tongue and sore muscles in the legs, they didn't tell me, but eventually they did.

I used DCK (deschloroketamine), a research chemical almost the same as Ketamine. I read yesterday that low doses of Ketamine cause a glutamate storm. I've been taking it for 5 days consecutively at 15mg (that would be around 40mg of Ketamine -low dose-). Put in the mix the heatstroke I faced yesterday, almost 41¬∞C, couldn't ""breathe"" from hot all day and went for fast walking while sweating and not enough fluids.

Do you think that I tapered too fast by lowering my dosage in half and start from there or that because of the loooong half-life life of DCK the glutamate storm contributed to seizure with the low gaba state ? Today I continued the taper with 0.25mg Flualprazolam x 2/day and taper off completely in 10 days. Can't express how anxious I am until the taper and the next week after tapering off ends.

Instead of tapering maybe getting to a doctor and speaking to take Carbamazepine for 1-2 weeks instead of flualprazolam ? The pellets are so tinny so probably an uneven cut could occur in lower dosage. No chance I'm getting prescribed again benzos. All doctors have access to my online medical history and saw the ER admittance for ""seizure because of abruptly stopping benzos"".",1

It took three weeks to drop from 14mg to 4mg, then a further week to drop to 3mg. Feeling fine with the help of L'theanine, vitamin b3 and sleep.

Making 0.5mg drops every 4 days or so. 

I have an operation tomorrow and they're giving me Midizolam (a benzo) and Proponol for anasthesia.. 

Will this set me back? Very short half life on this one. They might also use Triazolam (I'd have gone mad for this recreationally before my taper.) I have a choice haha. 

What do you guys think?

I had no prior history with benzos before that point. I began with .5mg of Ativan per day, then after a few months I started experiencing interdose withdrawal (anxiety, tremors, insomnia) so my doctor switched me over to 5mg of Valium per day instead. I've been tapering very carefully at the rate of .05mg every two weeks and am currently at at 2.4mg per day. It's been smooth sailing until recently. 

I've been getting these unbearable pain symptoms the last month or two and I'm not sure if they're benzo related. Mainly because I haven't been experiencing heightened anxiety or insomnia-- which were the telltale signs that I'd become physically dependent in the first place. 

My sinuses feel extremely inflamed to the point that I can feel my pulse beating in my face. I also get terrible jaw pain. I'm not noticing any grinding, but the muscles where my lower and upper jaw meet feel locked up and I can only open my mouth about 2 inches max. Then there's a severe tension headache that affects my temples, eyebrow area, and the base of my skull. My muscles in my neck and shoulders also totally lock up and I often get spasms as well.  

I also have gabapentin that I reserve for *that* time of the month because I've always gotten really bad insomnia during that time. I only take 100mg once before bed 2-3 days in a row (most people are prescribed at least 300mg 3 times per day bare minimum, so this is a very low dose).  I've only recently started wondering if its the gabapentin that is causing rebound symptoms and im just especially sensitive at this point in my taper. But it's currently been 5 days since I last had gabapentin and I'm still experiencing symptoms. Dealing with all of this during a 95¬∞ heatwave and no air conditioning has been hell on earth. 

Do these symptoms sound withdrawal related to you guys or could something else be going on? Thank you guys for any input you can give.",2

I started pregabalin with my psychiatrist prescribing it for helping with my valium wd and in particular with my most debilitating symptom: burning brain feeling with an inability to do intellectual effort for 20 minutes without feeling slammed.

I am holding my Valium (2.5mg) dosage for more than 5 months and then I started pregabalin.

I tried it for 10 days from 50mg to 100mg and decided to stop because it wasn't helping with my ""overheating""/""burning brain"" symptom, despite of helping me with my OCD.

The last few days of the 10 days window I was taking 100mg of pregabalin. On day 11 I didn't took any and it was normal, had some difficult to sleep but only due to nasal congestion.

On day 12, I didn't take any until I tried to sleep: I wasn't getting asleep, kinda anxious, and with strange spasms when I was close to sleeping, but I was unable to fall asleep.

It was 2 AM when I gave up and took 50mg of pregabalin and then needed to eat something... after a while I slept.

I wasn't having any sleep issues before this. Will I need to taper pregabalin following the 5% or 10% rule given this episode of insomnia?

I don't want to be hooked on one more drug that didn't help me to get functional. I don't want to do a long taper only because I tried for a few days.

Can I CT/stop or will I face this dependency issues for weeks if I don't taper slowly?

Edit: Maybe it's worth mentioning that I take 125mg of sertraline. Am I risking seizures if I stop taking pregabalin from now on?",1

I was prescribed very high doses of them (along with other meds) for a decade and my life pretty much imploded on every level from this cocktail of psych meds. I was able to get off the other scripts but klonopin was always my Achilles heel. I tried many times to get off of them and each time, I failed, once spending months curled up in the fetal position under my desk after getting myself sober. I blacked out for most of my 20's because of these pills. I'm past the point of feeling angry about it, feeling angry with psychiatrists, and generally looking for someone to blame. 

I feel like a lot of what needs to be said about addiction, that isn't said, is what happens after weaning off of whatever your substance of choice is. Sobriety isn't the end of the road. You aren't suddenly cured because you're sober. I've now had to face all of the various reasons WHY I became so dependent on sedating myself. 2 years out of my addiction, I still have severe anxiety to the point where it's difficult to be around people. I have days where I feel like I'm just a masochist for allowing myself to suffer like this. I guess I'm just scared. 

I'm making some progress in therapy with my anxiety but it's at a snail's pace. I used to be an incredible writer before my addiction and during my addiction as well. Post addiction, it's a strain for me to write anything creative anymore. My mind just feels constantly backed up. I feel emotionally constipated and I can't get past the fear for any meaningful length of time so I can connect to the other emotions that inspire me to write. Being sedated gave me the confidence to just let the thoughts flow and it really did wonders for my writing. I'm wondering if anyone else has any issues with creativity because of the constant fear that comes with not feeling an unnatural level of relaxation anymore? Does the fear as well as the mental exhaustion ever fully go away? Can anyone relate to this? Thanks for listening.",23

I already consulted to my psychiatrist and we agreed to taper down to half a tablet of 0.5 mg (500 mcg) a day before sleeping.

---

I ran out of Alprazolam and took it as to how it was prescribed by my psych. I can't continue with taking it since anxiolytics are too expensive here in my country. 

I'm 23 M, I started taking it April 14, my last dose was June 19 and 0.5 mg (500 mcg). I got diagnosed with Anxiety and Panic Disorder last March.

It's Day 2 of not taking it, and I don't know if I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I've been going to sleep with my mind racing with random thoughts. I can fall asleep after quite sometime but I'd always wake up and my brain does this ""constant checking"" if everything's alright. I'm waking up with my hands and feet feeling cold or light. My body sends me signals to wake up and I feel like it's gonna explode due to lots of energy. Basically I'm waking up feeling restless but my sleep doesn't feel satisfying. When resting, I feel like my body's too light and I feel the need to be constantly moving.

My eyes would sometimes adjust and would suddenly become sensitive to light. Staring at my phone screen while typing this took several pauses as it adjusts to the light despite having it to the lowest brightness. My left eye/sclera had gone pink due to the blood vessels.

I'm having anxiety attacks to the roof too. Maybe a rebound?

I already sent a text message to my psych regarding this matter, though I've read that suddenly not taking it would experience symptoms 24-48 hours.

I just wish to sleep normally and peacefully the same way when I'm having it. Thanks for reading.",12

I've been on clonazepam for panic attacks associated with GAD for over a year. I went down from 1 mg clonazepam a day to like 1/20 mg over the past 5 months since the panic attacks aren't as frequent now and it makes me too sleepy. Have gotten lightheadedness, pounding heart, panic attacks, insomnia, random sleepiness, sweating, and weirdly, Bell's palsy. The worst of the Bell's palsy thing only lasted a couple of weeks.

All the symptoms I listed have mostly subsided except the right side of my face feels slightly weak and numb for a few days whenever I lower the dose. I'm at the point where my psychiatrist is telling me to skip doses and like clockwork my face feels all weird and twitchy within the next day. If I wasn't getting this one symptom, I imagine I could just stop the clonazepam and never worry about it again.

I already talked to a non-psych doctor and was on prednisone for the Bell's palsy thing a few months back, so not much else I can do. I've mentioned it to my psych as well. Just wondering if anyone else got this and if it went away for you eventually? I know to take anecdotes with a grain of salt. Mostly just venting and wondering if other people have struggled with similar stuff. Hope anyone reading this is doing well.",2

2021-06-21 19:31:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/o58o3o/my_success_story/,My Success Story,"My success story from benzo buddies: 

My story with benzodiazepines begins in the fall of 2010. I took a job as an English teacher a year after graduating college. During that first year, I progressively started sleeping worse and worse because of the severe anxiety and stress I was feeling about teaching. I disliked the public speaking a great deal and constantly worried about what students and my colleagues thought of me. I went to my general practitioner, and he put me on Ambien. It worked for a little while, but then I started noticing I was taking more and more to fall asleep, and I was staying up longer and longer after taking it and feeling very weird. I would wake up in the morning and find that I was 20 more pages into a book and hadn‚Äôt remembered reading it, and I also had bizarre journal entries from that time period. I think taking the ambien turned into abuse during that first school year. I was also drinking a lot during that time period. My sleep was still basically garbage despite the ambien. I persevered through my first year and slept slightly better over the summer, but when my second year started, the same sleep issues resumed, and I wanted to quit my job. In hindsight, I probably should have, as my body was rejecting the situation.  


As a last resort, I went to a sleep doctor, who put me on .5 milligrams of Klonopin. I started sleeping better immediately and even felt more confident at work. During my third year, I was doing pretty well at my job, and that continued through year five. Every year, from 2011 to 2015, I would take .5 milligrams of Klonopin only on week nights, and generally, I was binge drinking every Friday night. Every summer, I would completely stop taking the Klonopin cold turkey. It wasn‚Äôt until the summer of 2014 where I first noticed having uncomfortable intrusive thoughts that went away right when I started taking meds again in the fall. I took some Klonopin sporadically during the 2015-2016 school year, but I was mostly off it by then because I‚Äôd read about the risk of dementia. I also distinctly remember reading about people having problems coming off these meds and thinking, No way, it‚Äôs not possible. I didn‚Äôt really have any major issues quitting cold turkey all the times I did.  


I had one good year of teaching (2016-2017) off all medications. I attribute this to the students I had that year and the friend circle that I had at work. Also, during that year, my wife and I had our daughter and I got to take a month off. I took care of my daughter, alone, during the day, for one full month. However, when the 2017-2018 school year started, I started having all the same anxiety I had remembered from my first year of teaching; however, my sleep wasn‚Äôt terrible. I started having migraines, and I dreaded going to work. I think I was also exhausted and not taking care of myself because of our daughter, graduate school, and the strenuous teaching job. I started getting lightheaded at work when I had to lecture. I started feeling like my heart was beating too fast, and I had to grab desks while walking up and down the rows and handing out graded work. Suddenly, the students were no longer on my side, I think mostly because I was growing more and more miserable and they could tell. At the beginning of January 2018, I went back to my general practitioner and asked for Klonopin to help me cope. I figured it worked once, and it could work again. Biggest mistake of my life!  


I started taking .125 milligrams in the morning and another .125 milligrams before my seventh period class, which was the period I dreaded most. I did that from early January 2018 to March 21st, 2018. I was intentionally taking what I thought was a low dose because I was aware of the risks. During that time period, I started noticing that I was waking precisely between 4 and 5 every day and I could not fall back asleep. Also, it was during this time period that I noticed the interdose withdrawal. I felt horrible in the shower if I didn‚Äôt take the Klonopin prior to getting in every morning. I would also not take the meds over the weekend. It was sometime in February 2018 that I knew something was seriously wrong when I did not take a dose over the weekend. My wife and daughter were gone, and I tried to sit down to watch some TV while eating, and I felt like I was going insane. Complete internal restlessness and agitation. It is very hard to describe because I‚Äôd never felt anything like that before. It was the beginning stages of akathisia. I remember taking my dog out in the snow and walking her up and down the street. Even at that moment, I didn‚Äôt realize it was the meds completely causing it. I kept blaming work. Then that Sunday night, I remember bawling to my wife for no reason and getting really mad at her. I had never cried like that before.  


When I quit the meds completely (.25 milligrams of Klonopin, cold turkey), it took about two days and I knew I was in a lot of trouble. Feelings of psychosis. Pacing all over the house having panic attacks because I thought I‚Äôd lost my mind. No appetite. Besides the feelings of I‚Äôd lost my mind, the next noticeable symptom was insomnia. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all until a good month and a half off. With that, I will break down the symptoms I had and when.  


Insomnia: Like I said, I didn‚Äôt sleep until the first month and a half off the meds. I was having zero nights of sleep for a very long time, and I have no idea how I kept functioning at work in the early stages off the meds. Usually I‚Äôd stay up all night and then about a half hour before the alarm, I‚Äôd fall asleep for like twenty minutes. Then from about 2.5 to 5 I slept okay, but when the next year of school started (2018-2019), I went back to about 2 hours a night. During that time period, I‚Äôd use guided meditation to put me to sleep, and it would usually keep me asleep for a couple hours at the beginning of the night and then I‚Äôd be up most of the rest of the night. From months 12 to 24, my sleep slowly improved. I got to the point where I could take naps consistently again around month 24 when the COVID pandemic started. Then I noticed during month 29, when my 2020-2021 school year was starting, I was sleeping through the night despite my job and taking naps after work. I‚Äôm sleeping about 6 to 7 hours a night now, and working out during the day seems to really help me sleep better too. I can‚Äôt sleep past 6 or 7 o‚Äôclock most weekend days, and I could before withdrawal occurred, but that might just be due to aging. Maybe the ability to sleep in will come back too. Who knows. I can tell you that I‚Äôm still pretty dog tired most days even though I‚Äôm sleeping a lot better. I‚Äôm just thankful I‚Äôm getting some sleep again.  


Akathisia: I know that this has been my absolute worst symptom. I know that it‚Äôs what created the horrifying depression that made me afraid to be alone, and on the flip side, it also created the horrible intrusive thoughts and urges that made me scared to be around any people at all. Once I initially got my sleep back at around 2.5 months, I fell into a deep depression. It was like nothing I‚Äôd ever experienced before. I remember the night it really started. I had just completed a catering gig, and I got home late and went to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night with the worst depression and mental agitation I‚Äôd ever experienced and it was like something was pulling me to end my life against my will. I then woke up my wife asking to be institutionalized, and I cried and had a panic attack. It eventually passed, but I would have an episode like this probably a few times a month for probably the first 12-18 months. I never wanted to die at any point, it just felt like something was trying to force me to.  


From months 2.5 to about month 12, I had to be walking constantly to keep my sanity. Also, when I was at home, I couldn‚Äôt be left alone. I developed monophobia, and I was completely scared to be by myself. I had to accompany my wife everywhere during the first year, and my parents constantly had to drive from their house an hour and half away and stay for extended periods of time. I was afraid to park in my garage because of frightening intrusive thoughts I was having, so I just parked in front of my house. Also, the horrible depression and akathisia is a major reason I went right on working because days at home were a million times worse than being at work. It‚Äôs funny because what put me on benzos (work) I now felt like I had to be at every day to keep my sanity.  


After the really bad depression started to fade from months 12-18, I started noticing horrible intrusive thoughts and urges and agitation around others. I had horrible anger for no reason. It was toward everybody, but particularly bad toward my family. It was then torture to be inside my home at all. I won‚Äôt go into any of the details. I had to avoid being home as much as possible. Again, these symptoms have been linked to mental akathisia. But these symptoms have been the absolute worst and complete and utter torture. Nobody would understand it unless they experienced it. It was the benzo the entire time. These thoughts and urges and feelings continue to fade to this day. They become less and less intense each month. Please refer to this thread to understand what I‚Äôm talking about.  


[http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php?topic=64504.0](http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php?topic=64504.0)  


Sensitivity to Everything: For the longest time, I couldn‚Äôt watch any TV, movies, or read any books. Everything brought on horror and dread and would kick up the akathisia-related symptoms I just described. I remember at one point I couldn‚Äôt even watch the Toy Story 4 trailer. I eventually watched it and felt horrible. Any mention of anything even remotely violent or anything to do with mental health at all, made me feel complete and utter horror for so long too. Even seeing the cover of a horror book like The Shining, for example, brought on severe fear based on the symptoms I was having.This symptom has slowly faded, and I can watch TV again and enjoy shows and movies for the most part. I can also read any type of book again.  


Also, early on, I was really sensitive to sound. I remember listening to guided meditations to help me fall asleep in the first year, and when the guide would stop and then start talking again, it would frighten and jar me awake.  


Anhedonia: I was unable to feel pleasure throughout most of the process. I remember I had big plans in the summer of 2018 to buy a new guitar. I had been saving for a while and planned on trading some of my old guitars in. Of course I ended up doing this about 3 months into withdrawal, and I remember what my wife said distinctly: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even excited about this.‚Äù I remember telling her ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù I had lost the feeling of pleasure one gets when buying a new item or playing a video game or reading a book or watching a ballgame. Most of my interests completely disappeared and my life turned into watching benzo videos, calling other people going through benzo withdrawal, and walking non-stop. Small purchases for enjoyment lost all value to me. I derived little to no pleasure hanging out with people, I just did it to get through the days and distract myself. However, my interests have come back for the most part and I‚Äôm looking forward to watching shows again and looking forward to hanging out with people and the weekend. Looking forward to plans feels very good.  


Derealization and Depersonalization: I had this pretty bad from the outset and started noticing that it was fading probably around 24 months off the meds. The first thing I noticed was looking at a mountain range that was very close to my house. The sky and mountain range seemed like a painting to me. It was very bizarre. Also, I particularly remember looking at my daughter and thinking she‚Äôs not my daughter. This isn't my real life. In another eerie instance, I remember driving through the campus I graduated college from in the winter of 2019 and thinking this isn‚Äôt where I went to school. It was very eerie and uncomfortable. All my past memories didn‚Äôt feel like they were mine even though I still remembered them. Through most of the withdrawal, I didn‚Äôt feel any human connection with other people as well. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, hardly at all, and I had to pretend I was fine every time I did, which was incredibly difficult. On top of all this, and I believe this symptom is connected to derealization, every time I looked in the mirror it was like I couldn‚Äôt recognize myself. It was like a blurred, distorted image of me. Just utter torture. Most of this has gone away, but I still occasionally get the sensation that what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt my real life like when I‚Äôm at work or home, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as it once was.  


Burning Skin: This was my worst physical symptom. I had burning in my face, around my cheeks, mouth, eyes, and nose. It felt like I had frostbite on my face. Most of my nerve burning was in my left calf, but I would get it in other places too like my ears and stomach and arms and my right leg. It would come and go in those places and seemed worse when stressed. It seemed to get worse when the mental symptoms would get worse too, so I‚Äôm sure it was all tied together. I still have this to some extent, but it does not bother me much at all anymore, and it keeps lessening the more time goes on.  


Head Pain and Pressure: I had a lot of weird pain in the front of my head most of the time. It often felt like there was a brick in my frontal lobe or pressure in my frontal lobe, and it seemed to coincide with the feelings of losing my mind. So when the head pressure in the front of my head was bad that also meant my mental symptoms were bad. I guess this is the brain trying to heal itself.  


Vision Issues: My vision became blurry the moment I quit cold turkey. It felt like there was a veil between me and the world for a long time, and again, I feel that was associated with derealization. Once the veil lifted a bit, I noticed it was just blurry vision that would get worse when I would get stressed out. It seems to be resolving itself in time as well. I‚Äôm finally able to really focus on people‚Äôs facial features again and notice what they really look like. It was so blurry for so long.  


Ear Stuff: I had a lot of burning in my ears, and I still have it from time to time. Also, I sometimes had a sensation that my ears were filled with water. That went away.  


Other symptoms: Early on (first four months), I had the sensation my joints were trying to bend the wrong way. That went away. I think it was associated with akathisia and having restless limbs. I would occasionally get restless limbs while lying in bed. I had a lot of morning anxiety in the first year to year and a half off where I would have butterflies in my stomach. I had some rib cage pain off and on and some costochondritis in my chest. I still get the sensation in my chest like muscles are being pulled apart when I‚Äôm stressed. Tons of crying spells because of the symptoms and the torment. Those could be helpful at times. I still get mild muscle spasms that aren‚Äôt that bothersome. I know it‚Äôs from the benzo.  


Residual Stuff (may or may not be benzo related): I‚Äôm still dealing with a lot of fatigue, and I‚Äôm still very sensitive to stress. Some days when I push myself too hard and do too much, my vision still gets really blurry and the fatigue/exhaustion behind the eyes can get very bad and my head feels off; however, it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as the 24/7 suffering I experienced for so long. Also, I contracted COVID about a year after COVID became a fixture of our lives and went through a wave that resolved after a few weeks, again, showing I‚Äôm sensitive to stress. I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm still going to get waves when I‚Äôm stressed for a little while. I‚Äôm hoping that stops completely in the future. I may have to do some extensive trial and error with lifestyle, diet, etc, to improve said conditions, or I may just need more time.  


Benzo withdrawal started on March 21st, 2018. For me it has been mental torture the entire time because of the akithisia-related symptoms. My sleep started coming back in earnest at 24 months off, and I started feeling like the mental symptoms were improving by about 30 months off. By 36 months off, I started feeling fairly normal most days besides the residual symptoms I described. I‚Äôm 38 months off as I post this.  


All in all, I was able to keep my life in order through all this over the past three years. I kept my teaching job and then applied for a less stressful library job and moved, with my family, back to my hometown to be closer to my parents to finish healing at about 14 months off. I was able to sell and buy a new house. I finished my master‚Äôs degree in Creative Writing. But most importantly, my family stayed together, and my daughter is growing up into a kind and wonderful person. She is four now.  


I was able to release two albums, the first album completely about acute withdrawal and the other about the aftermath of withdrawal and trying to get better.  


The first album about acute withdrawal is entitled Get Well and can be found here:

I really hope these albums could potentially help people going through this, particularly Get Well. You can listen for free with all these links.  


There are a lot of people I want to thank from the forum and lots of people I met in Facebook groups too.  


I want to start by thanking now-power who I reached out to early on after finding his previously mentioned thread about similar, disturbing symptoms. I reached out on a whim, not knowing if he‚Äôd ever respond to my message but he did. We started a correspondence that really helped me see that the symptoms were in fact withdrawal symptoms and nothing else. If not for his thread and correspondence, I‚Äôm not sure I would have made it.  


I also want to thank hearsaybenz for working on the two benzo-related albums with me and making them all they could be. By finding each other on this forum, we became friends working on music and also discussing the plight that has been benzo withdrawal. I look forward to our continued friendship in the future.  


And another friend I want to thank is Tom6418. We spoke a lot while going through this at the same time. You were tapering and I went cold turkey, but we did have a lot of similar symptoms that we could relate about. I appreciate all those conversations we had about how life used to be before the injury.  


Another friend I want to thank is FakeItTilYouMakeIt. You really helped me out during the early part of acute. I remember talking to you every day, while I paced around my classroom during my prep period. Thank you for doing that. It helped me survive.  


I also need to thank Siggy and Theway2 for talking with me so much during this process as well. You really helped me with the insomnia part of all this.  


Other people that helped me a lot along the way include Misty93, groovejuice, t1d, jimmythesaintny, Lesliej, BrainOnFire, and probably another handful of people who I met in Facebook groups who assured me it was benzo withdrawal and that I just needed to survive until it was over. There were also a ton of people on benzo buddies I interacted with a lot in threads that were very helpful as well.  


Other thoughts:  
1. Every single day I was going through this, I almost never believed it could only be from the meds. I always believed it was some other mental illness I had picked up or my previous symptoms coming back. I blamed it on postpartum depression in men, testosterone levels, diet, my family, my job, where I lived. I almost went on other meds several times, but my instincts after what happened with the benzos always told me no, along with all the other people I was talking to who had been through this journey. I‚Äôm really glad I didn‚Äôt take other meds. I feel like that would have been the definition of insanity.  


2. I never believed I would heal when I was feeling bad, I only believed I would heal when I had brief windows. Also, when in the depths of hell, the torment is so all encompassing, there is nothing else I could think about. People told me to leave the forum and distract and to leave Facebook groups. There was no way I was going to be able to do so. I know some people are able to do it, but the groups were my constant distraction when feeling terrible. I was talking to someone about my condition 24/7 for nearly 2.5 years because without the constant reassurance, I don‚Äôt think I would have made it. Massive thank you to anyone who took the brunt of reassuring me over and over again.  


3. Supplements: I tried at least 20 to 30 supplements while going through this and none of them touched any of the symptoms. I don‚Äôt think any really made me worse except fish oil, which I tried at about a year off, and my insomnia got terrible for a few nights (zero hours). I tried vitamin d3, vitamin C, magnesium, CBD oil, zinc, multivitamins, Sam-E, lithium orotate, 5-HTP, probiotics, and so on. I even tried the gingko protocol from a benzo buddies thread. I tried herbal tea blends from my herbalist friend. I took lion‚Äôs mane and nutritional yeast and various b vitamins. The only thing that helped even slightly was a .3 milligram tablet of herbatonin, which did occasionally help with sleep as I got further along. Also, during withdrawal, I sometimes would take a half a tablet of a Unisom antihistamine to help with sleep, and it did seem to help me get a little sleep. All in all, I wasted a ton of money on supplements. It‚Äôs impossible to know what helped me, what hurt me, and what did nothing for benzo healing, but none brought any acute benefits besides the aforementioned sleep aids.  


4. Alcohol: At about a month off, before I knew much about all this, I went out with my buddies and had some drinks. Then about a month later, at two months off, I had a beer at a concert and then a week later, I indulged in one more drink at a going-away party. This was June 2018. That‚Äôs really when shit hit the fan for me. While I was dealing with some very bad insomnia early on, I was feeling like I was healing at about two months off because my sleep had gotten better. However, after that drink at the going away party, right at the beginning of my summer vacation, things got very bad. Depression was through the roof at that point. While I can‚Äôt say that it wouldn‚Äôt have happened for sure without the drinks, I would just avoid drinking while healing. No point in ruining progress for one drink. I haven‚Äôt had any alcohol since June 6th, 2018. Believe me, based on my past history with drinking, it would take immense suffering for me to quit it completely, and this was immense suffering.  


5. Treat it like a brain injury: I would try to do things that help treat a brain injury or a nervous system injury like exercising as much as you can. I know some people develop exercise intolerance, but I would figure out a way to exercise each day, even if just a little bit. I think in the late stages of healing, exercise helped me finish faster. I would also find diets that treat brain injuries and nervous system injuries and figure out nutrients that you might be lacking that help with brain and nervous system health. I wouldn‚Äôt treat yourself for depression or anxiety or things of that nature by taking more pills. Treat it as a brain injury and those other things will resolve, assuming they are from the medication injury.  


6. I was a nuisance on this forum: I know that I was a massive nuisance on this forum and posted about the same things over and over again. I know that I annoyed many people and that many people told me to get professional help when posting about my primary issues. I sort of invited others to get mad at me with the number of repetitive posts I made. Many told me to try meds. Many told me to leave the forum. And I‚Äôm really glad that I didn‚Äôt do any of those things. I just want to thank anybody who gave me unconditional support here despite my repetitive posts.  


7. It‚Äôs true that people leave this forum when they start to feel better. This is something I never believed as I looked at member‚Äôs profiles who hadn‚Äôt posted in years but did not write a success story. I think people just get better enough to move on and don‚Äôt want to think about this anymore. I went from being on Benzo Buddies nearly every moment of the day to maybe ten minutes a day in about a three-month timespan. Very few people remain from when I was at my worst and that includes people who were suffering at the same time as me and also people who were already healed who were helping out a ton. Many of the people who were sick at the same time as me did not write a success story though, and many stopped talking to me abruptly once they got better.  


8. Therapy: My best suggestion would be to find a benzo-wise therapist and see that person as you heal. If you cannot find a benzo-wise therapist, you are better off talking to other people who have gone through the horrible ordeal themselves. Therapists who know nothing about this will not be able to help you and will likely gaslight you. I was able to find two great therapists while going through this who did believe me and helped me out. However, I did go through about three other therapists who did not believe me, and actually made me feel much worse. One of them recommended exposure therapy for the akathisia-related symptoms I described and that was a very bad idea. Exposure therapy will not work for OCD symptoms that are chemical.  


9. Kindling and cold turkey: I think I‚Äôm a worst-case scenario story on benzo buddies because I was repeatedly kindled and repeatedly quit cold turkey. I should have reinstated and done a liquid-based taper after the bad reaction in 2018, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. I would always, always taper getting off these meds, and once you do successfully, do not go back on them. I believe the repeated starts and stops of these meds made my nervous system incredibly fragile.  


10. Time: Time is super important. When I spoke with healed people in moments of desperation (which was daily), I never believed them when they said time was the most critical factor. I just kept seeking shortcuts. I kept saying I can¬ít go on like this for another 6 months. But I did. I had to for my family. And all the healed people were correct. It just slowly started to fade over time. And all the symptoms dropping off were very subtle. It wasn‚Äôt magically healing overnight in my case, just glacially noticing that symptoms were dropping off, until all of a sudden the days weren‚Äôt complete torture every moment.

I'm weighing my options right now to go off of klonopin this summer. (0.5 klonopin everyday for 6 years)  I have a job that kind of depends on me more than I'd like but a very understanding boss, that being said, missing work is a huge concern of mine because it is a small business with only one other employee. These are the pros and cons of a fast taper at a detox center vs a slower taper through my psychiatrist:

detox center: FAST! I could get the worst of it over with in a safe environment. would only miss a week or two of work hopefully? (more predictable) I would be in the care of doctors and feel safe about any medical issues i might run into, would feel less like i'm doing this on my own. Withdrawal will be REALLY shitty though. Like I'm prepared to feel absolutely unbearably bad. Also could be costly depending on insurance. 

slow at home taper: SLOW, maybe too slow. Will have bad days where I wont be able to work, and I have no idea how many of those there will be, really unpredictable which gives me a lot of anxiety. I would be constantly stressed about if i'm feeling good enough to work, my boss is understanding but maybe not understanding enough to put up with me needing to be off of so much work. BUT withdrawal symptoms would not be as horrible, just drawn out.

I'd like to hear from people who've experienced either of these options. The detox center sounds enticing because of the short term and the ability to plan for it, but are there risks that I'm not taking into account? What do you prefer and why? The slow taper and it's unpredictable timeline stresses me out, but might it be better for me health wise? i hope all of this makes sense my brain is a little jumbled up today",2

Could I be having benzo withdrawals after three weeks of use? In April I made the really dumb idea to use Phenibut almost daily for six weeks straight in mild/medium doses. I finally did a rapid taper of over one week and went through the hell of Phenibut withdrawal.

It is day 25 of me being post Phenibut and I feel miserable. I have been taking benzos for the past almost four weeks. When I went to the ER on the 26th of last month they put me on 2mg of Ativan. I started taking Klonopin this month and have steadily been going down on the dosage. I weaned down and took my last dose of 0.125mg last week.

A few days ago though I experienced such a wave of anxiety I thought I was about to have a seizure so I made the huge mistake of taking 0.250mg again. Fast forward to today. Today before yesterday I did not take anything and then yesterday I took 0.125mg again. Long story short I feel absolutely horrid. Today is probably the worst I have ever felt in my life. Before I was having mental issues but now I feel physically ill as well. And I remember too when I took the 0.250mg again, strangely, I had a very bizarre reaction. It calmed my anxiety but led to me having a horrid bout of depression.

I have also been taking Gabapentin through this and it doesn't seem to have helped. In fact, I feel like it has made things worse. Been taking that for three weeks at 900mg and I tapered down on that a few days ago. Went down 900mg, 800mg, 700mg, at 600mg today. Maybe that is why I feel awful? Then again though, the Gabapentin itself started making me feel terrible at times. It is a weird drug because somtimes it helps and other times it seems to make things worse.

Apologize for the long post but I feel absolutely horrible. Worst I have ever felt in my life and I am convinced this hell is never going to end. I would give up $30,000 if someone could just put me into a medically induced coma and get ALL of this filth out of my system. The Klonopin and Gabapentin...I want all of it out. I don't know what to do.

I apologize for spilling my guts but I just don't even know what to do. I don't even know what is going on. Is it the Phenibut Post-Acute causing this? The Klonopin? Gabapentin? If I just knew what was happening I would feel so much better.",2

Came in due to a week long blackout where I did an estimated 50mg of alprazolam (technically flualprazolam) and yeah, it was bad.  

Mentally I have a ton of intrusive thoughts, cravings, and anxiety.  Flashing lights, as well as **a lot** of visual snow and general visuals of 3D and 2D objects/pictures predominantly when I close my eyes.  Don't worry I'm not seeing people or anything, its just an annoyance really.

Physically I have muscle spasms, hand/limb/neck/jaw shakes/twitches, pulsating/cramping sensations, random eye movements, incremental and twitchy/shaky limb movements, general ""double"" movements like if I try to wave once I will sometimes do it twice randomly, as well as general physical discomfort around my chest/back/arms/legs.

All my symptoms seem to get worse as the day progresses and then reset in intensity when I sleep.  Note I take multiple medications broken up throughout the day to help with these symptoms so it shouldn't be that.

I was good for a solid three days off my taper then all of my physical symptoms showed up.  Was the taper too short?  I go in for a psych evaluation later today but I wanted to see some opinions from you guys too.

If it helps I'm on 20mg Latuda (anti-psychotic, bipolar disorder), 100mg Doxepin (anti-depressant, sleep and stress), 30mg Buspar (anxiolytic, cravings and anxiety), 0.5mg Clonidine (blood pressure regulator, anxiety/panic attacks), 100mg Vistaril (antihistamine, anxiety/panic attacks), and an unknown amount of Robaxin (muscle relaxer, muscle spasms, don't know the dose as its handled by the nursing team).

Anyone know whats up or have gone through something similar?  Thanks in advance!

Usage: 1.25mg of Ativan for a month down to 1mg of Ativan for 5 months (6 months total) 
Also was using 2.5-5mg of diazepam often in the afternoon during that time 

Before tapering: I was in tolerance and extremely sick on this medication. I had been damaged by an anti biotic first then an SSRI so it was the last drug in a list to treat the side effects of the others. I believe my GABA receptors had been badly damaged by the toxic reaction to anti biotic, which is why I reached tolerance so quickly. I was living in a depressed, anxious, zombie fog. I had crippling DR/DP. I could not be around people, noise or light. I was terrified of everything, life felt dark and sinister and I sometimes contemplated death to escape it. I felt completely disconnected from everyone and everything, like I was watching life from a dark basement. I had no energy and crippling head pressure. 

Taper using compounded Ativan capsules approx 11 weeks: 
0.95mg 3.5 weeks 
0.85mg 12 days 
0.75mg 17 days 
0.65mg 7 days 
0.5mg 7 days 
0.35mg 7 days  
0.2mg 5 days then JUMP! 

Symptoms:
First drop was by far the worst - insomnia, anxiety; could not relax my body, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, DRDP, achey muscles, depression 

Symptoms always levelled out after about 7 days. Never felt ‚Äúgood‚Äù symptoms just more tolerable 

Middle of taper started to get easier - infrequent insomnia- actually started sleeping better and dreaming again, prickly skin feeling, some anxiety, DPDR, short term memory issues/brain fog(since I was in tolerance), agoraphobia, muscle aches, nausea, tinnitus, fatigue  

Latter part or taper got easier again. Many people say it gets harder the lower they get down but not for me. It got easier and I was able to make slightly bigger and quicker drops- this is entirely individualised, I‚Äôm not advising anyone to go faster I just listened to my own body and knew I could. 
Main symptoms at the end being; DRDP, tinnitus very loud at night, occasional insomnia, aches, nausea and fatigue.   

Already a week into tapering I felt better. Refer to my earlier posts about things that came back right from the start. 
For me, I know this medication was damaging me and keeping me sick and I knew I would not begin to heal fully until I was off it. 

Since jumping - I hardly slept last night. Was to be expected. Part of it felt psychological. First time going to bed without taking something in 8 months or so. I only jumped yesterday, but I went out for a walk today and the DR was gone!!! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gone for good but I‚Äôve had it chronically for a year and non stop during my taper. I cried on my walk tears of joy. I ALREADY feel more myself inside. 

I don‚Äôt know how long it will take to feel better but I can‚Äôt express to you how good the feeling of waking up free of those chemical handcuffs is. If I can do it so can you!!! For a year straight I‚Äôve been convinced my life is over, unable to see any light at the end of the tunnel. I‚Äôve been to the depths of hell. I‚Äôm still not back yet but I‚Äôm here to tell you to KEEP GOING. Suffering is temporary. 

Every single day is a step closer to being healed.

I only know what I have researched, and this post is simply a personal testimony and a means to help someone who may be struggling with withdrawal or considering tapering off of their drug. I had been on Xanax for 5 years and was taking around 5mg daily at my highest dose. Everybody obviously metabolizes the drug differently and tolerance levels differ for different reasons, but for reference I was 15 when I started and took it until I was a (now) 20 year old 100 pound woman. Personally, I highly advise against quitting cold turkey from a hefty dose. I tried to quit cold turkey a little over a year ago and quickly understood why it was deemed so ""dangerous"". The tremors were crazy, I felt out of touch with reality/depersonalization, physically sick, hallucinations (seeing and hearing things), insomnia, bodily spasms, etc. I quickly dosed again so that I could be a functional human being. I know that the symptoms can be much more serious (psychosis, seizures etc.) Nonetheless, it felt like hell and I never thought I would never be able to get off of the drug. If you are on here looking to taper off, you probably know that the long term effects of benzo's are almost equally as daunting as the withdrawal symptoms. If you are on it long term, unfortunately you will have to keep increasing your dose in order to continuously benefit from the drug, all the while being trapped in a cycle of dependency and prolonged long term effects. It is an endless cycle, and the Big Pharma controversy is too complex to delve into, but it serves to know that the people PUTTING you on these drugs stay in business by KEEPING you on them. I understand that some people need medication and absolutely respect that. This post is mainly for those who want to get off of a benzo. Today I am off of the drug and want to shed light on what the process was like, as to help anyone who is looking online in TERROR like I once was, at the harsh reality of withdrawal.

I did a very slow taper, and I highly suggest it if you don't have the time or resources to enter a detox program. I somewhat imagine that the slow taper method is actually safer than a short term detox program, only because I have read that a more abrupt stop can permanently damage the brain. Full transparency: I do not know of what is entirely scientifically supported and what's not, I just know what worked for me and I promise I did much research. I did NOT water titrate my dose, but that has been effective for many people. I found that writing out (journaling) what I might experience during my next withdrawal helped me to be much more mentally stable during the first few days of a lesser dose. Doesn't have to be an essay-just a few symptoms you may experience (ex: dizzy, jumpy, sleepless, sick). Essentially you will be LESS subjected to rebound anxiety if you know what is to be expected. For me, it was truly all about being gentle with myself, and listening to my body. I cut my dose by 0.5mg each 3/4 month interval. Some people do shorter or longer intervals-I would suggest to just try what you are comfortable with. If I wasn't ready at an interval, I didn't taper yet. Patience is key, especially when you are working, in school, have a family, or frankly anything that you need to feel physically OKAY for. I believe that the tapering method can work for anyone at any dosage, as you are essentially ""weaning"" yourself off of your drug, all at your own pace. I only completed my taper about 5 days ago. The shift from 0.5mg to 0 was a bit frazzling at first but well worth the wait. There have been a few expected sleepless nights and some tremors but none of the capacity to hinder my ability to function. Symptoms will differ from person to person, and it helps to be researched on the possible withdrawal symptoms so you are aware of what may occur. The relief of not being dependent on a dangerous drug outweighs any of the final withdrawal symptoms. Moral of the story is that it 100% can be done safely and effectively. Try not to read yourself into fear (like I once did). Many people have done it, many are doing it, and you can too.",2

I was also put on antipsychotics - 1200mg of Seroquel (down to 12.5mg) and 8mg of Risperidone (down to 2mg), also for sleep. I take .12mg Clonidine for sleep/PTSD, which I'm not sure I'll stay on or not. Have to do some research on that one. Any thoughts on that drug (or any of them) are welcome. To help with sleep, I have gradually upped my melatonin to 120mg and I take 800mg of magnesium at night because I read it helps with sleep, too. I recently read that magnesium can help with benzo withdrawal ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/#\_ch24\_Benzodiazepines\_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/#_ch24_Benzodiazepines_))

&#x200B;

I started tapering off of Ativan by .5mg for two weeks at a time. Last night I went down by 1mg of Klonopin (is that too big of a drop?). For the past few weeks I've been having upper back pain, headaches, a weird feeling in my mouth like I need to brush my teeth, but it doesn't go away when I brush them, as well as a pain sensation in my teeth and jaw, and I've been really hot. Before posting, I read through some of The Ashton Manual and found these were all known side effects of withdrawal. I'm still able to work through all of it. (I have a pretty easy office job.)

&#x200B;

I also take 70mg of Vyvanse for ADHD and 300mg of Wellbutrin for depression. I'm almost off of 20mg of Adderall which my psychiatrist gave me to take in the afternoons because I was unfocused after lunch, but I realized I was actually just lazy. lol I started taking it in the mornings instead and I noticed I started making more mistakes at work, so I decided to just taper and get off of it. (I'm on .5mg this week, then off.)

&#x200B;

I was originally planning to reduce my Ativan to .25mg for two weeks, then stopping, and switching to 1mg pills of Klonopin then to .50mg and cutting those into quarters.

&#x200B;

What is the consensus on switching to Valium for an easier taper as it says in the Manual? At first, I was all set to do that, but as I read through the posts I saw some people with differing opinions on the Manual and tapering Valium.",5

I‚Äôve struggled with symptoms we thought could be related to my thyroid for over 10 years now. I spent the last 5 years on thyroid medication for sub clinical hypothyroidism and it didn‚Äôt help at all. The thyroid medication made me worse because it wasn‚Äôt my thyroid causing my symptoms. I was even told I had hashimotos autoimmune disease at one point and recently discovered that too was a misdiagnosis! The doctor I saw labeled me hashimotos without checking my antibodies (which are normal). I was finally advised to stop taking thyroid medication and many of my symptoms improved. But I am still left with intense symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, apathy, insomnia, digestive issues and so on. Which I can now clearly see is caused by benzo toxicity.

I am in the process of an Aston manual taper from 10 years on klonopin. Down to 12.5 mg Valium. Realizing that it was actually the benzos causing toxicity in my body rather than underlying health issues was truly liberating. My goal right now is to be off benzos and be healthy. I‚Äôve discovered through process of elimination that benzo toxicity is the root cause of 99% of my symptoms and poor health.

I just wanted to post a reminder why what we are doing is so important and that you all are amazing. Benzo toxicity and mimicking is no joke.",19

I have had to hold this taper due to having terrible WD during the days. 

A few days ago I decided to try and split up that dose taking 1/3 at around 11-12 AM and the remaining 2/3 at bedtime (10 pm-ish)

The first day or so that strategy seemed to work a bit. Tonight I awoke at 3AM and here I am. Wide awake and shaking. 

I can see where this is going. I was pretty much in the same situation sleep-wise this last fall/winter when sick and not knowing what was causing it. It took awhile to determine I was in WD from alprazolam. 

In Jan/Feb I was switched to clonazepam and as mentioned I began at .5mg and started dry cut tapering from there.

I have held firm on that .35mg clonazepam, not increasing it. 

But I fear I‚Äôve messed up by trying to split the dose and will have little choice but to up dose. The thought makes me shudder in agony.

Anyone else been here and have suggestions? I truly fear this is where it can spiral out of control badly. 

No sleep = up-dose; tolerance WD= up-dose; viscous cycle & never getting off.

I don‚Äôt have years to deal with this.

Amazing for sleep. Horrible for emotional regulation.

Read today that, because of it's sedating effect, that it MAY cause withdrawals similar to benzos, though no studies were cited.

Wondering if anyone has come off of valerian before and whether or not this is actually the case because Google is stupid and unreliable.

Was addicted to xanax I bought off the street for a long time (its robbed me of almost all memory of the 5 months I was abusing it), but then bc I had no money I was forced to cold turkey it, and although it was awfully brutal I managed to come around after a week and I was fine, even managed to stay 5 months sober.

But then I turned to diazepam as my anxiety and PTSD became so crippling that I couldnt leave the house and I was vomiting constantly, no sleep etc. Last week was the worst of my life. Was forced to cold turkey from a massive dose of diazepam and I ended up having 2 seizures within that week and my sleep and anxiety were so crippling I didn't even think it could get to that level. No doctor helped me with tapering or would prescribe me anything to help ease me off I was just left in a living hell and now I'm back to taking it, although this time its 10mg a day max and I've given the tablets to my dad to control that dose and he understands. 


Overall fuck diazepam, it's even more evil than xanax was imo and if I wasnt already at A&E that first seizure couldve likely been the death of me. I'm so sick of this cycle and I wouldnt wish this upon my worst enemy it's a living hell every day and my brain constantly plays on the shame I have embedded in me that I know I realistically shouldnt have. Sorry for such a long post it's just a really rough time recently. To all those on this subreddit, no matter what stage you're at, I'm extremely proud of yous for keeping on going and trying your best everyday bc this is torture, and to any of you in the UK I really hope you're getting the proper support you need bc the NHS isnt very forgiving when it comes to benzo addiction.

Will excessive sweating help me push these benZos out of my system quicker? With less withdrawal? After today I only plan on using benZos strictly for panic attacks and trip killer. I feel like I am able to control my usage, and will be putting the rest of my product in a lock box at a friends house and allowing her to give me dosages when I absolutely neeed them.

With such a short time of using I am hoping exercise over the next few days will push me back to baseline and have minimal withdrawals due to each expelling lot of anxiety/ energy through hard work.

Any thoughts? Should I go and push myself hard in the gym and sweat it out. Or will I still need to take a taper dose to wean myself even after only 4 days?

When I enter ""overheat mode"", eating seems to help. I generally eat white rice and an apple and it mitigates the feeling.

( used on and off for the last 3-4 years. Last two years have been using any benzo consistently. RC for six months, nitrazolam, diclazalam, clonazalam, flualprozolam, bromazalam,) and the the last six months have been using pressed bars ( not sure what with) reaching up to six to eight bars a day.

I did a rapid taper, and actually stopped for atleast a week. Then had 1 bar in the AM. Later that night had a seizure in a inpatient. Followed by another the next day. 

In the ER I was prescribed alprozolam with I started with about 2mg a day untill I dropped to 1.5 then 0.5 for about two days. The drop was to much and I switched to Ativan 3 mg for two days then 2 mgs for two days. 1 mg two days, then now was supposed to do 0.5 for two but the drop was two big and I stuck with 1 mg. Now am out of meds but am prescribed Librium, for two days then followed by diazepam 5 mg pills. 

I will be trying to take 1, 5 mg diazepam a day if I can handle it. But one of the hardest things I‚Äôve noticed is extreme fatigue and feeling of general uneasiness

No matter what I do waking up, folding clothes, dishes, basic chores around the house. I feel extremely winded and at times like I‚Äôm going to pass out.

This has prevented me from doing things I want to do and need to do. Around the 22-23 I am to start working again and really nervous because much of what I do is hard physical labor.

TLDR; Does anyone have advice for benzo fatigue? I am a lot of meds at the moment. Slowly trying to cut a lot of them out to see if that helps now that I‚Äôm starting to sleep normal again. But this is fucked up any advice greatly appreciated.",1

Just looking for support right now because I've really been struggling with withdrawal. I was only on it for ~2 months, but it became essential to me for going to bed and getting out of bed. I'm on other medications for bipolar disorder, but my med provider gave me Buspar to try and mitigate some of the withdrawal symptoms. It takes the edge off, but I'm still struggling massively with the fear, dread, anxiety, whatever you want to call it. I've lost almost 15 pounds from not eating as much as I should, have had GI issues for weeks (even when I was on it). Really struggling with focusing or really wanting to do anything. I smoke marijuana in small amounts to help me eat/ease anxiety, but the days really drag on with this kind of anxiety. The last 3 weeks have felt like 3 months. Lack of focus is causing problems at work. I'm taking loads of vitamins I've seen suggested around, and stuff like l-theanine, anything that can maybe help me. The stress is multilayered because I'm in a really difficult financial spot as well (just don't make enough, in a lot of medical/school debt that I can't afford minimum payments for. Also had to get a new car recently. My dad helps me out sometimes just to keep my head above water because I don't qualify for any kind of assistance). I've been feeling VERY alone lately, even though I know I'm not. I hear a lot about withdrawals lasting a long time, and I just don't know if I can deal with this anxiety without something snapping. I feel like I'm one piece of bad news away from a total breakdown.",9

In February I got prescribed 1 mg of ativan twice a day for my anxiety and OCD. I went through withdrawal about 10 years ago and I knew it can get very bad, so I didn't even take that full dose, I usually just took it before bed so I could sleep and toughed it out during the day. Anyway, I started tapering from even that pretty quickly, maybe a month later, and now I'm at  about 0.25mg for about a week.

 I was at about 0.5 mg a week before today and I was feeling okayish, but now I have severe depression episodes and medium anxiety throughout the day. I was wondering could this be because of the withdrawal or is my underlying condition poking through again? (My ocd was causing me to be depressed). I thought I managed to get my anxiety and ocd under control, I'm doing everything right, I exercise 4 times a week, I eat well, I meditate, do breathing exercises, try to socialize as much as possible and work as much as I can.  


This just seemed to me like a very low dose to be producing such withdrawal symptoms. When I went through it 10 years ago I was on much higher dosages and had comparable symptoms.   
And yeah, I know I should go to the doctor but I have no insurance and would rather not have to pay if possible.",1

2021-06-18 00:18:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/o2gf9b/helpful_advice_about_tapering/,Helpful advice about tapering,"&#x200B;

I am nearly at the end of the tapering part of my recovery, and I am planning to jump on Tuesday. I have found this sub to be so important in supporting me in my tapering ‚Äújourney‚Äù, I have learnt so much and met so many lovely and helpful people & just thought I would create a post sharing what I have learnt so far and what has worked for me (like SO many other kind people on here have done before me). Their posts, advice and reassurance were truly so significant. I hope to post a ‚Äúpart 2‚Äù when I jump and then another one when I finally fully recover!   
 

My taper has been 3 months in total, off 1mg of Ativan used for 5-6 months (1.25mg used for a month of this).  I was in massive tolerance and very sick when I finally realised that I needed to taper off.   
 

**TL/DR: My opinion or personal advice about tapering and what worked for me! I have linked anything important. Feel free to ask any questions.**   
 

**1. Read the** [**Ashton Manual**](https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/)**.** Written by Heather Ashton, a British psychopharmacologist and physician. She is best known for her clinical and research work on benzodiazepine dependence and worked with countless people in withdrawal. The guide is a great place to start as it gives a clear and concise explanation behind the mechanisms of benzos on the brain and CNS, as well as explanations for tolerance and a guide to tapering off. You do not have to follow these guides to the letter, but it gives a good starting point and the idea of ‚Äúcut a small amount and hold‚Äù will help you get in the correct mindset for your taper

**2. Set up your taper with appropriate professional support.**   
 For me, this included:  
  \- a GP who I printed the Ashton Manual for, and advised about my taper. You will need a GP or Psychiatrist to provide the script for the benzo if you don‚Äôt have enough left to taper off fully. IMO, this is ALL you need a GP for at this point. Unless you meet a doctor, who is truly benzo wise (I never did). 

\-Work out what method of tapering will work best for you. I found a really helpful compounding pharmacy, a pharmacy that can create different amounts of medication tailored to what you need. (This is in Australia so not fully sure about the options you may have overseas). My GP had to send a brief letter explaining my situation and then the compound pharmacist made up capsules for me each time I emailed him. This REALLY took the stress out of the process for me, but most people successfully taper off using scales or water titration. 

\-In Australia, I had access to something called [‚ÄòReconnexion‚Äô](http://www.reconnexion.org.au/) a government run program that offers treatment, support and information about benzodiazepine dependency and withdrawal, anxiety, insomnia and depression. Even if you aren‚Äôt in Australia, you can look through their website as they have a lot of really helpful resources. My counsellor Phoebe, helped develop a tapering plan with me (they use the Ashton Manual) and I was entitled to free weekly or fortnightly counselling sessions as well. During these sessions we would discuss the taper in general, the speed of the taper, how I felt, symptoms, challenges etc   
 Reconnexion also liaises with your GP and send them the tapering plan.   
 

I felt I really had a good little team working behind me to ensure my taper ran as smoothly as possible.   
 

**3. Personal support:**  
 Obviously, this is not possible for everyone, but if you have a close family member and/or friend you can lean on for support it makes a world of difference. It‚Äôs also important they understand what you‚Äôre going through, and I found this [‚Äúdear family and friends‚Äù letter](https://benzowithdrawalhelp.com/recovery/dear-friends-and-family-this-is-benzo-withdrawal/) really helpful to explain the crux of benzo wd. I also just used to send my Mum or best friend any good threads or articles I found on the matter to help further facilitate their understanding about what I was going through.   
 

**4. Have a routine**  
 I don‚Äôt mean like run a marathon or work a 12-hour day. I found just making myself have a shower and get dressed daily as a starting point was really important. It sounds small, but I found just cleaning myself and getting dressed for the day helped to a) separate ‚Äúday‚Äù from ‚Äúnight‚Äù which is really important when you are stuck at home a lot and potentially having issues sleeping, and b) it actually helps pass the day faster when you start partaking in a short daily checklist of things to do. I also found I just physically felt better when I was clean and dressed. I also added other things into my routine such as:   
 \-meditation (10 mins) using headspace app  
 \-yoga stretches 10 mins using [yoga with bird on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAlqCq-7GN8)  
 \-walk (even if 5 mins!) sunlight before 10:30am is really good for setting up your circadian rhythm properly i.e., helping you sleep! Exercise also good for creating new neural pathways and sleep  
 \-water plants once or twice a week   
 \-writing in gratitude journal every night   
 \-clean something small ‚Äì I usually try to unstack dishwasher or restack   
 \-Netflix  
 \-Podcasts  
 \-Puzzles   
 \-Gardening  
 

Some days are going to be a lot harder than others, I found ‚Äúshowering and getting dressed‚Äù to be the baseline for my routine. If all I did was shower and get dressed in a day then that was good enough. If I managed to do some or all of the other things on the list that was a bonus.   
 

**5. Get off forums/Facebook groups**  
 I know this seems counterproductive to say on here, but trawling forums and groups too hard really affected me negatively. There was a helpful FB group admin that came up with a taper plan for me, free of charge that I didn‚Äôt end up using, but other than that, I found the FB groups to be the most depressing and horrifying platform on which to first discover benzo wd and the tapering process.   
 I had so much anticipatory anxiety and hopelessness, I felt suicidal at the beginning of my taper and after my first drop. I would say 70% of this was down to the long-term PAWS commentors on the groups who told me my taper would take 12 months + and I‚Äôd likely be damaged for years if not forever. I am not taking away from people who have these horrific experiences, but I even had an admin of one of the groups message me privately to say that they only people commenting and replying to me were long term users that had a whole host of other issues and/or addictions/prescriptions that they weren‚Äôt forthcoming about.   
 

I felt immediately less anxious when I left these groups.  
 

This sub is wonderful and there are so many knowledgeable and supportive people on here, but I would get into bad habits of trawling the group endlessly at night-time and reading horror stories which only proved to increase my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a bad call to have some time away from the sub and keep yourself distracted.   
 

**Ways to keep distracted:**   
 I mentioned some above but I tended to do:  
 yoga, puzzles, walks, cooking, cleaning, meditation, workouts   
 NETFLIX ‚Äì I binged watch series‚Äô and made a checklist of the ones I liked (feel free to message me for the list!)   
 I also wrote a blog about my experience. I am hoping I‚Äôll be able to share it in a few weeks and it‚Äôll provide more detailed insight. Focusing on the blog helped give my days more purpose as well.   
 \-Things like exercise and meditation are super effective and important for healing during WD  
 

**Supps/food/sleep:**  
 \-I tended to eat really healthily, avoiding gluten, dairy and sugar where I could. Eat protein, fruit and veg wherever possible. Organic is best. **HOWEVER**, I can‚Äôt stress this enough, be kind to yourself. I tended to binge out on yummy junk food on the weekend and yes, while this can create excess glutamate and heighten your WD symptoms, I didn‚Äôt care. I already felt lousy most of the time and treating myself on the weekend with delicious food was good for the soul, something also equally as important  
 \-Drink LOADS of water  
 \-Supps are individual to everyone and what works for one may not work for another, I take l-theanine, magnesium glycinate, NAC and melatonin. I found these worked for me but I had to experiment to find out. B vitamins and Mag threonate really revved up my symptoms. It may be trial and error  
 **-Sleep hygiene:**   
 \-try avoid phone lights 30-60 mins before bed  
 \-I take 300mcg of melatonin 20 mins before sleeping ‚Äì found it more helpful than higher doses --which made me groggy in the morning  
 \-I also use an eye mask and ear plugs and I KNOW they sound futile but they were both massive gamechangers for me, allowing me to get into a little cocoon to sleep  
 \-Read fiction for 20-40 mins before sleeping   
 \-If I couldn‚Äôt sleep at the start of my taper I would get into this riled up anxious state of hysterical crying. I tried to get better at how I dealt with this though, in the latter half of my taper when I can‚Äôt sleep, I try to have a level of acceptance about it. I tell myself ‚ÄúOkay so you may not sleep and that‚Äôs gonna be okay, you‚Äôre not gonna die, you‚Äôve dealt with this before, you have nothing on tomorrow‚Äô. It sounds a bit lame but I actually found that and focusing on breathing really deeply to be super helpful and eventually I would fall asleep most times.   
 

 **Things to remember:**  
 \-Your story is YOURS and no-one else‚Äôs, you can read 100 different stories on a group or forum but they‚Äôre never going to be exactly the same as your experience   
 

\-Your BODY is YOURS and no-one else‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt ever let someone tell you what is right for you, arm yourself with the knowledge and be your own judge. I had a couple of people be really negative about my decision to speed up my taper, or make bigger drops. I am SO glad I listened to my own body and followed my own intuition. No one else can tell you what you are prepared for or what you can handle (within reason). Go with your gut.   
 

\-Make things as conducive to healing as humanly possible. I had super comfy PJ‚Äôs, a clean environment, candles, diffusers, plants etc   
 

\-The body is an incredibly smart machine; it is always looking to return to homeostasis. Time is the biggest healer of all.   
   
 

\*I forgot to mention that a lot of people change across to diazepam to do their taper, given its longer half-life making it suitable for tapering. I chose not to change across and tapered straight down from Ativan. This is again a personal choice.

I really just want to share my success story with anyone who is really down bad. Middle aged person who has always had terrible social anxiety. I started abusing drugs around 15. I used every prescription but never really got hooked until 22-23. 17-22 I was pretty addicted to Vicodin but never to the point of committing crimes to obtain. My friends mom sold me her prescription every month. Sad I know. 120 10mg hydrocodones for years. Found kratom switched for cost. I don't really wanna get much into opiates as I see them as (possible) to get off but they do mess up your reward system pathways and the urge to use lingers for months if not years.

Now into the hell of benzos. I was introduced to them in high school. Almost everyone had prescriptions even drug addicts. Bars were cheap 3-5$ and filled directly at pharmacy. Never abused constantly till college. Obtained lots of etizolam and this started my addiction. I was using daily. I did taper but my anxiety became uncontrollable. I tried every rc benzo. The one that ruined me was clonazolam and flualprazolam. I abused them for months and after I was fried for 3 years. I had 5 seizures. 2 while driving 1 while swimming and was pulled from drowning. I crashed 3 vehicles and one of which I was given a DUI for a seizure !!! Still dealing with that as they found metabolites in my blood. Tens of thousands spent on medical bills. I got nerve damage in my face which causes partial paralysis. It is slowly getting better. I was experiencing a very protracted DT withdrawal. I had bouts of mania that were absolutely terrifying. Impending doom is all I can say. I was hearing voices and music constantly. I was very very suicidal. It was unbearable. My life was falling apart and I was almost written off as brain damaged which is far from me as I work in scientific field ( regenerative medicine). 

Covid hits and I'm so depressed I sleep all day. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and he prescribed me tons of antipsychotics. My brain falls apart. I can't think normal. Feel normal. I get so nervous I shake like a leaf. I finally tell doc I want off antipsychotics but will stay on Prozac. Lockdown is over and I feel amazing. NO drugs at all besides medical marijuana and prosac. I'm shocked. I went from spending every other month in the psychiatric unit to having so much energy I can't find enough things to do. 

Please do not give up. Benzos almost killed me. I did not tell my doc this but I'm sure he deduced it from my medical history. His approach was bipolar anxiety depression and believe me the DT can make you look like your crazy!! I was abusing upwards of 10mg clonazolam a day!!!! My anxiety is still bad in high-stress ( public speaking ) but everyday life anxiety is almost GONE!!!! the goal is to never surrender never give up!! It took me 3 years!!!",56

My plan is to just wait as much time as I can every run and then take the dose when stronger wd symptoms start kicking in. When I'm able to do 5-7 days I'm just going to suck it up and wait it out.   


Do you think it is a bad idea? My dosages weren't high (at most 15mg, usually 5mg) and I'm taking 2.5mg now when I need it. I see people tapering down to 1mg (daily) and just cut it off. Considering the half life of diazepam I think this tactic could work. I do want to avoid exitotoxicity and PAWS. Last time I did a really quick taper, jumped off and it took me at least 3 months to start feeling better. This time I want to be careful and will probably jump off 1mg to minimize the damage.

So I have been self medicating (I know it‚Äôs stupid) with xanax with normally 2mg in the morning and sometimes another before bed that‚Äôs literally the max I take but I have taken it most days for maybe the past couple months and yesterday I didn‚Äôt take one in the morning and headed to the beach. 

I swallowed too much ocean water and started dry drowning a bit making it hard to breathe and my whole body started to go kinda numb and tingly. 

Then as I looked up symptoms of dry drowning I started getting super anxious for some reason that I may have some bad case of dry drowning cause I was feeling super sick and light headed. 

Then on the way to the pharmacy to see if they had any otc pills for dry drowning and to grab a bite to eat to see if that would help it just kept getting worse and worse to the point where i could not talk at all without gasping for air like i was drowning and I couldn‚Äôt move my body at all like even my fingers were stuck out straight like I could not even move them to try and grip my phone or water bottle or anything and I felt like I was going to faint and then I started like spazzing out major with the breathing my misso had to pull over in a parking lot and as she stopped I tried to open my door for fresh air and nearly fell out of the car to the ground still in my seatbelt which made a bunch civilians start freaking out and the ambo got called. 

So a doctor in the crowd calmed me down before the ambo got there and then the paramedics just checked on me and said I had just had a panic attack (I told them I didn‚Äôt take any medication I know i‚Äôm stupid) and they let me go, I have had severe anxiety all my life but never have had a panic attack, but even a couple days before this I took no xanax and was fine then so I guess my question is do you guys think this has anything to do with my self medication with benzos?

I was honestly scared more then I have ever been before while having that panic attack so I feel for anyone who goes through them regularly.

When I got back to the hotel I just had 1mg of xanax and then another 1mg of xanax before bed and have felt fine since I plan to do the same for the next week or two and then have a break or stop for good. 

Has anyone else ever had something like this happen to them? I would appreciate any support or advice.

I think I'm pretty addicted. 

I play what I call the 'Game of fives':
5x Xanax 2mg, 5x Valium 5mg, 5x Nitrazepam 5mg (not flunitraz), 5x Clonazepam 2mg, 5x Triazolam 0.125mg.

(Since Xanax is locked in the safe now I've been swapping other benzos to my dealer for Xanax. )

It's taken me months to get to this dose of benzos and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna fucking die if I come off it cold turkey or if they find out what I'm doing and fire me.

My question is, how do I go about quitting, do I just take the equivalent dose in like just Valium for example then step down from there?

Any help is appreciated.",4

Prior to that I was taking a very small dose of xanax or ativan twice a week for the last few months. So the habit just recently ramped up. My Doctor switched me to 5mg of Valium three times daily to start tapering me off. I do believe he underestimated the calculation but, regardless some days I have taken up to 30mg of Valium and it just doesn't seem to get rid of all the withdrawals, I was under the impression if you took equal amount of Valium to xanax that it would be a seamless transition. This is not the case for me.  Its almost as though my body is craving the xanax and whatever amount of valium I take doesnt satisfy it. Admittedly I have not tried taking 50/60+mg of Valium at a time so I can't say for a fact that if I took even more  it would do the trick but, it just doesnt seem like the transition is working and Im frustrated.  Am I not giving it enough time? Am I doing something incorrectly? Any advice, or help is appreciated....",2

This is so fuckin difficult. I also have like 5 or 6 5mg valiums as well and thinking about taking one just to sleep man I've tried EVERYTHING!!!! 

I've tried various supplements and shit and nothing seems to work. I sleep for like an hour here and there. Probably not more than 2 or 3 hours at MOST this past week and that's broken up sleep. This has been going on for SO long now and it is affecting my life so negatively. I can't hold conversations and I'm just flat-lined all day. I can't move my body and my job is very physical.  I don't know what the fuck to do.

I have access to gabapentin and phenibut and I've got some kava and reishi mushrooms that kind of make me tired but then I'm up an hour later. I also have seroquel that I'm wary to take though. I feel fuckin irritated at everything and anxious and almost high like I'm so out of it. I know those are side effects of benzo recovery anyway but I feel like this extreme lack of sleep for so long is REALLY making it SO much worse. I've had sleeping problems for years now but this is getting to the point where I can't live my life. 

Is there anything you guys do to actually STAY asleep? Even just 4 or 5 hours STRAIGHT without waking up would probably do me wonders and improve my mood so much. I feel so hopeless. I have serious anhedonia that I think may improve if only I can sleep for a while. After today, I have a week off from work and I'm really going to try and not take much benzo during this time.

Oh yeah I also on suboxone and take gabapentin kinda regularly too, but I feel like I need to just stop one thing at a time. I go to horizons and can get pretty much anything that is not a controlled substance prescribed to me. I have gotten some seroquel, some propranolol and clonidine. I haven't really taken those things too much tho, but I think I'm gonna give em a shot again..",2

I had covid and been recovering ever since. The last few weeks when i start feeling better in hospital(state hospital in South africa)i was very afraid of the people there and got double pneumonia after covid so i start using Clonazepam 0.5mg everyday i did then skip a day or 2 in between. Prob 6-7 days in a row

Got discharged and had still little infection and had to take antibiotics and they make me extremely nervous so i continued taking Clonazepam 0.5mg for 7 days in a row, 8 if you take last night. Also, the reason i have been taking 0.5mg every day since being discharged is cause of fear of withdrawals.

Yesterday i thought to myself may check what withdrawals are like and maybe ask here how to get off Clonazepam now and i read horrific horror report that gave me one of the most intense panic attacks i ever had. 

It shook me so i am still afraid of getting a panic attach just typing this. TBH I AM F SCARED I GOT MYSELF IN HELL.

What should i do? Please help

I am not sure i am even addicted to it yet other than the panic attack i got but i am a very nervous person so could just got a fright of my life.

Is it hard getting off Clonazepam 0.5mg if you used it for like 14 days in a row? How should i taper if i have to?

p.s. Please no horror stories don't want to get another panic attack.

They **are primary or secondary targets of many of the available anticonvulsants** \[[199](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R199)\]. These include drugs enhancing GABAA receptor action through a direct interaction with the receptor (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, stiripentol, topiramate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, felbamate) or indirectly by increasing the available GABA (tiagabine, vigabatrine, gabapentin, valproate) \[[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R51), [90](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R90), [156](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R156), [199](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R199), [251](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645547/#R251)\].

PS. I'm not trying to say that you should stay away from anticonvulsants at any cost as some of them can still be helpful in certain cases (*especially* when used against seizures), but you need to be aware.

PPS. Recently I had terrible rebound from short use of carbamazepine and was absolutely astounded by it. It felt like a benzo relapse. Furthermore, I discovered that it had a great effect on my mood (in a negative way) which as it turns out can be perfectly explained by, again, it's action on gaba as analyzed in the article above.",3

I'm coming up on a year here in 27 days. Things continue to get better and better, though there's not much change from here and month 10 off. My cognitive abilities continue to improve.  I will say in hindsight I was definitely dealing with PAWS pretty heavily despite my claims of otherwise. When you're on Klonopin as long as I was you forget things when it comes to who you really are. I'm definitely thinking off nuking this account once my year comes up and leaving this part of my life behind me. 

I always like to remind everyone I did cold turkey off Klonopin that I was on for close to the last 7-8 years with many other years of on/off before this latest and last stretch. 

So overall a boring post but a reminder to everyone that we all will heal eventually.",2

My psychiatrist on the other hand told me at the beginning that if I feel like it's not the right one for me I can try something else. But the thing is after everything I've read I do not want to take benzos at all. He also suggested antidepressants which I'm not that scared of because I've been on one before and I was able to come off fairly easily.

&#x200B;

In the last month I've taken a benzo everyday and in total consumed \~150 mg etiz, 18 xanax bars, 5 mgs of flualprazolam, few mgs of clonazolam, and few mgs of flubromazolam. I strained a muscle in my back while working out and was having these crazy muscle spasms so I started taking benzos to relieve the spasms. It worked well for that purpose. Now that my back is somewhat better I am trying to quit cold turkey. However I am finding this much harder than anticipated.

&#x200B;

After a certain amount of time has passed without taking a benzo I feel anxious and my muscles start twitching, which is to be expected. But then I'm also getting general depersonalization/derealization feelings. And then it gets to a point where I feel this surreal sense of vertigo rush over me. It literally feels like my body is riding a wave and spinning at the same time. It scares the shit out of me. Whenever this happens I cave and take a small dose of a benzo. This has happened a few times now over these last few days. I've read that vertigo can be a warning sign for a grand mal seizure. In addition to the benzos I mentioned earlier I also have diclazepam, meclonazepam, flubromazepam, and bromazolam coming in the mail. I was super barred out and unfortunately made a huge purchase of rc benzos online. Should I taper off instead of cold turkey and if so, which is best for tapering?

&#x200B;

Literally just had the weird vertigo experience again and took a .3 sublingual dose of flual. I'm still shaking. Also have l-theanine, ashwagandha, cbd + cbg, valerian root, blue vervain, chamomile supplements that help somewhat with anxiety. I'm really just not trying to have a seizure here. I've read cbd is good for that but in addition to my other questions, any advice and/or supplements to avoid a seizure?",4

This has been going on for a month or so..

The healthcare in my country sucks, They will just label me as a criminal/addict and I could risk my job and driving‚Äôs license. So mentioning that to my doctor is out.

Was I about to have a seizure or was I over reacting? 

If you read my previous posts basically I was taking 1mg of Etizolam which has a half life similar to Alprazolam for about 1-2 years only TWICE a week and never changed my dose or increased my frequency.

I made a few posts on here about it and how scared I am of having a seizure and so I decided to do a taper of sorts and cut my usage down to 0.5mg twice a week of Etizolam since I have enough to do a taper. 

But everyday I just keep worrying and stressing about if I‚Äôm going to have a seizure and die or no one will be around. Everything is scaring me about having a seizure.

I recently had to break off my relationship i had with someone. Im not gonna go into detail but texting her the break up text gave me so much stress and anxiety. It took me 3 days to type it up. It was effecting my sleep, my mood, my work. I mainly use medicinal cannabis to help with this anxiety but in this time of covid i was smoking so much it really wasnt helping anymore, tolerance got high. 

Well i was offered some klonopin to help with this. I took it because at that point i couldnt handle the physical parts of stress/anxiety. My stomach was twisting, my heart was breaking out of my chest, i could see my heartbeat in my eyes cuz my blood pressure spiked. But heres the thing, i study drug education and harm reduction, i knew all about the side effects of benzos and withdrawal. I only took them knowing that people take them for panic attacks because i didnt wanna have one. 

Well ive been taking the klonopin for 4 days. I was taking .5mg after i would get off work, and  .5 b4 i went to bed. Problem is i forgot how clonazepam was a long lasting benzo rather than a short acting. I stopped feeling the effects on the 8th ish. I started taking it on the 4th. I havent taken it in like 3 days and these withdrawls are horrible.. 

It started fine,  but its gotten kinda bad. Ive had slight hallucinations over the past 2 days. I havent had tremors but my muscles hurt so much and they twitch sometimes, mood changes, and confusion. It was only 4 days of use. I went thru 3.5mg. 

The thing im scared of is seizures...i dont know if i have enough to taper for a whole month or year or however long this lasts... 

Sometimes these symptoms fade a bit when anxiety is low but when it spikes the withdrawal symptoms spike... am i gonna be like this for a long time ? I didnt mean for it to be like this i just needed to control the anxiety somehow... i have friends who have turned their brains into mashed potatoes because of benzos so i steered clear of clear of them up til this point.

I had bought a computer while on the klonopin. Which yea i did need.. but it was 2200$..and i dont even have a monitor to use it. So i dont have the money to go to the hospital if i have a seizure.. i have a finite amount of klonopin left to start a taper with If i have to. I feel like 4 days of use isnt enough for a chemical dependency but..thats what i came here to ask.. is 4 days addiction territory ?that and, i need some help on how to deal with all this. Its easier doing research on benzos Than actually experiencing them.. ill never touch these things again..",1

Oura ring.
 Expensive but it's very accurate with sleep and HRV tracking. Helps with how your body is doing with a taper. Stinks for workout tracking but use Google fit for that. Oura links to it.

Mindfulness meditation.

Don't go into thinking, ""I'm hitting nirvana and anxiety be gone!""  I still sometimes think, this can't be working. 4 months into it, if you just do it twice a day for 15 mins even if you feel your ""not doing it right"" or don't feel like doing it, just keep doing it. I recommend Jon Kabat-Zinn's book Full Catastrophe Living
This along with his CDs. It's helped during bad withdrawal situations.

Talk therapy
 
something made you take the pills in the first place. Time to find out what it was. You won't believe it, but after 3-4 months of once a week sessions it does start to make sense. Doesn't have to be a psychiatrist. Just find someone familiar with CBT. 

Apps
Medito is okay in a pinch.
Breathly is good for panic attacks or then coming on

Some libraries have library cards that let you check out audiobooks. Take advantage of this. Even if you have to drive to a big city and pay $10 a year it's worth it.",7

At my peak, I was taking 25-30mg of etizolam + 4mg clonazolam daily. Three years ago my dosage stabilized at 4mg clonazepam + 3mg flubromazolam daily and this is the dosage that I tapered off of. I tapered over the course of a year or so although I went too quickly at the end and had a grand mal seizure five days after going to zero. My withdrawal symptoms are still pretty heavy and it's likely I've been significantly kindled by all the times I recklessly seesawed my dosage when I was in my early twenties.

What's worrying me now is my weight and nutrition, I am rarely hungry and when I am I can barely get food down. Everything either has such a strong taste to it that it overwhelms me or tastes like dry cardboard. I have some sensory issues due to OCD and I've found them massively amplified by the withdrawals. I've lost 15 pounds over the last 5 months and I don't have that weight to lose as I am now sitting around 140lbs at 6'2. In order to try to gain some back, I've started drinking weight-gaining shakes which are almost flavorless and palatable, and I've been smoking weed to try to get small meals in when I can.

Is this experience familiar to anyone else? Does anyone have any ideas for things I could do in order to lessen this? I hope everyone is keeping their heads up, I never imagined that I'd be benzo free after how incredibly stupid I was with my consumption but I'm glad to be back in the world.",3

I've was taking 1mg of Ativan for 8 weeks for sleep. I perhaps a little too quickly tapered to 0.5  4 days ago and immediately my night sleep was cut to half, I now wake up usually after 4 hours and unable to fall asleep. I'm exhausted and it's affecting my mood. Also get quite anxious all day long, which I also understnd is part of this. I even used a tiny bit of Hydroxizine last night, which was bearly helpful 

My question is: if I stay on this dose, will it level off, then I can taper a bit more? I've had and read so much contradicting advice I'm not sure what to do. I suspect I should bear with it a few days longer and sleep might get better?

I started at 0.75mg daily for a few weeks, eventually it went up to 2mg daily. About a week ago my doctor had me cross-taper to Klonopin 1mg per day. The cross-taper only lasted about 6 days, which I personally think was too fast, but my doctor wanted me off the Xanax and refused to give me any more.

As of now I‚Äôve been off the Xanax for 4 days and now on Klonopin 1mg, split up 4 times/day. I have good days and bad days, but overall doing ok. Even though I was on the Xanax for a short time, my body got highly addicted to it. At this point I am just glad to be done with the Xanax. 

My issue now is tapering off the Klonopin. I‚Äôve only been on the Klonopin for a week. I was thinking of trying to taper by going down 0.25mg once a week. I know this is considered a fast taper, but I feel like since I haven‚Äôt been on it that long that maybe it‚Äôs doable. What do you think? Any advise would be appreciated.

I searched and haven't found any posts about this. I've been tapering down from 110 mg diazepam to 15 mg diazepam daily after six months. It's mostly gone smoothly and I feel so much better now than I ever did.

I have an amazing doctor.. He is extraordinary and completely helpful and understanding. He told me to stop the taper now and plateau at 15 mg for a bit and then start again when I feel ready. I'm now at a legal therapeutic dose so he wants me to focus on recovering my life and being stable more than anything.

Two weeks into the plateau, I have random panic attacks that I never had before. Some have emotional triggers but others are just out of the blue. They're accompanied by dramatically increased tremor rate per minute with extended hand and they are overwhelming for about an hour.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience while holding a plateau in a taper once you're at a safe enough dose to live? I will cut to zero but I do need to live and I'm clearheaded and can live now, so I think I may plateau for a month.

I'd love to hear from others who have had this experience. It's really very disconcerting. It's totally random and makes no sense but it sounds exactly like post-acute withdrawal, just at a plateau.

I haven't posted here yet but I've been following for quite a while, Thanks so much to everyone in this sub; it is a model for a supportive community.",5

Soooo, my partner and I are both addicted and dependent on Etizolam and Kratom. We have tried and abused pretty much every RC benzo in the past in the ""honeymoon days"" as well as experimented with Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, and Ativan, and we used to abuse Percocet, till I found Kratom. I lost my source for Perc and it was too expensive online, so I fell in love with Kratom. Back when I started, all the vendors were saying it was only as addictive as coffee. I ignorantly did not know what I was getting myself into. I have tapered off completely before, but probably the longest break was 6-7 days (without benzos). In October '19, I wanted to get off Kratom, used Clonazolam, abused it and didn't stop after I was through the woods of Kratom WD. I had jumped at 8GPD from a 30GPD habit.

Fast forward to now, I am a shell of my former self. I stay up late, I sleep in as long as I can. I'm afraid of everything, can barely leave my house without Kratom + Etizolam dose. I'm malnourished. I don't drink much water. I'm living like an invalid junkie. I was going to full-time school for a specific job, but I had to withdrawal (I can go back when I'm ready--I paid upfront) because it was like 24 credit hours. Also classes were all gonna be in-person, starting at 8:45am, and I've never been a morning person. With my bad memory, anxiety, having to manage addictions secretly while in 8-hr days of class, and not being able to work because the material IS DIFFICULT. Lots of science and learning it way too fast. I was having panic attacks, so I withdrew. I felt better for the first few days...so much stress off my shoulder.

But now I find myself at home, wasting away, maybe able to accomplish 4 tasks per day. Somedays I do nothing but shower and jerk off and eat a little and hit my vape compulsively. I'm so demotivated. I feel worthless and hopeless.

OKAY: so here's my dilemma. Everything I've read about using Suboxone to quit Kratom is that it's outrageous, especially for 20GPD. I might understand if I was using 60GPD+... I've asked several friends who know the drug world and they all say it's a bad idea. Along with almost everyone on Reddit from other posts I've seen. And I mostly agree. The doctor wrote me one week of Clonazepam, 1mg, 2x daily. He was gonna give me Xanax but I said I hate intradose withdrawals. And of course he referred me to the MAT program two floors below him. I think they hate Kratom because the docs, FDA, and Big Pharma are losing patients to a natural plant. My partner goes to same doctor and he started Suboxone about 3 weeks ago. He started at 8mg, and now is prescribed 16mg on the weekend and 8-10 during the work week. He quit Kratom like after 2 days and has no cravings (DUH). But what astounded me the most is he was able to lower his Etizolam use from 20mg to 4mg immediately. He started having some tremors at night, and I recognized he was going through benzo WDs from the rapid dosage cut, but the doctors didn't agree. He took a little more Etizolam for a few days and he seems better. But I also think the Suboxone is just a band-aid for the benzo problem.

SO this is a long-ass post. I'm sorry. My question is...should I try Suboxone? It has changed him for the better. He doesn't need to dose benzos every 4 hours and he isn't having to time out Kratom and food, or worrying about which strain to take, etc. I'm jealous of that. He smiles now and laughs. He has more energy. He is like a brand-new person. Meanwhile I'm still taking 20G of Kratom a day and at least 18-20mg of Etizolam. Day 2 of Klonopin so I know I will likely be able to lower Etiz as well. My partner had a good argument. He said ""everything you've been doing since you started taking Percocet hasn't worked. things just have gotten worse. Maybe it's time to listen to medical professionals.""

I am SOOOO divided on this. I have an appt next week and have already expressed concerns about moving from Kratom to an actual, super-potent opioid, usually indicated for those with opioid use disorder. But maybe I'm in denial. If someone offered me a pain pill, I would take it in a heartbeat. I also made the mistake of ordering 200 Nucynta from India one night when I was really high on Etizolam and Flubromazolam. Haven't had any of that since January or February. I remember being dope sick in class and it was pretty bad for a few days. It's been over a month since I ordered and not sure it's even shipped... maybe it won't come. I'll be mad, especially because it contained a bunch of Cialis and Viagra (which I DO need). But shit, what if it does come and I have 200 100mg Nucynta pills. For reference, one pill is equal to 20mg of Oxycodone. I don't think I have the willpower to throw them away. And I don't really have any friends in my current city I can sell them to. I could visit back home and probably sell all of them and make a lot more than I paid. 

TL;DR? Polysubstance addict who just got prescribed Klonopin to come off Etizolam and is getting referred to the Suboxone maintenance program to kick Kratom. This feels like a life-changing decision! I'm just not sure if it'll be for the good or the bad... Should I work with the docs and give Suboxone a try, seeing as it's helping my partner so much and I'm sick of how I'm living currently?",3

Started off with clonazolam, then some time ago switched to flubromazolam to start tapering. 
So far I've went from 0.4mg flam per day to less than 0.2mg, usually around 0.1-0.15mg without experiencing pretty much any withdrawal symptoms. This took approximately 2 months, which is not the fastest but given the fact I'm not in a hurry and doing it without doctors help (no need to tell me it's dumb, I just can't afford it and won't be able to for at least next 4 months. Also I doubt many doctors in my country are familiar with flam and how to go about translating it's doses to prescription benzos) I'd wager it a success. 
For the last four days or so I've went down to 0.1mg tops, perhaps even a bit less. So far so good, no terrible symptoms, some issues falling asleep but after I manage to do it I usually sleep for 8-10 hours easily, no anxiety, no excessive sweating, pretty much nothing. But given that flubromazolam has such a long half life I expect that it still might be too early to say that I've lowered my dosage successfully.

Since I'm doing it on my own I'm trying to be extremely careful. Obviously the thing I'm most afraid of is having a seizure bc the chance someone will be around in time to call 911 is close to 0.
So my main questions are:
1. Can I still have a seizure even though I don't have any other symptoms? 
2. Will I feel it coming or is it just random with no warning signs (I've found conflicting information)?
3. I'm prescribed Mydocalm (Tolperisone) which is a skeletal muscle relaxant, I take it very rarely, only when I feel that my back condition (for which it was perscribed) is acting up again. But since it's a muscle relaxant I'm curious - could it be any help in avoiding a seizure?",10

I have been off benzoids for 2 months now. Obviously it was not easy, still isn't. I believe I did something to make it harder.
I know this road can be lonely for many. Im not married. During my lows I looked for any one for comfort. I met a man who was relatable. We chatted every night and I became used to it. He became a support system for me.
Feelings arose and when I started to feel better we went on a few dates. It felt great. Someone to dress up for, to be normal with. I became happy.
After our third date and feeling myself fall deeper I started getting ruminating thoughts. Felt like he might be lying to me. Seeing other women possibly. I couldn't control them.
I left him voice texts accusing him of lying. Needless to say this made me look crazy since it was only 3 dates. He became mad and now has ended everything, including the friendship.
The past 2 days all my anxiety and depression has returned. I have not slept and its taking everything not to take a benzoid.
I guess why I'm writing is to acknowledge this. That how important it is not to get involved emotionally during recovery. To try to heal first.
I obviously was not ready and used this person's attention to get through this when I needed to fight the fight solo.
I'm praying I can rise again. I feel like a fool which isn't doing me any favors. If any of you have gone through this or are, I know how it feels. I guess it makes us human.",5

I'm not having any positive wave, emotions are dead, have fear to go outside,  heavy hypersensibility, feel like I'm inside a bubble, feel High like I'm under some kind of hallucination. I have developed a massive anger because I feel I cannot do anything to stop this symtom, going outside to have a walk in the nature became a Nightmare because of my constant feeling that Im not connected to my body, same symptoms that I use to have before starting to take Chlonopin (1mg x day), It used to do the job honestly and Im regretting that I stopped, my Gf Is taking care a lot of me but in the sametime She calls me a junkie. The point Is that I feel that my problem Is not the whitdrawal but Is some thing connected to my senses and feelings that I messed It up years ago using lots of cannabis and hallucinogenic substances sutch Lsd, mushrooms, mdma.
In these 3 months I have never been so sober in my life, doing daily phisical excercises, grounding, meditation, taking many vitamins and supplements sutch as magnesium, Nac, Zinc, Lithium orate, Apigenin, VitaminB/D.
I see None of this Is helping me. 
The only good thing that is giving me a bit of motivati in Is music, I'm a electronic music composer, I do It Daily and enjoing as well!

My question is if this will be enough. He used a chart and said this 15mg of Valium is equal to 1.5mg of Xanax per day (approx). I am wondering what to expect when I switch over fully and if this seems like a dosage that will allow for a smooth transition. I still have some xanax so if the transition will not be smooth I can take a little xanax each day until my body gets used to the valium..  Any tips are appreciated.  Thanks-,3

She wants to drop me down to .25mg in a month for two weeks and then take .25mg every other day until I'm done with the bottle. She said I should be fine and won't have bad withdrawal. 

Am I being overdramatic in thinking that this will not be the case? I've done slow tapers before and they were awful, I can't imagine what this fast taper will feel like. Should I see a different doctor? Maybe an addiction specialist? Are my concerns all in my head? How does one find a doctor that knows their shit when it comes to benzos? Any input would be very helpful!",5

She took me to the hospital and then rehab. I stayed in rehab for 30 days. Doctor started to taper me off klonopin but I got this really bad akathisia and akathisia was the reason I got on benzos, so she couldn't take the benzos off. So I get off rehab and turns out her and my mom made an agreement to get me off benzos. My mom gave me my pills everyday and hid the other pills from me. I was supposed to take klonopin in the morning and she woke me up everyday to give me my pills and I didn't even see what I was taking because I was sleepy af. Anyway, I've been home for about a week and I just realized I haven't been taking benzos and I felt nothing, like absolutely nothing, no akathisia, no withdrawal or anything. But how stupid is the doctor and my mom? I could have died from withdrawal. What kind of doctor doesn't know that? I'm pissed off, but I'm glad I didn't feel anything and glad I'm sober.",2

It's no excuse but I'm sure like a lot of people am having a pretty rough couple months/life. I should have called my doctor first and explained how bad I was feeling but instead upped my meds. Between a recent move, my mother passing away a few weeks ago, unemployment issues in NJ (they put me on hold for 8weeks due to someone using my SS#) and the stress of job searching has my at my breaking point. Still extremely irresponsible. 

I called my doctor and will speak with him at noon today. When I called I had explained the dilemma and was honest. I'm not sure if it's going to bite me or if there is a way for them to help. I've been a patient for over 3 years and have never done this. When I got over confident and wanted to stop the meds last year I flushed them n the withdrawals were undescribable (this is coming from a ex heroin addict). Just needed a place to vent and i guess I'll see what happens when I speak with him. I know the dangers involved in cold turkey detox with these meds n should have been more careful. Worst case I go through hell, best case he helps me figure something out.

2021-06-07 02:04:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nu5esm/looking_for_advice_about_what_to_do_about_my/,Looking for advice about what to do about my doctor.,"I'll try and keep this as concise as possible: I spoke with a doctor at the family practice I go to recently about tapering off benzos (not my usual doctor; they have been juggling me around for some reason between doctors). Everything he said was spot on; switching to a longer acting benzo, taking up to a year to do it, etc. 

I recently decided to take him up on that offer, so I made an appointment and... got a different doctor, who IMO prescribed me a horrible taper. 0.25mg Xanax 4x/day and lowering it from there. I suggested switching to valium or klonopin, and he had to Google whether or not klonopin even lasted longer than Xanax (it has a MUCH longer half-life), somehow decided they were similar, and just stuck with Xanax. He also said if I can't stick to this prescription we were ""done"". What the hell happened to the hippocratic oath? 

It sucks because my blood concentrations aren't consistent, and even worse, 0.25mg doesn't really touch my anxiety (0.5mg is my ""threshold"" for relief), so I'm in relative agony 24/7. Even if it did relieve me, Xanax 4x/day is only 12-16 hours of ""coverage"" a day and the remaining hours would suck. IMO, this could eventually work to get me off benzos, but puts me in unnecessary agony and is an overall poor taper plan. I don't expect this to be easy peasy but I can't sleep and am never comfortable. 

I want the other doctor. I think he was much more informed and capable of getting me through this. 

But, what do you think they will do if I try and make an appointment with a different doctor at the same clinic for the same reason? Should I try and go that route or just try and stick this out? What do you think of this taper?

Should I try a different office completely? 

Advice is appreciated,
Thanks.",8

After that night i raised it back to the half of 0.25mgs. Went through an intense week of withdrawal, nausea, a lot of twitches, arm numbness. They mostly subsided by now (maybe 1.5 weeks later), but i still can't feel my arm a lot of times. 

But i thought i was over these mostly, but then now, tonight i had the same thing happen with my left side! I couldn't even sleep back because it would go numb. It was horrifying. What is this??

Please help?,"I'll try to keep this short. I'm a big guy, 6""2 and 11 stone with a psychological dependance to Benzodiazepines (self medication for diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder.)

My use has been pretty constant over the last three weeks in doses daily, ranging from 4MG-8MG (a few days ago I took 14MG and yesterday I took 22MG, recreationally, which is a rarity.)
These are pharmaceuticals and I am aware these are mammoth doses. Even combined with alcohol, I only got a little buzz. I am also scripted 2MG Buprenorphine daily (I am a veteran benzo user and know the dangers of the opiod, benzo, alcohol combo.)

I'm planning on taking 0.5mg (3x daily) for a week, then dropping to 0.5mg (2x daily) on the second week, then 0.25mg and eventually 0.125mg before jumping off.

I have the supply and the willpower. My strange 'binge' behaviour results in minimal withdrawal but a strong compulsion to take more alprazolam and dependance issues (it still works for my anxiety.)

This is only anacdotal but Xanax has a short half-life and I last dosed (shamefully 22MG last night as a last hoorah.) I don't feel the interdose withdrawals I've heard of and don't get sick or shakey. I assumed the W/D symptoms would appear 6 hours or so after I took my last dose. 

 I've started my taper and taken 0.5mg at 10:00am today and will take another 0.5mg at 15:00pm, then the third 0.5mg dose at 20:00.
It's a big jump from 4-8MG so I'm hoping it holds me.

If this works I'll be clean in three weeks and can use PRN rather than daily

Edit: Could 0.5mg 3x daily hold me considering the prolonged and high level usage? I'll update. 

That would be bliss (if only for my BZ1&2 receptors.)

I was using Xanax & Bromazolam which is very identical, at Xanax doses let's say 4mg/day for a month (whole May). 8 days ago I started tapering, started from 1.75mg and reached 0.5mg within a week. Every time I tried to stop Xanax, I had severe muscle stiffness, and a stupid voluntary extreme muscle stiffness in my neck that wouldn't let my head move to certain directions, which made me look like a victim of car accident or like I've been sitting under an air conditioner to full cold mode. I suffer from severe social anxiety, and for some reason the anxiety was making my neck muscles to be so stiff and looking like a retard. I noticed that it was voluntary, when I took some 2F-Ketamine and it was released 100%, (2F/Ketamine analogues are not muscle relaxers) realizing it was voluntary and when you loose body control with Ketamine/Analogues I was free from that stupid voluntary muscle neck lock.

Yesterday, a friend I haven't seen a long time invited me to go out as he was passing by my town, and urged me to go out with him and a couple of his friends, because he is moving to another European country. In this messy situation, I didn't have many options apart from A)ignoring his invitation whe would seem bad to him b) Take benzos c)drink a massive amount of alcohol.

I chose option B. Reached almost 4mg of Xanax as lower doses did completely nothing.

My question is, how to continue with tapering ? I was between 0.37-0.5mg daily during the 7th and 8th after stopping it (I know, it was too fast that's why the severity of withdrawals.) Should I start again today from a bigger doses like 1mg ? Or should continue from 0.5mg for a couple of days and keep dropping it ? Or any other suggestion you have would be helpful. Thanks!",3

I lost someone in February to suicide due to so many things she was going through in life while trying to withdraw from xanax. I always fight autocorrect on that word because I don‚Äôt feel it deserves to be capitalized. 
She was someone I was the other half to. We were best friends since we were 9. She taught me how to spit properly on our first time hanging out. We walked the pastures and timber where I lived and went under a bridge and she scoffed at how I couldn‚Äôt spit. She made it fly! 

We spent years laughing over everything, being split up in class. Our names became interchangeable. When one was mentioned the other was assumed. We were obnoxious in our pursuit of laughter. I was always laid back and she was always wound tighter than an 8 day clock. She was fucking brilliant in every way but how she would worry about the 8th grade constitution test! Or any number of things. Her brain would not quit. Would not let her relax. She always had severe depression and anxiety that no pill could touch. She told me she could remember being depressed at 5 years old. But she always laughed. Always was kind. 

She was, Im not exaggerating, just flat out stunning beautiful. She hit that stride in her early 20s. Just drop dead gorgeous. And she never once thought so. She always felt inferior in her looks and in her life. In her life, she was by all accounts, talented, kind, beyond hilarious, stunningly gorgeous, and natural. She loved nature and animals, history and psychology. She shunned technology. Hard. To the point she never had a smart phone, never had access to all of you. I‚Äôve read all of your posts and know so many of them she would be goddamned thankful for. 


She was on x for 20 years or so. Had 3 suicide attempts. Every word I see on here, every struggle, I see what she was saying, see better how she was feeling. I came so close to getting her an iPhone and hooking her up with Reddit. If I‚Äôd only not waffled. If she‚Äôd seen your stories she would have known she wasn‚Äôt alone. When she was coming off xanax I didn‚Äôt know the term benzodiazepine.  Just what she had told me and asked me to google for her. Like was this fucking normal? She thought she had ALS. She would describe how her day was as ‚Äú panic and dread‚Äù. She drew away from me in the months leading up to her death. She was angry. On one phone call she sounded nothing like herself. She was so pissed at the world, at doctors at her family. At life. I was scared and didn‚Äôt recognize her. Later that day I called her back and said * I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre angry. You can be angry and I‚Äôll still love you. You can say what you want. 
She was relieved because I had not known what to say or how to respond to her earlier. She was an alien on that call. 
If I‚Äôd known all of you then! If I‚Äôd known that there is another side. There is a coming out of this. I could have helped her. Saved her. 

I have to stop now bc my phone isn‚Äôt typing right- all slow like it‚Äôs broken.... and this may not be allowed here anyway and all my typing will be for nothing. Just know- if you‚Äôre trying to get off benzos, someone here in the sticks of nowhere loves you and wants you to get better. Someone here lost someone to xanax. I know it‚Äôs not about me, but I do fight this pain every day.",18

Frequency - Twice a week, VERY rarely three times a week

How long? - 1-2 years with long week breaks in between 





Hello everyone, I‚Äôm looking for any advice possible on what I should do and how worried I need to be, I‚Äôm 22 years old. I decided to stop on May 22nd which was about two weeks ago. 

I went the first 5 days fine until May 27th my brain started worrying about having a seizure. I started messaging multiple people  and I got mixed answers from saying it‚Äôs fine to CT to ‚ÄúYou need to taper or you‚Äôll have a seizure.‚Äù

This latter made me panic like crazy even more so I took 0.5mg on May 27th.

Again, on June 2nd (6 days later) I was struck with another deadly fear of having a seizure from withdrawl and did the same thing and was met with conflicting answers once again, so I took 0.5mg again. 

Today again June 4th, I was extremely panicked at the thought of having a seizure and took another 0.5mg.

I don‚Äôt know if my anxiety is from withdrawl or from fear of having a seizure and dying. The ONLY symptoms I‚Äôve had on the days when I haven‚Äôt taken Etiz is anxiety and heart palipations. Occasionally I think I‚Äôll see something in the corner of my eye but it‚Äôs just my hair. 

If I were to taper I was thinking of doing 0.5mg twice a week for a month, then the next month 0.25mg twice a week, then 0.125mg twice a week, then stopping? 

My main and biggest concern as to why I keep taking it is creating anxiety attacks 
over the possibility of having a seizure. It terrifies me to my core that I‚Äôll be home alone and die or driving or at work and just collapse. Otherwise, I have no need for Etizolam, I‚Äôve quit CT in the form of taking breaks many times over the last 1-2 years but I want to stop all together and safely as possible.",2

(aka my wild saga of trying to get below 0.25 Klonopin),"Today is 11 months since my Last Good Day, aka the last day before I was hit with BAD withdrawal symptoms, which have hung on in some form ever since. Despite this less-than-great milestone, I'm making good progress on my taper.

Settle in for... A Klonopin Story. 

I really thought I was one of the lucky ones. I had taken Klonopin (along with several other psych drugs) for several months in college, to help me stay in school after an awful bout of panic attacks, insomnia, and near-agoraphobia. It worked. I graduated, and I CTed all the drugs and didn't think about them again for a long time.

I started taking Klonopin again in early 2017 -- this was about 85% from insomnia triggered by a certain world event (tbh, most of my anxiety over the course of my life has come from things outside my personal life), and the rest from dealing with the release of my first book alongside working in management full-time, being a parent, and trying to write another book. What a RELIEF it was to sleep again. I was taking 1 mg a day, prescribed by my doctor. He might have warned me about not taking it every day -- I really don't know. The day I came to see him, I think I had gone close to 48 hours with no sleep, so the only thing I heard was that he would prescribe the med.

Eventually I started to find 1 mg too sedating, so I started cutting my pills in half. No issues at all. I did the same thing the next year, after I had started on the 0.5mg pills. I cut those in half in early 2019 and took 0.25mg per day. With that cut, I had a few days of disturbed sleep, but nothing too weird.

My mom -- who had dealt with awful CNS disturbances after coming off a blood pressure med and a beta-blocker -- began warning me about Klonopin. (Me: ""It's fine, it's a low dose!"") I started Googling and finding all the rehab websites and warnings and stories. (How did I, an inveterate Googler of EVERYTHING, not know about the potential effects of the med I'd been taking? Sheesh. Hopefully this tome of a post will help anyone Googling for 0.25 Klonopin.) In spring 2020, I had a telehealth checkup with my doctor, who was surprised I was still on the Klonopin, and told me I should stop taking it. 

Sometime in June 2020, I found this sub. Around the same time, I realized the 0.25 wasn't doing much for me anymore -- insomnia and anxiety had returned, and I wasn't thinking too logically. I felt like making a jump from 0.25 to 0.125 would be OK, and then I'd go from 0.125 to 0.0 and I'd be DONE by the end of the summer. 

So that's what I tried. I cut my pills into fourths and started taking those. 

The symptoms hit exactly 2 weeks later. 

I was... unprepared, to say the least. 

Here are some of the symptoms I dealt with (in order of appearance):

**- insomnia**

**- chest constriction**

**- hypnic jerks**

\- **limb numbness**

\- **tremors**

\- **looping thoughts** 

I went to an urgent care and eventually the ER -- twice! -- about these symptoms. I had the full cardiac workup, including a CT scan. What did the doctors say, after I asked if these issues could be from my cutting Klonopin? ""No, this doesn't seem related."" But hey, let's keep doing tests for collapsed lung.

On my second visit to the ER, I realized they gave me an IV full of Ativan. And after I came home, I slept a beautiful, thick, dreamless sleep. Benzo sleep. That was, at last, the evidence I needed that this was benzo WD. Perhaps I should have kept toughing it out at the 0.125 dose. Maybe I would have stabilized eventually. But my anxious, looping thoughts wouldn't let me relax, particularly about my job. I was convinced if I couldn't get out of bed and make a deadline, I'd be out of a job. And the only way I saw to do that was to... go back to 0.25.

Except... this is where things get weird. I still wasn't in a good mental state (though I did hit my deadline and keep my job), and I kept changing things about my Klonopin dose. I switched to the dissolvable tablets, and I made sloppy cuts with a serrated knife in an attempt to get myself to 0.20. I'm sure I was all over the place... those dissolvables are tiny and hard to cut. And also, maybe I was trying to do to much. In the absence of the chest constriction and panic attacks, I felt like I had my life back. I went swimming, I spent several days cleaning my basement, I came back to being a person again.

The point is, after 2 weeks of relative loveliness, I fell off a cliff again, and it was worse this time.

***More fun symptoms!***

\- **hot ""flashes""** \-- these lasted for hours, and in one case, days

\- **abnormal sweating** \-- I had cold sweats from just the palms of my hands and the bottoms of my feet for a few days

\- **nighttime panic attacks**

\- **terror** \-- definitely thought I was dying

**- restless legs**

**- general flu-like feeling, including a cough and stuffy sinuses**

\- **earache**

\- **pulsating tinnitus**

**- tachycardia**

\- **altered sense of taste** \-- this happened about 2 months after the cut. I thought I had Covid for a while. You could not have talked me out of it. Nor did the 14 negative swabs and 2 negative antibody tests. 

\- **depression / weepiness**

With time, a lot of this stuff faded. What stayed extremely consistent are 4 things (I call these the ""Core 4"" now): POTS, hissing tinnitus, a jaw tremor, and visual floaters.

I went to see a functional / integrative doctor, as I was still not sure that my second round of horrible symptoms were related to benzos. After a round of blood work, she suggested I might have mold toxicity. But then, when I had my blood rechecked a few months later, she said I did not have mold toxicity. Argh. I sure would like to know if that second round of disaster would have happened had I not spent 3 days in July cleaning my basement. 

The mold question sent me into what I now think was a period of mania. I was convinced I needed to sell our house\*, our furniture, and most of my clothes. I finally started writing again -- late at night, writing strange essays about my family\*\*, and short fiction in the body horror genre. 

(\* = The house, luckily, didn't sell. There's still some empty space in the house where the dining room table and some easy chairs used to be.)

(\*\* = The irony that I have two not-terribly-extended family members who took part -- some would say, perpetrated -- the two most notorious neurotoxin-related events ever sponsored by the U.S. Government, is an irony that should be noted here. On my bad days, I think a lot about ancestral karmic justice.)

At this point, I had been back on the 0.25 for several months. And with my physical symptoms not getting any worse, I decided to finally start tapering Klonopin again.

I began a basic water taper (0.25 pill in 300 ml of water) on December 25, 2020. FINALLY, this past week, I got to the halfway point, that dosage that seemingly tried to end me -- 0.125 mg.

It's a victory, but a messy one, and one that comes with a certain calm-before-the-storm feeling. Because today, I'm feeling pretty good. I do have symptoms beyond those Core 4 now -- I have restless legs again, muscle twitches in my feet, and my sleep is inconsistent. But! I'm working my dayjob, I'm exercising every day, I'm writing another book, I read to my kid every day, we're planning some summer travel, and I'm baking all sorts of stuff (because a. it's fun, and b. my husband and kid deserve any and all baked goods after what I have put them through). 

And yet, I still have months ahead of me. If I've learned anything from this ordeal, it's that I need to taper this last bit super slowly and carefully. The water taper, though easy, can be inexact, so I think I may switch to a titration taper.

I think -- I hope -- that my neurotransmitters have begun their healing process. They had better be, after all of this, right? I'm dreaming again, almost every night, and my creativity is back. I cry at movies and get chills when I read a good line in a book. Maybe I'm closer to the end than I think. Maybe.",7

2014 I started the occasional use and abuse of Xanax to manage my anxiety (intially) and used it recreationally a bit as well. Never had a problem with it, could pick it up and stop with no issue... At first. 

2015 I had a week binge and when i ran out, i began having withdrawls that resulted in the worst panic attacks I ever had in my whole life. I went to my psychiatrist and she gave me script for 1mg Clonazepam twice daily. I mostly took it just as perscribed because I didn't want to experience what I felt from Xanax again. I can honestly say there was less than a handful of times over the years where I took my meds recreationally. I will say I had misused the pills at other times though, like mixing them with alcohol countless times and other substances, but never to get high, just to manage anxiety/prevent withdrawal symptoms. 

After a few years, I went down to 1mg a day and it wasnt too bad. A bit of discomfort, but i was alright. Just occasionally taking another .5 or something here or there if I felt anxious. After a while like that I tried going down to .5 a day. It was very uncomfortable. I could barely speak. It felt and sounded like I was struggling to breathe or something. My heart raced, i sweat a lot, I felt panic, fear and just crawling out of my skin. So i went back up to 1mg and for a short period, 1.5 to 2mgs. I then went back to 1mg (.5 twice daily) and was managing, but not feeling great. I then discovered (unfortunately- I'd say in hindsight probably) kratom. This stuff **appeared** to be the the best thing ever. I was able to drop my bupropion completely and go back down to .5mg clonazepam once daily for many months with what i thought was the help of kratom. Maybe it did help, but its dependance is a whole huge post on its own, so I'll leave it out from here, besides that I would NOT recommend to addicts who are not trying to kick opiates (just my opinion).

Anyway, essentially I was able to maintain this .5 mg protocol for a while and I occasionally went back up to 1mg a couple a times during stressful times, but could return to .5 mgs with reletive ease. I eventually felt i could drop down further and tried several times, but always failed and went back. It felt like I was doomed to be a benzo slave...

I eventually ended up on sertraline in 2020, which I was very hesitant to try, and it was a rough start but it eased off nicely and i felt more calm in general. (This too is another story but i just want to be clear on what I had personally done, and I also understand this doesn't mean this would help everyone, by any means.) So, after that leveled out and i made some life changes, i decided to ween down on the clonazepam again. I split my tablets into 3rds for two weeks, taking one 3rd at night. Then, I split them into quarters and did .25 mg st night for like 2-ish months. Then, I took the .25 mg every other day, which turned to every 4 days at some point. I did feel some ""edginess"", i guess I could call it? Some restlessness, insomnia and mild almost dissociation-like feelings, but not much panic. Anxiety? Yeah, that was there, but not panic. It was neat.

After a few weeks at .25mg every 4-ish days, I dropped the clonazepam entirely for the first time. 1 week no pills was a crazy idea, but I did that. Then, two weeks no clonazepam. Holy shit! I had a spike in restlessness and anxiety at this point, but fairly manageable! Then, this week I hit 3 weeks! Which seems nuts to me and I feel pretty dang good, all things considered. Some weird feelings here and there, but not crazy discomfort by any means.

I hope this is goodbye to these drugs. I know many of you may think coming off such a low dose seems easy, and I'm sure it would be for some, but I still certainly struggled a lot, but I've come far in my mind and I feel that if i can quit ciggerettes and now **hopefully** clonazepam, I can do mostly anything. Which means, so can those of you struggling with addiction to these types of drugs. 

There is hope. Don't give up. Be patient and careful is my advice. Again, who knows if this is it for me, but I feel if i can make it this far, I'm done... I hope.

Thanks for the support you guys share in this sub. It helped lurking around here. Just to keep my mind on getting off benzodiazepines.

All the best everyone. I'll try to post another update as time goes on!",32

Yes they were real alprazolam but they were still bars from a Mexican pharmacy not like I was taking it legally, though from what I have seen you can end up in the same situation from taking as prescribed.

Anyway so far I have felt somewhat crummier but I don‚Äôt think I won‚Äôt be able to handle this, the insomnia will be the worst part because it makes the withdrawal even more disphoric once I go multiple days no sleep. I still have to go to work, but I just gotta do this. I spent a month and a half tapering, it was a brutal taper. I actually don‚Äôt feel as bad as I did when I dropped from 4.5 to 1mg.

Things are not great but I am trying to be positive because once a week passes I should be more stable, even if I am still withdrawling I noticed my tapering symptoms peak during the first few days then start to subside hoping the same holds true for jumping off.",3

So I've been progressively trying to taper on my own. I'm down from 2 MG a day to 1.25 MG but honestly it took me like a year to get down.

Here's a link to Parker's 'What is happening in your brain? [ **What is happening in your brain**](http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php?topic=232042.0)

The following is a full copy of the text:

This will hopefully be an encouraging email to make you feel SAFE and ENCOURAGED.

As some of you may know, my degrees are in speech-language pathology (B.A and M.S.)

As part of my Masters study, a big portion of my classes were in neuroanatomy and physiology.

I learned firsthand how to look at a person who had just undergone a stroke or brain injury and read the symptoms, the radiology reports, the doctor's notes,  and based on those symptoms, to form an image in my mind of what was affected in the brain injury - as well as how to formulate a treatment plan to help that person rehabilitate. For a therapist in a hospital, it is much more than ""speech and language"". It is about reteaching how to swallow, eat,  rebuilding memory, rebuilding concentation and attention, rebuilding focus, rebuilding executive functioning skills (planning and acting on a plan) -pretty much ANYTHING that is involved in ""thinking"" that helps you get OUT of a coma, OUT of a hospital, and back to life, work, and school. 

I had NO idea I would ever personally undergo a brain injury.  But insomuch as I have now indeed endured one, I often laid there in waves and attempted to ""analyze and decipher"" what was happening in my brain as I healed. I thought you all might like to read this. It gives potential answers to all the ""WHY?"" questions we have about what is happening to us mentally.

First of all, a TRUTH to accept is that WE HEAL.  I have seen people emerge from comas who cannot remember who they are - HEAL.

They can't remember how to walk (we do).

They can't write their names (we can).

They cannot tell you the year or the president (I was SO bad I was unsure of this at times, but generally, I was oriented to this).

They often cannot remember family members (we can -our D/R can be hideous, but we remember them).

THEY have to work through many hours of therapy to heal. But most of them do - and from TRAUMATIC PHYSICAL brain trauma that can tear tissue and tear nerves.

We have none of that. We don't have to undergo therapy. We simply have to wait.

Most of us, me included, didn't expect the temporary ""brain injury"" we got when jumping off benzos.

But I am starting to realize through my own experience and my educational background, that there is a PURPOSE in every symptom we have.  I have had months and months to analyze what is likely going on in the brain at a gross level - and I want to attempt to explain certain symptoms in a way that we can visualize - so that they are less ""scary"" and more ""telling"" of the healing that is happening.

First off - let's start with GABA and Glutamate. Most of you may know how this works by this point. But for those that don't, we have a huge nervous system of millions of nerves (neurons).  They don't ""touch"" each other. They are separated by a tiny space in between. However, they communicate via chemicals. The 2 MAIN chemicals in the entire nervous system are the BIG GUNS.  They are GABA and Glutamate. They are BOTH at work at ALL times in the CNS.  It isn't like one is working and then the other is working. They are BOTH ALWAYS working in tandem to control every aspect of movement, sensation  - everything. They take the incoming information and appropriately pass it along - they ""trim up"" the information appropriately so that we can process it.  They are like the steel structure of a building.  The entire building needs a steel structure to stand. 

GABA is inihibitory.  If a nerve releases GABA - it is to Inhibit function - this could be to ""slow it down"" or it could be to ""limit the sensory input"" so that we can process it.  In the same way, GABA might be released to help ""steady"" your hand while doing something like painting a very detailed painting.  GABA ""shores up"" movements to make them more fluid.   That's just in a nutshell. Of COURSE it does a lot more than this, but the idea is that GABA is present in the ENTIRE CNS and ALWAYS working to balance every sensation, movement, etc.

Likewise, Glutamate is the balance to GABA. It is the ""excitatory"" transmitter. It fires to speed things up - to initiate action - to make things ""go"".  There's a lot more to it, but Glutamate is kinda the opposite of GABA.   

BOTH are required to work at all times.  Neurons are ALL ALWAYS firing off GABA and Glutamate on a endless cycle all throughout the nervous system. It's quite amazing really.

What does a benzo do?  If a person is anxious - they may be so stressed that they cannot overcome a very traumatic event or anxious situation.  If a doctor prescribes a benzo - the benzo comes in and sorta ""holds the door open"" for ALL the GABA in the system to FLOOD into the nerves - even when that is not what the nerves would actually want to occur. The immediate effect is that EVERYTHING ni the body SLOWS DOWN and is inhibited. This might be helpful during surgery, for anesthesia, for a seizure disorder.  Yes - the benzo - by definition - will act on GABA and ""slow everything down"".  And yes - the net effect of this is that a person may feel drowsy, calm, less anxious... everything is being inhibited.    And in general, taking a benzo for ""one day""  is okay. When the benzo is gone, the body just reverts back to regular operation.

HOWEVER, if a person takes a benzo day after day,  while indeed the person feels less anxious, the body begins to realize that it cannot DO the things it needs to do in this very slowed-down neuron state. It cannot make hormones. It cannot create enzymes. It cannot digest correctly. It cannot keep a heart going efficiently. It cannot get enough oxygen- and on and on. The body NEEDS to run at ""normal"" speed - not this ""inhibited speed"" all slowed down. 

But what can the body do? It cannot ""remove the benzo"" from the system. The only choice the body has to maintain a regular speed is to do two things ..  It can TURN OFF it's own GABA receptors - thereby rendering those benzos unable to affect the GABA in the system. And it can grow MORE excitatory Glutamate receptors to counteract the slow-down.  And that's kinda exactly what happens....

Only - this isn't true balance either.  The body does the best it can - but over time, things begin to suffer.  The body cannot make enough serotonin in this state. Or dopamine. Some things get made in excess - and other things do not get made enough!  During this time, a person may not be aware this is all going on. He may not be able to perceive any difference. But ONE day - the person may wake up sad - or not sleeping well - or unable to remember things fully - or his vision doesn't look right....and it becomes apparent the person has ""hit tolerance"".  The body is taking the same amount of drug -but try as it might, it just cannot overcome what has occured. It can take weeks, months or years to hit tolerance. Some people do and some don't before trying to get off benzos.  (I did. - it took me 9 months to hit tolerance.  But it was fast.  Once I hit it, I could notsleep more than 6 hours on all that klonopin AND Ambien! I couldn't remember things last week. I was crying all the time... something was wrong.)

The process to reverse this takes a while.  GABA receptors have to UPregulate and effectively ""reopen"" or ""grow back"".  Glutamate receptors must DOWNregulate, or effectively ""turn off"" or ""prune back"".  And IN this mix, all the smaller monoamines (neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) must somehow find a way to synthesize in the mix.  Through weeks and months the body is rebuildling millions of neurons, and changing pathways, rebuilding GABA, downregulating Glutamate, rebuilding serotonin, rebuilding dopamine, rebuilding norepinephrine.  And ALL the enzymes and hormones that need to be made are attempting to be made while this is going on.  Basically- you have a building where the MAJOR streel structures are trying to be rebuilt at different times - ALL while people are coming and going in the building and attempting to work.

It would be like if the World Trade Center Towers hadn't completely fallen - but had crumbled inside in different places.. Imagine if you were trying to rebuild the tower - WHILE people were coming and going and trying to work in the building!  You'd have to set up a temporary elevator - but when you needed to fix part of that area, you'd have to tear down that elevator and set up a temporary elevator somewhere else. And so on. You'd have to build, work around, then tear down, then build again, then work around, then build... ALL while people are coming and going, ALL while the furniture is being replaced, ALL while the walls are getting repainted... ALL while life is going on INSIDE the building. No doubt it would be chaotic. That is EXACTLY what is happening with windows and waves.  The windows are where the body has ""got it right"" for a day or so - but then the building shifts and the brain works on something else - and it's chaos again while another temporary pathway is set up to reroute function until repairs are made. 

And just like the Twin Towers- it's possible - but the buiding is a major effort -and it takes a good year or more sometimes. üì∑

(Now look at the new Tower that stands at Ground Zero!  It's taller, stronger, and a symbol of freedom.  JUST like you will be!  üì∑)

So - okay - what is happening in that chaos?  What parts of the brain are responsible for these symptoms? 

Now, I don't ""know"" the following based on research, because not enough research has been done yet  - but based on my studies in neuroanatomy and my own withdrawal experiences, here is how I have analyzed what is ""happening"" during wave symptoms. Remember, I have had to look at radiology reports of brain damage and estimate what a patient might present with - so this is very similar. Instead of a radiology report showing me what has been damaged, I'm using my own brain symptoms to surmise what is going on....

Let me first list brain structures and their functions. This will help you understand where things happen in the brain and when symptoms occur, what may be happening.

**BRAIN STRUCTURES**

\- **amygdala**  \- This is the FEAR center in the brain. It's a tiny part in the middle of your brain. Fear is protective and it's GREAT if you need to assess something that is dangerous and to ACT  - like if a rabid dog were chasing you. - but it's hard in recoveyr when it's all you feel for months! But the FEAR is not truly in your MIND. It's in your BRAIN.  There is too much glutamate acting here in the amygdala and not enough GABA. So the nerves are firing off in the fear center when nothing scary is really there in your environment.  It is normal for that to happen given the circumstance physiologically. But it feels awful, doesn't it?  I know.  But it's just a brain structure. This can account for fear, agoraphobia, fear of water, fear of anything.  It's not that you're really ""scared"" of the moon - it's that you're in \[...\] constant fear because this brain structure is healing. The glutamate is pruning back. The GABA receptors are opening back up.  It may or may not continue for awhile. It will abate. Then come back. But eventually, the brain will get it right.  üì∑

\-**Hippocampus** \- This is the ""memory"" center of the brain. It ties in old memories to emotions.  The same thing is happening here that is happening in the amygdala with GABA and Glutamate. So - voila. You get intrusive memories from ALL times in your life.  It's wild and wicked and wooly. But it can't hurt you. And if you can learn to visualize this as what is happening - then you can learn to be objective and realize it's normal.  And like the amygdala - it will come and go and frustrate you, but it will go away when the physiology is restored.

**Hypothalamus** This is the structure that is responsible for regulating body temperature. In early withdrawal, my body temperature would drop to 96 degrees in waves! Then 3 hours later, it would return to normal. I'd literally freeze in terror in bed for hours.  I am sure it is more complicated that JUST the hypothalamus, but I could picture this part of my brain retuning and restructuring, and it was less scary that way.

The following structures in the brain are part of the ""gray matter"" or the ""cortex ""and what we consider to be the ""higher brain""- the thinking and processing parts.

**Frontal Lobe** This is the part of the brain behind the front of the skull. It is responsible for planning things. For making decisions. For inhibiting emotions appropriately.  It is the part of the brain you need if you want to make a sandwich and need to get out the ingredients and actually make the sandwich. I have seen people with brain injury be able to TELL you how to make a sandwich - but when they are standing there in front of all the ingredients, they cannot actually move to act to make it! They have frontal lobe damage. They can TELL someone how to make it. But they cannot themselves initiate doing it! As you can imagine, with therapy, and time to heal, this goes away. And we are a lot like this - but it goes away for us, too.  I could not organize my children't toys just 4 months ago.  Not a simple room of toys. I didn't know where to start and I literally could not mentally do it. I imagine this is partly why.  No frontal lobe GABA. üì∑ And too much Glutamate.   But now, check out this post I""m typing.  Obviously that changed. üì∑

This calms down and these things come back.

**Occipital Lobe** This is the vision center. t's at the back of your skull.   In \[...\], my nerves have been all wacked here. I see things as too bright - possible due to this lobe - and/or the actual visual nerves in the eyes.  But no doubt people ""see things"" that aren't there.  Vision is distorted. Things go blurry.  Colors are totally off.Brightness is off.  There are a hundred symptoms possible in vision alone!  But again - it's a matter of time.

**Vestibular System** This is the system of semi-circular canals in the inner ear that are responsible for making you feel balanced in space.  When this is ""off"" or damaged temporarily, you feel dizzy. Oh man, was I dizzy. Early off - I felt like I lived in a funhouse.  Over time, a combination of this vestibular system and my damaged visual system made things look like they were ""leaning"". To this day, one eye sees things ""correctly"" and the other eye sees things as SLIGHTLY leaning. And it's not that the eye itself is seeing them that way.  The healing vestibular system is working WITH the eye to ""tell"" the brain that that object looks like it is ""moving left-wards"" or ""leaning"". But it isn't.  In waves, this can happen bad - and then be GONE - poof - in a window. This is just the vestibular system healing. It's gotten WAY better.

**Temporal Lobe**  These lobes are on the side of your brain on each side near your ear. It makes up the whole left and ride side of your brain.  This is where auditory information is processed, including hearnig itself, but also the ""Meaning"" of what we are hearing, as well as part of speech and language, emotion, and buncha other stuff.  In early \[...\], someone was talking to me and I couldn't tell you what they said past the first sentence.  My auditory processing was ALL messed up.  I couldn't picture what a person was saying to me in real time - and by the time I caught up to them, I was lost and they were talking about something else! Also - When I was laying there in bed, I could ""hear"" things that weren't there in the noise of my box fan. I'd hear the fan blowing -but I also ""heard"" like sickening circus music. I believe this is because there is noise coming into my ear - but my brain cannot adequately ""prune"" what it is hearing at differnet frequecies because there is not enough GABA to inhibit it to create something meaninful.  There was all this ""noise"" and my brain was just firing off glutamate.  So instead of actually ""processing"" the noise - it was firing off ideas about what it was hearing - and they were ALL wrong.  I would be hearing what sounded like circus music - and at the same time, my poor brain was looking through my hippocampus to find all the memories I ever had of being at the circus - and then I'm reliving those memories- and at the same time, my amygdala is getting fired upon - so I'm in fear. So I'm a quivering mess of a person laying in the bed hearing and seeing things and remembering times in my childhood and scared to pieces.  Seriously? Yes - I felt crazy. But not in my MIND.  It was my BRAIN.  It's the BRAIN.  And it's normal. The structures in the brain are ""obligated"" to work this way.

That brings me to my next point... WHY do all of us in benzo \[...\] have generally the same symptoms? Well - it may make you feel calmer to realize that our brain structures are NOT broken. They are doing EXACTLY what they are supposed to do under the circumstances.  And all of our perceptions of what we are seeing, feeling, hearing- are normal because the parts of our brains that are firing off are doing so because a) They still DO work. b) They work just as they were intended to. c) They are actually healing as all this firing is going on. 

Why the depression and anxiety? It's so complicated, but this WHOLE system is interdependent. At that SAME time as ALL this stuff is going on, the entire body is trying to heal in every place GABA and Glutamate naturally act (uh - and that would be - EVERYWHERE).

The intestines, stomach, eye balls, skin, toenails - seriously - where do we NOT have nerves? 

Anything we didn't have as a pre-existing condition is fair game for being affected by the \[...\] that takes place. 

This includes the body's own ability to make serotonin that is required to feel ""balanced"" and ""happy"". And you guessed it. This is not being made very efficiently in a building that is under major construction. So - you may get a day or so of feeling good - and then - boom - that's gone until you can make enough serotonin.

Oh - and by the way - serotonin HELPS TELL THE NERVES WHEN TO RELEASE GABA AND GLUTAMATE! Ha!

So on top of needing GABA to make serotonin, you need serotonin to regulate the release of GABA into the system! 

How much more interconnected can you get?  God - it's a wonder it knows how to heal at all!  But it does!  Amazing to me, really.

This is just some limited information to give an idea of what is going on in neurophysiology.  Obviously this is very cursory and not super detailed. But there is a bigger point here than ""what parts of the brain are affected"". 

The point REALLY is - IF  YOU KNOW that symptoms are tied to parts of a NORMAL brain under reconstruction, then you can begin to rest a little more easy in your mind that under the circumstances, the symptoms themselves are a GOOD sign. 

Without intrusive memories - as awful as they are - especially when mixed with fear - but without them, your memory itself would not heal.  It IS healing - and when you are having intrusives, try to think of it that way.  Tap your finger to your temple and say to yourself, ""I know what this is. This is my hippocampus healing! Ha!"" Because it IS.  And if it were NOT healing, you would not be having those symptoms.  ANY part of the brain or body that needs to heal is going to ""experience"" something in the form of symptoms - and you are going to notice that. But it is part of  process that is inevitably returning to the balance that it could not achieve while we were still putting those pills in our mouths.  (And if you're tapering, this is still happening - just likely with less trauma than with what happened to me when I cold-turkeyed.)

So - when you have symptoms - know that symptoms themselves are a way for you to know that healing is taking place.

And finally - realize that the DRUG is GONE.  This is withdrawal - yes - okay -we call it withdrawal -  but it's really ""\[...\]"".

The benzos are gone. The ""evil drug"" is no longer there.  The symptoms that are left are not the ""enemy"". That's our brains doing the EXACT right thing. What's happening to our brain at this point is not the ""benzo beast"" üì∑ It's OUR BRAIN recovering.

Not to degrade anyone who calls it the benzo beast üì∑ - I get that. But just so you know - you're not really fighting a beast.

You don't even need to fight it.  Just wait it out. All that reconstruction is happening on your building.

And soon - the frame will be back standing, stronger than before. The furniture will be inside. The elevators will go all the way up to the top again.  üì∑ And the people can come and go and work like a well-oiled machine. 

Don't feel you need to fight the recontruction. It's just healing. And all that is happening to us is a sign of that.

Hope this helps somebody a little - or maybe a family member. 

And if you ARE a family member, please realize that those of us in \[...\] are no more in control of how we feel or what we experience than people who have undergone brain trauma in a car accident. Please be patient with us, because our brains are healing and we are in the process of reconstruction - and our function is temporarily enabled, then disabled, then enabled, then disabled again.  And that is totally normal and expected.  We can no more help that than a person can ""want"" to wake up out of a coma. It happens when the brain is able - and not out of sheer will.  But it does happen. So please stand by us and say loving things and reassure us every day. Notice our improvements and tell us what they are.  Encourage us when we feel good.  And when we don't, just hold us and hug us and tell us it will be okay.  Anything you would say or do for a family member that had had a car accident and a brain injury - please do that for us.  And be patient... we are getting there.

**ADDENDUM**

I got a great PM from a buddy asking **""What about the physical symptoms of pain?""** \- and think it deserves some theoretical attention.

I want to take some time to add some theories about PAIN and physical symptoms such as burning, akathisia, and tingling, prickling, and things that happen during \[...\] of this nature.

I will also add this as an addendum to the original post on page 1.

First off, let it be said that I can only ""theorize"" as to this, - I am not a doctor.  But I DO think logical theories are helpful because they give us a story and mindful logic to cope with in the MEANTIME as we are going through this.

So these are multiple sources of information that I'm tying together - some are from nerve regeneration, and some are from what we know about ""how the brain works"".  And some or ALL of this is likely going on when it comes to pain and skin/muscle sensations:

First off - I think a good quote comes from a Plastic Surgery practice that has published things on ""nerve regeneration after injury"". 

The quote follows:

**""The usual events associated with normal nerve regeneration can be painful. As the regenerating ends of the nerve, called sprouts, travel, they make contact with each other and with structural proteins. The neural impulses generated by this activity may be interpreted by your brain as pain. It should be expected that for the time period associated with nerve regeneration there may be pain sufficient to need therapy and/or pain medication. Just understanding that this is expected to occur, and is ""good pain'; or pain for a good reason, is enough to help many people adjust to its presence.  This condition is not just one of pain, but is associated with over activity of the sympathetic nervous system, so that the area of pain is a different color, like pink or purple, and is usually a different temperature, like cooler, than the surrounding non-painful skin.""** [ http://www.riversongplasticsurgery.com/pdfs/nerve\_injury\_nerve\_reconstruction\_recovery.pdf](http://www.riversongplasticsurgery.com/pdfs/nerve_injury_nerve_reconstruction_recovery.pdf)

Well- this article isn't talking about ""benzo - related nerve damage. It's talking about nerve damage caused by physical trauma of crushing, cutting, or compressing nerves. But what can we glean from it nonetheless?

We can assume that if the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the presence of pain related to healing nerves - AND IT IS- that it is also NORMAL for us to have pain as we are undergoing healing.

When I was in earliest \[...\], I would often get out of the shower and have pink spots all over my feet and my abdomen. At first they were bright pink for about 2 months - and then they faded out and I don't have them anymore.  I have no idea what they were - but they were NOT there 12 days prior to my rapid taper - and then they showed up.  The spots weren't symmetrical - they followed no pattern, but they were alway in the same place on my skin.  And only after getting out of the shower.  It is easy to see how the nervous system could be involved in skin redness, irritation, and weird feelings associated with \[...\].

Likewise, throughout \[...\], I've had and continue to have cooling, burning, prickling and occasional stabbing sensations. I've had it feel like my skin was ""wet"" when there was no water on it.  Again, though. This is all normal - and like the quote says above..""Just understanding that this is expected to occur, and is ""good pain'; or pain for a good reason, is enough to help many people adjust to its presence.""  It doesn't make the pain FEEL any better in the moment, but it does help us not to become anxious about it. It's normal.  And it's a sign of healing.

What about akathisia?

Well  - from the reading, the exact cause of akathisia is not 100% conclusive, but it seems to be related to dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic activity in the brain  (dopamine and norepinephrine or noradrenaline as it is also called). These are just neurotransmitters - and it doesn't look (to me) to be exactly conclusive WHY this happens - but akathisia can happen after the use of many psychoactive drugs- not just benzos - and likely because anything that alters brain chemistry can alter dopemine and norepinephrine. So - okay. That makes sense.  We all took ""brain altering"" drugs - and now some of us have akathisia.  Guess what?  It seems pretty normal!  It's not fun. But it's normal.  And it can come and go and then go away eventually.  For me, I didn't get akathisia at all until month 8. It was a surprise.  It was intense and awful. But it passed in a few weeks. Since then, I have had it off and on - but not to that degree.  And now - it's mostly just annoying.  Something as simple as a good hard cry in the bathtub can COMPLETELY remove it at times.  And other times, I just have to wait for a wave to pass. But all in all, from all this information - it's normal. And the fact that it's coming and going and I'm getting hit here and there - it's a sign that the wheels are turning up there in the noggin - and things are shifting and attempting to rebalance.  So if we can keep that quote in mind - it's normal - and while the sensation itself is very uncomfortable - if not painful - it can be regarded as a ""good pain"" if we are able to recognize that our feeling it means we have a brain and nerves that are regaining their abilities to function.

Likewise, as a scab heals over a wound, the new skin formin underneath can become ""itchy"". Why does this occur? Why does a scab itch?

""The itch of a healing wound is caused by the growth of new cells underneath the old scab. New skin cells would be growing underneath, and as they form a new layer of skin, then the scab becomes more tightly stretched over this zone of activity. This can make it feel itchy. The itch sensation for burn survivors may be a tingling feeling caused by nerves re-growing, or from dry skin caused by the lack of natural oil production since oil glands may have been damaged or destroyed by the burn. As the nerves grow and start to receive and send messages, they may create that itchy feeling. The skin in this area will be a lot less thick than everywhere else, so these new nerve cells will be under a lot more pressure. Itching is a sign of healing."" (Mayo Clinic)

As we can surmise, the umpteen bajillion sensation we have going on are not 100% conclusive in their origins....HOWEVER...

There IS a trend.

From what it seems like from all the reading...

NERVE REGENERATION CAN CAUSE UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS. As counterintuitive as it is,  HEALING CAN FEEL LIKE HURT. üì∑

But it's NOT further hurt or damage. It's the REVERSAL of damage. 

Um  - yeah - okay. Great - but what do I DO about it.

Pretty much the things that I have discovered that help through this healing are to ""CONFUSE"" the nerves as much as possible, IF possible. 

What? Confuse the nerves?

You know how you get a cut or an insect bite and you immediately press on it to make it feel less painful? What you are doing when you press or squeeze the area is ""desensitizing' the entire skin region of the cut by applying pressure to ALL the nerves in the area. That way, the ONE sensation of pain from the cut isn't the only thing your brain is feeling.  The pressure from pushing down on  ALL the nerves in the area helps to send multiple sensation to the brain to ""counteract"" the pain sensation.  And it works.

Similarly, other things can help ""confuse"" nerves:

\-Heat

\-Cold

\-Deep Pressure

\- Massage

\-creams like ""Icy Hot"" with menthol

All of these things have helped me cope in \[...\].

Let me take it one by one:

**Heat:** I took and STILL take hot baths \[...\] every day. In the peak of akathisia, I lived in the tub. üì∑  As hot as I could stand it really helped me. All the heat was ""overregistering"" in my brain and I was unable to feel the akathisia as much when in the tub. It was confusing the nerve signal and it was temporary relief.  I hated those days. But I got through them.  Likewise, a heating pad for pain was my friend a lot of the time. 

**-Cold -**  I used a cold washcloth on burning skin - and on my face and hands - and kept dipping it in ice water and applying it.  This is an easy one, but it helped. I had a wave with 3 days of ""fireface"" last month and all I could do was apply the washcloth, lay there and think about how ""this is healing"" and keep going. But the wave passed.

**Deep Pressure**  I use a 15 pound weighted blanket to sleep. I have for YEARS. I ordered it online. It has many pockets with little plastic balls equally distributed to create a very heavy blanket that creates ""deep pressure"". This kind of pressure is calming for anyone's nervous system. Occupational Therapists use it for children with autism, but people with anxiety can benefit from sleeping with one. And in \[...\], I was glad to have it.  I used it often together with a heating pad.  It took the edge off just long enough. 

**Massage** This one CAN be helpful - but sometimes not.  I used to ask my husband just to ""press down"" on my head or my legs.  Just press there. Don't rub.  My skin hurt too much to rub, but the deep pressure from pressing was helpful. Other times, the actual massage was a help for sore muscles.  I was too agoraphobic to schedule a REAL massage. LOL. But just this help from my family was nice to have.

**Creams** You're going to laugh, but there was a day that I put Vick's VapoRub on my face because my face was so HOT!  I figured if this is safe for my baby's skin, it's probably okay to try it on my face.  It worked! Oh man - my face felt SO good all day.  I used that for a few days until the wave passed.  I have also tried ""Icy Hot"" on my back when it was sore.  Things like this work on the same principal to ""confuse the nerves"".  If your nerves are too busy feeling the heat/cool of menthol, they cannot simultaneously feel ""pain"". So for a short time, the pain is not ""felt"" even though the ""soreness"" is technically still there.

All of these are ways I have coped.  I'm sure there are others you guys have used!! üì∑

The broad idea here is that

1) Healing is happening.

2) The sensations that feel like injury are NOT injury. They are the CORRECTION of nerve injury.  They just ""fire off"" as they heal.

3) We can use some things to cope.

4) It's going away in time.

I know this is not a ""fix"" to the feelings.  There is nothing anyone could say to me while I was IN pain that made the PAIN better.  All I could do was cope and cry and try to get through it.  But knowing it's normal and that I'm not getting worse; I'm getting better - is always something I benefit from knowing. 

I still get these symptoms - and I'll be SOOOOOO glad when they are gone.

Thanks to the Benzo Buddy that brought this up.  üì∑

After going back and fourth with my dr for months and me getting worse we decided to go back on but im only taking 1mg when I wake up and 1mg later in the day. Im not taking the 3rd she dont know but its there if i need it. Partially cus I don't want to reach tolerance again. And if I can go with out it I will. But im still having severe anxiety and trouble with my day to day energy levels and getting depressed.  Is it better for me to take all 3mgs to be dosed around the clock. Or is my anxiety and depression coming from somewhere else? Im currently on Celexa but only 10mg because I weaned down to change over meds so basically its not doing anything but keeping me from withdrawling from it. I guess what im asking is should I try to establish anxiety and depression relief with another antidepressant or is the benzo causing me to suffer these symptoms more? Keep in mind I went on the benzo because of my anxiety and now I feel like I have nothing helping my baseline anxiety. I have anxiety 247 even after dosing my benzo just not as bad and I have 0 motivation to complete task or enjoy life. So mabye should I establish another antidepressant before tapering off of the klotapin?? So confusing. Please help any advice helps.,1

Now i feel pretty good on this combination and experience no withdrawal.  But as soon as i try to sleep al hell breaks lose , i get such extreme jolts that it gets scary . Now i know what hypnic jerks are they are common but this is absolute madness . It feels like my heart stands still and my brain fries away and i get such extreme shocks that i fear for my life for a small moment . But as soon as i sit up again i feel fine and relax and no withdrawal . Why does heart rate etc goes up when i try to sleep and feel like withdrawal comes up or something but not feeling any withdrawal when i am just awake ? I am asking this on this sub because this must be a universal thing with any gaba withdrawal , and i know benzos can be the worse out of all drugs to come off.  I hope i can get a answer from some one with knowlage and experience cause i cant post my question anywhere else.

I have been weaning off of Zoloft because it really didn't help me very much after 4 months and titrating up to 100mg. It actually had me feeling much worse or feeling nothing and also killed my libido and sexual response. I am now off the Zoloft completely. 

The reason I mention that is that I have also, during the weaning process of the last 3-4 weeks, there were 3 or 4 times where I took 1.5 to 2 times the amount of clonazepam prescribed to me per day (which is 2 x 0.5mg, as needed) because I was either feeling super anxious in the morning or having full on panic attacks with huge crying spells. 

I am going to be honest with my psychiatrist about the increase in clonazepam those 3 or 4 times during the last 3 weeks, but I also feel defeated and sad about it. I mean, it helped with the anxiety, but then it also just made me sadder (which makes sense as I have too much clonazepam does that to me).

I guess I am just looking for some support and encouragement as I try to get back to a place where, for now, I at most use only the max prescribed per day (2 x 0.5mg as needed) or, ideally, even less. 

Anyway, I would appreciate it if anyone wants to share their experiences with me here.

2021-06-01 07:04:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nprdp5/my_benzo_story_clonazepam/,My benzo story (Clonazepam),"Hi everyone. I had no idea this subreddit existed. I thought I'd share my experience with Clonazepam.

I had my first panic attack when I was about 10/11 years old. Shortly after I went to see my family doctor and was prescribed Paxil. I was also allowed to have a small dose of Clonazepam if I got really anxious. Over the years I've had a few medication changes and eventually ended up taking Clonazepam daily. I don't really remember how I increased.

I ended up overmedicated. I was on 120mg of Cymbalta (the max dose is 60 I guess?) and I was taking 3mg of Clonazepam a day. I had narcolepsy for awhile because the medication made me so sleepy. I should also mention that I did see a psychiatrist for awhile for meds but she wasn't the greatest and also thought I was bipolar (which I am not) and eventually left her practice and patients behind so I had to start getting meds from my primary care doctor. 

Fast forward a couple years and I moved about an hour away from home. I started a couple of new jobs and failed at both of them because I kept breaking down. I decided I should probably talk to someone about my medication. I had an evaluation with a nurse practitioner and she was basically like, ""you're way overmedicated and you need to stop taking these meds, benzos are bad."" I was shocked. I had no idea.  She wrote a whole tapering plan for me to get off Clonazepam but it was too quick of a taper and I couldn't do it that fast.

When I finally got in to see a psychiatrist we started a slower taper. It took me a year to come off of Clonazepam. It was an extremely difficult, LONG process but I did it. I came off of Cymbalta around the same time.

I am currently on 100mg Zoloft and I take 25mg Hydroxyzine capsules for when I'm feeling really anxious. It has been a really long journey but I'm starting to feel better again. I had no idea Clonazepam was so addictive. I would often forget to refill my prescription and go into withdrawal - I thought it was just increased anxiety from forgetting to take it.

If you have any specific questions for me do not hesitate to ask! I will do my best to answer. I apologize if I can't remember something, I think taking Clonazepam for almost 20 years messed with my memory.",41
