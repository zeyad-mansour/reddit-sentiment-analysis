I originally was taking 1-1.5 mg a day for about 2 years. I am now down to a quarter of a pill (so .125 i think). Anyways, I could really use some support, advice, or just to hear that someone else has gone through the same. I think I am over the hump in terms of the worst withdrawals, but I am still having some pretty bad symptoms. The most common: I have terrifying nightmares every night that effect me throughout the day, horrible insomnia (usually do not fall asleep until 6 am), sometimes I will wake up to a panic attack, muscle spasms, random moments of depersonalization (I feel like I am watching from another perspective), fatigue, and really bad stomach issues. 

Anyways, today I woke up to a panic attack and it was horrible. It has been so long since I have had a really bad one and I am pretty sure it is because I cut down my dose. I basically woke up with my heart racing, felt like I couldn't get air, and everything was super hazy. In addition, I have extreme fatigue (like horrific). I can barely stay awake throughout the day. I have been running in the mornings and in the afternoon to wake myself up, but this only lasts for about an hour or two. Then I am back to feeling exhausted. So all of this has made me feel extremely down about my current situation.

On top of it all, I have read so many things about how benzos effect you even years after being off of them. If this is true, I feel like I am suffering for nothing. I might as well stay on klonopin if I am going to keep having symptoms for years and years. I do not know how much longer I can do this for. My family, friends, and boyfriend do not really know the extent of what I have gone through. I pretty much just keep it to myself (unless I am really freaking out and need help).",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.89200854}"

Just like everyone else I started low after revisiting benzos from a year off. Long story short shit got hard and I obviously started them again so my starting dose was 4mg cause I wanted to be barred and careless and I started taking them on and off like would wait 3-5 days between doses that big, eventually, like it always does, I started to take more because I wanted less stress, got up to 12mg but wasn‚Äôt daily but I‚Äôd take at least 4mg on days I didn‚Äôt slam them, and now I‚Äôm somewhere in between feeling 6mg ish like I get forgetfulness and and then I tried pretty much just taking one less a day as a taper until I got to one a day but I relapsed and am back to 8mg due to stress. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about tapering but have been through withdrawals that I didn‚Äôt know were even withdrawals just thought I had something extremely medical going on but now I understand that I cannot just stop taking them without extreme anxiety or worse seizures which luckily haven‚Äôt happened yet. I‚Äôve gotten prescriptions but I pretty much take farmaprams only as my main source of benzo and I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do to get off without having seizures or at least making my withdrawals not as bad as what I‚Äôve been through before. I have like 40 farmaprams left and was wondering if anyone knew how to taper from there. Right now my doses are so scattered 8mg today 6mg yesterday sometimes I‚Äôll take a small amount to take the anxiety away from when I drink. Moral is I want to be done or at least have self control when life gets hard, how do I taper off of a random schedule like that  for about a month and a half to two months. Yes I know I‚Äôm a fucking idiot but stress will beat idiotic tendencies 7 times out of 10 for me.

The longest streach.,"As the title says, today I have 40 days off all benzos. My last being a klonopin and Librium taper followed by gabapentin for about 15 days. I played like hell coming off a nasty Xanax habbit switching to klonopin last spring. That wasn't enough so I discovered RC Benzodiazepines and that went south really fast. Rewind back to when covid-19 really starting hitting us here in the states. I had gotten myself off the pharmaceutical benzos which I had been prescribed for years. Mainly alprazolma. I should have quit when I had the chance to switch from Xanax to klonopin but no. So I decided it be ok to take this bad habbit to a whole another level and started ordering clonazolam and a few months later adding flualprazolam into the mix. Mind you in the past I had gone through plenty of withdrawal and some seizures. This time coming off the Rc's I had landed myself in the ER several times from having serizures so bad at one point I thought I done permanent damage. To this day even though I feel like complete shit everyday mainly from lack of sleep and trying to deal with my problems head on with a chill pill. I'm not ok. But I will not give up and cave in because I didn't just make it to day 40 for nothing. Now I have since developed a nasty gabapentin habit considering that medication is what helped me get through the worst. That one should be a cake walk compared to the benzos. But seriously if you think messing with benzos even if they are prescribed is cool...your wrong. And if you think you hit the jackpot and RC Benzodiazepines are better...you better think again because that will be your lowest and it will come back and bite you in your ass.",10,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.778685}"

   ***Decreased Zinc and Increased Copper in Individuals with Anxiety***  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738454/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738454/)

And before anyone goes rushing off buying zinc and swallowing it willy nilly there's a simple test you can do at home to find out if your definitely zinc deficient  as taking too much zinc can be dangerous. 

If you sense or think possibly that  your zinc levels are  low a simple and inexpensive test can be performed with a zinc assay, a  liquid supplemental zinc that when put in your mouth and held there for  a few minutes tells your levels.

 If the taste is similar to water, you  are low in zinc and should swallow the supplemental liquid. If you have  normal zinc levels the taste will be awful, sharp and bitter, you should  spit out the liquid as your body doesn‚Äôt need the supplemental zinc.  

So I have sent for  *ZINCATEST* \- *Brand: Lamberts*, its cheaper to buy  it directly from their website  if your in in UK but you can get it on Amazon but its a bit more expensive, as well as other Supplement websites and if you are deficient you can also use it as a zinc supplement as well. 

Also read up on how much a day you should take and if you never taken it before take it with food , read up on side effect's etc before taking anything you never taken before and start off low not top doses to test your tolerance so you don't rev up or make any symptoms worse. 

You can then taper it up if you need to so your taking it high enough to be a therapeutic dose, as some of us are going to need more than others, if you prefer to take it in pill form then then get Zinc Picolate as that's the best and easiest to  absorb form of Zinc.

I am from europe, helping my BF to taper klonopin slowly, he's making good progress so far with some relapses here and there. He's been tapering since almost a year, took klonopin for 8 years.  
Now he has been feeling this intense itching/pain in the groin since he started tapering, so around almost one year ago. He has tried lots of things, antihistamines, cortison, etc. Some doctors believe its a bad nerve response.

Now i have researched amitryptiline and it is like another antidepressant that can also help nerve problems. One day he got the prescription, tried it, and he became so fuzzy and dizzy he couldnt think straight and was having a walk in the park and struggled to come home.  


I have been struggling with depression and anxiety and always healed myself with natural stuff. I have never taken a benzo in my life. I think that psychiatrists are big-pharma whores that want to keep clients for life. I am so mad at this doctor that has prescribed him klonopin for 8 years, without ever checking up on him, without ever wondering 'maybe its the time to stop?'. I think he is not a doctor, he is a big pharma representative.

Now his pain and itchiness is so strong that he wants to take amitriptyline, no matter the costs. I am worried as hell, the doctor who prescribed him this didnt even visit him because of lockdowns, he just had a simple chat and the phone and said go for it, he never even met him before. I have read that amitriptyline can cause serious damage if you have liver problems. He didnt even ask him 'how is your liver' and didnt even ask him what other drugs does he take.  


So long story short, i do not trust doctors, at all, from all my personal experiences.

 Ive had this before when I've not taking my street Valium(in uk so only thing I can get currently) but I think I've had it before when maybe hungover or something.

So most recently i tried going 24 hours without any benz to see how i got on.... after around 22 hours my thoughts start racing about something.... And the racing gets faster and faster... to the point they get so chaotic... that it feels like they are just about to reach a drastic point were they get so uncontrollable that something might ""flip"" in my head? So just before my thoughts get so uncontrollable and get to that ""point"", I sit up and distract myself to stop it actually reaching that ""point"". 

I don't know what would happen if I let it reach that pinnacle. Maybe it would just reach it and then subside? But I have a fear that if If I let it reach that point without sitting up to take my mind off it, that it may make me seizure, or go psychotic or something else I dunno so I sit up, or turn over or do something to distract. Does anyone have any insight on this or if I'm just over thinking it and nothing bad will happen?

I remember a time when I was thinking about how large the universe was and how infinitely big it is and I had to stop myself as my mind couldn't conceive the enormity of entire universe without beginning to panic. That's just one example. But there are others that having nothing to with not being able to comprehend things.

Hello - 

I had some major medical issues (post viral neuropathy post Covid infection) in March. It sent me into a world of chaos with my heart and my brain.  

I was prescribed Xanax at .5mg 3x a day to help ease some of the anxiety that came along with it.  

I‚Äôve gotten better over time but I need to kick this final medication to the curb. I definitely developed mild dependency while on it. I‚Äôve already weaned myself down to 1mg per day.  

But I have a question - did any of y‚Äôall deal with severe noise anxiety?  Normal day tones (text tones, cell phone rings, videos playing unexpectedly) literally make me feel a sense of panic in my chest.  

I even feel like I get a little motion sick when scrolling?  

Is this normal?  

I‚Äôm thankful I was on such a mild dose and only since March.  I‚Äôve read so many of your stories and I can‚Äôt believe what some of you have been through but it gave me the final nudge to kick it now rather than later.",5,"{'viral': 1, 'covid': 1, 'infect': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43863225}"

Any advice on length of taper?,"This will be the second time getting off these things for me. I was on klonopin before for only a couple months, and had a few months of protracted hell. This time is a year.... and I am oooo sooo excited to start this spiritual journey into the depths of Hell. It's my own fault.... cannot be mad at anything or one but me.

  
I know I am starting to get interdose withdrawal. Between doses, I start getting a very very strange nuanced feeling that is impossible to describe. Almost like the beginning of some form of disassociation (depersonalization or derealization perhaps?) but not quite full blown.   


It's like my mind feels like it ISN""T mine... like the landscape of it is just so different and uncanny.... again it's almost impossible to describe... I just did't feel right in the head and it's VERY subtle, but also VERY noticeable if that makes any sense whatsoever.  


For example, last night I wanted to watch a horror movie. I started feeling very disturbed... and it wasn't from the movie itself, as I've seen it millions of times and adore it; it was my klonopin dose wearing off and making me feel some really visceral fear (I take the 1mg at bedtime).

I can't watch anything upsetting. Nothing about death, people getting hurt, too much negative emotions etc. And this is totally out of the norm for me. I love horror movies for example. I remember this being a symptom of my previous withdrawal... being HIGHLY sensitive towards morbid topics or concepts of any kind.  


Just getting ready to start tapering.... I have a good supply left- 120 1mg pills 30 .5mg pills.... I'm moving countries in a couple weeks and going to wait to start tapering.   


Anyway, any advice on how fast to taper? Should I really draw it out as long as I can? Or should I make it reasonably quick, like no longer than 2 months or so? I can definitely buy benzodiazpines OTC where I am moving, supply is no issue.

I started with recreational benzos when I was 16. I‚Äôm now 38. The longest I‚Äôve been clean in that time is about 6 months and that‚Äôs been sporadic. I‚Äôve been to rehab 4 times. Been hospitalized after seizures 3 times and suffered through multiple seizures at home alone. I‚Äôve been arrested multiple times. Multiple DUI‚Äôs. Physical scars from falls and broken bones. Wasted an ungodly amount of money. Lost countless friends and multiple relationships and jobs and every opportunity that has come my way. I gambled. I stole. I lied. I cheated. I have basically been a garbage human. 

The fact that all drugs are easily available online made my habits 1000000000000x worse. And the fact that I like to mix benzos with stimulants and alcohol made it worse. And the fact that nothing is ever enough for me made things worse. And the fact that despite all of my terrible, insane, dangerous, life threatening (mine and the lives of other innocent people) decisions I‚Äôve never had to worry. About money. About having a place to live or food to eat. My family has stood by me and loved me and supported me and helped me and never ever ever given up on me. And enabled me. As an addict I use childhood traumas to manipulate their guilt in to me getting what I want. Again...garbage person. 
I don‚Äôt discriminate in what benzos I use and my level of abuse has varied over the years. There have been stretches of time where I was at 100mg of Xanax a day. Yes. That is possible. It‚Äôs hell. But it is absolutely possible. I had some clean time last year in to this year. Then relapsed. I was back to about 8mg a day for a few months then I had a piece of mail that was delayed a few days, I ran out, seized in front of my girlfriend and her two kids, and ended up in the hospital. Again. 
I have spent my entire adult life consumed by shame and guilt. Constantly wondering what embarrassing thing I did that I don‚Äôt remember. What a person that I don‚Äôt remember meeting saw me do. Who might recognize me from whatever bender I‚Äôd been on. I‚Äôve been constantly ashamed and terrified of things that may or may not have happened. I‚Äôm diagnosed bipolar with major depressive and anxiety disorders. I won‚Äôt get in to my mental health issues in depth, but I have NOT been ok and I have never taken care of these things. 

I do not want to be posting this. But I‚Äôm doing things differently this time. I don‚Äôt like therapy and my girlfriend has to push me sometimes to make the appointments but I‚Äôm doing it. I don‚Äôt want to feel things. I don‚Äôt want to cry so much. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm crawling out of my skin. I don‚Äôt want to feel like everyone is talking about me. I don‚Äôt want to hate myself. I don‚Äôt want the laundry list of things I‚Äôm feeling. BUT, I AM feeling them. I have to do these things I do not want to do to have the life I want. I want a life with the woman who has stuck with me through the shit I‚Äôve put her through. She has encouraged me, cried with me and for me, supported me, pushed me, and despite the sadness and anger and gamut of things I‚Äôve made her feel, she‚Äôs still with me wanting a future. I want to be someone my niece looks up to. I want to be successful in my life. I want to use my degree. I‚Äôm tired of being tired. Living in this addiction is exhausting. 

I‚Äôm 106 days away from the last time I used drugs. Being clean is hard. It kind of sucks. But it‚Äôs getting better. I have to figure out who I am at 38. It‚Äôs terrifying if I‚Äôm being honest. It‚Äôs overwhelming. But I‚Äôm doing it today. And I plan on doing it again tomorrow. I might delete this, but for now I‚Äôll post it. And truly truly truly, if I can do it, anyone can.

I've been unable to get out for the last two months, I cut 15 days ago after a 4 month hold did noting but although I felt it was doing nothing, and I was getting worse  my brain was getting some healing time in during the hold. 

Anyway I decided shit to it!! and cut  .5mg (1/2 an mg) after getting more and more awful during the hold and very depressed about it

I've been up and down since the cut between feeling no better or worse than before the cut bad but bearable to feeling fkn dreadful  but had 2 really severe  bad days since the cut, and yesterday was the worse one yet.

 I honestly felt I wasn't going to make it through yesterday,  and today I feel rough but felt the urge to try  and decided to push myself and at least try to  go for a short walk or as far as I could manage  before I had to turn back and I made 5 whole minute when I didn't think I would get to the end of my path!! 

And even if I had only gotten as far as the end of the path and back that would still be a big achievement!!  It hasn't got to be massive to be a success, every tiny positive is a step in the right direction.

And want the same for everyone of you struggling along side me on this journey whoever and where ever you are, how you got here is of no consequence  we're all in it together  .ü§ó

 

No matter who gives up on you like everyone in my life did, all because I became so ill on Benzos and trying to get off them,  never give up on yourself  keep going, your all you need to get through this no one can do it for you, be brave, its hard to  find your inner courage  and keep  going though this hell until you get to the other side . 

&#x200B;

You will have many days you won't believe its ever going to get better, or your damaged , your brain is fkd, ( I know I doüòä  )  but that all normal to feel and think like that in withdrawal/healing and its not true either EVERYONE going through a hard time getting off this shit don't believe their ever  going to heal.

I've seen thousands over the year's who thought the same and every single one of them is now living a wonderful happy healthy  life they never believed they ever would for so long like all of us will eventually.

So I've been addicted to xanax since i was 17, using on and off. I could never maintain a normal dose, like prescribed from a doctor. Off the bat I would usually pop 3 bars at once, and continue to eat them like candy until I ran out of money, got kicked out of my parents house, fired, etc. Then I'd get sober for a short period, just to do it again later. 
When I was 19 I was taking atleast 10 bars a day (20mg xanax daily). Which would make anyone act stupid obviously and i would constantly ruin my reputation, lose jobs, friends, girlfriends, etc. 
Usually I would go to a detox center, where they would ""taper"" you for 3-7 days. Very rough(been to detox 9 times now). Anyways being so young usually I'd bounce back pretty fast, and start to feel okay after a couple weeks.
Now I'm 21 years old, alot has happened, like periods of homelessness due to my addiction, I've been arrested twice, the consequences have gotten pretty dire..
Recently I went on pretty short 2 week run with benzos again. I took over 150 xans in that 2 weeks, I'm not sure what that equates to daily. Ended up passing out in a drive thru on my motorcycle, I think I had heat stroke or something, but I couldn't stand up, and I could barely see. Ambulance took me to hospital for some xrays since I kept falling over. 
From there I went to a detox center for 6 days. They put me on 10mg valium 3x a day. (Which is like .5 of xanax). 
At detox my piss was red/brown colored with chunks of something in there as well, which scared the shit out of me. I thought my kidneys were done lol.

Even though I was only using for 2 weeks prior, I've had the worst withdrawals since. It's been 3 weeks that I've been clean now, and i've lost 30 lbs in weight in 3 weeks. It's been very hard to eat and my stomach feels bloated etc, have been super depressed as well. These symptoms are just now starting to go away, thank god.

I just wanted to share how badly I got beat down by drugs. I've been in and out of 12 step recovery the past 5 years. Mainly because my decisions would destroy my life if I didn't get help.
 But after nearly dying the past few times I've relapsed, I have started to reach out for help, within 12 step programs, doctors, therapists, etc. I truly don't want to die from this. 

I feel blessed that I havent been a long term user, and I'm still young. Still have a chance to rebuild my life. I just hope that I can maintain long term sobriety. I'd like to be sober for the rest of my life. Because I know I've used up my chances, avoiding death so closely. I don't know if this means anything at all but I just feel like I've been blessed to still be here and maybe someone might relate to this somehow.

So long story short, I‚Äôve dabbled in benzos here and there. But about 3 months ago in my life something happened and I went crazy taking them (Xanax), no more pharma, at this point presses because I ran out of pharma plugs. I tried to reduce my dose to 8mg a day, but that was too much so I‚Äôm back to the 10mg. 

Problem is I have horrible crying spells in between my doses- like when the dose starts to wear off. I also suffer from depression and anxiety but this has made both worse over time. It‚Äôs like I need to take more Xanax to stop the horrible crying and thoughts of dying- but once it wears off- the hysterical crying starts again. My tolerance is building and I need to take more and more to stop the crying.

Edit:
Just for info, I‚Äôm on an antidepressant and gabapentin, which is helping a little bit with anxiety and withdrawals I think. I also smoke weed. I‚Äôve had adderall binges on some weekends but I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs making the anxiety and withdrawal worse, so I‚Äôm gonna quit that.

I'm a little over six months clean from the shit (after taking a notionally therapeutic dose every day for two years and having to quit cold turkey). The withdrawal was, as you might expect, totally nightmarish. I spent more days in the hospital than I can remember, and had a few stretches where I wasn't sure that I was going to make it -- but happily enough, I am now pretty darn close to 100%, and perhaps feeling better than I did before any of this stuff ever entered my system.

In the brave new permanent pandemic world, I've found myself looking back -- not with any great nostalgia -- on the two to four months that I spent going through proper full-on withdrawal, and I'm still a bit puzzled as to some of the symptoms I experienced, and wondering whether any of them might be common to most people undergoing acute benzodiazepine withdrawal.

1. The inability to walk or to type

For a solid couple of weeks  -- immediately after I got sober -- I was extremely shaky on my feet, such that I couldn't reliably make it across the room. I couldn't risk going outside, because the terrain would've flipped me on my ass for sure. I also lost the ability to type: I could think reasonably clearly, and could speak fluently (in fact, for a stretch, my singing voice grew unusually soulful), but I couldn't seem to string together sentences or even basic words on the keyboard, not without a great deal of concentration. (I can typically type a little over 100 WPM, so this was especially bizarre to me; fortunately, I got those skills back.)

2. Hypersensitivity

My stomach area grew so sensitive that *any* contact at all -- the slightest of touches; my cat rubbing against me; bumping into things -- was acutely painful. The sensation was so intense that I couldn't bear it, which became an issue in the hospital, where it became necessary for the doctors to jab something into me every once in a while. 

3. Time dilation

In addition to the standard extreme anxiety of withdrawal (and perhaps because of it), the individual moments of my life stretched out like hours, months, perhaps years. I remember veering between states of mind over the course of a few seconds that felt like an eternity -- feeling reasonably normal for a second or two, and then totally horrified and convinced I was about to die for another second or two, and then reasonably normal, and then back to horrorshow mode, and on and on. Over time, these cycles seemed to balloon out -- twenty minutes of horror, twenty minutes of relative normalcy -- until they became days, then weeks, and now (barring a regression into some horrific months-long panic attack) I am just kind of in permanent normal mode. When I was deep in the throes of this psychic spin cycle, I had to listen to the same fucking ten-minute stretch of an old, familiar podcast (that I'd already listened to fifty-odd times) because anything new or unusual or noisy or dark would have terrified me beyond description. 

4. Psychedelic-ish states

This is perhaps related to the sensation of time dilation I described above, but there were stretches amid the unending horror and torment where I felt like I was on acid or mushrooms. Ordinary things struck me as indescribably beautiful, and I saw (as one does on a good dose of psilocybin) the perfection in every little mote of matter I could see. This lasted perhaps for a day or two, and was immediately followed by a few months of unmitigated terror, but it was a pretty agreeable state -- a bit manic; perhaps the result of my brain repairing some crucial component of itself, only for that component to realize that it was supposed to be panicking, and so panic we did.

&#x200B;

Other bizarre things happened to me, but these are the four that come to mind at the moment. It was a bit like *Gulliver's Travels* or *The Odyssey,* only I was lying there in bed for much of it and the strange landscapes I encountered were all located on the inside of my skull. Lest any of this sound fun, it wasn't -- not even the psychedelic bits -- and I'm so fucking glad to be done with this shit. Pardon my French.

Cheers!

Fucking assholes i should have made sure they would do a proper taper before going but i was in a dark place, spending $150 every 3 days on bars and shit. All my money went to it.

I became this person my friends didn‚Äôt like, my family worried about, i was self absorbed and absolutely dramatized every single thing. Had benzo rage and made stupid life altering decisions.
Made me lose my scholarship and ultimately have to drop out of my first year at university.

So the thing is i can clearly reflect on how bad that was for me and all the shit i fucked up on, i can recognize that. I recognize it almost killed me from withdrawals. I had to be sent to a psych ward from the detox center and then from the psych ward to the ICU for 2 days in a fucking medically induced detox. Then 4 days in the hospital recovering before going back to rehab. Tubes were in me everywhere.. Even down there  too... 

it‚Äôs crazy though, my mental state was so far gone and i was put on a bunch of crazy meds in that psych ward that i was so oblivious to what was going on i was in my own world. I hallucinated my phone in my hand when i closed my eyes. Every night i would dream some crazy illegal shit happened and i had superpowers that let me teleport back to the psych ward. I was communicating to people from different places through the detox room wall. I could go so far deep into what i remember it was like a story. Anyways...

These things fucked me up! 

Yet almost every damn day damn near a few times a day i get some pretty intense cravings and for some reason even after all that hell i endured my brain tells me to keep seeking it out? I‚Äôve relapsed three or 4 times since getting out of rehab in April.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do, because i think of benzos all the fucking time and honesty would be getting them if i could, but i wanna stop at the same time.

I realize once I start cutting doses (currently at the equivalence of 15mg of valium) I am going to feel withdrawal symptoms. Would you say that it's not going to be nearly as bad as like a detox where they completely rip you off a high dose of benzos when I get as low as I need to go? I'm just overthinking this taper, the cuts have not been bad at all so far so I'm wondering when I'm going to experience, or if, I'm going to experience hell once I jump to 0.

I previously got ripped off of 200+mg of valium (clonazolam and diclazepam at the same time) a day and took phenobarbital for 2 weeks before they said I was medically stable and it was hell on earth. This was about a year and a half ago. I don't want to repeat that and I am responsible with the taper now. Once you have been through it before you know not to fuck up, and I fucked up getting back on them for work pains/anxiety about the future of my career.

Backstory (was using a low dose of pyrazolam (weak benzo) for roughly 4 months. It's a research chemical that really only clears anxiety and isn't like a clonazolam which gives you the false impression of being sober. I never slurred my speech/stumbled and still haven't to this day. I think I will be okay once I taper down low enough. I feel normal and nobody has said that I am acting different like the first time I was on them.

Fortunately the physical symptoms is better now, not gone by any means but managable.

However, for the last three months I had severly increased anxiety, insomnia and depression. Intrusive negative thoughts that feels like someone is constantly pressing me in the gut and chest 24\\7, it's damn nightmare. I'm not sure if this is related to withdrawal or I'm just seeing my life gone to shit. Dealing with the symptoms I was in survival mode for years and didn't think about much else. I thought I would be so happy once the pain was better, but reality dawned upon me brutally. I'm now a middle aged dude with no property, relationship, kids or career. In addition to the mental issues I still have to deal with I think will take years to resolve, if ever. Funny how trivial those things seemed to me when I was simply striving to get through the day, now they are casuing me existensial angst like hell.

Does that feeling of happiness/relaxation will get back from 5mg if i stop taking them? I just want to feel happy from time to time. I guess now i should stick to alcohol.

I was prescribed xanax about a year ago. I've had a history of panic attacks, albeit they come infrequently so I hardly ever took it. That is until 10 days ago. I drank a decent amount on a Friday. I dont drink too often but when I do I guess I over indulge. Social anxiety and all.

Anyway the next morning woke up with horrible anxiety attack. Took .5 xanax at noon. Symptoms persisted so ended up taking another .75 that night. Next day I felt very shaky and on edge but never took any xanax. But Monday am woke up with one of the worst anxiety attacks I've ever had. Since then I've had non stop attacks at all hours of the day pretty much. However now I feel like withdrawel is causing this. I was able to switch to valium last Friday night.. The attacks are different. Immense sadness and being scared has fill me up. I find hard to say though after just 10 days and relatively small doses thag I'm addicted/dependent on it. Im feeling worse and worse. I constantly feel like I'm going to die. last night I stayed up the entire night pacing in the same spot for 12 hours straight. At the same time I'm afraid to take any more meds than I am. Here is what I've done after 10 days.

10/10 Noon .5 xanax 10pm .75 xanax

10/11 Nothing

- bad - had seizures ... started slow taper...

I did the slow switch in Ashton to slowly move to Valium. I‚Äôm now down to - 9mg of Valium. (** EDIT: I am having my pills given to me - I am down to 5 mg) wow üò≥

*** QUESTIONS:

- very blurry vision

Allergies, itchiness, needing constant Benadryl

Temperature higher

Strong headaches

Flashing lights

Sleeping a lot

I‚Äôm just curious if anyone had this kind of thing go up at the very end of switching over from something else on to Valium or just tapering off Valium just anecdotally. 

I‚Äôm also aware of the - again -Monty Python style humor ‚Äî  that is a lot of those symptoms could be something else entirely.

&#x200B;

  

No problem! I wish you the best of luck! And those experiences are definitely the exception. I think the majority of people just experience heightened anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia, as well as some physical symptoms. Try not to read too much into other people's experiences. That was the worst for me. I would read something bad about benzo withdrawal, and then wait for whatever it was to happen to me. That definitely raised my anxiety, and probably made me experience some psychosomatic symptoms. I made the decision to stop reading other people's stories and just experience whatever was going to happen, and that made me feel so much better.

I am so glad to hear you haven't had symptoms other than insomnia! Remember that while the benzo withdrawal horror stories are true, only a percentage of people get them.

It is not uncommon for people to actually feel better as they lower their doses. I didn't realize how many issues benzos were causing me until after I tapered off. Good luck, and I hope you are able to stay off benzos! Just remember, that even though you were able to get off this time without many issues, this may not always be the case. If you start using benzos again, even at a low dose, it is still possible in the future to get hit with severe withdrawals. I am so glad you were able to avoid them! Thanks for the update!

I worked full-time getting off benzos, and I did not have psychosis or hallucinations. I've been on for nearly two years, and I tapered off 25% at a time about 3 weeks at each dose.

I ran a starting business I tapered down from 3-4mil to 1.75 to 2. Then just completely dropped it. It's not recommended. But the tapering was ok.. I didn't have problems working. When I went CT I did it on a Friday. Friday night was bad thru Monday. I worked from home barley doing anything Tuesday and Wednesday but then after that my mind was slowly healing. 2 weeks with weird feelings for me. I did it for about 7 months. If you are going on taper you'll be fine. It's just a little uncomfortable for 2-3 days then you'll adjust. But if you later go CT you may want to plan a couple days off. It's over 60 days for me. And I feel fine. I seem to have a little memory problems. But that's about it. And through the past 60 days I grew my business into a profit. So if I can start a business and stop... anyone can quit.

I was addicted to benzos for 12 years. Tapered off in treatment on a two week librium taper (with medical supervision NEEDED). But I had zero hallucinations or delirium. I did feel physically ill, anxious, sick, cold, hot, miserable. BUT ITS TEMPORARY

I've finally ended my decade plus affair with benzodiazepine. It's day 75 of a cold turkey jump from multiple milligrams of Klonopin I can't be happier than where I'm at now. I am now having zero to very little WD symptoms. I barely even want to call them waves as they barely last and they're very weak. My muscles being sore and weak are like the only things left. But I'm so glad I didn't prolong healing and taper. I feel like in hindsight it would of prolonged suffering. I'm not sure but what I did was right for me. We are all different. I also took some medicine for seizures when I did jump. Anyways, don't doom yourself. There's no guarantee you're going to be suffering for ages. WD definitely sucked. It was not close to easy. My symptoms were super bad so I wasn't getting off barely touched like some luckily do. I'm just saying for anyone new to recovery or considering jumping, give your body time. Try and see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just wait for your emotions and feelings to return and know life will be better off benzos.

You‚Äôre so right!

I‚Äôm on day 29 tomorrow was on Klonopin daily for 5 years.. I have pretty much zero symptoms now!

Day 14 -19ish was the worst for sure.

Stay strong everyone! Some people may have extended withdrawals but I think it may be a possibility that a lot of people just have higher states of panic and daily anxiety that they are calling ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù

So glad to see you on the other side! I jumped on June 15th but I also jumped from a ton of psych meds and pain meds as well. Keep up the good work! Only thing that isn‚Äôt Normal is sleep for me, but I do a lot of meditation so it does not bother me one bit. We are so conditioned to believing we need ‚ÄúX‚Äù amount of sleep when in actuality, our bodies tell us what we need, so long as we are not medicated

**Fuck benzos been sober for more than 2 years now**

üì∑

Just want to tell u guys it‚Äôs always possible no matter what ! I was fucked up and I made it out my life is great and I don‚Äôt feel like I need to depend on a stupid pill to live my life how I want ! I hope you guys reach your goals pills or not and always have positive vibes.

TL;DR - \*\*\*From years of 1 mg Xanax per day and 1 month of 5mg Xanax per day to ZERO after a careful taper. If I could tell anyone anything, it would be - you can do this. You will have setbacks, you will feel weak, and you will suffer but it‚Äôs worth it! Your brain and body \*will \*heal. Your neurotransmitters and GABA receptors will work again. Be patient and kind to yourself and cut slowly. Drink water, exercise when you are able to, meditate or do yoga, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take magnesium and melatonin for natural relaxation. The sources I relied on the most were The Ashton Manual, Kelly Brogan, and a supportive doctor. Good luck üçÄ and Be well ‚ú®

About 10 years ago, I started taking .5mg of Xanax to manage anxiety when flying. Next I started taking it to manage hangovers. Then I realized it amplified my buzz when I took it while drinking. And before I knew it, I started carrying it with me all the time ‚Äúin case of emergencies‚Äù. \*Its a slippery slope.

When my husband got a terminal diagnosis 3 years ago, I started taking .5mg-1mg every night to sleep and .5mg per day if we had a bad one. I knew I had crossed the line into abuse, but I just let myself take it to manage.

When my husband passed away last May, I foolishly quit my job a few months later to ‚Äúget healthy‚Äù. My plan was to get off all antidepressants and benzodiazepines , but I fell into a deep depression for a month while grieving and started taking as much as 5mg Xanax daily and trying to sleep my pain away. I was able to taper from 5mg Xanax to 1mg in a few months because I had only abused the 5mg for about 1 month, but it was hell. By January of this year, I finally got help from a doctor who converted my 1mg Xanax dosage to Valium and helped me follow the Ashton Manual to quit completely. I finally did it - I‚Äôve been benzodiazepines free for 3 days!!

There were times I cut way too fast and many times I was so anxious, I felt like I might die. Normal fuctioning became a memory as I couldn‚Äôt even go grocery shopping or walk my dogs. I missed trips with friends and family and I missed entire days/weeks to muscle aches, crying, anxiety and a sense of hopelessness. Today, I‚Äôm 3 days benzo free (I know it‚Äôs not long, but it took a long time to get here and I‚Äôm never going back). I feel amazing!!

If I could tell anyone anything, it would be - you can do this. You will have setbacks, you will feel weak and you will suffer but it‚Äôs worth it! Your brain and body \*will \*heal. Your neurotransmitters and GABA receptors will work again. Be patient and kind to yourself and cut slowly.

to everyone about to or currently withdrawing from benzo‚Äôs‚Äî IT GETS BETTER! DON‚ÄôT GIVE UP

i abused xanax since 2015 and i am 4 months clean. i quit cold turkey after taking \~ 4 bars a day (8mg) in my home. my withdraw felt a little like: uncontrollable shaking, sweating, nauseous, puking, bones felt like the were breaking, couldn‚Äôt sleep, heart palpitations, minor seizing, crying‚Äî the worst i have ever felt. it was almost like i was in a dream (bad dream), my vision was blurry and i couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. kind of like tripping on acid where you feel like you‚Äôre in a video game sort of thing, but instead you‚Äôre in pain all over your body and could puke any moment and can‚Äôt see.

a week into withdraw i found a half bar on my floor. i sat and stared at it for a good 30 minutes. ‚Äúif i take it the pain will stop, do i do it? should i take it? i‚Äôll just stop tomorrow.‚Äù my demons were getting the best of me. I FLUSHED THAT BITCH.

i can‚Äôt put into words how amazing i feel today. i couldn‚Äôt be more thankful each and every day that i pushed myself through the pain and agony that i endured and that i am finally free of the cloud of addiction that consumed my whole world. that pill had control over me until i chose to be stronger. YOU CAN DO THIS. IT GETS BETTER.

It's still going on and it's quite distressing, but it's getting better. This is what I found helpful:

¬∑ Quitting drugs and alcohol. Reducing or quitting caffeine intake.

¬∑ Meditation.

¬∑ Being outdoors. Go for a walk or a run daily. Do some gardening if you have a place to do it.

¬∑ Psychotherapy. If you can't afford it, talk to someone you trust

¬∑ Cleaning up my diet

¬∑ Sleeping more

¬∑ Avoiding distressing news, movies, TV shows (this was a big one for me)

¬∑ Pets. Nothing better than having a cat curl up next to you

¬∑ This might not apply to other people - doing focused mental work. Doing research, programming, writing articles (I work in academia). However, this only started helping me once I learned to ground myself after working.

¬∑ Hey everyone, I had severe DPDR starting at December 5th and it stopped around January 12th. I had it because it was drug induced but I got it weirdly after thinking about the time I had a panic attack from marijuana. And I couldn‚Äôt stand having episodes of being cut off from reality and myself.

¬∑ First and foremost the most important thing to do is to not fear it or stress about it, live life like nothing has happened. When you have the episodes of DPDR don‚Äôt stress and keep thinking about it, simply say to yourself that it makes you uncomfortable but it can stay as long as it wants. This distances you from the fear, once you embrace it then it becomes less of a problem.

¬∑ Secondly, you have to know that DPDR lives off fear and stress. Once you remove the fear and stress then you eliminate the DPDR, but it‚Äôs a big step to quit fearing it. When you obsess about it and worry about the next time that it will come, then that‚Äôs what triggers it.

¬∑ In my personal experience I‚Äôve learned that if I don‚Äôt think and obsess about it then the DPDR fades away. But that is just my subjective experience, everyone has different circumstances and brain chemistry.

¬∑ The first step I want you to take is to completely stop researching it and to get rid of anything that involves it. Stop watching YouTube videos on DPDR, quit looking at forums about DPDR, quit looking at Reddit posts about DPDR, I want this to be the last post to look at involving this disorder. Completely cut off anything that involves it.

¬∑ The main reason people can‚Äôt rid themselves of DPDR is because everyday they‚Äôre looking at posts, videos, and forums about it. When you do that all you do is create more fear and stress and then the DPDR kicks in because your brain realizes that you‚Äôre giving it the fear and stress that it needs to thrive therefore leaving you in a loop of DPDR and all other side effects.

¬∑ Mammals have the ability to become depersonalized, it‚Äôs a way the brain allows us to die because we disassociate from everything and it makes death less painful. What do you think a deer does when its depersonalized? It doesn‚Äôt obsess about it and it lives it‚Äôs life normally because it doesn‚Äôt obsess over the thought of it. However humans on the other hand, we can have the power to think and rationalize everything, so when DPDR comes around our brain freaks out, other mammals have a primitive mind and they rid themselves of the DPDR because they don‚Äôt rationalize it. Do the same and you‚Äôll feel better.

¬∑ Another important aspect of recovery is to have hope although it feels like there is none. THERE IS HOPE, you just feel like there will never be, when you have days where you don‚Äôt feel the DPDR it‚Äôs because your brain is healing, that‚Äôs what gave me hope and I kept that hope in times where everything felt pointless. Wake up everyday and if you have good days think nothing of it, when you have bad days think nothing of it. When a depersonalization thought comes into your mind like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel real‚Äù, simply acknowledge the thought and don‚Äôt think more about it. Bring your thoughts and attention to something else and move on. When you obsess over the thought of not feeling real then that‚Äôs what triggers the depersonalization.

¬∑ PSA- don‚Äôt buy the online courses of people saying that they can give you techniques to get rid of it, in my personal experience I didn‚Äôt have to change my diet, exercise, or meditate. All I did was not obsess over it nor fear or stress over it. We can obsess about anything, I could walk down the street and obsess on the thought that I could be ran over and killed but I don‚Äôt. Be like any other mammal, live life, accept the feeling of DPDR, don‚Äôt fear it and that‚Äôs how I recovered completely back to normal. Best wishes.

¬∑ I never thought this was possible. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to feel any other way besides anxious, fearful, and constantly dreading being alive.

¬∑ 13 days post a 6 month taper and here we are.

¬∑ You guys, I feel like I‚Äôm 15 again. Filled with energy that I forgot existed. But the road was hard, this wasn‚Äôt an easy thing to do. I had loads of support from family and wife, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. Doing this alone would have been so god damn hard and for those that are riding this Hell Rd. Right now alone, keep Rollin. You got this

¬∑ I was prescribed Xanax for these dizzy spells I‚Äôd get from getting super anxious at a high anxiety job. And I‚Äôm pretty sure I have inner ear issues.

¬∑ Well, my Brian got used to Xanax, Xanax was no longer working so I asked for Klonopin. THE WONDER DRUG! It really works so well but at a cost. Our whole fucking world revolves around it now.

¬∑ This last year of taking Klonopin my symptoms started to get worse. It was no longer magic everyday and I was feeling anxious if I didn‚Äôt have one in my pocket, in the car, in my wallet. It controlled every part of me. After multiple panic attacks while ON the drug.

¬∑ It was time to stop this shit

¬∑ Long story short.. I started a taper in Feb. I decided to cold turkey and lasted 9 days before Satan swallowed me and threw me up and shat on my soul.. I re instated at .5 Klonopin.

¬∑ I was better, but I was still in a living hell. Fast forward to sleepless nights, that constant feeling of having to be in motion (I forget what this is called) having zero patients for doing things like picking up my kid, being in a store, doing any kind of ‚Äúerrand‚Äù threw me into a panic. Feeling of my heart exploding through my chest, thinking I had an aneurysm constantly, thinking I had throat cancer, you name it. I believed I had it.

¬∑ I switched to Valium for easy taper. So glad I did.

¬∑ I felt more clean about the taper. I was no longer cutting Klonopin and eyeballing my pills cuts. I knew exactly how much I was taking.

¬∑ Taper is where all my symptoms went crazy. Everything I explained above I had up until I jumped off.

¬∑ 2 days after jump off at 1mg Valium I had these intense headaches for 2-3 days. But that was it.

¬∑ I took a nice long taper (for me) and have experienced nothing but some mild anxiety post jump off and I‚Äôm feeling so good!

¬∑ I think a lot of us read the horror stories here and expect to feel the same. I was waiting for say 9 to be my hell again but NOPE. I am not everyone and not everyone will experience what you experience so pleas please please, have your own experience. Don‚Äôt let the fear tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to suck on this day and this week‚Äù because it may not. And if it does? Cool, keep riding this shit storm out. Everything works out and I never ever ever believed I‚Äôd be here writing my success story of finally jumping. But here we are.

¬∑ I did it. I beat this bullshit disease of swallowing mg happiness and as corny as it sounds.... if I can do it, so can you

¬∑ I was hopeless. Ready to die. Even though I fear it the most. I was ready to accept that this is my new reality.

¬∑ Fear, dread, constant panic, it‚Äôs all subsided.

¬∑ I feel happy. Natural being a kid type happy.

¬∑ Keep fighting guys. There‚Äôs no right way to taper, there‚Äôs no book on what your experience is going to be like. Just keep fighting, don‚Äôt get discouraged, and you‚Äôll come out on top. Have a great weekend everybody

¬∑ Sorry if this was long and there‚Äôs a lot of spelling mistakes. I wrote this all on my phone

# 31 days WOW

üì∑

Never thought I‚Äôd say that I haven‚Äôt taken a benzo in 31 days

But here we are!

Was on 1mg of klonopin a day for 5 years. .5mg Xanax the year before.

Long story short, it‚Äôs been 31 days, and I feel pretty damn great. Beside this new fear of driving on the interstate or far from my house everything day to day is going better than I imagined

One thing at a time though.

Day 14-19or so was rough but I pulled through. And the panic is very minimal now. GIVE YOURSELF TIME GUYS

Also, don‚Äôt believe all the horror stories on here. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Have your own experience, it‚Äôs fine to relate but don‚Äôt turn someone else‚Äôs reality into your and think you‚Äôll never get better

You will get better We will get better üëäüèΩ

Quit reading. Figure out your game plan, then stick to it.

I'm not necessarily even looking for advice, I just need to vent.

I've had pretty hardcore anxiety since I was a teenager. There was a year of my life where I had a full blown panic attack almost every day. My parents, who both have Xanax prescriptions, spent years suggesting that I see my doctor and get a prescription because they felt bad that I was suffering. For years I refused, not wanting to be chemically dependent. Eventually in my early 20s I followed their advice, realizing that my life was completely unmanageable. For the first time in as long as I could remember, I lived without constant panic attacks.

I've never in my life found anything that comes close to the feeling of Xanax. I actually don't take it recreationally. I follow the dosing guidelines as carefully as I can. I've never had more than .5mg in a day, and never taken it for more than 3 days in a week. There have been years I didn't take it at all. I've never experienced withdrawals or had a craving for it. My philosophy has always been that I'm not willing to source it from the street, and I need to have it available in moments of genuine crisis, so as long as I don't build a tolerance, the low doses I'm prescribed will still pack a punch (which they do).

I'm venting because it's SO. FRUSTRATING. that this miracle drug exists, yet it's so addictive and dangerous. I experience anxiety every day of my life, ranging somewhere from ever-present discomfort to debilitating pain. I'm not this way because I abused a substance and damaged my neurotransmitters. I'm this way because of the brain chemistry I was born with and the traumatic experiences I've lived through. I was this way before I ever even held a Xanax in my hand. It's scary and frustrating to hear stories about how your brain is permanently altered by prolonged use of benzos. Every time I read that, I end up thinking ""I was born with that post-benzo-addiction brain, and the only thing that actually soothes it is Xanax."" It feels so unfair. I've tried a whole bunch of different SSRIs, supplements, meditation, therapy... the last two have helped some, the medications not at all, and ultimately nothing comes close to the power of a benzo. It doesn't give me a high, it doesn't make me feel drunk or spacey or anything except... normal. As soon as it kicks in it's ""Ah, how nice. This is how people without anxiety must feel every day."" It doesn't feel like I'm taking a drug, it feels like something I'm supposed to have in my brain that my brain has never learned to make on its own.

I know tolerance builds, even though I've never experienced it. I know that anxiety during/after withdrawing from it is reportedly much worse than the anxiety that caused you to take it in the first place. But I can't help feeling like if I could just take my regular dose of .25mg every single day, my anxiety would be cured. I'm frustrated that there isn't something available out there that works as well without the addictive properties and inevitable withdrawal. Why can't we develop something that teaches your brain to regulate its own GABA, rather than just throwing more GABA at it (which feels great in the short term) until it's completely out of balance and forgets how to make it? How is there not a drug for that? I eat pretty well, exercise regularly, drink very little, take a probiotic and multivitamin. Why can't my brain do this one thing? Why isn't there a pill for that?",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7085861}"

All in all I've been on benzos most of my 20's and at 31, I just want to know myself soberly again.

As a brief history, I started getting prescribed Diazepam roughly 5 years ago for agoraphobia and panic attacks. My anxiety used to be truly unmanageable, but through the medication I was able to gain some form of security and normalcy over time. I was initially prescribed 10 mg a day, and I'm currently only on 1mg a day. I certainly don't ever feel ""high"" on it, as I'm quite tolerant at this point, but if I don't take it everyday, I start to get generally achy and feel unwell. When the pandemic first hit, I tried to go off of them and made it about 2 weeks before I was experiencing what felt like mania and major trouble retaining information. The symptoms got really pronounced and I was even having difficulty with basic reading comprehension/playing piano and I'm an experienced pianist, so it was incredibly disheartening. So, of course, I went back on my very small dose for the sake of stability.

But my biggest motivation for going off is so that I can finally have children, as from what I've heard Valium/Diazepam does cause birth defects. Honestly, I don't know if this is 100% true, and am curious if 1mg would affect pregnancy, but I'm assuming so. It's just incredibly discouraging because I really did feel like I gained some sense of normalcy (I was able to maintain a job on it for years, unable to hold steady employment previously), but I also have struggled with feeling a bit numb emotionally over the years, which has also affected my musical and personal life.

Is there anyone on here who has tapered successfully from Diazepam, and if so, what was the best method for you getting off of them? Thanks in advance for any advice.",10,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66058666}"

So, in 2009 i had a bad 10-15 bar a day habit.  I ended up trying to commit suicide (not bc of withdrawals, i was boosting from stores to keep my habit of that & #4 heroin up.  The suicide was actually due to losing a fiance to heroin on her 2nd use.  So, my suicide attempt kept me in a coma for 2 months.  Apparently i kicked benzos during my coma.  When i came out of the coma i vowed to never get a benzo habit again.  I kept my vow until roughly a year ago.  A year ago i became homeless.  Like sleeping outside and eating at community resource places.  During the time between coming out the coma & homelessness i sold bars.  I bought quantities between 1k-5k every 2 weeks or so.  To make sure they were legit id eat 6-15 and black out but wouldn't touch again till next order arrived.  Now, a year ago when i became homeless i befriended one of my old custies.  She had been homeless and was addicted to alcohol & dependent on prescribed benzos.  At first i would binge my 90 bars in a few days.  And a week or so later id convince her to binge some of her 120 bars.  Well, eventually she convinced me that taking bars as prescribed made life on the streets much more tolerable.  Took away the shame while panhandling, made sleeping at night much easier bc b4 everytime i heard someone walk by i would wake up. Eating a bar at night b4 bed made it more comfortable & allowed me to sleep good.  So for probably 6 months i ate 2 bars a day.  Sometimes i would sell to many and get stuck buying bars off the streets for $5 a piece.  So, then i started messing with RC's.  Eventually i settled on taking 1mg am, & 1mg pm (im pretty sure although they are advertised as 1mg they are really between .5mg-.6mg.  Ive been taking those for roughly 3-4months.  The one thing xanax does that Clonazolam doesn't do is give me a big appetite.  So, if my gf cooked a good meal or if i saw someone at my methadone clinic id give them a bar.  So, yesterday was supposed to be my appointment.   At 8pm they told me my dr was no longer practicing there and they offered me to come in & to give me a list of. Dr's .  Pretty much all the doctors they recommended Drs that mostly specialized in detoxing off benzos.  They also gave me the names of a feew places that detox you completely off using phenobarbital.   In my local county jail they switch you to equivalent dose of Kolonopin and every 2 weeks they bring you down .5mg.  This works good but when you go from .5mg to nothing its very uncomfortable.  So, my supplies for detox if i cant find a dr that i can show ive been on same meds for years by showing pharmacy printouts, the supplies i have stocked up are approximately 49-45 (.5-.6mg but listed as 1mg) Clonazolam pills.  About 80--85pharmacy xanax, about 80 2mg-2.5mg pressed Xanax and 45 1mg kolonopin and 50/1mg Kolonopin every month until im no longer benzoo dependent .  Do i have enough to safely tapeer. If so, can you give me some taper plans.  Esp, what substances to start with?  I do have a pill splitter and the Clonazolam are splitable..  In addition if anyone is good at seeking out dr's thaf dont treat benzos like Fentanyl im open to advice.  I really dont want to taper but i feel it may be only option to avoid horrible withdrawals (i seizure and have auditory hallucinations, and loud ringing in my ears like they are connected to an amplifier!)

Ps- i have no income but family and friends have agreed ro pay for dr if he/she will def prescribe meds i was taking....",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.53317523}"

‚ÄúThere is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their effectiveness after a few months. In fact, because of tolerance, long-term benzodiazepine use may even exacerbate anxiety disorders, or worse, create newer, worse ones while on the drug or suffering from withdrawal.

Many patients find that anxiety symptoms gradually increase over the years despite continuous benzodiazepine use; panic attacks and agoraphobia may appear for the first time. Some long-term benzodiazepine patients report severe, worsening anxiety. 

Some individuals prescribed a benzodiazepine for a physical condition with no previous clinically significant anxiety develop new severe anxiety during tolerance withdrawal for the first time. 

Interdose withdrawal may also be a sign that tolerance to benzodiazepines is developing. However, for some patients, tolerance may also be absent or partial, and some chronic users still report some continued efficacy of the drugs.‚Äù",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7424666}"

so it starts out with me being a wild 15 year old. where i'm from, drugs are like a hobby to people, and being an artist i was exploring them like crazy, especially when i was younger. but benzos didn't seem as evil as they do now. the homies and i would get together and we always smoked weed at that age, but we had managed to get our hands on xanax. at that point, none of us were addicted. we would just fuck around and get swashbuckled every blue moon and record ourselves doing quite literally the goofiest shit. for them, thankfully, it never ended up becoming an addiction, they grew out of it. but something a bit different happened to me,
i believe it was what i would call a coping mechanism, for my anxiety, and for the life i had at home. a large family, that is constantly angry with each other, and very cutthroat in the things they do and say to each other on a daily basis. it felt like it never ended.
i would stay awake and make my music through the night because that's the only time you wouldn't hear them screaming in the background of my recordings. 
i don't know how it happened, but i started to take xanax at home, what i thought personally at the time was that it made being at that house a lot more bearable. i had just turned 17 at this time.
over the year of me being 17, it was a downwards rollercoaster into addiction. 
i went from only having to take one or two bars when i was 15, to having to take 5 or 6 to feel anything desirable. this only got worse, plus i'd gotten into the web, at the time i only knew about etizolam though.
at 18 i was in the same cycle, but getting worse. now it was 8-10 bars a day. i would be broke and would choose to buy xanax over food any day. 
at 19 i caught an OWI. i went from taking 10 bars a day to drug testing clean twice a week, cold turkey. had some withdrawals, but no seizures. thank god. 
this all crashed down about 6 months later, when i stupidly started doing research, and found out etizolam wouldnt make me pop dirty on the lab test. started really fucking my life up with my supportive girlfriend, on etiz, as well as with my family. then i got into clonazolam.
i don't know what the fuck i was thinking, but over the course of a month it destroyed my life and one morning, after my girlfriend told me she was going to break up with me, i decided it was time to seriously change.
i went to rehab for a short amount of time.
i didn't leave because i wanted to use again, but because i realized i had a LOT of shit i needed to work on in life. especially since i got kicked out of that abusiv household i was in. clonazolam got me some violations, and trying to sneak taking xanax on the weeks i finished testing got me some as well. 5 dirty tests in total. i got a good lawyer and plan on enrolling in outpatient treatment so i can continue to work. time is of essence especially if i don't want to end up homeless. 

being kicked out of my house really made me realize how bad of a trigger that environment was. even talking to them, which i don't anymore, ever. in rehab they had to stop my moms ability to talk to me, because she is a brick wall, and a snowball of anxiety. 

anyways, thank you guys for reading. i want nothing to do with benzos anymore. the thought of what they did to me disgusts me.
the thing i am most thankful for is that i never had any seizures. i literally couldnt be more thankful.

we can all beat this shit. these foul chemicals. i believe in us. and i have hope for all of us.
much love.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45455965}"

I'm wanting to post again to document my experience in the hopes it helps someone. I was prescribed anywhere from 2-4mg of Klonopin per day from my doctor for the last 10 years. I had been on 4mg for the overwhelming majority of this time. I had actually told me doctor to start prescribing 4 .5 pills compared to 4 1mg around 2 years ago. That was a big mistake! I should also add I was taking extra benzo off the street this whole time. Needless to say, my body was very dependent on Klonopin and I had quite the tolerance.
Edit: I went the CT route. I first started in a detox center but when I was discharged lets just say the worst of WD hadn't started yet. 

Anyways, here we are at day 90 and I'm feeling awesome. I've felt really great here the last couple weeks. Symptoms are virtually gone. Anxiety has finally leveled out. I feel really close to healed. And my withdrawal was not easy or fun. It was awful. Easily the worst experience of my life. Benzo WD really is on a vast spectrum Ive come to notice. 

Here is my main point. Do not doom yourself. It's possible it's not nearly as bad as you'll expect and it's possible it doesn't last as long as others will tell you.  It's possible it's worst than you thought but that doesn't mean it will last 6 months or years. Time really is your greatest friend here.",24,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41002598}"

I will keep it short. I started self-medicating with clonazolam (around 400ug daily) about two months ago, mainly due to sleeping issues. After one month of daily usage I decided that the knock-out effects and drowsiness the next morning was too much, so I switched to etizolam.  


The Etiz didn't knock me out quite that hard, but were still very effective. I used around 4mg of Etizolam for the past month daily (sidenote: I do react stronger to clonazolam than to etizolam, therefore the switch was already a dosage reduction for me).  


Today I got my norflurazepam (diclazepam wasn't available) and I am going to start my taper. My questions:  


* Recommended dosage? (I thought about smth. like 10-15mg depending on reaction)
* Recommended reduction rate? (5mg reduction every week or so?)
* Daily dosing or every other day?

I was in a college and I was totally fine without medications or anything... until I started to feel I have insomnia and can't sleep and also developed anxious because I was worried I might not get to sleep the next day...

After this I did my second mistake which also stopped this medication hoping everything will pass fine so after 5 days developed WDs I was really in painful situation so I just did a little research on google and found this subreddit and I am really thankfully I found this and how benzos are so awful to take... after this I decided to call my Psychiatrist and told him what really happened to me... he was so anger at me of why I didn't call him again to followup and slowly taper this medicine.

Now he prescribed me Escitalopram 10mg together with Clonazepam 1mg to slowly taper. So here my question is it fine to taper with this method or I should suggest him the Ashtom manual? I am really wants to quit this awful medicine

 It started with half a bar (1mg?) and as time has progressed that dosage has increased to a whole bar and sometimes a half too on particularly bad days. I self medicate and am naturally high strung as a person in general.. My work keeps me stressed. 

 I now realize after reading some of this sub that I need to stop sooner than later or I'm gonna have major problems. 

 I'm thinking taper now or be damned for a while if I let this continue. I wasn't really aware of the psychological effects it has on the brain. (Which is dumb because I've been an addict my whole life and have taken all kinds of pills but not these) I work 7 days a week and I can't be seizing at work.

2020-10-11 13:15:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/j99agt/the_four_phases_of_recovery/,The four phases of recovery üôåüèª,"*Do you recognize yourself in any of the four phases?*

PHASE ONE

This is what we commonly refer to as the Acute Phase, which commences once you jump off the medication.   

If you tapered and went through tolerance withdrawal, this phase is likely to be a smoother transition than a cold turkey or rapid withdrawal.  

PHASE TWO

This phase is a little easier than Phase One, but is marked by symptoms ""morphing"" in nature, becoming intermittent, decreasing in intensity and frequency, and even disappearing altogether. New symptoms may even pop in and out periodically. Some people start detecting the Windows and Waves pattern beginning.  

Others may start seeing relief in the late afternoon and evening. In this phase, you can pretty easily identify your ""core"" bugger symptoms versus the auxiliary ones, kind of like a circle within a circle of your close ""friends"" versus your ""acquaintances.""  Even if you experience windows, the waves crash down on you for no apparent reason too. It's still a very hellish phase, to say the least, but it IS progress.

PHASE THREE

This phase is better than One and Two because it is more situational and predictable. It is the Sensitivity Phase.  

You might never have noticed you reacted to things earlier in withdrawal, mostly because you were dealing with horrific symptoms all the time and didn't make the sensitivity connection. How could you? You were suffering ALL THE TIME. 

Now that you are further along in your healing and notice a definite dampening down of symptoms, you'll recognize a big difference when you get upticks and flare ups. 

For some people, their sensitivity reaction will come the following day in the form of a wave and they will pull out of it in a matter of hours. This delayed wave reaction and short duration is evidence that your system has healed a LOT. Others might get hit with a wave that lasts a few days or weeks. It probably depends on what caused the sensitivity reaction. 

*Here are just a few things that may or may not cause a sensitivity wave:*

1. You eat something that doesn't agree with you, or contains preservatives or too much sugar.
2. Caffeine, alcohol, weed.
3. Missing meals which makes your blood sugar drop.
4. Too much strenuous exercise, activity or over-stimulation.
5. Stressful life circumstances.
6. Antibiotics.
7. Drugs and supplements.
8. Chemicals in cleaning and personal products.

These are just a few of the sensitivity triggers that may or may not cause a wave. I'm sure the folks on this forum could name many others and I HOPE THEY DO, so the rest of us can keep our antennas up.  

Bottom line: These are situational upticks and waves that are not random and come out of nowhere. You are further along in the healing process. You'll bounce back and keep moving forward, avoiding the things that trigger your waves.

PHASE FOUR

This is the Recovery Phase. Almost all of the debilitating symptoms that kept you dysfunctional are gone. The remaining one or two symptoms are more annoyances than anything. 

Your systems are still healing, so you need to walk gently into re-entry. You also need to keep living the healthy lifestyle you've acquired throughout your withdrawal journey. 

You will feel better and better each day because your systems are continually healing. You will KNOW your suffering is over, but you need to keep your antennas up and abstain from your previous vices for another year.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.510954}"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

What happens in your body with benzo‚Äôs:

GABAergic system (GABA receptors) is an inhibitory system, counteracting the Glutamate system (Glutamate receptors), which is excitatory.

GABA and Glutamate regulate action potential traffic.

GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, stops action potentials. (Rest and Digest).

Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, starts action potentials or keeps them going. (Fight or Flight).

Since GABA is inhibitory and Glutamate is excitatory, both neurotransmitters work together to control many processes, including the brain‚Äôs overall level of excitation.

Under normal conditions these two system are in balance leaning this way or that based on external forces i.e. a bear attack (excitatory system takes over, adrenaline floods the system, muscles tighten, vision and hearing are heightened, mind races, anger takes over etc.) or i.e. bedding down for the night (Inhibitory system takes over, muscle tension decreases, cortisol levels drop, adrenaline levels drop, body prepares for digestion, sex and sleep).

Benzodiazepines (as well as alcohol) attach to the GABA-A receptor site of the GABA receptors located on the dendrites of the cell neuron, imitating the natural GABA, signaling to allow a higher than normal flow of Negatively charged chloride Ions to pass though the GABA receptor gate depolarizing the neuron, super-activating the inhibitory system and overly suppressing the Excitatory system.

Benzos also force natural GABA to bind tighter and longer to the cell dendrites signaling thru the GABA-A receptor site to also allow more Negatively charged chloride ions to pass through.

Result = Very relaxed.

As a result the body up-regulates the Glutamate receptors (Excitatory system) and releases more Glutamate, which then attaches to the Glutamate receptors allowing more Positively charged Sodium and Potassium Ions through counteracting the Negatively changed Chloride Ions and bringing back the overall balance.

If the body has more of a Negative charge it's relaxed, if more of a Positive charge it's more alert.

Where this all goes wrong is when the body and brain, due to being flooded with too many negatively charged Chloride Ions, start to eliminate a minor yet significant percentage of the GABA receptors on each cell trying to hinder the Chloride ion flow.

When this action fails to work the body and brain take further steps of producing new GABA receptors without the GABA-A Benzo/alcohol/GABA attachment site.

All is well and good until such time as the newly produced GABA receptors now lacking the GABA-A attachment site outnumber the older receptors which still have it.

When this happens those prescribed benzos start to experience interdose withdrawal (Anxiety and Panic while still taking the medication).

Doctors will try to solve this issue by prescribing a higher dose, however, very quickly the body responds by producing more GABA receptors without the GABA-A attachment site, plus will continue to absorb older GABA receptors.

Soon, tolerance of the med hits. The meds poops out.

While the early days of the above disaster are unfolding the Limbic system of the brain, thyroid, pituitary gland, etc. which are directly attached to the GABAergic system start to misfire and odd states of reality, emotion, fear, anxiety, paranoia, memory, balance, aggression states, sexual arousal etc. become more and more pronounced. Moreso once tapering begins and worse still once off the meds.

Here are the parts of the Limbic system which start to misfire:

Amygdala: The Aggression/Emotional Center.  Responsible for detecting fear and preparing for emergency events. Fight or flight. Stimulated, it produces feeling of anger, violence, fear, anxiety. Damaged, or medicated, can result in a very mellow state of being, hyperorality, hyper sexuality, disinhibited behavior - ignoring social conventions and engaging in dangerous, reckless behavior. Responsible for fear conditioning, the ""associative learning process"" where we learn to fear some thing, some place, someone, and/or a social circumstance.

Hippocampus: Memory and spatial navigation. Forming new and storing memories. Coverts short term memory to long term memory. Responsible for emotional reactions to past memories and events.

Thalamus: Regulates the body's voluntary motor control, consciousness and its sleep/wake cycle. It also regulates the senses of sight, sound, taste, touch and the sense of where the person's body is in space.

Hypothalamus: Produces hormones which control the production of hormones in the pituitary gland. Hypothalamus function is directly related to overall hormone health.

Fight or Flight/Rest and Digest plus body temperature regulation. Responsible for the release of adrenaline via the autonomic nervous system. Hunger, thirst, sleep, sex. The hypothalamus sends danger signals to other parts of the brain and puts them on high alert, preparing to fight or flee. It also tells the pituitary, adrenal and thyroid glands to secrete more hormones to prepare the body for action.

Cingulate Gyrus: Processing emotions and behavior regulation. It also helps to regulate autonomic motor function. Emotional Memory. Regulates pain and emotion. Is particularly involved in driving the body's conscious response to unpleasant experiences, therefore the avoidance of negative consequences.

The end result of this, in part, is the Excitatory Glutamate system is no longer being kept in check by the GABAergic system so it's running wild.

This causes overblown and confused states of mind (anxiety, panic, confusion, memory, depression, phobias, etc.), body malfunctions (thyroid, putuitary, tachycardia, automonic nervous system, etc.) and pain becomes the norm (neuropathy, lower back, etc).

To add insult to injury now the patient has to come off the meds, the only substance slowing down the  Excitatory system and giving it even more freedom.  Unfortunately glutamatergic receptors are not homeostatic like GABA receptors, changes to glutamatergic receptors stick around.

Since GABAergic medications or substances no longer work to offset the now raging Excitatory system all one can do is endure it (survive) until such time as new GABA receptors are being created with the GABA-A receptor site.

This is what happens during the healing process (Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome) and is entirely dictated by the level of damage done by the medications and the genetics of the individual which allow how fast the body and brain grow new GABA receptors with the GABA-A attachment site restoring the broken and off balance systems.

In the meantime, any substances, or states of mind (Stress), which irritates, or boosts the Excitatory Glutamate system must be avoided.

Items such as sugar, MSG, caffeine, any GABAergic agent (alcohol, St. John's Wort, Camomile, 5HTP, KAVA, Z-drugs [Ambien], Phenibut, etc.) and everyday chemicals and foods become landmines as each can cause horrific increases in withdrawal symptoms for the individual, again based on genetics and sensitivities, and since GABA is directly responsible for muscle tone and mass we also experience a wasting, withering physical state.

We lose muscle mass, gain (or massively lose) weight and have an immune system which is barely there all while the body and brain are malfunctioning on a level never imagined possible.

Your GABA-A receptor forest has been burned down by benzo use. This forest must regrow and it takes a long time once GABA agonist use has stopped.

During this time, no GABA agonists can be used, most especially alcohol. Alcohol is like liquid benzos, and benzos are like freeze dried alcohol ‚Äî they are cousins. One cannot replace one with the other or healing will never happen and GABA-A receptor sites will have no reason to regrow.

Also, the two highest concentrations of GABA-A receptors are the stomach/gut and brain which is why those in recovery have so many issues with food, digestion, etc and mental health issues. There are approx 100 Trillion GABA-A receptor sites on the Human Body. One for nearly every cell. Every system is impacted. Every. System.

*P.S. For ease of understanding, it only takes one day to burn down a 100 year old forest, but a long time to grow it back.*",81,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6272731}"

I appreciate all the feedback, no matter how hard the truth me be. 



Anyways, here it is: 

I've been tapering down from 10+mgs/day of xannax for over a year  now (have been taking them since I was in highschoo, but had 2 solid years on just Libriuml.) I have never stated the full extent of my problems, because I honestly felt stupid and ashamed. Im over that now, but its still rough to even admit it to myself much less anyone else. 

Now, ive tapered down to 1mg/day klonopin with probably 5 days max in the last 4 months where I surpassed that, despite symptoms of my RLS, and severe depression and just overall pain coming back en force. 

Now, im COLD TURKEY 3 days in and i lost it this morning. My loved ones want so badly to help me, but they can't understand that for me, just focusing on getting to 1mg per day was nearly impossible.  So showing signs of actual change other than that has been incredibly difficult....and now my loved ones are loosing patience.

Can every one here please try to help me explain why it has been so difficult for a full year?  10mgs or more per day of xannax. .. Down to 1mg klonopin per day now down to 0. Anxiety is absolutely screwed rn and I cant hardly breathe, see or eat...i simply can not explain this to them right now without sounding like a selfish prick.
I need to explain WHY I get so self absorbed.  Why I isolate. Why I fantasize via social media because im so lonely, and so afraid to make friends.  I need to explain that I mean so much good,  but im literally STUCK in one spot. I cant move half the time. I need to explain why I cant work  right now....ugh.. you all get the points haha. 

All responses would be so so appreciated!

Sorry if this is a mess lol ugh. 

Also sorry if im late to respond.  Its incredibly difficult for me to form cohesive thoughts right now. 

Thanks again friends. Were all capable of over coming this. I will not stop hoping for happiness unaided by benzos and unabated by anxiety.  Stay strong!!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64580643}"

I‚Äôve been on and off Valium ever since a GP gave me a box of 50 x 5mg tablets in Feb 2019 and despite the warnings I continued to take it daily because of the relief it gave me. I‚Äôve been on 6 different SSRI‚Äôs, Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, don‚Äôt get me started on that. 2 voluntary rehab admissions where I tried the 12 step NA approach which just didn‚Äôt work for me because it was like a Judeo-Christian process of black and white ONE IS TOO MANY A THOUSAND NEVER ENOUGH meaning each elapse resulted in ‚Äúfuck it who cares I‚Äôve relapsed I can do whatever I want for now until I go back‚Äù. I got out of rehab last year and my psychiatrist gave me a box of 50 which started the process all over again. This year at my worst I was taking 4mg Alpraz + 10mg Diaz a day OR 4mg Clonazepam and 10 diazepam OR up to 6mg Ativan/Lorazepam a day and 10mg diazepam, this was back 6 months ago. I successfully tapered down to 2.5mg of diazepam in the morning over 4 months and the next day I didn‚Äôt have any. 9pm that night I had my first seizure. It scared the shit out of me and my partner who caught me and stopped me from hitting my head, apparently I ran away from him screaming because I didn‚Äôt recognise him then I just remember waking up in an ambulance. So I got loaded up with 60mg diazepam in hospital and immediately ordered a bunch more diazepam online because with my weekly pickups of 5mg I was not surviving I‚Äôd literally wake up crying and screaming unable to sit still just walking around in circles pulling my hair out with thoughtsof suicide. I‚Äôm technically on 5mg Valium daily with the taper but keep ordering more online and when shit gets stressful I pop a few more and.. it‚Äôs a vicious cycle. It got to the point of going to ER multiple times out of fear of seizure and they would give me about 10mg of diazepam then discharge me knowing I had none left but with the reasoning that ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt seize off diazepam and it‚Äôs rarely lethal‚Äô. 

This past week I‚Äôve had days where I‚Äôve only had 10mg of diaz or equivalent in clonazepam a day but today for example I was freaking out about some shit so I‚Äôve popped a few extras and I certainly don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm tapering. I know about the Ashton manual but in my country the government guidelines are brutal recommending a 4 week withdrawal and rapid rapid reduction. I‚Äôm beginning to lose hope. 

Anyone else have the same problem? You know how bad it is and what this shit is doing to your brain but you basically don‚Äôt care because you‚Äôd rather dose up than literally feel like your brain is on fire? 

Getting a kitchen safe is useless I‚Äôd crack it open in a day or two. 

I‚Äôll always have access to benzos online if I want them.

I'm here to say that there's hope. If I could do it, I'm sure you can do it too. However, I don't necessarily recommend a quick taper, I suppose i was lucky.

little bit of background: i abused benzos recreationally starting late 90s, had an opiate habit and when quitting in 2010 was prescribed 8mg of xanax daily, quit in 2016 CT and it was HELL, total disassociation, lots of stuff i cant even explain well w words. i felt so so horrid during it i went to a psych 4 months in and was told i had ""con-genitive heart failure""... i dont, but stress was so intense my organs were strained. i ended up going back on Klonopin in late 2017 (after taking 16 months off benzos and never ""getting back to normal""); was prescribed 6mg daily but unless things were really raw i only took 1mg at most, usually .5. i have rather severe PTSD and tbh getting back on benzos allowed me to sleep finally, and i spent a few months sleeping a good 22 hours daily. as i started coming out of that and feeling better all around, i started thinking and realized ive honestly never even liked benzos and while they have helped when i needed it, they started just making me kinda stupid and out of control (not extreme but the two hours after id take one in the AM i would say shit i didnt mean etc). a few months before Covid i got a weird ass lung issue... i never get sick, and i couldnt even walk upstairs for 48 hours, even the thought of eating food made me shiver and tremble. im 37 and i bugged, decided after i wouldnt ever let myself feel so weak. i started to taper in Jan, got down to .5 by early March and .25 by May. i hung out at .25 til late July, switched to .125 and started feeling kinda horrid. started adding a .125 in the evening also for a few days, and once i felt ok but still kinda crappy for a few days by brain told me to just stop. this was early augsut.

i had bought a good amount of Rick Simpson Oil at a dispensary specifically to come off benzos, and fuck i am surprised at how much it masked not just mental issues but physical issues from PAWS as well. i was very lucky and i didnt have an actual ""withdrawal"", i felt sick for a few days then felt close to nothing for 3 weeks. then something hit me, but it was so under the radar i didnt care that much, i just knew i didnt feel ""normal"". i decided to switch to a high CBD:THC ratio oil (2.5:!) and wow. its been 9 weeks and now im 4 days without taking RSO (i still have a ton to take for fun) and im surprised, ive been kinda cold sweating and dealing with minor stomach issues for days: i realize theyve been there the whole time but i just didnt care due to the THC oil. RSO contains a lot of ""phytocannibinoids"" so its a real ""medicated"" and ""full spectrum"" feeling. this shit really helped tho, i didnt throw up once, didnt have one seizure/panic attack, have been able to eat 3 meals a day and sleep 5-8 hours nightly.

I need some help planning my taper. I reached 0.50mg of V 14 days ago and I feel like the peak of the effect of the cut has passed. Things are very manageable IF I administrate my routine well as well as respect my own time. I say this because generally during the weekends I can almost be normal lol generally without any need to get a long pause as I need during the week. The thing is: I work with IT and I need some focus for programming and I also need to do well in work meetings. The second one is the hard part if the day is rushy and too much meetings were scheduled: if I think 'too much' for like 2 hours I feel like I am overheating and I NEED to take a pause not thinking/meditating/relaxing or generally if I ignore this feeling and keep working I will have some nasty and scary symptoms that seems like serious shit.

That being said, I have 22 more days until my 30 day vacation and I am wondering if I should use this situation to jump off Valium.

I am considering cutting to .25mg for maybe 2 weeks and jumping off V. I am actually over the fence about some stuff regarding this. Some people say that there are no benefits of tapering when under .50mg and that you are only prolonging the suffering, some people recommend tapering to fumes for a more gentle jump, some report an awful time even with the fumes strategy.

I don't know if there is a better time to try this as I want to be off this med asap to start recovery and maybe try some supplements I have without interaction from the med.

Point is that when I am not working, it's unnusual to have tough symptoms and I am thinking that 30 days not needing to work might be a good opportunity to chill and manage something that it would be hard to if working.

It's also important for me to be stable after the vacation as I will be involved in some projects that will be important to my career, but it might happen in my own time as my manager do know about my benzo situation and I have some support regarding doing stuff in my time.

I also kept the 'big guns' to use after the jump: I have Magnesium (Glycinate) and L-theanine + Inositol that I didn't took and the bottles are still closed. I also have CBD oil.

He‚Äôs in his 2nd year or residency, and now prescribes all the medication for his patients. 

Some background on me: I was prescribed Klonopin for 8 years. I self-tapered for 9 months, and I dealt with horrible latent withdrawal symptoms for a solid year. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without the advice and support from this sub. 

I was asking him about his job and how he deals with patient dependency/tapers of controlled substances. He said that in the cancer ward, you don‚Äôt withhold controlled substances (makes sense). If a patient is eventually well enough to come off opiates, tapers can take anywhere from 2 months - 1+ years, depending on the case. He warns his patients about withdrawal before they start the medication, and helps them with advice of how to taper and what to expect. 

I was encouraged to hear how he supports his patients through the process. I shared my own experience of tapering off klonopin and how difficult it was to have no support from a doctor. 

He then asked me how long it takes to get dependent on benzos. For a round of radiation treatment you, you typically have to go 5x a week for one month. Radiation treatment causes most patients a lot of anxiety. During radiation treatment, he prescribes his patients  0.5mg of Ativan (lorazepam) once a day for 30 days. 

He asked me if I think he should be warning his patients of withdrawal from benzos or if he should be tapering them after (like maybe a week or two of 0.25mg Ativan). He specifically prescribes Ativan because it is a short acting benzo, thus less likely to cause dependence over such a short time period. 

I shared what I know from the Ashton manual. I said that perhaps a diazepam taper could be beneficial, though he was concerned about the patient becoming more dependent bc it is a long acting benzo. 

I realized most people on here are not medical experts and this advice is not equivalent to medical advice, but it seems like the medical community teaches jack shit about benzo withdrawal and dependency. 

With all this in mind, here are my questions: 

1. Is 30 days on 0.5 Ativan long enough and a strong enough dose to make a taper advisable? 

2. If so, what taper (with in reason) would you recommend? I don‚Äôt want to give him some super complicated taper recommendation. However, if there is something simple he could follow, I believe he would be open to trying it. 

3. Has anyone been on low dose Ativan (or comparable amount of another benzo) for 30 days and if so, to what extent did you experience withdrawal after stopping? 

In the Ashton manual, there is a suggested taper schedule for coming off 3mg lorazepam. This is much stronger than what he is prescribing his patients, so I imagine such a lengthy taper would not be necessary for his patients.

Quick back story, I was prescribed 1mg Xanax PRN as a naive 18 year old who wasn‚Äôt aware of the long term effects of taking benzos daily. Klonopin was added on probably a year or so later. Again, PRN, but was changed to 1mg daily around age 21. I recently turned 26, so I‚Äôve been taking Klonopin daily for at least 5 years. At the time I was just so desperate to stop feeling anxious, so I went along with my psychiatrist who told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the type of person who would get addicted‚Äù when I brought up concerns after doing some research. 

Lots of other issues came up along the way, including an attempted overdose with my benzos at 22 and my psychiatrist continuing to prescribe them despite this. Yikes. 

Anywho, I have had a new prescriber, an NPP, for over 2 years now. I had stopped taking xanax except for the occasional panic attack and it has been our goal to taper me off of the klonopin, but it took about a year until I was ready to start. It has been a very slow process, and now I am down to .25mg daily. Next month I will go down to .125mg and then by December I am due to be off of benzos completely. 

There have been many times along the way I was terrified to cut down any further due to fear of rebound anxiety. The klonopin wasn‚Äôt even helping because I had gained a tolerance for it, but I became so mentally dependent upon it. I had to learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. That it‚Äôs okay to experience anxiety. How to manage the anxiety without the need for benzos, etc. 

It has taken a long time to get to a place where I will soon be benzo free. If someone out there is in a similar situation, I hope you take from this that it is ok to need to take your time. Do it at your own pace, tell your doctor when you need to keep the same dosage until youre ready to go down again. Be honest with yourself and whoever is helping you taper (if that is the case).

Little background, I‚Äôve been on xanax and RC benzos for the last 8 years of my life (I‚Äôm 25). Last year I checked myself into an impatient rehab for 30 days, started hitting 12 step meetings daily, got a sponsor, worked the steps, etc. I was clean for about 7 months, but still felt mentally foggy, super anxious and just generally not myself.  

Last April after quarantine had been going in for about a month, I stupidly started looking at subreddits that glorify benzos, and from there it was over. I made a conscious decision to order RC benzos yet again. At first I thought I had control over it, because it started out to be only on the weekends, but that inevitably led to daily use, multiple times a day. I also started experimenting with RC painkillers, which I never had an issue with before this. I used to be a raging alcoholic and have always abused benzos, but I haven‚Äôt drank in a little over a year.

To be honest I do not know how much I was talking per day at my worst. But it was mostly etizolam and pyrazolam. And at the end I was dosing unknown amounts every few hours, because they were solutions that I did not make or test.

All this to say, I finally came clean to my family, girlfriend, sponsor, and checked into an outpatient program about 2 years ago. But for some reason I still can‚Äôt stop using, even though I lose everything (relationships, job, etc) if I continue. 

I guess I just wanted to rant. But any advice/support is greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm just done having to rely upon a substance for daily life. 

Love everyone in this sub. Stay strong and try to have a good weekend.

I'm nervous about this much. I also breastfeed and don't want my baby to be negatively affected.   


Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I came here because a friend of mine recommended this page after hearing what my doc had told me and being skeptical. I know it's long, I just don't know what details are important so want to make sure I give everything for accurate advice :(  


Backstory/Context: So I'm 28, hadn't sought treatment for mental illness until talk therapy 2-3 year ago when I was not interested in trying medication. Found out she diagnosed me with generalized anxiety (never talked about a diagnosis just looked at my chart through my gyno later). Stopped going after 3 months. Over the last 6 years or so (i've had two kids) I've developed a lot of anxiety, but have only had a handful of panic attacks. I'll usually get really angry or frustrated but be able to recognize them coming on. Aside from that, I go about my day being very irritable and just kind of miserable all the time? Very unmotivated, no focus......  


The focus thing is what really got me to be like ""okay i have to see someone"", that combined with finally in my late 20's trying smoking (weed) and edibles (mellowed me out so much I was like okay yeah there's a benefit to substances, I see that.) I have several friends with ADHD that have told me i show a lot of symptoms of it, have taken all the online evals and it's like YUP ADHD. My friend tells me she realized her anxiety was actually a symptom of ADHD - once she started taking ADHD meds her anxiety went away.

  
So i finally decide to go to a psychiatrist. the appointment was weird, quick, over the phone with an over-anxious nurse, and he prescribes me .25mg up to 2x a day. This is what he SAYS anyway.... he explains i only need to take it as needed, see if it helps. Says my focus issues are because i have so much anxiety (I told him I've only had a handful of panic attacks, but do feel consistently anxious and like I can't finish things, can't start tasks because it stresses me out, just give up after coming home from work because i feel like there's always too much to do, can't stay on task at work at ALL -I mean i'm typing this up at work....). I pick up this prescription after the pharmacy has to call them back because it's illegible, and I see it says .25 3x a day. I call the pharmacist because I'm also concerned about breastfeeding and the fact that the Psych did NOT explain to me to take this way... he says to take it as needed, you shouldn't start off with that much especially cuz you've never taken it before. Okay.   


I do this for 3-4 weeks. Take one in the morning at work, sometimes 2 on a weekend if I feel like I'll be easily stressed that morning. I don't really notice a difference except when I take 2 and already feel myself getting worked up. And it just kind of makes me give less of a shit instead of calm me down so tasks don't seem daunting. So, I make an appointment to talk about it and really address evaluating me for ADHD.   


I get a new nurse, who's super cool and listens to me - doc basically tells me I'm not doing it right, I should be taking it as prescribed so it's consistently in my system (even though that's NOT what he told me in our first meeting) and finally to start to take .25mg 3x a day, then after 5 days if i don't notice a focus difference then come back and he'll DOUBLE by dosage to .5mg 3x a day then we can see if that works... and I'm just like, can't you please test me for ADHD first?? I'm not trying to get addicted to this stuff and that seems like a lot. This appt is over the phone too, so the nurse is like, look I hear what you're saying and I know you're nervous, do the .25 3x a day and call me monday, if it doesn't help i'll set you up with another psych to do a ADHD evaluation. He's basically saying ADHD meds have much worse side effects and Xanax has a bad rep but it's not that bad.   


I'm not SUPER concerned about taking .25 3x a day till monday but i AM concerned about taking .5 3x a day. Cuz I mean, even if that DOES work.... what is that doing to my body? that seems like a lot.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6452199}"

In the folly of youth of my early 20s, I gobbled benzos haaaard, at one point I had a 2mg xanax rx (30 pills /mo) and a 2mg klonpin rx (also 30 pills/mo). needless to say I went haaaaam. Now I am in my late 20s and only take klonopin extreme emergencies like once every 2 to 3 months. Due to my heroic consumption I now have non-trivial memory issues which have resutled in me being.....dumber :/

Stop Sleeping Well and You'll Pay,"I'm just now realizing how a good night's sleep is critical when you taper. UBER critical! I had to updose klonopin recently due to some ""hit you square in the face"" life issues. The last thing I wanted to do but I'm not as young as I used to be. Couldn't gather the strength to maintain.

So, after a week or two on 0.5mg I started back down. Easy, cause it was never a problem before. Now I'm at 0.39 and I feel like pounded shit. 

What's changed that I feel so bad? No sleep! It's like I forgot how. I mean like overnight I went from 8 hours a night to 3. So the vicious cycle begins. No sleep equals more anxiety. More anxiety equals less sleep.

So, what to do? Hold and stabilize. As long as necessary to get my sleep schedule back on track. If you think holding is just delaying the process and adding more of the drug to your system, well, that's true. But a hold is a temporary thing. 

Sleep is a key part of the tapering regimen. In fact, it may be the MOST important part of tapering. I don't give a damn what Benzo you're on or how much you take or how much you cut.

Sleep is more important than anything to keep you strong enough to finish and get clean. Lose it, and you'll pay. Especially if you don't have youth on your side anymore. At least I did get 8 hours last night. Gonna try for 10 tonight.

I've used Lormetazepam 2mg to sleep before, but was off them for several years. 3 or 4 years ago, I started using them again now and then. It became more and more, sometimes taking them with alcohol and at one point I started abusing them and taking them during the day. It became taking 2 at once. I was struggling with alcohol, codeine and benzo, I tried to control the alcohol, but that made the codeine and benzo abuse worse.

Around Christmas I had enough and decided to quit drinking. This made the abuse of the other two worse and at the end of January I realised I had to quit this shit, so I did. And didn't sleep for 5 days and was brought into the ER with a psychosis/mania. Was a month in the mental ward and guess what they gave me to sleep? Hello Lormetazepam 2mg...

When I got out, I was severely depressed and it's not hard to guess what happened? Old habits die hard. I was juggling doctors and pharmacies, but my GP finally cut me off of the codeine and I had to call my psych. Told him everything, that I took 8 Lormetazepams at one point and if we weren't dealing with corona, he would have submitted me right then and there. We started tapering, the codeine got tapered a bit and then cut off, the benzo took a while. We started with 3 Lormetazepams and 3 Tranxenes (clorazepate, can't remember the dose). Then 2-3, 1-3, 3, 2, 1, 0. Didn't really experience anxiety or withdrawals except for the normal kind of stuff I'm used to deal with.

Meanwhile I decided to drink socially again, that went off track and ended in the hospital and by a coincidence, the last Tranxene was on the same day of my last drink. And some new insights and meds have entered my life and they seem to have changed my life for the better.
