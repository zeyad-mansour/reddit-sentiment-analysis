Wondering about CBD for anxiety.,"Im still not quite myself after a year and 1/2 of 2mg/day kpins. When i quit i jumped right to 0. It's been hell but its also slowly gotten better. Im still going thru a ton of anxiety but i can leave my room and interact with people around the house just fine. To the question at hand. I have a bunch of 30mg CBD ~.3% thc softgels from CBDISTILLARY. Ive taken them before and it's been a mixed bag of 4/10 anxiety and nothing else really noticeable. Im wondering if taking them despite this may help the recovery process. Any input is very welcome at this point.

I suffered a massive panic attack last week that sent me to the emergency room. My BP flared up into the 190s and wouldn't go down for a while. My doctor prescribed Clonazepam .5mg. This is the lowest dose, for two months. I am supposed to take it two times daily but am afraid of getting addicted to this. I don't want to be on these long term. 

They do help a lot with anxiety and I feel normal for the most part so my generalized anxiety disorder has dissipated considerably. I just wonder about dosing. Sometimes I take them too late in the morning, and then I have to take them later at night, and then wake up in the morning to go to work, but only about ten hours max has passed between each dosing. Is this enough time? I know the pills can work for up to 15 hours so am I overdosing? 

Should I cut them in half and only take the full dose at night to get the right sleep, and take .25 during the day? I seem to need it more at night to sleep and it helps a lot. I wake up refreshed and less anxious. 

I know I need these pills because I work in a high foot traffic job, full of people  and get anxiety because of the coronavirus going around. Last week I couldn't even function doing my job. 

But what's worrying more than catching corona are these pills. Any advice would help. Thanks.",5,"{'rona': 2, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5646862}"

I'm still not sure what is happening though, and neither are the doctors under whose care I've been for years. My best guess has been clonazepam withdrawal but I haven't heard of it lasting this long. I was on about 2 mg for 10 years, then tapered over 6 weeks. Symptoms have been going on for almost 12 months now and I have not yet noticed any sort of improvement (if they have improved or worsened it's been too gradual for me to notice).

Most things that are going on seem attributable to something else, from allergies to acid reflux and general bodily inflammation, but nothing adds up. All of these new things started up within the same 2 day period and the day or day after my last dose. They don't respond at all to treatments for what they're supposed to be, and in fact those things make it worse (for instance I'm apparently allergic to allergy medicine). I don't get it. I had been quite ill long before all of this so it's all pretty bearable, but really freaking annoying and unpredictable. Plus the lightning shooting through my brain, I think I could probably do without it.

It's very possible, I will acknowledge, that some of this is some form of anxiety triggering physical symptoms but I wouldn't really know. I was not prescribed clonazepam for anxiety, have never been diagnosed with it, and have no real conception of what it feels like. So if I have it now, it's new. I'm not sure if it could do all this. Maybe it could, I just honestly do not know since I was always the opposite of anxious even before clonazepam. At one point I made a list of all symptoms that were ""new"", back in July, and it was just shy of 30. It's grown a bit since then. These things were not there 10 years ago. What WAS there, and what the clonazepam was meant to treat, is a bit worse, yes. But where did the rest of this come from, if it is not withdrawal? And if it is not withdrawal, will it ever go away?

I created this Reddit account with the sole intention of typing this post and yet I didn't know, when I started typing, why I was posting. I think I know now. If anyone has any sort of experience, direct or otherwise, with withdrawal lasting this long or longer, I would appreciate hearing from you. I learned back in August that I could not rely on my physicians to guide me through this since they were saying the withdrawal should have ended by then. It is now almost April.

I have been on clonazepam (3mg) and lorazepam (3mg) = 90mg diazepam equivalent for the past 3 months (PTSD) which has improved greatly since :) I have decided it’s time to taper and am having trouble deciding my taper plan. I have read through the Aston manual and have discussed with my GP aspects of it such as substitution with diazepam. I have a couple of questions I’d like to ask.

1. I have only been on benzos for 3 months and I feel that using the Aston manual slow tapering may be too conservative given it’s more useful for benzo users for longer periods. Do you have any suggestions on how fast I should taper? E.g. 10% a week 25% a week? 

2. The role of supplements such as Kava, CBD or Ashwagandha? I have read reports that kava and Ashwaganha have GABA-A allosteric effects similar to benzos but have heard multiple anecdotes about their role in tapering. 

3. I am currently on 20mg of escitalopram and have started for a month beginning to have issues with sexual dysfunction and middle of the night insomnia (3am -6am) which I have been using promethazine to help sedate me. I have no issues with falling asleep with meditation and melatonin. I was considering switching over to mirtazapine and was wondering what the community thinks about that.

I've never thought before that benzos are so incredibly harmful. Sometimes I think that street drugs like heroin are safer to withdraw from. 

I was never on very high doses or for a very long time on benzos, I'm aware that there are many people which took it for a longer period and higher doses but I wanted to say that improvement is real and it gets better! 

One month ago I thought that I would die every moment and now I'm having more and more good hours were I can laugh about funny videos on YouTube.

Apparently GABA is partially produced in your gut, and certain strains will increase your GABA concentrations.

If anyone is trying to recover or withdraw, L rhamnosus and B longum will increase your GABA.

If you search “mood probiotics” these are typically the two strains included.

Honestly the lower dose might not work for you, especially for withdraws. I recommend 100 billion to 250 billion CFU’s if your going through a withdraw. 

If your not withdrawing I recommend a lower dose over a longer amount of time to get you GABA corrected.

I’ve taken high doses of these with great success, and stopped them with no withdraw effects, not intentionally just couldn’t afford it.

For the first 2 weeks I was feeling ok with 0.5mg then my psych doctor asked me to take 2.5mg which started on March 10. It wasn't feeling any withdrawals. I tried skipping for 3 days (everyother day) and I didn't give me withdrawals not until the other day I felt the mild muscle weakness (it's like I am about to have a fever) and a very mild anxiety. I am taking it again 0.25mg.

Our government has imposed a total lockdown and it made me feel anxious about my health so I started to take Vitamin C 3g.

It came to the point I was (still am) severely underweight because I couldn’t eat anymore due to all the stress. I’ve been using it for 4 weeks now, only two or three times a week only 5 mg because I am very aware of the dangers of them. It worked wonders for me. I felt relaxed, started to eat again, even on the days I didn’t use it. I wanted to stop taking them because my stress and anxiety started to settle down and these pills scare the hell out of me.I’m so scared that I will get addicted or have to go to withdrawal.

But, since I have jaw issues, which cause all the muscles in my whole body to cramp, which causes a lot of pain and sometimes gives the feeling I can’t breath, I’ve noticed Oxazepam also helps those muscles to relax. My dentist works on the problem, but it just takes so much time. 

Right now I’m scared of taking them, but they do work for the pain. Do you guys think it would be bad to continue use for 2 times a week only 5 mg?

I am dealing with some very severe emotional trauma and not able to get any sleep (yes, I've tried other, cleaner/natural aids such as melatonin).  

I'm not concerned as much with addiction potential, so much as triggering withdrawal symptoms even after a single (or 3) dose of gabapentin.  THAT is what I can't do again.  Even if it's just a few days of withdrawal symptoms, I don't think I could handle that right now.  

I see a lot of posts (and mixed opinions) about using gabapentin *for* benzo withdrawal, but what about long after that's done?  Am I safe?  I see posts here sometimes about people drinking alcohol again long after they're off benzos, and some people seem to tolerate it fine, while for others, a single night of reasonable drinking is excruciating with the return of withdrawal symptoms the day after.  I imagine it's similar with gabapentin, but was really hoping some people with experience could share thoughts and/or offer advice.

I think I know we all have anxiety issues here. I'm hoping some other people can share some tips or suggestions. 

This is about the global nightmare we just starting in the West ATM. Please don't read further if you are scared.

I tapered from a 7 year Xanax problem at the end of January of this year. By then I had some really odd chat going on with a friend about the situation in China. It became some strange interest and I've seen and read so much.

Needless to say I was initially not THAT worried as we were told a load of pure bullshit. 

For a while it was ok, then I saw this coming and spent as much as I could on these foods. Everyone here was going mad at me and saying I was insane. Sadly I really wasnt.

The UK's and everyone else's pure, criminal LIES. Disgust me. They clearly knew in advance or are they all absolute buffoons? 

I think I'm killing my elderly mother off who already has heart problems. I'm frantic. I haven't slept till I started finding spare benzos again. Let's be honest they do calm us down.

Now, as an adult due to situational circumstance I'm at my elderly parents house, alongside a hyper chondriac at times, but servely asthmatic adult brother who is again in the folks house due to this nightmare.

I can see my mum about to drop dead from me crying and washing up all the time. She's getting worse every day as she's a mum, she's scared for her adult babies. 

The media won't stop. And it's the beginning. They even cough on TV.  They just panic everyone every day. Saying how we have run out of beds at some hospitals.

I can see my mum, she's on the way out with stress. I am too I suddenly check symptoms. Checking my breathing and tingles etc. All  four of us weren't that fit to start with.

My other brother is a taxi driver, who was told to self isolate. I made him a care package and opened the gates in the middle of the morning so he could have things to eat! The cab company haven't said anything to anyone too. 

My friends in London have been so,so ill and noone helps. Noone has anything and this is the UK!??!

This is just the very beginning. 

Our heath service the NHS was not able to cope even before this. Now our nurses and drs are dying. They have no protection, we have fuck all tests and nowhere near enough units required nor staff. Our carers are wearing bin bags for protection.  

The people here have stockpiled so they can't find things either. They storm supermarkets like animals. I am in an elderly affluent area. Noone cares. The old people have nothing.

Most of us have a medical background and with Reddit and my initial fascination now utter complete horror. I'm begging people not to go to the shop or come near me. My father who I've never got on with insists on trying to get fucking chocolate! Totally unnecessary stupid things and doesn't care about our welfare. I have never hated anyone before.

I'm scaring everyone and myself to death. I'm scared of my elderly little dog who I adore. I can't cope. My private drs have even vanished.

I'm scared of my mum and brother being scared. I'm scared of them getting this. We are terrified beyond words. Even the post is now a threat.

I can't go back to London as the area where I'm based in is terribly affected and the media are not telling us or the world the real truth. It's chaos.

The government and our own citizens are idiots. All the shops have no food. People are panic buying for miles. They don't obey social distancing or seem to think this is just a load of over hyped find. They want to go to pubs!?

We have no parecetamol. The UK suppliers are running out too.

My mum's running out of heart medication and noones picking up. Everyone is already falling.

We have powered food, some pasta and some tins to eat. 

Please can any of you share with me some tactics to not kill us all off prematurely. 

I'm the only one here that seems to be trying to do things such as get a supermarket delivery order in two weeks. There are not any more after this! None!!

I had found it so helpful to me in my journey, and I want to share about it. In 2007 at age 17, I was put on Klonopin 1mg a day for social anxiety. I kept taking it up until almost a full year ago— where I was taking 2-2.5mg of Klonopin a day and would also “recreationally” eat Xanax bars (3-4 bars at a time). I had become an addict and I wanted to numb out the destruction I was bringing to my life. I was fucking up at work, my husband didn’t want to be around me, and things were strained with my parents. I started lurking this sub because I knew it was ruining my life. 

Finally in May 2019 I went to rehab where they did a month-long phenobarbital taper on me. And holy shit, it was rough. I would flip out at the slightest irritation. I laid in bed, immobilized by nausea. I’d cry at the drop of a hat. I could go on, but you get the picture. I came home at the end of June, after deciding to resign from my fulltime job and focus on my recovery. I was shaky and it was a difficult adjustment. I even “slipped up” 2 times—once after finding old Kpin lying around at home, and again after seeking it out. But mostly, I reminded myself that even if it feels unbearable, the anxiety will eventually pass. It always does. 

Coming on this sub helped me when I was feeling weak. I was reminded how shitty withdrawal and dependency are, and stayed away. I also felt good offering advice to other people in my situation. I didn’t feel so alone. So, thanks for that. Thanks to avoiding benzos, my anxiety improved on its own. I still have my moments, but it’s manageable. If I can get through May 2019, I can get through anything. Now I’m working again and I’m performing better than ever. I’m no longer embarrassing myself by being sedated 24/7. My relationships have been redeemed. And most importantly, I am fucking proud of myself and have some self-worth now.

For all you still tapering or otherwise struggling, don’t give up. It can only get better. If you give up, you’ll be faced with either having to go through withdrawal all over again or just be a slave to a pill for the rest of your life. Get support from a psychiatrist, esp if they specialize in addictions. If your doctor is an enabling idiot, get a new one. If you’re an addict like me, try stepping away from all drugs & get some therapy to address your real issues.

Dry heaving into a bucket most of the day Thursday/Friday

Couldn’t do anything it was too much, brain felt like it was being crushed, TV gave me a severe headache. Woke up 5-6 times in the night in a cold sweat, and having like 4 intensely vivid nightmares every night. I was the coldest I ever felt in my life, then I’d get hot, I was writhing in my sheets just shaking my head because it felt so awful. I wanted to leave my skin it was unbearable.

Today I spent most of the day convinced I was dying of starvation because my hands felt cold, and I felt freezing cold. I was going to die and it was urgent. My muscles in my body tensed completely. 

It’s only been 54 hours since my last dose (0.5mg Xanax), I am so grateful that I stopped sooner rather than later.
I still have them but I have zero desire to ever touch again, I feel like I dodged a bullet.

It has come in really intense waves, but the intensity has diminished quite rapidly. I was white knuckling it gripping onto the bed for my life and dry heaving for the first day and a half. My stomach seized up completely and whenever I ate it was intensely painful.

Today I can keep food down, but I was basically stuck in an adrenaline rush for the day, all muscles were tensed. It was painful, I did exercise but couldn’t relieve the tension. I started crying because it was so intense.

I had a nice period feeling okay writing this, but now a surge has come once again. I just want to relax before bed but I can’t. My breath is taken, my heart is squeezed, my muscles are tensed, I feel sick. I can feel the hairs on my arms stand up and I’m shaking. I’m not even fighting it, I tapped out of the fight ages ago. I am a limp ragdoll in the ring being thrown around. 

What’s keeping me going is that I can tell it’s getting weaker, the surge then felt suffocating but it was nothing compared to day 1. On day 1 I would sit bolt upright and start dry heaving, my stomach in knots spasming and not really doing its job, with intense coldness or heat radiating all over my body and a feeling like my skull was being crushed.

Those phantom sensations were the worst, but reading on here that it’s normal kept me mostly sane.

My heart goes out to those of you who have been on it for years. I’m having to take next week off work because I know I won’t quite be ready. However I am fortunate enough to know that the worst is gone and I will almost certainly be functional within a few more days, many here have no such assurance but the strength you show is incredible.

I'm a 25 year old male, 5ft9 and 70kgs. I've been tapering down diazepam under supervision of my psychiatrist. Was at 6mg daily when something very peculiar happened that left me and my doctor wondering what causes it.

During my taper I've had very predictable and consistent withdrawal symptoms. A few weeks ago however, I could suddenly no longer tolerate any diazepam. Taking a 1mg dose felt like I had taken 30mg, and it nearly knocked me out. This feeling stayed and I very rapidly decreased my dose as a response, as to not be overly sedated.

**30 x 1mg Xanax**

 I got it to help me quit smoking. It worked but I didn't fully realise the risks.

Generally I took it once or twice a day, but also skipped days. I used the most earlier this week , using 3/4mg per night for 2 nights in a row

Last night I used only 0.5mg and woke up absolutely drenched in sweat with an adrenaline rush and a cracking headache, as well as weird feeling, thought I was going to die. This occurred approx 36 hrs after the two nights taking 7 mg over both nights, It didn't last long but it was really intense and nearly made me take another 1mg but I didn't.

My usage was as follows 

15th Feb - 24 Feb (10 days): 0.5mg in afternoon and 0.5mg at night 10 days straight

25 Feb: None

26 Feb: Woke up in a cold sweat but didn't make the connection really

27 Feb - 15 March (16 days): 13mg in total which was dosed randomly, usually 0.5mg at a time

16 March: 4mg that night 

17 March: 3mg that night 

18 March: 0.5mg only 

19 March: Woke up drenched in sweat thinking I was about to die, headache and heart pounding. Absolutely terrifying. Within 10 minutes I felt normal apart from a bad headache.


I'm concerned that I'm either mildly dependent or on the cusp of being dependent, but I don't know if it could just be a Xanax hangover.

I got some valium but not sure whether to use them to taper because it could make me dependent when I might just be experiencing a hangover from the recent excessive use.


Anything to look out for and any advice?

I was residing in a country (not the country of origin) where Ativan was like a normal over-the-counter med being prescribed easily by psychiatrists to patients suffering from anxiety. I was taking it for almost 2 months at 1mg. 

Then I went back to the country where I am at right now.   Here, Ativan is banned so I was forced by my new psychiatrist to take diazepam 5mg. The first 3 days I was really jittering and more anxious then I got used to diazepam gradually. I had been taking diazepam 5mg for 2 weeks in exchange to Ativan 5mg. After 2 weeks I revisited my psychiatrist and he asked me to take 2.5mg instead everyday and so I did, and I have been taking 2.5 mg for almost 3 weeks now. I can feel the anxiety sometimes but I can manage. Also, I forgot to take it 3 days but not consecutively. I didn't feel any withdrawals.

My question is, will I experience the withdrawal in the end? Will I feel the derealization just others felt recovering from benzos?

- Introducing pregabalin in my treatment and, when ready, stop taking Xanax;
- Stop Xanax and evaluate if I need to introduce pregabalin.

Hi! 
I’m tapering off 2.5 mg Klonopin/day. Right now I’m down to 1.5, going down .25 mg every two weeks. This is my second time doing this. I am under ‘supervision’ of my psychiatrist, though I only see him about once a month. I’ve been on it five years (with an eight month break when I went off last time), only ever by prescription and my prescribed dose. I also take 2 mg Ativan/day as needed (around 3-6 times a week) for panic attacks, 20 mg Lexapro for depression and recently, back on 50 mg Seroquel at night for sleep. This happened before I started Seroquel and I had not taken Ativan that day. 

So, my Q is- how bad is it to have alcohol? Last time I tapered, I drank at least once a week, not always getting drunk but usually a larger amount. This time around, I hadn’t drank for 4-5 months and decided to have a few beers. I had two tall cans of 5.5% beer and had hallucinations, tremors, sweats etc as the beer would’ve been leaving my system. This has never happened to me other than alcohol DT’s years ago. I don’t plan on touching it for the rest of my titration. Was that a normal reaction? How does it affect you?",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52527726}"

I know this title sounds alarmist, but I doubt I’m the only one here thinking it.  I rapidly tapered myself off of Klonopin after 7 years of daily usage of 1.5-3mgs by switching to Diazepam and then going down from 20mgs of Diazepam by 5mgs every three or four days over two weeks. Note: I only did this to get into an alcohol addiction program that does not have a medical director and therefore does not allow benzos of any kind. Last Wednesday night I had my last dose of .5 Diazepam, so the drug was probably completely out of my system by Friday night (March 6th). Today I am feeling worse than I have felt so far. I don’t feel like eating and when I try, I have to stop Because I feel too sick. I haven’t stepped on a scale but I know just by looking in the mirror that I’ve lost a fairly significant amount of weight (for me that would be anything over 5lbs). I have the runs so can’t really keep food in. I keep feeling these brain “zaps” if that makes any sense, get dizzy when I try to move. I Quito cold turkey once before when I was 26 (ten years ago), and my fitness addiction probably kept me sane. But when I tried to do a spin class yesterday, I got dizzy after 10 minutes and had an excruciating headache.

I was at a one week detox facility last week and when they did my labs, my immune function was normal but I feel weaker than I can remember feeling. So now, along with feeling absolutely horrible physically, I’m wondering if I basically shouldn’t leave the house. I live in America. 

Any advice on either ways to get through this week one of Benzo Withdrawal or if anyone knows any Immune system impacts, would be greatly appreciated.

I think that it’s difficult for me to write this post because since I was first prescribed medication of any kind (combo of mood stabilizers, vyvanse and shortly after klonopin) I was only 16 years old and now I’m 23, almost 24. Since then, things have mostly been a haze of being medicated, learning to self medicate and essentially indecision and floating wherever life takes me including good situations that I took for granted and dangerous situations that I simply ignored. Really hating myself right now. Time to...develop a value system I think? To replace my constant desire to alter/control how I feel or completely numb my feelings all together. 
After some life changing circumstances I have found myself in a living situation where my addictions won’t be swept under the rug and I guess part of my brain decided to finally admit that I am an addict. 
To keep this short and possible to write, I went to rehab twice when I was 18 specifically for benzos but really hadn’t felt like I had enough time or life experience to identify as an addict. I then moved into a halfway house for a month, got kicked out for something non relapse related but of course relapsed on alcohol right away. In between that time and now, there were a few failed relationships and mental health and addiction getting increasingly worse without acknowledging it. Ignorance. 
Benzos did not come back into the picture until a year ago. I started to buy them from a friend who at this point sells me almost her entire script. Maybe 20 kpins a month. I’ve been really binging on them since probably late summer early fall. Being completely wreckless. lo and behold I’m totally addicted again. I’ll take up to 4 mg a day sometimes, on days where I know I will be facing something “extra anxiety inducing” such as a gathering with my (now ex) boyfriends friends, a literal therapy session which I end up not remembering, being around my bosses etc etc. and then have to go days without in which I just simply white knuckle through the day or drink a lot after work etc. I have other sources for getting them too which I occasionally will pursue....but I’m done. DONE. This is no fucking way to live! My life has fallen apart and I’ve made some huge mistakes that could have potentially really hurt people and myself- not to mention the emotional turmoil I’ve put people through in being worried about me. I’m now no longer living with my ex but with a family member- it’s ok. It’s safe. It’s my best option. But I’m dealing with heartbreak, new home, lost 1 of 2 of my jobs, SHAME and the physical symptoms of withdrawals from benzos and alcohol are all too much. I’ve stopped drinking after a bender last weekend and have lowered my dose of Xanax to 2.5 mg. I wait until I absolutely need to take them at the end of the day when I can’t sleep. I only have 1 dose left and I could get more but am too depressed in all honesty. I wish I could but I can’t afford to lose my other job and go to rehab.

I started taking benzos 1 year and half ago, using dosages like 2mg of Xanax in the mid of the proccess but I am like 10 months or more in dosages equivalent to something lower than 0.5mg of Xanax.

What sounds like a good plan for the next step? Is the Valium switch still worth in my case? Is it better to increase my SSRI to make things easier anxiety wise? What if in my current regimen I already have some waves?

I jumped because I didn’t know not to. I found Reddit and this community when I felt like I was going insane and was trying to figure out what was happening to me. Thank you Google. Thank you Reddit. Those early days almost seem easier in some ways because the physical detox symptoms were so very bad I had no awareness of what was to come.

Reality is what comes. Realizing how being on benzos in the first place totally fucked up how I was living my life. Moving through trauma after trauma and psychologists just telling me to take my meds because “some people have to be in them forever”. 

So here I am now not “protected” by the cushion the benzos bring. I’m forced to live in the stark reality and consequences of the last 10 years of running amuck in benzo land.

I can see where I made bad financial decisions, bad relationship decisions, including leaving a 3 year relationship about 6 months prior to my jump...and it may have been one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made or the best decision I ever made, I truly am not sure....yet. 

I’ve given up alcohol for a year and a half. It’s isolated me from my entire previous social network. My 29 year old daughter moved to Seattle in October, my other daughter lives in Jacksonville...I miss my girls terribly. My 21 year old son still lives with me and here is a bright spot in being benzo and alcohol free, he and I are doing much better. 

I’ve had to PUSH myself to stay connected. I do work two jobs so I’m out of the house quite often. I try and get yoga classes in when I’m not working. I’ve met someone through online dating [try that while recovering... 😳]...he lives an hour and a half away and after spending a fun weekend together last weekend in my area I’m traveling to him this afternoon to spend time on his turf. It’s taking everything in me not to text or call and say, whoops! Sorry don’t know what I was thinking...

But if I’m going to have a new life I have to live in the reality that no one can create it for me except me. I’m taking it in little bites. I have a LONG way to go in learning how to live in the new skin, this new mind. I have to remember to be patient with myself while I’m learning how to live this new way. Being so freakin aware.

Anywhere from .5mg-1mg nightly. Sometimes 2mg but that’s usually if my anxiety is very bad. I only take it at night because that’s when my anxiety is at full peak. No distractions, racing mind. I can’t sleep. Xanax just helps me feel normal. I’ve been diagnosed with depression/anxiety formally from my doctor but I self treat with the Xanax. I’m worried about long term use more than anything and would like to be able to quit and maybe find a better solution. I tried to stop a few weeks ago and didn’t sleep for 4 day’s and was having panic attacks like I’ve never had before, had some stomach issues, chills. My body is extremely sensitive to everything, I get the side effects from a fucking zpack. So I went back to .5mg nightly.

I don’t have health insurance and also don’t feel like I need to be in a hospital to detox. I’m not sure if I should have an honest conversation with my doctor or try this on my own again. I have gabapentin and lexapro but I’m not sure how to taper correctly and how to use these meds to help through it. Any advice would be great.

I have depression and anxiety, and had been taking Lexpro (5-10mg) plus Xanax (up to 0.5mg) for 4 months. Coming off of Lexapro was not pleaseant, but it was very doable and never did I feel like ""OMG I need to take another dose or I'm gonna die :-((("", even though it was CT. The worst was seriously dark and depressed mood for a week or two, but there was no no real desire to ""end it"". There was dizziness and brain zaps, which at the time seemed serious, but man, after trying to quit Xanax, my definiton of ""serious"" totally changed and now I regard antidepressant withdrawal as probably ""mild"" on an absolute scale. There's no need to over explain Xanax withdrawal, I'll just say I couldn't do it CT because I would get these terrible adrenaline rushes and feeling of impending doom, felt totally mad and often though the only way to get out of this is to ""end it"". It was a cachophony of terrible symptoms. After switching to Valium and tapering, I can say I'm in a much better state and I'm ""almost there"".

Now, I see the antidepressant was very beneficial to my state of being. My main problem is depression and this unexplicable fatigue that is not improved by sleep, and to be honest it may be because my sleep is not very good. Anyway, 2 months into treatment and I find my fatigue is basically gone for the first time in years, my mood is much better and people are commenting ""you look like yourself again"". All very good. The issue was there was light/sound sensitivity and this crazy anxiety which made me feel like I'm living in a crowded pub with music blasting even though it's just two people next to me and radio playing on minimum volume. I had to quit it, and with it came to realize that at least half of my issues came not from the antidepressant but from Xanax interdose withdrawal (rebound anxiety), because I got hooked on it and seemed to perpetually be living in a state of withdrawal.

My plan for the future is to continue taking some sort of antidepressant, but on it's own, without a benzo that is. ""No more benzos!"", I said to my psychiatrist. As I've said, I find them truly beneficial, not like benzos which are just some sort of ""band aid"" thing that doesn't adress any of the underlying issues.

Now, you guys have experienced benzo withdrawal and some of you probably have taken an antidepressant too, and I seek your opinion on this matter. Do you think antidepressants taken long term is ultimately not any better than taking benzos? Will my ""serotonin system"" get f****d up and I'll be left in ruins, it just takes a longer time? I'll admit I probably have PTSD after going through benzo withdrawal and I've become deathly afraid of being on medication long term due to fear of being screwed up, and I'm in need of some encouragement.

I started taking Klonopin about 6 months ago after my doctor prescribed it to me to help me quit drinking (which I have been successful at so far, yay!). Unfortunately, like many alcoholics, I just traded one thing for the other. Within a couple of months I was taking .5-1 mg of (illicitly acquired) Klonopin every day. I kept this up for a couple of months until I decided I had to stop digging this hole. I did a lot of research on things to help with the taper and withdrawal, and found a number of anecdotes on Reddit that a peptide, BPC-157, was extremely helpful for benzo tapering.

I had actually used BPC-157 with success before to repair a muscle injury, but learned that it could also be used to repair GABA receptors. I started taking 500 mcg/day (split into two doses, usually via subcutaneous injection but sometimes I'd put it up my nose) in late January, and began my taper around the beginning of February. I started at .5 mg klonopin and reduced my dosage by 1/16 of a mg every 3-4 days.

I noticed after about a week of taking BPC-157 (but before I started my taper) that it seemed like the Klonopin was working a lot better, like my tolerance had been reduced (which is what I was hoping would happen). Throughout the entire taper, discomfort has been pretty minimal. I usually had a couple hours per day of being a bit anxious, occasionally canceled social plans, short bouts of nausea, and had a few gruesome nightmares, but overall I'd rate the discomfort at a 2/10.

Last week, once I had gotten to 1/8 mg per day, I had a couple of days where I found it really difficult to get anything done. Picked up some kratom and it has been smooth sailing since. My last dose was on Friday and the whole weekend I felt pretty great (obviously due to the kratom, but it really was masking 100% of the negative effects of withdrawal).

It's now been almost 72 hours since my last dose and I feel quite alright. This is my first rodeo with benzos - if its been so easy this far, am I pretty much in the clear at this point? Or should I be prepared for things to get a lot worse in the next couple weeks?

I've been addicted to kratom a couple of times so I know I can't stay on it - was planning on riding it through the first week of being completely benzo free and then come off and see how I feel.

I know my situation is much more mild than most here (only being on benzos for a few months, never going on large doses), but based on anecdotes I've found around reddit, BPC-157 is very helpful even for people with serious benzo problems. Since I've never had a benzo problem before, I've never had to taper before, so I cannot compare an experience without BPC-157. Do some research and consider giving it a shot.",4,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6620488}"

It makes me so depressed, and I constantly feel unreal. I feel like if I had benzos right now I’d take them. I’m glad I cut off everyone who got them for me so I can’t though. I’ve been clean for just over 100 days. 

For those who’ve recovered, does this feeling linger, or does it go away? My anxiety is through the roof right now and it’s almost unbearable.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.92449886}"

I don’t know what to do,"He told me that he’s had it with me. We were supposed to go out with friends tonight, but I told him to go without me. I have a grad school essay due tomorrow and everything is taking me twice as long and I’m afraid that tomorrow might be a bad day and it will be worse. So our friends cancelled our plans, even though I begged them not to. He said he’s embarrassed by it even though he made the plans just today. 

He was asking for a BJ all day and I’ve just been keeping to myself. This shit has killed my sex drive and we’re intimate maybe once every two months now (he’s gone for work half of the time, too). I get that it’s frustrating but does he want me to force myself? I’m trying to get better and back to normal. 

I’ve asked him to be patient with me during my WD. He says “I’ve been patient with you for three years,” which is when I was first prescribed clonazepam. I never took more than prescribed. I’ve wanted to go off so many times but my doctor flat-out said no until our last appointment when I told him it needs to go, and we’re having no more conversations about it. 

This shit has taken everything from me. He’s all I have left. I gave up my life, my career, my entire identity because we moved to another city because of his new job three years ago. My doctor prescribed clonazepam to get through that and some other shit that happened at the same time. 

He doesn’t believe this is real. I started tapering three weeks ago. He said that he’s had it with me. I’m trying to move forward by getting into grad school but now I fear that I won’t even get my essay done because I’m falling apart even faster now. This isn’t fair. I didn’t do anything wrong. This drug has taken everything from me. He thinks I can control this. You all know that I can’t.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88489944}"
