2021-03-30 19:34:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/mgsys6/need_helpadvice/,Need help/advice :(,"I’ve been extremely overworked and stressed out over the last few months (I just started working a very demanding job in which I have to literally be In front of people all day and help them) and It has led to me relapsing on benzos. I started exactly 2 1/2 weeks ago with a prescription of 30 .5mg of Ativan (fairly low, but took them daily and in between week 1-2, alongside alcohol), ran out after a tad bit under a week, went and got 10 pressed xannies (not sure what was in them, definitely a benzo though and I’m sure it’s alp due to the taste but who knows, right? lol) and finished those last Wednesday (1 day shy of 2 weeks), and then... My Ambien refill came (I usually just binge on it for a bit under a week, to avoid dependency, get some good sleep, and a buzz.. y’all know what’s up) and I’ve been using it nearly daily, aside from last Saturday when I finally convinced myself to take a break. 

Now, I have a few extra bars lying around that I’ve been saving for an emergency, but I’ve been having mild withdrawals (at least I think, could be a plethora of other things. I am a daily Kratom user and I drink noble kava almost daily, which has been a godsend for GABA drug replacement, but as with most plant medicines, it’s nothing like the real deal. It’s not physically addictive at least) in the form of muscle spasms, random jolts, stiff muscles, and just a sense of unease. Is this actually mild withdrawals or am I just paranoid? I’ve recently quit nicotine as well, but I was not a super heavy user. Idk man, I just want to stop this cycle of binging monthly because I’ve been doing it for a good 5ish months and I’m tired. Half the month I’m benzd out, one week of recovery, and one week where I actually feel like a normal human, rinse & repeat. I do eat a healthy diet (little sugar, vegetarian, barely any junk food, lots of tea, etc), meditate, exercise, and sleep relatively well. 

If you’ve stuck around up this point, what should I do? Should I keep taking my Ambien to help wean me off? (I only have a few left, 10mg, and I take on average about 10mg on a controlled night to upwards of 30mg, which Is why I run out so fast, but than again that’s the whole point...)

Edit: I did mention that this started recently, obviously as stated, I started about 5ish months ago, but this month was the first time in at least a year that I’ve taken any kind of street benzo which has really fucked up my usual monthly routine. I don’t want to escalate this usage any further than I already have :(",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.512718}"

Everyone said I would get better but I never did. I don't know if that is because I was put on Remeron 8 months off benzos or because my brain just got destroyed.

I'm officially at the point where I am willing to commit suicide because the strongest person in the world could not survive what I have endured. Especially 24/7 for 2.5 years nearly. The fact I am alive is beyond a miracle. 

I don't really know what my options are. I tried one dose of .25mg Xanax about a year ago and it made my symptoms and akathisia much worse and I ended up on Zyprexa for 2 weeks and when I quit that I had severe pacing akathisia. walking 18 hours a day for months with my brain racing so fast. 

Starting an SSRI is risky considering how bad I am normally since they have start-up anxiety. The only thing I can think of is gabapentin or some sort of mood stabilizer that hits glutamate.

Feels like I'm sensitive to everything and relieving my painful anxiety, even if momentarily was blissful. Didn't seem to throw me back into full one withdrawal but I still feel ashamed.

Seeing how some people don't feel normal years after stopping usage isn't very motivating as well. My life has improved tremendously after quitting, but it's not enough for me to be able to enjoy life as I used to. I don't want to spend the rest of my life just obsessively watching my diet, sleep, exercise, etc while waiting to recover. I look at my peers and get jealous that they have a functioning brain that lets them enjoy life without being a over-stressed hypochondriac. 

I want to believe there is, or will be a way to at least speed up the recovery.  Ordered a bunch of supplements like L-theanine, lion's mane, NAC, black seed oil, Bacopa, vitamins and some other stuff that theoretically helps to return the balance of GABA and glutamate in the brain. Some seem very rough on the stomach and some increase symptoms. Planning on trying them one by one and try to see if any of them can speed up the recovery.

I know that the basics of sleep, diet and exercise are the most important but it's still not fast enough. I want to be able to have a drink with my friends or just spend a week calmly without random health anxiety that convinces I'm dying.

Another thing - there are no drugs or supplements without side effects, no magical fix and considering thee brain is so complicated I doubt we'll see it in our lifetimes. Are we here just to suffer?

**TL;DR:**

I’ve taken 200mg of Valium over the period of a month, mostly daily. I’m looking for recommendations on tapering, or wondering if it’s even necessary at all?

**Long:**

Recently I’ve been taking a decent amount Valium over the course of about a month or so. I know for a fact I’ve taken approx. 200mg in that timespan. 

The last time I dosed I took 5mg Sunday morning, and I’ve just decided that I don’t really want to take the drug on a day to day bases anymore, and I don’t really see myself using it much more in the future (mostly for stim comedowns and trip-killers). 

Now I know that in most cases tapering is essential, but as my use only went on for one month is it as necessary for me?

The reason I’m asking for advice is that on days I don’t dose (today especially) I am a little irritable and my Fitbit tells me I have a very high heart rate. I went for a casual slow walk earlier and my hr went all the way up to 155 and one point and I can sometimes feel it in my chest - mostly at night. 

I’m a bit scared of the consequences as I’ve heard a lot of bad about quitting cold turkey. Would dosing 2.5mg every other day for two weeks or so be enough to help?

I’ve been on clonazepam at .5mg twice a day- morning and night, for the past 15 months.

The past 8 weeks or so I went through an outpatient detox for opioids, and the detox clinic I went to had me on 2.5mg lorazepam 4x’s a day for 2 weeks.

Immediately after, I switched over to 4mgs of clonazepam (2mg day 2mg night) and tapered to my original daily .5mg day .5mg night. (I knew I would get mad rebound withdrawal from such a huge dose increase, even for a short period- why 4mgs? I just wanted back down ASAP.)

Anyway the past month or so getting back down to just 1mg a day has been really rough. I cannot even imagine what coming off the 1mg is going to feel like. I’m more scared than ever in my life honestly.

Anyway; Online charts contradict each other- some say .5mg of clonazepam =  5mg diazepam, some say .5mg clonazepam= 10mg diazepam and some say .5mg clonazepam = 20mg diazepam. 

I fought so damn hard to get down from the temporary lorazepam increase/blast of 10mg a day- and it’s been hell- I don’t want to take more diazepam than I should when transferring to it from the clonazepam (my country only has 2mg clonazepam pills making it impossible to taper) I want to take all this progress with me over in the transfer.

I also have lupus and RA. I've been most heavily on ativan for the past 4 years, taking up to 3-5mg a day for SFN. I know I never should have been on that much for that long, but it was all I could take for the nerve pain. The neurologist who prescribed it retired (thankfully-- he was clearly not very good) and I found a new neurologist who has the SFN pain 90% under control with new medications. So she's tapering me off the ativan as she won't prescribe it any more. I 100% agree with her I want to be off of it completely. So over a few months I backed myself down to taking only .25/day and then .25 every 2-3 days only when the nerve pain started flaring. This past 2 weeks I went the longest without it.

But last night I had to take three doses of .25. I had a major SFN flare. This was probably from getting vaccinated (and I'm not anti-vaxx! I'm happy to get it done and will still get shot #2!) as it can make people with autoimmune diseases flare a bit. Well, I flared badly and the only way I could calm my body down was to take the ativan. I hate that I took it again. I can tell it makes me angry/edgy/depressed when it starts to wear off, and I am not usually that kind of person. 

So I am going to have to back down again. I have about 20 1mg pills, and have been quartering them. Should I go back to .25 every day, then every few days, and then try to go 2 weeks or more? I'm worried about just stopping cold turkey.",2,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6968842}"

Now, even though there is a really cold wind blowing through here sometimes, it seems like most of why I even use reddit is this sub. Wonder who else stays afterward from the new and deeply etched feeling of there being something actually important happening here.

But the pain caused for partners and parents and children, it does not seem to get attention. Then after the taper, people float away very often. And why not? It is a huge burden to carry the memory. It makes me wonder how many of the ""20.5k"" here are not tapering, but looking out for those they love. Can I maybe get a show of hands? Are you even remotely the same person now? Have you healed?

Looking to setup support for families and loved ones of those who are tapering. Gearing toward people who really understand. But also providing ""extra support"" beyond the taper itself, such as with not going homeless, keeping a marriage going, being a half-way decent doggie parent, maybe even human parent too. I feel like everything around the taper is the thing which hurts most for those who have so much sensitivity and love. I see how hard my wife fought to ""stay functional"" in a household, not from shame, but from the sincere desire to hold presence.

I know that even though we were married for many years before my wife started to taper, even while she was tapering there were so many things I didn't understand. It was like being a moron for years straight ( not an unfamiliar feeling, being male )

With that kind of knowledge gap with someone right in your face, it seems like preparing families is a huge necessity, and maybe we can avoid some divorces, suicides, and displacements from home because people are not rallied around by the community. People get disowned when they ought to be surrounded, and loved ones get ostracized because of the ultra party-pooper people don't want coming around.

I'm currently tapering, but I'm struggling (and am actually quite obsessed with) how to proceed so I could really use some help. If you want to read more about my situation, scroll down, but for the lazy ones like me here\`s a tl;dr:

tl;dr: tapering off Benzos, have real Lorazepam and ""Diazepam"" from darknet, don\`t know how to proceed and need opinion about my two alternative taper plans.

&#x200B;

Current situation: I have been taking Lorazepam for about seven weeks at 0.5 to 1.5 times every one or two days for the first few weeks. After four weeks I didn't have any and got really uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. I should say that I was taking Lorazepam at these quantities in 2015 for about half a year, but during tapering I never felt that miserable back then (kindling, I guess?)

So I went to my general practitioner, who then prescribed lorazepam, but obviously has no idea what tapering means ...At the same time I ordered ""Diazepam"" from the darknet to switch (I know about the Ashton Manual and switching to a longer acting one, that\`s why). My gp is like ""no, that\`s out of question to switch, you just substitute one drug with another""....)

Whether it is really diazepam, not sure. Feels very similar, but actually no idea (blue Diaz with DAN 5620 front / 10 back, but no originals). However, it is definitely Benzos, more sedative and longer effective than Lorazepam. But yeah, not too comfortable about not \[i\]really\[i\] knowing if it is Diazepam.

It's been over seven weeks now, and I've been tapering for two weeks. I started with Lorazepam (1mg / day: 0.5 -0 -0.5). Big sleep problems, after two days severe withdrawal symptoms and I switched to the ""Diaz"". I've been taking it for seven days and currently at 8.5 mg (two times a day: 3,5 - 5,0) with only slight withdrawal symptoms sometimes (tingling, hot arms and chest).

What I noticed: I get along better with the blue ""Diaz"", can sleep better and only have few withdrawal symptoms.

Two days ago I was in an addiction clinic to get advice from experts on what my taper plan could look like for the next few weeks and which benzo I should continue with. However, they only want to detoxify in-patient, which is currently out of the question for me and I would like to try it (first) myself. But at least they gave the advice to take it slow (I know about the Ashton Manual and stuff already) and should take six to eight weeks for the taper.

I've also gone to addiction counseling twice and found a self-help group, which is great.

&#x200B;

Okay, a lot of text so far ... my question is: how should I proceed? With pharmaceutically perfect lorazepam (which would again represent a change for my body) or with the previously better tolerated ""Diaz""?

What is your evaluation of this? And what do you think of the two taper plans I made?

If you are wondering, I only have the amount of pills you see on my schedule chart...

Thank you so much, I feel a little lost right now!

Any help would be great and much appreciated.,"Long story short, I overdosed on fentanyl and once I got out of the ER i went straight to my addiction doc to get clean. His protocol is 2 weeks of tapering subutex and then withdrawaling with comfort meds. He gave me 0.5mg klonopin and zofran for nausea. Me being the addict I am, I felt shitty so I picked up 40 green hulks and later got 90 farmaprams which were so weak compared to the hulks.

So I have 25 2mg farmaprams left and I do have the 0.5 prescribed k pins about 14 left that i take once every 8 hours. I also have 100mg gabapentin. I see my doc Monday so I was considering telling him my withdrawals from subutex are bad and maybe he would increase my k pins to 1mg. That way I have more to taper off as I run low on Xanax. But that’s wishful thinking that he would do that. But I guess I will find out soon. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to use what I have to taper? Or any advice? I want to be honest with my doc but I think he will just cut me off completely. I’ve been through the agony of Benzo withdrawal but I was using them much longer.

I think one thing that makes this process somewhat easier is speaking to other people who understand what it is like to withdraw from Benzos. I  have tried attending AA and NA meetings but personally, I did not feel I could resonate with the format of the meetings. I thought I would create a support group specifically for individuals who are going through withdrawals, who have already come off of Benzos but are still recovering, or for people who just started taking Benzos and want more insight in case they decide to taper down in the future. 

The format would be something like this: 

We meet once a week for 1 hour to share our personal journey with Benzos, discuss any difficulties we have been facing, do weekly check ins, and talk about anything that has potentially helped the withdrawal process. 

Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in and I will make it happen. I am really hoping to build a community where we can all talk openly about our experiences without judgment.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.51237506}"

I am posting here because I have no one I can talk to about what I am going through right now. Nobody knows that I have been taking 2 mg of klonopin everyday for the last 3 years (and Xanax for several years before that). No one can know. 

I am in a position now where I will not have access to the medicine anymore and am trying to wean myself off. Last month, I went down from 2 mg to 1 mg. Around the 14th day, I started feeling extremely irritable and my brain didn’t feel right. It felt like any time I so much as shifted my eyes, my brain would shudder. Sort of like if you can imagine seeing something really gross and how it makes you shudder. That’s the best way I know how to explain it. I also felt dizzy and kind of nauseas. One day, the nausea was bad enough that I vomited. Well, I spent several days like this, crying nearly all day and screaming at my kids for the smallest things due to being so irritable and then one day I just felt normal again. At the time, I wasn’t really sure if they were withdrawal symptoms, but now I am fairly sure they were. 

At the start of this month (March), I cut the dose again. I’m now taking 0.5 mg once per day and a couple days ago I started having the same symptoms. Depressed, irritable, and weird brain feeling. I’m also feeling really restless and my hands are sweaty. I feel like I can barely type this post out because I feel so damn uncoordinated with my movements and, again, every time my eyes shift, my brain feels this weird shudder sensation. 

The weird brain sensation I think is honestly the worst part and it is starting to scare me. I can only pray that this feeling goes away in a few days like it did last month. But even if it does, I am sure it will return again when I cut the dose again. 

I have a small supply of 2 mg tablets, and the absolute smallest I can cut them is 0.25 mg. I can’t break them any smaller. So I am going to have to jump off at 0.25 mg. Has anyone ever done this before with a similar history of taking benzos? I am really, really worried about that part. I guess my biggest fear is that I will end up having a seizure in front of my kids or while I am driving or something like that. I just don’t want to die or cause harm to anyone else. I feel like if I knew I wasn’t going to have a seizure during all this, I would feel much less anxious about it. 

I am so scared and just feel so alone in this. I got myself in this situation and have to get myself out, but I guess it would be reassuring to know others have got through this and survived. Does anyone know how likely seizures are in my case? And has anyone had this weird brain sensation and how long is it going to last? 

Thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read this. And I am sorry if it sounds all over the place, it is just the best I could manage to type out to be honest.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80254173}"

I have started an internship in what I like, where I will have to do my final master thesis, and I want to profit and learn from this experience as much as I can. Problem is, since I moved to the city where I am doing my internship, the appartement where I live has an old structure, floor made of wood and not very well isolated, so I can hear the footsteps, or someone opening a dresser. My room is located next to the stairs of the hallway, it's a second floor so I can hear people taking this stairs (and this noise is way more stronger).
I sleep with my boyfriend and he can usually sleep peacefully, if he wakes up sometimes during night, he can fall asleep quickly. But not in my case. We both go to bed between 23-00:00, and should wake up at 7:15, but I wake up at 6:00 usually, and this is the time were the neighbors living the upper floor start to get ready to go to work, so I hear their footsteps, opening entrance door (and thank goodness they don't usually use the stairs, because it's very Noisy).
My sleep is only deep if I take benzodiazépines (1mg) and still K can wake up at 6:00. I try not to take it everyday since this is such a harmful drug.
I can sometimes take sleeping pills for a lot of days (the ones with a substance that comes from allergy médecines and that you can buy in a pharmacy without an prescription).
I also have hypothyroidism, treated with levotiroxine since 7 years and has worked very well with my thyroid problem till now, where I have many stomach problems and sometimes I can sweat so much during night that I wake up with my body, pijama, bed...completely wet! 
I'm so scared of the noises of the neighbors that it tenses my body and prevents me to fall asleep again, or sometimes to go to sleep.
Most of the week days I end up sleeping 5h, and other times 6h with benzos with a deeper sleep. I feel so tired that when I leave work I just think I want to die. Life without good sleep is no life. Life with benzos is a life with memory problems, and worsening of my anxiety. Doctors will only prescribe me more benzos and hypnotic pills (way worse than benzos).
I would like to stop my anxiety pills. But I just can't. 
My boyfriend says that the noises are not so loud and that it's the minimum they can do.
If I don't sleep well, I don't work well. If so don't work well, I won't make a great master thesis and I won't get hired in the company.
I'm also trying with meditation but has only helped me to fall asleep fast at the beginning, not for when I wake up many times during the night.

If you are struggling, know you can do it and this is doable. And if your symptoms feel like they're lasting forever, just know it is NORMAL, give it time!!

I’d like to start by saying I have a extensive background in drug abuse and had recently 8 years sobriety that was squandered when I got my autoimmune diagnosis this year. I started using Kratom to deal with the chronic pain issues and it became too reminiscent of my years in the throws of true opiate addiction so it’s time to stop. I was surprised to find that when I began my Kratom taper that I actually felt some substantial withdrawals from it. Even though the withdrawal is minor compared to coming off other opiates - it’s still enough to flair my chronic pain issues into excruciating pain. 
Anyhow I live just a few miles from Mexico and decided to get a pack of 10 mg diazepams to assist my CT Kratom quit. 
Back ten years ago I abused Xanax pretty regularly but for some reason never experienced much withdrawal when I quite. I was coming off methadone at the same time and maybe that just. Over powered my withdrawal experience idk. 

I’d like to go at this with a game plan so I can stick to a strict protocol. I know that  once the diazepam enters my system my decision making is influenced by the drug and I want to nail down a attack plan to stick to before I take anything and start my Kratom quit. 

My question is this. - I expect the acute Kratom withdrawal to last around 5-10 days. Is this a small enough window to dose diazepam daily without evoking dependence and withdrawal?

After this period i plan on switching to drinking good kava for a while to make the transition off the diazepam as painless as possible. 
But also because I drink kava all the time regardless

I am 9 years off a 10 year high dose stint of Klonopin. I never fully recovered. I am not trying to scare anyone, my story is probably very unusual, I abused high doses for many years along with other drugs. I tried cold turkey twice, eventually tapered off, it didn't go very well, I think trying those cold turkeys did a lot of damage too.

There were long periods where I felt pretty much fine. I wrote a success story at one point. But the symptoms do just keep coming back. These symptoms and periods usually get briefer and more manageable as time went on. However this more constant feeling of sleep deprivation and exhaustion has been present more often than not.

A few months ago I think I had COVID. It was very mild and I recovered quickly. But I still have the ""COVID toes"", which is what makes me think it was COVID. And I have felt totally run down ever since. Then 5 days ago I took a Zyrtec and had a very bad reaction. It sent me into what feels like acute withdrawals, with a pounding heart and now since last night significant paresthesias/nerve pain like I haven't had in many years.

I just give up at this point. If I thought getting back on would solve the problem I think I would. But I am not confident it would. I'd like to try something like Lyrica/Gabapentin. Do you think this is a good or bad idea; what is your experience with it? Of course I will consult a doctor and get a script.

I now have to drag myself to the doctor to make sure I'm ok, which will precipitate a lot of anxiety. I am so frustrated and disheartened. I'd welcome any words of encouragement or advice.

I really think I don't need them anymore so I feel the counter effects now. It will be hard to go only to a one capsule or half but I did it other times when I was hospitalized. Now, I am doing bymyself. I know it too much...   
After a week I just feel better without that amounts, little moments of anxiety but it was only psychological I think. I never tried waht you wrote in this channel.

It was by far the worst withdrawal I've gone through but after 12 days or so I started trileptal to lessen withdrawals and I think it saved me. 
I no longer take the trileptal but took it for about two months. I experienced rebound effects when I first tried to lower trileptal but after the second time I didn't. 

So I'm medication free now and I'm living as a new person. I don't act the same, I look better, I feel better. However there are a few bothersome things such as random spikes in anxiety but they're nowhere near what they were even a month ago. It's 100% manageable. 

Another problem is depression. I've become pretty depressed. No energy. Lack of motivation etc. These things tend to come and go and they're not that severe but the anhedonia gets me sometimes. Also some lack of sex drive and that's annoying but I'm assuming these things will eventually return.

So a couple years ago I started having body-wide twitches. I became fixated on life-threatening illnesses and started having massive anxiety. Through my doc and other sources, I began using .125mg of Klonopin on an ""as needed"" basis. 

EDIT: Should add that they cleared me of some major diseases during this time. 

At first this was 1x/day, but this tapered to 1x every 2-3 days as things got better.  Over the last year I've been consistently using **.125mg about 2-3x/week** to quiet early morning anxiety. 

Then 3 months ago I began developing nerve pain (tingling, ""bee stings"", sole sensitivity) in one foot. It has progressed consistently, and spread to the other foot. I've also felt the ""bee stings"" it a bit in my hands lately.

**I'll be seeing a neurologist** about this very soon, but it just occurred to me that there's a chance this could be because of the regular benzo use. 

**Is it possible to develop these kinds of symptoms from such a low dose?** 

I will be stoping K now, and hoping this solves the problem. **Also, do I need to taper?**

There wasn't much of a difference between month 6 and 8 other than I finally got my mind back.  You heard that right.  I am no longer bat shit insane. You might beg to differ, but we can agree to disagree.

Now to the important stuff.  I am not going to proclaim myself healed.  I was doing that way too early and way too often.  I feel the physical withdrawal symptoms that can be tied to BWD are long gone, though.  I jumped July 16th.  I think I had practically every BWD symptom known to humanity.  It felt like I was going insane in some alternate reality.  I could barely walk for a couple weeks and with a limp for many more.  Somehow, I didn't have a seizure.  I felt my brain and body; I was close and imagine the mixture of Gabapentin and Lamictal helped keep those at bay.  The hardcore symptoms lasted a solid 4-6 weeks, but by September I was feeling better but still very beat up.  It was mainly just sore, tired muscles and pressure headaches that lingered but it felt like much more.  My healing was very linear to a degree.  Sure, I have a 3-5 second bout of tinnitus once or twice a day, but not every day.  I have these dizzy spells when I get up too fast every great often. Could these be the last minuscule lingering symptoms of withdrawal? Maybe. It's possible, but I really don't care.  I feel great.  I honestly have not felt this wonderful, since my college years.  That's the important thing.  My body feels great and most importantly, my mind feels great.

I am not experiencing any sort of PAWS.  I am not depressed.  I am not suffering from my usual irrational anxiety and panic.  I can't believe how good I feel upstairs. I am beyond convinced long term benzo usage was slowly but surely killing my mental health and much more.  I really did lose my personality to that poison.  It was slow and subtle, but after many years that stuff adds up.  This was the most pleasant surprise of this whole nightmare.  A return of myself.  When I jumped I went manic for basically 6 months.  That added another layer of complication to this ordeal. I didn't know that was going on.  I've only just now got to feel myself again the last few weeks.

If you're reading this, please don't let my story scare you.  It's likely your withdrawals are not going to be as bad as mine or last as long.  This was not my first rodeo with a benzo detox.  If kindling is a real thing then I would have been kindled multiple times.   I jumped from 2mgs of Klonopin that I had been on for years, but my dosage had been as high as 4-6 just two years prior.  Getting off after long term use is such a liberating feeling.  I recommend to everyone.  To the people who want to be on it long term keep in mind you'll have to pay the piper some day.  It's not likely you'll always be able to score a script for the rest of your life.  When you play with fire you're going to get burned.

2021-03-13 16:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/m4fh58/propranolol/,Propranolol,"I was off benzos for about 7 months after a very long taper. On February 6th I drank a huge amount of alcohol and was thrown into some of the worst withdrawals of my life. It lasted 10 days before I finally broke down and took benzos. I used benzos for about 5 days which eliminated the shakes and anxiety, then stopped taking them. Of course much of the anxiety came right back and built over the next few days.

At this point I just couldn't take it anymore so I called my psychiatrist (which I should have done on day 1) and he told me to pop propranolol, one after the next, until I felt better. I was skeptical because I've taken prop before without impressive results. I always thought it was very mildly calming but not nearly enough to be useful. Within 3 hours of popping 60 mg, every ounce of my anxiety had completely disappeared.

Throughout my entire 21 month benzo taper he had been suggesting the propranolol and I always ignored it, thinking it was more or less placebo. Now I wonder if I had actually taken advantage of the drug could I have taken months off of my taper?

The drug is generally considered quite safe, and you can take pretty large amounts of it without ill effect. My initial error was not taking enough of it. 20 mg didn't do a thing to me. I needed at the very least 40 mg, but ideally 60 or 80. The first day I took 100 mg and the relief was indescribable.

So please at least consider trying it. Talk to your doctors about it and see what they have to say. I honestly don't know what I would have done without it.

Binge for a week during xmas because of pandemic, bored, lockdown etc... had another bad situation happen on them and went into 2021 vowing to never take again. 

I had insomnia, some joint pain, rebound anxiety, panic attacks and zero motivation to do anything productive or social. This lasted about a week, and was about 90% back to normal in two weeks.

Boom, March. The fact that i have these on me and never took then was empowering...but what do i decide to do? Dabble again. 5 days straight, but i took like 10 bars

My concern is that it’s actually tied to the Benzo use, I was heavy-ish most of my life until coming off the klonopin and losing the weight.

I’ve occasionally heard of other benzo users describing weight loss during or after taper and was wondering if anyone here has insight into this.

It happened like this..

We were sitting in the tent, we were in lawn chairs, enjoying each other's company since she only visits on the weekend, now mind you her last seizure was 3 weeks to a month ago. She turned and looked at me, we made eye contact, she dropped her jaw and fell over, and how hard she fell I knew she wasn't playing around. The tent fell on its side, poles bending, drinks spilling, I sat in a pool of beer and raspberry peace tea, comforting her and trying to calm her, her muscles moving rapidly and uncontrollably, this lasted for about 45 seconds but it felt like 2 minutes. I just kept telling her ""You're all right, you're going to be okay, I love you and I'm right here"" super gently, as I runbed her back. She came out of that stage, her next stage was gasping for air and groaning, I knew i had to do something. I ran to grab something to dose her Clonazolam with, as well as a half a pill of carbamazepine, in fear she wouldn't trust me due to deleriousness, I threw the half pill in my mouth and chewed it into chunks, and stuck it into her mouth. She spat it out. That's definitely my girlfriend, alright. She lays there for a little while and I am right next to her and I explained to her in simple terms what happened, she stumbled out of the tent by herself which I tried not to let her do but she insisted and she did, then I saw she was wobbly so I ran and tucked my head under her arm and supported her, carried her up the stairs and thru my front door. I get my room door open, brush all the stuff off and slide her into my bed. She's doing okay, I managed to get her to take some of her wet clothes off, she was tired as hell, i let her rest up somewhat while i salvage everything i can since her eyeglasses were in the tent and she couldn't really see me. I find her phone, it's wet but I got to it in time, her glasses aren't broken cause i picked them up on my way to my room, my phone which was a tad wet and has tons of cracks, was also in the same shape as before, I didn't have much to be upset about, I briefly fix up the tent not spending too much time outside.

Now she is awake and able to recognize me,(I verify she remembers her own name and birthday) and her mental state was returned to normal, or at least close to. I explained even further what happened, she admitted her last memory was being outside then she woke in my bed, and had no other recollection except for me carrying her in. This helps me prove to her, what happened moreso, as reality settles in for me what just happened I start to cry, and i do more research on responding to other people having seizures, i am pleased to read that i did 90-95% of the thing i needed to do, and did them right. I take good care of her and have her take half a pill of carbamazepine every 10 hours.

We both fear her seizing up, that's why I hope the doctor gives her carbamazepine or something more preventative, and/or a weak benzo or phenobarbital alongside it, this would help me feel at ease, and her as well. Wish us luck, she going to call the Dr tomorrow and try to get seen.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49080122}"

I’m at a point now where I feel almost no improvement month on month so feeling like I should try something different.

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.         

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

On Feb 8th I was prescribed .5mg of Clonazepam twice a day and 1mg at Night to sleep. This was due to a intense Panic/Anxiety episode that had dropped me into almost a constant state of Panic, Depression, and Suicidal thoughts for about a week(This has happened to me about 8 times in my life).

Feb 22nd I had stabilized enough to Deal with at least being alive(maybe feeling like a 4 out of 10). I also got into a Medical Cannabis program. I wrote my doctor and asked if it was safe to just drop off all these meds. She said you may want to half all the doses to .25 .25 and .5 and that would make it easier . I did that and two days later was in a pretty anxious and dark place. I was surprised that it could maybe be some withdrawal symptoms. 

I discussed that with my doctor and she said to stay on that for a week. Then drop the night to .25mg for a week.

I did just that and yesterday I decided to drop the morning dose. I am feeling a heavy anxiety through my body today. 

Should I cut down to just .25mg for next week?

Am I overthinking this?

Has this long of a taper actually just put me at risk for MORE symptoms?

If I dropped off the pills just cold turkey it would have been physically safe after 2 weeks maybe but would my mental health have sent me WAY backwards?

I asked a similar question on another benzo-related subreddit, but I had no luck with replies so I thought I’d try out here. For some quick background info, I had a pretty intense anxiety-induced breakdown back in December. I've been diagnosed with GAD since I was very young, and in recent years I had been able to keep it pretty well under control. My psych had prescribed me 0.5mg of Xanax to use as needed, which I rarely used unless I was really feeling panicked. However, after my breakdown, my psych decided to put me on Ativan instead; 0.5mg three times a day.

I stayed on this dosage for about 6 weeks. Then we decided to begin tapering. My psych advised me to eliminate one pill for a week, then another pill the next week, etc. The very next day after eliminating the first pill, I was shaking, sweating, had a horrendous headache, and basically most of the telltale usual withdrawal symptoms. I contacted him about this, and he agreed it would be better to taper by half instead of the full pills.

So now we come to last weekend, where I’d managed to get down to a singular 0.5mg pill of Ativan as of Saturday. I had been doing pretty well with the tapering process before all of this aside from the occasional headache, but something changed starting on Sunday. I started to have more increased anxiety, headaches, and awful gastrointestinal symptoms. I thought at first it might be a combo of getting my period along with the taper itself, but the physical symptoms are still lingering.

My psych has since told me that he doesn’t think that it’s actually withdrawal, and is instead just increased anxiety caused by the lower amount of Ativan in my system. I feel skeptical about this, because even when my anxiety was at its absolute worst back in the winter, I was not having issues with daily dry heaving. His suggestions so far have been to add in another SSRI (which I’m not super comfortable with because I’m already on Zoloft, and mixing 2 SSRIs together is typically not advised) or trying acupuncture. 

I don't have any experience with tapering a benzo, so I'm really not sure what could be considered ""normal"" or not. But because I had been doing well avoiding withdrawal symptoms before this, my psych was pretty confident I'd be able to get through this last hurdle fairly easily. I can't help but feel like I'm doing something wrong somehow, and I'm scared that this anxiety/sickness feeling will never go away. I'm doubting myself because of my psychiatrist’s most recent comments, because I really thought I’d pinned down what could be causing all of this misery, but he doesn’t seem to think withdrawal is even a remote possibility.

Any advice or support based on your own experiences is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much in advance, it helps to know there's a community like this out there to be able to ask questions about this to.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47795776}"

Tl:dr - I'm tapering xanax; I used to take daily 6mg comming from years of increased use. My family hates ""normal medicine"" and they just wont get my struggles. They toss off the ideia that I can have a seizure or worst. Yet they're always telling me to get my shit together (to cure my depression and panic disorder); they dont understand how much I'm trying and suffering to get off xanax. 


All of my family thinks I'm being overdramatic. They call me lazy for sleeping too much sometimes and get frustrated if I'm demonstrating emotional distress like I have a choice not to act like that.

They will say ""you did this to yourself"". My parents are people that believe in homeopathy, alternative everything, teas for healing and natural plant made medicine (sorry idk the english word for this kind of medicine). 

Im 29 and I have suffered from depression and panic attacks since I was 11. I had a bunch of the alternatives treatments my parents wanted but nothing worked. So I started to drink to feel better and that lost me some years. 

Alcohol was killing me so I quit drinking, went for the  first time to a ""real doctor"" and got myself antidepressants, topiramate and xanax. 

Long story short in 3 years I consistently took more and more xanax going from 0.5mg to 6mg a day.

Honestly 6mg was not fucking up my life very much, I could handle the memory loss and rebound depression. Until I started to have balance problems, I would lose my balance and fall. First time was when I tried to ride my bike and I just couldn't anymore. Then I fell just walking a few times. 

I'm tapering now. I lowerd 6mg to 4mg for 1 month - and this past week I went 3.5mg. Towmorrow I hope to lower to 3mg. I'm taking fluoxetin and topiramate besides that. My doctor gave me zolpiden but it makes me feel awful. 


My parents went on a big ""I told you so"" about how the meds would make me worst and they keep asking me what am I doing to get better and when I say I lowering my xanax intake they dismiss it as a non accomplishment. Makes me angry in so many ways. They don't even believe when I talk about how I suffer from WD and that should be enough for me to force myself through right now.

Agoraphobia may not be the word. I was well into this taper still fairly social. I was working out. I was taking gig work. I knew I was a little edgier, but I was still functioning extraordinarily well.

Then several months ago I caught a flu, which led to bronchitis, and that left me homebound for quite awhile. I continued to taper, but I didn't socially bounce back. Now even running an errand feels excruciating. It's like I've even forgotten how to make small talk.

I’ve always had addictive tendencies, back in high school when I’d get drunk with vodka on my own watching tv… when I would smoke cigarettes non stop in college… when I would literally be high on cannabis 24/7 for like two years… I don’t know, I’ve always just been too weak on substances.

Klonopin is my death, I’ve struggled with klonopin so many times and I always end up back where I started. The first time I got my prescription I was a teenager and would take them because they would help me sleep, then I’d take them in the morning and I’d feel better -by better, I mean less- and did that for a while until my parents took me to an addiction recovery center.

A few months ago, back in November, my adoptive brother (he is also my cousin) died from a black widow bite… It hit me very hard because he was the first person I talked to about my homosexuality and accepted me, we would get high together and I would tell him about life. Then I moved to Japan and we grew distant, then covid happened and I came back to my hometown in September… he tried to reach me and to just chat with me so many times over text but I would just neglect the messages and forget to reply, not because I didn’t want to I just forgot and kept on doing my thing (social distancing, you know) and never replied. I felt a horrible guilt, I still do - even though I am okay now, I know he’s happy and I know he’s okay now… but I am hooked on Klonopin once again and I’m scared I’ve never been this hooked on it.

I couldn’t sleep because I feel so guilty I didn’t reply to his texts and I think about him everyday… my parents noticed so they took me to a doctor that prescribed me Klonopin on early December, and I’ve been on and off with it until now (March)… I’ve been trying so hard to stay clean but I still have like two months worth of it in my drawers. I am hoping that by joining this subreddit I can slowly get back to being substance free. If anyone has any tips to deal with Klonopin abuse I’ll gladly take them. I don’t want to go to the recovery center again, and I don’t want to lose my parents trust that I’m handling medications the right way this time… I want to heal but I can’t do it alone.

To everyone in this sub, thank you for existing, and I’m sorry for sharing my story - I just felt like I needed to. I hope being here helps, and I hope everyone knows you have a friend in me.",7,"{'covid': 1, 'distancing': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46684578}"

Taking 1 mg daily but have been prescribed 4+mg for the last 9 years. Doctor hasn’t given me a solid taper plan, I’d like to start tapering asap!","I am finally able to resume my benzo taper after dealing with a number of other medical issues. I have been on various doses of klonopin for about 9 years now. Over the last couple of years I’ve been prescribed 2 mg but have managed to only take 1 mg. So I’d say my dose is 1 mg and I take it before bed so that it doesn’t interfere with my daily life as much. At this point the benzos for me are just self regulation. My body is dependent on them but they don’t do anything for me. I’m 98% sure that my body will stabilize and my anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, etc will lesson after 6+ mo off the benzos. 

When I was younger I was sent to rehab where they took me off everything I was on including a 4 mg daily dose CT.. as I was only 17, my body some how healed and I did not have any horrible WD affects besides 2 weeks of horrible insomnia, anger, rage, depression, anxiety.. but it got better within a couple of weeks. This time I’m quite a bit older, I’m not as young and resilient and rather than being only 2 years, it’s been 9 years so I am rather scared of what it could do to me, but feeling ready to resume. 

My previous doctor was terrible, she was not a psychiatrist and would give meds out like candy. My new doctor is much better and I feel that she can help me. I have reached out to her and given her my history, she is going to slowly lower my dose and wants me off this stuff. I talked to her last month feeling very anxious, as I’d just gotten off years of Gabapentin, suboxone and Kratom. I didn’t feel ready to start my benzo taper again as I’d been taking a slightly higher dose to cope with the withdrawals and panic attacks I’d been getting from getting off the other stuff. Now that all that is out of my system, my anxiety isn’t AS bad and my I’m not getting panic attacks anymore. I’m able to take 1 mg again and not take it until right before bed. 

Okay so here’s the issue, I want to start tapering asap however I talked to her recently and got a new script. I don’t see her again till next month to check in. She currently thinks I’m taking 1-2 mg every night, and doesn’t know I’ve lowered to 1 mg yet. I was thinking I could drop to .75 mg or even just alternate .75 and 1 mg for a bit? I really need a solid taper plan. She said we would do a long slow taper and I’d like to know just how slow that has to be. I’m already down to 1 mg so really how slow does it need to be?

A bit about my own Benzo Struggle and fear,"Hey guys .Firstly I’m glad I found this place. I don’t think I’ve ever made a post on Reddit before I recently found this by googling “benzo withdrawl” and I’m gonna do my best to make sense as I’m currently having a really hard time . I’ve commented on a few peoples posts . I want to start by saying it’s nice to see other people out there are going thru similar to what I am (not that I want anyone suffering not what I mean ) and also have overcome it . 
So I’m on my late 30’s (scary to even think as time flew by) and I was first put on klonapin at age 14 , when nothing else worked . It was a big deal. I could leave the house , long story short I had a lot of problems as a child . Since then Aprox 95% of the time I’ve been on 3mg of klonapin a day , legally morning , noon , and night,  ....until my script was cut off last year . It’s a long story to get into but it was unjust and wasn’t even given a taper , which doesn’t matter now but I thought I’d share that . some Pychs/doctors are ignorant or have no compassion . Mine retired and seen a new one that won’t even consider it . I maybe should add I have been diagnosed with   ptsd and bipolar 2 disorder with extreme anxiety. I’m depressed,unemployed,waiting on disability stuck in federal court , a host of other unflattering things. 
When my script was cut off last year before the pandemic hit , my brain is foggy , sometime around then, I couldn’t take the withdrawals and bought off the street from people like I was using. Drugs again which I had kicked years prior and never looked back . 
Not many know what klonapin is around here but I found several people by asking around a lot and was managing to keep the same dose for a while but those people dried up and have been sporadic and extremely unreliable so I was left having to get Xanax, something I never really took but know it’s also a benzo . In recent weeks I been rotating between klonapin and xanax down to Aprox 2mg a day and find myself feeling almost sick  with mY tolerance maybe I’ve read about and increased anxiety even while taking and I made sure the pills aren’t fake cuz when I take none oh man is it hell and I use pill if and the bottles say Walgreens usually that I see them pulled from. Anyways , 
I have had pretty good self control and I have made myself take Aprox 2mg worth a day  of what I’m used to of klonapin even while using xanax sometimes as a replacement by looking online the equivalent . Anyways it’s been hard finding lately and truthfully I’m sick of worrying about it and also I’m not wealthy it’s expensive and I’m alone . I live alone , no girlfriend anymore ,my mother is in a nursing home Ill . We are very close in an only child she always wants me to keep trying to find a new doctor or Pych. She doesn’t mean any harm but she is convinced I need to keep buying them and I told her I found. A place online and there are people out there also experiencing similar to what I am and they got off of it . My fear is how long it will take and is my damage permanent I caused by taking these and will I have another seizure. 
The one I see now says no and accused me of doctor shopping and is 82 and hard to talk to sry very hard to talk to  . I have an appointment April 1st to see a new doctor but I don’t have my hopes up as they have cracked down and don’t care I’ve been on my entire adult life . As a man it’s hard to admit this but Im Terrified and life is scary without the benzos . I Csnt even find more to do a slow taper if I wanted I was trying everyone and nobody had any that I know so I have to stop but I also am tired of worrying and want to stop since I don’t have a legal script. 
It was so simple just going to Walgreens every month for a bottle of 90 instead of relying on people who don’t care . 
Right now as we speak I’m almost out and I’m taking a half mg in morning and late afternoon  (1 mg a day now) for a few days now. 
and set to run out altogether this weekend . I wish I could sleep it off but I have obligations for part of each day.  I have had mini seizures and had to be strapped down (my neck and arms we’re moving out of control and I was awake ) and they , the ER had to inject me with a medicine called Ativan last time I went off completely which was a while ago now so I’m really scared and I can say that was terrifying and around here hospitals treat ya like a pos addict I had to sit and wait 4 hrs till the mini seizures started again then they rushed to steal me down it was just awful a true nightmare I don’t want to happen again and in afraid it might  but then I was on 3mg to 0 and I’ve rapidly gone down from 3mg to now 1mg and I don’t have enough to go slower or half mg. 
     *Will I have a seizure again ? I’m trying all I can I have zero energy I’ve aged so much in the past year my hair has thinned so I shave it my beard turning grey . I’ve gained so much weight and I have the worst pain  in my stomache and I just this morning read  someone mention “benzo belly” I’m not sure what that is Google didn’t help but what I feel is a oain like a bubble a di have to eat to get rid of it and it’s not simple like hunger . I’ve had this for years but it’s gotten worse . 
I am sorry if I am off point I dont know that I have one other than if anyone thinks I’ll be okay on my own my insurance won’t pay for long term inpatient and also I am on methadone 85mg for the past 2+ years as I had developed a bad dependency on opioids but kicked that and Csnt beileve how much harder this is personally. I should mention too that my counselor couldn’t find any place for me to detox  because I’m in methadone if I wasn’t I could have gone to a few places. she has been so nIce to me and understanding and agrees the doctor was wrong to take me off and not listen however sadly she just quit her job saying too much politics or she wouldn’t t have and I now feel super alone .  
      Have I possibly messed up my brain and body for good ? I’m 38 and I started at 14 never had a problem for years and as crazy as it sounds it wasn’t until I had already been taking klonapin for over a decade till I knew it was addicting and could be abused . I have not abused it in Aprox 2 yrs and never got any doctor a reason to think I was . The fact that I’m honest and have substance abuse history has made it impossible for me to get back on what I was taken off of and now I just want to live without if I can.
Reading you guys stories gives me hope but I’m already having heart palpitations where it feels like my heart truley hurts but I’ve read that’s part of it . I Csnt catch my breathe my anxiety and wanting to be alone is so strong in without food now and don’t know how I n go to the store I have been already missing things I should be goin to frkncwkthdrawl and I’m not even 100% off yet that’s the scary part. I hope I can make it . If anyone has any advice or can relate or any ideas they would be greatly appreciated . Also I should say I’m also prescribed welbuterin, gabapentin,clonadeen, celexa ? I haven’t even taken that yet . Would any of those help me ? I read gabapentin can also cause withdrawals I stopped taking it cuz it gave me sulfer problems but now I been reading some people like them. Sorry for rambling I tried to write this best I could I feel really crappy and foggy .

That is major bad news- if you find yourself depressed, with periods of hypoglycemia, if you are losing muscle mass and gaining fat in the middle - these are all signs of low growth hormone. Apparently it s also responsible for faster aging. Anecdotally, many people have posted on here that they seem to age faster.  This would appear to make sense as would the complaints about benzo belly . 

Some ways to increase growth hormone include fasting and exercise. From my own experience, I always feel better when I eat less and when I strain doing something physical. So I hope this helps someone else struggling.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4033989}"

I thought life was good, I'd black out for a month at a time, but always wake up with bills paid and money in the bank. However I was blind to the fact I was destroying relationships, broke my families heart, and just running away from all responsibilities. The benzos helped me avoid feeling all the negative emotions associated with life, but I failed to see I wasn't feeling any positive emotions or joy. It was hell going through detox with valium and phenobarbital in December, then went to New Jersey through the end of February, but today I can proudly say I have 73 days clean from all substances and alcohol.

Hello Everybody,

First off I would like to say It is wonderful to see others on here trying to better themselves in every way possible. I am 23 years old and will admit that I am addicted to Xanax. I first began taking Xanax in March 2020 as a way to relieve anxiety and relax. I did not have a steady supply at the time and was taking .5mg to 1mg every couple of days. I began to have access to more which began to an everyday addiction around June of 2020. I was steadily taking 2mg-4mg of Xanax per day, with some days going as high as 6mg from September 2020 to early December 2020. Once some incidents occurred I finally realized this addiction can absolutely ruin my life and have to control it. I was still taking 1-2mg per day until Beginning of January, but decreased my overall dose. (During this whole course of events as well, I would say 20% of days would be lower dosages such as .5mg-1.5mg). During this time I was exclusively taking the yellow actavis bars. Since January of 2020 I have been taking exclusively the green bars. Unsure of manufacture but 99% sure these are pharmacy grade and not pressed as I received them sealed. Within the past month, I have steady cut down to 2/3 - 1/3 a bar a day, mostly taking 1/3 just before sleep. There has been days where I have been without it as well within the last month and did not experience horrible withdrawals. I expect if I take 1/3 a bar a day and gradually go to 1/6 a bar a day with days of sobriety in between my supply will last another month or two. What am I going to expect moving forward in a situation like this? What have others expected and their results? This worries me very much and would just like to hear some personal stories of what others have gone through in a situation like this. 

Thank you in advance for sharing your stories to help others.

These dosages were also taken at night generally and not throughout the day. Get home from work and pop 2 bars and 1 before bed some days. Extremely disappointed in myself and wish I had the willpower as addiction runs rampant in my family.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49287462}"

When I was first prescribed the doctor gave me 15 .5mg pills and they would last me probably about a year. I didn’t get a prescription again for a while until last year. First covid hit then immediately into lockdown we had a huge earthquake right where I live (my first one ever) and since then my anxiety was really bad. Still I was prescribed 30 1mg and they lasted me 6 months (I break them in half and 1/4ths depending on how anxious I’m feeling or if I’m about to have a bad panic attack). I was then prescribed 30 and they lasted me about 4 months. I then got covid January 1st and my anxiety and panic attacks have never been worse. I wasn’t taking Xanax every day, but now for the past three weeks I’ve probably taken between .25 - 1 mg about 5-6 days of the week sometimes every day depending how I feel. I’m now worried I’m getting dependent on it. I’m worried about having a seizure I didn’t know that was possible until reading more into this. I feel really nauseous and just anxious af and tired and just like I want to crawl out of my skin. I’m not sure if this is still some of my covid (I had complications and just got my holter monitor off two weeks ago) or if it’s now that my body needs Xanax to feel normal. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. I just want to enjoy life again and not be afraid of everything and not feel so crappy. 💙",1,"{'covid': 3, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62641054}"

So, I've used Xanax sporadically since I was about 13 (24 now). I would take it at most once or twice a month until about Oct 2017 where it slowly became weekly. Nov-midDec 2019, slowly became near daily then quit for ~5 months and started near weekly use again. Mid-October 2020, I fell into a daily habit (not prescribed). My average dose was 1-1.5mg, usually 0.5mg a little after waking up and 0.5-1mg at night.

I tried stopping CT towards the end of December and was mostly successful for about 6 days. I was feeling better on the 5th or 6th day and started getting this odd muscle cramp in my shoulder that made me think something was really wrong (I had a feeling it was an effect of quitting the Xanax). Went to UrgentCare, was given baclofen and prednisone. Later that night, I took 0.5mg of Xanax and the cramp went away in 15 min. Didn't take it for another couple of days and, unfortunately, fell back into daily use.

Right now, I'm on the 5th day of 0.25mg 3x daily and trying to taper. I've read through the Ashton manual and it would seem like my dosages correlate with the later stages of a taper, so should I try to follow that? I'm not sure a doctor would give me Valium for a taper (I've asked about other issues and felt like they were being dismissive), so given the low dose and relatively short time of use, would volumetric dosing 3x a day with reductions every 4 to 5 days be a good regimen to follow or should I try to go a little quicker? Also, I'm guessing that the smoother and more consistent the blood concentration is, the less theres a chance of any lasting damage?

I didn't connect it at the time, but after quitting at the end of 2019, I started getting minor fasciculations randomly around my body that weren't there before. I didn't take any Xanax for 5-6 months and looking back the fasciculations went away around the same time I started taking it occasionally again.
Also, during the most recent time quitting CT, a few days in, I was on the phone and in the middle of the conversation, it felt like I blinked and jumped forward 10 sec. ahead of what the person was saying and ""came to"" feeling confused.  I've read about the spastic, grand mal seizures caused by benzo wd, but not much about petit mal seizures... any thoughts on that?",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.56663567}"
