Not a massive dose compared to some folks here, but definitely enough to seriously affect my life.

Withdrawal was awful, but shorter in duration than I expected. Maybe 2 weeks of anxious manic shakey brutality, 2 weeks of muscle issues and insomnia. 1 month total of having a lot of issues before things got noticeably better. I was taking depakote when I quit because I had to go cold turkey. 

Just wanted to let any moderate dose users know that getting off is possible. Be safe and use your head about how you get off. If you go CT, use seizure meds if you can get them.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44262627}"

I started microdosing 17 days ago with fresh truffels. 1gr to 2gr a day. This should be the equivalent of 0,1 to 0,2 grams of dried mushrooms.  
First every 4th day, then every other day, then 5 days off, and one day on.

I felt some changes right away when I started but I was not sure if it was maybe only placebo or not.  
Felt like I could enjoy music again, or watching a movie. I didn't dread doing the dishes. It felt weird to feel something positive and that made me a little bit scared. Was I tripping?

A friend of mine said for years that I should try psychedelics, just once, because he understands my deep rooted anxiety and depression. But I've always been terrified of macrodoses, so I didn't do that and I am not planning to do it.. Anyway, it was big step for me to start microdosing psylocibin.

I tried 8 or 9 different antidepressants since I was 20 (will be 35 next sunday), with no effect, but I kept taking them (still take 20mg Prozac daily) because coming off them is absolute hell.

I had to taper for 4 years from Benzodiazepines (Lorazepam (Ativan, Temesta) and Valium (Diazepam).  
No words can explain how difficult that was.  
The anger that I felt, that doctors could just make me feel worse than a heroin addict (as they say), because of a little pill that would do no damage and help me? That anger was unbearable. The symptoms too. I couldn't keep my legs still, and felt a sense of doom 24/7. Like the most intense sense of fear you could ever imagine. Puking every day. Anger outbursts. Crying. Musclespasms, GI issues, you name it I had it.

I can now say, that I am almost healed from medical-induced benzodiazepine dependency, debilitating anxiety and depression, and that microdosing has helpend me tremendously to help me see that I achieved something huge, and that I should feel proud of myself, instead of being embarrased for who I am.  
The small doses of truffels have helped me a lot more than what western medicine ever could.  
And all this whithout feeling sick, drugged, having all kinds of weird symptoms, and having to wait 6 weeks before the SSRI's would start to numb me.

This kind of ""treatment"" is not for anyone.  
It's not a magic thing that will make you better just like that, especially if you don't decide to make a change and start being aware of what you are doing, what you feel, and keeping track of it by writing down, every evening, how your day was, what insights you had, etc. First days you won't notice a lot or anything.  
Don't use this for fun. It's like therapy with yourself with some mother of nature-dust.

I can now enjoy music, like I could when I was younger.  
My sexdrive came back. I don't feel so extremely insecure anymore, and I can see my good sides instead of focusing on the bad ones.  
I FEEL ALIVE.

Thank you, mother of nature.

I hope this helps someone. I also wrote this as a reminder to myself.

90% of what I wrote is information I got before I started microdosing, but that I had to experience to believe. I now believe!

2021-12-30 13:33:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/rs8n12/gabapentin_for_help_with_xanax_withdrawals/,Gabapentin for help with Xanax withdrawals?,"I am almost 6 weeks post detox of .25 Xanax that I took once a day for 2 1/2 months. I was in perpetual state of  WD and tolerance all through my taper of 4 months, unable to get stable even with small reductions and holds. I think I was paradoxical from the start. It's so hard to believe that such a small dosage could do so much harm.

I finally had to detox to get the X out of my system so my body could begin to heal. I was only able to get down to 10% of the .25mg dosage as each time I tried to come down I was worse. I considered crossing over to valium at the time towards the end, but at such a small does of Xanax, I was afraid that I would just have the same symptoms and make the situation worse. It was a low dose but my body is super sensitive and its been a horrible experience.

Some of my side effects are  burning skin and scalp, anxiety unlike I’ve ever experienced, panic attacks, trembling, tinnitus and fear.

I’ve never had anxiety such as this, but the anxiety comes from the great discomfort of my burning scalp and skin.

My doc recently prescribed gabapentin 100mg 3x a day to help with the burning. Initially, I thought it was helping, but then there have been times where the burning was ramped up.  So my doctor increased my dosage to 200mg 3x a day, and I can take a 4th dose if needed.

I have been doing the 100 mg for a few weeks and now the 200mg for about a week. I am noticing that my burning ramps up when it gets close to the time of my next gabapentin dose.  I am very concerned that this is interdose withdrawal of the gabapetin and making things worse for my sensitive CNS.  Do you think it is interdose or do you think its just my normal burning that is seeping through, and that the gabapentin is actually helping?

I don't want to be on the gabapentin long and I dont want to stress out my CNS even more.  So, do you think the gabapentin is making things worse, or will hinder my receptors from healing? I am not sure what is best.

Some folks say to use the gabapentin because it helps clear up the glutamate storm that the CT left behind, and then others say, it will hinder my healing, because its dampening down the gaba receptors from healing, and they say the receptors wont heal as quickly and will prolong healing.

I am just trying to get relief from the burning without making things worse.

I'm so afraid that I'm not going to heal.  It's been a very difficult journey the past 7 months, and I've had the burning the entire time.  Now, that I have basically CT is it even worse. My pdoc has no knowledge of benzo, and she never warned me of the dangers of Xanax.

I don't know if I should stop taking the gabapentin, or if i should do 100mg 4 times a day, or perhaps 200mg 3x a day, or what would be the best dosage spread out.  I would rather stay on a lower dose, but not if its going to make things worse.  I am in the Acute stage right now, and it seems as if I am getting worse, and I'm wondering if the gabapentin if  making it worse for me.  My CNS is so hypersensitive due to the horrible taper and CT of Xanax.  It could be that the gabapentin is having a negative effect on me.

Perhaps I need to stop the gabapentin and just let my CNS heal without it?

I would appreciate your help.

(accidentally cold turkey),"hi so firstly to clarify i struggle a lot with different disorders and I honestly can’t tell what’s coming from what, wether I’m being over the top or not. i have been using Xanax for a few years now - albeit on and off but throughout this year it’s become daily. due to occasionally not restocking soon enough, i have at times been forced into cold turkey. 

I’ve had it said to me that that part is the hardest bit and if I just rode the wave out I’d make it out of that, and yes maybe the physical symptoms will go but I’m not sure how I can abstain without work and therapy around why - but that’s a whole another story.

my use fluctuates but it can be fairly extreme probably 12mg most days.. this has been going on for most of the year. and please know I am in works of getting help for this, i do see a drugs worker and a mental health team and they and i really want me to access rehab.

but at this point according to them, nowhere in the UK would accept me due to risks around my mental health. it baffles me there apparently is nowhere equipped for both rehabilitation and mental health risk, but hey ho. 

anyway - back to the point, if anyone could just list off what the typical withdrawal but also cold turkey symptoms  I should be aware of, what I may or what people generally tend to experience that would be really helpful so I can identify what is down to that etc.

It’s been hell, but I stayed off any Klonopin since Dec. 1st, but have continued to take my BuSpar. 

Just tonight I couldn’t take my anxiety any more and took a half a tab of Klonopin. I’m not sure if it was 0.25mg or 0.125mg. 

Either way - is this the end of the world and have I just completely undone all of my hard work trying to stay away from benzos? 

I need to increase my BuSpar back to the dose that worked for me, but last time I had daily Klonopin to help me and this time, I’m only to use it as needed - which is not helpful since I’m terrified of kindling consequences.

Weeping is very undignified for a “tough” grown man who has lost 40 lbs in last year.

Long story but I received an ultimatum from my spouse to “get help” or find somewhere else to go…she and my family think I don’t want help. I’ve showed them the Ashton Manual, letters, studies, etc., but i believe they see these detox centers and think its possible to get off quickly that way.

Since Thanksgiving I have been back on 1mg, though many days .75 (3 x .25) and once or twice 1.25 😞.  I’m afraid to taper again, not sure my mind and body can withstand another try. Plus it likely will trigger a split/divorce. I need to be semi functional (or fake it). This is my house too but feeling cognitively impaired by 6 years of prescribed benzodiazepines as well as having Parkinson’s disease, I am vulnerable. I couldn’t coordinate any kind moving ordeal. Physically or emotionally.

At the moment I have severe brain fog….I don’t believe I have dementia setting in yet but don’t know what it feels like, so…. My anxiety is painfully off the charts if i don’t take the k, but it makes me tired and wobbly. And stupid. Only a matter of time I believe before i am forced into having to do “something"" . What, I don’t know but it won’t be good.

Staying on k is unsustainable but tapering in tolerance will cause a year minimum of unbearable agony and certain divorce. Not to mention I’m likely to experience horrific PAWS due to frequent inconsistent up/down dosing and a CT (didn’t know better) for a few weeks a year ago. Whew.

Nine weeks off after using daily for five months.,"One thing I am really worried/freaking out about is the idea that I am going insane. I took benzos daily for five months, first Ativan, then Klonopin. At my peak usage I used Klonopin 1mg daily, with the most I ever took being 2mg in one day. I tapered off over the course of two months from 1mg.

It has been nine weeks now, day 64, and I still feel off. Thankfully I am not in the hell that many people in here are in (my heart goes out to you) bedridden, horrible akathisia, things like that. But I still get things like weird tremors, body tingles, and very bad waves of anxiety, depression and dissociation almost everyday. Plus I now struggle with daily suicidal thoughts and that was not something I ever dealt with prior to Klonopin.

I guess the question is how much of this is the benzos and how much is in my head? I know that is not a fair question since it is impossible to tell. But still I get scared thinking I wasn't on that long in comparison to others here and, nine weeks out after tapering, I am still feeling...off, I don't know anyway else to explain it.

In addition to coming off benzos I have also been forced to come off of using Adderrall daily (which I took for five years) because my system can no longer handle it. Anytime I take it now, even a small dose like 15mg, I have a near panic attack whereas before I would feel happy, confident and motivated. Point is, I am sure that must be contributing to an extent.

Psychiatrist passed away in 2020, primary care doc took over my Valium prescription. I noticed this month that I was out of refills so a couple weeks ago I called to make an appointment. Booked until early February, but told my doc was honoring refills as long as you have an appointment on the books. Okay, cool.

Fast forward to today, I notice the refill isn’t ready. Check my chart, notes have a random doctors name and say the request was denied. Call, find out my doc is in Egypt on vacation and the actual Grinch is filling in for her. Won’t budge. I tell them I’m out as of tomorrow morning and if I don’t have them, I WILL end up in the ER and that’s just inexcusable. 

So they eventually write me for 15 five mg Valium. I take 14 mg a day. Doc won’t be back until next Tuesday. 

So either I take them as scheduled normally and go to the ER and hope they take care of the last 4 days, or I replace my afternoon 4mg with .25 klonopin for a week. 

So instead of 5mg am, 5mg afternoon, 5mg bedtime of all Valium, I’d be doing 5mg am, .25 klonopin afternoon, and 5mg at bedtime. 

Is this dangerous? I don’t know what else to do. No urgent cares around here have doctors (all NP) and all incredibly overrun with covid patients. 

If anyone has any ideas, I’m all ears. Or if my plan will work… idk. This is so stressful and anxiety provoking and feels really unnecessary and unfair and will be super embarrassing if I have to go to the freaking ER to seek out a handful of pills.

Was wondering if anyone had any advice. Been taking 10-20mg valium in the morning, then drinking anywhere from 10-12 beers a night before taking another 10mg valium to sleep. This has been going on off and on for about 2 weeks now (some days I don't take any benzos and just drink)

The valium's prescribed for anxiety and I've been on a prescribed dose for 4 months or so now.

I'm trying to slowly taper down and was wondering if anyone had any advice. I know I'm an idiot but I'm just trying to get off this wagon while not seizing. Can't go to the docs or they'll take the benzos away and can't afford inpatient detox.

However all of the schedules are designed around people who dose their benzos 3 times a day, and I only dose once a day - 0.5mg of Xanax. I have for about 14 years roughly, and it’s been a consistent .5 daily with no change for the 14 years. Occasionally for big social events I’ll take a second dose. I don’t take any other medications, drink or use drugs.

Does anyone know if there is a place to find a suggested schedule or an example plan of switching to Valium successfully and then reducing the Valium use? 

Am I reading right that .5mg of Xanax is equivalent to 10mg of diazepam (Valium)? 

So maybe the schedule would be like:


Day 1: 0.5mg Xanax 


Day 2: 0.25mg Xanax 5 mg diazepam 


Day 3: 0.5mg Xanax 


Day 4: 0.25 mg Xanax 5 mg diazepam 


Etc etc until switched over to diazepam? Does anyone have any insight or advice?
I’m nervous to ask my doctor about diazepam use because it sounds drug seeking so I want to educate myself first. 


Some might thing .5 should be easy but 14 years of built up rebound anxiety is no joke… I’ve failed slow tapers using just alprazolam several times now.

I was used xanax for 3.5months. In the first months i used 0.5-1-1.5mg daily, but the last 1 month was chaotic, i was on 4-5-6mg daily. Yeah I abused them. Also i abused stimulants and alcohol at the same time with the benzos, so my tolerance is fucked up. Last week i switched xanax to kpins because i want to taper off. Also i stopped using coke and alcohol. 
But all of this, my bzo addiction was the disaster, because of the xanax’s short acting time, i was anxious all day.
Mentioned i switched to kpins, i feel better now, but i struggling with falling asleep, and my sleep quality is not very good, but at least i dont get really anxious all day. I take 2mg kpins once a day in the evening before sleeping. But i want to slowly taper off and forgot benzos. 
Can you help me with a taper plan and how can i improve my sleep quality? I take melatonin also before sleep, but i had  insomnia in all time of my life, before benzos too. And this is why i started to take xanax, it kicked me out and i could sleep well. (but honestly it was so good for the daily stimulant binge too)

In need of hope - when does it get better?,"I’m almost 6 weeks post detox of .25 Xanax that I took for 2 1/2 months. I was in perpetual WD and tolerance all through my taper of 4 months, unable to get stable even with small reductions and holds. 

I think I was paradoxical from the start. Finally had to detox to get the X out of my system so my body could begin to heal. It was a low dose but my body is super sensitive. 

Some of my side effects are the same that I endured during my attempted taper: burning skin and scalp, anxiety unlike I’ve ever experienced, panic attacks, trembling, tinnitus and fear. 
I’ve never had anxiety such as this, but the anxiety comes from the great discomfort of my burning scalp and skin.  I’d take any other symptom as a trade. 

The past 3 nights I have been awakened by massive cortisol surges that go through my whole body. It feels like acid going through my veins with continuous hot flashes of heat which then causes my burning skin symptoms to ramp up all over.  It’s painful and so distressing. Then comes the panic and trembling.

I haven’t had these surges before and my burning skin sensations are not getting any better. I’m loosing sleep with the cortisol surges, and am only getting about 3 hours of sleep. 
Before these surges started happening, I was getting decent sleep off and on. 

Why would these hot flashes of cortisol start happening now when I’ve never had them before?

I’m so discouraged and wonder if something else is going on. Why would I be getting worse? 

I was in great pain last week and went to ER. They did CAT scan, blood work, EKG, and all were good. 

I really wonder if my nervous system is just getting worse or if my nerves are just too damaged.  I’m broken hearted that I haven’t healed and appear to be getting worse. 

My doc gave me some gabapentin 100mg 3x per day, and I requested propranolol .5mg twice a day. I will pick it up today. Don’t know if I will take these. 

My doc is clueless about what to do. She said my withdrawals should be done and said maybe I need a neurologist. So that frightened me. She has no Benzo knowledge other than to hand it out like candy. She never warned me of the dangers. I have had to tell her about the Ashton Manual after she had me cut too much at the start of my taper. I never stabilized. 

I’ve been battling for so long through my taper and now in Acute. I am feeling despair because I’m not healing. I really don’t know how much more I can endure. I need hope that I will heal. 

I realize the detox (basically a CT) is causing the issues, but I had the same thing all during tapering, except the surges are new and my tinnitus has decided to ramp up as well. 

My worst symptom is the burning in my brain/scalp. It’s like hot lava being poured on my head. 

I suppose my gaba receptors being awakened and my hypersensitive nerves that were suppressed by the Benzo are trying to heal.

This is all just pure torment from the pit of hell and is wearing me down mentally. 

I meditate, pray, read scriptures, watch YouTube videos of healing and Claire Weekes books on anxiety. 

Please, has anyone had it as bad in Acute? I truly need endurance and hope. Maybe I’m just one of the unlucky ones that doesn’t heal?  😥

I was hoping that I would heal in time for Christmas, yet sadly,  I will now be spending it alone.  

Does anyone else have these massive surges of cortisol hot flashes and symptoms? 

If any of you are the praying type, I would appreciate and cover your prayers for me.
Lord help us. 🙏

Also thank you to everyone who has encouraged me the past weeks. My friends think this is all in my head and that my symptoms are not real.

I had been on 2mg of the oh-so-potent clonazepam for 2 years before starting a gradual taper, guided by the Ashton Manual. After a brutal six months, I decided to transition to diazepam per the manual’s recommendation. I have since gone from the equivalent of 40mg diazepam to just 0.5mg today. 

The transition from 0.75 to 0.5 has been more soul crushing than I could imagine. Days pass where I just don’t care about work, bills, eating, life. Starting this during COVID and quarantine probably made things even tougher. Thankfully I have a few better days each month where I feel I have a brain again. 

I am worried about the final steps to 0.25mg and then zero. I know that it all depends on your own biology and it will vary. But I’m so exhausted and the idea that things *could get even harder* once I hit zero makes me feel so empty.

Dopamine is used to decide what’s rewarding and how you want to attain it. It’s also used to decide whether something is threatening. Felger explains that these reward circuit regions may not interact as well with each other in people with anhedonia. And therefore, this weakened communication between regions suggests unbalanced levels of dopamine, says Tiffany Ho, PhD, a cognitive neuroscientist and assistant professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at UC San Francisco.


Ho also nods to the possible role that prolonged brain and body inflammation—which is often observed in someone with depression and anhedonia after experiencing stressful events—can play in setting the stage for less interactive reward circuit regions.

Adding to this is the amplification of the brain’s threat circuit, which scans for things to avoid.  “Now that we have so many fearful and emotional things going on in the world, the brain is responding more and more to threats and less and less to things that are rewarding, just based on what we're exposed to,” Felger says. The reward circuit and threat circuit are constantly running in our brain, she adds, but when one is used more and takes up more brain energy, the other ends up running less efficiently.

I don't know why I relapsed back into this hell but hey, we're not perfect. Anyway, over the course of just under 5 weeks I went through about 40mg Clonazepam. Some days Id take 2mg, and other days I'd go 2-3 days without any. I was going to quit the week of the 13th and was on my 3rd day off again when I got into an accident and needed one to relax because I was so shook. My last official dose was last tuesday morning at 7am (nov 14th). I'll admit that since Saturday I've felt spaced, headaches, very anxious especially in the morning, and overall fuzzy if that even makes sense, with this overall sense of dread. I have 8 1mg Clonazepam left, and I'm wondering if tapering would even help since its been a week, just over, since my last dose. Should I stick it out or maybe try a quick taper? Thanks for all your help guys it means a lot right now.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5183007}"

I realized when I quit both cold turkey benzos are way harder. 
 So 4 psychward visits, 1 rehab stay, numerous doctors and psychiatrist, all refuse to help me because my medical records from this damn doctor who terminated me. I have had a year clean, and just 6 months clean this year. I try but cannot function without benzos, I isolate and withdraw never gets any easier. So when it comes time to work I just can't help but to relapse for the interview and then stay on them to work. It truly does help me as I am holding down a good job and got into free community college... here's the catch, I was substituting vodka for benzos earlier this year.(terrible idea do not try it!), And got a DUI which am ashamed  of. First one so I got fines, classes, and probation. Scared that I fail for benzos and go to jail to get clean or what I am trying now, a rapid taper, will cause me to not be able to work finish school. I need to pay fines and really want to have a career and take this opportunity of free HVAC with internship and career finally at 33. Just scared once I hit the week Totally off I'll get the same tremors,shakes,brain fog I always do. And coincidentally lose job, unable to pay fines, and mess up school, it means a lot to me...

I reduced to 0.5mg over 2 months with no problems and further reduced to 0.25mg over the next few months and stuck with that. I bounced back up to 0.50mg 2 days ago due to an event and then another event happened right after which led me to 1mg again today.

Should I skip my nightly 0.25mg dose for a few days to even things out or just take it (making it 1.25mg total for today)? I was planning on reducing down to 0.125 in a few weeks. Are these two increases likely to hit me within the next 14 days if I don't skip doses?

Even if the hit is minor in terms of agitation or nausea and such, I have a pain condition where the slightest increase in anxiety or muscle tension makes it worse. So really trying to do this in the smartest/most gentle way possible to avoid the pain.

edit:Sorry, I should have clarified. I was not experiencing anxiety or withdrawal symptoms at the time I updosed recently. Only pain from something unrelated to clonazepam (my condition is sensitivity to sounds, I had two loud sound incidents in two days that caused pain.).

I use clonazepam as an off-label muscle relaxant because I've had problems with regular muscle relaxants and my heart. Clonazepam relaxes the tiny ear muscles in my ear so if I think I've suffered a ""setback"" with this condition (pain hyperacusis/middle ear myoclonus), I take clonazepam so the muscle can relax before it starts doing more damage (long story, difficult to explain to people unfamiliar with [these conditions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2331216518801725)).

But anxiety from tapering off in the past has caused the same type of pain because it also tenses these dysfunctional muscles. So I'm trying to taper off and avoid that anxiety as well.

I'm worried about reinstating back on to 0.50mg for longer if my body wasn't really experiencing withdrawal symptoms at 0.25mg. I understand if someone updoses simply because they can't handle withdrawal symptoms and are withdrawing, but in my case I was completely comfortable when I took both updoses, other than the pain in my ears from the sound I was just exposed to. I just don't want these 2 updoses to screw me over within 14 days with increased anxiety. I don't know if updosing just two times (while having no anxiety before the updose) can result in this.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4970003}"

This is going to sound crazy but I need to get it off my chest and I can only tell strangers bc my family doesn’t know about my Xanax dependence!

I am a 32 year old female located in TN have a toddler and recently left her father moving back in with my family. I am in recovery and have been clean from opiates since 2015 when I went to rehab.

I am a hair dresser and work 4 11 hour days Thursday-Saturday 9am-8pm. I used to live 15 minutes from work but moving in with my family put me an hour and 10 minute drive to work. 

Between the stress of the commute, the job itself with over booking clients due to my old salon closing and having to go to a new salon with poor scheduling procedures, my 2 year old not sleeping through the night several days in a row, daily struggles , and working in an atmosphere where 2 older woman are prescribed (sold and abused) I became dependent on xanax.

From May 2020 (coming back to work after the pandemic mandated us to close down) I was unable to process the stress of overbooking and began buy her whole a rope and talking 3 2mg xanax daily.

I knew I was in trouble by inter-dose withdrawal and how sick I was when I tried to skip a day. I tried everything from April 2021 to August 21!!!! Tapering, Comfort meds, blood pressure pills while withdrawing, suboxone, some of them were effective but the withdrawal is so long term I would chronically relapse.

Late August I was driving to work (I never took it before I arrived so I was clear headed) and I was only seven minutes in my 70 minute commute on the bypass in my small town. At a yellow light a semi suddenly got in the right lane without any warning and slammed on his brakes causing me to slam to the back of a 18 wheeler. 

Luckily I don’t remember a thing until the Covid test at the hospital. I had an aorta transaction (stent)  due to my main artery splitting in half on impact, A full hip replacement due to three pelvic fractures, A broken tibia and fibula, A fractured calcaneus which is the bone in your heel. 

I had three surgeries and 21 injuries, but they stabilized and medicated me through the whole 11 day visit. They thought my fluctuating blood pressure was due to the trauma from the accident and treated me accordingly keeping me somewhat comfortable and highly medicated on opioids due to all of my surgeries. 

I’m on a long road to recovery but I have not touched a benzo since and I refuse to ever again.

Was able to see see my doc yesterday and explain what was going on. For those of you who didn't read my first post ill link it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/rfii0n/is\_this\_withdrawal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/rfii0n/is_this_withdrawal/)

Took the 1 MG last night right after I got it, and slept through the whole night for the first time in a week. Woke up this morning though and I'm very shaky. I'm assuming that its going to be normal with a few other things.

Doc said he wants me on 1MG this month until I can see him next. I feel like I can do that since I was using 1MG and it seemed to be working right up until I ran out. The biggest thing I'm concerned about is work. I just know I'm going to want to take more when I have to go, because that place stresses me out, and through all of this they've been hounding because I haven't been able to come in. Only started this job 2 weeks ago. I would quit, but my brother (who I am living with) doesn't understand what I'm going through and believes that this is just in my head and if I do enough I'll just be fine. I got a new job already, but it doesn't start until the end of January. I asked my brother if he would be okay with me just waiting until then, but he said no. I am stressing going it so badly. Yesterday they asked if I could come in early, and I told them no. They then told me that I have no choice and that I will come in early. I don't know what to do.  

I'm sorry for this being a little jumbled, my brain is still feeling pretty fried. If you have questions let me know and Ill be happy to respond. Just looking for a little advice from someone who's had to work through this and see how it may effect me.

Please help.,"I recently detoxed from .25mg of Xanax almost 5 weeks ago. I have had horrible burning skin as a side effect of the Xanax withdrawals. I had it all the my taper and was in perpetual tolerance WD so I decided to detox so my body could heal.
I took the X for 2 months and tried to taper for 4 months. It’s been horrific! 

My doc prescribed Gabapentin to help with the burning skin sensations. I’ve taken 100mg 3x a day for a week. (She said I could take 200mg 3x a day if needed)

I noticed when I first started taking it that it took the edge of just a bit, but lately it seems like the burning is ramping up. It mostly happens after I’ve been sleeping. 

Today I took a nap and woke up and my body was on fire. Each morning when I get out of bed it does the same thing. The adrenaline surge burns thorough my veins like hot lava. My body feels like it’s on fire. 

I don’t know if it’s due to the gabapentin or just a wave from the Xanax withdrawals. I’ve not had it this severe in a long time. And it seems to be happening since I started the gabapentin. 
I’m just so sensitive to meds. 

So I’m wondering if the gabapentin is making this worse for me and ramping up my side effects from Xanax withdrawals (burning skin) as more of the medicine is getting in my system now? I also have a metallic taste in my mouth. 

I was so hoping this gabapentin would help me but now I’m concerned that it’s making it worse. 

I don’t want to stay on the gabapentin very long because I’ve read the horror stories. I was just hoping it would help me with Xanax withdrawal burning skin symptoms. 

Maybe I’m taking too much? 

I did start trying to take Omega 3, Benfotiamine and Zinc, so maybe it’s too much for my CNS?
(I stopped all supplements during my taper and thought I would try to take these again) maybe the supplements got my body ramped up? 

I also used some Himalayan salt today and am now super thirsty.

I’m so scared! I’m so feel so ill. 

It’s so distressing! Please help me. 😩

Also can I just stop the gabapentin cold turkey if I’ve only been taking it for a week?

My prescription now is 6mg but I have maybe thirty 10mg pills laying around...

Don't know what I'm asking really. Do you think I can cut back to 8mg later? Anyone else that started taking more during covid? I started microdosing psilocybin (see my other thread) and it has been good. But felt pretty bad taking it now. My hope is that when I'm not sick from covid that I can start with psilocybin again and go back to a lower dose of diazepam.

Wth am I supposed to do? I never felt so bad physically ever in my life and that makes me feel worse mentally. I was supposed to have Christmas dinner tomorrow with friends and a big party after... That was my only plan for Christmas. So that makes me sad as well. Even if I take a 10mg pill it just makes my anxiety a little bit more manageable but I still feel like shit.

Long story short, I was ready to go back on the Klonopin to the 1/8 because I was depleted and sick and in agony. Nothing left to fight with after four months of trauma and anxiety and loss of 50 pounds. Everyone around me was on board since it was obvious I had hit a wall. I resigned myself to it and did the zoom with the Dr. at the addiction center. They fit me in when I called frantic. It is so amazing the have the support of this system. Its restored my faith. Anyway I explained everything and she looked at me in thought and said No. I cant in good conscience do that knowing how badly you don't want to be on it. Here is what we are going to try.  She has prescribed low dose Depakote for a week to give me a break from the anxiety and to hopefully allow normal sleep ( normal for me anyway.) Low dose clonidine for a week to help with the anxiety and a short acting muscle relaxer for two days to help with the body pain and tension. I was super not happy with the idea of taking more meds but to be straight with you all, If I didn't do something I was going to crawl under a bush and die. I am just sooooo fucking thrilled I do not have to back track and do this hell all over again. NO RESET and NO DO OVER. GOD what a rush.

Almost 7 months ago I finished my taper. I was taking 2-3mg of Ativan for over 4 years. Everything was manageable until I jumped and then withdraw turned my life upside down. 

I went thru quite a lot of nasty symptoms and I didn’t really know what was happening. I didn’t know about benzo withdraw and this sub made me feel like I wasn’t alone. 

For many months I was completely hopeless. Day after day I suffered. Even though many nice people on this sub told me it would get better I never believed them. I spoke to people every single day just to get by. Every single day was hell and I was convinced my life was over. I did not see a way out. 

I’m not over withdraw but I finally see the light and an end to this. The harder I worked at exercise, diet, staying busy, exposure, meditation, and prayer the better things got. There were times I couldn’t do anything. Other times I had to work thru the discomfort and pain. I can say that exercise has been the most helpful in my experience. 

My parents were vital to my recovery. Without them I would not still be going.

Before that it had been 2 weeks. 

Before THAT I had taken about 6 doses in 11 days or so. 

Could me being in anxious Hell (high pulse - like resting pulse at 80+, exercise is harder) be because of the Klonopin? Or is it likely the Zoloft?

I also wake up frequently at night. At least every 2-3 hours. So I worry I’m damaging myself that way. 

I have seen almost no improvement w the Zoloft. But I know that is at least safer than benzos by far (I am VERY wary of benzos but I needed relief last night). I will taper the Zoloft if/when I do come off.

Finally got up at 9, and started the frenzied re-packing so my crew and 7 other immediate family members could spend 2 lawless hours driving to a lake house, where we’ll be joined by another  13 members of my extended fam who literally just happened to be in the neighborhood for my very nontraditional animal sanctuary/lakeside wedding tomorrow.

I also woke up early this morning with this overall feeling of darkness and despair. Also semi racing thoughts. A pretty scary experience. 

If you are going through a benzo withdrawal, it may be good to use caution when taking pain killers. Thankfully im not in much pain anymore and its manageable, so I can just easily discontinue. 

If you were to look at any resources to see if opiates can cause issues after such a short time, you wouldnt find anything. But if you're going through a plethora of mental health issues, I think anything that messes with the balance of your brains neurotransmitters can be risky.

Minutes seem like hours. I took my second dose (1 mg twice a day) about 6 hours early because I couldn't handle it. I wasn't even shaking or vomiting or having seizures, but just a taste of that anxiety I've been avoiding so long. My heart is with those really struggling.

I'm not allowing myself to dose until 12 hours since my last dose. I have 4 hours to go and it's midnight right now. No way I'm sleeping. I took mirtazapine and 30 mg melatonin and it did jack fuckall.

I've been taking 2 mg of clam for about a year, with some flualp and flubromazolam and flubromazapam thrown in. I was prescribed klonopin for about a year before I started self medicating. When you have anxiety disorder self medicating makes a lot of sense. 

2 months ago, I told my doctor what I've been doing. This was probably a mistake 

The psych dr I was referred to (after waiting a month for an appointment) was was initially enthusiastic about getting me back on a prescribed benzo I can taper off of... until he talked to his boss. Neither of them have ever heard of clonazolam and it scared them off. I was just a liability to them.

 He basically said there's no equivalency and referred me to the psych hospital. I went there and they made it clear I was there to DETOX. They wanted me to quit cold turkey. At this point I had maybe 10 days of clam left and lost my patience. I told the triage nurse I didn't think they were competent to treat benzo withdrawal and left.

So I went back to a different doctor. The place junkies and psychotics go. I lied and said I've been taking 4 mg of ""street"" klonopin. He said there's no way in hell he'd give me that much, and I understand. I'm happy to get the script I got, Although he's not perfect I'm not going near the Wellbutrin he prescribed me (he didn't believe me that it gave me speedy side effects in the past. In fact he was shocked, despite the insert listing that as a side effect. He said it's very unlikely i'd have side effects to ssris, snris, and wellbutrin, but in my opinion I've only experienced side effects from those drugs). 

Also he gave me a shitload of hydroxyzine which I used to abuse with DXM. If i take more than 50 mg of benedryl in a day it makes me hallucinate, let alone hydroxyzine. I tried it out today and it gave me tinnitus and I saw little ants crawling in the sandwich I was eating.. that's when I redosed my klonopin. Well he prescribed 100 mg hydroxyzine every 4 hours as needed... They rely on me not  knowing what an anticholinergic is. Or that wellbutrin is a substituted amphetamine. Or that trazadone metabolizes into MCPP. Oh well he can't be perfect I'm just happy to get a script it feels like a new start.

My doctor has no idea about my taper, and in a recent appointment, Propanolol came up as an “addition” but I plan to keep the propranolol in case of an panic emergency. Is this cheating? Is it effective? Is it simply uneceaaary because all these physical symptoms need to be experienced sober to heal properly?

I started taking sertraline (zoloft) a week into my taper and for a couple of weeks had some days of severe anxiety/ feeling panicky.

My anxiety has now subsided and baseline is way lower than it was before I started taking clonazepam which I think is down to the SSRI.

I just seem to have a slight tremor now which I've had since about a month after I'd started taking the benzos anyway. I'm hoping this will improve with time?

The FDA has released very specific language that ending benzodiazepines requires a taper due to,” physical dependence,” at risk of seizure.” 

This is good information for doctors. I always show doctors the newest information. They do not look at it, but they do have to follow this or it is malpractice. 

I called the FDA when I found out I couldn’t stop taking clonazepam. They have a MedWatch program I’m sure millions have contacted. 
 

“Physical dependence can occur when benzodiazepines are taken steadily for several days to weeks. Patients who have been taking a benzodiazepine for weeks or months can have withdrawal signs and symptoms when the medicine is discontinued abruptly or continued in lower doses to avoid withdrawal. Stopping benzodiazepines abruptly or reducing the dosage too quickly can result in acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Prior to stopping benzodiazepines, patients should talk to their health care provider to develop a plan for slowly tapering the medication.

In addition to requiring an update to the Boxed Warning, the FDA is requiring other changes to the Warnings and Precautions, Drug Abuse and Dependence and Patient Counseling Information sections of the prescribing information for all benzodiazepine products. The agency is also requiring revisions to the existing patient Medication Guides for these medicines to help educate patients and caregivers about these risks.”

I took it daily for almost 10 years until I had a very bad incident with Phenibut which ended up with me being put on Klonopin. I took the Klonopin daily for five months and tapered off.

I was feeling like absolute hell for a while but was starting to feel better save for depression and lack of motivation. So, stupidly, I began taking 30mg of Adderall once again to help me focus. At first I was fine, even feeling better. After taking it daily for about 10 days or so though I noticed I began feeling extremely anxious and gross. Last night I had a horrible anxiety attack mixed with some of the worst depression I ever experienced.

I threw the Adderall pills away but I feel like I have set myself back considerably in the WD after this BS. Today I've been anxious as hell, so bad I feel like crawling out of my skin, severe depression (felt like crying all day), hopelessness/sense of dooom, feeling like I am going to die, sucidal thoughts constantly. I know this is WD from both the Adderall and benzo but my question is how far did I set myself back? I have just felt like crying and freaking out all day. I can't stop thinking about suicide.

One thing is for sure, I am 100% done with all drugs after this. I have to accept the ugly conclusion that I can no longer take any sort of strong stimulant like I used to.

A wise new friend on here suggested smoothies to get me through the lack of eating so I did that today to take the medicine. I have had nausea but my BP is back up and that bodes well for hydration. 

I had two zoom calls today with the Addiction center outpatient folks to see if they could help me mitigate the withdrawals and give me support through the process. The psychiatrist was wonderful but only sees me being a clinical case at most for 2 months as I'm not a addiction issue but a physical dependence issue. I'm going to look into support groups specific to Benzos and see what I can find. She offered kava kava tea as a possible no medical addition to ameliorate the symptoms some. She also offered Valproic Acid  which is a mood stabilizer and may show some effectiveness at reducing symptoms because it settles the GABA receptors. Not habit forming and at low doses, can be stopped at will. HOWEVER, it carries liver issues and GASTRIC UPSET as side effects. I think I am cursed to go through this with an ulcer.

I told him about all my withdrawal symptoms and he, again,  told me that going as slow as I was (4 months) there is NO WAY I'm having withdrawal symptoms.

I've been on 2mg klonopin for 5 years now. I told him that I was having physical withdrawal side effects of my brain not having the gaba it's used to and he said ""It's all in your head. Your physical symptoms are being manifested by your fears surrounding letting go of this drug.""

I am not addicted to this drug. I am chemically dependent on this drug by no fault of my own because when it was prescribed to me I was not told ANY of the side effects of the medication. It was prescribed for insomnia. 

I told him that it's been scientifically proven that people not only can die from going off a benzo too quickly but that suicidal ideation is also a real threat that IS NOT psychological. It's literally our brains trying to re-establish normality. 

He said ""You're wrong. It's all psychological."" Now I don't doubt there is some psychological side effect of being taken off a drug that your body has become dependent on, but to flat out DENY that there is a neurological, physical, and physiological side effect is beyond irresponsible and is utterly reprehensible and abhorrent. 

He told me he didn't understand why I needed him to believe me. 0\_o   I told him because you're my doctor. You're supposed to care and at least be open to what I'm telling you. If you don't believe me, then research it. Prove me wrong. You are in the ""caring"" profession! How can I build rapport and trust with you if you don't believe anything I'm saying?

Needless to say, I fired him and am looking for a new psychiatrist that will work with me. My point of this post is to not scare anyone or bring them down but to reassure them that you're not crazy. It's not all ""in your head"" and only psychological. There are REAL physical and physiological side effects from going off of these drugs.

This past summer I suffered from Gastritis and it was rather traumatizing. I lost 32lbs to which I've yet to regain. I was barely able to hold my job, and it really took a toll on my marriage. I've been prescribed 1mg xanax as needed for the last 7 1/2 years. I would mostly only take .5mg a couple times a weeks, sometimes more, sometimes less. But because of this illness, I was taking .5mg in the afternoon, and .5mg to bed for about 2-3 weeks. Also the Xanax made my gastritis feel better, so I would treat myself to 1 mg on like a friday night or something and hit my delta 8 pen.  

Because I couldn't drink, I was at least happy I could still hit my delta 8 pen. Well, I had tried a really low dose Delta 8 Tincture, and it caused a panic attack to which I needed to take 1.5mg in order to calm down. What I didnt realize was that this was not a normal panic attack, and actually and OCD attack. I had never been diagnosed with OCD before, and im not really getting into whether or not THC can cause OCD because TBH I dont really know if it does. 

Anyway, through July and August I would take my Xanax here and there, being carful not to overdo it because of the 2-3 week period I had June/July taking it every day. 

Well around mid August, the intrusive thoughts started coming back and I really thought it was due to the stomach meds I was taking, so I discontinued. I felt better for about a week only for the intrusive thoughts to return. 

I then started getting this really weird feeling in my head that I couldn't explain, it was constant, and almost like an electricity kind of feeling. Almost like my brain just took a couple of shots of espresso through an IV or something but more intense. This feeling was almost like I was going crazy. after about a week, it turned into more intrusive thoughts. This was accompanies by crying almost every day, bad anxiety, and insomnia. 

&#x200B;

If you've read this far I know this is getting long so I'll try to summarize from here. 

&#x200B;

I would notice that taking .5mg xanax sometimes would clear these symptoms up completely, and sometimes it was only half effective. Eventually I started to feel better, so after a day or two I would take .5mg at night because I really wanted to sleep well after the insomnia. A couple of days later, the feeling would come back and progressively get worse, then a few days later the intrusive thoughts would return, then I would start to feel better, and the cvycle would repeat because I would take another xanax. 

&#x200B;

On NOV 7th, I took my last xanax and kind of put the pieces together, and the weird feelings and other assorted symptoms did not return. 

ONE WEEK LATER, I developed Tinnitus and I've had it since. 

The past week however...the intrusive thoughts/OCD have returned, but only one theme. Previously there was a lot of SI and Harm OCD, now its mostly another theme which I would rather not get in to. 

The weird feeling in my head has not returned, I'm mostly sleeping better. But this one OCD theme is so disturbing to me and I thought I was done with it. 

If you've made it to here...thank you. What do you think? Think this is from the 2-3 week period I took the Xanax twice a day, on top of intermittent use for 7 years? Or is my brain just f\*cked....?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5063009}"

It wasn’t worse than any of my previous cuts, so I’m taking that as a sign to do the same thing again. I’m planning on cutting to .5 tomorrow and really hoping I can keep going down by .125 every 10-14 days until I’m off. Has anyone tapered similarly? TIA.

I used benzos daily for 6 months with growing dose, about 6-8mgs of Alprazolam per day. Went through the hell of benzo withdrawals and survived. By far the worst period of my life.

About three weeks ago, I started having problems with my gf, who is also a recovering drug addict. She suddenly started drinking again and we had started drifting apart. She had started to reconnect with her old drug addict friends.

I became really stressed about the situation that I was losing her to drugs, so to calm my nerves and to be able to sleep at night I bought a couple of Ksalols(same as Xanax, alprazolam 1mg). Makes sense right, here we go again! I picked her up and brought her home a couple of times from those friends, and soon I found myself drinking there as well. This one dude offered me more alprazolam for free for some reason. While drunk it seemed like a good idea to take them.

My dose went up in days. I had to take 2mg, then 3mg just to fall as sleep and cope with the stress. I ran out of the pills fast and bought some more. 

After two weeks of taking 1-3mg alprazolam daily I ""woke up"" and realized what was happening. I cut all contact to her. I took my last 1mg of alprazolam 2 days ago, and havent been able to sleep since. I'm going through the same withdrawal hell I already went through a year ago. Not as intense but still, I recognize this feeling. I cannot sleep or relax, my anxiety levels are through the roof, muscles feel sore and shaky. All this after just two weeks of use.

I am an anxious person, always have been. 13 years ago I got a job that was super stressful. I was in tears every day, stopping to throw up on the side of the highway home. I went to my Dr and she put me on sertraline. Fast forward 13 years. Pandemic, lost my mom, had to handle the estate, sold a house, bought a house and moved. For whatever reason I told my Dr that I was in a good place and wanted to come off the sertraline. She's like, fine, you are low dose, 50 mg, take Half for two weeks and quit. I did. Got the brain zaps but otherwise ok. Fast forward 5 months. I had a panic attack on a plane and had to get off before they pushed back and that began my decent into hell. I was  still seeing my primary and she put me back on the sertraline. Anxiety was through the roof, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, thought I was losing my mind. I went in and they put me on hydroxyzine but a few days of that and I was a mess still. Went back and they offered Klonopin 1.5mg with half three times a day. Amazing! I'm back better than before! then I realize I need to get off so begin to taper. I was supposed to see my primary soon so I went ahead and tapered down too fast. Rebound!!! tinnitus though the roof, massive weight loss a total shit show. I begged her to put me back on and she did but at 3/4 of a mg with .25 in the am and .5 in the evening. I made an appt with a psychiatrist and that took a month. so now 2-3 months on and off total with highest dose 1.5mg. I've taken Ambien 6.25 for many years for a sleep disorder BTW. Had to take the evening dose of Klonopin 6 hrs in front of that and still slept like a baby. Saw the psychiatrist finally and we began a weaning regimen cutting down a 1/4 every two weeks with the last quarter being the evening or 5pm dose. I had a week at a 1/4 with the end coming up and asked if the second week I could cut that in half to 1/8. a bit imprecise but workable. Doc says yeah. we planned that I'd take hydroxicine if I had any withdrawal and forged ahead. I'm now at the end of week two of HORRIBLE withdrawals and I'm holding on by my fingernails to not turn back. I have not slept more than 4 hours a night for two weeks and without Ambien I wouldn't have gotten that. I have mild COPD and had a recent sleep study to determine if I had apnea. I didn't but my O2 dropped at night. So now I'm waking up frantic my heart pounding and I don't know if it's withdrawal or O2. it abates and I try to doze off just to wake up moments later. I'm nauseated and unable to eat. The tinnitus is SUPER loud but meditation is helping to rehabituate me to acertain degree. I'm possibly going to qualify for supplimental O2 at night so I can relax about dying in my sleep. But that is a week out. My question and need is this. I desperately do not want to go back on the Klonopin. The withdrawal is pretty freaking awful but I'm two weeks in. Last dose on November 28th. How long can it last at this level and should I stick it out? I had the weight to lose but I'm weak and depleted, trying to make myself eat is rough. 50 pds is not insignificant and on the Klonopin I had my appetite. Can I do this and will it end? The tinnitus is super anxiety inducing but of course doesn't bother me when I'm calm or meditating. Please tell me I can do this!

Up to probably 8-9MGs a week. In November finally get insurance and I'm able to see the the doctor. Refills Ativan and puts me on antibiotics for cough saying lungs sound tight.

Due to my current predicament, and lack of sleep, he suggested increasing the Mirta dose to 30mg. However, I feel like I’m in this mess because I’ve just been doing what doctors told me to do. You guys seem more knowledgeable than a lot of doctors, so I’m wondering what you think. Aren’t higher doses usually more activating? I’m confused.

i've been taking zolpidem since i don't even remember when exactly. i know it was this year, but i can't pinpoint an exact date. maybe around may or june? just a simple psychiatrist visit, complaining about heavy insomnia and extreme anxiety about a future university admission exam. left with my usual stuff (sertraline, ritalin) and a sample box of nuit flash, a brazilian brand name for sublingual zolpidem. flesh-coloured pills with a liminally sweet taste that make everything feel like a liminal space. my dream candy.

it started off okay, using it to sleep in the more chaotic night, nothing out of the ordinary. then, i found out about its recreative potential, and that's basically when shit hit the fan.

it was august, and my relationship with my  ex-girlfriend was getting even worse because i would stay up until late more often than i wish, high and rambling on twitter in pure gibberish. at this point i used the highest amounts ever, up to 10mg at a time + 10mg redosed (sublingual pills start at 5mg), which made me 
then september came, and shit got really hard. i created a private twitter account for my nightly rants but didn't tell her, just invited some friends and closer mutuals. we broke up recently at that point, so what's the point? but i still loved her. then she found out about it, and things got rough. like, absurdly rough. fighting, suicide threats from her side, my saviour complex being tortured and all that good stuff. in the end, we settled down and i deactivated the account because i didn't want her to see the mess i had become.

after that, usage dropped. or at least usage while on social media dropped. then i started to use it while watching porn and reading erotica, because if zolpidem does 2 things they're making me a complete mess and horny as an animal in heat. twice as depressing, if i ought to say. jerked off high and didn't remember the next morning.

oh, i also forgot a really important point: my doctor gave me 2 prescriptions and discount coupons for different brand names of zolpidem, also sublingual, and i had around 60 pills by mid-september. one of them was wonderful at first, tasting like minty cherry. plus, i started taking pregabalin (75mg) daily.

october kicks in, i can't remember shit from this month with my ex because she blocked on telegram in november, which erases chat history for both and has messed my recollection of events for the most part od this year. sad moment. i was just taking pills and not remembering it properly the next day, at least without posting shit online. 

november was tough. i had the infamous test later that month, a low stock of zolpidem, some pregabalin and sleep to have. and, for the Gods, i found the magic combo that made me actually sleep in a few minutes.

and now it's december. just a fucking mess of a month, in which i'm trying to decide once and for all if i should go back to my ex or just forget her and also trying to weaponize my pills to make me a productivity beast. i'm tired, man. i'm just really fucking tired. it was fun at first, but now i have some tolerance and too much to do and i need to regulate my sleep schedule and not abuse this thing and also get that girl out of my life because i don't really love her anymore. she's even more mentally ill than i am, her family is a complete hell, she's too clingy and insecure and jealous, and it's all online. pathetic, i know. and i also know i'm being a bit selfish, but i don't care anymore. it's been almost 2 years and she didn't even try to change for good. i'm not her saviour, her messiah, her jehovah. also, minty cherry just hurts.

sorry for going off-topic.

i'm just exhausted of losing my life to a girl who's not worth it anymore and a pill that isn't that fun anymore. but i have to pick a not-so-fun-anymore thing to keep, and i will pick the pill. at least i can use it to become the productivity monster of my dreams.

also, i never imagined i would get addicted to it. not even to the drug itself, because i never properly remember what happens after i take it, but rather to this wonderful ability to forget and sleep. i'm an addict, just a white kid stuck in a bad relationship with a girl and a drug. i'm addicted to that bad love.

i'm tired. i'm sick and tired and i deserve better than this shitshow. i will recover. i can do this.

but for now, i will just use the weapon that was killing me as a way to kill the world and make me a wonder to witness.

i will probably delete this post tomorrow. it's something, i guess. and i also wrote this whole thing while high after opening telegram to check an information to add to my daily planner and messaging my ex some random shit so she doesn't freak out tomorrow after seeing my last seen. dude what the actual fuck i'm doing with my life.

Looking for insight.,"Here is a more detailed picture of what has been going on but I will also leave current cliffs below and small summary at the bottom. [https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/p73j6d/suffering\_severe\_withdrawal\_symptoms\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/p73j6d/suffering_severe_withdrawal_symptoms_from/)

**Cliffs:**

* Have severe anxiety with panic attacks and some agoraphobia and vertigo
* Was prescribed Klonpin by a psych. 0.5mg PRN for about 4 years. Have also tried most SSRIs and SNRIs with little success, Klonopin seemed to be the only thing that really helped.
* I tried to limit intake due to tolerance and dependance potential. Used on average 3-4x a week. Appx 7.5mg/month. No other drugs used and very minimal drinking during this time
* This past year my anxiety and related issues seemed worse and klonopin didn't seem to work as well anymore. I never tried upping the dose, but I'm sure it had to do with tolerance setting in. I decided to try and quit to see how I would feel. I had heard some people recover from their anxiety all together after quitting so I wanted to try.
* October 6th was the last day I took Klonopin (had a panic attack that day) and decided to quit cold turkey the next day. This was my 4th attempt at cold turkey quitting in the recent past. Previous record was 25 days. Tapering was not an option at the moment as I was out and my Dr was leaving the practice and seemed to lack concern over this. Said my dose was low enough that I shouldn't suffer withdrawal...but was he wrong
* The withdrawal has been horrible, all the stuff you read about. Insomnia, brain fog, no energy, lack of balance, vision issues, agoraphobia, panic attacks etc etc etc. Most medical journals and articles say the worst of these should be done within 4-6 weeks, but unfortunately I am still suffering all of the above 9.5 weeks later.
* I realize I took klonopin for a prolonged period of time, but I also never took particularly high doses. Has anyone else here encountered similar time frames with longer term lower dose use? I have barely left my house in the last 2 months and it doesn't feel like I'm any better off.

\*\*\*\*As a big caveat to all of the above, the current ""withdrawal"" symptoms I'm suffering are VERY similar to how I felt when I first developed anxiety about 8 years ago, just a bit more intense. That was prior to ever taking any medication, so those were obviously not drug related, hence my quotations. Is it possible this is just how I feel? It's incredibly frustrating that Benzos have been the only thing to help me, when they are regarded as so bad for long term use, but when I take them I feel so normal. Like how I remember myself feeling before any of this was an issue. I'm sharper, alert, more active, social etc.  They seem to have kind of the opposite effect of the stereotype of Benzos. Has anyone else experienced this as well? Is it possible I should just continue to take them? My new Dr has prescribed them to me, but I haven't taken them again as I'm already this far along... but after explaining what I've detailed here he seemed to just write me off as well. \*\*\*\*

**Big Questions:**

So I guess I'm just looking for insight into people timelines with recovery, especially if they were on similar dosage to me... and also if anyone experienced what I have with Benzos being the only medication that seemed to help (or if you have suffered similar issues, what other meds did help) and how they almost had a more stimulant like effect...Also is it possible I should just start to take them again as prescribed? This isn't me looking for a justification to take them, if I wanted to I would... I'm just curious if some people really do just do better just taking low dose benzos for severe anxiety and related issues. I've read some studies that do seem to indicate it is a thing, but then I also see all the stuff about long term use so I'm torn on that.

For the first 6 weeks I took between .125mg and .25mg clonazepam at night. I was switched to Lorazepam because clonazepam took too long be active when I was panicking each night. I have been taking .5mg lorazepam for about the past two weeks almost daily due to daily panic attacks. U don't feel addicted or like I crave it at all, I literally take the lowest prescribed dose and only during a panic attack, and I know that is currently daily because I have panic disorder. I know you are not supposed to stop cold turkey, but do you really have to taper if you have been on the lowest dose for less than 2 months? Also if I did go cold turkey is there a risk of seizures at this low of a dose? Or would it just be increased anxiety. I really don't think I'm addicted but the horror stories of addiction on here and the idea of having a seizure if I stop terrifies me, I think I'm mostly taking them out of the fear that I will somehow have horrible withdrawls.

After reading all the horror stories, I was terrified of starting my taper. My work is pretty intense and emotionally exhausting, so I really could not afford the withdrawals.

When my doctor took an unplanned vacation and left me without a refill for about a week, I was forced to go down to 2 a day to make it through. When my refills was finally approved, I impulsively decided now was the time to start the taper. It’s already been a week so why not just keep going?

I’m happy to say that my first month of 2mg a day ends on Tuesday, and the results have been surprisingly easy! I noticed having some bouts of anxiety during the day, and some days of insomnia, but overall, a lot better than expected! 

It’s been very difficult to find any doctor around here that would help with the taper, and the one I currently see is very convinced of a quick taper (.5 mg every week). So I’ve been doing my own while keeping my same prescription. 

Once I hit Tuesday, I plan on trying 1.5 a day. I know that is considered an significant decrease, but my body seemed to handle the 1mg decrease pretty well, so I’m just going to go for it!

I never had a strong urge to take any (I was prescribed 1mg kpin a day) and was always so scared of getting addicted that I never took them more than 2 or 3 days a week. I didn’t really even enjoy them that much they just helped with chronic anxiety and migraines (The majority of benzos work wonders on migraines for me) It’s a real thing, mainly because of their anxiolytic and muscle relaxant properties. I enjoyed taking them every once in awhile to put me in a better mood and not have to worry about getting a migraine (I had migraines nearly daily)

Anyways, it got to the point after 3 or 4 years where I still wasn’t “addicted”, but I would get very anxious thinking about the possibility of my doc taking away my script (I’m sure we’ve all had that feeling) and would get so relieved when my script went through. I was also getting more severe and frequent migraines. They were basically an every day occurrence now.!benzos were basically the only daily meds that were still working. I wish I would’ve just asked her for a higher dose, and good chance that would’ve solved the problem, but I had been contemplating buying RC benzos for several months. I knew it was a bad idea and I was bound to get addicted, but I was so tired of my migraines and feeling like I didn’t have enough benzos to keep myself from feeling like shit.

So basically the rest is history, my tolerance grew faster than I ever thought was possible, and now idk exactly what my tolerance is (I mostly just take RC’s. But if I had to guess I could take 20-30mg Xanax a day and seem mostly normal. 

Anyways, today is my first official day of tapering. I’ve tried going to docs but they’ve all told me my tolerance is way too high for them to prescribe me what I would need. So now I’m starting where I started with RC’s which is diclazepam (for those of you who don’t know it’s almost identical to Diazepam and great for tapering). I know I can do it, I NEED to do it. I spend several hundred dollars a month on RC benzos that I barely have the money for, and my wife is tired of always seeing me messed up, barely to walk, and basically be my personal nurse (she monitors my medication).

Ive been on daily xanax since I was 13 and I’m 28 now. I was started on 0.5 daily and am now at 3 mg daily (also been on all manner of SSRIs and ofc been to therapy but nothing helped like xanax) and, despite initial relief, my anxiety has only gotten worse the more xanax I’ve been on. Ive been feeling like I lost/am losing my mind for so long, my brain atrophying more and more, totally emotionally numb and dissociated unless I’m in the throes of a panic attack that feels like near death. I haven’t felt like I have a brain or that I occupy my body in years. There’s a perpetual fog over everything and when it sometimes lifts my senses and nervous system become so overwhelmed that I panic. I feel either dead or on the verge of death constantly. I cant leave my house or be left alone bc of the anxiety. I have no friends/relationships outside of my mom (I don’t even seek them out bc I can’t leave my house due to the agoraphobia) and Im mostly bed bound. I feel totally out of control of my body and life. 

This sub has helped me realize I’m not going insane and there’s nothing physically wrong w me; I’m experiencing the harsh psychological and physical reality of severe benzo dependence. I always knew I was dependent but I justified it as treatment and didn’t see how it was negatively affecting me until more recently as the dose has increased (last 2 years).

I don’t know where to go from here. I know what I should do, but I don’t know what I can do. My anxiety is the worst it’s ever been and I don’t know how much more I can put my body through when even on this dose it already feels like I’m in constant withdrawal. The panic attacks are so severe that I sometimes faint from the tachycardia. I cant differentiate when something is actually physically wrong with me versus psychosomatic anxiety symptoms. This is all further complicated by chronic illnesses (autoimmune disease, hypothyroidism, dysautonomia) for which I’m on several other meds for. 

I’m so terrified of everything and this constant stress (as well as the stress of going into actual withdrawal if I were to start tapering - I’ve also tried valium and always have a horrible reaction to it that I know isnt in my head bc my mom, who has also been on xanax for anxiety her whole life lol, also experiences this reaction to valium, so feasibly idk how I’d taper with it) isn’t good for my already compromised health. So I feel fucked either way. I wonder if I’m just in too deep at this point and if it’s not worth the pain and toll it would take to try to taper (but then again that could just be my dependence talking). I know I eventually want to but I tell myself I will ‘when I’m doing better’ but..what if I never feel better enough to even try?

Thienobenzodiazepine,"I’ve been on 10mg Olanzapine for about 10 months now. I didn’t realize it was (is it?) a benzo until a few months ago. Initially it took care of drug-induced psychosis and it worked so well for my anxiety they kept me on it. But now I am 100% dependent on it for sleep and I am terrified of withdrawals. I’ve also had a semi-benzo problem in that I’ve relapsed on alcohol countless times and been prescribed either Librium or Valium for up to 2 week tapers. I realized last time I relapsed almost 2 months ago that part of my withdrawal is probably actually kindling from the benzos as well. So I’ve been on and off Valium and Librium basically every two months for a year, it’s been 50 days or so since last Valium. 

I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction to get off olanzapine when I’m ready. I’m moving back in with family so will have time and a safe space to taper, but I’d like to do so with as little withdrawal as possible.

I’ve gotten off a 3 year suboxone script and as I mentioned above quit alcohol (with extreme kindling to point of seizures) multiple times. This gives me a little confidence but im still quite scared of what may come when I wean off this crap.

He believes that it helps with sleep along with cannabis.  This podcast helped me to understand how sleep interacts with substances. Xanax, thc, alcohol, Ambien, etc all help you to move into an unconscious state but they don’t allow you to realize the benefits of REM which is needed to help the brain reset. Without it you’ll have higher anxiety. So by taking these substances it actually makes your symptoms worse. 

I want to share this with him but he doesn’t want to hear advice from his parent. Hopefully it may help one of you to fight harder to end your dependence on this awful drug.

I’m 32 and never had an issue before, and the first OCD attack happened when I took a delta 8 tincture. I recently had a couple of weeks with no ocd symptoms and thought it was gone and just due to WD, but now it’s back and I’m not sure.

However, I can hardly focus on anything anymore. I feel like I have taken some kind of drugs. I have derealization and depersonalization. It really feels very trippy. Sounds and lights are kind of amplified.

Was experiencing anxiety and depression while on it and had nights where I would wake up every day at 5 am with severe anxiety.  I didn't realize that it could be the xanax that was causing the issues.  

I started tapering and went down to 0.125mg (1/2 pill) and started to feel better.  At day 6, I felt pretty good and was able to sleep for most of the night.   I tried to stop for 2 days but experienced a relapse of anxiety so I resume dosing at 0.0625mg (1/4 pill) at night.  For about 4 days, I was okay and was able to sleep for 4 to 6 hours with some mild anxiety during the day probably due to interdose withdrawal.

But yesterday was bad, I had a stressful day at work and had a bad anxiety episode.  I could not sleep last night even with melatonin and benadryl 75 mg.

I was going on retreats in the Amazon Rainforest in 2015, 2016 and 2017. My doctor knew of the strict diet I was on to prepare my body and that was that. He said nothing and looked forward to hearing of my experiences there.

I had zero withdrawals. None. Zip.

However, when I prepared to go in 2019, it was hell on earth.

Doctors at the ER had NO idea what was happening to me. I didn't either. As an aside, I did make it back to my jungle home in 2019 after 2.5 weeks of terror. 

Life went on and I went back on this ""wonder"" drug that actually gave me energy.

Don't forget, I was still in hormonal imbalance. Progesterone depletion plays a big role in this - benzos and progesterone both work on Gaba A.


Now I know benzos are dangerous. I didn't know about interdose withdrawal.

Now, I do. I learned last year. My doctor certainly didn't teach me.

My point is that every single body is different. The body changes. The drug changes (I suspect) perhaps.

Didn't help at all going cold turkey, I stayed clean 6 months and had to get a job so relapsed sadly on street Benz.

Also just today I passed my placement testing for HVAC college classes :) so I have been doing very good. I try to watch my use and slowly taper myself because no doctor or psychiatrist I see will put me back on benzos or even give me a taper.

A little background I'm (18 M) living in a really small town in the MIDWEST. I've had a lot of problems with my mental health mostly anxiety, depression, and I think some kind of borderline depression (not diagnosed). I had 9 months clean since February but decided to relapse mid November last month while on a work trip. I lost everything after a week of that. Shows how much damage people places things do in just 7 days I lost 5 grand, bunch of drugs and possessions, two jobs, and went homeless very quickly.  Left right off where I was at when I started my journey.. I decided to admit myself into the hospital and left a few hours later.  my mom picked me up and took me to an inpatient the next day I went in terrible condition. My heartbeat was at 50 bpm, my blood pressure was at 85/? And I was all beat up, cold, starving and it was shit.

I got out of inpatient last week I was there for 6 days (not my first rodeo.) I felt really comfortable there it was a good break and distraction from what was going on. I thought for sure I'd get out with some money, my job would be FOR SURE given back and I'd get back to my project, and I'd have some bars. But nope. None of those things of course!! I went back to my old room at my Ma's it was torn to shit. Piles of trash and clothes everywhere. Checked my bank account I'm 300 under. Old text.. ruined all of my relationships.. called my boss and manager no answer.. got a text back though and the answer was no. The feelings of depression were terrible rightfully so. 

The problem I face today is I have NO money, I have so many bills. I have no job no license no car. I don't live close to anywhere to ask for rides from friends or family. I was used to riding my bike 3 miles in the snow but I lost that job. And there's no other places in the area. Stuck in a super rural area. My probation officer is on my ass even though she was the first person I called to tell her I relapsed and was going to get help! She told me today to cancel my plans to go drop and get upcharged for the rapid test an extra 5$ from the last time smh.. my parents want me gone and are gas lighting me and I'm trying to find a way out of this. Yes I fucked up.  I wanted to have fun, relax, get shit done.. sue me.. now God is trying to bend me over and fuck me! 

So where do I go next?? I have no money and no way to make money. I can't sleep at night and it's hard to even get through the day at this point. I've been to sober living previously for 7 months where I got most of my clean time but they won't let me back and it cost an arm and a leg and they always are strict about working. Definitely not for me. I don't want to be clean I never really wanted to. I've been miserable through this whole processes. If I had something to live for maybe it wouldn't be so bad but I'm really stuck. I'm trying to get to 1-3 12 meetings meetings a week and fit in 1 zoom meeting. I have one my class to finish to graduate for my senior high school year. I'm trying to do the right thing and it seems as if the whole court system and work situation in the US is a scam! Pure evil.

Used that for about 2 years. My memories from that time are practically indecipherable. A mess of images and events and places without any linear or temporal cohesion. A complete blur. Many things happened. I traveled the world several times. I got engaged. All pretty much gone. 

Also got addicted to fentanyl.

Summer 2020 decided to get clean. Kicked fentanyl and was so sick that in desperation I popped like 40mg of clon and alp, which caused a massive rebound type withdrawal experience that lasted 5 weeks. All of the typical acute symptoms. Total terror. Was still taking 2mg clon/day, hoping that it would level me out. Total nightmare hell world that I thought would never end. Got worse and worse for 3-4 weeks...

After 5 -7 weeks I finally stabilized at 2mg. At that point I began to slowly taper, and from that time - around September 2020 I began cutting like .25/month. 

Made it to June without much suffering...

June 2020, relapsed on fentanyl and decided to finally go to treatment. Entered treatment at .5mg clon/day. 

42 days in treatment and rapid tapered from .5/day to .125/day by the time I left.

August dropped to .0675/day. Pain free. Felt stable and jumped to nothing 3 weeks ago. Totally terrified that I’d have to go thru some form of acute again. To my amazement ZERO withdrawal except for a little restless sleep, decreased appetite, and occasional heightened anxiety, but nothing extreme.

I’m now almost a month free and feeling better than ever. I thought I’d never be able to get off but here I am. Benzo free and no withdrawal.


For everyone out there going thru it: hold on and go slow! It is possible to get off these drugs! Take your time and listen to your body.

I'm not really sure if it's even allowed to post here when you are on z-drugs, but I guess I'll try. If this is relevant I'm 26M and healthy.

Basically, until about a year and a half ago, I relied heavily on weed to supress my anxiety and sleep problems, but due to having cardiophobia, I started to have panic attacks when I was smoking so I completly stopped (I've been sober for a year and four months). A short time after stopping I went through some hardships and I've basically had 2 hours nights which wasn't enough for me to function during the day.

So I went to the doctor and he prescribed me 7.5mg/day Imovane **for 2 years** to help me sleep and *oh my god* do they help. For months I could finally get the quality sleep that I've been craving.

But about 6 months ago I realized something weird:  during day-time, I kinda get dizzy. One time it got so bad that it triggered a panic attack and had to go to the ER because I thought I was dying of an heart attack.

After going to the ER, I went to see my doc because, well, I don't want to ever live though that again, so he prescribed me Ativan ! When I feel the anxiety creeping in I take 0.25mg and it helps but now I'm on one benzo and another non-benzo and I think it's fucking me up. During the day I'm so anxious I've secluded myself from the outside world in fear of having one of those panic attacks again. And when I do go out, I always bring my Ativan with me in case something happens.

The daytime dizziness I'm half-sure is related to Imovane mixed with anxiety. I was so afraid it was my heart I did an ECG and everything is good. I've been tappering of to 3.75mg but it's still very hard for me to go down to 1.875 without having a sleepless night.

I would really like to stop taking Imovane, I think being it on for a year and a half is too much. Did anyone else here have dealt with this before? I'd like to know.

I’ve been on it for about ten years. It’s a slow, thankless process, but I’m proud of myself and I want to take a moment to celebrate! Even in May/ June of this year, I could have never imagined that I would be ok taking this small of a dose. 

I wish I had known about tapering years ago. I hope doctors will start learning and talking to their patients about it. I think I had it in the back of my mind many years ago that I didn’t want to be on benzos forever, but getting off seemed goddamn impossible, so I wouldn’t even entertain the idea. If only I had known how doable it is when you go slowly. Oh well. Better late than never :) I am going to focus on the future and not my regrets of not stopping sooner.

I’ve had a myriad of side effects, but overall they have not been debilitating for me as long as I’ve tapered slowly. I’m not out of the woods yet, of course, but my taper is scheduled to end in January! :) I hope that my story can give someone a little boost of hope & confidence in their tapering journey. <3",21,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.75515497}"

Well guess what, I've actually started to feel better when I got off from it.  

Same thing with mirtazapine now, I'm finding my brain to work much better as I'm tapering it down. It's a sneaky med though, as right after taking it it gives you that impression that you feel calmer - but not long after that comes brain fog which can easily drag into the next day (it's an evening med). 

My point being, sometimes it's counterintuitive to think that you'll get off of them once you feel 'okay'. Since the more you actually heal, the more certain side effects from them can appear, which makes it quite easy to mistake them for actual withdrawal symptoms.

It says on google that lyrica can be used long term without tolerance growing for anxiety, but I remember reading the same analysis about gabapentin which is definitely
Not true as I have read others who grew tolerant to gabaP’s anti anxiety effect rly fast as well. So I’m curious if anyone here has experience with lyrica working long term for their anxiety or if like gabapentin the effects drop off rather fast in which case I wouldn’t even wanna start it as it’s just not worth a few weeks of relief to me if it’s not a long term option.

I’ll keep this brief:

Went to a medical detox to kick the last .25-.50mg’s of xanex…. I know it’s not much but doc suggested medical detox based on the longevity of my use (6 years.)

Somehow the NP in charge miscommunicated the amount I was taking at intake…. This is a new facility and the operational aspect wasn’t great. Long story short, I was placed on a taper schedule of 15mg of Valium daily (5mg x 3.)

I knew this taper was too high and tried telling the staff this for two days. I was a completely zombie. I finally spoke with the owner who spoke with the NP and psychiatrist who admitted ‘we may have started you at too high of a dose,’ but never gave an admission this was likely based on a usage of 2.5, rather than 2.5. Very apologetic but not one really owned up to what happened. 

They immediately pulled me off this dosage and took me to 7.5mg daily for one day, then down to 5 mg for 2 days. The next day, day 6, they took me off Valium completely and said I was medically safe to go home. The kicker is they sent me home with 90 gabapinten and FORTY FIVE 5mg of Valium. 

Am I insane for thinking this taper is not sound?

To start, I’ve been on 1.5mg per day (0.5 3x a day) of klonopin since 2017 for generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder- which was a misdiagnosis, I actually have borderline personality disorder, depression, and anxiety.

I moved and saw a new doctor in November. She wanted me to go from 0.5 3x a day to 2x a day. I begged her to PLEASE adjust my seroquel to stabilize my suicidal thoughts, and then we can work on a taper plan.

She refused. So, I started tapering. I went from 1.5-> 1.25mg for 2 weeks and starting yesterday I dropped to 1.0mg. Needless to say I’ve been angry all day today.

I had an assessment with a new psych doctor via telehealth today, and we’re on the same page about misdiagnoses & we have a taper plan. She agrees that how I’m tapering is too fast.

HOWEVER: she cannot prescribe controlled substances. She asked me to explain the situation to my primary care doctor and I’m waiting on a call back to see if they will refill the klonopin. 

I have a refill for 0.5 2x a day but as stated that’s too fast. The prescribing doctor won’t listen to me and my insurance won’t cover all of these assessments with other doctors.

Anyway i didn’t went to my psychiatrist for about a year because i didn’t advance with him, but motivated by my recent progress i booked a session.

Today I just came back from my psychiatrist, i explained to him what i did, my tapering, the fact that posting here helps me, i told him i was still on diazepam, that i had to up the dosage he gave me. 
i saw he was not happy i went to see my classic doctor for my diazepam but i won’t go on a seizure session again for doctor good behavior point.
I can get real diazepam without doctors if needed , i won’t blame myself for trying to save myself. 

He acknowledged the progress but maybe he don’t realize my situation. I told him quitting etizolam AND diazepam wasn’t possible simultaneously, and that’s why i didn’t saw him a lot this year.

He liked my « going foward » spirit but ended almost forgetting i was on diazepam , i had to told him wait wait my script.
I tought he understood i still need my diazepam script , i was happy of the therapy until this moment like, did you even listened to me ? That i had to up the dose you set ? And you reduce the dose i told i had to up ? 

Honestly what i learned this year is that you, I, have to change in order for things to change so i know i’m going to make it , but f*** like, i went for encouragement and « keep going » type of things and i felt like i wasn’t listened or understood at the end, almost like a punishment with this reduced script.

Unfortunately, I also found out that a lot of her recreational drug habits are a bit deeper than recreational, and she struggles intensely with clonazolam addiction. Before I knew her, she had tried to quit for months and just wasn’t able to. 

Recently, she tapered off for around a month, had a shit day, finished what was left, and hoped to whatever chemical jesus exists that she wouldn’t seize. Luckily, she didn’t. 

A few weeks after that, I was with her when she found a bottle she’d hidden while blacked out. I asked if I could throw it away, got permission, and did so. A few more blackout bottles have shown up since and she threw those away as well. 

Since, she’s been having a really hard time not buying more, and often talks about how much she wishes she had some and how much she regrets tossing everything. 

So here’s the part where I need advice:

I want to be supportive in helping her move through the next few months of intense psychological withdrawal/cravings without being obnoxious or a dick. What would the perfect withdrawal support buddy look like for you? What are some helpful reminders for this time?

I’m pretty familiar with addiction in general both personally and with others, I’m just not sure exactly how benzo addiction feels. I’ve tried to be somewhat stern and no bs about it, but also empathetic. Idk, I just wanna help.

The last two years of tapering and post jump have been hard. Not only because of the withdrawals but because doctors don't know anything about withdrawals. I have a psychiatrist who happily let me taper at my own pace, but I could tell they were skeptical that what I was experiencing was really withdrawal symptoms. So I just didn't really bring it up much. Instead of trying to convince them I just juggled and adjusted my medications and supplements as I thought necessary. I'm glad to be where I'm at 5 months post jump but I just don't want to try to be my own psychiatrist anymore. 

I had waves in weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 17. I haven't had a wave in 8 weeks so I'm in the clear in that regard. In my waves I had intense akithesia, head pressure, depression, anxiety,stomach problems, etc. But since my waves ended Ive been experiencing waves of depression that have been set off by being alone after dark. I get very depressed, start sweating, cant concentrate, lightheaded, etc. I also have anhedonia, which is also a reason why I'm getting depressed lately. I obsess about when I will feel joy and love for my family again all day every day. Then again anhedonia is a SYMPTOM of depression is it not? Anyways I was diagnosed with bipolar 13 years ago but it's been reversed by other doctors. I've never experienced depression that was this deep before, so I don't know what to think.

I’m in the process of reducing and having a very hard time. I can’t tell whether it’s with all withdrawals or if it’s because my original anxiety is still there. My psych prescribed 1mg clonazepam to help with sleep, severe anxiety/agitation and get used to an antidepressant (Escitalopram). But I have missed the “deadline” (2-3 weeks) and it has now been closer to 3 months. I reduced to 0.5mg gradually over the last 3 weeks and i can feel that all the original symptoms are returning and (in some ways worse). 
I don’t know what to do; stay put longer, until the AD will start working better (not a given) or continue with the taper and risk the symptoms getting completely out of control. 
My psych wants me to be “comfortable” and said I can go up a little and take time reducing…but I worry about tolerance withdrawals if I stay too long.
Problem is, deep down I feel NOTHING will work against the kind of agitation and anxiety I have been having except something that works with GABA receptors. This really means panics me.

Ps: just to add that I have a friend who has been taking Temazepam and Xanax for sleep for 15+ years and hasn’t developed any tolerance. I wonder maybe those pills don’t do anything for him, he just doesn’t know it and it’s a placebo effect.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7454704}"

I had used Xanax for many years prior. The withdrawal was fucking awful, of course. Dry heaves, delirious panic, etc. I frankly never really improved to where I could get to sleep very well, but I did eventually get to a point where my sleep is mostly normal if I eat Benadryl. Anxiety is basically always high, but that’s life I guess. CBT, exercise, proper nutrition, and TRT has helped a lot.

Anyway, three months ago I got covid and it seemingly amplified all the neurological symptoms of anxiety I live with. It was bad and I told my doctor as much. He wrote me for Lorazepam, 3mg/day. For the last three months, like an idiot, I’ve taken 1mg at bed time to get to sleep. The first thing I noticed right of the bat is mild closed-eye visual disturbances and weird hypnagogic experience such as the sensation of electrical pulses in my brain/body and slight hallucination.

About a month ago I began experiencing eye and muscle twitching and low grade headaches all day along with slightly blurred vision and extreme brain foginess. One week ago I reduced from 1mg to 0.5mg nightly, and intend to taper that again to 0.25mg in a week or so.

So my question is this: I’ve been down this withdrawal road before but I don’t remember much of it (I don’t remember much of those years of my life tbh). I’m a hypochondriac (and probably slightly ocd) and I’m starting to obsess over the following symptoms:

* Leg twitching
* Eye twitching
* Ear ringing
* Blurry vision (at times)
* Headaches

Some of this is actually slightly better since reducing my dose, but I’m beginning to obsess over having ALS or MS or something. I could just use a sanity check on this stuff from someone. Given my past use of Xanax @ 4mg I didn’t think Ativan @ 1mg would be this bad. I mean I’m not dry heaving like I was when I quit Xanax but still.
