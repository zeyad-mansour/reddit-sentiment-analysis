But for these past few days.. I sleep for about 6 hours 7 hours interrupted. But i feel sluggish. Compare to klonopin. It doesnt make me feel sluggish after wake up. But im afraid of tje side effects. Ive been taking klonopin for about 2 weeks straight and 2 month on and off.. And then i decided to stop because of the horror story that spike my anxiety and decided to switch on mirtazapine which ive only been on 3 days but damn i feel horrible. So ive got appointment in the upcoming 1 weeks. So which one to decide? Damn man.,1

Yesterday, I drove an hour to see a psychiatrist I had been waiting 3 months to see. Every other psych around me has a 4-5 months waiting list. When I made the appointment I let the secretary know I was looking for a psychiatrist to help me taper off long term benzo use (10 years) and my dosage so the doctor already had this information. When I got into his office he proceeded to tear me down for an hour, telling me I’m an addict, I don’t have my priorities straight because I wanted to do a slow taper instead of medical detox, I’m obviously a “pro” at finding Xanax on the street so why should he trust me”, telling me I obviously didn’t do my research about rehab and detox when he didn’t even know what the Ashton Manual was. While I do understand from his perspective that I am not to be trusted as I have been buying off the street (not always, I have been prescribed multiple times) and I am on a high dose (4mg a day, tapered down by myself from 6mg) he already knew why I was there so I don’t understand why he even wasted my time. I work two jobs and and am working on my master’s degree and can not afford to take the time off of work and school. He told me he was a not a good fit for me, he hoped that I get the help that I need, encouraged me to keep tapering myself off from Xanax off the street and that his next patient was there and I needed to leave. I was already crying in his office and walked out to a room full of people awkwardly staring at me, turned in my half finished paperwork and left.",74

It wasn’t enough for me to even notice though.  I went through withdrawal in 2018 but didn’t really know about withdrawal then. I ran out of my medication on vacation and went back on but on a smaller dose (1mg of Klonopin to .5mg.) 2018 is also when I first started having eye/vision issues. I was given a glasses prescription for very mild astigmatism along with being mildly nearsighted.

So she ate this medicine for 1 month, on an off and on basis.
Two weeks ago, she has been telling me that she wants to get rid of relying on medications too much to help her with sleep and anxiety. So she tried to quit for a week, and she described it as ""Living Hell"", with dizziness and sleepless nights. She told me she doesn't understand why she feels that way for some reason. 

So today...I found out that my mom has been taking Clonazepam with 0.5 mg of dosage daily. I went to look up on it and was shocked by all the withdrawal symptoms. 


She went to look up on it herself too and saw horror stories of how people have to take this for their lives, or how people never recovered.

Why is this kind of fucking drug allowed to be imported? For money? 

So right now as my mom's child, I'm really lost, I don't know how to help my mom, is she gonna be alright from quitting this with the doses she took? Seeing her suffer really pains me to see. Are there any tips I can get to help my mom to recover?",6

I bought some of this stuff finally. I struggled with some benzo use a while ago but managed to quit. I only have some temazepam left for 'emergencies'. The downside of temazepam for me is the rebound anxiety - i HATE it.


On this subreddit i read about dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine. I gave of a shot and it3 works pretty wel!

So... what is actually the difference? I have 50mg dimenhydrinate pills and 25mg diphenhydramine. Are they equally potent? I take 2 or 3 to sleep. I am not combining them.

Can i build a tolerance or become dependant3, and if yes, how fast?

How much would i have to use to experience withdrawal symptoms when i quit?

More than a year back I came into a situation where I had near unlimited supplies of benzos.

I started of taking Xanax from time to time, and not knowing **anything** about the true dangers of these drugs I soon ended up taking it daily.

I upped my dosage continually until I was taking about 5mg per day. I knew for sure this couldn’t be good for me, but again I had no idea just how bad it was. “I mean don’t they prescribe this to people who can’t sleep, or people with anxiety, old people etc”

Then I read an article about someone addicted to **prescribed** benzos and how they had to taper for a year and they still had issues months after giving up.


This lead me down a painful rabbit hole where I learned as much as I could on what I had done to myself and what I needed to do.


I immediately started the Ashton tapering method. The move to diazepam was surprisingly easy. 100mg a day. 

From there I dropped my dose fairly close to the guide, sometime stopping on a dose for longer due to drinking alcohol (stupid I know).


Now I’m down to 65mg a day.


The issue is that I no longer have a supply of diazepam. I know I could get it some other ways, I know people who do. But this would put me in risk of going to court, and having a record.


So I’m thinking my only option is to visit a doctor. But I’m wondering how much they know, I fear they will tell me to taper much faster.


**Does anyone know what to expect? Would a doctor really understand what to do and prescribe me 65mg of diazepam a day?**

If anyone here is from Ireland I’d highly appreciate your input.

Thanks, and good luck to everyone who has to deal with this fucking poison.",1

I used to be a productive member of society and now I can’t even hold a job. I’ve interviewed for positions unique to me, just to get ghosted and see that they hired someone completely unqualified. Dafuq did I do or say?!

I’ve gotten rejected by graduate programs already because I couldn’t perform well enough on admissions exams. 

Things I say make me cringe, like, two seconds after I say them. Critical thinking is nearly impossible. 

But I’m trying so hard to move on with my life. I’m nearing the end of my clonazepam taper and just want to be done. 

I received an email last night from a professor I visited last month regarding a new grad program that interests me. She asked if I was still interested in applying, especially for the spring/summer term that starts in May. I told her I’d been planning to apply for fall, but she said that she’s usually flooded with applications then, so spring would be my best bet. 

The application deadline is Sunday. 

Fortunately I can skip the GRE and apply on the strength of my last grad school GPA (pre-benzo, of course), but there’s the matter of a personal statement. My 15-year-old transcripts might exempt me from the GRE, but they don’t say much about me anymore. 

I used to be able to write like a champ. It was my ticket into everything. Now, I can’t seem to muster the right words to even write a fucking Reddit post. How am I supposed to crank out a winner by Sunday? I have no confidence at all. 

What worries me most right now is rejection. I swear, if I get rejected from one more thing, I’m gonna lose my shit. I no longer understand what I’m doing wrong. I’m scared. But I’m also scared of holding myself back another year.

Well just under a month. I broke up with my boyfriend and I just started self medicating for the massive shock and anxiety I went through. I started using a mixture of benzos. A little Klonopin, and Xanax starting the 27th. And until now, the 24th. The dosages varied. Some days I took only .5mg of klonopin and some days I would take a full bar or two and a couple klonopins. A lot of the days I only took a half bar but like I said some days I probably took like 3mg of Xanax with a couple mg of klonopin..

I realized this shit is amazing but I am dependent so I decided to taper. It has helped my anxiety so much almost too much and I couldn’t not take it every day. The i overtook because finally I felt like I could socialize the way I always wanted to and I had amazing times with friends. Days I always dreamed of having..  well I started to run out. So I realize I have to taper. And at this point I only had 8 (.5mg) klonopins left for a taper. I heard it’s easier to get off Xanax (I mostly used Xanax thru the month) with a longer acting benzo and kloni was all I could find.

So I started just doing .5 mg I’ve been doing that 3 days now after my last Xanax day. 

I only have 5 pills left of .5 I figured I’d do like one more full pill tomorrow, then switch to 3/4 for a couple days then half and then 1/4 then done.

It’s all I’ve got. Should I be concerned about seizures or anything? Do you think it’s necessary for me to go to the emergency room to get help? (I live in a small town there are no detox centers and I don’t have a car) I’ve never used benzos like consistently before I’ve done opiate detox, but I don’t know what to expect with this, I know it’s a lot more concerning. 

So far what I’m experiencing is stomach pains, diarrhea, zero appetite, muscle tension and random twitches like on my eyes and my body every where at random times (it’s not constant), and ringing in my ears is pretty constant at times, also I have headaches and just anxiety. Oh yeah and the shivers and sweats sometimes. When I take my 1 klonopin in the day it all goes away for like 5 or so hours (ahhh relief) and then the symptoms come back until the next dose the next day. I also just have depression sometimes I go kinda into the suicidal place. I’m not afraid I’ll kill myself but my thoughts go dark there for sure..

What can I expect? Any advice?

TL;DR: I’ve been abusing Xanax and klonopin for a month. My dosages varied. Sometimes I only took .5mg klonopins. Some days I went crazy took a couple bars and some more. Most days I took half a bar. I took something everyday though. What can I expect with withdrawals? I only have 8 days worth of .5mg klonopins to help me taper. Should I be concerned about seizures?",1

They are very nice, fun people and we do enjoy spending time with them. But they are professionals, my husband is a professional, and I used to be a professional for a long time - before the benzos got ahold of me. 

I hate it when people ask me what I’ve been up to. How do I tell people that I can’t function because I’m too sick? All of my life plans fell through. Even my depression has depression. How do I say things without feeling incredibly awkward - especially when these withdrawals make it impossible to put a sentence together?

In the shower, I started labored breathing and couldn’t stop. Shortly after that, I started full-on hyperventilating. Is this even real? I wanted my husband to walk in, but he wasn’t speaking to me because my mood swings are galactic at this point. 

It must have been 10 minutes before it occurred to me: this is my brain starting to wake up. It’s rusty. It hasn’t been able to cope with stress on its own for a very long time, and it’s like a raw nerve. 

I started bawling after that - sad for how much I’ve deteriorated, but relieved because I could say “I know what this is, and it means I’m healing.”

My sweet gray tabby jumped on my lap and started giving me nuzzles, and wrapped her tail around my arm until I calmed down. It’s like she knew I just needed to ride the wave. 

That’s what this is, right?",35

Long time lurker in this sub but first time poster. Thanks for all your stories and being vulnerable here, it's been super helpful in my own journey.

I've been on benzos the better part of 12 years. Can't remember how many times that I've tried to stop. My psych providers always said I was on a low dose (.5 - 1mg Klonopin 2x day) and it shouldn't be a problem stopping. You know the story...

At the beginning of this year I decided that I wanted off the benzos for good. I talked to my current provider and made an initial plan to reduce by 1/4 pill every 2 weeks. I told him that was probably too much and asked him about the Ashton Method. He dismissed me, saying he didn't want to prescribe Valium since it ""kicks in too fast"" and said since I was taking a low dose I ""shouldn't have any problems"".

I made it down to .5 mg 1x day, which I was taking at night. I had been mostly stable for 2 weeks and was preparing to cut down again by 1/4 pill this week. Cut to this weekend - things in life have been more stressful than usual, and I was really feeling withdrawals (body aches, depersonalization, unable to sleep at night).

I caved and took 1/2 a .5mg pill during the afternoon yesterday and today. Feel pretty angry at myself that I backslid on the taper. I was doing so well, and now it feels yet again like I'll never get off this shit.

That's where I'm at now. Mostly just wanted to vent. Though if anyone knows a compassionate provider that follows Ashton in the Seattle area, a referral would be appreciated.",3

57 days ago i stopped 5 mg diazepam daily after a 7 month taper down from 40mg daily. I know this is not ideal, but I had no choice but to jump as I could no longer refill my prescription. 

The first 2 weeks after jumping I was completely fine, better than i'd ever been even. Suddenly at day 16 i got hit with every symptom in the book; crazy anxiety, insomnia, tremor, fuzzy vision, vertigo, ... That lasted at peak intensity for about a week, then started to subside over the next 10 days. At 5 weeks off, anxiety had gone and I got 8 hours sleep a night. 

Now, since then i'm randomly getting hit with these waves of an extremely drugged out feeling. At the least i feel like i'm quite drunk/took a gigantic dose of benzos; problems with balance, trouble reading, understanding my surroundings. At the worst i'm completely retarded and genuinely feel as if I took like 50mg diazepam and am high as a kite; i can hardly understand what others are saying/can't watch a movie, i'm 100% calm no anxiety whatsoever, i feel like i'm floating/dreaming/feeling light, everything seems to be happening 50 feet away from me/like it's not real. Sometimes I feel extremely tired as well. I never used to be able to take naps, but there are days where i can hardly stay awake at 3pm. 

When these waves subside i feel 80% normal, albeit it still a tad fucked up and benzo retarded. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?  Is this derealization/healing? 

Don't understand what's going on. 

Thank you.",9

But what I find weird is that now, during slow taper, it's depression that bothers me the most. Depression as in feeling low, dissapointed, lethargic, grouchy, miserable, and maybe all of it at the same time. Also, when I went cold turkey, or tried to, it was depression that was the most dangerous because I got severely negative, almost on the psychotic side, and contemplated suicide as the only way out.

I've been diagnosed with depression, but lately I've started taking L-methylfolate (long story), and seem to have been improving, had a lot of good days, and every single one of these bad days was related to cutting the dose of Valium. While stable, real epizode of depression rarely occured. This makes me think that benzos are contributing to my depression because I've experienced similar thing while being on antidepressant plus Xanax; I'd be perfectly fine until an interdose withdrawal striked and then I'd get severely depressed, which then I didn't recognize as such.

I'm currently on 1.5mg of Valium daily, that's such a small dose to do anything positive for depression or anxiety, and yet it's enough to fuck it all up when I cut my dose. This is all highly suspicious and it makes me think that benzos have somehow been worsening my depression without me being aware that it's happening. I might have ditched a perfectly good antidepressant (Lexapro), because benzo fluctuations in my system were brigning about depression that would otherwise have been cured by an antidepressant. Any thoughts about this?

My final conclusion is that benzos are a huge depression worseners because they don't really do anything for depression while taking them regularly, but withdrawing from them or having interdose withdrawals made my depression unbearably terrible, more than I would ever experience on my own without benzos. I have not read any numbers on this, but I also believe that they hugely increase the chance of suicide for people already depressed who take them.

So, assumin one does the taper, say by Ashton manual method, but one is not sure whether one is ""ready"" for the next cut, how does one go about it? Do one wait until one is absolutely sure, which could take indefinitely long, or does one simply take the cut upon the realization that withdrawal symptoms are mild enough and everything will likely be fine if the dose is reduced even further? (Assuming that one waits at least 7 days between cuts to be sure.) Do you simply follow the schedule and do the cuts say every 2 weeks regardless of how you feel?

Ok so I posted earlier this week that I was going to rehab/detox for a benzo binge. I was using a combo of alprazolam, flualprazolam, diclazepam, and adderall to keep me awake while on massive doses of benzos. I binged hard like that for a month straight then spent a month tapering myself down using diclazepam, I got down to around 3mg diclazepam every 24 hours to remain some what stable. It started getting really hard and I found myself waiting for my fiancé to fall asleep every night and getting up to search for the bottle of diclazepam she had hid, well I found it and she didn’t move it so I kept going every night and fucking up my taper, so I finally got sick of it and fessed up and decided to go to detox so I could just get off the fucking benzos.

So I of course finished off the already opened bottle of diclazepam I had on the way to the facility, which was probably around ~14mg diclazepam. I barely remember getting there or any of the first night as they also gave me 45mg oxazepam as soon as I was checked in. Taking this massive dose of diclazepam with its 42 hour half life plus the oxazepam my withdrawal didn’t kick in until about midnight the second night. After the first dose of 45mg oxazepam they started me on 15mg oxazepam once every 4 hours, accompanied by 25mg hydroxyzine, and the last 2 nights 200mg of seroquel to help me sleep, and the occasional clonodine to keep my blood pressure in check. 

Day 1: arrive at facility around 6 pm, doses with 45mg oxazepam, don’t really remember much, went to bed.
Day2: still no withdrawal all day, 15mg oxazepam every 4 hours
Day 3: withdrawal kicks in around midnight of the second night there, I am given 3 doses of 15mg oxazepam, and 25mg hydroxyzine, one clonidine, 800mg ibuprofen, and 200mg seroquel at 8pm. Withdrawal hit pretty hard, but I remained focused on getting clean and they really didn’t bother me
Day 4: same as day 3 except only 30mg oxazepam, one 15mg at 8am, one at 8pm.
Day 5: this is today, I got out today, no oxazepam or any other medication today, I took cbd, kava, and a little gabapentin when I got home, I’m feeling pretty good, withdrawaling pretty hard but I’m not letting it bother me, I’m going to an NA meeting tonight, and starting an outpatient rehab program on feb. 25. 

Again, I’m sorry for how terribly this is structured, I know it’s confusing and probably doesn’t make much sense, so feel free to ask any questions.",3

Also, I get this ""forced"" thoughts about jumping off a balcony, doing some harm with a knife, hurting people, and other very immoral and devious thoughts.

I went crazy.  We went on the internet and found RC's.  I took them successfully for 1.5 years and they got rid of pain and my sleep problems were solved, but after that they no longer worked as well, plus I wasn't getting much accomplished. I turned to Etizolam, but the escalation in taking 70 - 3 mg pills over a two week period and then going through detox twice alone and then the ER and being told to go into residential treatment was too much.  I finally got some long acting benzos to detox but that didn't help much. Sort of added more fuel to the fire. I was also on Gabapentin which I can say did not work at all in helping. I was not sleeping and twitching.   
I honestly went through hell and paranoia for days. I finally sought the help of a nootropics expert in town.  I said I would not but i needed restful sleep with dreams.  I got counseling while there and  only took 500 mg Phenibut with a small amount of an  anti-anxiety Racetum and ordered an RC benzo for intermittent use after using the Phenibut for 5 days.  After 5 days at 500 to 1000 mg I had enough.  I went down to 500 and then 250 mg for two days. The stomach upset from HCL because i could not find the FAA was too much for me, so I dosed a very small amount of a long lasting RC benzo after 12 hours off the Phenibut...and puff! I woke up this morning with an afterglow.  Instead of taking the Phenibut I took 5 grams Kratom for energy / pain, and I feel great.  I am going to be responsible with these substances as they are strong.  I am not going to take the Kratom with the Phenibut or mix them with Alcohol.  I don't drink anyway so that is a bonus.  I realize the different receptors Gaba a and Gaba b that these have an affect and there is no official study while one must absolutely use caution depending on your own tolerance and body chemistry. Most people don't get off on a small amount 250 mg or even 500 mg of Phenibut or a small amount of strong RC benzos.  Not the case for me.  The benzo use was very minimal and since I had taken Ranitidine and a bit of tums to deal with nausea from my Phenibut use and need for sleep it probably potentiated the benzos.  My body relaxed.  I did not eat protein last night which I think definitely helped.  Just macaroni and cheese with real irish butter and flax milk for creamy texture and threw in some USDA Organic broccoli. I am now eating Gabargenic foods and will not pick up my Gabapentin script as I feel like it sent me into a very dangerous zone with the benzo withdrawal.  I don't need it anymore.  I went through a long recovery after surgery and now that I can go without such a large amount of anything and use what I would consider to be pretty responsibly compared to where I was at....It seems worth it.  I do not recommend the concurrent use of Phenibut with benzos, especially if you are inexperienced i would not have done it, but my body and mind were exhausted.  While the phenibut brought out a very good side of my personality I will keep it on hand as I found myself very creative and getting things done.  I may buy some empty capsules and tums to use it again in a few days as my sleep and dreaming / remembering my dreams felt so darn good!  This morning I am on about 5 grams of Maeng Da for pain and mood with some mint and green/black tea.  I find coffee to be too stimulating to the point of panic attacks so I stopped using that.  I don't have any prescriptions and just want to say be careful using benadryl or anything like night time tylenol with that ingredient in it bc I was truly lucky as Phenibut and that raised my seizure threshold.  I was awake for 4 painful days before my benzo shipment came.  I stopped the Pheni and took the benzos and basically slept for two days. The second day of not sleeping is when I acquired the phenibut which I may order FAA because it definitely helped sleep after stopping the two day cycle of benzos. If you can follow you realize that the Phenibut did not help at first bc I was in total benzo withdrawal from Etizolam! Do not order Etizolam to deal with benzo withdrawal. Only a longer acting benzo will pull you out of it!!!! Phenibut powder made me have nausea and I don't want to get GERD or get hooked on any anti nausea OTC meds!  I'm going to pick up some natural ginger and mix it with coconut milk and honey next time I use the Phenibut alone with mint tea and black tea.  I am hoping to cycle this amazing nootropic with a small amount of a strong RC benzo twice per week and continue with my swimming trips since it felt amazing being in the nice cool water the other night until I absolutely do not need the benzo's anymore. I believe this is possible now. My body seemed to run on the hot side on Phenibut so while the Jacuzzi was bearable the steam room was not, but I believe if I go today that it will be bearable on Kratom.  Fortunately I was able to tell my family, friends, and bf about my sleep problems and troubles with benzos and a doctor without too much trouble. I no longer need pain meds, so that makes me very happy.  I had episodes of what I would call hypomania while on Vicodin and then Gabapentin.  I stopped the Vicodin months ago so that was not a factor, but the Gabapentin withdrawal for two weeks was intense. Not a good long-term therapy.  The best therapy was meditation for benzo withdrawal with deep breathing, the phenibut cycle, cycling with a bit of a longer acting benzo apart from kratom as well and swimming / keeping busy and talk therapy. Getting everything out and then writing it down. No longer in withdrawal and slept.  We had a great Valentine's weekend. Finally I had good times without second guessing myself and fearing for my life since Doctor's do not want to treat benzo withdrawal I say stay on the side of caution and only cycle them and use them apart. I must have read 500 articles and posts on Phenibut and benzos which made me scared enough to put in much caution and use only a very small amount of long acting benzos after I took down the amount of Phenibut.  Everyday use of any substance throws my recovery out the window.   
I feel productive. Writing down what I use and when is also helping get a grip on the terrible Gaba receptor meltdown I had. I think I upregulated and am happy where I am now. Its time for breaksfast. Have a great day and don't give up.  Consult a doctor first but be careful bc they put me on anti-depressants and it did nothing but aggravate the problem.  Anti-depressants are for depressed people, not people with social anxiety or GAD! Doctors played way worse games with my life than I ever did! They only helped me with a small script of long acting benzo bc they found the benzos in my system and I provided proof after weeks of begging! I could have had a seizure. Detox...unless I were rich was not an option because then again they would have put me on all kinds of medications and upon discharge I would have suffered only to start over trying to recover from the drugs they give you in there.  I will say that Phenergan should help if you can get your hands on that and take it as directed as it did in the first part of my withdrawal after seeing medical attention and some phenobarbital which i took in half doses for pure psychosis, but after I ran out I was on my own again and returned to having to help myself.  It was a trial and error deal and I played with my sanity and my life.  I never thought that daily Klonopin use would lead to this outcome.  I was told to take 2 per day. One in the morning and one at night.  I should have been told to take them when I NEEDED THEM.  That is what I do now. When I need them and carefully knowing that it takes time to cycle the half-life of other substances/drugs out of my system.  Before you hate we all have some kind of addiction. Mine came from doctors. I truly blame them for not giving me informed consent, but I have come far. From over 10 medications RX's to one.  I said earlier I don't have a script.  I still have one for a long acting benzo which makes me feel flat so I don't really take it much.  I prefer a longer acting RC bc they stay in your system in small amounts. That's all for now folks. I may rewrite this as I don't know how much sense it made but at least progress and not perfection for now.",6

I am attempting to, but every time I get terrible anxiety / adrenaline spike, chest tightness and other symptoms of ""impending doom"".","My main problem during taper / withdrawal is this constant, omnipresent ""adrenaline rush"" feeling, which is sometimes relatively mild and at other times so terrible that I feel like something very bad is about to happen, like me ending up in psych ward, getting a heart attack or some other worst case ""impending doom"" scenario. It also makes me very paranoid and anxiously depressed. Basically, it totally screws with my mind and body. I have beta blockers at my disposal, but I don't like using them too much them because sometimes they make me feel even worse in terms of depression, even though they help a lot with adrenaline rushes.

So, I wanted some way to desensitise myself to this adrenaline rush but I'm having trouble finding any. Before withdrawal, I was a regular runner, but now I can't even manage to run even the shortest distance without my adrenaline shooting sky high, which makes me feel like I'm gonna die. Basically, I cannot do cardio, only easy going yoga or stretching exercises are doable, which is good for relaxation and calming down, but what I wanna do is burn out this adrenaline and speed up recovery. This morning I managed to do some in place running, and it felt like dying, and after finishing it also felt like dying for an hour or so, and even after that I'm left with even more of an adrenaline rush. I feel stuck, nothing works.

I'm wondering if any of you has had a similar experience and how did you manage to get around it, if you did? Also, do you think that exercise actually speeds up the rate of recovery or am I just frustrating myself for no benefit down the road? Is it even a good idea to force myself to exercise when my adrenaline is already high, could this even be dangerous in some way?

*Note: I don't really know whether this truly is adrenaline or it's something else, but it surely feels like that. Adrenaline or cortisol, I guess.*",6

I went to a ""shite"" 7 day detox being on ~15mg diazepam a day for three years. While inside this government run homeless shelter/detox (I believe mostly for heroin addicts) they gave me 8mg of ativan a day for all 7 days and I was released. 

Two days later I was throwing up non stop, having SCARY thoughts, and someone went to a doc and got me 2mg ativans otherwise I wouldn't be here right now. It was scary and I've never in my life and episodes like that. 

I went to a psych.. and she said that I should've successfully detoxed off that regimen (she didn't see the details of the clinic.. just what I told her)... and I have now weened down to 4mg diazepam.. jumping down 1mg a week... so 3mg next week etc.

So question: do you smart people's know why that happened when I got out of that rat infested govt run detox center? Were they not benzo experts? Was 8mg a day for 7 days and then booted out too high to CT?

AND I'm worried when I eventually get to zero mg.. (in 3 wks) this will happen again? Or do you think I'll be more successful using the 1mg a week drop method?

Edit : Kratom sorry typo. 

I have yet to write my story and where I am at with benzos. I want to first say that anyone reading this and thinking of getting of benzos or in the process much respect. I'm not here to endorse kratom. Kratom is sold at vape shops typically where you can buy cbd. In some states in the USA it is illegal, and in the UK it is actually illegal. I'm not going to get into any big words or say something I am not 100 percent sure on as far as terms and what it does to the brain as far as gaba, transmitters & things like that. 
There are many different kinds of strains of kratom. Bali, Borneo, Malay and they literally all do different things. It's a powder or it comes in capsules for the most part. I take the powder. They have strains for anxiety, mood enhancement, sleep, pain, opiate withdrawal, as well as anxiety. A lot of people do take it recreationally because it may give a euphoric feelings. I am wondering if anyone has taken it to use for withdrawing and easing benzo symptoms? 
Personally I am on 40 mgs 10mgs 4 times a day of diazepam. I have also been on benzos for 18 years 🤦‍♂️
Yesterday my pharmacy was out of valium completely and I could have transferred it but I decided to wait today considering that the kratom helps so damn much with anxiety. The symptoms as well as not having the urge to take my diazepam. With that I have yet to even pick up my diazepam and have gone 24 hours taking 10mgs instead of the ( you can do the math ) 

With all this said even though the kratom is sold over the counter I would feel like a piece of sh°t if I were to say that the kratom itself doesn't have addictive properties. Apparently it's just psychological, but still I would be worse off without my kratom then my valium it is truly God sent for me. It is classed as a dietary supplement that isn't approved by the FDA. If you look up the brand bumblebee and the strain Bali it literally says on it what it's for. Just like the green Borneo says it is for euphoria. 

For me personally I think it is very beneficial and I know that by me using this kratom that I will be able to eventually kick a 18 year benzo dependency. 

I'm not here to try to push kratom or anything it just may be the answer you are looking for. It was for me because it helps with so many other things like mood enhancement and social anxiety. 

Has anyone used kratom to deal with the horrible wds from benzos?",3

Im just kind of a health anxiety mess at the moment and im failing to come to terms that these little niggling after effects are all from withdrawal. And also can't vent to friends and family because I've also had the recent shame of quitting alcohol at the start of September because I was an alcoholic so I've chosen to do this alone but then I found this site.

Ill give a quick timeline of events, started taking diazepam for about 10-15 days at tail end of November, then xanax for about 15 days. Last tablet on around the 28th of Dec then a day or two after I was hit with flu-like debilitating symptoms, body pains, headaches and pain, head pressure, nausea, bloating sore belly, tinnitus, heart palpitations, vision changes. This hell lasted two weeks and eased, actually it went for about three days then I started feeling vague malaise/fluish symptoms again, tinnitus on and off, heart pounding randomly, tender muscles points. Now fast forward to this date and what im left with is left eared tinnitus that varies in intensity, really really mild flu like symptoms that sometimes disappear then reappear. (absolutely nothing close to the intensity like the first two weeks but that sameish feeling as if its trying to creep back in or something) random muscles aches and tender points at times, random heart beating harder episodes, some niggling chest pain, some digestive issues, some head pains/pressure. Just for the record I've had varying bloods done, ekg, ultrasound of abdomen quite recently and all are normal and im waiting to do a 24hr holster test.

I can't believe this has happened to me after a generally short period taking not much larger than a prescribed dose(I got them off the street but took them at that dose). Are people just more suspect to this? Does me being a recovering alchoholic come into this?I had none of these problems before aside from some ibs....I don't know anymore. I need a kick up the ass or something and some support I guess :(",6

Every time I got sunk in deep dark depression, felt phobic about everything, generally didn't want to leave my house because everything seemed pointless and scary, got into doubts about my relationships with other people...etc. It all comes from a good intention: I want this WD misery to be gone as soon as possible so I can be a normal, healthy individual. But the real world effects are always opposite: more misery in every aspect.

If I stick to my taper, then I actually do things that are good for me. I go outside, hang out with people, walk my dog, feel good about life, but there is always something in me that just cannot accept being dependant on this substance so I always go back to deciding to end it cold turkey. And I fuck myself up (as described above).

The worst thing is, when I get into real bad withdrawal due to quitting cold turkey, my mind goes crazy with fears and negativity, and starts to invent things such as ""Going back to benzos is a weakness"", ""My whole life is so fucked up nothing will ever save me"", ""I should go check into the mental ward""... Just an endless stream of negativity that gets me almost suicidal because I don't see a point in continuing to exist that way. Sometimes I don't even realize it's ""withdrawal speaking"", I just go with it. So it's not just unpleaseant but also very dangerous because I will be acting from a messed up perception of the world.

I'm just saying things because I know many have probably encountered this situation and it will give them some peace, as many stories from other people did for me.",5

This is my worst nightmare.,"All I’ve ever relied on was my brain and doing everything I could to be the smartest person in the room. I thought it was the only way people would take me seriously and for all I know, it was. (I really hate to sound obnoxious, but please don’t let it be off-putting; it was the only thing that gave me any self-esteem at all.)

Now I have the processing skills of a 10-year-old. I can’t have a conversation with anyone without making an ass of myself. I’ve long since lost my job and can’t get into grad school so that maybe I can start again. I’m playing brain games, studying shit on Khan Academy to see if I can learn anything new (NOPE) and taking some community college courses to practice being a student again. 

I didn’t know this would happen. I had three “catastrophic” life events within six months a few years ago, and my doctor thought that Klonopin was appropriate. I never took more than prescribed and asked to go off of it several times, but my doctor said I wasn’t ready yet. I finally convinced him last week so I’m tapering off. 

Honestly, I’m desperate. I abstained from having children so that I could focus on a career, and now I’m staring down a life of...nothing. Not even being able to fit in with adults or accomplishing anything meaningful to me again. My husband married me because he thought I was interesting and successful, but now I’m neither, so why would he even want me?I’m not even 40 yet and I’m losing the will to even live past it. Nothing on the internet has given me any hope that my brain will fully recover - or maybe I’m missing it, which wouldn’t be surprising tbh. 

I’m so pissed because I didn’t ask for this. I tried to be so careful and I trusted my doctors. It ruined my life and may very well end it.",28

I had started having a few beers at the beginning of 2020.... just a couple beers once a week, nothing crazy and only because I thought enough time had passed.... except one night out with friends when I got wasted which was stupid (that was over a month ago). 
Yes that could have made it worse... but I now haven’t drank in over a week and still don’t feel good.  And I was only drinking once a week at most. 

When I was on 2mgs/day I felt fine all day (unless I was hungover, but I’m not gonna drink now for a while), functioned at a high level, took a simple 1mg in the morning and 1mg in the evening, never took more, had a perfect memory (no benzo effect there), lots of energy (no laziness or drowsiness) and didnt have to worry much about the Klonopin dose timing at all (except to bring the evening dose with me if I left the house). 

Nowadays I feel good for several hours a day after I take the morning dose of 1mg and thats it. The rest of my day is a nightmare. Literally. 

Should I just go back to 2mg? What’s the point of this? I was functioning at a high level and was very happy. Will I have bad effects if I go back up? Please help, I’m desperate and also started a new job a month ago, which may be causing some extra stress, but also it’s weird how I walk in in the morning feeling great, and several hours after my dose (usually right around 1:30 which is during my lunchtime when I’m relaxing) I feel withdrawal coming. I’m just so confused I don’t know what to do. I take gabapentin at small doses (1-200 mgs/day) and it helps but now I feel like I’m dependent on that. Ughhhh

So I was having panic attacks 4 weeks ago and I went to see a psychiatrist. He put me on these for 1 month:

1.  **Clonazepam 0.25 MG+Paroxetine 25 MG** 
2. **Sertraline 50 MG** 
3. **Clonazepam  0.25 MG**
4. **Promethazine Hydrochloride 0.25 MG (Had to take half each day)**

However, I after taking them for six days; I felt that I could manage my anxiety without any antidepressants and was also frustrated with numbness and zombie like feeling so I went cold turkey without knowing anything. Later I came to know about the dangerous withdrawal symptoms after I starter getting them 24 hours after quitting. 

It's been 4 weeks now and the symptoms have gradually faded, however I still have mild mental fog and derealization. The only concerned withdrawal symptoms right now for me right now are intrusive thoughts/racing minds very vivid dreams, and also I sometimes have sever anxiety in the morning

&#x200B;

My question is, it it possible that one week of dosage of above mentioned medicines could have exerted adverse effects or possibly brain damage? Or am I just panicking? Has anyone experienced something like this? Please let me know.

I haven’t had a relapse. I was diagnosed with bipolar which completely went away after I treated underlying Lyme disease (which was also causing neurological and constitutional symptoms). 

About two years ago I was given 1mg Ativan to help me sleep. I think the insomnia was secondary to other health issues which I’ve since treated. I kept taking it and then found it difficult to stop. I’ve successfully cut down to .5. I know this sounds like a small dose, but I tend to be very sensitive to meds so I think it’s effect is greater than the dosage indicates.

I Really need an OPINION AS IM LOST RIGHT NOW. THANKS REDDIT. 
Actually i have insomnia for a long term since i start my college. And i dont know it has something to do with my anxiety and stress untill i started doing weed. For about a year and half. It does help me a bits untill i feel it ruins my life where i wake up with panic and cannot back to fall asleep. Then it will be okay within 2 days. And i finally sleep. Oso tbh i have sex life party when im smoking weed. This is when the things start to fall apart, where i lose my job and start trade forex but not doing good at forex and lose my saving. And at the same year which is 2018 i quit weed cold turkey. Everything coming strong at me. My dad passed away within that year. Lose my job. A lot of bad things happen and then come the depression, anxiety and start to ruin my sleep. The thing with sleep is it alters your mood and energy. At that year i m at home and start blaming my self for what has happen. Btw im doing good at my college and got a decent job before that. And also on 2018, i didnt go to hospitals.. Just self medicate with 5htp and also  a little sex life.. It does wonder to me.. Within 3 4 months i no longer have anxiety and sleep great. And then i got a job at Jan 2019. My life turns 180. I was so happy back then and thoughts that it gonna be memories untill at Jun 2019 where i know a girl and plan to get married with her. Things go wrong when im fasting for about one month... I dont know where im lack of. But all of it comes again. Anxiety, Depression and sleep. The major issues is sleep. I have perform 3 blood test and go to psychatrist at this time. And nothing comes abnormal so i believe it is something to do with my mental. And it all goes on untill this day. Luckily i still have my gf but i lose my job already. And doc prescribe me with sertraline and clonazepam, before this. Celexa and lorazepam. And i think i got bad panick attack from lorazepam. Becuase i cold turkey on those meds. I literally try everything for sleep. Herbs and anything u name it. Untill i have amitriptyline.. It does wonders for me a couple of weeks and then it starts creep me out. Im a freaking zombie on it. So i stop taking it. Now what i have is zoloft and Clonazepam. Ive try zoloft not really help. And klonopin. Ive been on it.. It kills my anxiety and i sleep thru the nights for 7 hours. The thing is i read an horror story about it and currently im not working and i still get some sleep. But wake up every 2 hours and one hours which is leaving ke fatigue and zombie on the next day and i was thinking is this because of amitriptyline and klonopin. Should i be taking it again. I barely function in this five days.. Bedridden. Want to sleep but cant. And when im jerk off. I feel okay for one day and back to normal the next day. Im not saying jerk off is good but it does lift my moods. Right now im blurred what to do.. Should i not taking the klonopin or DOES THING GETS BETTER? BECAUSE IVE BEEN IN THIS BATTLE FOR 8 MONTHS.. And sometime im ok.. Sometime not.. I was thinking.. Am i bipolar.. But doc onpy diagnosed me with GAD and Clinical depression. Im blurred. I just want to have my life back.",4

Friends: 
Since the day I was born, my goal was to be a successful adult. I was one of the smartest kids in school, had a ton of friends, went to a great college and earned two degrees, got a stable/fulfilling job right out of college, and became widely respected in my field. I met a handsome man, married him, and we bought a beautiful home. 

My husband got his dream job and it only made sense for us to move closer to HQ, about 800 miles away. So being the cool wife that I am, I agreed to quit my stable/fulfilling job (after 14 years!!) and begin life anew. 

But that’s fucking hard, uprooting your life like that. Before we left, I lost a pregnancy, traumatically (had to be hospitalized three times). When we got to our new spot, I found a job that ended up being hell on earth. Any of those three things make a case for chemical support, but all three within six months made my new psychiatrist pull out the big guns. She prescribed clonazepam. 

She told me it wasn’t a “lifetime” drug and I understood what she meant. I’m not sure if clon made me feel better, but it certainly didn’t make me feel worse. 

About nine months later, my husband and I bought a house that was an hour away, so I had to switch psychiatrists. It roughly overlapped with when I was able to leave the horrible job. 

I assumed my new doctor had read my file. He knew that the triggering event was work-related, but we just discovered a few days ago that he thought the problem was my lack of a fulfilling career. No, the problem was the hellhole that I was no longer in. I’d complained to him about the side effects that it seemed like clonazepam was causing, but he literally said no when I had previously asked to go off of it. “Your depression is situational, and once your situation has improved, then we’ll discuss it.” Turns out that for the past two years, we’ve been talking about the wrong situation. Well, fuck. 

So he said at this point, it’s appropriate to quit. But my life has gone to absolute shit. I was fired from two jobs for reasons I couldn’t understand. My husband is constantly angry with me for not being the woman he married. All of my professional responsibilities that followed me from my 14-year job, well...they just sit undone and no one even asks “how’s that project coming along?” anymore. 

It’s clear that I need to get a new career, but I can’t get into a grad program because I can’t get the test scores that are needed. Shit, if you tell me to remember a two-number sequence, I’ll forget it immediately. It’s become difficult for me to talk to people because I will say embarrassing things unintentionally. 

So here I sit: housebound and unemployable, and I’m not sure who’s responsible for this. I took my medication as prescribed. I tried my best to advocate for myself, but there was no reason for me not to trust my doctor. It just feels like if I never left my former city, I wouldn’t be a shell of a person right now; my husband and I resent each other for “how things are” now - he’s living his dream and I’m trapped in a nightmare. 

Where do I go from here? What do I tell myself? How do I get over wasting five years of my life (three on this shitty prescription, and the two years it might take to recover)?",4

I was originally prescribed it for PTSD and found it unhelpful for acute panic. I skipped a night or two here and there, but was pretty consistent, and the dose was usually closer to 1mg than 2. I usually crushed it and took it sublingually. I had a lot of pills, but was about to run out. About three days ago, something really good happened that improved my life situation quite drastically, and I decided I'd just quit taking the Klonopin (I know, bad idea).

Last night, I had a full-on crying, shaking, lying-on-the-floor panic attack that lasted for what felt like hours. I had horrible suicidal ideations and couldn't stop trembling. This morning, I woke up with what felt like the flu. I have a fever of about 101.5, extreme aches and chills, vertigo, shaky legs and difficulty walking, a bad headache, lightheadedness, and tremors. I have on-and-off stomach cramps and a reduced appetite. I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety. 

The thing is, **I also have a runny nose and a bad dry cough**. I'm a university student and it's midterms season, so my school is basically a viral illness factory lately. I've been immunized against the flu, but I know that's not enough to keep me protected entirely, and I'm mildly immunocompromised (on an immunomodulator, but not an immunosuppressant). These are the only two symptoms of mine that don't seem consistent with benzo withdrawal, but it's enough to make me wonder if I'm just sick and feeling anxious without the Klonopin.

I guess what I'm asking is if any of this seems consistent with withdrawal, or if I just got unlucky (or, I guess, lucky by comparison) and caught a bad viral illness that was well-timed with my discontinuation of Klonopin. I'm also wondering, given the short duration of my use of the drug, what level of concern should I have about my cold turkey discontinuation? The panic attack really freaked me out.

Sorry if this post is kind of long and incoherent. I'm having a hard time focusing. Thanks in advance.",3

Been so hard to try and get off both but decided to wein down off the xanax as I was taking quite a lot in the time I was using and was having some really nasty withdrawals. I still since I relapsed haven’t missed even a single day of using Ice. Today I had a panic attack at work for the first time, it was actually so scary and I was so embarrassed and couldn’t stop crying.  I guess I am writing here today to find out if after all benzo withdrawels are done, will the anxiety go away? Will the panic attacks go away?. Drugs have really taken control of my life it feels so awful!!! I have been off work as I was convinced i fucked all my muscles. I have been annoying my doctor thinking all my benzo withdrawel symptoms are the signs of corona virus. I used to go to narcotic anonymous last year before I relapsed but it never really did anything for me. I have lost all my savings, im just about ready to lose my job. Ive completely isolated myself. I go away on a holiday for a month in a weeks time and I am excited as I can properly detox and be away from any temptations.

I’ve officially made it a month benzo free and, I feel better than ever!

When I was searching for guidance/stories online they weren’t that readily available. This is my third attempt; previous two were cold turkey, this one was a slow taper. 

By the time I quit I was on .5mg of Alprazolam...

Feel free to ask me questions if there’s anything I’ve left out. A combination of the following helped me this time around:

—Do a taper, but DO taper. 

-Supervised detox: work with a mental health/substance abuse/dependency counselor who will monitor your detox and keep you accountable with your tapering schedule. They’ll also make sure you don’t withdrawal too hard. 

—Mindfulness: Anxiety is part of the human condition, we all feel it from time to time. (It does pass)

-Meditation, 
-yoga, 
-spiritual practice, 
-affirmations, 
-pattern interrupts, 

These are all invaluable tools when an episode of anxiety hits. 

—Sleep: a big one I kept seeing online. While tapering, detoxing, there will probably be some insomnia. Sleep gets better. Exhaust yourself. 

-Started waking up at 5 AM and going to the gym. By the time I get to bed I’m ready. 

—Non-narcotic supplements: 

-Melatonin for sleep, 
-valerian: helps with anxiety as it binds to the same GABA receptors, 
-5-htp: for anxiety/depression. 
-Magnesium: mood stabilizer, take before bed time. Also helps with some ease the detox fog. 
-CBD: non psychoactive aids with relaxation, sleep, cognition
      

-Day-0: While there are things you can do to ease the detox, it’s going there are going to be parts that are a little unpleasant. You’re going to have to do it eventually. I promise you; eventually on the other side, you’re going to feel better than ever before. 

-=Remember you experience moments anxiety, you don’t have anxiety. Don’t claim a condition. The moments eventually pass.=- 


Note: I am not a mental health specialist. Please speak with a professional. That being said, make sure that you advocate for yourself.

During a very stressful time in my life 2.5 years ago, my psychiatrist prescribed 1mg clonazepam to take every night. (I am a small person with a fast metabolism.) Either she wasn’t transparent with me about the side effects and WD, or I was too desperate to care. But every time I lowered my dose, my rebound anxiety ruined me and I couldn’t even remember a two-number sequence that someone told me two seconds ago. 

My next psychiatrist cut my dose in half like it was nbd, but I’m now realizing that it took me awhile to stabilize after that. My cognitive awareness sharpened a little bit. 

Now I’m tapering off completely. My doctor said CT was fine, but I tried that for one night and it really messed me up. So I’m tapering with the pills I have left (plenty of them). 

My memory has gotten so shitty in the past few days that I won’t leave the house and I don’t want to talk to anyone. I’m terrified of making bad mistakes and burning the bridges I have left.

Secondly I mostly visit when I need encouragement or feeling discouraged of tapering off clonazaepm. Here’s my original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/dc05z0/how_i_got_here_and_where_i_am_trying_to_go/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and I have made slow but steady progress. Been on my .25mg morning dose for about a week, this is from 1mg. I still take a whole 1mg at night. And yeah I’ve been dealing with stomach, headache and mood swings but the worse is being tired but not sleeping a full night (restless) which has never been an issue. 

And it was actually a bit helpful to see someone recently post “I feel like I ruined my life”’and it really spoke to me. I didn’t want to hijack their post so I wanted to create this. I know ppl talk about getting their life back and it’s worth the WD process but I wonder what makes it so much better. I’m not being flippant and think it’s great for everyone. I don’t want to retype my original post but been on the same dose for 12 years, after about 8 years at .5mg 2/day for panic disorder. And was on it between 15-17 yrs old, only stopped cold turkey when I started college and partied. Once that stopped my panic attacks returned. 

So anyhow I only thought about getting off the meds bc I don’t think it works other than my brain expects it. Plus I move a lot and it’s just a pain to find a new doctor and get the prescription. So just thought hey if I can why not but not sure what other benefits are from not taking it. Again just really wonder what I’ll get gain by continuing. Thanks for listening.",5
2020-02-06 14:07:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ezx5p0/sos/,S.O.S,"Hey guys,
I’m a former opioid addict who has been self medicating with benzos to alleviate some anxiety and depression but I now know it’s time to stop. I kept all the dates on the packages but I’m not exactly sure how long it’s been. My best guess is somewhere between 5-6 months. I skimmed the Ashton manual(trying to do a home taper as any hospitalization will raise red flags among my family who I am living with and may end up in me becoming homeless after I just started a new semester of classes. I finally managed to come up with some money so that’s not an issue I just need steady income(I’ve been looking pretty hard but the unskilled job market where I’m at isn’t so great)

Right now I usually take 20mg of etiz and 20 of pyraz and I’m trying to switch to just diclaz(I believe pyraz has a fairly long half life) but nobody stocks it anymore. I’m low on supply with a small pack on the way but I wanted some help from some who have been through the journey and came out the other side. Right now if I went cold turkey(not going to willingly) will I be at risk for hospitalization? And if so how long? I’ve heard if you go to prison and tell them you are dependent on benzos or highly alcoholic they will just give you Librium and let you ride it out. 

I have quit cold turkey a 3 or 4 month habit about a year ago but the dosages were much smaller. I’m still on subs because of my recent relapse but I don’t want to taper concurrently.

So some big questions,

How do you establish a good baseline dose?
Should I tell my GP and/or sub doc about this?
Should I write down my daily doses? Keep a taper journal? I have an mg scale so I can safely say that my dosages are accurate. 

I’m trying really hard to live in the moment and I have plenty of support but ideally I make this as painless as possible and not have to be hospitalized as I could end up on the streets again.

Well that’s about it, I won’t hit you with a wall of text but this is my last place to go, my only other friend who has tapered off is not returning my calls regularly.

TL;DR Have about a 6 mo habit. Dose is at 20mg etiz and 20mg pyraz(if you read the post that may be too high). GP does not know nor my family I’m living with and I don’t want to have a seizure or go to the hospital, as this will jeopardize my living situation/school/work etc

I’m now pretty far into my taper, and I gotta say, I was not expecting this. It has been so hard. I’m pretty consistently in a terrible mood. I don’t ever feel like going out, and when I am with friends, I feel like there’s a huge barrier between us. From what I’ve gathered, it takes a long time - like many months or years - to feel ‘normal’ again. Honestly, I‘ve never experienced adult life without Klonopin so it’s tough to imagine what things will be like in a year or two.

I’m definitely not giving up, and this sub has been helpful. There are some good things about tapering to mention. My other destructive habits are more easy to identify now that I’m hyper focused on trying to get better. I do feel like my life has a bit more purpose and hope even if I feel like things are absolutely terrible in the moment...if that makes sense.

Anyways. Thanks to everyone on this sub for being open and honest. Tonight I think I’m going to go to an NA meeting to hear other people’s stories and maybe share mine. Since I’m struggling with being around my friends these days, maybe I’ll find better company with other people who are in a similar place to me.

Love and strength to all ❤️",25

For the past 8 months, I've been prescribed 0.75mg a day (45/month) but I often take 1mg daily and run out early. Honestly it is not enough to manage the anxiety and it hasn't been for years. Reasonably, my doctor does not want to up the dose.

 My doctor and I want to lower to dose and eventually get it to where I'm not taking it daily. I'm scared of withdrawal and I'm scared because my anxiety is already unmanageable. Has anyone had experience getting off benzos after taking them for years? How long did it take you to feel okay? What might I expect?",3

I recently jumped from diazepam and have seen some small improvements in withdrawal symptoms.

Sadly i'm on a bunch of medication for heart disease as well. Since I jumped, I feel like my body is reacting to the other medication. My heart medication does not have anything to do with GABA or glutamate, but yet I feel pretty sedated after taking this medication.

Has anyone else reacted to other medication after jumping? Can i continue taking this medication (have been taking it for over 2 years in the exact same dose/schedule)?

I finished my Valium taper last Friday after being on benzo s for 8 years.

I did a faster taper than the Ashton but under an Addiction Specialist so I am happy that it's ok.

Now I am off this I want to move forward. I am planning on booking a long haul flight.

Question is... Is anything going to hit me in the next two weeks or so due to the half live of Valium?

I'd like to get on with my life and not be scared hence the flight for a long break (yoga and meditation). But wanted some opinions if possible from people who have been through this.

The last thing I want is to be hospitalised or worse in an Asian country. I doubt my medical insurance would even cover such things to be fair.

Also I know people will say just try to get on with life normally. Fact is it's been such chaos and I've been housebound I want to force myself to do this too.

Thank you",5

From Wikipedia:

""Flumazenil (also known as flumazepil, code name Ro 15-1788) is a selective GABAA receptor antagonist[1] administered via injection or intranasally. Therapeutically, it acts as both an antagonist and antidote to benzodiazepines (particularly in cases of overdose), through competitive inhibition.""


My insurance won't cover the rapid benzo detox (where they slowly drip Flumazenil into your veins) nor do I wish to inject myself with needles... But apparently intranasal is an acceptable ROA?


I am able to source Flumazenil very cheaply, but I cannot find any literature on how much/often I need to take (intranasally) to deal with these nightmarish PAWS.


I'm really desperate here, any advice would be amazing.",3

I am with a dilemma about my next reduction.

I started taking Xanax (0.25mg daily) when I decided to give a chance to another antidepressant, Prozac, this was like 1 year and 9 months ago. This AD made me very anxious to the point that I couldn't relax by the day and I was barely sleeping. When my psych decided to raise the dosage of Prozac, my anxiety skyrocketed and then I raised the dosage of Xanax arriving at 2.5mg daily at some point. Changing my AD to Zoloft, I gained strength to abandon the benzos... at the beginning of 2019 I was taking 0.5mg of Xanax and 5mg of Valium daily.

From this point, every Xanax reduction was a pain, making me panicky and stressful for like 3 weeks and only feeling good after, like, 2 months.

Currently, my benzo regimen is 0.125mg of Xanax + 2.5mg of Valium. I reduced the Valium from 5mg to 2.5mg two weeks ago and I didn't have any extreme reaction, thankfully. But I wonder if it's too early to evaluate.

Now, I remember that the Xanax to Valium switch was really painful, and I wonder if, given my scenario, if it's better to stop taking Xanax instead of switching again to Valium.

I am 2 weeks at: 0.125mg of Xanax + 2.5mg of Valium

I am considering stopping the Xanax on the next week, taking only 2.5mg of Valium daily.

And then, some weeks later, fully stopping the Valium.

Does it sound like a good option/plan? I don't want to keep using these stuff for so long!

I have been taking .75mg Klonopin a day for about 3-4 years now (.5mg in the morning, .25 in the evening). I tell the doctors that I take 1mg a day that I way I get 60 of the .5mg instead of 45. I know I shouldn't lie to my doctor but let's be real. Finding a doctor you can trust can be the hardest job in the world.

I always wanted to have a bit of an overflow stash of pills in the event I run into issues, and I'm glad I did because those 'issues' just hit me. I saw a new doctor who is VERY uneducated and wanting to taper me way too quickly. She wants me to cut my dose in half and so I just got a refill for 30 pills instead of 60. This doctor's office is a shithole, I even submitted a complaint to the Florida Board of Medicine.

I tried to talk to her about the Ashton Manual and maybe try some other taper regimines but she's one of those doctors that will never do what a patient suggest, or even consider it, because she's the 'educated' one and I'm the 'junkie addict'.

Anyway, so I've been taking a pill and a half every day for a few years and I truly do want to come off but I want to do it as safely and effectively as possible.

For the past week, instead of taking half of a pill for my evening dose, I've only been taking a quarter of the pill. Not sure what the percentage of this is but I wanna say it's somewhere around a 15% decrease.

I certainly do feel the effects of that decrease. For the most part, it's tolerable but still sucks. I am going to be seeing a new doctor hopefully in the coming weeks but I'm just wondering if anyone who has gone through a similar taper has any advice for me. For now at least, I don't have the option of bringing in a substitute like Valium but I do have probably a couple months supply. I'm just wondering if I can get off this without dealing with hellish WDs.

Oh yea, my new doctor prescribed me lexapro and said it'll help when tapering but I haven't heard anything good about Lexapro and I'm not a fan of the side effects so I told her I'm not taking it. I am not totally against anti depressants and I've read on here several times that there are some SSRI's that really do help but I can't remember any of the names.",3

&#x200B;

I just want to share and give some insight into what I had gone through once I stopped taking Klonopin.

How much and how long I took?

* 9 months
* 0.75mg per day on average

What happened once I stopped taking it cold turkey?

* Symptoms came only after 2-3 days
* Heart palpitations
* Extra energy
* Waking up early and trouble falling asleep
* Insomnia

How long they last?

* From the onset of the withdrawal symptoms around 6 days
* 5 difficult nights and morning

After 2 weeks I was totally without any withdrawal symptoms. My body adjusted back and now feel like I never took it. Also note that I did not really have a serious underlying condition to treat with benzo so I had no difficulty continuing my life without it. This might be a big difference between someone and me.

I also want to note that during WD I was a bit concerned and panicky about the possible complications like seizure (which was totally unrealistic in my case) which contributed greatly to my anxiety during WD. I would have felt a lot less anxious during it. I think it is good to tell people that it might happen but can give false anxiety to people like me.",5

Was out of money and the doctor didnt care so I had no choice but to quit without tapering..

I can say without a doubt that the first 2 weeks were the worst thing I've ever expirenced in my life, with the worst symptoms being extreme hallucinations, paranoia, voices in my head, constant fear of dying, and finally seizures where my brother discovered me seizing and called an ambulance..

Was sent home with meds to increase seizure threshold and Zopiclone since I hadn't slept for days.

&#x200B;

I still get flashbacks of withdrawing 10 months later, I remember exactly what I was thinking during every panic attack, hallucination and I still have heart palpitations.

Almost everything feels scary to this day, and not a day goes by without thinking of either suicide or just start using benzos again even though I know I probably won't be able to live through another withdrawal. But the thought of putting my family through this is what keeps me away from it.
