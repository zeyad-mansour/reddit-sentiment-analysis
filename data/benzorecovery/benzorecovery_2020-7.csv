See on this day I woke up on a ventilator from an attempt at suicide, I drank over a liter of vodka, and swallowed jesus only knows how much klonopin. (I had a pretty good tolerance) 

In the ambulance I became combative and they shot me up with a mixture of haldol and midizolam which stopped my breathing or so I thought. It’s important to note I have a very real phobia of being restrained and I told them to not tie me down. 

I already had a line in for fluids while they attempted to figure out what I took (they had no idea how much I drank or how many pills and I wasn’t telling) so it was easy for them to get the drugs in me. I watched the clear liquid drain, felt the warmth, the back of my head went fuzzy, the corners of my eyes were going dark, I remember smiling and saying “oh no that did it” poof lights went out. 

Beep, beep, beep. ‘Fuck my head hurts’ beep beep ‘fuck me sideways turn that shit off’ as the light burned my eyes I felt something in my mouth and I still hadn’t realized the beeps where coming from the device that saved my life and was breathing for me, I attempted remove the object in my mouth. 

My hands and feet where restrained in leathers, what I could move was my tongue. I gagged and coughed try to spit the damn thing out little did I know it was about 12in deep in my throat filling my lungs with life saving oxygen. 

My nurse walks in looks me in the eyes and says, “Mr. Anon, you’re up, what do you remember?” I shook my head no, she said “that’s for the best”. “I’ll call the respiratory therapist as I assume that tube is tickling a bit.” I nodded “yes.” My nurses name we’ll call her Christy. 

I felt the restraints again, panic pools my chest, the ache in my head pounds in deafening symphony with the beeps. My blood pressure spikes to 180/120 my pulse over 105, and then I realize, I am withdrawing. I am sick as a dog pouring sweat, now fighting with what little strength I have to free myself. 

Christy is calm as an angel, wipes the sweat from my eyes and says “looks like you aren’t waiting for the therapist.” I try to scream but all I do is gag. She says loudly “Mr.Anon you have to calm down so I can get this tube out”. I force myself to stop moving and she puts her hand on my chest and says “okay on 3 cough as hard as possible, 1,2,3” she pulls the tube out of my chest which was now the most painful moment of my life. 

“FUCKING CHRIST” I say unable really to talk at all. Christy says “good I didn’t damage any vocal cords” I remain silent and just look at my hands. Unable to believe the relief of breathing on my own, I ask finally “what happened and how long was I out?” Christy said “well technically you were dead, but that was only for a few minutes... youve been on the ventilator “asleep” for 26hours, you are very lucky Mr.Anon I have never seen someone alive after a .323 BA plus everything else.” 

I am retold the horror movie that was my trip to hospital that day. After they gave me the midazolam and haldol, obviously I blacked out, and hulked out. I fought off a set of emts, 3 firemen, and 3 nurses thank god no one was hurt but a few bumps. I broke 2 sets of velcro restraints and one set of leathers. My hands hurt bruised and cut and I still bare the scars. Apparently what actually killed me is unknown because I was administered so many different drugs to try and calm me down. (I will include the list) 

My doc said they’d never seen a human with the strength I had, he didn’t think it was possible to break leather restraints, well the torn muscles in my arms and chest told a very different tale my tox screen came back negative for everything but benzos and an obscene amount of alcohol. I asked to see the nurses I had hurt, and 30mins later these 3 lovely women came in my room and talked with me for about 15min. I cried and begged for forgiveness. I tend to be the “funny guy” in the room so I made sure to turn on the charm as best I could and promised them I’d get clean.  They left hopefully with different idea of who I really was. 

The end of this story is just another horrid withdrawal tale so I’ll leave you all with this to ease your minds about who I really am. 

I am bipolar 1 and had no idea I was in the middle of a manic crisis. I am in good relations with my current psychiatrist and psychologist. 

I never hit or fight anyone especially women (that was true even during mania I only abused myself) and I have been stable for over 9 months without a manic episode. I take my meds every morning like clock work with my coffee. 

I am almost 24, and have personally taken a walk with the Grim Reaper and I am a much better man for it. Benzodiazepines where absolutely the cause of my rapid mental decline. 

I plan on never touching these drugs again for as long as my borrowed time remains and I want to open my own detox clinic for the less fortunate specializing in alcohol/benzo related addiction but for now I help folk out at the local hardware store. I would not be here if wasn’t for my mother or my sister. 

Most importantly I’m alive.

I had been doing .25 at a time but what I thought were withdrawals last summer were so challenging I decided to finish off by going down .125 at a time. Typically things get very bad at about 3 months after a taper and then stay bad for another 3 months or so. Here we are holding 7 months later and my anxiety and depression are worse. I’m having racing/anxious thoughts constantly , I’m restless I hate everything and almost everyone and my hormonal issues are on overdrive. I feel completely hopeless. I blamed last summer on the klonopin but I’m beginning to wonder if I just lose it Im the summer. I’ve also realized that it was summer when I was put on this stuff in the first place. Does anyone feel things get so much worse in the summer, did it get better down the line? I talk to my friends and they’re like “ohhh I love summer”. I’m like of course you do, you’re sane :/   Lastly my chronic pain is at an all time high.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973894953727722}"

So, I started messing with benzos earlier this year, around May probably. I don't take them on a daily basis except for some week long binges here and there, you know the deal. I think I had like 3 xanax binges like that so far, and was always able to cold turkey just fine, with just rebound anxiety and insomnia.

Now, since I'm taking some days off work, I've been popping them pretty consistently lately, altough I never take more than 4mg in a day and never for more than three days in a row. 

To make it short: I've been paranoid as fuck and just wanna know if I should already be worried about seizures or any of those worse withdrawal symptons, you know? I wanna know when I should worry about a taper. And how to taper too, since my use isn't really consistent nor long-term.

My last dose (4mg) was on saturday, two days ago, and I'm feeling no withdrawal symptons whatsoever (aside from the desire to pop a bar).

Firstly, I want to say that reading all of everyone's stories on here is truly inspiring. I know many of you have been on benzos for YEARS and I can't even imagine that.

I just want to say that firstly, I don't know if what I'm going through is withdrawals. So I wanted to ask for opinions. About a month ago, I was put on Xanax for the first time. I had bad anxiety from health reasons, so every night for about 3 weeks I took 1 mg of Xanax before bed. Some days the anxiety was so bad I'd take 1.5 or even 2. Then, about 2 weeks ago I met with a doctor who told me to stop the Xanax completely, and I was to be on Clonazepam for ONE week only to get my nerves down since I hadn't really had anxiety issues in the past. I took 1.5-2 mg daily Clonazepam for a week like instructed, then stopped cold turkey.

Last Wednesday was my first-day benzo free in a month and I honestly feel like shit. My heart is racing- I can literally feel my heart in my chest and neck despite it being a pretty normal pulse rate, my anxiety came back even worse, I have horrible tension headaches every day that make me feel like a walking zombie, and I even got a throat infection and had to be put on antibiotics (that could be totally unrelated though).

I know my journey with benzos wasn't long, but does anyone think my symptoms are related to cutting them off cold turkey both times? And if yes, how long will these symptoms last for?",2,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9949935078620911}"

2020-07-26 11:37:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/hy8yft/what_happens_in_your_body_with_benzos_written_by/,"What happens in your body with benzo’s, written by a friend of mine well-versed in benzo withdrawal"," GABAergic system (GABA receptors) is an inhibitory system, counteracting the Glutamate system (Glutamate receptors), which is excitatory.

GABA and Glutamate regulate action potential traffic.

GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, stops action potentials. (Rest and Digest)

Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, starts action potentials or keeps them going. (Fight or Flight) 

Since GABA is inhibitory and Glutamate is excitatory, both neurotransmitters work together to control many processes, including the brain’s overall level of excitation.  Under normal conditions these two system are in balance leaning this way or that based on external forces i.e. a bear attack (excitatory system takes over, adrenaline floods the system, muscles tighten, vision and hearing are heightened, mind races, anger takes over etc.)  or i.e. bedding down for the night (Inhibitory system takes over, muscle tension decreases, cortisol levels drop, adrenaline levels drop, body prepares for digestion, sex and sleep.).

Benzodiazepines (as well as alcohol) attach to the GABA-A receptor site of the GABA receptors located on the dendrites of the cell neuron, imitating the natural GABA, signaling to allow a higher than normal flow of Negatively charged chloride Ions to pass though the GABA receptor gate depolarizing the neuron, super-activating the inhibitory system and overly suppressing the Excitatory system.  Benzos also force natural GABA to bind tighter and longer to the cell dendrites signaling thru the GABA-A receptor site to also allow more Negatively charged chloride ions to pass through.  Result = Very relaxed.   

As a result the body up-regulates the Glutamate receptors (Excitatory system) and releases more Glutamate, which then attaches to the Glutamate receptors allowing more Positively charged Sodium and Potassium Ions through counteracting the Negatively changed Chloride Ions and bringing back the overall balance.  If the body has more of a Negative charge it's relaxed, if more of a Positive charge it's more alert.

Where this all goes wrong is when the body and brain, due to being flooded with too many Negatively charged Chloride Ions, start to eliminate a minor yet significant percentage of the GABA receptors on each cell trying to hinder the Chloride ion flow.  When this action fails to work the body and brain take further steps of producing new GABA receptors without the GABA-A Benzo/alcohol/GABA attachment site.  All is well and good until such time as the newly produced GABA receptors now lacking the GABA-A attachment site outnumber the older receptors which still have it.  When this happens those prescribed benzos start to experience interdose withdrawal (Anxiety and Panic while still taking the medication). Doctors will try to solve this issue by prescribing a higher dose, however, very quickly the body responds by producing more GABA receptors without the GABA-A attachment site, plus will continue to absorb older GABA receptors.  Soon, Tolerance of the med hits.  The meds poops out.

While the early days of the above disaster are unfolding the Limbic system of the brain, thyroid, pituitary gland, etc. which are directly attached to the GABAergic system start to misfire and odd states of reality, emotion, fear, anxiety, paranoia, memory, balance, aggression states, sexual arousal etc. become more and more pronounced.  Moreso once tapering begins and worse still once off the meds.  Here are the parts of the Limbic system which start to misfire.

Amygdala -  The Aggression/Emotional Center.  Responsible for detecting fear and preparing for emergency events.  Fight or flight.  Stimulated, it produces feeling of anger, violence, fear, anxiety. Damaged, or medicated, can result in a very mellow state of being, hyperorality, hyper sexuality, disinhibited behavior - ignoring social conventions and engaging in dangerous, reckless behavior. Responsible for fear conditioning, the ""associative learning process""  where we learn to fear some thing, some place, someone, and/or a social circumstance. 

Hippocampus - Memory and spatial navigation. Forming new and storing memories. Coverts short term memory to long term memory.  Responsible for emotional reactions to past memories and events.

Thalamus - Regulates the body's voluntary motor control, consciousness and its sleep/wake cycle.  It also regulates the senses of sight, sound, taste, touch and the sense of where the person's body is in space.  

Hypothalamus - Produces hormones which control the production of hormones in the pituitary gland. Hypothalamus function is directly related to overall hormone health.  Fight or Flight/Rest and Digest plus body temperature regulation.  Responsible for the release of adrenaline via the autonomic nervous system.  Hunger, thirst, sleep, sex. The hypothalamus sends danger signals to other parts of the brain and puts them on high alert, preparing to fight or flee. It also tells the pituitary, adrenal and thyroid glands to secrete more hormones to prepare the body for action.  

Cingulate Gyrus - processing emotions and behavior regulation. It also helps to regulate autonomic motor function.  Emotional Memory.  Regulates pain and emotion.  Is particularly involved in driving the body's conscious response to unpleasant experiences, therefore the avoidance of negative consequences. 

The end result of this, in part, is the Excitatory Glutamate system is no longer being kept in check by the GABAergic system so it's running wild.  This causes overblown and confused states of mind (anxiety, panic, confusion, memory, depression, phobias, etc.), body malfunctions (thyroid, putuitary, tachycardia, automonic nervous system, etc.) and pain becomes the norm (neuropathy, lower back, etc.).  To add insult to injury now the patient has to come off the meds, the only substance slowing down the  Excitatory system and giving it even more freedom.  Unfortunately glutamatergic receptors are not homeostatic like GABA receptors, changes to glutamatergic receptors stick around.  Since GABAergic medications or substances no longer work to offset the now raging Excitatory system all one can do is endure it (survive) until such time as new GABA receptors are being created with the GABA-A receptor site.  This is what happens during the healing process (Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome) and is entirely dictated by the level of damage done by the medications and the genetics of the individual which allow how fast the body and brain grow new GABA receptors with the GABA-A attachment site restoring the broken and off balance systems. 

In the meantime, any substances, or states of mind (Stress), which irritates, or boosts the Excitatory Glutamate system must be avoided.  Items such as sugar, MSG, caffeine, any GABAergic agent (alcohol, St. John's Wort, Camomile, 5HTP, KAVA, Z-drugs [Ambien], Phenibut, etc.) and everyday chemicals and foods become landmines as each can cause horrific increases in withdrawal symptoms for the individual, again based on genetics and sensitivities, and since GABA is directly responsible for muscle tone and mass we also experience a wasting, withering physical state.  We lose muscle mass, gain (or massively lose) weight and have an immune system which is barely there all while the body and brain are malfunctioning on a level never imagined possible.

P.S. For ease of understanding, it only takes one day to burn down a 100 year old forest, but a long time to grow it back..  Your GABA-A receptor forest has been burned down by benzo use.. This forest must regrow and it's takes a long time once GABA agonist use has stopped.   During this time, no GABA agonists can be used, most especially alcohol..  Alcohol is kinda sorta like liquid benzos, and benzos kinda sorta like freeze dried alcohol,  they are cousins.  One cannot replace one with the other or healing will never happen and GABA-A receptor sites will have no reason to regrow.   Also, the two highest concentrations of GABA-A receptors are the stomach/gut and brain.  Which is why those in recovery have so many issues with food, digestion, etc and mental health issues. There are approx 100 Trillion GABA-A receptor sites on the Human Body.. one for nearly every cell.. Every system is impacted..  Every.. System..",23,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9746695160865784}"

He has been taking .25 of a bar every day for the past 2 months from that stash. He decided to stop before it got out of hand and went cold turkey one week ago today. He says he hasn't slept in 4 days and its starting to effect his work. He reached out to me for advice. However, I don't know what to tell him because I was an addict who took 8+ bars a day so my situation was wayyy worse.

He has plenty of supply left over. Should he taper? Or should he just tough it out since he's gotten this far? I tried to look up the Ashton method but everything I was finding was either for people taking high doses or using it for years. If he should taper, what taper plan would you suggest? He has to work tomorrow and can't afford to call out. He just needs sleep. He's already tried weed and Night Quill.

Any advice would be helpful!!!

EDIT: I meant to say he's been taking a quarter bar every day. Not .25mg.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994582533836365}"

I knew the dangers of Benzos going in, but the immediate relief from my constant anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and simply having the ability to relax was too strong of a pull, and here I am. 

While I don’t feel that Clonazepam has ruined my life, I started to recognize issues that it has created - lack of interest in many things, lower libido, blunted emotions, and just generally feeling disconnected from my emotions and daily life. I can see myself becoming a shell of a person, and I’ve decided to start the steps needed to banish this drug from my life. 

12 days ago I decided to start a taper - going down from 2mg a day to 1.5 a day. My plan is to stay on the 1.5mg a day for a month, then decrease to 1.25 for a month and then 1mg for a month, etc etc etc until I’m done. So far, things have been going well. I can feel my brain becoming slightly more active, and a slight increase in energy, and even mood overall. I know this is the right thing to do. 

For those of you who have successfully tapered, I’m very interested to hear what you think of my tapering schedule, and if this is a good way to to approach it. As I said, so far so good with the 25% dose reduction, and I think I’m far enough into it (12 days) that my levels have balanced out, given the relatively long half-life of Clonazepam.  I am also taking Remeron and Effexor for depression - those will be tackled in the future at some point once the benzos are gone. 

Would love to hear some feedback and opinions on this! Thanks everyone.",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9804252982139587}"

I'm 29, female, and every time I have a new issue, I end up being convinced it's cancer and am just ready to die, not that I want to die, I don't!!  It doesn't help that when I google some of my problems, they lead me straight to "" get checked immediately"" and all sorts of stories about women that thought they had fairly innocent problems and then had ovarian or some other type of cancer. I know that I wouldn't be able to fight and have chemo or whatever after all I've been through so I know I'd have to just go on and die. These thoughts are so consuming because I ask myself "" look at the hell I've already been through for over a decade.. 5+ chronic issues, abuse, surgery and now the benzos, why WOULD'NT I have cancer? why would IT be off limits?"". And I'm just so tired of waiting for the next thing to go wrong, I think that's why I try to find it.

Has anyone else struggled with this to such an extent? is it the benzos making me think untrue and catastrophic things about myself? Why is my brain so determined to take me to these dark places?

These 2 weeks haven't been the best for me, but not even the worst, since even before I started the taper, clonazepam wasn't even doing it's job that good anymore, maybe my body got used to it and still I would have ""yes"" and ""no"" days even before, so now I kinda have had more ""no"" days, but not that hard until now, they can be managed. I also have noticed, that some days, having a coffee can help me and give me a boost for a while, while some days it really makes things shittier. I don't have a coffee every day, maybe one in 2-3 days or so, when I see that I could benefit from it.
Should I have any coffee like I do now, or totally cut it?
I also ride a bike almost everyday, even if a little, just to keep my body with some activity, since I am working from home, and I stay home most of the time.
Brain fog has been on it's worst for a while now, even before start of taper, so I seem not to be able to do anything about it.

Day in day out everyday is a new feeling or a continuous feeling or a new symptom or anxiety is controlled or out of control. I can’t remember the last time I’ve had a full day where how I felt wasn’t on my mind at some point. I try to distract myself as much as possible, but the underlying feelings are just toned down a little and for a brief amount of time.

I never had anxiety issues before my old doc prescribed me Ativan. The only time I ever had anxiety or panic attack is when I smoked way too much weed. But once that was clear and gone the next day and I would go about my daily life. No problems, no issues. And those occur very very rarely. I’ve been taking Ativan as prescribed for 4 years now, it was 2mg per day, now I’m down to 1.5 over the last year or so.  I’m just so confused at this point if the feelings I’m having are really all caused by the tolerance withdrawal or the for sure anxiety/panic disorders I assume I’ve developed over time while being on these things. So, I’m afraid that once I get off them, things won’t really be that much better. I’ve read plenty of success stories that prove it does, and plenty of horror stories that proves it doesnt. 

I just want to live life. I want to go out and do things and not always have that shadow over me and being so unsteady and unpredictable with how I’m gonna feel that day. I try to exercise but that just makes the anxiety worse. Ever since the Covid outbreak I’ve been pretty much home bound which I know doesn’t help. But shit, how can I exercise when I feel terrible after and how can I go out when I feel terrible? I know exercise if probably crucial to toning down the symptoms, but ugh, it’s just so hard to commit to when I react the way I do to it.

I'm a 20 years old Frenchman living in Central Europe, I've been on a benzo, prazepam, for 4 years now, as advised by a doctor because of sleep issues (that are since resolved). I've been withdrawing on and off for 3 years, and am now from the initial 40 mg down to 4 mg (= 4 mg diazepam), which is a pretty mild dose.

Within the first two years on benzos I've dropped from school, been sent to hospital and put on 5 different medications without getting any diagnosis whatsoever. But then took it upon myself to start withdrawing from those pills, find a job and resume my studies in a foreign country, facing up with all the difficulties that led me to being this first position, and learning to build myself in spite of all adversity. 

I've managed to keep tapering at a steady rate for a long time while pushing myself to maintain good health and lifestyle, through sports, socializing etc.. but as studying ended up being a major part of my life, I had to put a break on the recovery process as it impaired me too much through learning, and  I simply couldn't focus on it as much as needed. From then on I decided to remain on the same dose, 5 mg, I'd start tapering again after getting my degree, I told myself.

Unfortunately, things didn't turn out as I expected them to...

Throughout those last years I've noticed how deeply I've changed, I've welcomed this new personality, looking away from the damage undergone and keeping in mind the main goal, which is to adapt, find meaning and try to know myself better. Though withdrawal was painful, it is only through it that I could've addressed some issues and made the hard choices. Now that the symptoms had gone, and that the effect of the medication had kicked back in, things had taken a strange turn, a bad one.

I just remember noticing how things were starting to affect me less, and took it in a good way, at first. I was less anxious, sleeping better, more focused, but after a while this morphed into generalized indifference. At the time I had to move on to another city, and after I settled down I think I might have been so fed up that I chose to go cold turkey, which obviously turned out to be a very poor decision.

I ended up in severe withdrawal, sick and panicking. And at some point I must've felt so overwhelmed that a separation occurred between me and my feelings, or they turned off. I remember being in my apartment, on the verge of having a panic attack, but loosing connection with all fearful thought and conscious feeling at the moment when my heart went crazy. I spent the next few days wandering in the city in a deeply troubled state, getting back home at random hours to sleep, visiting friends to tell them how weird the situation seemed, and above all intrigued by this inability to experience any fear and my mind gone blank. This lasted up to the point when I had a seizure at a bus stop, was transported to the university hospital and given an injection of diazepam.

When I was discharged back home, I resumed prazepam on the 4 mg dose I remain on today, this strange state of mind has dissipated but my relationship with feelings is just not what it used to be. Apathy is what defines me the most right now, I've kept going with my studies and then lost all interest with it, and as disappointed as my family is I just find it hard to care. I broke up with my girlfriend, as if love was never involved, and forgot about her almost immediately. When interrogating myself on my goals and motivations I find nothing and though I still have my memories I can't associate myself with them, or remember what I used to feel back then. The 3 months spent in lockdown have not made it better, I lost touch with friends, sometimes being reproached of being too cold, spent my days reading random books and barely sent any homework done, to the dismay of my professors. 

I'm wondering if those changes are permanent, if I've not turned into a sort of sociopathic robot... Just hope it has to do mostly with the medication, and that I'll be able to get my emotions back when done with it. I wonder if anybody's going/has gone through the same issues, and what decision you took to make it better.

I wanted to see how everyone else s experience had been regarding withdrawal from benzodiazepines alone or through the help of an SSRI like lexapro.  I am asking because I actually attempted to withdrawal last year without using an SSRI. The experience was humbling and scary. I would get a lot of anxiety on a daily basis and in between doses of even the long lasting klonopin. I would maybe get 2 hours of relief and then it would hit me, waves of shakiness and sweating along with panic attacks. I could rely on breathing exercises and such for some slight help but it was very very rough and to be honest I couldn't keep going and reducing significantly. 

Then I asked my doctor to go back on an ssri like lexapro. Within a month and half to two months I noticed that benzos did not affect me so tremendously or in between doses . It didnt matter as much whether I took klonopin morning or evening, my withdrawal was much smoother and I didnt get waves of horrible anxiety. I have been able to taper from 1 to 0.125 while on 10 milligrams lexapro since last June.  I am sure i can probably even jump at this point to zero klonopin. I also obsess a lot less than when I was tapering from klonopin alone. 

Does anyone have similar or drastically different experiences ? I wonder why this is so and if this means I substituted one dependency for another. I know SSRI s are not addictive like benzos but they still pack a punch. I guess I have always been a science minded individual and I want to understand the root of my anxiety on a chemical basis. Hell maybe I ll need to be on lexapro for the rest of my life if this means no benzos but I d prefer not to be since SSRI s kill sex drive and make me very emotionally apathetic and numb. Anhedonia is not sustainable long term. Thank you in advance for reading.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9969398975372314}"

I’m just seeking some advice about what I can expect from withdrawals. I have been experienced with a lot of drugs for over the past 15 years or so. I have gotten my life together the last 4 years and have cds. I’ve been through benzo withdrawal when I was a lot younger so I know the symptoms. I recently got off of a month or so long habit of Phenibut and was able to switch over to baclofen. I also had been a prescribed a low dose of Klonopin 1mg a day for a few months at the start of this year and was able to taper off/ stop taking  them with relative ease. About ten days ago, my friend  gave me ten 2mg bars for doing a huge favor for him.

 I fucked up and made some stupid excuses and went ahead and accepted them. For the last 10 days since last Friday I would take about 1-1.5 mg a night right before bed and I tried to skip a few days here and there. 

Yesterday, around mid afternoon I started getting that characteristic major irritability followed by extremely bad waves of panic and anxiety later on in the evening. This was about a day and a half/ 2 days after my last dose. I had a little under 1 mg left, so I took that and slowly started to feel better throughout the night. I am kind of freaking out and am already starting to feel extremely anxious. It is worth noting I probably only got about 2-3 hours of sleep last night. 

At my disposal, I have a bunch of gabapentin, 5 .5mg of Klonopin and my usual 30-40 mg of baclofen a day. I am slightly encouraged by the fact that I was only on the xanax for a week and a half but am wondering if I’ll be able to do a quick taper with what I have, or at least have a semi bearable cold turkey. Unfortunately I am not in a living situation where my room mates can know what’s going on.

I am planning on taking a high dose of gabapentin as soon as my stomach empties, and am going to go as long as I can without taking my Klonopin. Also I forgot to mention I have about 20 Lunesta 3mg.

She nor my Dad believe how bad Benzos are for the mind and body long term and they don't believe me when I tell them how hard it is to stop. They believe since the Dr prescribed them that they must be totally safe to take. God, I just feel like I am banging my head against a wall when I try to explain things.

I’m talking both mental and physical stresses.

I quit benzos around 9 months ago and started using again 3 months ago, sadly. During the time I quit, I wanted to keep my life going and carried on working a stressful job. I also started going to CBT therapy where the therapist was pushing me to do exposure therapy for some of the phobias that were triggered or exacerbated during withdrawal, even though I was still very early in the process.

What happened was that, even though my withdrawals from 3 years of clonazepam were not that severe (I believe I’d already been in tolerance withdrawals for a long time), I ended up experiencing more and more panic attacks and becoming agoraphobic.

I managed to stay off the benzos during all this but left my job due to agoraphobia and consequently lost my flat and had to move back in with parents in a bit of a dysfunctional household in an area far away from my social circles.

I was practising a lot of things which I thought would build me up but now I’m thinking were probably just over stressing me. Things like regular intense exercise, cold showers, fasting, regularly gently pushing my boundaries of agoraphobia.

In the last few months I’ve had some really scary physical symptoms which led me to start using benzos again out of desperation; chest pain and left arm pain, rashes and chest swelling, fever, exhaustion, chronic difficulty breathing etc. I was sure they would tide me over and just get me through the days and nights until my immune system and doctors help diagnose and fight off whatever is happening, and was also using them to manage agoraphobia when attending hospital appointments.

3 months later I’ve not had any success medically besides some antibiotics which helped for a few days, and I now have a daily benzo habit again. I’m retrospectively starting to believe that although I was off work, I was over stressing my body and my mind during a sensitive period and it’s caused all these physical issues to manifest and persist. 

I’m a bit trapped in a vicious cycle now of stress, physical discomfort , and benzo use. Trying to break it by managing stress as much as possible and just going completely easy on myself spiritually, physically, mentally.

TLDR: Do you think it’s best to just remove all stress during recovery, or should you push yourself to keep some normality? When should you start pushing yourself, particularly regarding phobias?

I sleep for two or three hours at a time and wake up, then doze back off, and then wake up again. This goes on all night.

My taper works like this: Because clonazepam has a long half life I don't consider just the days, but the  quantity of an entire week. The spreadsheet help me calculate how much clonazepam is going to be in my body and the percentage of reduction in relation to the last week.

 **Exemple**: Right now I take 0.25mg once a week, and 0.125mg 6 times a week, my next reduction in 3 weeks is going to be 0.125mg 7 times a week. The spreadsheet says is going to be a 11.52% reduction

The quantities in the days are not the quantity i'm gonna take, is the quantity is going to have in my body. In the image sunday 26 of july I'm gonna take a 0.25mg pill, because of the log half life I'm still gonna have 0.249 mg so it appears 0.499mg in the image. 

The colors of the days represent how much I'm gonna take. White= 0.25mg, Yellow=0.125mg(half a pill), Green = nothing.

Is what I'm doing safe? Some days are being really bad for me, I was actually tried last week to  just take 0.125mg(half a pill) every day, but sunday I just couldn't sustain so I decided to go back to 0.25 once a week and 0.125 6 times a week and want to keep it for 3 weeks, last time I kept for 2 weeks. Does it worth to switch to diazepam?

I had to think this because I'm away from my psychiatrist. Because of the virus, university closed, and I moved back to my parents house in another city, and the psychiatric support was a part of the university. I'm still can get prescription so access to pills is not the problem.

Please help me find my way back....,"About 20 days ago, on July 1, I got the bright idea to go and pick up a Klonopin script even though I had just finished detoxing big-time like a month and a half to two months prior. I was dealing with a ton of anxiety and I wasn’t able to sleep and I was just exhausted from that and I made the judgment call.

20 days later and I’ve used about 40 mg. I went right back up to the dose that I was on before I quit back on May 15.

I’m telling myself that this will be easier this time because I’m not a full month in but I really ended up sliding into some other outside issues that fucked up my brain chemistry even more. Now I’m dopamine crashed, gaba crashed, god knows what else. I desperately do not want to fall back into Benzo addiction But I fear the kindling effect has already done its work

I have about 30 mg left. What do I do with them? Is there a way to taper somewhat briskly that is not going to make my life miserable? As usual I am trying to escape consequences but I’m here now and if I can get through this without giving up or going mad I would like to. You guys have always been the upmost supportive as well as knowledgeable.

I'm curious to know if there exist long-term (say, 1+ years) users of moderate doses of benzos (let's say 10+ mg diazepam daily), who actually didn't have too difficult a time during their taper (or cold turkey if that was the case)? I've been through benzo withdrawal two times, and one time it was a pure nightmare train through hell, and the other it was not fun but comparatively quite manageable. I've now been back on benzos (medically prescribed), around 10-15 mg Valium per day, for years, but am looking to taper off again. All we tend to hear about on any of the online forums are the nightmare stories, for obvious reasons (people with good or mild experiences are not seeking help and not obsessively reading about every symptom and every hope of alleviation of pain, as those of us who suffer do). I thought it would be nice to hear a few ""it wasn't so bad"" stories to just brighten mine and everyone else's day. I realize that everyone responds totally different to benzo withdrawals, so even one person's good story is no guarantee that another's won't be brutal, but just for the sake of positivity, anyone?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9962233304977417}"

Lately I suspect that the kpin is causing fatigue/even more depression. I find it incredibly difficult to wake up and feel sluggish/depressed in the mornings, sometimes causing me to quit jobs because I feel like I can’t function Sometimes I’ll just take a half (1mg) and then a quarter before bed and I still wake up and feel this way (I’m assuming because of the long half life). I don’t want to go off of it because it’s helped me so much through the years but I’m considering switching to another benzo or changing my dose. 

I don’t see my psychiatrist for another month and I can’t afford to quit another job. Does anyone suggest I try a different dose/benzo? Any advice is appreciated.

I, unfortunately, went through a tough antidepressant withdrawal from Venlafaxine, and after finding out how common the issue was I decided to get started on creating an application to help. 

I was also given Diazepam but I was lucky to only take it a few times and after research, I decided not to continue, I even noticed a strange ""Anxiety Rebound"" which was extra strong when they would wear off, so I can only imagine how tough it must be to come after long term use!

The app is simple and just allows you to keep track of your symptoms as they come, so you can identify any patterns or triggers, and it allows you to enter your tapering schedule and view it on a calendar, with new features coming soon.

It's still in early stages so there is a long way to go but with your feedback, I am really excited about where this project can go.

At the moment it's made with Antidepressant withdrawal in mind, and I used the 10% method as a guide when setting up the tapering schedule feature, so the maximum speed you can set up the calendar for is 10% reduction every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks. (It's also not designed to tell you or calculate your taper, it's just for you to put your own schedule in, see your reduction dates, monitor symptoms etc.)

I am posting here to see if you think it might be useful for Benzo withdrawal also, I have had people comment that it may be useful before. The symptom tracking feature I'm sure will be helpful!

I work on this in my spare time and by myself, so any support or feedback is greatly appreciated. It's available only on iOS for now. More information is available at [http://tapertracer.com](http://tapertracer.com/), or just search the app store for TaperTracer. I'm also on Twitter @TaperTracer

tl;dr - Made an app for antidepressant withdrawal, would love for you to check it out and give any feedback or suggestions on how I can adapt it to be useful for benzo recovery also.

I’ve read so many posts, here, on Facebook groups, and part of me wants to just stay away from the horror stories but feeling shitty and not knowing how long this is going to last is killing me.

I’ve been on 1.5 mg of Xanax for about ten years. I never take more than prescribed, but I don’t take it as prescribed either. Instead of taking .5 3x a day, I always just take all 1.5 mags at night to calm down. I think I’ve been having interdose withdrawals for a long time by doing it that way. Those, plus a feeling of absolute lethargy and disiterest led me to Kratom, which I thought was harmless at first but have been steadily abusing for the past four years. Well, I CTd the Kratom three weeks ago and that sucked. I also started tapering the Xanax in March I went down to 1.25 mgs. Maybe that triggered something but my doc had me cut again to 1mg three days ago. I figured I was already feeling bad so why not.

Sorry for the long windedness but my question is this: I can deal with this horrible feeling but I want it to be over as soon as possible. I have to go back to teaching middle school in September. Can I make .25 mg cuts every 1-2 weeks safely? Does this increase my likelihood of feeling like ass for months/years after stopping?

Hope everyone is recovering well, just need some advice on the final leg of my journey . I posted here before but have some updates plus new information from my prescriptions and doctor appointments in order to be accurate.

I started Xanax in February of this year for Generalized Anxiety Disorder resulting from a medical condition which has since healed

Feb 17th to March 17th (Month 1) - I took as needed 15mg over the whole month

March 17th to April 17th (Month 2) - I took as needed 15mg over the whole month

April 17th to May 17th (Month  3) - was prescribed 45mg  for the month i finished it and would say i avg around 5mg on the weekends which left me with on avg almost nothing through out the weekdays

May 17th to June 17th (Month 4) -  was prescribed 90mg and same as previous month except i had enough for 1mg on the weekdays

June 17th to present (month 5) was perscribed 90mg again but by week 3 so 1 week before refill i had 50% left so that is 45mg over 21 days again more heavily on weekends.

I started my taper 8 days ago

Day 1 - Day 4 i did .25mg at 9am & 9pm. (Day 1 has some headache and brain fog but by day 2 it really cleared up and by Day 4 i had no symptoms)

Day 5 to Today (Day 8) i have taken .125mg at 9am & 9pm (the first day was rough, the second was really bad with bad headaches, nausea, light headed, dizzy, and anxiety) but by day 3 i felt sooo much better and today is day 4 and i feel excited again and want to be social. still little bit of light headed but its also 110 degrees (45 degree Celsius) and i go outside to smoke cigs so possible the light headed is from heat. 

The way i see is i have 3 options

Option 1 - Continue on .125mg twice a day then quit

Option 2- Try to lower dose again but the pills are so small its basically crumbs and dust (0.5mg pills)

Option 3 - Just quit 

I figured that with Xanax that half life is so quick that .125mg is basically nothing and by time evening dose comes its pretty much almost out of my body i have a fast metabolism. 

what do you guys think based on what i told and your own personal experiences

In the last few months (I think since May) I’ve been lowering my dosage (not very scientifically). I started off alternating a full pill one night then a half the next, then just going to half pills (0.25) for 2 weeks at which point I just stopped. I hadn’t noticed too many withdrawal symptoms, mostly just crankiness, up until I quit.

I’m on day 4, feeling decently crappy but at this point I just feel like I should power through. Last night was the worst so far, I had a really intense panic attack and felt sick as hell. I can get a script for a smaller dose pill from my doctor, but I’m really getting to the point where I’m resentful of the pills. I mean, if that small of a dose makes me withdrawal this bad, I want to stay away. This feeling has gotten me through quitting other things so I’d prefer to use the momentum while I have it. Also I am on Lamotrigine (have been for a while) which makes me less freaked out about seizures, plus it’s stabilizing my mood. Also got ondansetron for the nausea. CBD seems to lessen the tremors and body ache (I usually smoke a little weed but have been avoiding it while I’m in my current state)

I haven’t been able to nap since taking these. I used to nap every since day before this. I eventually warned myself off the Xanax with help from Seroquel. I’m still on the seroquel til today. Even 200mg gives me fragmented sleep, waking up every hour or two. Previously, 25mg of elavil used to be too sedating that I had to split it in half. Now, I have to take 75mg of elavil to give me like 5 hours of sleep. And that is considered a good night. Something in my brain has changed. I have tried all the supplements, magnesium, melatonin, magnesium, valerian, you name it, I’ve tried it. 

I stopped the xanax completely first week of March. I basically weaned off from end of Jan to beginning of March. I was put on valium to help wean, and also seroquel. 

Is it possible that I am experiencing protracted withdrawal? My sleep has not changed since I stopped the benzo. I am wired. I did notice when I was weaning, when my body knew it was time for Xanax and it didn’t get it, I would have a pounding headache, body aches, etc until I took the Xanax then everything would settle down. I haven’t had that since so I thought I was no longer experiencing withdrawals. 

I also wonder if the fluoroquinolone toxicity contributed to the insomnia. 

Basically looking for guidance or anyone’s experiences with protracted withdrawal. I was on Xanax for about 9 weeks. And a high dose (2mg for the first 4 weeks before realizing and weaning).

First of all sorry for my English. It is not my mothertongue.
If this is to long please scroll down. 
I am Taking Benzos prescribed since 6 years. First 9mg Bromazepam with drinking 12 Beeres everyday.
2 years ago I stopped Alcohol.
1year ago I tapered off Duloxetin maybe to fast which I took 8 years.
Actually I am on 1mg clonazepam. 0,5 mg every 12 hours. And 150mg trazodone.
I have following symptoms: Depression, Often anxiety, Dysphoria, no energy, lack of motivations no feelings.derealisation. I can't even relax at home or elsewhere. I am just starring or am in my phone as I can't stand reality. Googeling symptoms of benzo withdrawl. 
2 years ago I was totally fine. I had fun was very outgoing person, funny, studied. Worked. But 2 years ago everything crushed. 
So I am not 100 percent sure if my symptoms are all benzo related. Cause it started when I weaned down duloxetin 90mg over 4 years. 
But from what I read it could also be the clonazepam that is turning against me now. 
So now I don't know what to do.

In total I was on benzos 6 years. Doc switched me over from bromazepam to clonazepam 6 months ago. No gradual taper... Just switched me.
I went to 3 different doctors.
All told me that 1mg is such a low dose. I should just taper like 0,25 every 10 days.
Another one told me to switch over to valium 10mg. And taper with liquid drops.
And I habe talked to a doctor in Belgrade who does flumazenil treatment. He told me he had so many patients talking so much more.... He was really sure and told me I won't have withdrawals with the Flumazenil they would just hook me on the Flumazenil give for 4 to 5 days. Longer if necessary and quit the clonazepam cold turkey and give me valporid acid for some weeks.

What do you think.
Are my symptoms benzo related?
What would u do for a taper?
Try the Flumazenil (sounds to good to be true)

I made to much research.
And every option scares me.
But I am 35. And unemployed at the moment. Living with my mom.

2 years ago I was another person.
I wanna be that person again.
But idk how I can't stand withdrawls with all that symptoms I already have.... Will it get better?
Which route should I go?
I know the ashton manual. But I can't taper over 2 years or something cause I will be homeless if I can't get back to a state where I can work again. Which I actually can't. Even going to a grocery shop gives me anxiety.
I never had this kind of symptoms before.
I started benzos always prescribed in a alcohol rehab. But couldn't stop drinking. So ended up on both.
Never took more or binged.
Please help me find an option.
Tapering with Valium.
Or klonopin.
Or try the Flumazenil.
If u need to know more please ask.
Any input is welcome.

I've been tapering 5mg of Valium over two months after experiencing I believe tolerance withdrawal. I'm currently down to 1mg for two weeks now but I have to ask, are symptoms supposed to get better the lower the dose?
I went from 5mg to 2.5 without being aware of the importance of benzo withdrawal, symptoms got worse from 2.5 to 2mg.  

I hear some around here their experience tends to be worse at the smallest dose than it was higher. I've got occasional internal body and leg tremors but acid reflux/heartburn is bad than it ever was. 

Can you still experience tolerance withdrawal when you linger at a dose for too long during taper? 

Sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm new to all this. Just didn't think 1mg of Valium would do anything at this point.

Audio recording of the below for those who are unable to read: [https://soundcloud.com/quipment/071420-benzowithdrawal](https://soundcloud.com/quipment/071420-benzowithdrawal)

&#x200B;

Hi friends. I am 18 months off a CT of 2mg of K per day (**DO NOT CT**). I was prescribed it for 3.5 years. I was also prescribed 40mg of amphetamines for 1.5 years.\* I quit this CT at the same time. I wanted to share my experience and hope for those going through what can feel like such an unnatural hell. I’d like to frame it using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as I found myself in turmoil on every level of being.   My symptoms were severe, but if I had managed a slow and steady taper my withdrawal would’ve been more manageable.

Please note that I am not a doctor nor a scientist; everything I share is purely my own perspective and is not medical advice.

# 1. Physiological needs

**1a. Diet**

After some trial and error, I found that a strict keto diet helped me the most. I consumed high amounts of protein, minimal amounts of carbs, and avoided sugar, spice, and everything nice (i.e. all processed foods). Seriously, the blander the better. A typical meal for me consisted of a single chicken breast seasoned with pepper and a small serving of vegetables. I stayed away from comfort foods, prepackaged meals, restaurant meals, and hot sauces. My taste buds got last priority.

I also found that eating 6 small meals per day as opposed to 3 large ones helped to reduce my symptoms. Having an empty stomach or digesting a large meal seemed to give me more anxiety whereas having a small amount of food in my stomach seemed to provide some relief.

As for liquids, coffee thrust me into horrible states of panic and alcohol, while providing some relief in the moment, made my symptoms considerably worse the following day. I stuck with water. I can say that, at 18 months, I am able to consume both coffee and alcohol more or less normally, though I choose to avoid the latter as I continue to heal.

Lastly, because maintaining my diet was so critical to my general wellbeing, I found my times in rehab and psych wards to be personally detrimental. The food was largely high carb and caloric and, as a result, my entire stays in these institutions were spent in the worst waves of acute. Due to the mental state I was in, I was unaware that food was the cause of my suffering until I had a plain chicken breast meal and my symptoms let up tremendously. Diet is so, so important.

**2a. Sleep**

In a way, I was fortunate to be coming off of amphetamines at the same time. Without the speed it was used to, my body just wanted to sleep and sleep. At months 5-6, I did take melatonin for a time but found that it significantly increased my depression the following day. Once acute ended at about month 7, I could take melatonin again.

I’m sorry I can’t be of more help in this area. I know a lot of people struggle with this. I can say that the further I’ve come along, the more my sleep has improved, to the point where I’m amazed just how rejuvenating and refreshing sober sleep is. I dream again and I wake up with energy. I think this has been one of the greatest factors in the vast improvement in my quality of life.

**3a. Exercise**

I stayed indoors for the majority of my withdrawal and found little to no motivation to exercise. The few times I did, however, I felt so much better. Going for a run seemed to decrease my anxiety and stress tremendously. If I couldn’t run, I would walk, mostly in the early mornings when my symptoms were most severe. Lifting weights was somewhat less enjoyable given the agoraphobia, but I have heard people say that this helped them a lot too.

Sometimes, when I couldn’t leave my room, I would put on house music and dance. This helped not only as a physical but also a creative outlet. Mostly, I would just try to love myself even when I knew I’d be better off exercising but couldn’t get out of bed.

# 2. Safety needs

**1b. Personal security** (I’m sort of combining this with Shelter which would be a Physiological need)

I withdrew on the 11th floor of a Manhattan apartment in a generally chaotic living situation. We had 7 animals, including a lorikeet. The sound of its screeching in tandem with the traffic on Broadway was almost too much to bear (I was so sensitive to sound). When I moved home to my parent’s house at months 4-5, I immediately felt relief. They live on a river and having nature around helped calm my nerves. The greenery and quiet was so soothing. (There were, however, emotional stresses in moving home, which are touched upon in ‘3c. Family’ below.)

In short, the safer, less chaotic, and more in control I felt in my environment, the easier it became to deal with the withdrawal. This is another reason why I found rehab/psych wards to be a poor place in acute. I had no control, and thus felt trapped.

**2b. Emotional security** (more on this under ‘Belongingness & love needs’ below)

I’ve found that very few people, except others who have gone through this, can ever truly understand it. To those around me, my behavior in acute made no sense. To me, I was just trying to cope with this flood of newfound emotions. Looking back, I coped poorly. If I had known of these online communities during withdrawal, I would have used them as my first line of support prior to engaging friends and family.

Even at 18 months, I’ve found benzo support Zoom meetings to be really helpful. The following are the ones I am currently aware of (please note that the first two have attendee limits):

   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/BenzoWarriorGroup/learning\_content/?filter=127229285385301&post=255259712264321](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BenzoWarriorGroup/learning_content/?filter=127229285385301&post=255259712264321)

If you are aware of other Zoom meetings, please post them below. I think, ideally, we would have at least one meeting available per day. The isolation in withdrawal can be intense, and the more we do to combat this through mutual support the better!

Lastly, I would like to mention that I found a downside to over-engaging online forums (e.g. Benzo Buddies). The more I read of other people’s anguish, the more I began to dwell on my own symptoms, and thus my net suffering increased. In the Ashton Manuel, Dr. Ashton states, “Many ‘withdrawal symptoms’ are simply due to fear of withdrawal (or even fear of that fear).” While this quote seemed a bit unsympathetic to me in acute, it is true that the less I lived in the problem (symptoms/fear) and the more I lived in the solution (healing/recovery), the better off I was. The symptoms DO pass. Positive thinking was critical.

**3b. Financial security**

I went into withdrawal with about 20 grand saved up. I now have a couple hundred (quarantine has been a huge stressor on this). While I had quit my job 3 months prior to withdrawing—the drugs made it impossible to maintain—I definitely couldn’t work in acute. It took me about 7 months into my CT to even entertain the idea of working again. I used to work at a top advertising agency; at month 10 I got a job as a barback. I’m now a server. I moved out of New York and into a small city.

At the risk of sounding too self-rationalizing, I’m actually at peace with this. I’ve managed to rebuild my life. I make enough to afford my own apartment and basic needs. While my earning potential has been slashed, I find that I’m happier working on my feet than I was in an office. There is a hurt pride element in going from the 30th floor of Manhattan office building to serving shots at a small urban bar but honestly, it’s all just so absurd and I can’t help but laugh. I’m back at work now and am enjoying it.

I know finances are hard on everyone and I wish I could help more. I’ve heard numerous stories of people going on disability while withdrawing, which is certainly worth looking into.

# 3. Belongingness & love needs

**1c. Friendships**

While my initial instinct was to reach out to close friends in my state of utter agony, I found this to be a double-edged sword. In my lack of self-awareness and poor emotional regulation, I damaged many of my most precious relationships. I was hurting people and yet, in the moment, I couldn’t realize it. In retrospect, I should’ve warned my friends ahead of time that I would be going through intense emotional changes (almost like a second puberty) and that I would appreciate their support but I wouldn’t be much myself. I might have even preferred to distance myself completely until after the first 6 months. Keep in mind I was CT; if I had tapered I imagine I could have controlled myself better.

**2c. Intimacy**

I found sex to be a great relief in terms of providing distraction, but in retrospect I made a lot of regrettable decisions while in acute. Without a steady partner, I’d tell my past self that it’s best to abstain.

**3c. Family**

I was very fortunate in that both my parents are alive and they allowed me to live at home for a bit. That being said, this came with its own challenges. Something about withdrawal made me relive childhood traumas in a very visceral way, and being around my parents caused me to lash out like a teenager. In this respect, my thoughts are similar to ‘1c. Friendships’ above.

At about month 7 I could begin handling relationships much better. Here an old AA adage rings true: “We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.” These days I’ve begun making amends for how I was in acute and am able to have happy, healthy relationships. I’m capable of empathizing and connecting again. Perhaps I can empathize even more.

# 4. Esteem needs

Before starting benzos, my mental health was shit. I was full of shame, guilt, and self-loathing. Of course, benzos made it all much worse. As I’ve been waking up from my time in the benzo blanket, I’ve been faced with the additional shame and guilt of my addiction/dependence. Why didn’t I do more research? What kind of person was I on those drugs? How could I let this happen to me? Am I a masochist?

I think withdrawing is in itself an act of self-love. Anyone that bears this level of pain and suffering has to be a fighter and has to be strong. For me, it’s been a rediscovery of who I am, like being reborn. I’ve relived every trauma and every heartbreak in the deepest chasms of soul. I still have a lot to work through, but at least now, at 18 months, I’m intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually able to do so. My general wellbeing and sense of self is eons ahead of what it was while on benzos and especially while getting off. I can finally feel, I can finally laugh, and, while I can probably finally love, I’m just happy to be able to cry for now.

# 5. Self-actualization

I would’ve laughed if you had talked to me about self-actualization while in acute because mostly I was just fighting for my life. Still, there is one thing I’d like to mention: creativity. While I struggled to find any utility in the suffering, my withdrawal did open the floodgates of inspiration so to speak. Musically, I was able to come up with things I would’ve never been able to otherwise. I couldn’t read, but I could write poems. Then I found drawing to be helpful when I couldn’t find the words to express how I was feeling. At the least, these were distractions; at the most, they helped me to reclaim my humanity after being so terribly sedated for such a long time.

I turned 25 two weeks ago. My early 20s are gone. My memories of them are hazy and foreign, as if I teleported in time from the moment I first took K. My childhood hopes and dreams are ashes. I do not write this to demoralize anyone, only to say that the sense of loss in withdrawal is perhaps the most existentially painful feeling of all. I’m healing from that too. I can now say that the further I get from the pills, the less I dwell in misery and regret and the more I live in acceptance. I’m regaining a lust for life that I never could have imagined on benzos. In a way, life is more beautiful having known the depths of hell. I’m forming new hopes and new dreams.

If anyone is struggling and wants to talk, please feel free to message me. I’ll do what I can to help, even if that just means listening. You are not alone, and every day you are healing. It just takes time. Patience is a virtue, and self-compassion is key. It gets so much better.

\*My K dose started at 1mg per day and my amphetamine prescription started at 20mg per day but within a few months these were both up to the aforementioned amounts. I also took about a half dozen emergency doses of K during my CT when the pain was unbearable.

But we're taking it a day at a time. Before tapering the attempt was made to go CT from at least 15-20mg xan daily. At least, if not far more. That was a disaster that ended in a 3 day stay in ICU and massive anxiety related to the hallucinations etc etc. 

Even now the panic attacks are terrible. But, they are absolutely manageable. I'm able to talk this person through them. Today during a bad moment of panic I mentioned to my SO that there isn't a single symptom being experienced that someone here hasn't also experienced. The similarities are so stunning, that when I'm reading through the threads I have to double check to make sure my SO hasn't actually made an account because it's almost word for word the exact same feelings and descriptions of what's happening to this person. So now our new coping mechanism to stay grounded and make it through each symptom as they come is for me to find examples of someone going through the same and read the good bits out loud. I'm basically screening them to edit out the portions that might cause more fear/paranoia and leaving the good parts about other people having the same and how it absolutely passes. Doing this today brought my SO so much relief that it actually brought them to tears. So first...I want to thank each and everyone of you here. Even those of you currently having a hard time. I know it must be horrible for you, but just know that even now no matter how horrible you feel there is at least one other person out there reading your story and finding hope on it. So keep going, because you can absolutely do this. 

Now I'm going to politely ask that those of you that can share the symptoms you've had, if you're able and it doesn't cause added anxiety. I can not properly put into words how much it has helped not only my loved one but myself as well being able to see that there are other people dealing with the same thing, that these symptoms are normal and we aren't alone. Thank you so much!!!

On a side note, the worst symptoms we are dealing with are massive anxiety centered around insomnia, the jerking that some of you get while falling asleep, the feeling of decreased intelligence, jumbling up words occassionally.... You all know. The usual. Thanks!!!",9,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9829896092414856}"

1 mg --> 0.5 mg klonopin. No issues. (This was over a year ago.)

0.5 mg --> 0.25 mg. No issues. This was about 3 months ago.

0.25 mg --> 0.125 mg. Initially no issues. Then a total meltdown.

I was in the ER twice in one week, the first time because I experienced sudden tightness in my chest that did not let up. I was convinced I was dying from COVID-19 (I did not, in fact, have COVID-19). The second time, my heart rate was going nuts, I had the shakes, and I started losing feeling in my arms and legs. I was convinced I was having a stroke. Back to the ER. Went through the rigamarole of EKG and bloodwork and X-rays for a second time. They put Ativan in an IV for me. The ER doctor said I looked really healthy. Eventually, after my shaking stopped, I asked, ""Hey, could this be because I've been tapering off Klonopin?"" 

The doctor said he didn't think that such a slow taper and such a low dose would cause such a reaction.

But seriously. That all happened because of the taper, right? Especially since the Ativan IV was the first thing that made me feel semi-normal that entire week.

Anyway, they discharged me, and I spoke to my primary care doc a few days later. He gave me a few options -- continue to stay on the 0.125 of Klonopin, switch to a low dose of librium to help me taper off benzos, or switch to an SSRI like Trazodone to help me sleep. (I should note that I originally went on the 1 mg of Klonopin for sleep issues about 4 years ago. Boy, do I regret that.) I am not sure what to do. I would like to be 100% off benzos eventually. 

I've ditched alcohol, am taking vitamin c, zinc, and magnesium supplements daily along with melatonin at night. I am down to one small cup of coffee a day from about 4 - 5 cups. I do light exercise and try to get outside in the sun for about an hour a day. And yet. I slipped today because I had a work deadline -- I took 0.25 mg of Klonopin because I couldn't type with how shaky my hands were and I was so tired of the tightness in my chest. I also live in fear of tinnitus as a side effect of all this -- my mom has the pulsatile variety (the thumping in your ear) and she nearly took her own life 10 years ago because it was so bad. So every time I have the slightest bit of ear thumping or ear pain, I flip out. 

I dunno what to do. I am thinking of switching to the librium, but is that just delaying the inevitable withdrawal symptoms? I am pretty scared of all my options. Thanks for reading.",4,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952913522720337}"

Im a 12 year opiate addict now on Suboxone with no relapse who had 4 months clean before starting a benzo run of xanax and klonopin back in the winter. This is my first and 1000000% last experience in benzo withdrawal. I had no clue what to expect. They gave me a 4 day taper of librium with temazepam at night for the first night or 2. The first week I felt fine. I didnt realize benzo withdrawal had a delayed withdrawal effect. I feel so strange like im living one of those dreams where you cant control your body. Its like im split into 2 of myself and im watching the other. I feel foggy and groggy. How long should I expect this to last? Should I still be fearful of having a seizure? Any advice appreciated.

Edit: Wow I'll add more details since I initially didn't expect this post to get much feedback. Thanks for all your advice. I'm 34. I tried benzos in my early 20s before opiate addiction took over. I have always dealt with anxiety & self-esteem issues. At the end of 2019, around Halloween I switched over from methadone and fentanyl to suboxone and have been successfully on suboxone since then. That is my drug of choice and I haven't relapsed. I think it was the end of January when I gave a friend a ride home from a NA meeting & he offered me a Klonopin in return. I still take full responsibility for accepting that pill since I knew what the consequences were. It started off with me saving the benzo use for social activities. They truly did work. However, at the end of my run, which is 2 weeks today, I was taking combined 1-4mg a day of xanax/klonopin, & sometimes Ativan to just take it. I've been in the program of NA and 3 other rehabs and knew Benzo withdrawal was no joke so I had it in the back of my mind and that healthy fear drove me to detox/rehab. The first week of detox I really didn't feel anything & then some symptoms started to kick in. I'm attending a Zoom meeting tonight and will take everyone's advice. Going to stay as active as possible, eat/drink healthy, and not pick up anything. It is one helluva strange feeling and I never want to have to go through this again.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8198456168174744}"

Hello All,

Let me first start out by saying i have been reading all the stories here, it breaks my heart and i truly wish all of you a speedy recovery and all the best in life.

Background:

in Feb i had an allergy attack (unknown at the time) and it was discovered i have EoE. I had some gastro issues for a couple weeks but they did seem to go away. I realized my body might have healed but now my ongoing gastro issues were Anxiety based as i grew a fear of throwing up in public because i throw up in the office when i was having the allergy attack. I was prescribed Xanax in Feb as a use as needed. Where i live its heavily monitored and detox centers don't exist. Your prescription is capped at 90mg per month and you cant be issued more as it will be blocked in system. I started out slow maybe .5mg to 1mg a day enjoyed the feeling of Xanax and by March/April found my self taking around 7mg on the weekends but maybe only .5mg to 1mg on the weekdays as i couldnt refill until 30 days. Some days i just skipped days altogether. I had some gastro issues and when i took a Xanax it made this go away. This was my first clue that maybe my gastro issues were gone and it was withdrawal symptoms kicking in between doses. My last refill was 25 days ago and i have only go through 40% of my Xanax. Never really thought stopping this medicine would produce such bad symptoms until a friend told me about it. Thats when i started reading and it put the fear of God into me. A friend of my also had a Seizure (doctors say it was prob heat exhaustion as its well over 100 degrees outside and we were at the pool all day.

Present Day:

I have decided to get off this medicine, stop taking Nexium (for GERD) which i dont think i have, and really cleanse the body to see why my stomach is still sensitive. I have had 3 more Endoscopes in the last 3 months and everything is a clean bill of health so i'm thinking maybe its the Xanax which is why i am stopping. I could throw all my pills away tomorrow it doesnt bother me but i realize maybe the brain could have built a dependence.

Advice Needed:

As there was no pattern to how i took my Xanax and over the past 25 days i have avg 1.5mg a day i figured i would start on .5mg a day (.25mg at 9AM and .25mg at 9PM) of Xanax. After a week cut it down by 50% and then on week 3 if possible cut it down again by 50% or just stop. So far i'm on day 5 of .25mg twice a day and its considerably less then what i was taking the past 4 months. To be honest out side of a little head fog i feel totally fine except for maybe a little nausea. nothing that impacts my daily life. 

Should i continue on the quick 2 week taper?

Will symptoms appear soon?

any advice you can give is helpful as 6 different doctors could not give me solid advice and seeing my friend have a Seizure scared the hell out of me.

I‘m a fxcked up soul since 10 years. I‘m 22 now and well, two years of my life I‘ve spent in my dark room, getting higher and higher, taking more and more meds and benzos together, day for day. No friends, pure isolation. 7 pills lorazepam daily. 

With 14-18 years I was a punkgirl, driving through the country, demonstrating for a better world, visiting friends, going to concerts and I was fxcked up, but there was life in my veins. And now? Where my life should start, I only have my dog and playing videogames all day. 


This addiction made me numb. I don’t feel anything 80% of my life. When I feel , there’s only anger, fear and sadness.

I was clean for like 4 months, but now... relapse after relapse. 

My boyfriends loves me, my friends do that too, but idc about that often. Love was meaningful to me once. When I feel it today, it scares me, because these feelings are too strong. 

Everything lost colors and I don’t know what to do anymore. Everything is meaningless and I’m just waiting for my life to end. I don’t want this life, but I don’t know how to bring back emotions in my life. I’m in therapy, taking new happy pills, but it doesn’t help, urgh

It's as if my mental energy quota has been reduced to 1/10 compared to my normal conditions.

Thinking too much or doing too much stuff in a row that demands logic makes me enter in a 'overheat mode' which makes my right temple with a feeling of burning, making me less capable of exercising logical thoughts and making me feel mentaly exhausted.

Once I reach this state it's debilitating and I can't work or even sustain a normal conversation: I need to have a time without thinking so what I usually do is to lay in my bed and do nothing but breathing and trying to relax, or to meditate.

Yesterday I reached this point simply by playing a 2 hour online boardgame and seems that I am still mentally exhausted from yesterday. I fear for my job. 

If I keep on going working thinking too much and ignoring this feeling I get racing non-stop thoughts, high BP and weird sensations that makes me think I am having a stroke.

I am now still with this right temple burning... is not exactly a pain feeling but still something very noticeable and I am still mentally exhausted to the point that I don't even want to try to watch TV.

Has anyone here ever gone through this?

Drank daily for about a decade and blacked out nightly.  Wanted to stop and self prescribed etizolam to get through the withdrawal. Was clean for over a month from everything. Felt amazing hate myself for getting back into this shit.

Always used alcohol for anxiety and sleep and after a couple weeks was feeling better. 

6 months ago I started again. Was at a party and doing fine without drinking but had some coke that sent me into a panic and I dug through my stuff and found that sweet relief in the etizolam.

I couldn't say how often I was using alcohol and etizolam which I know isn't helpful but it was one night  to black out from alcohol every 3 or 4 days and etizolam to deal with the hangover the next day. Up to 10mg. For 4 months. 

Had a change at work and I got on the schedule I'm currently on. Work Monday through Thursday. 

I drink to a black out Thursday after work and wake up Friday start drinking again till another blackout and usually do the same Saturday night. Sunday is just benzo abuse out of control. Have stashes of etizolam, alprazolam, clonazepam and diazepam. They  barely get me through and I have to use whatever self control I can muster to not just keep popping until I pass out/blackout. Last Sunday I had 9mg of xanax. Today, Sunday, I've had 70mg of valium and 2mg of klonopin. It feels like just enough to get me through the day without losing it. I wake up Monday feeling great and don't get any withdrawal symptoms but always end up drinking again Thursday night and repeating the cycle. When using benzos just once a week does that mean the alcohol is increasing my tolerance? Seems like I'd have withdrawals during the work week since using doses once a week. The Ashton manual doesn't seem to have info on a situation exactly like this so was hoping for advice. Any stories, comments or advice is much appreciated.

I feel like the Ativan made this hypersensitivity way way worse, but I know I am super sleep deprived too. I never had this happen before which is freaking me out and why I want to get off ASAP. My plan is 0.5mg of Ativan for the next two nights, 0.25 for 2-3 nights and be off.

Tried AA earlier in my life and had a bad experience so this time I got the help of a psychiatrist, lets call him drB.  Right away drB recommended that i take ativan 1mg x 4 x day...4mgs total.  I pushed back for about a month and finally caved.  I had been using Ativan sporadically for things like public speaking, presentations at work  etc.  And to put me to sleep whenever I got home from a nightclub with my friend Molly .... drinking more water than alcohol ;;)  Never abused ativan it was literally a tool for me to cope and abuse alcohol and other drugs.  i take thc edibles to this day a couple times a week to unwind FYI

*sorry just think i should address the AA thing.... AA is a fantastic program and has saved lives of friends colleagues  of mine I just couldn't do it.  I grew up with an alcoholic father who took me to friday night meetings when i was a young lad.  i hated it ...would crawl around in the bowels of the church while he was in the circle sharing.  I just can't shake my negative connotations of the program, so goes my bad relationship with alcohol.  its was my drug of choice and loved it.  I always dabbled in drugs coke, molly but never wanted those things until i had a few cocktails and then occasionally(maybe monthly) we would call 'the butcher'  our nickname for drug dealers.*  

I had read about the dangers on long term benzo use but drB assured me when the time came we would 'land the plane' and ween myself off the drug.  I ended up doing exactly that but if I knew then what I know now I probably would have passed....maybe.  The reason I say maybe is because it helped me to get alcohol out of my life and from that perspective I am grateful.  its my story, my journey so please know that i am not suggesting benzos are a good thing and I think my story will speak for itself.  

Benzos were a welcome relief 4 months into being alcohol free.  they allowed me function at work, sleep and not be an absolute nightmare around my family.  All was well for about 3 years then year 4 I began to become what I was trying to avoid...grumpy, angry, ..typical dry drunk behavior again.  the stories i read here helped me to decide it was time to get this shit out of my life.  So i was cruising at 10,000 feet and I had to land this miserable piece of shit .... so for 2 years i began the decent.  For the entire time I was angry that I ever got started because its was a challenge.  Based on everything i have read I would be a 6.5 out of 10 in terms of the severity of my withdraws(10 being the worst).  sometimes a 10.5 and most of the time a 5 or 6. 

My 2 year Taper from 4mg day ativan.  Although i consulted the Ashton my taper was not super structured.  The slower the better IMHO.  Anytime i tried to speed things up I got to a pretty dark place.   

This is my approximate timeline(remember i didn't keep a journal) and everything was split into 4s brk, lunch, dinner, bedtime. That how I always took it regardless of the dose...until the very end.  OOO ya and i did bigger cuts at the beginning which was the easy part, the little cuts near the end was absolute hell.  So in my experience if you want to move faster do it at the beginning, at the end baby steps.

4mg to 3mg - 4 weeks to normalize and stay here for about 2 months - 1mgBrk, 0.5Lunch, 0.5dinner, 1mg bed

3mg to 2mg - 4 weeks to normalize and stay here for about 3 months 

This is where I went with Baby steps and only moved forward when i felt like i could handle it...drB kept reminding me that there is no rush 1 year 2 year 3 years who cares.  during this period forward i never really normalized.  I was just varying degrees of fuuukd but functional.

2mg to 1.5mg - 2 months -  0.5mgBrk, 0.5mid afternoon, 0.5 bed

Then i got a pill cutter and started cutting my 0.5 ativans into halves

1.5 to 1mg - 3 months -    .25mgBrk, 0.25Lunch, 0.25dinner, .25mg bed

I was absolutely miserable, depressed, hated my life, even my wife, thought i didn't love her anymore. I caved and went back to 2mg a day and felt relief.  It was more important that I didnt drink and extend my taper.  drB and I talked about it ...so 2mg a day for a few months and began my final taper to this day as follows...

2mg to 1.5mg - 6months -  0.5mgBrk, 0.5mid afternoon, 0.5 bed

1.5 to 1mg - 3 months -    .25mgBrk, 0.25Lunch, 0.25dinner, .25mg bed

drB switched me to diazepam at this point 

1mg ativan to 4mg diazepam - drBsaid a switch from one to the other should be fine and I have read on  this community others saying the same thing...everyone is different tho...for me it was fine and made the switch overnight to 4mg Diaz for about 4 weeks to make sure.

Then i tapered by 1mg diaz every 4 to 6 weeks as follows....

3mg diaz - 4 to 6 weeks

2mg diaz 4 to 6 weeks

1 mg diaz about 2 months 

June 1st 2020 no more benzos 

I felt the same during the entire diazepam taper.  lets say 6.5 out of 10.  I was still worried I didn't love my wife still...grumpy but i held strong.  I had read so many stories here that it gets better so i did my best to just go with the flow at home and at work.  I am 40 days benzo free and I feel great!!!

about a 2 weeks ago a wire in my 54 year old brain must have reconnected or something and have started to feel like my old self...like when i was younger and I love my wife BTW.  my anger has subsided ...its not perfect but this is the first taste of normalcy ...whatever that is ?

I am alcohol free, benzo free.  I still use edibles once maybe twice a week as they really make me relaxed ...  i need the mental break but again we are all different and only time will tell.

That's my story.  thanks to anyone and everyone who is in this community you have been a massive help.  I have to thank drB because he got me off the booze, was amazing to talk to and fully supported my taper.  I will report back regardless of how things go but for now onward and upward.

OOO Yaaaa covid was a blessing for me.  used the time working from home to make the final decent onto the runway.  My thoughts and prayers do go out to everyone who is negatively affected.

I am down to about .23 mg. Right now, I am having no withdrawal symptoms because I have been on .23 for a few months. I’m planning on buying a nice scale before I cut down because it’s hard to accurately taper such a small dose. 
Anyways, I have heard so many different things about drinking. For instance, my doctor said “you’re on such a small dose of klonopin that it would be fine to have a glass of wine or beer.” I have also read that you shouldn’t drink when you’re having withdrawal symptoms. So does this mean you can drink a beer or two while on benzodiazepines as long as you’re not currently in a withdrawal period. Like rn for instance, I’m not have withdrawals but I will after I make my next cut.

Okay also, I have heard that you cannot drink at all when tapering benzos and even for a few years after benzos. I read a post by one man who said he drank a year after quitting klonopin and it messed him up. He said he started getting withdrawal symptoms again and felt crazy. Is this true?? Someone else posted “I’ve accepted that I cannot drink for the rest of my life.” Implying year after quitting benzos, alcohol can mess up your GABA years after ??

So what’s the deal here? Has anyone had anyone drunken while tapering in benzos? (Not heavy drinking, just a beer). And has anyone tried drinking after quitting benzos? What happened?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973161816596985}"

I've read the Ashton manual and dont have access to a doctor willing to switch me to valium, and, I'm not even sure if its necessary, because I'm already on such a low dose.

About 5 years ago I blew through 100 1mg ativan in a month, then went cold turkey. At that time I didn't know any better, and suffered pretty bad withdrawal, but no seizures. 

After that I abused alcohol for 4 years, heavily, and when I quit I chose to detox at the ER, because my insurance covered it, however, it was a rough detox, since they kick you out once your stable, then you return when your on the verge of DTs again.

Since then I've been sober from alcohol 100%. But starting about 6 months ago I got a script for ativan as needed, 1 mg. For 2 months I took about 2 a week, being careful this time. But I noticed ativan has harsh rebound due to short half life.

So 4 months ago I switched to klonopin. My doctor is a bit wacky and accidentally prescribed 2mg pills, but knowing better I cut them in 4s and take 0.5 mg.

The first month I was reasonable, taking 0.5mg twice a week. But 3 months ago I came to visit my girlfriend in the Philippines and got stuck here on lockdown thanks to COVID.

Being in a foreign country, stressed from the pandemic and losing my job, I took 0.5 every day for a month, then 0.5 every other day since then, with 1.5mg days once a week roughly. 

So on average, 0.5mg every other day for 3 months now. But struggling with this system, I've started taking 0.25 daily to make it more steady.

4 days now with daily 0.25mg, and starting to feel sick and anxious. Sorry for the long back story, but I felt past abuse may better explain my concerns of kindling possibly. 

Anyway, here's my questions...

Am I tapering correctly, doing 0.25mg daily for a week then reducing ect..?

Am I taking this too seriously, and am close to a jumping off point already?

Is it expected to feel withdrawal through the whole tapering process?

If I feel withdrawal is too overwhelming, should I slightly increase my dose and stabilize for a week? This one is difficult for me, how can I tell if its major withdrawal or my normal anxiety?

TLDR, just read the 4 questions above.

I used to be able to go to the ER and get ativan scripts for a week supply when my doctor was out of town but since changing to state insurance they treat you like a drug seeking junky. So yea even after going to a psychiatrist office they refused to help me. They offered me carbamazepine but it obviously didn’t do shit. I had to ask for gabapentin  and propranolol which they gave me bc they are too stupid and geriatric to know gabapentin is an addictive substance also soon to be scheduled like lyrica(pregabalin) which is a stronger and easier to abuse gabapentinoid. Phenibut is also a gabapentinoid.

They weren’t interested in my risk of seizures and death they just offered things that help anxiety that aren’t narcotics. Shit is insane.


After a week I went back to the ER saying my symptoms were getting worse and the doctor groped me which the rest of the staff made fun of me. I had had enough and thought their psych unit would have to taper me so I got myself voluntarily committed. After three days I felt I couldn’t breath and hadn’t slept a wink. The psychiatrist who couldn’t speak English asked me a bunch of pointless questions...one being “what age did you become sexually active” as though he was trying to diagnose me with mental illness when I was there for benzo withdrawal induced suicidal ideation and the epitome of fear.

They gave me a mirror so it looked like I wasn’t in the machine and someone stood near me the whole time but it was really bad.  At the end, the technician recommended that if I ever had to have an MRI or similar test again, I get a mild sedative like Ativan from my doctor.

I took Klonopin for 10 years and have been off for about a year and a half.  I did take a couple doses last August in a period of horrible anxiety, I’m not sure if it helped or hurt because I had a lot going on then.

i have an addictive personality, coupled with childhood trauma, and very underdeveloped impulse control. i've been taking benzos and abusing them for about 4+ years now? 

the real reason i've chosen to get off them for REAL, for LIFE, permanently, not just tapering and getting back on them a few months later bc i'm weak, but REALLY REALLY end my relationship with them, is purely because i am getting old. i'm turning 25 soon and i've noticed that my body doesn't heal the way it used to when i was a teenager. i can feel my body functions weakening, as in, if i have a hangover, i'll be hungover for a good 3 days before i finally feel less nauseous, as opposed to my teenage years where i'd spend an afternoon in bed and feel better by dinnertime. if i get a cut, or i bruise, it takes weeks for it fully scab and recover, rather than the cut disappearing in 2 - 3 days.    
i think all young adults can relate to this. 

the thing with benzos is that even if you want a good healthy sustainable relationship use with them... most are addictive, no matter the kind. i've had clonazepam, bromazepam, lorazepam, diazepam, xanax, valium (not a fan), and right now i'm trying [Oxazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxazepam) which according to my doctor, is a weaker less intense version (they know about my tendency to abuse drugs).   
i've set up a system to reduce risk of binges or benders. limited to 1 pill a day for the next month, and 4 emergency pills for safe keeping (kept for the really bad episodes) and see how well i can follow through (and not take 30 in under a week)   


i'll be posting updates on how i've done by the end of the week if anyone's interested. i want to feel normal, and have that normal be my default mode. i'm tired of losing my memories, i'm tired of feeling stupid and ashamed of the things i barely remember doing. i'm tired of numbing my personality and my ambitions and i'm tired of not feeling. feelings are terrifying and that's sort of why i got hooked on these, because i'm afraid of EVERYTHING. but no more.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988492727279663}"

i used to drink too and other stuff but i stopped drinking and etc.

i had a bad acid trip (did acid too many times in a short period of time) and i had problems with my heart in that trip. the following day i started taking clonazepam to cope with my lasting simptons. i couldn't smoke weed, i would feel light headed and have a fast heart beat.

I been taking clonazepam daily till i ran out and got valium, started at 5mg and went to 30mg very fast to obviously get a high off it or at least know i would not have heart attacks during my weed sessions.

i met a girl who started using benzos too and we drinked a little bit along with the valium, pretty good days i must say. but that had a cost. i was on almost 30mg of diazepam every day.

they changed my script one day to alprazolam when i ran out of valium and i felt bad the next day.

then i got valium again but i noticed i was doing more damage to my brain than really making it heal.

i decided to stop valium, and in the day after i only took 0.5 clonazepam.

i been on these benzos for almost 2 months now, i felt completely normal and safe while on them. but i know these feelings are fake and will be rebounded to me in the future, so i really hate benzos now. i just won't go cold turkey because of the serious issues i would probably have, as i am not mentally stable and not very healthy when is about my heart or mind.

the days following i felt pretty bad, my skin would start to burn in my neck and arms, even if i took that amount of clonazepam. these simptoms fade when i take diazepam, today, i think is the 5th day i decided to stop this meds and only 7,5mg of valium took these feelings away (today).

i decided to taper to lesser any damage i could probably make if i sticked to my hate i got from these meds. i realized after the bad trip i actually did not gave time to my brain to heal from the bad trip and then i started benzos.

i want to taper off this shit, but i really need some advices.

i am afraid of panic attacks, seizuring, hallucinations, etc etc, even more because of that bad trip.

how should i taper from this valium now? to avoid proctrated withdrawals, and brief my suffering?

i know i will feel pretty bad tapering off and even more after stopping it, so i really want to know the best way to taper off with less withdrawals possible.

i am only 18 years old, i will be 19 at next january and i don't want to be nineteen being a complete messed up mind freak.

as i said, it's been 5 days since i stopped taking huge amounts, i felt bad since, but i won't take the benzo again at that dosage. i am sticking to the lower dosages possible to cope with tolerance withdrawals.

as i said, today i had to take 7,5mg of valium to get rid of burning skin and etc.

i would even micro taper if it really helps.

is it true that, the slower i taper, the less withdrawals i get?

i want to know about tapering withdrawals and how withdrawals would be when i jump off this medication,are 2 months a good time to schedule a taper from here and jump at the end of the month while on 0.5 valium? or does it take more time to know if i adapted to these minimal doses?

i want to be safe enough to jump off the medication without seizures, without panic attacks, without developing parkinson's, etc etc.

i will be very very very thankful for anyone who answers my doubts. <3

hope u all are doing fine, and for those struggling to get off or to keep off, remember, one day it will simply be our past, and nothing else. until that day, we must live the present as warriors.
