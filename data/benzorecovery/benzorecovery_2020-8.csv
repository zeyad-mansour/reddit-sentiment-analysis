Longest I have been sober in 10 years.,"I almost don't want to post this because I feel so undeserving and feel like I should wait till I have more sobriety under my belt. But I just thought I would share the fact I am completely free of xanax (and suboxone but irrelevant to this subreddit.) 100% as of 45 days ago today. Every other time I did this I broke by week 3. I am proud to say I have pushed through.

For anyone else that may be struggling right now reading this, let me tell you it gets better. It does. I promise you. I have had the most genuine feelings of happiness these past few weeks. I still struggle. And you will too. We all do. But we have to take the good with the bad.

Love you guys. You have all been so supportive and helpful with all your posts here. It fills me with such joy. <3

It helped immediately with the anxiety, but any time I tried to taper off the benzo, the anxiety was terrible and I aborted.

Last fall, I hit some sort of terrible, depressive low, and wound up being on a medical leave for months. During this time, I changed my meds and was diagnosed (at age 39) with ADHD, which had never been on the radar before (won't get into that, but the treatment for that was what I had needed all my life and was hiding, and has turned things around for me). I also started, very slowly, to taper off the clonazepam in January, ending in May. Because I didn't have to be at work, I was able (even though it was hell) to ride it out until I was off it.

Not very long after I was off clonazepam, I started on my ADHD medication (Concerta, essentially long-acting Ritalin); this is why I'm not sure if the symptoms I'm noticing are related to that or to the benzo withdrawal.

The main problem is body focused repetitive behaviors (skin picking and hair pulling in particular). I'd had these for years, but starting in May, the severity went through the roof.

I've talked to my psychiatrist, and he says that Concerta can exacerbate tic-like behavior, but isn't sure re trichotillomania etc. And I'd assumed it was the Concerta all along, until it dawned on me that I had two variables in play and the BFRBs picked up after the benzodiazepine cessation, too. Two variables, then.

Also of interest is that the BFRBs are worst at night, when my ADHD medication has worn off. 

I wondered if anyone has experienced trichotillomania, dermatillomania (sp?) etc after going off benzos long term. 

Thank you :)

Anyway I have been trying to use diclazepam to taper but then I can across a thread about FlubromazePAM and it’s wonderful half life. 

Do you think I could stop the clonazolam and flubromazolam cold turkey and switch to just a single dose of FLubromazePAM every other day? This person in this other thread said it would work but I mean it was just a one off thread I came across a few days ago.

Also how long do you think it'll take me to taper off benzos?,"I've read of a Redditor saying he stopped breathing & had to be revived after taking 10mg of Xanax, tho I forget his tolerance level. Peaking on 1mg Clonazolam,  4mg Xanax, & 1.2mg Etizolam rn, though 45 mins ago I took 200mg of caffeine to keep me up.

I have a high benzo tolerance, unfortunately. I use them 24hrs on, 24hrs off, meaning 12am is game time, then I stop at 12am (& on off days I take Pregabalin, which is somewhat similar to Xan but acts on calcium channels, not also GABA-B like Phenibut or GHB or GABA-A like benzos).

However I've been told there will be mild cross tolerance between benzos & GABApentinoids (& more cross-tolerance between benzos & Phenibut or GHB), so I will experience mild-moderate wds, as I've been doing this for 8 months, since January. I'll be good tonight thanks to caffeine, but I know I need to stop this.

**How long do you think it'll take me to taper off benzos?** I use 2mg of Clonazolam, ~12mg of Xanax, & occasionally 1.5-4.5mg of Etizolam every 24 hours, then 750mg of Pregabalin every other 25 hours.

About Therapy:

Going to therapy to try to work through my anxiety & get off benzos, but have to find a new therapist, as my last one told me I was stupid & ""irrational"" for using any drug, including weed, ever, & that I needed to hear that! For it is ""irrational"" to knowingly use drugs that could damage your brain or organs. Lol he said weed is ""irrational"" to smoke because the tar damages your lungs, tho he conceded on edibles.

But he didn't like when I brought up how football players & boxers knowingly risk developing CTE, & how extreme sport athletes take a more extreme risk than me, & how lots of things in life are fun *because* they're dangerous. He also HATED when I brought up MAP's study using psilocybin to treat end-of-life anxiety in terminally ill patients with, I believe, a 70-80% success rate, & how they want to ultimately legalize psychedelics for medicinal use by specially trained therapists.

She really wanted me to do an inpatient 4 day detox, because that is her bread and butter, but I am scared of such an aggressive approach. I can't imagine being pumped with gabapentin, phenobarb, seroquel and others for 4 days would be anything less than psychosis inducing. I have very physical panic attacks where I go fully numb for about an hour and feel very unsafe in my mind--I'd rather try tapering at home, I'll be the first person she has ever tried this on, she thinks tapers don't work and would not switch me to Valium? She has never heard of Dr. Ashton....

My WD was awful at times for sure I won’t sugar coat it... the insomnia, the irritability, the burning skin, the depersonalization, the crying, the muscle weakness, the rebound anxiety and the diarrhea was all completely awful. But not as awful as I feel for waiting so long to get off these bastards. 

I was terrified by the horror stories and prepared for the worst, I have quit alcohol (3 handles a week) , cocaine (1g/day), Oxy (60-90mg/day) and Kratom (14g-2oz/day) so I am well versed in withdrawals and have done them unassisted and cold turkey in the past. This time I tapered but eventually relapsed during COVID and quick tapered but pretty much CT. 

My story: I started taking a variety of benzos in 2008 after a series of traumatic deaths in my family and friends that were close. Eventually I was up to 2 mg four times a day at the worst of it for about 3 to 4 years and for the past six years I have been on anywhere from 2 to 4 mg of Klonopin every night.

I decided to quit about eight months ago and started to taper down from 4 mg eventually to .5. Then came Covid and I started abusing bars both Mexican and Street presses and then eventually on to research chemicals like Etiz and Flualp. 

I made the decision to quit 2 1/2 weeks ago and worked my way down from 4 mg of Xanax a night to .5 mg over a series of three days then went CT. 

The first week was very rough with hardly any sleep, burning skin, rushes of anxiety and aches and pains all over. The physical symptoms are mostly gone 2nd week with the exception of the burning skin and achy feeling lasting to this day (day 21) however my sleep has returned to the best it has been in 12 years and can’t get enough of it. 

To overcome the discomfort at night are used homemade high dose THC capsules. They helped me to overcome the insomnia as well as provide some comfort at night to sleep. And now I’m working on cutting marijuana out of my life as well.

An interesting case of benzo withdrawal.,"I found this community while searching for some answers after getting a personal glimpse of how hard this struggle can be. My heart breaks for anyone affected by benzos. I was far too ignorant before.

My mom has been prescribed the medication for many years (10 + at least). Recently there was in increase in the amount of her filled prescription (seemingly in error but I'm still piecing that together). 50% increase for three straight months. What's baffling is that she went off the benzos for around 4 days without telling anyone, then I stepped in to control the dosage in a practically religious fashion. Normal morning and evening dosage without fail. 6 days into that 'normal' phase, she began having seizures, confusion, memory loss, etc. We're on 3 ER trips and she's in the hospital for the 2nd stay in less than a week's time.

I wanted to share but also to ask if anyone has ever heard/seen such severe withdrawals persist even 10ish days back on regular dosage. Hopefully some sort of taper plan is put in place but even with that, we honestly seem to have baffled some doctors.

TL;DR: Short benzo cold turkey, back on benzos for a week, then withdrawals set in and persist.

Thank you for reading.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Dosage info prior to 3 months ago. alprazolam , 1mg in the morning, 1mg evening. Last three months before my intervention at least that dosage plus and extra 1mg tablet on average, possibly more. 

EDIT 2: I have no doubt it started out somewhat intentional and MAYBE dosage spiraled further due to her own error or memory at a point,  but that's not my concern in the immediate future. We may have to address what led to it when she's able to comprehend the larger chunk of time.

EDIT 3: she was discharged today. Her confusion level is through the roof but I’m at least hopeful a taper is in place. Far too aggressive in my opinion, going to consult the Ashton Manual as someone suggested. May adjust to something appropriate until we see the psychiatrist Thursday. Thanks again for the replies.

The same as many, I was started on benzos for panic attacks and just kind of stuck with them. When I moved I got a new psychiatrist. We never really “connected” but I see a therapist I have a great relationship with still via telehealth so I never was concerned until recently about a lack of support in my psychiatric care. In August I wanted to taper from 60 1mg pills to 30 pills, which has been incredibly difficult. I’ve felt a little withdrawal-y some days If I haven’t taken any by the evening. This is great as I’m not noticing a craving until then, but I feel shameful that I’m dependent in any capacity. I’ve worked with my therapist a lot to “own” this shame and reframe it, especially given my increase in panic from COVID, a huge work conflict, moving... trying to not feel shameful in general about my depression/anxiety/life. I can’t eat at work because I’m so panicky i gag. So I’ll starve until the evening. I’m making do with less klonopin but it is ROUGH. Anyways, I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and after another antidepressant adjustment, I asked for like 5 extra pills as a buffer, to know I won’t go through withdrawals, etc. He said no, which I get, but how he said no came off really insensitive. He told me I “wouldn’t have a seizure no matter what” and belittled my feelings. He said if I did feel withdrawal I would need to admit to the hospital for detox. Not to mention I work at said hospital/hospital system as my psychiatrist so I see detox, labels going on patients EVERY DAY. Someone smokes pot once a week and has a “cannabis use disorder”, tries cocaine once while younger and has a “history of drug use”. ITS SO NEGATIVE. Also, at the end of July, my asshole boss disclosed my anxiety disorder on a Skype call with 100ppl on it which my psychiatrist KNOWS about. It’s creepy. In TN you can refill a controlled substance on day 28 with pharmacist consent. One month I tried to do this and for no reason she could give me, the pharmacist wouldn’t refill. Don’t get me wrong, I UNDERSTAND that I need to get off klonopin. But I don’t know how to move forward now that I have this belief that I’m labeled as a drug seeker in the Vanderbilt health system. With providers in Colorado, I’ve always been met with compassion and had a “work together” relationship vs teacher/student. Is this a regional thing? Is this just this dude? Idk you guys, I’m not sure what to think and I’m so so shameful and stressed. My partner doesn’t quite get it.

Follow up:

I went to the doctor Saturday, because this feels nothing like the withdrawal from Xanax and Klonopin. Seems like I've hit some perfect shitstorm. 

Accourding to him I've been coming down with something like hyperthermia. Which probably manifested itself more easily because of the stress and withdrawal. The symptoms are more or less exactly as I'm experiencing them: the really profound feeling of having a concussion, memory loss, being confused/garbled thoughts, really edgy, feeling nauseous and feverish, puking and very tired... All the good stuff. No corona, blood is pretty good, so I slapped myself a bit with a large trout and have been going for long walks ever since (up to 15K) and started doing push- and pullups at home again.

This is my very first post so I hope that's allowed. And I'm in a bad way because I haven't really slept in a week and I only realized why last night. I've known for awhile that Klonopin is to be avoided like the plague, unfortunately my doctor has been prescribing 1mg/night to me for my insomnia for about 4 years now, and I was addicted before I even knew it was addictive. Now I switched to working nights and my insomnia is worse than ever, so I talked to my doctor and he gave me a prescription for Ambien. He didn't mention what to do about the Klonopin AND he told me Ambien is a benzo, so I figured I'd switch to Ambien and finally ditch the Klonopin. Obviously that was a really bad move. I went from taking 1mg/day to maybe 3mg last week, and I am all kinds of messed up. I haven't slept more than 30 minutes/day in a week, and I feel so awful that I'm afraid I'm going to lose my new job because I'm such a mess and I can't perform without shaking and twisting my neck to try and relieve the constant cramping and essentially twitching and clenching my jaw like a total addict ... which I just realized I am. Now I don't know what to do. I took 1mg yesterday to try and alleviate the symptoms, along with the Ambien and I actually slept a few hours. But I don't want to get hooked on yet another drug, and I would prefer death to the way I've been feeling for the past week. It's almost enough to just throw in the towel and just take Klonopin until I die. I'm sorry this is so long.

Luckily, I never use it during the day and I usually only take 0.25 to 0.5 mg a night.  However, I find that if I don’t take it before I go to bed, it’s hard to sleep.  The problem is that my psychiatrist doesn’t seem to acknowledge that there is any problem.  As long as I’m not overdosing or coming in early to get more tablets he doesn’t seem to think taking Xanax for a prolonged period of time is a big problem.  I could see a different psychiatrist who is more open to getting off Xanax, although it’s a little harder since I live in a non-English speaking country and not all doctors speak English all that well.  So I hope to convince my doctor that I probably should get off Xanax (especially since I  was initially supposed to be on it for the short term.)

Thanks in advance for reading. So I started self medicating with benzos (mostly Xanax) about a year and a half ago due to stress/anxiety from work. Like most, at first it was incredible and worked wonders. Over time, my tolerance has steadily been creeping up and I’ve found myself breaking my promises and using recreationally, multiple days in a row, multiple doses daily, it’s losing its magic, anxiety is worse when not on, etc. 

My tolerance is now at the point I can take two full bars and be properly barred but not black out/pass out even when mixing with alcohol. I’ve accumulated a huge stash of pharma Xanax that I’ve given my girlfriend to keep in a safe place and not give me unless it’s an emergency. 

I thought about just quitting altogether but I’m at the point now that on my days off I feel uncomfortable and anhedonic about everything so I am scared to just stop especially since I need to function and perform at work. 

I have 500 mg of Valium (50 10 mg blues) that I have also saved up and my plan after doing some research was to do a month long taper starting at 20mg and dropping 5mg per week. I started this yesterday and it is bearable but not very comfortable (I guess that is how a taper should feel?)

My biggest question is am I making a mistake by going from non daily but regular and heavy use/abuse to a smaller and controlled but daily taper schedule? 

Also, is my taper too short? I don’t want to drag this out but I also don’t want to be miserable. 

One last thing: Valium doesn’t seem to be doing much for my actual anxiety but I’m sure it is helping me stave off bad withdrawal that I would be having otherwise. I miss the instant relief of Xanax and the euphoric head high. Valium is mostly just making me sleepy and at this dose I’m getting zero euphoria (which is fine) I just hope the drowsy effect goes away if I stick to this taper. 

Should I stick with this plan? Or do you think I should try and take some days off completely to see how I react? I may be able to secure more vals for a longer taper but that is not guaranteed so this is my current plan.

Started a strategy, would be very thankful for some opinions and input.","I initally started taking 1mg a day of lorazepam because I had high anxiety and suddenly had 5-10 really painful panic attacks a day. Doctor prescribed me that stuff for months and I started psychotherapy. The therapist said that Benzos and therapy don't work well together and he made a plan to taper me off. By the time I had been addicted for 6 months, 1,5mg daily. I was supposed to reduce my dosage 0,25mg every week for 6 weeks. That failed because I got withdrawals and found out that alcohol helps pretty well with it. The less benzos I took the more alcohol I drank. It took my fear of sudden death and panic attacks away. In my fear I managed to source an infinite amount of lorazepam and just thought fuck it, I will stop drinking and just take the benzos at least I can function that way. Pretty quickly I found out that the Benzos didn't even work without the alcohol and I needed both substances in my system. As you may already have guessed, I completely messed up my Gaba. I have been taking 2mgs of lorazepam and 5 beers daily for 2 months just to feel somewhat normal. A couple of days ago I made the decision that I do not want to keep living being addicted to such a degree. So my plan is: Quit alcohol cold turkey and just take as many benzos as it takes to feel somewhat ok and if my body stops craving alcohol then I will taper down the lorazepam or at least make it work on its own in lower dosages again. I'm currently on day 5 of no alcohol. The price I have to pay for this is to take 5-6mg of lorazepam over the course of the day. What do you guys think about that? Any estimation when the alcohol cravings stop and I can get onto the next problem (lorazepam) with a really slow taper?

Most information I've found online seems to be related to long-term and not short-term.

I was put on Xanax at .5 mg in mid June, and that seemed to be fine until a few weeks ago when I started developed tolerance withdrawal, though I didn't realize it at the time. Went up to .75 mg briefly but went back down when I quickly became tolerant to that, as I was wary of going any higher.

However, last Monday my withdrawal got so bad that I was losing the will to live and I went to the ER. While I was there I was given 2 mg of Ativan because of how bad my anxiety was. I was discharged and then given a prescription for 1 mg Ativan, which I am currently tapering off of. So subsequently I am going through the gamut of withdrawal symptoms for the past five days and it's been real rough. I've never experienced my body and mind being out of whack for so long.

I know that everyone's experience will be different, but I am going to have to go through this for the next two weeks while I'm tapering? It's been one hell of a limbo so far.

I’m trying to figure out a tapering schedule off Ativan.  In the past I I had usually taken 0.5mg-1mg once every couple weeks so I really was spacing it out due to only being prescribed 14 1mg for pills for as needed use.  Recently I’ve been prescribed 30 pills in a month and had started taking 0.5-1mg on an almost daily basis for about 3 weeks. I might’ve skipped a couple days here and there.  I suddenly stopped taking them a couple weeks ago and have been going through what I think is withdrawals.  Heightened anxiety, crying more often, the two main symptoms that worried me were tinnitus (ringing in ears which has mostly subsided) and Hyperacusis (everyday sounds suddenly becoming too loud).  The Hyperacusis has made me really stressed though I think it might be slowly improving. Has anyone else experience this symptom during withdrawal? 

I wasn’t on some big dose for too long so I’m wondering the best way to go about tapering. Right now my plan is to take 0.5 every few days and then each week take a smaller piece off (maybe 10-15% of that dose) as each week passes.  I’ve also thought of taking it daily but just slowly taking less and less each day till it runs out. My withdrawal symptoms don’t seem very severe and do seem better from a couple weeks ago but I just wanted others input of tapering off a lower dose 3 week stint of Benzos.

I didn’t know where else to post this and honestly, the lingering anxiety has me questioning a lot of things. I stopped taking Xanax about a month ago cold turkey (not by choice, but because the pills I was getting weren’t as strong as my normal dose). Immediately, I went into a state where I was hallucinating every hour of the day, every second. I was imagining people sexually harassing me, shooting at my house; imagined my own death multiple times, my boyfriend abandoning me, and that my cat (who passed away in May this year) was walking around, alive.  This torturous cycle lasted eight days, and I couldn’t eat, drink much, or swallow anything. Once I was in that state I couldn’t take anything to take me out of it. 

When I came out of it I began eating nonstop, drank a lot of ensure and took a lot of vitamins every day to get my body back to (somewhat normal). For several weeks, I couldn’t feel my hands or my face. I eventually gained the feeling back, but occasionally I can’t feel my face at all. My heart rate increases dramatically whenever I stand up, my anxiety is almost crippling, I get headaches almost daily and migraines occasionally. Other than that I’m mostly functional, however, I’m terrified it gets worse and it’s too late to turn back. It’s been an exact month since I entered that state and a month since the last day I took a bar. Do I still have the risk of death and permanent damage? Is there any way to fix it? Any help would be appreciated.

I'm autistic with a history of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I've been on meds before, but this is undoubtedly the worst experience I've ever had.

Back in June I had to visit the ER due to an adverse reaction to restarting Lexapro where I couldn't sleep at all and had extremely heightened anxiety. They gave me some lorazepam to take at home to help me sleep, as well as a very short prescription for .5 mg of Xanax to take over the next couple of nights. (I stopped taking the Lexapro.)

However, when I told my psychiatrist about it, she decided to extend the Xanax prescription, and I feel that it was a huge mistake.  

The first month or so on the .5 mg nightly was really great, of course. It felt like I had control of the anxiety; I was sleeping well and productive as hell. But a couple of weeks ago, I could feel the anxiety creeping back, along with some lightheadedness that I had never experienced before. My psychiatrist told me to try to go up to. 75 mg, which I did for a week, and it only took a couple days to develop a tolerance this time. I went back down to .5 mg, but it was clear that something was wrong. 

In the past week or so my anxiety has completely spiraled out of control. I'll be on edge all day, and no amount of exercise, meditation, yoga, or herbal tea helps me relax. My sleep is all over the place and I wake up frequently in a panic, sometimes delirious about where I am. I'm absolutely exhausted and yet completely wired at the same time.

Finally, my anxiety and anhedonia got so bad that I became suicidal and went to the ER this past Monday. While I was admitted they gave me 2 mg of Lorazepam and I was so anxious that I was trying to fight off the effects, until it finally kicked in and I calmed down. After a psychiatric screening, they determined that I was safe to go home and discharged me with a prescription to continue the lorazepam. But I decided that I was absolutely done with benzos and I now am on a tapering plan with my psychiatrist.

Of course... now I'm in the middle of benzo withdrawal and it is absolutely one of the worst things I've gone through. What is the most maddening is that I've never abused drugs or alcohol before in my life, never been addicted to anything but food and video games, and yet just two months of this med has ruined me.

I'm no longer trying antidepressants and while I would like to discontinue Klonopin too, for the time being I'd be happy to get my dose back to .5 in the AM and .5 in the PM again (the normal anxiety/panic doseage).

I've read various guides, etc...  Can anyone with experience answer this (the best you can).

Would going from 2.5 a day total down to 1.5 a day total be too big of a first cut? Should I level at 2 first? If it isn't dangerous (seizures, I've never had one in my life), I'd like to do the big cut.  However, I don't want to risk my health.

Just wanted to share that the fear of withdrawal can be just as, even more intense, than withdrawal itself. Before I go climbing (esp after work), I tend to feel shaky and ill, like my body is telling me not to go in public. My fiancée brings the bottle song with us just in case, but upon arrival I always feel better.

Just wanted to share some positive news. Even with 7 years of being on this stuff and 2 of being at a high 2+mg per day dose, it’s possible to taper without intense side effects. Just wanted to put this on here since there is so much fear, negative experiences, and otherwise shared that shaped my view of what withdrawal is actually like.

I took 15 mg over a period of 7 days so about 2 mg a day. I know its to much.  I was hurting to hard.   Today I wanted to stop because my ear infection is getting better but I keep getting panic attacks.  I was hoping i could stop the benzo without issue after a week but I guess not.  I also was on a short pain medication. Doctor gave me 4 days worth of tramadol for the pain to get trough the days before the antibiotics could start working.  So now I'm not taking any pain medication, the infection is clearing the pain is less each day.  But today I started sweating and thinking irrationally and panicking. I had to go to the neighbours for help ( i live by myself) before I realized it was probably because of the xanax.

What should I do?  White knuckle trough it our taper?  How should i taper? I just took 1/4 of 1 mx xanax to calm to to be able to type this.   How much at what frequency?  Thanks for any advise you can give me.",1,"{'infect': 3, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75651157}"

I want to share the last 7 years of my life and how xanax has effected me. It all started i guess my senior year of hs. i got a pretty bad shoulder injury and ended up having surgery. It wasnt until then that i realized how much fun and how much i enjoyed getting fucked up. Anyways, fast forward exactly one year. Now im in college and found a legit fucking vendor that lived in the dorm next to me. I woke up two states away. Absolutely no idea where i was or how i got there. i remember calling my best friend because i owed the dude $300 for TWO days worth of xanax. He bailed me out and that was the start of a very, very, dark lonely time in my life. i would seriously take as much xanax as i could buy. up until the beginning of this year. I had a script for 60 1mg footballs a month, and as much as i dont want to admit this, i would go through that in sometimes 2-3 days. i remember buying a hundred pack of some strong pressies about 3 or 4 years ago and it was on a friday. i woke up monday with zero xanax. this is just one of the probably 10-15 times i have done this. i cannot begin to tell y'all how many times ive gone through really bad withdrawals.. i didnt think i would make it through. There were honestly a lot of times i tried to end it.

im a 25 year old male and have had 5 seizures that should have taken my life. this last time i seized going up a couple flights of stairs... AT WORK. Fucking embarrassing. i woke up in the ER with my boss next to my laughing hysterically. i could barely breathe at the time and the only thing i could think of was my shoulder. i had another shoulder surgery (different shoulder from first surgery) and during my seizure i tore my labrum pretty badly but didnt want to do surgery because i knew something else was wrong. ive had 4 shoulder surgeries now and didnt really care about my shoulder cause i was just so excited i didnt re-hurt the shoulder i had a bone graph on. that seizure was in january and i laid on my couch thinking i was going to die. my doctor just took all benzos away from me so i had some good withdrawals, and come to find out i had a broken back this whole time. they didnt give me any pain meds which im glad. time for me to cowboy the fuck up and kick this habit. i love xanax and literally every other benzo out there. 

i am sharing this with everyone in case someone needs help or advice that really wants to kick the habit. I too, will need to talk to someone when i get bad cravings. none of my friends went hard enough to really understand the wd's ive had and the overall dependence for the drug. if you need help or want to just chat about it pm me! i love to hear other peoples stories and you sure as hell dont have to worry about judgement coming from this way. i want to find someone that wants to get off. i think the buddy system will work well for me as i cannot seem to open up to anyone close to me. nobody ever seems to understand where im coming from and it sucks.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63933283}"

Hallucinating right before you fall asleep and thinking you’ve never fallen asleep at all.


every time I close my eyes and fall right asleep I fall into this state of confusion thinking and wondering if I’ve fallen asleep or not and in reality I actually am but in my head I’m just constantly second guessing myself if I’m asleep or not. 
For instance I dreamt/hallucinated myself tossing and turning with the sensation of me having cat hair all over my skin and suddenly i snap out of it and look at my phone and 2hours has passed since I last “tried falling asleep” even tho in my dream/hallucination it only felt like 5minutes of me rubbing my skin.


Right after snapping out of this I go to the bathroom and comeback to bed and take a few bong rips and try to go to bed again. 

Right now as I’m typing this I really regret doing that because the moment I closed my eyes I was back in there but this time with sudden anxiety and the hallucinations got way more intense. 
I start off in the dream/hallucination by realizing I’m really high and shaking my feet. 
All of a sudden my girlfriend whos sleeping right beside me gets up and goes to the living room and puts on a tv show without saying anything, while I’m just shaking my feet and trying real hard to fall right back into sleep, I suddenly start shaking both of my feet for some weird reason suddenly I get fixated on the fake tv noises I’m hearing then I stopped shaking my feet. 

Then the tv noises just disappeared and I’m just hit with this dream loop of me just fixated on being high and filled with anxiety and whether I’m shaking my feet too hard or which one I should shake next or if i should shake them both. 
It was just real weird man, I snap out of this state of delirium which had felt like it lasted like a good 30minutes I look at my phone and only 8minutes has passed and my girlfriend is sleeping right next to me.


The moment I woke up I just felt so fucking confused and filled with paranoia I’m now sitting waiting for the sun to get up because I’m too afraid to close my eyes again and get an even worse hallucination while I fall asleep. I’m just now typing all this to just ground myself right now because honestly idk what is real anymore and what were dreams/hallucinations.


Anyway  tl;dr I need help trying to cope with this right now it’s almost 7am I have work tomorrow and I’m afraid of falling asleep because I hallucinate and enter a state of total confusion whenever I do",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5259386}"

Found Xanax 3 years ago, it got me hooked straight away. 

Primarily, my xanax use i would say helped push the break up along and i crashed her car etc. VERY messy and she has blocked me and i’ve been told she’s moving states for study. This is my biggest regret, she was a wonderful person and i would have married her if it weren’t for this wretched drug. It made me incredibly arrogant and confident in my negative ways. I would just take a xanax instead of talking about our problems. It was so toxic for her and she is better for leaving me. However, she was also indirectly why i relapsed, we had lots of fun nights on LSD, we used bars to sleep. 

Tapered down to 2mg from 6mg xanax within 2 weeks. i’m getting panic attacks, i think i tapered too quickly but i don’t have enough bars to do a slow taper. I also don’t want to get any more because i don’t want this life anymore. I think i have to live with the panic attacks. I can’t move, i feel immobilised. 

Oh, i’m also cutting out alcohol, coffee, cannabis, cigarettes. All of which i’d use daily. Yeah that’s probably why i’m having panic attacks now that i type it out. Cutting out so much, my body feels so confused probably. Yeah i had a lot of vices because just like my dad and granddad, we are all drunks. Go figure right? It did help me learning that genetics are also at play and that’s why i have even stronger desire to be sober forever.

So I fully quit benzos after a pretty long taper in October 2017. I drank for about 2 years after that and felt pretty terrible but it was manageable. Most of it could have just been being hungover often for all I know. I stopped drinking last October and decided to try again once last week, and again at a small BBQ the other day. I feel fucking awful. I have a dull headache that can’t be fixed by any painkillers, my muscles ache and feel super uncomfortable, and I have weird sniffles and uncomfortable sinus stuff. I’m also super irritable and on edge. The symptoms are nothing compared to what I experienced while tapering, but they’re still extremely unpleasant. It has gotten gradually better every day, but I’m wondering if anyone else has any experience with this and if so how it played out and for how long?

I’m aware that it’s recommended to not drink for a long period of time, possibly never again, after quitting benzos. I’m also aware that even the Ashton Manual says it’s ok to partake from time to time, so there’s a lot of grey area.

Going to put a longer post of a success story i had with usage, the taper plan, and hopefully to easy some people's minds of shorter term usage people on this forum. I asked my doctor the question i will ask but she wasnt very helpful. 

Short story was put on xanax 2 to 3mg a day for 3 months for Agoraphobia (fear of living house) that resulted from a medical condition which is now healed (no history of it before). I quit xanax after short taper as i was repressing this fear instead of solving it and back to pre benzo self luckily after a month.

My question is when i leave the house i have full blown panic attacks and i get so nauseated just moving to the car from my house. I am working to solve issue and luckily working at home allows me to keep my job but i have 4 cavities that really need work on that were diagnosed in April but they only started doing dental work now.

So i called a specialist yesterday after a follow up phone call a week prior. it was all so sudden,, he texted me this morning telling me he has gotten a hold of a facility in Boston, where i’ll be flying out there tomorrow morning. sent to a detox center for 7 days then i’ll be admitted to inpatient rehab for 90 days. this is all so sudden but im ready for a change, i just dont know what to expect.. as far as detoxing and rehabilitating. if any of you can give me some expectations, tips or anything really would help keep my mind at ease. thank you <3",22,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43799555}"

in the day after that i took 4mg probably.

today i started to get symptoms such as burning skin and shit but after i took 3mg of diazepam along with chamomile tea they slowly faded.

i drink chamomile or other herbs tea's everyday tho. i probably will quit chamomile because when i finish the tapering its probably gonna save my ass to drink some tea.

if i was stable at 5mg, should i cut to 4mg straight??!!

Our brains think that we should be expecting a level increase in mental health each day we are sober but this isn’t the case. For me anyways, it seems as tho I was the exact same level of depression and anxiety right until the last couple of weeks were I’ve been more active and I’ve made a rapid recovery to the point where I’m taking my pregabalin only once a week now for bigger social interactions. I know it’s cliche but keep at it, the road to recovery is not a plottable graph, you WILL get better even if you’re doing nothing but keeping sober and eating. However socialising and being active will help you to not just be as good as you should be but stronger, and it does happen so don’t give up.

I will not get into all of my drug use but I just got out of detox for benzos and opiates. For 12 years I’ve been on benzos and opiate daily; without a break whatsoever. The detox basically just checked to make sure I didn’t die and honestly they didn’t even do a great job at that. The experience is what I imagine hell is like. I’ll say this and I don’t use this loosely...I will forever have PTSD and be mentally scared for life from that experience. I can’t even get into what all happened because I don’t want to deal with it right now. It’ll definitely be part of my testimony (assuming I come out on top). Anyway...I cannot live like this...the physical WD’s are bad enough but the mental ones are nearly unbearable. There is almost no escape. For instance I had to go through opiate WDs for a few days once (I had subs) but I was still able to physically feel like shit but mentally be happy, motivated, and able to enjoy TV, movies, games, etc. Now I have absolutely no sense of happiness, self worth, or interest in anything. I kept trying to explain to the doctors how I felt and they blamed it on everything except the WDs! They say “you have to want it.” Believe me, I do, it’s not a Motivation thing...It’s a dopamine thing! I have no dopamine! How I’m able to function on any level is beyond me and nothing short of an act from God! The only thing that gives me a little bit of relief and makes it to where I’m able to eat a little is my...Ambien ER, my Baclofen, and my Gabapentin or LYRICA. The doctor at the detox kept me on all of those except for the Ambien and told me I could take it once I got back home. She said that it wasn’t possible to come off of all my prescriptions in a week without it potentially costing me my life. I took everything she said with a grain of salt and honestly feel  I’m more qualified than she is when it comes to WDs, PAWS, etc. I know those three medications are all GABAergic medications. I guess I’m just wondering if I have to stay away from all of them in order for my brain to heal properly. If I do, I’m wondering what I can take to give me a bit of relief.

I just want answers. I just paid thousands of dollars cash out of my own pocket for a detox and now I’m on Reddit looking for answers they were supposed to give me. Thank you so much for listening to my rant! I hope and pray all of us find answers to dealing with these evil medications! God bless!

I’ve taken kpins for 7 years and had panic disorder for 17. I turned into a daily user when getting my PhD and then upped my dose from a stressful job up to 2mg a day for almost 2 years.

Nothing really worked to abolish panic attacks, and the “this too shall pass” mantra became exhausting after a decade without benzos. 

Another question: is .5mg per day (this is my goal for now, as I took that dose for 5 years, with a noticeable decline in migraines AND ability to live life on that dose) damaging to the brain?

I have generalized anxiety disorder, occasional panic attacks, and several phobias that impact my life. I’m on an SSRI for the anxiety and subsequent depression. They work well for me. 

But my doctor also prescribes me Klonopin - 0.5 milligrams, 45 pills every 6 months or so. I usually use these when I’m in a phobic situation (fear of flying and I’m on an airplane, for example.)  Most of these phobic situations are few and far between, and I end up taking klonopin on average once or twice a month. But sometimes life gets crazy all at once, and I’ll end up taking Klonopin two or three times a week - COVID panic due to hypochondria; needing an MRI and claustrophobia; etc.  

I recently started therapy with a great therapist and I’ve been getting into CBT therapy, it’s helping a lot. I’d like to stop taking Klonopin forever, because I’ve never felt comfortable taking it. I just feel like it doesn’t really help me grow as a person, it doesn’t address my fears, it just delays any healing I could be doing.

So, my question is - based on the information above and the fact that I don’t take Klonopin on a daily basis, if I just stop forever, should I experience physical signs of withdrawal?

Opiates or Benzos... what to do?,"So my Benzo story is a bit different than most. I’ve talked to doctors about it and apparently it’s rare that someone has an “anxiety attack” that’s life threatening as I do. I suppose, it’s a extreme neurological response. Blood pressure that shoots up to 220/120 and heart 200 bpm. First time this happened, er ran all sorts of test because it just would not go down. My friend was there with me and said “take this”. It was a Xanax. I took it. I started feeling a little better... I then felt normal, like magic.. I didn’t tell the doctor I took it but he did see that my vitals were normalizing and said “you must’ve just had a bad anxiety attack” and released me. It happened to me again.... Ems was called because it was worse.. I finally went to the doctor and have been on Benzos ever since. I realized what need be done when I’m in that situation now. I save the ems a trip and I chew up 2 Xanax (my daily dose at once) and it usually stops it within 15 minutes.

Now I’m in a predicament. I’m a pain patient with failed back syndrome. I can’t have surgery to fix it because it would be super invasive and would take well over the 12 hours (my initial surgery took this long). Covid ravaged my lungs in March/April and they are permanently damaged now. They said that even if my lungs clear to a suitable level, this will still be a extremely risky procedure. 4 out of 5 surgeons turned me away, the one that accepted me... welll....my primary told me that this guys been sued so many times... he will do surgery on anyone no matter what the risk. He has habits and addictions to feed of his own, gambling , women and drugs. He will unnecessarily fuse vertebrae that don’t need to be and he’s ruined a lot of lives. 

This leaves me in a tough spot because I’m consistently given a ultimatum from my pain docs. Benzos or opiates. It could be deadly... (even though I’ve been taking them for 10 years 😑). I really don’t see how I can function without either one of those. The thought of going without Xanax scares the living shit out of me. I’m almost sure I’d die from a stroke. Then the thought of no pain meds sounds like I would just want to end it all from the extreme pain.

Long story short my doctor referred me to a psychiatric clinic that specializes in addiction and the Psychiatrist came to the decision that he's going to tell my doctor to stop giving me Klonopin altogether. 

For context, I take .25 mg every day, about a year ago I was taking .5 a day, year before 1 mg a day since 2015. I've been on benzos for over 5 years but my doctor is arguing that i'm at such a low dose I shouldn't have any severe side effects but i'm fucking terrified. 

Last time my doctor tried to switch me from .25 every day to .25 every other day I had to call off work for a week and nearly got fired because I was absolutely losing my mind from anxiety.

When explaining this to the nurse who called me she said ""Well those aren't physical symptoms, they are mainly psychological so it isn't so bad.""

Wtf?

Obviously it's psychological Lmao. Last time I tried to cold turkey even off .25 i was suicidal. I don't want to deal with it again. 

But theyre giving me no choice and have no sympathy to be honest. I live in Sweden and they are extremely anti benzo. I tried to explain that I wanted to do a micro taper but once again they gave me the ""my dose is so small it doesnt matter anyways"" thing. 

Im shitting my pants. I have 5 tablets so about 10 days left and even better im starting a new school in 7 days.

I ordered CBD and ashwaganda and have been taking the following: fish oil, vit D, and b-complex. 

Please for the love of god if you have any suggestions please throw them my way. I keep looking up articles to try and find help but everything i read is traumatizing me basically saying my life is gonna be hell for the next year and I will never fully recover. 

If you've recovered from this dose please tell me. Please tell me it gets better.

I'm crying in fear.

So now I'm now on a hold of 15mg for a while, my new doctor thinks I'm taking 8mg which he's prescribing and he's been dropping me from 20mg by 1mg a week. 

It was pointless to change his mind about the speed of the taper so I went with it(free pills) and I'm using my stash to add to it to slow it down, which has about 250 10mg valium left no Xanax left, only used one box

His taper plan will end in 8 weeks, I might get him to hold for a month at 5mg(more free pills lol).

So how do I do this? half mg a week? Any help would be great thanks.

EDIT:
I’ve discovered that magnesium does indeed have a short acting Benzo-like effect and does indeed need to be tapered at least after long term high dosage use like I’ve been doing. This was heartbreaking to find out, but it actually gives some clarity to why my withdrawals so dramatic and unpredictable. 
—-

Forewarning: this is a complicated situation. 

I’ve been on Ativan for 5 years, only finding out the last 9 months how dangerous it is. I’ve been chipping away down from 1.12mg to 0.9mg (after many failed tapers). 

However my chronic back pain got so bad recently that I took a barbiturate painkiller for about a week (had no idea what a mistake that would be), which ended up putting me into withdrawal crisis, leaving me no choice but to up my benzos to an equivelant of 1.5mg Ativan (I added 6mg of diazepam, because I was about to start the Ashton method anyhow). 

I’ve also been on trazodone during all that time, and since March have been on 1500mg Gabapentin. 

The worst part of my condition is that I have debilitating back pain for which there is no evidence for why I have it. MRI comes up with nothing.  Liver function is fine, colonoscopy and upper endoscopy shows nothing, sonogram shows no gallstones. 

Whenever I eat my back pain gets terrible, so much so that I’m 5’5” and I’ve dropped from 135 to 117 because I can’t handle anything more than about 450 calories per day. My motility is shot - takes forever for food to move through my system. 

I’ve been told by numerous practitioners that I can have as much magnesium as I want, because my body will just urinate out what it doesn’t need 

So I’ve been using more magnesium than I even want to admit (above 1000mg sometimes) to keep my digestion moving. 

I also take epsom salt (magnesium chloride) baths to soothe my back muscles. I’ve been trying to cut back my magnesium ever since reading about a magnesium conflict. I’m going on this Thursday for an epidural steroid to hopefully help with the pain. 

I’m sorry for such a long post but I wanted to give you at least some of the picture. There’s many more symptoms that I’m dealing with but these are the details that I think are relevant. 

I’m so concerned that magnesium has put me into a position that it’s going to take the rest of my adult life to recover from - and being in pain the whole time.

I was prescribed clonazepam “for life” (my doctor is clearly a doofus), and I’ve been taking 2 x 0.5mg in the morning, and 2 x 0.5mg at night for to years.

He dismissed refilling my script last year, which landed me in the ER with multiple seizures. Simply BC I didn’t have my clonazepam for roughly 4 days. You think it won’t happen to you... until it does. 
I lost my license as a result, and have been eager to tell him I want OFF , ASAP.

He didn’t listen to me and kept refilling it, so I started tapering myself having done extensive research. 

My prescription:
two pills in the morning. (0.5mgx 2)
two pills at night (0.5mg x 2) 

On week one of my self-taper, I started only taking 1 pill in the morning. Night dose remained the same.

In two weeks, I cut out the morning doses altogether. So I was only left with night doses.

In 2-3 weeks, I cut the night dose to only 1 pill. 

Now, it’s been a month or two .... which is way longer than I usually go without cutting. BECAUSE IT IS SO PHYSICALLY TAXING. 

My hands shake tremendously EVERY minute. 
I can’t sleep properly to save my ass. 
My stomach is so bloated. Zero energy. I have audio hallucinations. Socializing is off the schedule- as it’s a dead end road to anxiety. 
I’m so eager to get this OVER WITH. But if you’ve ever been through a benzo withdrawal, you know that it is absolute hell on f*king earth. And doctors can’t help. They’re clueless.

Should I crush up my 0.5mg pill and put it in a syringe?

Surprisingly, I haven't had much trouble sleeping, and that's one of the main reasons I started taking it.  And no seizures or anything like that.

Totally bizarre because I'll touch my face and nothing is there!! I can't even really feel anything under my skin. But if I lay my head down on a pillow I can definitely feel my head kinda ""moving"" like waves in an ocean or something. Whats weird is I remember when I was tapering I was so scared of my derealization I constantly took off my glasses and now I get anxious if I don't have my contacts in hahaha

- Memory and thinking seems to be really impaired. I seem to be losing my ability to think coherent thoughts through and it just feels like I'm stupid or something and unable to understand basic crap that shouldn't be a problem.

- Feeling Depersonalized. The best way to describe this is that I'm watching my life through another outlet. It feels awful. I also notice that sometimes I find that I'll be ""lost in my thoughts"" kind of feels like dissociation but not at the same time?

- My mood is fluctuating, sometimes I feel like slightly manic.

Perhaps even more than you did before withdrawals, as you’ve felt deprived of these things for so long.

You’ll see a cat with yellow eyes looking at you pensively, find a beautiful piece of perfectly round sea glass by the beach and wonder what it has seen, eat a particularly sweet cherry tomato, be hugged by someone who smells warm, listen to music and actually be able to **feel it** in what seems like the first time in in forever. And you’ll be glad you’re still here, functioning, existing, even when you thought you wouldn’t be able to live anymore 6 months ago.

Sometimes I feel I’ve wasted a year, but life is not a timeline. I even read that life isn’t a journey; it’s more like a piece of music. There’s no concept of destination; the beauty comes from the meanderings and the ups and downs. Plus, I’ve emerged much wiser from this experience. Experiences like this certainly wisen you to take fewer things for granted.

Take some time to parent and nurture yourself. Treat your future self like another person, a friend.

A few nights of restless sleep, that was all. I figured cutting 0.25 to 0.125 would be fine, and then I could jump from 0.125. Hahaha, not so fast, self! The cut to 0.125 hit me after about 10 days, and I went from having mildly annoying symptoms to being completely non-functional and winding up in the ER a couple times. I feared losing my job, so I tried to find a way to stabilize and then taper more slowly. I went back to 0.25 and stabilized there, took a few days off work and was able to get back to exercising, meditating, etc. I told my doctor about my tapering plan, then got a second opinion, and felt like I was going to do OK.

I suppose going back to the 0.25 was a mistake, because I've now tapered just to 0.20 and I'm starting to feel like a mess again. Shakiness, tightness in my chest, acid reflux, the weird ""hot flashes"" that last five hours, near-constant paranoia that I have covid-19, etc. I can at least function at work for now (desk job, working remote), but I feel so trapped. Will I eventually stabilize at 0.20? Will I be able to taper to 0.15 in a few weeks without disaster? I'm not taking anything else right now, though my regular doctor (who's pretty clueless about benzos, tbh) mentioned librium as a possibility, and the other doctor I talked to (my good friend's dad) mentioned tapering to valium as an option. I've considered CBD as well. But I'm having such a rough reaction to just the small taper that I'm hesitant to throw another factor into the mix.

Even though I feel Like dying sometimes. Waking up is the worst I remember all these terrible things. Memories, people I’ve lost, where I’ve made mistakes. Where I’ve gone ‘wrong’.  Worry about anything and all things.

All part of it. Very familiar with the withdrawal this is my third or 4th time trying to get off. This is the most successful I’ve been at sticking to a taper and not adding onto my daily dose. Proud.

I feel Insane and panic and losing so much weight but I’m still proud. Cuz everyday I feel like shit, I know it means I’m getting healthier and moving towards better.

Just wish these thoughts were different, nothing I can do on that part. The benzo withdrawal thoughts are crazy madness paranoia insanity panic fear worry based and I see it for what it is.

I’ve met people that I connect with but it’s like they just leave my life all of a sudden so guess not trying that now? I don’t know. Closed off. Whatever other people will come into my life it’s okay. I do have a few solid friends helping take care of me during this time since I’m stuck in bed for lots of hours of the day. 

All will be okay. I’m gonna believe so. I got this. Hope all you are well up to PM if you wanna chat I’m lonely asf and depressed and wanna cry, but chatting gets my brain to have something to focus on and forget how insane it is what I’m experiencing physically emotionally and mentally right now. Hopefully in a few days I’ll adjust. Usually I do. My names Lexi by the way 🖤🙏🏼🤢🥴",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40026388}"

About a month ago I began taking Xanax nightly. I took 1-2 mg daily for 3 weeks and then for a week I took about 3mg of Clonazepam daily. I quit CT benzos last Wednesday, about 10 days ago now and I think I’m peaking with my WDs? Last night I had the worst headache ever I literally thought my head was gonna explode I was on the brink of calling 911. I don’t know how but it ended up passing. Today my mom bought me Excederin extra strength and I took 2. My headache actually kinda went away but the brain fog I’ve had for weeks is still here. Anyways I started getting chills and every single part of my body aches. I started getting all panicky and kinda dizzy and nauseous. I feel like I have the flu but no fever or actual symptoms. I got tested for COVID literally like a week ago (tested negative) and haven’t left my house or been around anyone. There’s no way I could’ve gotten it in a week.

I've read about buying a scale but it seems as though you'd have to be very precise or you'd ruin a few tabs, no?

Is it difficult to taper this way to get the correct doses right every time? How does this all work?

School a newbie, plz.

My plan was basically to start on an SSRI, Lexapro for mornings + hydroxyzine at night, and start reducing my dosages as such:

I take 1mg daily, morning and night.

Then scale down to .75 mg for the first month. Half at night, full .5 in morning.

The following month break up a half into two halves. So .125 + .5  in the morning, then the .125 at night.

Then next month just .5, half in morning, half at night.

Also, can I just jump off from taking .125 now? I’ve been at this dose for about a month and just want off, but I’ve also just finished a full taper off my SSRIs and cut my Wellbutrin in half, so I’m not sure where my current withdrawal symptoms are coming from.
