34F, 110lbs. I've been taking .50-.75mg of Alprazolam for the better part of a year now. I was originally on .25mg when needed for a couple years leading to regular daily usage of .25mg since Covid, but in spring 2021 my dr increased my dosage to .50mg daily.

Depends on the day, I am anywhere around .50-.75mg averaged daily, but could deal with .25mg on good days, and would do up to 1.5mg on rare really bad days. Routine has been .5mg in the morning and sometimes .25mg later in the day for the last 3-4 months and maybe a day off once a week usually on the weekend. I also take 150mg of bupropion daily. I spoke with my dr earlier this month and he is not going to reduce my prescription but wants me to refill every 2 months instead of 1.

I took my last dose of .25mg on Sunday morning. As of yesterday (Tuesday) I'm getting intense waves of anxiety starting in the early afternoon. My stomach is not bloated but is knotted up with anxiety, I have not slept really well, I have brain fog, and tension headaches that Advil won't cure. I could refill my .5mg daily prescription, but getting these symptoms makes me realize I need to lay off more than I thought.

I know it's not a really high dose, but I am also petite. I looked around this sub and it definitely seems case-by-case. Anyone have any idea how long this is gonna last? I want to crawl out of my skin.. knowing it's a chemically manufactured anxiety helps rationalize it, but it's still quite unpleasant. Any insight is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2

So my story in brief, I had an intense binge that began as self medicating and became an intense binge. 20 2.5mg Xanax, 15 10mg Valium and 28 7.5mg Zoplicone in roughly 10 days. Last dose was Zoplicone on the 23rd of July I believe.

It's been hell, especially for the first month and a half. Just awful. The one saving grace was that though it was almost unbearable in the morning, it eased off in the evening to become bearable and I could enjoy some stuff, maybe between 7-12 most days. I'd wake up anxious as fuck, health anxiety, depressed, unable to get back to sleep, I'd dry heave or be sick If I managed to eat, I had no appetite, muscle twitching, broken sleep

My good days were still shit. I hit my low on the 10th of September, I was suicidal, tried to throw myself in front of a car.

Since then, I've come a long way. Not a single moment since the 10th has been as bad as my bad days before it. My bad days now are probably as good as my good days used to be. Anxiety and depression are my only remaining symptoms really.

From 17th to 22nd I had a run of genuinely happy, good days, for which I'm so grateful. I saw the sun again. Same on the 24th.

Unfortunately since then, the grey clouds have covered up the sun and the rain has been constant. No relief on the evenings. My silver lining is that at least it isn't nearly as bad as it was, it's lower level just more constant.

You guys have any advice for the benzo depression? For maybe maintaining a sense of stability from day to day to minimise the coming and going of the depression aspect?",2

It has been a very torturous process. I never thought it would take this long and I'm only dropping  . 10.mg at a time and it takes weeks for the w/d symptoms to subside. My anxiety has been ramping up along with my ADD and severe muscle pains/cramps. Seems like I was injuring myself with just the smallest movements . My brain has music playing in it constantly which would be the same song and so loud that it was distracting me from being able to concentrate. Plus I was waking up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall back asleep.  I was at the end of my rope.
Enter Magnesium Theonate. I decided to give magnesium theonate a chance and boy am I happy I did. Within a couple of days my aches and pains started to go away. The music in my brain became a lot softer and my mood has been much brighter and lighter. Plus my mind is sharper and more focused. I sleep better and usually through the night (although I still naturally wake up around 5am). Thanks benzos!!  The only downside is headaches appear to be a side effect. Hopefully they will go away with time. However, I'll take the headaches because the positives far outweigh the negatives. 
If you find yourself with similar symptoms to mine, perhaps you are low in magnesium. Seriously, I thought I was going crazy and now I'm feeling more like my ""old self'.",6

Mainly (all manner of) stims, alcohol and DXM but I've abused every class of drug at various points. Benzos were a mainstay for me in my early 20's (clonazepam 8-10 mgs a day at the height of my use) but I've been off of them for several years. 

I still have ongoing issues with anxiety. I'm also bipolar and currently on Lamictal as a mood stabilizer  Had a therapist that suspected ASD a while ago as I have some weird ""tics,"" sensory shit and strange affective presentation at times but they came to the conclusion that I probably just broke my brain from all the stimming and research chems 😆

To get right into it, I came across a GABA supplement today at Wal-Mart while getting some groceries and was curious if anyone here had experience with it? If you have was it helpful for managing anxiety? Did it have any physical or psychological effects akin to Benzos? Thanks and best of luck on your journey. I'll have 1 year clean/sober on the 2nd!

I am feeling so proud of myself.  Today is 30 days since I took my last dose of Xanax after my month long taper.  I took them on and off for about 4 years, and the last two years were daily use.  I would take .5 to 1mg daily.  I tapered down for 30 days.  Jumped off at .25mg.

Things that have really helped me through the last 30 days.

Keeping myself busy...I have completed more of my half finished projects in the last 30 days than I have in many years.  Car, truck, motorcycle, house etc.
My animals...I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and they are my homies.  They must know im am going through it because they all are extra attentive to me, more so than normal.
Large amounts of marijuana.  Not even kidding.  I normally smoke an ounce a week of the best indoor I can find.  I am currently smoking close to 2 ounces a week but gradually smoking less.  Incida preferrably...this Gary Payton strain has been helping a lot.
Magnesium.  I read on here it helps with sleep.  I bought magnesium glycinate made by pure encapsulation on Amazon. Take two before bed.  I sleep like a baby.

I think clearer.  I have more energy.  I'm happier.  I csn feel my emotions, and while it is odd, I am learning to embrace it again.

I just wanted to say thank you for your support.  The messages and comments after my first post really helped me stay strong.

I hope everyone in here can join me in being free of benzos.

I just disposed of the remaining 108 Xanax Bars I had left and if felt amazing.

You can do it too!

I am currently tapering off of Xanax, already down to a low dose (just over half a bar per day via a single evening dose). I'm feeling in control and I am not pushing myself beyond my limits (I learned the hard way).

My question is about a feeling I have every morning. I wake up every day from a random dream, usually very uneventful and ""normal"" stuff, nothing remotely traumatic. But as soon as I wake up my brain immediately attaches feelings of dread, anxiety, etc. to the leftover dream in any way it can. Perfectly innocent stuff suddenly becomes traumatic somehow.

It's quite hard to describe it exactly. I just wondered if this is normal, or if anybody else has the same feeling. Even better, I hoped somebody might have some suggestions to mitigate this feeling.

Once I fully wake up the feeling goes away so it isn't a huge problem, it's just a really unpleasant way to start each day and I'm worried that it might continue after I've finished tapering (i.e. no more Xanax whatsoever).

This is the only substance I am still using. I have been clean from heroin, cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamine, etc. for several months.

Sorry if this is all a bit vague, I just wanted to check that this feeling isn't a sign that I'm doing something wrong. I am so impatient to get off this horrible drug and I want to make the process as easy as possible to make sure I stay on track, especially with the end nearly in sight.

Thanks in advance for any help. Good luck, everyone.",15

So I've been taking 1mg Klonopin for about 6 - 8 weeks give or take. I usually dose once a week and try to deal with my anxiety the other 6 days. I have never felt any withdrawal symptoms from it or even rebound anxiety for that matter.

However, last week (tuesday I believe), I decided to dose 2mg with some friends. Then the next night I went to see Carnifex and The Black Dahlia Murder with my other friend and drank more than I usually do, about 7 beers. The next day I took nothing (included this because benzos and alcohol have cross tolerance and are both GABAergic types of substances). Then on Friday, I really felt like shit, so I took a .5mg Klonopin and felt better. Then Saturday, 2pm rolls around start to feel anxious and dissociation heavy, so I take another .5mg.

Here we are now on Monday, I get home from work and it all kinda hits me (anxiety, one instance of a muscle spasm, intrusive thoughts, etc.) so about 20 minutes ago I dosed a .25mg. As I'm typing this I'm pretty anxious and shaky, also kind of have a headache and heavy derealization. Muscles feel kind of tight, like the back of my neck.

Honestly I am mortified of benzo withdrawals, so that might be part of it, but I'd like to get everyone's opinion. I have enough to do a taper, but I don't know if thats necessary. Maybe dose every couple days and do a taper that way? Avoid it altogether? I don't know.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk

Seems like there's new terminology to refer to symptoms beyond 6 months ""persistent PAWS"" and is more favorable with short acting, potent benzos (Ativan, Xanax, etc).

""Persistent Post-Withdrawal Disorders after Benzodiazepine Discontinuation

The literature on persistent post-withdrawal disorders after long-term benzodiazepine use and discontinuation is hardly existent. Notwithstanding this, anxiety, depression, psychosis, cognitive impairment, insomnia, sensory phenomena (i.e., tinnitus, tingling, numbness, paresthesia, deep or burning pain in limbs, feeling of inner trembling or vibration, strange skin sensations), motor phenomena (i.e., muscle pain, weakness, painful cramps, tremor, jerks, spasms, shaking attacks), and gastrointestinal disturbances (patients complain of food intolerance and gaseous abdominal distension) have been described [41]. Length of treatment and high potency with short to intermediate elimination half-life seem important to favor the occurrence of persistent post-withdrawal disorders [41]. It has been observed that withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of low-dose benzodiazepine may take 6–12 months to subside completely [47] and in some cases they persist for years [41].""

I told him about my history of being on klonopin (1mg 3 times a day or more if needed) and how I don’t want to go back on a benzo. I told him I was dependent on them, and I hated how I felt on them and recovery was something I don’t want to have to go through again. 
He just looked at me and said “people with diabetes are dependent on insulin, being dependent isn’t always a bad thing.” 
He immediately wanted to start me on klonopin even though I am 7 months pregnant. 

I stopped listening after that. I just am so tired of doctors and therapists pushing medication when I explicitly said I don’t want them, I would rather learn helpful coping skills.",22

- June 2020: prescribed an anti biotic to treat a stomach bacterial infection (metronidazole/flagyl) causes a severe and adverse toxic reaction. Life essentially implodes. Long and terrifying list of symptoms including, but not limited to; extreme DR, intense head pressure, migraine with aura, constant panic, doom, dread, terror, unable to leave house, unable to drive, blurred vision, panic attacks, fatigue, pins and needles etc. Begin taking Valium intermittently in the afternoons to help panic feeling  
- Sep-Oct 2020: prescribed anti depressant to try to mitigate toxicity symptoms. Prozac causes more symptoms such as agitation and insomnia. I cease medication abruptly upon doctors orders after 5 months 
- Oct 2020: prescribed 2.5mg Ativan to sleep. Eventually halved the tablet to 1.25mg for two months or so, then was prescribed 1mg (total use 6 months). I never abused and only took medication as prescribed. Eventually realised instead of getting better I became more and more sick. I was in tolerance and 10 months into this ordeal was hanging by a thread.  

Taper 3 months, jumped 100 days ago 


Previous post about tapering here: 
 [how I tapered](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/o2gf9b/helpful_advice_about_tapering/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Since jumping: 
- First two weeks or so I felt okay. I still had symptoms, but the mental reward for knowing I never had to take that poison again counted for a lot. My main symptoms were; agoraphobia, nausea, head pressure, tinnitus, anxiety, some depression, overheating, some issues sleeping, body aches 

- I then hit a 6 day window. This was a window where I felt around 7/10. Symptoms were much lessened, I started making social plans and my mum and I truly believed this was a turning point and the worst was behind me 

- As many Benzo people know, the cruelty of recovery in the form of windows and waves, came crashing down on me. I was plunged into a 51 day wave. Aches, terrible head pressure, depression, SI, hopelessness, anxiety, DR, agoraphobia, issues sleeping; simply could not get comfortable in bed and was boiling hot and sweating throughout the night. My waves are always 10x worse during my cycle too, everything ramps up. The feeling, metaphorically in my mind, felt like I had been let out of jail and had felt the sun on my face only to be yanked straight back into the darkness. I found this window to wave transition to be one of the hardest points in this 15 month hell(and there have been *many*)

- Currently, I’ve been in a *window* for around 3 weeks. I still don’t feel great, but the symptoms on some days have been not severe enough to stop me leaving the house for walks with friends. I even drove my friend to the beach the other day, albeit feeling totally overwhelmed by the stimuli and internally panicking, and went for a huge walk and dip. *Progress*. I’m sleeping well, which is always conducive to healing but also representative of a window. Before my period was unpleasant but not at the level of severity it has been. Mostly, tinnitus, light DR, fatigue, light and sound sensitivity and anxiety are what plagues me atm. Even though I’m not well yet, I am miles better compared to where I was in my 51 day wave. I like to say to my mum that I’m not good yet but definitely “less shit”. It’s in these windows when the hopelessness tends to finally shift and light seems to shine through the clouds a little bit again. 

I’ve been worrying for a very long time about suffering PTSD as a result of this experience. However, the small tastes of life I’ve had again, make me realise that once the crippling aspects of this insidious experience pass, that I will fight to live every single moment of my life thereafter. I want to smile when I wake up on a Saturday morning, tired from a long week of teaching and a well deserved sleep in. I want to get up and drink COFFEE and eat pancakes, head out for a walk in the sun where everything is clear, no longer disconnected, foggy, blurry or nauseous. I want to workout at the gym and reap all the benefits of the endorphins pumping around my body, instead of fearing of a wave or worrying about having a panic attack. I want to go out with my friends and completely be in the moment, laughing and soaking up the social interaction rather than the storm of thoughts inside my head. I want to enjoy a sunset and look forward to a milestone, instead of counting the days one by one as I move away from benzos. I want to jump on a plane and travel without the second thought of being too far from home. I want to listen to music, drink cocktails, and yell over it to speak to my friends without fear and panic coursing through my body with each raise in volume. I want all these things, and I will fight tooth and nail to get them back again. As I hope you all will too. 

I know this is a long post, but talking to people on this sub, friends from all over the world linked by this one walk through hell, and the hundreds of posts, some years old, are what *truly* has gotten me through some of the darkest days I’ve ever experienced in my life. Probably darker than any human being should be subjected to. So I hope this post helps somebody somewhere too. Even if you just feel seen, because this random girl from Australia understands the hell you’re walking through. I hope it gives you hope that you can walk it and survive too.",59

I've been on benzos for some years now. I've tappered down to 10mg a day two years ago and I started my (hopefully) last tappering a month ago.

I started it with 9mg on week 1, 8mg on week 2 and then jumped to 5mg in the middle of week 2 (2.5 in the morning, 2.5 before bedtime). I'm almost 3 weeks on 5mg now. 

Upsides:
 Anxiety is high but manageable. I haven't had any panic attacks, just some problems breathing a couple of nights.

Downsides:
 I ended up leaving my girlfriend while still in love with her, just because I felt overwhelmed by my personal problems and anxiety and I felt too vulnerable and in need of time completely alone. I feel withdrawal has to do with it. I would like to call her but I feel really anxious about it. I didn't tell her that I was running away from my own issues.

What helps me managing withdrawal symptoms:
 Exercise, keeping a healthy routine, staying away from depressive music/movies/whatever and avoiding very stressful stimuli. The latter is actually bad in the long term (what you avoid gets stronger) but it helps right now.

My tips:
 Be aware that if you do a fast tappering odds are your anxiety is going up, so if you choose this route try to solve your personal problems BEFORE starting the tappering. I mean the ones not directly related to benzos oc. 

I plan to be off Valium by January; I want to FEEL and THINK again like I used to before benzos. I will report back.

Stay strong!",3

I've been having significant but not crippling panic attacks lately. Suicidal thoughts and a major depressive episode. This is situational as I have some hard shit to deal with in my life right now.

My doctor gave me 15 ativan and they have been extremely effective. I took 10 of them over the last month. I have an appointment Monday and want to ask for some more. I'm not sure if he will give them to me or not.

I'm concerned about dependency and rebound anxiety. I've had mental health issues my whole life and the last thing I want to do is make them worse. I can't handle additional anxiety right now, like... really can't.

I assume I have a low dose but I can't see it on the bottle. My doc isn't much for pills tho hes never given me any medication I didn't start on lowest dose to check tolerance.

It's hard to tell what's a danger zone for Ativan. Am I taking too many? Is another month of taking 10 ish putting me in a danger zone?

Is the crippling anxiety I'm feeling some days now maybe partially attributed to withdrawal?

Any advice?",5

I was put on a very strong taper in hospital because my symptoms were so severe.

(Valium) 
Day 1 - 10mg three times a day
Day 2 - 10 mg three times a day
Day 3 - 10 mg three times a day
Day 4 - 10 mg three times a day
Day 5 - 10 mg twice a day
Day 6 - 5 mg twice a day
Day 7 - 5 mg twice a day

Other info. I've had withdrawal from alcohol before, so im kindled that way. About 4 times, each time raising in severity. I've also had one benzo withdrawal about two years ago. It wasn't a huge dose but I had symptoms for about three weeks after a months low dose xanax use.

Now what im going through now mentally is bothering me. Im anxious, I have anhedonia which sucks so much, im feeling quite agitated and feel some restlessness and my mild OCD tendencies have gone up a notch and my night time ritual which had been in remission has came back. (Move door handle three times to make sure it's locked, rub my Witcher medallion on my mirror three times, tap my chest lightly three times, pull my window closed three times). This makes me feel safe or something, like good luck. And im quite neat and symmetrical but this has gone up too. These don't take up too much of my time so it's like just strong tendencies but bothersome. So what im asking is the title basically. Because of the high amount of valium could this be intense rebound, alongside some PAWS from the alcohol? (Which usually never gives me the tendencies to be honest that's why im thinking benzo rebound) I guess I'd just like some reassurance. My brain chemistry is probably intense right now considering everything. Im pretty emotional too, and a bit scared. What do you guys think?",3

I work in the mental health field, I feel like I should have known better. I started being prescribed 1mg ER Xanax in 2016 which was upped later that year to 2 mg ER (extended release). I have was scared to take too many so I made sure to hardly ever use it, but filled prescriptions most months. In early 2020, I quit alcohol and my benzo use increased from there. I started taking daily 2mg Xanax XR from Jan 2020. I told my doctor about my fears of addiction and he switched me to 1 mg Ativan and .5 mg Ativan. That was way to little, I experience insomnia for two weeks, shaking, anxiety feeling like my throat was closing. I had so much extra xanax from years of rarely taking it.  So since Oct 2020 I've been using my stockpile of Xanax Xr 2mg daily plus 2-3 mg of Ativan. One time I took a total of 10 mg of benzodiazepines in one day just to feel relaxed again, but that scared the shit out of me. I went back to 2mg XR Xanax and 2-3mg of Ativan daily. I'm still incredibly anxious. I wake at 1 or 2 every morning for past two weeks and can't fall back asleep. I'm so scared, and tired, and sleep deprived. I would say since October 2020 it's a 50/50 split on whether I take only 2 mg of Ativan or 3mg, but it always at least that much plus Xanax. I also take an SSNI since 2017 which has been switched frequently, currently trintellix. Also take 2mg Abilify as of 3 weeks ago. I also take Ambien 10 mg nightly. Dx with GAD and MDD.

TO recap: daily 2mg XR Xanax since January 2020, daily 2-3mg Ativan since Oct 2020. Please help me taper. Please!!!! Thank you",4

Unfortunately, after 9 months being clean, I suffered a huge setback due to a set of Rabies Vaccines that I had to get. And I relapsed under psychiatric guidance. I am now 4 month into regular Clonazepam use of 0.5mg. I am going begin my taper Monday onwards. Please let me know your thoughts on how feasible it sounds.

I am planning on substituting my Clonazepam dosage with a Diazepam(Valium) one over the period of four weeks. By substituting 1/4th of the dose, or 0.125 mg, each week with 2.5 mg of Diazepam.

Then I am planning on tapering with Diazepam over a period of 10 -12 weeks with 1 mg reduction each week. From 10 mg to 0. 

Would love to hear feedback on how feasible this sounds. Broken on having to go through withdrawals again, but determined to come out better on the other side this time around.

I took .125mg at bedtime last night and slept better than I have in months.  It's crazy that such a miniscule dose can make a difference.  Took .125mg just now with morning meds, we'll see if it helps or not.  

I guess I'll have to go to water tapering after this since this dose is so low and just cutting .5mg pills into four is pretty challenging.

*Edit: after reading the responses in this thread and some self reflection I've decided I'm done trying to use alcohol as a crutch. Thanks for the help everyone.*

Before you judge, I chose to ask my doctor to switch me to Valium from Xanax so I can taper off of benzos, this is not a recreational thing. I actually hate how alcohol makes me feel under normal circumstances.

So like I said I am tapering, currently at 16mg/day of Valium, and it's going well overall, but I've had a few really rough days and I attempted to potentiate the Valium with a little bit of alcohol to calm me down and maybe get some sleep. I know it's not a great idea but I believe even Ms. Ashton herself said it was okay to have a glass or two of wine during your taper, and I personally don't think a few drinks a few times a month would be notably deprimental. 

I've tried this 3 times; the first time I had 3 beers and it actually worked extremely well, they definitely synergized with the Valium, my anxiety pretty much disappeared and I didn't suffer any after effects at all. 

But the last two times I've tried having 3 shots of liquor and it didn't work at all, I just felt like shit, during and after.

I'm wondering if the difference was because of beer vs liquor, or timing relative to when you take your dose, or what. Any ideas?

Again, this is *not* for recreation but simply attempting to have some sort of defense when I'm feeling really rough.",1

I tend to be very sensitive to klonopin and 0.25mg leaves me sitting around with no anxiety - or motivation.

Some days after I stopped the klonopin, I started feeling very anxious for several days, but nothing too extreme. Thankfully it subsided, but then I had an outpatient surgery about a week later, where they gave me 15mg of Valium and some faster-acting injection (I have no idea what it was,) along with an Rx for 10 5mg Valium pills, with instructions to take one to two per night to help me sleep, including the surgery night. They also gave me an Rx for 5 hydrocodone pills which I did not use.

While taking the Valium, I felt like a zombie. A day or two after finishing the pills, I had some of the most intense anxiety of my life. I felt *incredibly* worried about a few specific things, and had a strong feeling that I was **doomed** and spent about 18 hours per day anxiously doomscrolling, sleeping about 3 hours per day. The anxiety and insomnia rose for several days, peaking on Tuesday where I called my therapist and we talked for three hours because he was so worried about me. That was after talking to a relative for 2 hours. The talking seemed to calm me down at least during the conversations.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the anxiety has been lessening, but I am still pretty anxious, and still feeling insomnia as well. I flushed my remaining klonopin down the toilet, and the hydroxycodone will soon join it there.

Do you think my anxiety spikes may have been was related to the benzos? Do you have any recommendations for riding out this anxiety? I feel like I will be normal again in about a week, but right now I’m still in a bad place.",3

It’s been almost 14 months since I took my last Valium after a couple years of heavy abuse. The withdrawals were absolutely soul crushing. Multiple daily panic attacks the first month, a brief period I felt fine and thought that was it. Oh man was I wrong, the withdrawals struck back at full force and it came to the point I was not able to stay at home alone with my 2 year old daughter because I was not able to look after her, so my girlfriend had to take time off work.

The months went and I had shorter periods of feeling better followed by longer periods of feeling horrible, panic attacks, burning skin, losing my mind(paranoia) couldn’t leave the house, some trips to the ER certain I had heart attacks/brain tumor and stroke(I’m 27) I lost a total of 14kg(30lbs) over this period!

Around 8 months after my last Valium I finally thought it was over after 3-4 weeks of feeling almost normal, I had even started working out again and . Once again the withdrawals came back at full force and I collapsed. I became severely depressed and suicidal. It came to the point I thought about ending my life every day. I talked to my doctor and she started me on Sertraline(Zoloft)

That was early May and since that I have not had a single panic attack, haven’t even came close. I’ve gained 8kg(17lbs) and my relationship with my girlfriend and daughter is functional again. Sure I have bouts of light depression, and my libido is pretty fucked, it’s not a magic pill.. but my life took a 180 since the first day I took Sertraline. I’m working out and eating well, anxiety is pretty much at a zero, I get shit done and I can confidently say that Sertraline saved my life.

I’m not going to go into how it works here but please feel free to ask me questions. Not everyone can power through this, if you can that’s great, but if you can’t there is a possible solution.",7

Decided not to do heart drugs as they are harsh and don’t cure it and I’m young and to do a minimally invasive surgery called an ablation that actually cures this no more high heart rate spikes forcing me into panic attacks. Does anyone here also have a heart arrhythmia and trying to taper ??? I’m holding my taper till a month after recovery time from surgery to be safe! Love you all stay strong !,4

Longtime lurker i love this community. 
Anyway, i been on and off etizolam and others Rc benzodiazepines since 2017 with a 6 months break in 2018-2019 due to a seizure ( probably flualprazolam related). 

Now, everyday i take between 4-5 mg of diazepam ( since 2018) a day ( prescribed and i started at 10mg) and 1,5mg etizolam (.5 midday and 1 mg at night) and i slipped last year and consumed diclazepam at night, i tapered solo and I’m down to a 1/8 of a blotter wich is about 2 mg of diazepam. 

I want to get rid of my etizolam and diclazepam consumption.. for the beginning, i don’t want to live forever with diazepam but for the moment it helps me since i dont abuse it.

I know, it don’t seems that difficult to kick the diclazepam, but i don’t know i think it scares me, since i already had a seizure. I want to kick diclazepam wich is the goal the most ""reachable"" at the moment, etizolam will come next.  

I feel like  daily etizolam and diclazepam are preventing my life from moving forward. 

I don’t know what i’m looking for telling my story but anyway have a good day yall

I stopped taking them now for about 5 days after I ate about 25 5mg or so (in 2-3 weeks) and I've noticed my muscles spasming all over my body. Nothing too crazy but like just twitches like when your eye twitches but all over my body.

Is this going to go away and what can I do to help it?

I realise I shouldn't stop taking benzos abruptly but I didn't think it was a long period of time to taper down. I just wanted to stop taking them before things got too bad.

I haven't noticed much other withdrawal symptoms other than some pretty rough anxiety.

How bad did I fuck up? It's too late to start a small taper now correct?

Any help will be appreciated. Kinda worried tbh

Edit: I have 23 5mg tablets left. Should I start a small taper even though I haven't taken any for 5 days? And if so how much?",2

I've had a script for Xanax for ~15 years, ever since I had my first panic attack and started suffering from severe depression. I always enjoyed how Xanax made me feel, but for the first  ~8 years I stuck to my script, no abuse.

It all changed when a friend gave me Adderall one night. I loved it, and wanted more, so I searched online to see if there was anything comparable that wasn't controlled, which is how I discovered RCs.

I started taking RC stimulants, and quickly realized my Xanax script was not enough to get me to sleep and stave off anxiety, so I started with RC benzos.

Since then, I've been all over the place, from abusing clonazolam (incredibly strong) to a year without benzos at all to sticking to my script to ocassioanlly using RC benzos. I've gone through more withdrawals than I can count; somehow I never had a seizure or anything serious, but went through some horrendous times.

I recently showed my doctor the Ashton manual and convinced my doctor to switch me to valium so I could taper off.

But damn, it is so hard. Valium doesn't really give me any relief, only prevents withdrawals. I crave the feeling of strong benzos that sedate me and melt away my anxiety, and honestly I can't imagine life without them. Even though I want desperately to get off of them, I also desperately want to order some strong RC shit so I can relax and actually sleep (I have terrible insomnia).

Even during my year off of them, I thought about them constantly. I can't even relax without having some by my side. I feel like my mind will unravel without them I get so anxious, and benzos are keeping me sane. I obsess about them. I will record and not watch movies until I have benzos because I feel like I can't  enjoy anything without them. 

Have any of you felt like this? How do you put those cravings aside? How can anyone not crave the tranquility that benzos provide? Has anyone who was addicted actually stopped wanting to take benzos? I just can't see myself forgetting about them.

I'm currently attempting to taper but am failing because Valium does practically nothing for me. I never imagined a stupid l substance could could control my life like this, but it has. I see very little hope that I will not crave them for the rest of my life.

Has anyone been in this psychologically deep and actually managed to stop wanting to take them?

Edit: FWIW, earlier today I called a therapist office, and they are in the process of pairing me with a substance abuse/anxiety/depression therapist. I hope I hear back soon. Ive seen therapists before but I was never honest with them so it did very little to help, but this time, I'm going to be an open book. I want this chapter of my life to be over. I used to be a very chill, fun person, but I feel like a shell of my former self. I want me back.",12

tl;dr:  I was on clonazepam 1mg 2x day for about 10 years.  Before that I was on alprazolam 1mg as needed for a few years.  They were prescribed for GAD.  ""Tapered"" too fast and having horrible withdrawals.  Considering reinstating 7 months after taper began. 

My psychiatrist suggested I discontinue clonazepam because of the risk of early-onset dementia with long-term use, especially in women.  However, he thought it best to not discontinue immediately because of the added stress of Covid.  After a scary incident where I lost an entire day which extensive medical testing could not find a cause for, I informed my dr I wanted to go off it regardless.  He said it would take awhile which I was fine with.  In the past I discontinued Lyrica without much difficulty.  

First cut he took me down 50% (I now know that was WAY too drastic).  Six weeks later he cut another 50% of that dosage, taking .5mg once a day.  Six weeks after that he instructed me to take .25mg only as needed when anxiety was 8 or higher on a scale of 1-10.  Six weeks later he stopped prescribing it and started me on hydroxyzine as needed and ever-higher doses of lamotrigine until now when I'm taking 300mg extended release at bedtime.  At that time I finally thought to research online to at least find out how long withdrawals would last.  That took me to the Ashton Manual and then to being very pissed off at the whole experience.

From two days after the first cut the withdrawals were pure hell.   I won't type out all the symptoms I have because I suspect most people here are familiar with them.  I informed my dr and he said this was normal and would get easier over time.  It hasn't.  I do have short windows of a few hours where I'm more functional but those are few and far between.  My house is a disaster (tried to hire a cleaning company to help, they left saying it was a disaster and never came back).  My property is a disaster, I'm a disaster.  

I can't live like this.  I've only made it this long with the support of my husband and his patience is wearing thin.  Looking for some input before bringing it up to my dr because he clearly doesn't understand proper tapering.  Thanks so much.",8

No, actually, I did not consent to taking pills that would fuck me up and make me worse for 7 years. By definition I did not consent, because nobody fucking told me. In fact, studies had not yet shown that benzos for PTSD are a shitty idea, so how would I have known? I was doing what the treatment center you took me to for post-partum PTSD told me to do, and what an exceptionally bad psychiatrist told me to do.

If I’d had any idea what these pills would do to me, if I’d had any idea no one is supposed to take them for more than two weeks, if I’d had any idea that I would walk like a zombie through my kid’s childhood, while my PTSD symptoms got worse, and that then I’d go through hell for a year and a half (and counting) getting off them, no fucking way I would have taken them.

So yes, it is okay for me to describe becoming dependent on benzos as “something that happened to me.” Something that, before I understood the scope of exactly how bad they were for me, I took the initiative to get off of. Me becoming dependent on this med was NOT MY CHOICE.

And fuck you, family member who had a drug issue with the kind of drugs people take for fun, for telling me that I’m playing the victim. You did fun drugs for years, and it affected me negatively when I got in fights with family members defending you, but damn if I remember you doing anything like “amends” to me when you got clean. So fuck off with your bullshit, and your half-understanding of what I’ve been dealing with.

 “Did someone pour the pills down your throat?” Was I in a position to say no to anything at the treatment center you took me to for postpartum? Where I spent a year doing therapy and sucking down these fucking pills that nobody raised any red flags about?

I’m “selfish?” I HAVE A BRAIN INJURY from these pills. And my brain wasn’t right before then. I have had PTSD since I was a little kid, and have been roiling in worsening, nightmarish symptoms for years, in absolute hell. Fuck you for your assumptions and your judgment and your telling me I need to make amends.

EDIT: I can’t believe I forgot to say it’s been seven months since I finished my 13 month taper. I probably have another year of rebound anxiety to go, but thank god, THANK GOD, I am benzo free.

EDIT TWO: I was on Xanax, 4 mg/day for 7 years.

EDIT THREE: I just remembered that when I entered treatment they had me sign a contract that I would take all medications as prescribed by my psychiatrist. I DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE and I did what I was supposed to do.",37

I am currently going through huge life trauma and dealing with serious panic disorder. Had a life changing allergic reaction to vaccine and I have several chronic conditions and am already weak  and sick. Basically bed bound for three months.

I was put on Ativan to help me get onto Zoloft but I had a terrible reaction to the Zoloft and had to stop. My gp was on holiday and the next person I could see was a psych. By this time I’d been on Ativan (between 2.5 and 1.5) for five weeks. He said I’m too weak to try on another ssri unless I have a bad reaction again and we need to deal with the panic disorder. 

1. He’s prescribed 1mg clonazipam for three months daily. I haven’t made the switch yet but I’m having really bad nausea. I think it’s ever since the Zoloft but I’ve been off that two weeks and it seems to be getting worse. Is it my anxiety or could it be the Ativan? 

2. Rock and hard place. I really don’t want to be on benzos at all and am especially scared on clonazipam. Anxiety so severe I don’t know if I can taper yet. So devestated to be getting sicker when I’m trying to heal. If I can get a second opinion from another psychiatrist is there a ‘better’ benzo to be put on?

It actually calms my anxiety. I find myself waking up early since I started tapering. First few days of jumping from 40 to 35 gave me ringing in ears but that’s about it. Went pretty well so I was ready for my next jump. I’m somewhat depressed but that’s normal for someone who came off Kratom and tapering benzos. All prescribed by my doc. I don’t see her for another month but worried about sleep, seizure threshold, etc. I am not asking for medical advice just want some support I guess. Am I doing the right thing?

I only take it at nighttime to sleep, but I am completely dependent on it. I would like to take 2mg for one night, 1 mg tomorrow then go cold turkey.

I get this feeling like I'm in third person or at 50% brain capacity when I stop. 

Does anyone have advice for getting sleep during this time? Is that safe to stop cold turkey so soon? I don't take it throughout the day at all. I have basically just used it as a sleep aid.

I appreciate any advice or anecdotes. I have a big event this Saturday that I really need to be feeling at least somewhat decent for and it will be an anxiety inducing event.

Thanks.",3

I had a decent summer. Had windows and waves. I am having a wave right now which is why I need to reach out. 

I am having a hard time controlling the negative thoughts this time. Like the feeling of I may need to get back on meds. My depression has returned and I almost had a panic attack yesterday which scares me that I am getting sick again. I am also having nightmares which is new. I usually don't remember my dreams.

Its just so hard for me to believe that after months I am still going to deal with this. I go to counseling weekly. I do not take any supplements anymore. Just a antistress vitamin once in awhile and some CBD. I want this wave to pass so bad.

I hope everyone else is doing well. I know this is hard as hell and im right there with you. I guess I just need some words of encouragement.",3

I am coming off of 1 year, 2mg Ativan prescription and was curious about other people's timeline.

I did a rough taper and jumped at .5mg. What's weird is that I actually felt great for a few days after jumping, like better than I ever felt while tapering. Restlessness, insomnia, and anxiety, but nothing too bad. However, I slowly had anxiety creep into me and it got pretty dark by day 13. On day 13 I screwed up, went back for 3 days, then jumped right off again. I'm now back to day 8 without taking any and my anxiety is very bad but manageable for the time being.

When did you guys feel the worst anxiety after a jump or even CT? A week in, 3 days, one month? 

Thanks an advance! Trying so hard to stay strong and have faith I'll get better.",5

I pass out and wake up confused and with a headache (better then phenobarbital at least) at cold turkeyed.

They have been off the clonazolam for 3 days now. They say they feel good. If they don’t succeed this time they may consider going to rehab. It seems as though my friends source for clonazolam is acting strange cutting off access to supply. So, they may try just going cold turkey risking seizures, heart palpitations, and death or they may go to rehab.   


My friend says the stigma behind drugs and going to rehab makes it so hard with hospital and doctors. My friend is highly debating going cold turkey and risking death rather then have a life time stigma on a computer file on every doctor, pharmacy, hospital, psychiatric ward, and so on.

So uncomfortable (last time even months later i could easily wait till 9 pm to take my 0.5.

I found an anti-drug psychiatrist who is an expert in getting people of psych drugs. He got me off lexapro during quarantine and went at MY PACE letting me gage my discomfort and pace myself. So he switched me to 10 mg valium at night. I just took my first dose and i feel as though it is much stronger than the 0.5 xanax. Is my doctor’s equivalency off? I have seen sources say 0.5=5mg of valium; ive seen 0.5=10mg valium and even 0.5=7mg or something in the middle. I just dont want this to be making me more dependent and upping my dose as i want to get off smoothly but want to make sure im always going forward. Thoughts?

Have a DUI and drug tests coming up next month/possibly at any time within now and then. Need a psychiatrist. Need advice. Terrified.,"I desperately need someone who can help me. I am terrified of going to detox and just being put on a short taper and having long term brain damage. I'm currently on .8mg per day. Still trying my best to taper.

I was wondering... I'm in South Carolina, in the upstate area, and I'm not sure how open they'd be about research chemical benzos. I've figured out the equivalent dose to what I'm taking is about 6mg of Klonopin. Should I just tell a psychiatrist that I've been taking street Klonopin? Instead of coming clean about the Flubromazolam? I know a lot of times I've heard non-understanding psychiatrists will be willing to help you get off of street pressed drugs but if it's anything research chemical related, they'll basically say there's nothing they can do and refer you to a medical detox. I don't know what to do. I found a doctor that's 3 hours away and insanely expensive that practices the Ashton method, but I'm not sure if even they would be ok with research chemicals.

Even if 6mg isn't exact, I also just need some sort of excuse for benzos to be showing up in my system on a drug test. I've been tapering for a while, even before the DUI. So even if whatever taper they put me on isn't enough at first, eventually it will be.

Also, I do have some Clonazolam (not Clonazepam but I've heard the metabolites are similar). That's what I was addicted to first, but switched to Flubromazolam because the half life is longer. And benzos are indeed showing up on quality urine tests I've bought online.

Any thoughts?

Edit: Things are getting better! The post-DUI guilt is slowly going away. Thank god. I still feel bad about it, but it's not the scary thing it was before. Time. Time heals all. Please don't kill yourself like I was considering doing when I posted this. Also, I found a doctor willing to help me taper down. But if your tolerance is high, don't he honest with them, I'm sorry to say. No pharmacy on earth is going to give you 20mg of Xanax worth of Valium. Some of the tapering you're going to have to do with another substance and slowly get off of that and onto your doctor's medicine.",1

My psychiatrist prescribes me 45 0.5mg of Klonopin every month and a half, with the instructions being to take one every day. After a while, I noticed that just one pill had no real effect on me, so without consulting my doctor, I started taking two pills. 

Here’s the situation. I have generalized anxiety disorder and my doctor also prescribes me Lexapro, which works very well 99% of the time, so I don’t actually take the Klonopin on a daily basis. I usually only take the Klonopin in situations where I have to deal with situations I’m phobic about - I have a fear of flying, for example. I also have claustrophobia and a fear of heights. I’m working with my therapist on CBT and exposure therapy, but it’s taking a while.

Anyway, long story short: my Lexapro usually takes care of my GAD. In certain phobic situations, I end up abusing Klonopin by taking more than prescribed. I don’t want to do this anymore. If I took Klonopin, like 3mg a day, twice a week for two weeks, what are the odds that I will have withdrawal symptoms? My doctor will absolutely not give me another prescription until the 45 days are up.

Thank you.",0

     I started off 3 months ago with clonazolam, started off low but it quickly got out of control to the point of taking probably close to 1.5 to 2mg a day.  I work a good job and have a family to take care of and realized how sloppy i was getting, so after 2 months of this i flushed the clonazolam and started a diclazapam taper.  

I started off probably higher than I needed to around 10mg a day, realized this was too high, and finally over the course of a month worked my way down to 2mg twice daily.  

So total 3 months usage, and for reasons I won't get into I have had to basically CT from the 4mg daily diclazapam.  I am on day 13, the WD didn't really kick in until day 7 (due to long half life).  At day 7, the WD got pretty intense (muscle pain, confusion, jaw clenching, no sleep, social anxiety etc.) so I managed to get 30 .5mg klonopins.

So starting day 7 I began taking .25mg klonopin in the morning and .5mg at night, and at first it brought relief and I was able to sleep.  Now the last 2 days the relief seems to be less and im getting no sleep. 

Obviously these 30 klonopins won't last long, and it will be back to CT.  I plan to lower the klonpin I'm taking after a week, then again after another week til its gone.   I do have a massive amount of gabapentin that I can use, but it doesn't help a ton. 

How long will the acute symptoms last in your opinion?     Ive got massive benzo belly/constipation, crazy insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, and Ive noticed since I began tapering a month ago Ive lost about 20 pounds despite no change in eating habits (my appetite is normal) .  Just trying to figure out what else to expect and for how long.

I know that the best thing to do would be to seek medical help or detox, but ive been to several doctors and all just tell me to go to detox.  Unfortunately that's not possible, for multiple reasons.

A week ago severe anxiety and insomnia set in. No sleep panic attacks all day. They put me on Ativan and tried to start Zoloft but I had a terrible reaction to the Zoloft and it made me sicker overall. Because my body is so weak my psychiatrist wants to just switch me to 1mg clonazipam for the next few months to calm my system hopefully while I recover some physical strength. I’m terrified of things getting worse. My anxiety is very high level so I don’t think it’s possible to just pass on this. Horrible situation and reading everything here just makes it all so much worse.,2

In fact, I just realized I am now exactly where I was in early July again due to having to updose a few times due to multiple major stressful life events. The seemingly temporary updoses here and there really added up. I am feeling discouraged and very hopelessly depressed right now. 

For reference, I am taking 1mg of Xanax a day. .5mg in morning, .25mg in afternoon, and .25mg in evening. 

I’m getting so tired of the interdose wd, nightmares, feeling like shit, and timing everything I do around my doses and taper schedule. 

I’m so scared it’ll never get better. I don’t know how to manage the psychological dependence I have too. I often feel like I mentally *need* an extra dose sometimes when I’m experiencing extreme symptoms or insomnia and this makes it really hard to stick with a strict taper schedule.

I have propranolol and use it for physical symptoms in place of Xanax but I struggle for a solution for the mental dependency and side effects. 

I hope this post was useful for someone to maybe not make the same mistakes as me. If anyone has been through something similar I would love to chat or hear your story to have some hope.

On these meds it's hard to write well. If you take the time to read this I really appreciate it. Any advice or insight would be amazing.

I'm on both medications for pain control. I've been on them for 3 years. I'm on 15 mg a day of Valium.  I got a surgery 6 months ago that I believe has brought the pain down that I may be able to taper off some more of the medication. Hopefully.

I tapered from 1800 mg of Gabapentin to 600 mg. It's been exactly one month. And I believe 90% of the withdrawals are now gone from that. I'm exstatic! Thank God. This means so much for me. It means the surgery was a success in some fashion. And that I get a percentage of my mind and body back. (I'm working with percentages here to rebuild my life.)

My pain is all nerve pain I have a condition called Trigeminal Neuralgia, type 2. It's constant pain. It's nickname is the suicide disease, 75% of people try to kill themselves. I was part of that 75%. The pain is that bad.  The condition is considered the most painful condition known to Medical Science. 

 I want to try to get off some of the valium. Valium keeps the majority of the nerve pain away. One of the triggers for trigeminal Neuralgia is anxiety. Even mild anxiety is horrific it causes extreme pain. The reason for this is because your arteries and veins are pumping around your injured nerve endings and when you're experiencing anxiety it's irritating those nerves. 

So I'm extremely wary coming off a benzo with this condition. You can imagine the anxiety I'm going to experience with a condition like this. At the very best I predict I will have ""rebound pain"". This pain will make anyone want to die. It's in your face it's constant it's inhumane. But I will also have all the other symptoms that come along with benzodiazepine withdrawals to deal with. I went through it once a long long time ago. I remember laying there and my heart pounding out of my chest, a drop of a pillow sounded like a bomb. Every bad thing that ever happened to me in my life played over and over in my mind on repeat. (And I've lived a pretty traumatic life so there's plenty of material to think about).  Couldn't sleep for days maybe weeks. Can't remember now. It's been a really long time.

So I'm unsure what to do. Should I submit myself to a psych ward, and have them taper me? Is that even a possibility? I don't have any money else I would probably have professionals do this in a rehabilitation center. (I'm not ashamed if I have to do a phyc ward at all whatsoever, my ego is not involved in this. All I want to do is get better no matter how I do it). But a rehab is not feasible as it's so expensive. And I don't even think a psych ward would taper me, I don't think insurance would cover it for very long.

Or should I buy a bunch of food. Block out all my windows in my apartment. And just make sure I get nutrients to the best of my ability daily and hold on for dear life? My fear is I will be pushed over the edge. I also am losing my vision in one eye due to severe dry eye caused by a virus that lingered in my eye for 10 weeks ( Due to these meds). My body and mind has taken a beaten because of these medications.

So if I'm going to have constant diarrhea unable to sleep etc etc I'm going to lose more and more vision which is traumatic in itself and I don't have a way to combat that. Not in the condition I will be in. The only thing I can think of for that is put gel in my eye and I'll be spending whatever time period I'm withdrawing with one eye. Just laying there. I can't watch TV in that condition or distract myself in any way besides listening to music. 
Even getting one hour less of sleep makes that eye get extremely dry scratches the cornea and I lose more eyesight. It's very scary. It's been causing me a lot of anxiety even on this much valium. 

But I need off of these medications I rather be dead. If I start to taper and the pain is too severe then I'll go for another risky surgery. Because a life on these medications is just not worth living. I'm starting not to even feel human anymore.

So as you can see I'm in a pretty sorry state. But I'm remaining hopeful, ANY advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",17

I get painful almost paralyzing physical anxiety. Unusual phenomenon. I can barely have a phone conversation.

Yet somehow I’ve got to be highly functional Friday for hours and a the same few days the week after. I have huge life changing responsibilities.

I am now at .7mg k which I take across 3 doses at 10:30am;5:30pm;10;30pm. Somehow these 3 individual amounts have evolved a bit unevenly due to needing a little more or less here or there for eating & sleeping.  After months of tapering much of this is barely effective. The .23mg dinnertime dose helps me me eat. 

In order to get some relief I’m strongly considering merging morning & dinner doses? Temporarily? It wouldn’t be increasing total each day but may whack out my daily blood serum levels. I know I’m chasing my tail here but not sure what else to do. 

Out of desperation, seeking any advice from my fellow warriors.",3

He offered me one as we were hanging out as we usually do. We both had gotten off work and he picked me up in his car and I tried it for the first time. It was fun and I bought some, and we would hang out once in a while and take some xanax pills, smoke weed and play video games. I saw no harm in it in the beginning. He warned me about it and I went to read about it too to make sure I wasn’t getting myself into something stupid. I’d limit myself to max 1mg a week, so just one pill. Sometimes, I’d take 2, cause heck. Whenever I felt, that the effect wasn’t the same, I’d have a T-break. 

I thought he did the same. Unfortunately, as time went by, his personal problems became too overwhelming. I won’t go into detail about his problems, but I could understand why he felt like he did. So he increased the intake of xanax to cope. Not medically prescribed or anything. He got them through a pusher. His depression came hand in hand with COVID. Everything aligned for him to fall into a deep hole. I always tried to talk to him and motivate him to make a change in his life, but before I knew, he was physically addicted. He then tried to taper off and kept lying about that he was clean, but you just know when someone is in deep shit by looking at their face. His eyes were empty for a long time. 

He went to sleep yesterday and didn’t wake up today. He had puked blood in his sleep and died. Still don’t know the exact reason as he’s undergoing autopsy, but this is a way for me to get rid of the pain and put them into words instead. 

If you have anyone in the same state, do not let them be alone. Seek professional help and force them. That’s what I wish I had done at least. Easier said than done and hindsight is 2020. I just wish I had done more. Even though, I won’t put the blame on myself. At the time, he didn’t seem to be saveable. But, it’s a shame. What if I had called him every day? Would that have made a difference? don’t tell me it’s not my fault in the comments. i know.",22

Like any other substance it controlled my thinking, along with worrying about how I would obtain the pills, I was banished from my local CVS and things got really bad when the janky Mom and Pop Pharmacy in the rough part of town began to give me a hard time and feel ashamed of my use disorder and began cutting me off. I knew the dangers of withdrawal (seizures) and with the help of family put myself in treatment which I highly suggest to those that can, I began a month long taper where I began to go through the hellish nightmare, yet with  spiritual guidance and the help of fellow addicts I began to feel hope. 

When I got home I began meeting with a psychiatrist who quickly got me off a large amount of unnecessary medications my previous Doctor had put me on (blood pressure, diabetic). And got me on 150 mg of Zoloft which seems to be helping, as well as gabapentin and hydroxizine. Fortunately my previous ferocious appetite subsided and I was able to lose 30 pounds, putting me away from many risky weight related issues. Unfortunately when I went to visit a second opinion doctor he misread my irritability as something more serious than benzo withdrawal, he had the paramedics come and take me to the hospital where they monitored my heart and like many can attest to, “found nothing wrong with me” they offered me Ativan which I fortunately declined.

I’m not here to say that I’m all “cured” but being able to do basic chores throughout the day without having horrific rebound anxiety has happened. The support I’ve gotten from fellow addicts from treatment has given me hope, as well a distraction from my own anguish.

Also anyone here take meds for ADHD?,"Background: I was cutting my dose of klonopin down for over a year. At some point I got nervous to make my next cut so I stayed at a certain dose got over a month. Then I think I went into tolerance withdrawals. This happened in March and it was pure hell. I basically went psychotic, suicidal, and had every withdrawal symptom imaginable. I tried to push through but I swear with each day, it did not get better. By day 10 I gave up. I called my doctor in a crazy mental state and he said to stabilize I would have to take triple my dose for a few days. I did that (took .5mg 3x a day). Then I felt stable and stuck with .5mg a day ever since. Some other background: I have bipolar II so when I’m hypomanic, the Klonopin does nothing for me. Once I’m out of the hypomania, I start to feel it working again. But this is what’s weird: I’ll take my dose and it’ll help me sleep/calm me down, but I’m never crazy tired.

Another thing I was hoping to get advice on. I was diagnosed with ADHD but refused meds for a while out of fear that it would make my anxiety worse. But now I’m at a point where I feel like it’s really effecting me.  Would adding a stimulant do more Damage?",3

After a tough week last week, I’ve stabilized and am feeling hopeful! I am no longer pushing myself to taper as quickly as possible; I had some relatively intense symptoms that put me in my place. I was lowering by 10% every week… at the end of the 4th week, I wasn’t feeling quite ready to make another cut yet, but I did it anyway. Highly don’t recommend 🙅🏻‍♀️ 

I had an episode of violent shaking/ shivering last week (my last post), roaring tinnitus, nausea, headaches, sensory overload, etc. For a few days, I was wondering if I’d start feeling normal again or if I had fucked myself by going too fast. I’m here to tell you, learn from my mistakes. Don’t make another cut just to stay on schedule. Even if things are going really well, probably don’t speed up or try to push it. I was trying to stay on schedule instead of holding at my dose for an extra week… I made myself suffer to just try to save a WEEK. Not worth it. 

Also, one thing that I learned here really helped me: if you start to suffer, really try not to updose. Last Tuesday/ Wednesday I was really considering upping my dose and I’m so glad I didn’t. I just held on tight, spent some extra time in bed, took lots of baths and focused on self care. I also spent at least 30min a day on my acupressure mat, which has never felt better. For me, it took less than a week to feel ok at this lower dose. :) I’m so glad to say that my tinnitus, while still present, has eased up a lot, and most of my other symptoms have gone for now.

Whoever is reading this, I hope this post finds you well. Hang in there. ❤️ we can do this.",4

Worst Trigger to Panic Attacks! My Story","Was on ativan for 2mg a day to deal with loss of family back in Jan to may ,

Decided to wean off to 1mg, 0.5 mg a week before my flight, was doing ok would only have heart palpatation if cut too much at a time, and then shit hit the fan, on the day of my flight, one of my arm all the way to my shoulder suddenly just became weak, like i couldnt really use it or lift it, something was off. at the time i thought it was just a ulnar nerve injury i had 2 weeks back, and then it continues a few days later it wasnt numb but it became completely soft as if a light switch turned off, it was insane, i have never had that feeling in my life!

It freaked me out, and i guess luckily because i also had some medicine patches in my arm that caused the same arm to swell i was taken to the ER while in quarantine and given sedatives cos i also had the first and worst panic attack in my life like a bad zombie movie where all the medics were in hazmat suits and non covid patients were wheeled to a parking lot for treatment. over the course of the week i slept and continue to eat my pain killers that made me sleepy and before the 2 weeks i gained strength back and also recovered from my ativan withdraw.

Fast fwrd to last week , I am a healthy bunny, I swim and play tennis, yoga, hikes, normal caffeine consumption, doing well except i was still depressed from lockdown, family passing that I tho why not cant hurt to have 1-2 ativan at night recreationally and to help me sleep, so i did realized quickly after a week and a half my heart palpatations were starting to come back and so i stopped and was doing well replacing with 10mg melatonin at night.

Here is how shit went down,  Then last thursday i went to a cafe to get work done, and had a latte. Before i left my house i also had a sip of home made coffee nothing much. Everything was fine 2 hrs in the cafe, i get home on my couch and boom both my arms start to feel weak, panic sets in, i proceed to pee and shit like 20 times, and feeling dizzy and disoriented, i could not do anything but lie down, breathe, chug water to get this out of my system. it was if i went into overdrive. I rest it off, seem like am ok, then next day on way out of subway out of nowhere i become jelly and start to panic again, and feeling disassociated with my surrounding and had to sit down and do deep breathing (this shit works) and then proceeded home asap to lie down for the remaining of the night. As soon as i sleep i feel better but no, now i was unable to go anywhere outside my house, as soon as i got in elevator i got dizzy and scared, drs ride with taxis i can barely stay put and want to go home immediately and panic.

To make things worse neurologists and general drs dont know whats going on even when i mention benzo withdraw, so after a few hundred dollars wasted and feeling shit scared (never google symptoms while out in public) i went back to doing some research on this group , confirmed what i was experiencing completely normal (hence making me more calm, that i wasnt dying or on verge of seizure) and now plan to just continue to chug lots of water, ginger, vitamin D, fruit for the next few weeks.

I have never tho of the term, \*Crippling Disability too much as im generally pretty healthy, but to experience it thru a substance withdraw that was meant to help u with ur anxiety is all sorts of fucked up. I cannot work, I panic when my spouse leaves the house, I couldnt even walk inside my house for a  day or 2, and is only starting to head out cos of drs appointments, i legit have to put on the calm app and meditate when im in cabs, its crazy and i dont know if itll ever get better, but knowing that this is from benzos and not MS or neuro damage at least for now the time being has put my mind at ease just a bit. Any shared tips would be appreciated, I have started yoga again last night, and i plan to keep doing yoga and even start with yoga classes outside to retrain my brain to get used to outside noises.",8

I've been reading everyone's posts and I gained much needed motivation to go through with this, and the courage to post here. I'll try to keep it simple:

I've been on Lorazepam (Ambien) for what I believe are 10 years or more. It started as taking 2.5 from my father's dosage just to be able to sleep to actually being prescribed with 2x2.5 two times a day, so a total of 5mg. I also occasionally take more than one when I feel like blacking out from real life.

My psych doctor drew up a taper plan for me and I'm thinking about beginning tomorrow. But I'm shit scared. Once I forgot three doses when I was taking one daily and I felt terrible, nausea, dizzy, brain zaps, cold sweats, shivers. I'm terrified of feeling like that for four weeks or more.

The taper is removing 1/4 of the 2.5mg pill weekly, so by week for I'd be on 0mg. What do you think about this plan? How was your taper, was it slower or faster than this plan? And how did you feel during the taper and how long after it did the symptoms last? I stopped taking Efexor one month ago and I still feel like crap.

Thank you and for all of you going through this hell, I send you courage and strength, from the heart.",7

My digestion is all messed up like it was months ago during the early days of withdrawal and I haven't slept a single good night since I took the last dose. It feels like i'm back at day 60 of withdrawal. Like I've been set back 120 days of progress. I am really hoping that I'll bounce back in a few days. Just wanted to let all the people on this site know that literally one slip up can completely set you back months. If I am overreacting please let me know. Maybe i'll just have bad symptoms for the next day or two and feel back to how I was before I took the xanax?

I’m seriously need on how to taper down on my benzo use because clearly, I am abusing it and the first ever mistake I did was…to try it for recreational purpose.

What am I taking? 
Xanax 
Valium
Klonopin 
Ativan
Midazolam
Etizolam
Mirtazapine 

Dosage? 
1-5mg max daily to sleep (usually start taking in the evening, to help me sleep)
As for RC, 15-30mg. 

How long have i been abusing? 
5-7 months of heavy use

I know, i am in deep shit because of that usage. I got my drugs without being diagnosed or prescribe with any disorder. Is it a wise choice to see a psychiatrist from a government hospital, tell him/her of my situation and hopefully agree to a taper plan? Mainly, I have my doc as my accountability partner, prescribed proper medicine to taper off?    

My concerns;
- Being forced into government rehab
- Lose my job
- I’m in Asia, doctors might view it different??

First of all excuse my English, I am not a native speaker (I am helping myself a little from the translator in some words) and also forgive me for complaining and referring badly to the country where I live, I love my country but unfortunately it is reality.

I will try to summarize everything because I write this in a state of great anxiety and bad condition in general.

I am 20 years old almost 21 and since I was 18 I have been abusing substances, first cannabis then together with alcohol, \* remember that my only options for weed is the one I get in the ghetto and it has an exaggerated amount of thc so the less more high you stay \* I clarify this because when consuming a cannabis so high in thc and little cbd the side effects exceed the benefits that I acquire from smoking, it should be clarified that I am diagnosed with OCD, GAD and recently ADHD. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of ADHD was in my 20s and I always had it as a child, but living in a country so poorly educated about mental health, I was never diagnosed correctly at school, I was only marginalized as someone restless, mischievous and lazy. Since I was a child I was always very restless, lazy without being able to be constant in anything, wanting to eat the world but jumping from project to project without successfully completing any.

But I honestly never victimized or self-conscious and I honestly have no complaints about my childhood. All thanks to my great pillar that is my family, they were always there for me at all times. They and the controlversial religion, I live in a very, very religious country and I always rely on it. I was very religious as a child, my parents educated me by putting God at the center of everything.

But one of those pillars broke in my 17s when I first separated from the church, for being very toxic and fanatic, then I began to have many doubts about the existence of God and decided to have an agnostic position about it, but at once it began. an anxiety of fear to go to hell for not believing and things like that because they literally brainwashed me with all that fanatic shit.

Right there I began to flirt with cannabis, which made me very introspective and I liked it, I managed to overcome that fear that the church instilled in me but when I was almost 18 I met the damn anxiety that I never knew what it was and why I felt that way until I read About GAD in my mid-18 when I was already abusing cannabis and alcohol, in my last year of high school I reached the point of smoking half a joint in the morning along with a couple of drinks of alcohol, there I knew I needed help, a psychiatrist unprofessional I prescribe bromazepam without warning me how addictive benzos are, I did not abuse much of bromazepam but when 2020 arrived I decided to make cold turkey with everything and then I met my second demon, the damn OCD, I could not last more than two weeks and I decided to go to another psychiatrist, I was prescribed with rivotril 2 mg ONLY x two weeks and one ssri, I decided not to take ssri and abuse clonazepam in doses of up to 4-6mg daily because in my country it is too easy to have access to prescriptions for controlled substances. In short, I abused half of 2020 of rivos, dxm, weed. Until one day I made a mixture of dxm, tramadol and when I was taking paroxetine and mirtazapine it gave me a serious serotonin sindorm because at the time I was very ignorant about it, in short, I was almost left with serious sequelae and flirtation close to death, even a couple of times more until the confinement arrived in my country and that in part put a brake on me also that I decided to gradually stop benzos for the entire other half of 2020, and well, 2021 arrives, I am much better I was taking 20 mg of lexapro that helped me a lot but in my country pregabalin is otc so I abused it taking high doses on weekends until I decided to take ritalin and went back to clonazepam, both self-medicated, I abused little or almost no ritalin is more the first 3 months of 2021 were spectacular, I had completely given up alcohol and cannabis also for the first time in my life I was able to focus on studying and I managed to enter university, I was finally able to have a stable relationship with someone and I regained contact with many friends, in part all those achievements I owe to ritalin but I had to leave it because I had to go into detoxification because I had abused the damn benzos again, since May 2021 I have been reducing from 4 mg of clonazepam right now I am on 5 mg but in the course of all these months it has been a real hell in life because I had to leave the girl I loved, I did not want to submerge her with me in my spiral of self-destruction, I had returned to alcohol stronger than ever and substance abuse, I got away from everyone and immersed myself in my misery alone, until one day I said enough and decided to seek help almost shouting, for a month and two weeks I have been without drinking and almost a month without smoking but recently I was also diagnosed with adhd but I was not medically treated about it since the only drug available for such a condition in my country is methylphenidate and because I was coming out of substance abuse it was not prescribed for me, but until recently because I was very frustrated with not being able to be constant in anything, I decided to self-medicate again with ritalin but I feel a lot of guilt about it and since I am reducing two anxiety medications at the same time benzos (there are only 5 weeks left) and pregabaliana AKA lyrica (I am starting) gives me a I came down with a lot of anxiety after taking the only medication that helps me with my condition, it is very difficult to suffer from severe anxiety aggravated by substance abuse and pronounced adhd. Three weeks ago I had left the cold turkey pregabalin, serious mistake, I could not sleep for two days, I had never been awake so long, I do not want to go back to that moment so I will only say that it was the lowest I have felt in all my life, That decision made me totally unable to give my classes at the university so I decided to quit and three weeks have passed I resumed the pregabalin but to reduce it I am on 100 mg of zoloft that only helps my OCD and I am against the sword and the wall because I will go back to teaching, I will have to catch up and it is difficult for me to concentrate I do not think I will continue with ritalin unless it is prescribed by a professional but I do not know if I can do everything ...

If you have come this far, from the heart thank you very much for reading everything

I needed to vent a little and I do not know if this is the place, I wish that with this post many go to a professional before thinking about self-medicating and please do not fuck with benzos and that kind of addictive shit. From all the good vibes I wish you a good day and excuse my English :)",0

But that was over a week ago and since that time I've had the worst week of my life with Benzo withdrawals. I have had hallucinations, full on shakes, panic attacks that come in waves that last 24 hours, back and forth sweating/shaking. It has not diminished much over that time.

Today I did a little home circuit resistance training, for the first time in 51 days! I’ve only managed walks during my wave because it’s been absolutely brutal. Today, and for the last few days I’ve been in a window. The window isn’t 100% but I’m sleeping well and I can function somewhat during the day. The happiness that accompanies this little home workout is only, I imagine, the tip of the iceberg with things I wholeheartedly appreciate and will never take for granted again once I survive this. 

I’m expecting to head back into a wave again in the coming week because it’s my luteal phase. Can I just say that withdrawal is cruel enough, but suffering with endometriosis, adenomyosis and PMDD on top is criminal. Trying to enjoy this little window while it lasts. 

Sending you all good vibes. This sub is the only thing that gets me through sometimes.",15

About 10 mins or less after eating, food triggers my Central Nervous System to be hyper-activated, and affects not just horrendous physiological anxiety (vs psychological) but rational thinking, logic, focus, concentration, speech, etc.

Some foods like eggs, onions, bell peppers seem to be easier. 

I eat mostly keto/Mediterranean foods but do have whole grain bread, brown rice & potatoes on occasion. Low to no sugar or processed foods…lots of proteins - chicken, turkey, other meats, nuts, fruits, veggies, olive oil…no caffeine or alcohol 😞

Could this be a glutamate thing? I sure hope not, most foods naturally contain glutamate, some lower than others. That’s a tough diet. Histamines? Anything else?

Any experience or advice would be greatly appreciated! I know WD are crazy but hopefully we can make them just a little more tolerable to help survive this seemingly never ending nightmare.",3

(Recovery story in comments),"The calm from the anxiety I felt at the time made me a more giving and generous person. It made me want to reach out to friends and family and try to brighten the day of those around me.

THIS BENEFIT IS NOT WORTH THE TRADE OFF!

Throughout the year that I was addicted I was a shell of my former self. I never felt any super highs or super lows, just a constant middle ground of emotion. I essentially lost most of the memories I had gained over that year. My performance at work (while given confidently) was suffering to no end. I would forget basic tasks again and again.

I live in constant fear that my addictive personality will lure me back into the addict lifestyle but I implore you to weigh up the short term calm and anxiety relief you may feel with the long lasting effects on memory (which I still feel to this day over a year after recovery) and the effect it can have on your family. In my case the seizures brought on through withdrawal were the final straw that led me to finally coming clean and seeking the help I really needed

I had to relinquish my driving license for a year (I never had a car throughout any of my use), once it was on my medical record which has since had a knock on affect on my ability to find jobs further afield.

We all know that the withdrawal is incredibly awful. I personally went through it 4 times before coming out of the other side.

To those of you considering quitting or are going through withdrawal at the moment. Please stick with it. 

I would often come to this subreddit and read stories of others recover which would give me motivation that withdrawal ends and life without drugs is a life worth living.",20

 • Contacted my sleep doctor and planning to administer a taper program for Clonazepam, since other symptoms are not improving.

 • Do you think it's still advisable to taper? Or would it be better to tell my doctor to prescribe me with alternatives to help me sleep well instead of going back to Clonazepam?",2

My last dose was 10 days ago, yesterday and today I took 1mg Xanax to lessen symptoms.  For three years I took .5mg klonopin once a week and the past year I have taken 1mg klonopin daily.

The klonopin is really important to me, it made my life livable.  Somewhere around 4 years ago I developed a panic disorder that made it difficult to drive, work or do anything. For months I would have attacks every day thinking I was going to pass out or have a heart attack....the symptoms are real, one time I lost use of my legs.  Klonopin fixed that.

10 days ago my RX ran out and my doctor just retired.  Today I am feeling the effects of withdrawal and have to go to urgent care to get a new RX for the week until I find a new doctor.  I never knew there was withdrawal symptoms as I would routinely go 4-5 days without taking it if I didn't have any anxiety that week. 

My question is...should I try to completely get off of it with a new doctor?  It really helps me live a normal life, prior to taking it I was a very on edge person all the time, moody, panic attacks, everything was life or death. 

I didn't know klonopin could be dangerous....so I'm just not sure what my next steps are.",5

I'm expected to be at court sometime next month and I'm terrified they'll put me on probation. This is my first offense, I don't want to give too many details, but I'm taking 1.6mg of Flubro per day. Do you think it would be possible to rapid taper down without dying in just one month?

I'm so so so scared. The DUI didn't involve anyone else, honestly it was the most tame DUI ever. It showed a decently high alcohol amount in my system, but as you all know there's a cross tolerance for benzos so I didn't even feel drunk whatsoever. I was driving completely fine, but it was late at night and a cop asked to roll down my window. I smelled like alcohol. I know, I'm stupid, I shouldn't even be mixing alcohol and benzos but at this taper dose I literally don't even feel the Flubro. It just brings me to baseline.

Any tips?

They have no idea I have other drugs in my system... The only thing they did is check me for alcohol, that's it. No blood tests, nothing.",2

Is it a bad idea to take phenibut during the day to keep the withdrawals manageable? The worse withdrawals start at 1pm -4pm and i take my phenibut 12pm.

I am dependent on phenibut for 8 months now and the Clonazepam only 3months so i feel it's more difficult to stop the clonazepam.

Should i stop phenibut first or can taper the clonazepam first. Phenibut withdrawals i don't feel at all but the clonazepam i do every day and it's terrible, horrific and scares me to death.

I think being using phenibut is causing the withdrawals to be harder and going to be tougher to get off Clonazepam because of phenibut.

Cold-Turkey.,"I was the one who posted an entry 2 months ago (check my profile) about tapering down Alprazolam 0.5 mg given by my psych. Basically I wasn't able to anticipate that I have been going withdrawal since my taper affected my sleep and got insomnia.

Saw a sleep doctor and thought I might have sleep apnea, doctor goes to check my anatomy and found out I have low risk. They prescribed me Clonazepam 2 mg to be taken 2x a day at 1/2 tabs. My medication ran for a month and again and I just finished taking it last week without any taper or advise from my doctor. My last dose was a half tablet of 2 mg Clonazepam, taken before sleep.

Now's my Day 6 of being off of anything. Day 3 hit me real hard. I thought I was gonna die since I felt so sick and I started having recurring nightmares again. After that day, I wasn't able to get a full-blown sleep. That's when the time I got familiarized with the feeling:

I am suffering from withdrawals again.

I've developed this weird sensation where I feel like I'm constantly moving even though I'm lying down or staying still, random body parts (especially arms) are twitching too. Must be vertigo, or so I thought. My eyes went back in being too sensitive to light, and my left ear started to feel like it's full and rang at random times.

Currently having episodes where anxiety and depression is on the roof, and sleep got worse. I only have painkillers and multivitamins to help me get through headaches, but aside from this, I have no supplements to help me combat the symptoms.

QUESTION:
 • Would it be advisable to contact my sleep doctor and administer a taper sched for this benzo? All in all, my benzo consumption would amount for three months in total. I am aware that tapering would be quite similar as hell but I have no idea as to when I can run this taper program with my doctor due to financial issues.

Hope we all get through this. Kinda disappointed that I ended up taking a benzo again in hopes that this would help me taper and complety jump off.

I quitted cold turkey since May and I am very grateful. Can't wait to start again on the right foot.,"I had lots of anxiety and depression issues, tons of bad stuff I've had at the age of 16-17, so I eventually looked for a psychiatrist and I was given benzos and antidepressants. Oh boy, I managed to quit antidepressants cold turkey for 1 horrendous month after half a year of use, but my true enemy were benzo withdrawals.

Back then I had this mentality of ""everything is good in moderation"", so taking benzos and quitting once every two weeks to reduce tolerance is no biggies, right? Right...? Bulls**t, I lost all the confidence in myself to live any stressful situation and I thought I was going insane every next day.

I would go to class, sometimes skipping whole weeks due to my crippling anxiety and returning. Two months before the final months I was sent to a psych ward and lost all will to progress in life, everyone would encourage my lack of motivation with ""health goes first and take your time to recover so you can study again"". But it never stopped. A shitty relationship didn't make it any better.

Well, the next two years were painful as hell, pills didn't help, they were there to cope with the suffering and evade my unbearable situation and I started to believe I had irreversible brain damage, unwanted, unrelatable. It was a period where all my confidence totally shattered.

I have been prescribed up to 8 different benzos, most noticeably 50-75mg of clorazepate dipotassium and 45 of ketazolam, sporadically I would take up to 25mg of diazepam , xanax up to 1.5-2mg. 

I was found a mild irritation in an EEG after not taking my pills for one month because I was asked not to take any treatment previously. After a week I was prescribed pregabaline and I refused to take any at home after reading experiences from people, it would just make everything worse. I also reduced my ketazolam dose to 15mg, I took them for 4 days and it only gave me anxiety and insomnia, so I didn't find any reason to keep taking them.

I then realized I was battling withdrawals all these years thanks to reddit, benzo forums and YouTube experiences, and I am proudly 4 months clean cold turkey. I sacrificed all this summer for a better future and I gladly look back to see it has all ended. I am functioning and feeling way sharper, still readapting to normal life but it's a matter of time.

Never give up guys, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Much love and thanks for sharing your experiences to help others. I am doing the same for all the others.",32

I posted last week freaking the hell out about my situation. For years, I have been taking ~1.5mg Xanax split up in 2-4 doses throughout the day, just to feel “normal”. I’m currently at around 1-1.125/1.25mg(on a bad day). I get that it’s low, but I’ve been extremely depressed and realized that this is no way to live, reliant on something I shouldn’t be taking long term just to feel “normal”. I feel like an old used car that needs to be jumped several times a day just to get down the block.

You were all so helpful and I took most of the advice…one of them bring to try my best to stop ruminating. Hardest thing to do, but I got constructive with my rumination and decided on a plan. I am asking for your help.

I see my psychiatrist next week. I am thinking of bringing up switching from Xanax to either Valium or Librium. I don’t think he really understands how hard it has been for me to taper. He recommended dropping .25 every week or two, but this is extremely painful for me because of how sensitive my body is. .25 has been keeping me normal for hours for the past two years. .5 knocks me out.

Does anyone have similar experience switching to Valium / Librium? I’m anticipating my doctor not knowing the dose equivalency as he’s been extremely nonchalant about the whole thing. Also, I think it would be best to just be prepared in case and bring it up to him.

My schedule currently looks like:
.25mg 8-9am
.25mg 1pm-4pm
.125 or .25mg 6-7pm
.5mg 10-whenever bedtime is.

I know it seems like I’m obsessing…because I am…and because it’s extremely important to me to get off of this and start living my life and learning more helpful ways to cope, with little withdrawal symptoms (hopefully). What would equivalent doses be, and at what times? I just want to make sure I’m doing this right and not getting hooked on even more.

Any advice is helpful, thank you!",1

I know I need to taper off but most doctors I've come across just want to cut pills in half for a few months. Maybe this strategy works for people who have only been on for a short time but I know this would not work for me. 

I finally found a doctor who knows about the Ashton Method and the importance of slow tapers for long-term users. His initial recommendation is a cross-over to Librium and a slow taper from there. I never even heard of Librium until I met this guy.

I asked about crossing-over to diazepam and he's fine with that but said the reason he prefers Librium is that diazepam has a quicker peak. I think I might have read about this where some people refer to the initial cross-over as having a coverage gap. I think he might have mentioned Librium crosses the blood-brain barrier easier as well. 

I also read in the Ashton Manual that some people have trouble crossing from clonazepam to diazepam. So he's giving me the option to taper directly using a compounded solution or ODT tablets. 

I feel overwhelmed with options. My gut says trust Dr. Ashton and cross-over to diazepam but she even said it can be difficult for clonazepam. I don't want to overlook this doctor's knowledge in pharmacology, so maybe he has a point about Librium. But maybe I could prevent a horrible cross-over if I just tapered using a compounded solution?

Which option would give me the best chance for success? Thanks.",2

I realized this dose is too high for me and tried to quit cold turkey, which only resulted in massive rebound anxiety, diarrhea and some kind of seizure. 

Side note: I didn't get a script and got my alprazolam illegally. I know this is dumb, but I've been struggling with anxiety for the past 4 years and tried pretty much every medication under the moon. Psychiatrists and doctors have given me promethazine, antidepressants and neuroleptics etc etc but nothing has worked for me. I heard that alprazolam gives great anxiety relief and I was so desperate that I thought I'd give it a shot. And truly, this drug has helped me immensely. But since I have a kid I knew that I couldn't just keep taking alprazolam from the streets daily. 

I've been able to taper down to 1 mg daily on my own, and it worked pretty good so far. Then I tried to go down to 0.5 mg a day this week and it was a nightmare. Bad withdrawals came crawling back. I figured that this is too much to handle on my own since my alprazolam plug ran out of it and has not been able to get a new stash in 3 weeks (I live in a country where benzodiazepines are extremely hard to get).

All that I have left is 3mg and I know this is not nearly enough to taper correctly. So I went to see my doctor today and told him about everything. He was very understanding and kind but wouldn't let me give a script for tapering because I'm ""so young"" (I'm 25F). So he sent me over to the mental hospital/rehab clinic. I went there immediately, told the same story again, and was told by the psychiatrist that all they could do to help me is keep me in the hospital to withdraw there. But that is absolutely not an option for me because I have a kid.

He understood but said that he was not allowed to give me a script to taper on my own since I didn't have a script to begin with and got alprazolam illegally. So I was sent home with nothing.

I'm terrified right now and don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!",5

I was not a habitual benzo user. I had done them plenty of times in the past but usually very sporadically. In mid July i had a two week period or so of bingeing them. 15 10mg diazepam and 20 2.5 mg xanax.

A few days after the last xanax I had a massive anxiety attack. Felt awful for a few more days. Huge Morning anxiety that would continue i noon afternoon and only fade at night before bed, insomnia, tremors all over, dry wretching or being sick on mornings, no appetite until night, fitful sleep then waking up abruptly very early.

Then it goes, sometimes for a week. I still feel most of these symptoms those days but not as intensely.

Just after my anxiety attack I began ssri citalopram at 10mg, a low dose, and I have been blaming that.

It has been making me suicidal and my doctor dismissed benzo withdrawals even as early as four or five days after my last dose, after my anxiety attack, saying withdrawal as a rule is an ovverated term.

And so I ask you guys who have more specific knowledge and experience here, could this be benzo withdrawal?",1

I'm medically aware that I need psychiatric help for anxiety problems - I take Lyrica and Latuda - but nothing works quite well like the benzos. They solve the issue immediately and very effectively. However, caring for my brain, as I do not wish to have dementia and for my GABA receptors in my brain to still work, I'm hope to stop my benzo habit.

I was looking into Phenibut, a legal substance which seem pretty effective. Can someone share their experiences with it and if they're helpful with quitting benzos?

Overall, feel pretty stupid because I did this to myself and now I want to quit. What's the best course of action for this rapid tolerance ascent situation? Is it a slow taper? Or a rapid jump?

I take a 3mg bar (don't ask) first thing when I wake up before work, and usually split up the second 3mg bar throughout the early-ish afternoon. 

A slow Ashton taper seems stupid at this point, considering it's only been a month (5+ weeks) and adding 3+ months of a slow taper seems like a silly way to just fuel the fire. But I'm terrified of debilitating withdrawal symptoms (esp a seizure) that would affect my work.

Hey guys. I know I am not in a lot, if not most, of y’all’s shoes, however, I just went thru some shitty withdrawals from klonopin. 

I ran out of my script early, thinking that because I was only on it for 1 month and 3 weeks at .5/mg 3x daily, it wouldn’t matter too much. Ohhhhhhhh boy was I wrong. 

1. I should have researched bonzos thoroughly before taking them. And my psychiatrist should have educated me on them as well. I wasn’t told “This should be a short term thing to get you thru these very very tough times.” I wasn’t told “If you’re on it for more than a couple weeks then we will need to taper you off”, nothing. I should have done my part and researched it as well. I think I may get new psychiatrist now. 

2. I have taken benzos in the past, both unsubscribed and subscribed, but that was 8-10 years ago. I had no issues coming off of them suddenly then. So I wasn’t expecting this. I am older and I am bipolar but I was bipolar then too. 

3. Benzos are a slippery slope that escalates faster than you can blink. I am tapering off them starting with my next refill. I have read enough of y’all’s horror stories and done enough independent research. I REFUSE to be stuck on these for years. No way. I was on hydroxyzine before these and because my life circumstances had changed so much, I needed something stronger to get me thru it. I should have stopped after the first 2-3 weeks. 

4. I have learned that I need to build proper coping mechanisms and live a much healthier lifestyle to control my panic and anxiety. Not turn to a quit fix like benzos. I know they help out a lot of people tremendously, and they did help me thru my rough time, but I cannot go thru anything like this again, and def not what a lot of you all are going thru. My heart goes out to each and every one of you that are long term users. 

Even tho I haven’t been with this community for more than a few days, y’all’s stories, testimonies, and those that answered my post have helped me tremendously and really opened my eyes. For that, I thank you.",15

TODAY IS 14 DAYS!  I'm really feeling good about my decision to stop taking Xanax.  Feel pretty back to normal now. 

*edited to add more detail now that I am able to sit down and write freely

I know a lot of yall have made it way farther than me, but I just have to share because I am proud of myself.

I was content taking my Xanax to be honest.  Made me feel numb while going through a very unhealthy separation.  That was over, and the Xanax was keeping me content.  I decided to do some shrooms one night.  I had gotten some liquid psilocybin (turned out to be 4-aco-dmt, found out after the fact).  It was great but I could feel myself wanting to take my Xanax as I hadn't taken it that day.  That's when shit got wierd.  It's like the  shrooms made me able to see that this was a problem and I needed to get rid of this problem.  Then my Fishtank started changing shapes and I kinda forgot about the xan thing.  Next morning I wake up and the first thing I could think of was how I needed to stop taking them.  It's been on my mind ever since that experience.

I was taking .5- 1mg Xanax per day for about the last 4 years.  Some days I would take a quarter bar, some days a half.  But never more than a half bar in a day.

I will add I have always been extremly afraid to quit because I've read so many horror stories.  So, I wanted to share how this experience was for me.

I tapered down a consistent .5mg per day for about 2 weeks.  Then down to .25mg for another two weeks.Then jumped off from there.  Today is day 10 and I feel pretty good!  I decided I needed to get out of my normal surroundings to be successful with this.  I took a 5 day vacation and went camping in Bodega Bay with a few friends.  The night before we left, I took my last .25mg. 

Day 1-  not too bad, felt a bit of a headache
Day 2- my whole body hurt! I wasn't sure if it was because of the lack of meds, or because I slept on a shitty air mattress.
Day 3- body hurts more.  Mind all over the place.
Day 4- slightly better
Day 5- anxiety like a MF! Holy cow.

Day 6 I headed home from camping. Feeling Allright, kinda suprised I made it that far.  But felt determined to keep on because I have never made it 5 days without a dose.

Over the course of those 5 days camping I smoked 56 prerolled joints, and they reallllllly seemed to help me calm down.  I also drank 4 out of those 5 days, not overdoing it maybe like 3 shots over 6 hours or so.  Not sure if that made it a little more bearable, but I am not a drinker at all normally, so 3 shots had me feeling like a champ haha

I'm on day 10 and the brain fog has lifted, smells seem more vibrant, even the cool air hitting my shaved head feels different.  Feels like I'm living more in the now as opposed to just existing, if that makes sense.

Anyways, this subreddit is what gave me the motivation to get this over with.  Thank you everyone for posting your stories.  I'm determined to not go back to Xanax.

I hope this story helps someone like all of yours have helped me.

Thank you all.  I will update this as I reach my milestones.  Ten days was the first one.  Next one is 30 days.  See yall in 20 days.

i have definitely improved, theres no debating that. but im still not ""well"" 
all current symptoms are psychological, my physical symptoms wore off extremely quickly. most days i just feel disconnected, dp/dr is still going strong, insomnia, just not like a normal person. 
i had an amazing window the month of april &amp; felt almost entirely healed, then catapulted into my worst wave and have had windows since but nothing like how i felt in april-
tomorrow i start a new job
i am honestly so excited to start it, ive always wanted to work in early childhood and being a preschool teacher is something i have dreamed of for awhile. 
unfortunately that means waking up at 5am m-f which is where my anxiety brews. unsure if anyone else can relate but my sleep schedule currently is so sensitive, if i dont sleep enough i feel 10x worse the following day. im normally awake by 8 but 5 is a HUGE difference lol. im planning on going to sleep around 9/9:30 but even with melatonin sometimes the insomnia keeps me up until about 2am
normally i would be able to function on little sleep and could push through the day but right now its really hard.
i plan on just basically forcing myself to do it & hope itll get easier with time and hope i continue to heal but i am so nervous so honestly if anyone could just hype me up a little that would be so appreciated.",3
2021-09-08 13:25:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/pkf0m7/calling_all_taper_experts/,Calling all taper experts,"years ago I was a heavy abuser of Xanax. I was constantly drunk and eating up to 8-16 mg a day of Xanax. Was just what I did. About a year and a half ago I ordered etizolam. And it’s Just gotten worse. I normally don’t get blacked out, but I do sometimes. And I wake up feeling like such a piece of shit. I cannot live like that. THIS IS JUST MY EXPERIENCE. I am not saying anyone who does drugs has a problem, I just know that when I take them, I never want to stop.

So right now I have etizolam, Xanax, fluAlp, small bottle of pyrazolam, and small bottle of Diclazepam. My question is, what could be the best benzo to take now to not suffer severe withdrawal, and also not be fucked up. Xanax and etizolam are both short half lives. So my options are 

Fluclotizolam
Deschloroetizolam
Pyrazolam
Methyl-clonazepam
Bromazolam
3-hydroxyphenazepam 

I could also potentially get Diclazepam blotters. But out of the above listed benzos, which would be the best for tapering down to nothing?",1

2021-09-08 08:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/pk9gko/the_shakes/,the shakes,"Last night I had my most intense physical symptom after a cut so far. I cut from .3 down to .275 clonazepam on Sunday, and 3 days after a cut I always seem to feel it the most. Last night my legs started shaking sorta, kinda felt like what could be restless leg syndrome. Then shortly after, the shakes spread to my whole body and I was shivering intensely like it was freezing cold, even though it was 78 degrees in my apartment. I couldn’t control it, my teeth were chattering some, I tried to get some water and I spilled it. It finally stopped when I sat down on my bed & hugged my legs in to my chest, not sure if that was a coincidence. I checked the clock and noticed that the shaking had lasted ~7 minutes.

Just wanted to share. It was kinda frightening; I kept thinking “is this WD or something else?” Like I know this symptom can happen from WD but it’s scary when something like that happens; it makes you question. Especially when living alone. Like I don’t have anyone to comfort or reassure me. What do you guys do when symptoms start to get scary? Any tips/ suggestions/ encouragement appreciated ❤️",3

The Valium almost seems like a placebo. It doesn't kill my anxiety or bring back my appetite like every other benzo does, it doesn't help me sleep *at all* like every other benzo, I don't feel relaxed on it like every other benzo, and *every dose* gives me a headache.

I was very anxious and exhausted one day from lack of sleep and tried 30mg at once to see if maybe my dose was just way too low, and it made me fall asleep, but I cant say it was really anxiolytic or ""nice"" feeling like everyone seems to praise it for.

It's (very mild) main effects last for maybe 4 or 5 hours, but it does prevent withdrawals for days (I ran out a few days early last time because of my 30mg experiment and experienced basically no withdrawals). 

I have a doctor's appointment and I'm not sure what to tell them. 

I know this is the right way to get off benzos, but man, I wish Diclazepam (an RC benzo) was prescription, because that stuff is wonderful for tapering; it's basically everything I hoped Valium would be. But I can't afford to keep buying enough for a taper and really want to get away from the ""grey market"" route.",1

I picked up my Valium RX today and took 7.5 mg four hours ago, the dose I was last stable at. I still feel like I’m going through benzo withdrawals. 

I don’t want to decrease the efficacy of Valium by taking an antibiotic and my doctor and pharmacist are clueless.

I was initially put on Ativan and was then switched over to  Klonopin. For the first two months I was taking 0.500mg a day. By month  three I was taking 1mg a day at night before bed. During this time I  also (stupidly) tried getting off twice but reinstated after noticing I  experienced a severe depression whenever I made a cut.

I was in  the psych ward last month and on August 28th they cut my dose from 1mg  to 0.750mg. The psychiatrist said he could stop me cold turkey and I  would be completely fine since I was on such a low dose but I knew  better. Today is day 10 of being on 0.750mg and I am definitely feeling  it.

My question is, since I have ""only"" been using for 104 days,  would a somewhat quick taper of going down 0.250mg every two works work?  I was considering taking 0.750mg for another four days and then going  down to 0.500mg.

Luckily for me I am extremely sensitive to  medications/drugs so I caught the negative side effects relatively early on.  Horrible depression, dissociation and I have been getting very bad  suicidal thoughts for the first time in my entire life. Sometimes I feel  like I am going insane.

I tried asking my psychiatrist to  switch over to Valium and then taper off that but he said there is no  difference. What do you think? I want this poison out of my system  because it is legitimately making me suicidal I believe and severely  depressed. For the span I have been taking is going down 0.250mg every  two weeks too much? Or should I cut down by 0.125mg?

Any advice  please, I am pretty desperate. I had a hard time coming off Gabapentin  back in June so I am terrified of what is store for me facing this  demon. I legitimately feel like I have lost my mind (although I have  also been forced to quit a fear year long amphetamine addiction as well  before this, which is no doubt contributing a lot to my f'ed up mental  state.)",5

Im in stage 2, when you are bsically replacing 0,5 mg of clonazepam for 10mg of valium.

So i am at 2,5mg clonazepam + 20mg of valium.

Here comes my question. Does 10 mg of valium really equals to 0,5 clonazepam? I feel like i have basically started again taking benzos and i feel the ""hangover"" next day.  


This is my second day of 20mg Valium replacing clonazepam and im slow and tired af.

Can anyone relate to this symptoms when tapering with valium?

Started using 7 months ago. I suffer from borderline disorder so in 1-2 months of being prescribed Xanax I was taking 6-8mg per day. Finally decided to stop this summer because I’m in med school and my memory is being a bit affected. 

By some miracle I managed to go from 6mg to 1mg in 4 weeks but as I reduced even further I started getting affected by withdrawals. In frustration and lacking knowledge on how to effectively stop using benzos I went cold turkey for 3 days. If hell exists I was definitely there. I went back to 1mg. After a couple weeks of suffering of Xanax withdrawals I followed and Ashton manual theory and switched to valium. It saved my sanity and I’m now on 0.625 of diazepam per day. 

Thinking of stabilizing at this dose and reducing 2 more times before jumping off. 

I won’t lie, I’m scared shitless of the jump and the effect it will have on my academic life but I must face it anyway so might as well do it now.

Any suggestions, personal stories you nice people care to share?

Will keep it as short as I can. Also excuse the typos I took quite a bit of what I'm trying to taper off of so this post alone will probably take an hour for me to type the two or three paragraphs that is.

Etizolam

Began 6 weeks ago 2--8mg

Maybe topped off over the next two weeks at around 10 mg.

Week 3 - 5.5 (last Thursday)
Big shipment came in of 200 mg in pez candy form, and 300mg solution.

Since then things have gotten a little out of control on day of arrival I probably took 15 ml to mg between the two. It's only stayed close to that or gone up significantly like it did today.

30mg taken already between the two different types and it's only midday here.

I have 140 mg left in Pez candy form and 180 mg left in solution. 

I know where this is going to lead and I don't want to end up there. I have a lot riding on being exposed bye an obvious withdraw (probation + hospital = Jail/death) 

I'd like a long slow taper plan. If I were to try this on my own I know exactly what would happen hence the thread.

I'll even update this thread as it goes along for people in my situation who need the same type of Help thanks you.guys

Also I work a physically demanding job so I can't have a plan that calls for 10 milligrams something like that in the morning during couple weeks where my stash was low I wouldn't even take any until I was off at 3:30 p.m. so if there's a way to back load at all I would appreciate it thanks you guys.",2

No discernible symptoms but could have been conflated with phenibut. Second bottle came in: 10mg. I used for about a week. Four days off. No WD. Continued to used same bottle for 8 days. I used gabapentin for phenibut WD during the middle of the second week with clonazolam. I felt mild WD upon cessation and insomnia kept the clonazolam train going. Doses were mostly around .125-5mg, generally before bed. 

I am expecting healthy rebound or mild-moderate WD. I am expecting anxiety, some physical, and insomnia, which is already present regardless of clonazolam. 

Here is what I have and let me know what would be useful or hurtful. The help is greatly appreciated, as I have never gone through benzodiazepines WD, but phenibut WD was not fun. 

* propanolol 

* ashwagandha 

* NAC 

* my regular BP med lisinopril

* calcium chews with vitamin D

* flintstones complete 

* fish oil

* l-theanine

* chamomile sleepy time 

* lemon balm

* lavender balm

* diphenhydramine 

* doxylamine succinate

* melatonin

* intuniv (adhd medication) 

* magnesium glycinate 

* miralax (if constipated?) 

* 5htp


If I think of anything else, I’ll add it. Most notably, I am interested in whether I can take propanolol. It seemed to be the biggest help during phenibut withdrawal. I also found l-Theanine and ashwagandha beneficial for alleviating anxiety, along with a positive mindset. I don’t know what help NAC would be in this case.",1

Ended up at 1mg before I finally started cutting the first week of January. I had already been experiencing tolerance withdrawal before starting to wean. I remember being horrified at the thought of taking 8 months to completely wean off of it, and was in denial about how crappy the withdrawals could be. They were rough and super bizarre. I remember my fingers vibrating for weeks. As time went on, I got used to things and they did start to lighten up. The tinnitus has gotten so much better than what it was. I remember it being so bad I couldn't hear anything else and the pain could bring me to my knees. Now it usually only comes at night, but it hardly even bothers me anymore. 

I stopped all Xanax last Tuesday and then tested positive for Covid on Friday. I honestly couldn't tell what were withdrawals and what might have been Covid. All in all, the withdrawals haven't been too bad. Last Thursday was probably the worst of it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to FINALLY be off that garbage. I look back and can't believe the uphill battle that I conquered. I'm proud of myself and no matter if you are at the beginning of the journey, the middle or at the end, be proud of yourself too. This shit is hard and you're doing it!

Is there hope for me?,"*EDIT* - I am overwhelmed by the support and kind words/encouragement from you ALL. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU. I am going to only come back on to read THESE comments and not obsess over the other posts or anything else on Google. 

Hi,

I understand I recently posted about this, but I am realizing more and more the potential severity of my situation and really would appreciate feedback, where to go from here with my doctor, etc.

For years, I’ve been prescribed Alprazolam (.5mg x 3 times a day as needed). I’m a highly sensitive, emotional 29 y/o F who has been struggling with anxiety and panic with some depression her whole life. The main character in my rumination life has been obsessing over my Xanax usage and how to stop.

I never took more than 1.5mg a day. I know I’ve needed it daily in less of that amount probably since around 2017. I break them up in .25 doses, so .25 morning, .25 afternoon, .25 late afternoon, .5 before bed (sometimes skipping the late afternoon one). 

I now know I can’t live this way forever and it may be the hardest thing to do to come off. I come from a family of nurses who reassure me that “some people just need this”, and that if I were to just stop cold turkey I would be fine, too. My doctor said something similar, to just wean off by cutting out the .25 as I need to over some weeks. But then I found this group and realize that some people have an even harder time coming off less in a less amount of time. 

I guess I’m just looking for ANY reassurance or guidance, or next steps. What would a safe taper be? I’m obviously having rebound anxiety if I need to pop them every 5-8 hours. Should I approach my doctor about a Valium taper? How would that work as far as my schedule and equivalency?

I feel like I haven’t been living my life. It’s just been thinking about how I feel constantly and watching the clock. I feel like so much has been wasted and I’m not being taken seriously. I see a therapist through BetterHelp chat, not too sure if that’s been helping. Requested an in person meeting for EMDR or at the very least, CBT as I think this would be more effective in person.

I guess any advice, where to go next, reassurance would be appreciated. This is ruining my life and I wasted my 20s just worrying. I would like to go back to school and pursue other interests, but I feel so held back. I cry thinking about how everyone else just has a normal brain and doesn’t think twice about this shit.

Thank you ♥️",29

I did feel better but I had depression I think and felt sorry for myself so I started dosing higher since then about 2 weeks almost now.

Now they gave me deseprimine which I don't want I'd rather just use the tradazone that helps sleep and depression but I don't really wanna argue with doctors so I just sat okay cool and pick it up but don't take them. They did give me 25mg 10x libruim which I didn't use yet because it's so confusing they say take it when need it but it's unclear if illl be able to obtain a refill. So I'm trying to figure out should I take them all at once since it's long lasting or space it out I want to have to need for benzos I was thinking like ambien after the libruim just to not shock my system too much. They also mjs diagnosed me I believe I don't have adhd I'm never overactive unless under stress. Im more ADD shy disorganized lack of motivation there's a difference.

Been off of ativan for a month after almost 3 months of daily use (0.5 mg, twice daily). Had a pretty rough go with my CT, body tingles, pressure headaches, stomach issues, anxiety, blurry vision, light sensitivity, muscle spasms, etc. 

Almost all of it is behind me after a month of stopping, but now I am here, dealing with the anxiety that drove me to the medication in the first place, including panicking while driving. Good times. I'm in therapy, and have been since late April, but most of that time was while I was on meds. 

Can I take things like magnesium to help me or will it hurt me? I feel like it helps, but then it's almost like a little hang over the next day when it wears off. I'm not taking it daily, but want to. The dose is 200 mg. It's oxidate, I hear citrate is more effective.  

How much time does my brain need to heal? Will supplements harm things since the withdrawl seems to be behind me.

 Is drinking out of the question after stopping short term use? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Also, thank you for all of your prior help. I realize that my short term use is a drop in the bucket compared to those that have been recovering from long term use.

Edit: 

I have tried a few SSRIs and they don't work well for me. I get physical adverse reactions like itching and rashes. It also wrecks my stomach and makes me more anxious. I was put on Ativan as an alternative and responded well, but had concerns over long term use. It was also making me so sedated.

I am 36(m) I have been on 2mg clonazepam for 10 years, been tapering for 2 years, was on .125mg for a month before jumping off. I decided that I already have felt like ass for the last 10 months in the taper so jumping off couldn’t be much worse. 

The first 3 days were honestly not terrible, the following 7 nights have been progressively harder. I have little body tremors at night that can’t be seen but I can definitely feel a vibrating sensation when I sit still or close my eyes. Focusing on anything is difficult, I am continuously dizzy, and today especially I am extremely fatigued.

I have read conflicting reports on a possible timeframe I may be looking at. I really am just hoping to have a clearer picture of potential milestone dates I can look forward to during moments I am really struggling to keep from dosing. Is the worst of withdrawal yet to come? How long will it be unbearable?

Also does anybody have any advice on supplements, foods, mushrooms, techniques for optimal performance during withdrawal periods? Specifically to help me manage my work load.

*Just as a side note any time I try gabapentin, pregabalin, phenibut, kava. They all intensify the tremor feeling. Even 5htp seemed to increase the discomfort. 

(Idk if anyone else has these mini tremors or if they are associated w benzo withdrawal. They actually don’t look like anything, it is just an internal vibration, like I feel like a train is going by or there are tiny earthquakes that only I can feel. Except they don’t really stop. They are just more or less intense at times.)

Any support, advice, wisdom is GREATLY appreciated 🙏🙏🙏",6
