I was prescribed 12mg of alprazolam, 12mg clonazepam, 250mg seroquel and various antidepressants for 4 years. I dropped down to 50mg seroquel and stopped the antidepressant without tapering or talking to my doctor, that was fine nothing happened. Then I decided to ask him for help coming off the benzos and he told me he can't help me as the doses were too high and it's not his specialty and told me to go to a rehab facility. So I tried that and they rejected me because ""the doctor prescribing it is supposed to be the one to do it, and they would've helped me if I was getting them off the street"" that really pissed me off as the only other solution would be an expensive private rehab facility. So I decided to taper on my own. Within one month I was down by half to 6mg clonazepam and 6mg alprazolam, then 0mg alprazolam 12mg clonazepam and around 3 weeks after that I reached 2mg clonazepam and more alprazolam. But now I kinda feel stuck, I still don't feel normal, I still have anxiety. I feel fine when I take 2mg clonazepam but I don't wanna stay on benzos for any longer. Also from what I've been reading on this subreddit a lot of people consider 2mg to be a really high dose and in most posts they recommend slow taper that would last months and switching to diazepam which my psychiatrist won't do. So that's why I'm so lost and confused why wasn't my rapid taper from much higher doses not so bad like people make it seem to be? Why do I need to taper so slowly from 2mg clonazepam? Why was it easier for me to go down from these ridiculous doses yet I can't get off 2mg? And is 2mg of clonazepam really considered a high dose?

Also I am not trying to say that coming off what seems to me as a low dose relatively speaking is easy or not a big deal. On the contrary I love this sub and I genuinely feel happy when someone gets off any dose of any benzo and love the wholesome support this community offers.",15,{}

6,2019-12-29 15:43:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ehb7rr/off_benzos_after_22_years/,Off Benzos after 22 years,"Hello! 

I thought I‚Äôd share my story. I was prescribed 10mgs of Valium a day for a little over 20 years. Some nights I didn‚Äôt take it but then in the past 4 years my use escalated to taking it every night and sometimes taking 20mgs right before bed for sleep. Other times taking it for an afternoon nap as an escape from the stress I was under at the time. 

I have other issues too. Was a heroin addict in my teens and later drank way way too much alcohol (have stopped now). 

Anyway! I went on vacation and forgot to take my Valium, had no idea how dangerous that was and after 5 days I had terrible awful withdrawals: paranoia, then hallucinations then awful psychosis and losing all touch with reality. It was like being awake in a hideous, scary nightmare. 

The doctor sedated me via an injection with a strong anti psychotic (EDIT: called Halperdol, plus a very mild benzo) and I slept for a good day or so and then I improved and was back to normal but very shellshocked. I stayed on the anti psychotic meds for a few weeks once I got home and then decided I was never ever going back to Valium. 

As crazy and ignorant as this sounds, it took a good month for me to figure out this was all the Valium. I genuinely thought I had randomly gone mad, because I had stopped taking Valium for a few days or more lots of times in the past and been fine. 

The first few months I was quite  depressed. I ate a lot and had no energy to exercise. I was able to work though and that served as a welcome distraction. I had lots of trauma surrounding going through through DTs and kept remembering it with crushing anxiety and shame, my cheeks would flush red and I would feel horrible shame and also panicky. (Withdrawal symptoms although again I thought maybe I was just super embarrassed rather than putting it down to withdrawal). 

I finally saw a therapist who said these were intrusive memories and would abate in time and they have, I have days when I feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. üòÖ

I used meditation (I love the app Headspace), healthy eating and exercise plus talk therapy. 

Once I did that I was able to sleep as well as I once did on Valium, which shocked me, but once I discovered meditation, sleep wasn‚Äôt an issue. The first week it was hard but after that I slept. 

Now it‚Äôs 10 months later. I still get intrusive memories of the DTs but meditation has helped me to learn to banish those memories when they interrupt. It was a very traumatic and terrifying incident so I suspect it‚Äôs partly residual trauma compounded by withdrawal. 

I sleep ok, am finally losing weight and have only (I say ‚Äúonly‚Äù!) mild anxiety now. I do worry about silly things, and jump out of my skin and am startled easily at sudden noises. But I‚Äôm definitely through the worst. I know I‚Äôm better because I have the motivation/ energy/ ability to workout now.  

My pieces of advice would be: If you are prescribed or take benzos, never ever go cold turkey or let yourself run out. And if you‚Äôre considering tapering then do so with medical supervision. 

As horrible and scary as this has been, I‚Äôm thankful this all happened now or I would have just kept taking Valium for life. I‚Äôm finally free of Valium and will never ever take it again. (My doc won‚Äôt prescribe it now anyway). 

What‚Äôs weird is, because I had been addicted to heroin in my younger years, I saw Valium as benign and had no idea withdrawal symptoms were even possible. BUT maybe that‚Äôs helped in recent months because there‚Äôs been slightly less of a psychosomatic aspect of withdrawal. 

I‚Äôm able to cope with the symptoms knowing they‚Äôre that - symptoms and I‚Äôm paying the piper rather than randomly going insane. I guess this process is the reverse - I‚Äôm going sane! ;-) 

Sending love, peace and support to you all for now and 2020 and beyond. 

Thanks for letting me share! X",47,{}

I'm 20 days off. Jumped at 0.5 mg of valium. 

I've noticed I am extremely aware of what my heart is doing... I can feel it beating, I can feel when it slows down or speeds up. Actually thought I was experiencing heart problems but had an EKG that showed normal sinus rhythm etc. Still can't stop checking my heart rate via pulse oximeter. It has a plethysmograph and I'm forever monitoring the waveform. 

I had flu like symptoms last week.. nausea, sweating, headache. The headaches are still there sometimes. Felt a lot of pressure in my head. 

A lot of the withdrawal symptoms have diminished and many times I feel a sense of normalcy. The symptoms seem to be triggered by stress as they happen 90% of the time when I'm working. 

My anxiety has been through the roof but I expect it to be.

Explained him length (just over a year and dosages which i recently increased with no real effect - thus benzos stopped working and just keeps me from bad wd's).

He suggested quite fast and rapid taper with help of anti-seizures sort of depakine or carbamazepine, ssri, lyrica and something else. I told him - i am against a rx cocktails after disaster experience with lyrica.

He said ok  lets leave lyrica on side, other medicines are safe and they wont affect your memory and cognitives further. But after research plenty ppl reported memory issues with lamo, depakine or other anti-seizures shoot the memory off. 

And i dont want any ssri/snri's since they have their own possible wd's and sides.

My biggest problem so far is crippling depression some days, no motivation and no joy. Short spell in low doses and it turned it back at me.

I‚Äôve been prescribed 3mg of Xanax per day for about two years, as well as 2mg of Klonopin. When I started Xanax I was nearly bedridden with anxiety, lost my job for missing too many days of work due to my anxiety, and skipped a trip to Europe that I paid for all because I couldn‚Äôt fathom leaving my apartment. 

My normal psychiatrist is very opposed to prescribing Xanax because of how addicting it is, so I went to a ‚Äúquack doctor‚Äù to get a prescription for that. I told my psychiatrist about it and he told me he couldn‚Äôt stop me from taking it but advised me not to. I also took Lexapro at first and now Latuda for depression and for awhile this worked for me. 

Over the past six months, I‚Äôve developed a strong desire to wean myself off Xanax. I felt like a drug addict taking it and often times found myself taking it out of habit rather than for anxiety attacks. I told my therapist about this, and he told me to try taking 2mg instead of 3mg and eventually 1mg as needed. 

It‚Äôs been over two weeks since I last took Xanax.  I never refilled my last prescription and was able to attend my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs wedding a plane ride away (something that would have typically given me severe anxiety) without any benzodiazepines whatsoever. Now I‚Äôve been taking Klonopin as needed and my antidepressant everyday. Eventually I‚Äôd like to go off Klonopin as well but at the moment I‚Äôm taking it one step at a time as I don‚Äôt want to relapse into using Xanax again.",6,{}

The majority of the literature seems to recommend tapering down from benzo use with diazepam due to it's long half-life and the availability of small dosage pills.

However, I've seen it mentioned numerous times that diazepam's muscle relaxant properties greatly increase the risk of protracted withdrawal. Is this true and if so, why?

Conversely, i've read that Klonopin has the greatest potential for protracted withdrawal due to it's potency and long duration of action.

I've been taking this stuff for a long time, crucial growing stages of my brain and life, hindered, all by this pill.

Backstory: Mother is on it, thinks pills solve the problem. Be me, 14, acting out as a teenager does. My mom starts feeding me xanax to ""chill me out."" Continues to feed them to me throughout the course of  4 years. At that point, I am knocking on 19 wanting to move out, no insurance, addicted to zans. I turn to the streets and I am able to find them easily. So easily I was able to get enough to slang, pay my car off, and enough to me and my friends to get high every night. So I made it worse for myself. I continued to take them until a friend of mine and me came up with a plan to get Obamacare, and have me see a doctor to get a full on script. It worked, I felt like Charlie in Willy Wonka with the golden ticket. Again, I made it worse for myself. Much worse. I had a script now. 120 @ 4x a day. This has been going on since 2014. The winter of 2018 I met a guy who I thought changed my world (wrong) but I made an effort to stop taking them, but my mistake was cold turkey. I got three days before I caved. I was mad, I was sad, I would cry, I would laugh hysterically, I would get migraines, all within this 3 day withdrawl period. I took one, still here.

Flash forward to now: I have managed to get some kind of grip and I take 2ish a day. I feel like I'll never get off the shit and part of me has come to terms that this little pills controls my life. I asked for it, literally. I feel so dumb, but here I am, having such a hard time with this shit. I resent my mother for giving me, a child at the time, such a substance.

Withdrawl is a bitch and it's for real. Any guidance and advice is appreciated. I have considered rehab, but money and I live in a remote area. Not excuses, but the truth. Love you guys <3",17,{}

Has any of you successfully tapered off of benzos and remained functional, carried on working and doing daily tasks?  As much as i want i would avoid the psych and more meds that 'will assist with taper' but have they own sides.

Eight months into my taper (2mg/d Clonazepam > 30mg Diazepam > to 5-10mg Diazepam now) I come to report that things aren't going so well. It is almost impossible to cope with the constant pressure, and when a day or week goes well, the next one usually is doomed to be unbearable. Every small set back at work sends me into panic, which justifies me taking 10mg instead of 5mg. And if I am not relapsing on Diazepam I end up pulling open a bottle of wine. It's too easy, and I guess I can't get around the alcohol in this house when I feel like absolute shit. 

Needless to say, since I haven't disclosed my issues with my employer he is getting tired of it all. Tomorrow I'll be send to outside medical HR mediation to address my behavioral 'issues' at work, I very much doubt that anyone suspects that I have drug dependency/addiction issues. But in terms for my career it may be my savior as on my current union contract I cannot be fired without compensation during sickness in the first 24 months....I have a small chance of being able to start over after my taper. But of course, my employer...understandable may be of different opinion since he will be one stuck with the bill to aid my recovery.

Just looking for advice or to see if anyone has any experience with this in Canada or Ontario specifically. 
My doctor switched me from clonazepam to diazepam to then taper off slowly. 
I attempted a 0.5 taper and was thrown right back into withdrawals : flu like symptoms, general horrible feeling, etc. I went back to the doctor a few days later and we reinstated the original 10 mg diazepam dose for me to stabilize and increased the antidepressant viibryd. 
I saw him today after 2 weeks. He wants another 2-3 weeks of me feeling better before I do another cut to the medication which I‚Äôm okay with. I guess he thinks that with my mood better I will be able to tolerate withdrawal better... which yeah I get it...but it is still hell. So I suggested a liquid taper as I feel micro tapering may be the best for me since I was so sensitive to the small taper in diazepam. 

Unfortunately the liquid formulation is not available in Ontario or not in production and I just wanted to know what my options are.  Would a compound pharmacy be able to create smaller doses then 0.5 mg of diazepam? Can I get a liquid somehow? Does anyone else have experience with this?

1- is good due to long half-life and easy to taper (mostly)
2 - its not good because due to long half-life it builds up to the point, where below 10mg cuts are very small and even after 2 weeks wd's may hit you hard (quite often recently)
3 - petfect, even with quite aggressive taper its forgiving and you can land softly and smoothly (quite rare).

Read that xanax and kpin causing cognitive impairment  and memory issues pretty fast whilst valium or ativan is quite forgiving and doesnt fry your brain as fast as others. Is that true?

And lastly - with valiums long half-life, how long to keep between the cuts? 7-10 days for a moderate taper after 1 year use? Currently 1-1.5mg kpin and 15mg valium crossing over (hit tolerance wd's after lyrica dependency and had no choice but updose). Want start cutting from next week , replacing each 0.5mg kpin with 10mg valium.

So 1.5mg kpin and 15mg valium - cut 5 mg hold few days.
Then 1mg kpin and 20 mg valium -cut 4, 3, 2, 1 until 10mg
Then 0.5mg kpin and 20 mg valium again - same cuts
Then just 20mg valium cuts like 4,.3.5,3,2.5 etc until.1mg or even 0.5mg.

Does that sound realistic and is it a good idea to switch over to valium for taper? Need remain functional and do it slowly.

  I've spent the last 2 months tapering off Valium, from 30mg - 2.5mg a night. Last night I took my last 2.5mg dose and tonight will be my first night without a dose. It's been a challenge, maybe the most difficult thing I have been through in my life. I can't wait to be free from the constraints of this addiction but I can't help but to be scared about what is to come. I was basically left to my own devices to manage my taper by my self and I guess all I'm looking for is reassurance that everything will be okay. I can't help but to feel an overwhelming sense of despair!

Is 2.5mg low enough to jump off? That's as small as I can cut my pills, so I don't really have much of a choice.",5,{}

I started seeing a new psychiatrist who put me on gabapentin messed with my antidepressants and added klonopin. At first it was calming and sedating. After a few weeks I started to notice depression. She kept increasing my dose of klonopin and was up to 4mg per day. I went to a treatment center and they placed me on a different antidepressant. I came off the gabapentin as I thought it was contributing to my severe debilitating depression. But I‚Äôm still severely depressed. I am beginning to taper off of the klonopin and I got down to 3 mg.  Has anyone experienced severe depression while taking klonopin or any other benzodiazepine?  I am hoping to go down a quarter of a milligram this weekend. These drugs a messing with my brain very badly!!",2,{}

I posted on here a few weeks ago, and I just want to post again. I know it probably seems like I need a lot of reassurance... because I do. This sh\*t is scary as f\*\*k 

So two weeks ago I had gone down from 2mg diazepam daily to 1mg. Last week, I went down to 0.5mg diazepam daily. Today is the date I am supposed to jump off. 

I started on 15mg of diazepam in July after being on 0.5mg klonopin for about 3 weeks. I have slowly tapered down from 15mg to 0.5mg very gradually. 

Given that I have been on 0.5mg for a week, is it likely that I'll experience a seizure after I jump? My withdrawal symptoms have begun to fade, by the way. I was actually able to go to the mall today (and the gym) with minimal derealization. 

Please tell me if you think I'm going to have a seizure at this point.

All the best,

I was prescribed Diazepam because of immense mental stress over the last few months. I am now experiencing massive dissociation/derealization following cessation. The Dissociation came on suddenly following a stressful event in the day and hasn't gone.

In total I took 100mg over a 25 day period, about 5mg a day. I was also taking Zopiclone for 15 days (3.75mg a day)

From the 21/11 to the 3/12 I took only 20mg, the last few doses were 2.5mg a day and then two sets of 1.25mg (snapped tablet). The taper was a bit abrupt and a few days before I had a 5mg, so it wasn't a great taper.

Last Tuesday I had my last dose (I still have a couple more tablets, but wanted to stop). I had felt fine (in this regard, no withdrawal) until Friday where something stressed me out and I felt absolutely zombified and dissociated while in the shops, nothing felt real and I couldn't concentrate. It came on very suddenly I was fine on the walk there. The feeling hasn't gone away and I can barely read and type this without stress and effort. I am having massive concentration issues and am scared about this. I have NO physical symptoms at all.

I took a zoiclone last nmight to see if that helped and it didn't, since I feel the same today.

My question is this./ It is advisable to re-taper the Diazepam or since I'm already 6 days into not taking it just leave it. I don't want this feeling to persist I haven't been able to do anything much the last few days.

I don't think 100mg was that much right, so my withdrawal should be minimal, but I don't know if it's right to re-taper. I have ZERO physical symptoms right now.",9,{}

I have cut out drinking completely in the past month or so. Been trying to do it without doctors, but realized I do not have enough diclazepam to complete a slow taper. I'm down to my last 100mg, I still have a lot of clonazolam but thats what really ramped up my tolerance so havent been touching it at all for about two months.

Currently at 10mg diclaz a day, been up to ~18 on my worst days before starting to taper and have been using etiz, diclaz and clonazolam in oscillating quantities for about 7 months. So I decided to reach out to a few recovery places (I will also be reaching out to a psychiatrist). I had a visit at one today to get particulars. They told me they would give gabapentin to prevent seizure, but would taper the benzos very aggressively. Like a reduction of 10-20mg of valium per day, probably starting at 90mg a day. That scared me, they said they prevent seizure or anything like that in detox but in about two weeks or less would expect me to be 100% off benzodiazepines. This seems against everything I've read about getting off these drugs and having a safe recovery.

For a place that keeps saying individualized care it seems pretty cookie cutter and rigid. There are a lot of rules too, and I understand that. I just want to safely taper and be okay. Has anyone been through a clinic like this? Are there any tips of what to ask about? I feel pretty lost and terrified honestly. Im worried I will have to pick the best of bad options. I'm still looking at options, but this place is rated as one of the best in the area.

I used to have a gabapentin rx, I might be able to get it again and do a more aggressive taper that isn't quite as abrupt as what they are recommending. I had a seizure from alcohol two years ago and am very concerned about having another one. I've felt like I might have one doing a slow taper a few times, so the fast one really concerns me. Any advice is welcome! I'm in Tennessee if that matters.",12,{}

Been prescribed clonazepam 3mg a day for 8ish years and began tapering for 9 months to 1.25mg, I also acquired more of a taste for alcohol during this taper.  Went to treatment for a month, got out and then had to CT the rest of the way because my doc couldn't see me for about 2 weeks.

The withdrawl was nothing I've ever experienced and was absolutely horrendous.  That was almost 2 weeks ago and I began noticing massive improvements in my second week of sobriety.  I felt reborn and so happy to finally be free of benzos. I have since began working full time again and was really happy to begin working on myself and my relationships with others.  

Now I was shocked at how fast I improved, because everything I have ever read say how long it takes for withdrawl to take effect and recover from.  I was ecstatic with how things were going and assumed it was just going to get better.  

...but over the last 5 or so days I have noticed my anxiety increasing and just overall numbness beginning to set in.  It feels like I am beginning to slide backwards...this is easily the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  I'm sure it's just paws but hot damn this sucks.

I had been addicted to meth for about a year and a half, and a couple times took some bars just for ‚Äòfun‚Äô. But my consistent Xanax use came after I decided to quit using meth once and for all cold turkey and I needed to sleep for a few days. 
So I Took a bar and every time I woke up I‚Äôd use the restroom have some soup or whatever then take another half or so to fall asleep. Eventually I had no desire at all to ever do meth again considering how much it had ruined my life, but I discreetly took a liking to Xanax. Over time I kept using a little bit just to keep me from having anxiety.. kind of ‚Äòas needed‚Äô or as I assumed was medically reasonable, trying not to fall into another gnarly addiction. and well this lasted for the next 6 years. I never took multiple bars or anything like that, I would just cut a bar in 4 pieces and take a piece to relax. Once in a while I‚Äôd take like 3 pieces or half to just kick it with the homies but most of the time I tried to be rational. I remember using it if I was going to be in a car with anyone or for family get togethers or for the afternoon so i could enjoy some relaxation in the evening before going to bed.. 
anyway
Eventually after a few years maybe 5 , my depression got exponentially worse than ever. It got to the point where I had suicidal tendencies and thoughts that I couldn‚Äôt control at all. I didn‚Äôt consider that it was the Xanax at first I thought it was just my depression getting worse or the fact I had moved into my own house for the first time... just different changes but I would take a Xanax to make these thoughts go away.  Then eventually I had anxiety While on Xanax , and that was fuckin scary. So I tried to quit but couple days later had such bad anxiety I took another one and it happened again. Panic while on Xanax. 
So I quit for good, and my withdrawals lasted for months...those suicidal thoughts got worse and my arms started locking and I had a few seizures . I couldn‚Äôt believe all of this considering I would only do pretty small amounts of the Xanax but it was obvious that Xanax had fucked my brain up. I read all the self help books imaginable and had my fair share of enlightening experiences with psychedelics and have done a lot of introspection through out my life so I couldn‚Äôt believe how persistent and uncontrollable these horrible thoughts and feelings were that I got while withdrawing. 
I had faith in neuroplasticity so I told myself I would get better and every panik attack and seizure I could get through with out the Xanax would make me stronger and it did but slowlyyy.

Fast forward to now , a year since I‚Äôve taken Xanax. I still get panik attacks but Definitly not as often. Unfortunately smoking weed seems pretty intense now which sucks cause I love marijuana and see no harm in it but it did send me into psychosis a couple of times. 
I‚Äôve gone to the dr for my depression(that existed long before Xanax) and they prescribed me SSRI and I gave it a shot but I couldn‚Äôt handle the side effects so after 30 days on those I gave up on them. And now I just tell myself to keep going.. moments come around that make life more than worth living, they are just few and far between but I‚Äôm working really hard to just get stronger and expand my awareness and try to get to the root of my anxiety as depression.. even if it‚Äôs a chemical imbalance I feel that I could cure it through neuroplasticity , hard work,introspection and just self actualization. Once in a while I think a Xanax could help me feel better and I do crave one from time to time and I even have one that I‚Äôve kept in my drawer all these months. but I am scared that it just wouldn‚Äôt work to take away my anxiety and I‚Äôm more scared of how I would feel the next day because my body and brain  is just so sensitive.. 
over all I am so thankful I am through with the withdrawal and I can utilize my body and time better.. getting off it thought me how to deal with anxiety and feel strong when I get through my panic attacks even when my body completely locks up and spasms out. I feel like I am still healing and I‚Äôm at a point now where I‚Äôm over the worst part and I just need to keep pushing. I need to start going the extra mile with my life and excersize more and create more (without using drugs). I‚Äôm barely letting go of my old self and not only that but, I‚Äôm trying to envision and create my new self. I‚Äôm super thankful for music and my friends and family even though they don‚Äôt understand my perspective i still appreciate everyone very much and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way

All I knew is I felt more confident and days became easier and less stressful. At least at first...

I soon found myself popping 1-2 mg of Etizolam pellets whenever things got ‚Äúrough‚Äù or felt the least bit uncomfortable. Dosing became sporadic at times...anywhere from 3-8mg of Etizolam a day. Less than 6 months after discovering this RC benzo, I came across Clonazolam. Now, days became a blur. This shit is insanely strong and I found myself compulsively re-dosing while blacked-out. At this point I was binging on Clonazolam while concocting and consuming potent Etizolam solutions as well.

During the first year, I‚Äôd say I mainly took Etizolam during the week (3-8mg daily) and Clonazolam on the weekends (0.5-1.5mg daily). And, for the following year, I stabilized on 2-4mg Etizolam a day with occasional Clonazolam binges. I apologize I don‚Äôt have an accurate daily dosage, but I literally indulged whenever I felt slightly stressed, needed a crutch, or suffered interdose withdrawals.

After roughly 2 years, I found myself dosing more and more frequently just to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. This past August I decided I needed to quit. I ordered Diclazepam and began tapering. I started at 4mg (equivalent to ~40mg diazepam) and cycled down to 0.4mg diclazepam. 

While tapering I experienced heart-racing anxiety, cold sweats, insomnia, depersonalization, feelings of impending doom...among others. I stayed dedicated to tapering and eventually had my first clean day on Black Friday. During the taper, I felt low and depressed (but knew I was doing the right thing). After each cut, my withdrawal symptoms were amplified. After stopping completely, I‚Äôve mainly been left with sleep issues...but they‚Äôre quickly improving. I actually slept for a straight 7 hours last night (with the help of an indica edible). 

I received great advice from this subreddit and wanted to share my experience. Everyone‚Äôs body recovers differently and I honestly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm feeling so well. Stopping completely has felt MUCH more manageable than the symptoms I felt after each cut.

I smoke weed regularly (nightly) and do meditation and breathing exercises (Wim Hof). Through the heavy brain-fog, I‚Äôve managed to keep my job as a software engineer (taking occasional sick days after rough cuts). The past few days I‚Äôve felt a bit sharper and clear-headed than I have in awhile.

Currently 26, and I‚Äôm thrilled to be benzo-free and wish I never would have ‚Äúexperimented‚Äù in the first place. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions!",5,{}

I have depression, and depression and bars do not mix well. Last year I bought 100 bars of ‚Äúxanax‚Äù off the darknet. I‚Äôm not sure it was true alprazolam or if it was some RC. To start I took a couple bars that were listed as 2mg. I loved how I felt on them, the not caring about anything, the memory loss. It was an escape from being myself, and I couldn‚Äôt get enough. It ruined everything for me. I crashed my motorcycle, and two days later I self harmed to the point I had to go to the hospital. I ended up with 10 stitches, tried to fight my sister at the hospital, yelled at my family and tried to escape at 4 am. I didn‚Äôt stop there. I would eat a bar whenever my girlfriend was at work on the weekend, and try to sober up before she got home. I went to her best friends 21st birthday party fucked up on xans. A few months went by and I lost my job, the same day we  got snowed im together, to ease the pain, I don‚Äôt even remember how many bars I popped, but I ended up yelling at her and forcing her to drive 60 miles in the fucking snow to pick up my friend that I wanted to hang out with. I threw up in her car on the way home. She stayed with me. A few months went by, and we went down to another state for her great grandfathers funeral. 6-7 hour drive I thought, great idea to take a bar. I embarrassed myself in front of her family. I feel so fucking guilty. I fucked up so badly, and C if you‚Äôre reading this, I realize how much I hurt you, and I‚Äôm genuinely sorry. That was the last time I took bars. But I kept them in my hiding place this entire time. I‚Äôve had shitty days where I just want to go and pop another one and forget about the world, longing for that blissful feeling they give me. I‚Äôve almost relapsed multiple times. I‚Äôve been fighting myself but today I decided I didn‚Äôt want to fight anymore. So today I flushed the remaining 80 or so bars. And I‚Äôm goddamn proud of myself.

TL;DR: I love the feeling bars give me, and I‚Äôve been struggling to keep myself off them, even after 8 months clean. So I flushed the stash I had been keeping, and I feel so much better.",32,{}

Currently at 2.5 x 3 times per day mg is not enough, I must take more to feel the calming effect. Clearly this is a never ending upward BAD spiraling.

My psychiatrierst said i can start cutting 1/4 (which is difficult so I need a pill cutter device?), from a dose each day (just one of the three doses). For example:

1st dose:  2.5 mg

after 5 hours another 2.5 mg

before sleep 2.5 mg

So he says I can start cutting 1/4 from the 'after 5 hours of waking up' pill for 15 days.  then start cutting 1/4 from the morning pill of 2.5.  Then start cutting 1/2 from the middle day pill again, all this in stages of 15 days.

From what I read online, his suggestions sound  like he.... read those online ;)

Anyways, I am as I said unable to be benefited anymore by benzos of 7.5 mg /day in total (sometimes 10 mg/daY) so I am surely interested to withdraw and stop them ideally for ever.",3,{}

I then stupidly ended up taking 1-3mg xanax over the Weekend which sent me straight back into withdrawals the next day, I lowered the dose for 2 days following because I felt so shit then jumped off the xanax, the withdrawals were fairly manageable but the weekend came and I found myself taking 3mg over the weekend again. Found out I may be having a drug test in a week or so, diazepam is no longer an option until after the test because it will definitely show due to the long half life. 

So Monday comes (yesterday) & im feeling the withdrawals although I'm not feeling anxious I physically can't catch my breath and was being jolted awake with brain zaps when trying to sleep so I took around 0.5mg as I was worried of seizires, today I'm having the same symptoms as yesterday I just took roughly .25mg and now feeling mostly OK, should I just take roughly .1mg tomorrow then just stop cold turkey would this be relatively safe given my usage on the weekend?",3,{}

I am dependent on probably 3mg of Diclazepam and 2-5mg of Etizolam a day, just use for sleep. Let's assume I do not wish to taper myself, and want professional help doing this. I do not want advice on how to taper MYSELF, I want your experiences finding a doctor/psychiatrist that is willing to help.

So far it's been incredibly depressing. I've brought the Ashton Manual printed out to two separate doctors, was honest about what I was taking; and both said ""That's not my specialty I can't help you, I can refer you to a psychiatrist.""

However, I also have a therapist that knows all about my benzodiazepine usage and she has reached out to 3 separate psychiatrists for me that basically said they would simply refer me to a rehab center, and would not entertain the Ashton Manual.

Now I KNOW that when it comes to doctors and psychiatrists, you cannot come to them with YOUR plan; or at least in my experience they tend to like to reach what kind of treatment you need on their own which is completely fine; they went to med school not me.

But I'm feeling like I'm screwed. Even while being completely honest about my situation (dependent but hold down a well paying accounting job, i have a masters degree)  it seems impossible to find any sort of healthcare practitioner that is willing to do anything even after reading the Ashton Manual.

**To those that have had success finding a professional to aid in tapering safely, did it just take trial and error?** I hear about success stories all the time where even a nurse practitioner helped someone titrate down. I just feel like I'm blowing money trying to get help but no one wants to help me...which is ironic because I've accepted that I want and need help with this but now that I reach out I get treated like I have to deal with this on my own.

**It's just sad that with complete honestly I'm offered nothing so far. Am I supposed to go to a doctor/psych and lie and say I was legally prescribed X benzo blah blah blah need help getting off...? Kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out in my eyes if I'm not being open**.

WHY NOT TAPER MYSELF? Because I'm at a point where I know I can't do this alone, and even if I can, I want help from a professional.

WHY NOT GO TO REHAB? 1) I don't have the money, insurance 2) It takes months to come off benzos safely AND with a little discomfort as possible (I've CT'd before, had 2 zeizures, 4 months didn't feel any better so started taking again to be able to have an income). Stupid I know, but am I supposed to spend months at a rehab center? 3) I'm gonna get shit for this, but I don't mentally crave benzos, never have; just always had horrible insomnia and didn't realize my usage to curb it was getting out of hand. I hate having to take this crap to feel normal.

K that was longer than I meant it to be.

\--Thanks so much for everyone's responses so far! I really appreciate it :)

Update: thanks for all the responses again. I‚Äôm functioning on diclazepam but still having trouble finding a psych that will even look at the Ashton manual. 

Other than that, life‚Äôs good. Just dependent on benzos but working a good job and taking care of business. Maybe I‚Äôll just be on them forever! Kidding.",12,{}

I‚Äôve been taking Benzos (primarily Diazepam as scripted + some here and there) for 5 years. For almost 6 months now I‚Äôve been taking between 3-6mg etizolam a day along with 5mg diazepam. I‚Äôve recently switched my regime to 10mg diazepam 7am, 1mg etiz, 11am, 1mg etiz around 5pm then 5mg Diazepam at around 8pm. I‚Äôve been on this for a week, prior to that I was pretty careless with dosing but never went to far over the top.

Yesterday was the first day I dropped to 15mg diaz and 2mg etiz in total, I want to stay at that for a while then drop another mg of etiz, ultimately only taking it PRN or max once a day - I have quite the surplus - enough to last quite a while...

My main question is, do you think SOMA would be helpful in possibly eliminating/substituting etizolam over the next month or so?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

From what I remember during this time it was going rather well.  We did struggle every now and then and I had a bit of a drinking problem.  But for the most part it wasn't so bad.  

I began a clonazepam taper 9 months ago and that's when it all fell apart.  Drinking became more frequent and spent that whole time depressed and and in and out of institutions.  Work was very hard to go too and we were financially struggling.  She and I didnt understand what I was going through and it began tearing us apart.  I said and did things that I regret now and I cant go back in time to fix anything.

I spent October and part of November in a treatment program and we separated during that time.  I have since been clean from both (with the clonazepam being a real bitch) and now that I can think clearly it tears me apart inside knowing I hurt her so bad.  What's worse is that we still live together and she has been talking to another guy...God I hate thinking about it.  

I just want to fix things and myself but keeping my emotions under control has been very tricky since I'm still new to being sober.  Everyone always says focus on yourself, but how do I do that when I know I did so much damage?
