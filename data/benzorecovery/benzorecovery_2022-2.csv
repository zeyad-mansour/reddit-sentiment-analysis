I have been on Clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime for 4 years. I can honestly say it hasn't really done wonders for me or done anything really for my anxiety. Ever since my ADHD diagnosis and getting on meds I have far less anxiety on my ADHD meds than I do on my anxiety meds. I am ready to come off but I am absolutely terrified of what will happen or how badly I will react to any kind of withdrawal. I'm just looking for some hope here that it won't be absolutely terrible and that I haven't fucked up my brain forever. This community seems wonderful and knowledgeable and I'm looking forward to anyone who would like to commiserate or offer, hope or offer any tips or tricks. Thank you all so much! ❣️",3

It has been 2 weeks since I have been off Clonazepam and Diazepam and you can do the same! 

Last year in and around this same time I started to go for walks since my anxieties were building up like so many others because of the pandemic uncertainty…

In and around this time I also headed to the hospital and a social worker encouraged me to keep walking (so that I did!) 

As long as I social distanced I was okay and 2 times a week turned into 5 days  which overall made me feel great! 

My anxiety lowered, feel good endorphins hit me and my thinking became clearer! 

This prompted me to do what I always  wanted to do since 2018 which was to get off Clonazepam! 

I took the plunge and cut my 2mg down by getting it in smaller forms of 0.5 and every 2 weeks I’d reduce by a half…

By the time I got to 1mg I had terrible debilitating anxiety, panic, and tremors mixed with doomed morning depression! 

This made me head to the hospital, and they switched me to Diazepam 5mg

I tapered weekly from here, but it was too  quick yall! (I ended up going to the hospital again!)

This time I was at a hospital in a bigger metropolitan area and was kept overnight and they bumped me up to 8mg of Diazepam…

I became stable again but was afraid to taper till the fall of last year…

I couldn’t sleep, was sad, and mood out of wack! 

This was the point of no return I said so I tapered late November into December and by January I got down to 5 mg…

The lower I got the easier it was to sleep but was uncomfortable anxiety wise too…

I accidentally got into cbd gummies which helped me during the end then I jumped ship though… (2 weeks ago) 

So, never let anyone tell you it isn’t possible because it is! 

I used to be a longtime lurker too! Ha! 

You guys are VERY instrumental in my recovery! I don’t think you realize how many people lurk this subreddit! 

Now, I’m here to help! No more hiding! 

Go team go!

I'm now on my third day of not taking it, I'm concerned, should I have tapered down?

I've heard from people who have jobs and cannot afford *any* time off, as well as people who are able to make the choice to put a pause on life, step back from the world and give themselves time and space in order to heal. I personally am ***very*** grateful to have a part-time job that pays well enough for me to support myself, as well as make my own hours in order to work around my symptoms (Diazepam taper - currently crash landing @ a 5mg dose). Sometimes I wonder if it will get worse, and if I'll need to stop working for a while altogether. Though I have faith that won't be the case if I continue to remain true to my taper plan and live my life *quite* differently then I had been.

I'd love to hear of your circumstance. How have you given yourself space during this difficult time, both in the past or in the present? I personally think it's **really** important that we give ourselves this space and perhaps even more important that we are Understanding and Compassionate toward ourselves and our situation when doing so.

Thanks for anybody/everybody's input. Life is precious; let's continue to treat it as such.

\*EDIT\* - If you don’t want to vote it's been a day and it currently sits at a close **27-28 split.** 27 people are either part time or full time during recovery, and 28 people are currently unemployed for their recovery. Thanks for the insight folks!

Have you detoxed from one benzo you were on longer and then another you were on for a shorter amount of time after? Anything help you get through the post acute withdrawal period?",3

I decided to see the doctor before I ran out and he has referred me to local drug recovery with an appointment on Monday to taper off.

He told me to just keep on taking my illicit supply in the meantime. However thanks to the dark market i used going in to exit scam I’ve ran out completely today so I just had to call the office to try to speak to the same doctor.

They didn’t have any appointments except emergency and I said I think it is an emergency, I’ve ran out of medication. She said WHY have you ran out of medication in the most fucked up tone and I was kind of taken aback and didn’t know what to say and I was like look I’m on diazepam and I don’t have any left until my appointment with drug recovery. She repeated DRUG RECOVERY like as if she was shocked. After that she was so rude to me and hung up the phone after saying the doctor would call. He has and he has prescribed me 3 pills to get me to Monday which is all I wanted. He kept saying he wouldn’t usually do this but going cold turkey is dangerous. 

I just feel super embarrassed. Our initial appointment where he referred me to the recovery place felt super embarrassing and awkward also. He kept asking if he should be worried about my son who is two. I feel like a junkie and that everyone is looking at me like a junkie. Obviously my anxiety is sky high so don’t know if it’s just in my head. I’m worried people think I’m incapable as a mother or if this could ever be used against me to prove I’m incompetent.

Kindling is definitely true, every time was more difficult than the last. I can't imagine trying again, I would rather die.

It feels like my hands are tied and I'm going to kill myself whether I get off of benzos or not. I can't live with them and I can't live without them, it feels like I have no options.

Do i try to quit again and be completely unable to go to school and live my life normally, or do I stay on them and deal with these side effects of benzos (cognitive decline and depression) and finish college and get a job and set myself up to get clean in my 30's?

I have no one to help me. I've always been extremely resilient and independent due to my upbringing. But benzos have brought me to my knees and nobody seems to grasp what I'm dealing with. I'm just a drug addict to most people.",27

On my last day, I.e. day before yesterday I took 5mg etizolam. 
It’s been what 38 hours since my last dose. And oh my fucking god, just kill ke now. 
I almost had a dissociative episode yesterday. I was prone to those some 3 years ago, but just had one yesterday. I have been lying in bed all this time, sweating my way into the bedsheet. I have had 3 panic attacks, during all of which I felt like I was about to lose my mind and my sanity (which is still a very real fear). I have a constant racing mind, a very very nervous nervous system. Constantly on edge. One hour feels too long passing by. And the mood swings. Anxious one second, distract forget the anxiety for a while until it creeps itself back. 
I am sleeping though, which might be a good sign. Like 5-6 hours in the  past 3 days.

You can imagine all the questions running through my mind. How long is this acute phase gonna last? Am I going to make it through? How am I going to make it through?
But most of all, how much longer is this acute phase going to last? I am not coming off clonazepam anymore. That was a long ass haul, acute phase lasting much longer, due to the longer half life. But what’s the timeline here? I just ripped the band-aid. 

It’s like there’s no fighting this nervous system storm.

Edit: I am just letting the storm pass through. But it feels never ending. I need some directions. I got a job starting Monday. Rehab feels like the easy way out and I have always taken the easy way for everything. This time I want to fight through, start the job, keep it and also fight the wds at home, so that I don’t burn through money I don’t have.

I have access to a psychiatrist. I have 5 tablets of  clonazepam 0.25. I have had these tablets prn SOS for over 15 days. I like to keep them as people keep for extinguishers. In case I start dissociating and can’t control it.",4

I'm not there yet but I can feel it and the Withdrawals/Symptoms have started to be easier for some reason after crossing below the 2.5mg barrier (maybe because therapudic threshold is 2mg).  


Last hold was 1 week and I was fine, so this past Monday I dropped from 2mg to 1mg.  I only plan on holding 1 week and jumping off this circus ride, giving myself 2 weeks if for some reason things get really bad out of nowhere.

I've had a new script for a snri (Effexor) that I've been scared to take. The other day I woke up early, had someone at home with me all day and planned to take it. I took my klonopin to calm. I was waiting for it to kick in to start to Effexor but when it kicked in I had a terrible response. I spent the next 30 hrs in a bad scary klonopin high. Bad paranoia, racing thoughts, visual and audio distortions, numbness unable to talk or move. For the past several months the klonopin has been hit or miss with how it effects me. Sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't feel like enough sometimes it causes me to freak out.

Anyways I talked to my psychiatrist explaining that I didn't take the Effexor yet and now I'm even more scared because my klonopin may fail me again like that. He said my gaba receptors have become desensitized and I had a paradoxical reaction. I talked to him about the Ashton method and he is aware of it and said with the low dose I'm on he'd just send the valium and I could start it and not take the klonopin.

So right now the goal is to take the Valium and the Effexor and hope that the Effexor works well for me so that I can get off the benzos alltogether except for emergencies only.

TLDR: Has anyone had success with switching to valium while in klonopin dependency to kick the klonopin and especially if you've done this while trying to stabilize on a safer medication?",3

- some backstory on my dependence/taper: i was originally prescribed xanax at 16 for panic attacks, a month later when it stopped working i was switched to klonopin. im not sure of the dosages initially but i very quickly reached 2mgs kpins daily, and continued that for 4-5 years. i occasionally took more because it obviously, stopped working over time. i had no idea of the dangers or the dependency and would not have EVER touched this drug if i had known. 
-in 2020 i decided i was done & wanted off of them. they stopped working and i felt awful even when i took them. i found a doctor willing to taper me. i was swapped to 28mgs of diazepam. the first month or two of the switch was hard, i didnt feel like a person most days but i adjusted quickly and felt fine for majority of my taper. the problems came when i hit around 16mgs and down. i would have some off days, but once i hit 12mgs things were hell constantly. i honestly don't remember much of my taper now, im not sure if my brain blocked it out because of how traumatic it was or if i really was so out of reality that it's impossible for me to now put myself back in that mindset. i had insomnia prior but nothing to this extent. i relied on melatonin & still didnt sleep most nights. was in a constant state of doom, severe dp/dr, just to name a few of my symptoms. i remember for months i was convinced i had died or was in a coma and this wasnt real life i was living. my taper lasted 9 1/2 months, i sped it up at the end, i couldnt take it anymore and knew i wouldnt heal until i was off of them. 
-the first 4 months off was awful. none of my symptoms really subsided and i was beginning to feel helpless. i had my first window at month 4, it was about two weeks. without that window im unsure i wouldve continued. i needed some reassurance that i wasn't permanently damaged. at month 5 i went into an outpatient treatment because my will to live was close to gone. i had multiple breakdowns about the fact that i did not think this would ever end. at month 6-7 most symptoms went over or faded to the point of things being tolerable. my waves were weeks instead of months, and the bad days werent as bad as they once were. at this point i started living my life moreso normally than i had been able too for the last 2 years. at month 8 i started considering myself healed but it wasnt until month 10 that i really felt healed. at month 11 i finally gained my sleep back. 
- there is no way i can fit everything i want to say in this post so i am open to questions, comments, and private messages.
- my point in making this post is to give hope. i was once where a lot of you are and i remember how reading these posts would keep me alive for another day. my anxiety now is so unbelievably manageable, i am so appreciative of being alive and being able to enjoy moments with my friends and partner again. i feel like a person again and it is beautiful. i started college at 23, im now in my second semester and have a 4.0 gpa, im going into psychology in hopes of being able to find other licensed professionals to create a treatment facility specific to those of us tapering. it is so scary, i know how hard it is to do alone and how truly alone you feel.
YOU CAN DO IT. take everything day by day- if that is too much, take it hour by hour. tell yourself ""i am going to make it through the next 10 minutes, then repeat.
- it is hard, it does suck,but i promise all of you - you will heal. be patient, be kind to yourself. i am so proud of you.",15

These were 4mg presses and I was taking about 4-8mg almost every day for around 3 weeks. Once those ran out, I bought more from a different source. This second batch were 2mg each, but they did not have that bitter alprazolam taste so I can't say for certain what they were other than some kind of benzo. I used these for maybe 5-6 weeks, taking about 2-4mg (occasionally up to 8mg) again not quite every day but close. Around 3-4 weeks ago I stopped taking these xanax presses and started taking between 2-6mg of etizolam basically every night.

Two weeks or so ago I discovered that I am unable to sleep unless I take etizolam, so I finally realized that I need to stop. I first tried to stop cold turkey, but on the third night without sleep I took 2mg of etizolam as I felt that I was losing my mind. Since then, for the past 10 days, I've been taking .5-1mg of etizolam every other day in order to sleep every other night.

I'm not sure if I should continue this semi-taper with another week of .25-.5mg etizolam every other day, or if I should try spacing this out to every 3 days, or if I should try a longer taper at .25-.5mg every night, or just stop cold turkey again.

The most significant symptom I am having is insomnia. I also experience some tinnitus, and an odd pressure in the front of my brain most noticeable at night when I try to sleep without taking any etizolam.

I really want to stop cold turkey, but it's very difficult at night and I'm not sure if I'm making it more difficult by using a lower dose every other night as opposed to just reducing the dosage but continuing to use every night in order to get at least a few hours of sleep each night, or if it's best to jump off at this point where I have been taking about .5mg etizolam every other night for the past week.

If anyone here has any advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",5

It’s so damn hard I wanna shoot myself or jump out of a window. The anxiety I’m feeling is crazy. Goddamn it this is hard. I have no idea how I’m gonna survive the next 1.5 month (in 1.5 month I’m going on a spiritual retreat to try to heal from my OCD, which is at the cause of my anxiety, which is the reason I started to take Xanax).

I didn't realise how long I'd be in hospital for; so I didn't bring any valium. I must say the withdrawals were the most painful part of it all. For the first 3 days until the doctor finally took pity and prescribed 5mg a day I couldn't stop sweating, was having audio hallucinations  and generally felt like I was going to die (and its what I atleast imagine hell to be like). I've been hooked since 2016, how am I going to undo this curse without wanting to snuff it as it seems like an easier option?",6

Right now, I am around 20 hours into withdrawal. From etizolam. Everything sucks. Everything feels dark and seems gloomy at the moment. Fortunately, I haven’t had a seizure yet.

I relapsed around 8-10 days ago. 15-16 days ago, I left clonazepam after tapering. But the wd symptoms were still too much to handle and I got a good job opportunity but had too much anxiety to handle it. So after 5-6 days in wd, I relapsed on etizolam. Since then I had been taking around 3.5mg/day until my doc cut me off yesterday, FOR GOOD. She gave me the option to taper etizolam, to come and collect daily prescriptions so that there is no way to abuse. 
I know I had only been abusing for a little over a week and tapering would be slow torture again, so I just quit cold turkey yesterday. 

You can probably check my post history. I have had made numerous attempts at withdrawal since October last year. My longest wd attempt was 1 month and shortest was 3 days. I have attempted wd 6-7 times now. Maybe more. Everytime I’d give in to reinstatement.

It’s been a different kind of hell since September October last year. Quitting withdrawing recovering reinstating, constant stress tension anxiety. Neither am I able to afford a rehab at the moment nor do I have the luxury of time to attend one.

I just want to know an accurate timeline of  withdrawal. 5 half lifes of etizolam is 40 hours right, 2 days?!

Truly, I have had it. I am sick of it. It sucks more getting on and off benzos than, either just being on them or being off them.

Edit: In the spirit of full transparency and getting the right help; I failed almost all my wd attempts because I gave in to alcohol or some other substance and I could never overcome my mental anxiety of facing people with benzodiazepine so as to be able to create a successful workout exercise regimen

Edit: I would really love it if I can just sleep tonight",3

This is going to be somewhat long, so bare with me. So a buddy and I used to order large quantities of etizolam online. We were getting powder etizolam and etizest/etilaam tablets. I started off online buying the PG liquid solutions. I was taking maybe like 1-2mg per day. That quickly spiraled out of control due to easy and cheap access to etizolam. Towards the end, I was taking anywhere between 40-60mg etizolam per day or more. I did this for close to 2 years straight.

My friend went to get some drug addiction help and I was fucked. I finally ran out of everything. I did have a nice stockpile of other benzos like meclonazepam, fluclotizolam, flualprazolam and clonazolam. But eventually ran out of those too. About 24 hours into my withdrawal, I was sitting on the toilet, butt naked and my kids kept asking me if I was OK. I just responding ""Yea, man"". Really shitty of me as a father to put my kids through this and deeply regret them having to see me go through this. They called 911, the ambulance came and picked me up. Took me to the hospital.  


Mentally, I was in a whole different world. I was incoherent, couldnt really walk, couldnt speak. I literally felt like I was in a state of some sort of mental retardation. I could not sit still. I kept like jerking my legs and arms and yelling. Not in a resisting help way, but like going crazy.  


At the hospital, I seen, heard and felt things that I cannot describe and do not wish upon anyone. The first day in the ICU, I think I had a couple of seizures. I remember briefly having a out of body exp of watching my heart monitor flatline, and the nurses and everyone just looked at me. I pissed myself (because when you die, all bodily fluids will be excreted sometimes) and then I was in hell. Literal ""Hell."" But it wasnt burning fire and smoke and darkness. It was more terrifying than that. Don't know how to explain it. I woke up and came to, and I think I was watching the TV and it was like 1 commercial was on replay, over and over again.  


When I got transferred to the stepdown ICU, that's when some serious hullicinations started. The hospital staff were singing to me and were going to give me prizes and cruises. I called them a bunch of bitches in my head and they knew I did that, so they switched it up on me and started trying to poison me. They would remotely control my TV channel to something scary, like a murder mystery. They were remotely controlling my bed, making it vibrate and move and do wierd stuff. I was talking to nurses about how I was going to jail. And the jail nurses ending up coming to the hospital to take me away, but they never did take me and eventually they left. This one nurse in specific was trying to poison me with potassium pills. Everytime I took them, my ears started ringing and my head would start spinning.  


In the end, I made it home alive and I was still in extreme withdrawal. I was severely hullicinating, tremoring, heart racing, high blood pressure. I ended up getting into a detox center. At this point, I had not had any benzodiazepines in my system for over 2 weeks roughly. And it was a long fucking 2 weeks, let me tell you. They gave me 4mg of lorazepam. I layed back down to try to rest. I woke up in the ICU of a different hospital because I apparently became extremely violent and went crazy. I had a total blackout. Went back to the detox center and they did a 3 day librium taper(Yes, only 3 days). After that, it took about 6 months to a year to get back to mostly normal. Yes, I know. 3 days is fucking rediculous. I was still in moderate withdrawal after leaving the detox center. But my mental state was about 50% restored to normal. I could communicate again. After about a month, I was safe to drive again. This whole experience left me with severe trauma. Obviously, those things that happened in the first hospital were hullicinations, but I was not aware of it at the time. Anyone here struggling with severe benzo dependence, I understand.

I was later prescribed more meds like benzos for months and months that harmed me and I am suffering still from the damage, trying to heal. 

Since then, I’ve tried for two years to not only heal after being harmed neurologically and physically from the anti biotic and subsequent Benzos, but from STILL having the h pylori infection as well as SIBO and SIFO. I most recently worked with a practitioner for 12 weeks on a huge natural protocol and not only did I STILL have h pylori at the end, I now also suffer from constipation and faecal impactions since the supplement regime. I did black seed oil, garlic capsules, GSE, pomegranate, MCT oil, NAC, mastic gum, pro biotics etc, a huge list. I felt sooo sick whilst I was doing it too. 

I am desperate and at a bit of a dead end. I’ll obviously never take flagyl again and I am very against taking clarithromycin or a fluroquinolone antibiotic as both have too many known side effects also. 

I am having a colonoscopy and gastroscopy next week. They will isolate the HP and test what abx it is resistant to. I will then completely allergy testing to see if I’m still allergic to penicillin. If I am I will do exposure therapy to try to desensitise the allergy/if I’m not I am thinking of trying out or going ahead with this treatment using amoxicillin:

The problem is i have no idea how much i was using jn a day. And constant redosing

My plan for taper 3 days: flubromazolam liquid .5 morning and night
Then day 4 go to .4ml 
And so on till i get till i get till .1ml

To perscribed clonazopam. Im persribed 15 .5 a month. So depending on how i feel take a half of .5 for 4 days. Then down to a 1/4 4 days. Switching days on and off 1/4. Maybe and 1/8 if i can get that small day on and off till off.

I to have plenty if 300mg Gabapentin to take throughout this as needed between dosing.

I know there is not lot of info on research chemical benzodiazepines. I was hoping someone could either send me the right redit direction if im inthe wrong section. 

does this sound good? Its really hard for me to find taper information on research chemical benzodiazepines. I can not find better research chemical for tappering. I can get bromazolam if its better for tapper i just dont have it now.

I am very lucky im on a paid 6 week paid leave (can be extended if needed). This is unrelated. I should also mention they are switching my anti depressants. I was having bad reactions to mirtazapine that was not noticing but others were. So they are switching me to lexapro. Doctors plan half mirtazapine at night half lexapro in morning. For 6 days. Then after day 6 go fully to lexapro.

- 450mg Lyrica per day (dose 2x day)
- Wellbutrin 450mg/day

Idk if the dosing seems like I’m exaggerating or ya idc but I’ve yet to see anyone that is on the amount of shit I’m on.

I’ve tapered off Suboxone before. But I’m stuck at this amount of xanax I tried going lower and I went crazy I couldn’t manage.. and every day is still a hit or miss nightmare.

I fr think I’m stuck on this for life. Everything gives me anxiety and huge cortisol spikes.
Diagnosed w severe depressive disorder, severe generalized anxiety disorder, sever social anxiety disorder, and down to moderate OCD..

Anyone ever got off this high of doses of benzos/mix? Don’t post horror stories please I just want to know if this is even worth trying. And if time is necessary for an answer it’s been about 5 years.

I was prescribed an SSRI to treat my anxiety but SSRIs make my anxiety 100x times worse. My General Anxiety Disorder morphs into full blown Panic Disorder. As such, I was prescribed Lorazepam to manage the panic attacks. I was prescribed 10, 0.5 mg tablets which I went thru pretty quick and then 15 1mg tablets. First dose was NYE, last dose was Feb 10th. I did take more from friends because I was unable to effectively manage my anxiety with the amount I was prescribed. There also was a few times I was abusing them for recreational purposes but most of that was during a 3 day bachelor party in Mexico, I can only recall one time I abused them otherwise. Total daily use was about a 3-4 week period. 

I’ve been clean for 10 days now and had a miserable 4 day battle with rebound anxiety. I’m still dealing with rebound insomnia. My question is this, I have a nicotine vape thats become an everyday thing for me, that’s definitely an addiction. I also have been slowly reintroducing caffeine into my diet in the mornings but couldn’t for the first 5 days. But I drank an energy drink at noon on Friday and I haven’t been right until this morning. Should I be quitting those two altogether? Or just listen to my body and stop when I’m receiving signals? There’s really not much information out there on what to expect for someone dealing with rebound symptoms (rather than full blown withdrawal) from short term use. I’d ask a psychiatrist but the one I had was just awful so I got rid of her this past Monday. Any advice is appreciated!",2

It may seem simple but at first coming of drugs your life may be in a state of ruin with lost jobs, cars, house etc...  

I first got a job as soon as I recovered and it gave me tremendous pride.  I've been focusing on eating well and caring about other people who I can help.  

Now I've been working out and taking things slower.  I physically move slowly but I still have plenty of time to get things done.  As I work and gain money and look physically strong again (I've been post jump 52 days and yesterday was my birthday)  now working out is bug because I've gained about 40 lbs of solid muscle and nothing scares me anymore.  I'll put my fist through another human in a split second and the way I can't help but look at people they know ill do it too.  About 6 foot 200 lbs solid really helps my anxiety a lot. The bigger and stronger I get the less fear I have really.

As a last resort if people know you were addicted to something and that your not anymore 99.99% show a ton of respect for that really its extremely stressful relieving ...  I'll let someone know in a heartbeat that my brain was F*cked  up and not to mess with me and it helps me then I get nervous seriously it's it's tremendous relief.  Sometimes they will ask why don't you take medicine and well then we chat for a second.

Anyways these thins have a helped me a lot and I hope mabye you can take some of It with you and help you too.

Your poly-addicted friend in Wisconsin (ex junky) 
Sean 36M

PS - I've found that if your sober most of the time no matter what you do may seem stupid but it gives you like a free hall pass to do whatever you want most of the time I mean it's liberating in a way I can't describe.  I understand these are all basic common sense things but it all works if done right.

Another PS - last thing too -- I have aches and pains and sometimes I can feel my heart and I have to absolutely just ignore what my body is doing.  I have 100%  accepted that if I am meant to live I will live and if it's my time to die I will die like the millions / billions have before me.  And that seems to help me all these things in combination throughout my long boring days now....",5

2022-02-19 10:42:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/swctoi/my_journey_to_benzofree_life_after_7_years/,My journey to Benzo-free life after 7 years!,"Hey everyone, after 7 long years I am successfully 100% benzo free!  It has been a long and often difficulty journey - now that I am on the other side, I feel amazing and wish I had been brave enough to remove the benzo-handcuffs years ago.  This post is encourage you all to stick with it through the hard times and push to get to zero - the negative side effects will end and you will get your life back!

Note:  This post is me sharing my personal journey and not to be taken as medical advice - I am not a doctor, just a regular person.

Seven years ago I was prescribed .5mg Clonazepam by my doctor for anxiety.  At first it worked great and then I decided I was feeling good and ready to “stop” taking it after a month.  The withdrawal effects were brutal - elevated heart rate, insomnia, nightmares, sweats, jolts to the body and muscles, spasms, mental fogginess and general discomfort.

Days turned into weeks and months turned into years of taking Clonazepam as I was unsure how to confront the nasty side effects of withdrawal.  Quite frankly, it was “easier” for me to keep taking it than to confront the difficult challenge of stopping.

Around 1 year ago I came across the **Ashton Manual** ([https://benzo.org.uk/manual/](https://benzo.org.uk/manual/)) which is absolutely critical for you to read every single word.  The manual is a guide for how to taper off as well as what to expect along the way.  I decided to do a slow taper to lessen the effect of withdrawal.  Every 2 weeks, I lessened my dosage by around 10% in slow increments.  The taper process was hard, I had withdrawal symptoms from small step downs and even had setbacks where I had to stay at the same level or increase to combat benzo sickness.  My first goal was to taper off during the course of one year.

After testing a slow taper for nearly a year, I decided it was time to get off entirely.  My doctor reduced my dosage to 0.25 mg and eventually 0.125 mg Clonazepam (which is the lowest amount prescribed to my knowledge).  Towards the end, it was so hard to break down the pill to follow the taper schedule so I bought a small weighted scale on Amazon for $20 to ensure I was being accurate when breaking down the pill.  Some people may say this is a very small amount and shouldnt cause and withdrawal symptoms but they are wrong - I am very sensitive to benzos and the withdrawal symptoms are intense even at low levels after a long period of use.

To my understanding, withdrawal intensity correlates to two factors 1) dosage amount and 2) length of use.  While my dosage amount was small, my length of use was long and my body had become dependent on benzos to function.

After reading the Ashton Manual, I decided to improve my lifestyle for the final taper process - cutting out alcohol, reducing caffeine (small amount of coffee early in the day is okay but not at night), eating healthy, exercise and reducing stress in my life.

The final taper is the hardest and the withdrawal symptoms are the most sever.  I went with 25% reductions every two weeks for the final 8 weeks off a very small base amount.  I think the key here is never to make drastic changes, everything needs to be done slowly over time as your body regains the basic functions around the nervous system that it had outsourced to benzos.

I read somewhere that the half-life of Clonazepam is quite long and therefore it can remain in your system for around 3 weeks +/- after the final dosage.  I made it my final goal to quit 100% and make it to the three week mark to see how my body feels off of Benzos.

After finally taking my last dose, the withdrawal symptoms kicked in:

**Week 1** \- The symptoms hit hardest starting Day 2 through Day 7 including insomnia, racing heart, muscle jolts and spasms, nightmares, brain zaps during sleep, sweats, dizziness, mental fogginess and emotional irritability.

**Week 2** \- Definite improvements from Week 1 but still not feeling great.  Racing heart, nightmares, mental fogginess, spaciness and some dizziness and irritability.

**Week 3** \- Slight mental fogginess (better each day), bouts of anxiety under stressful situations, spaciness.

**Week 4** \- MADE IT!!  Benzos have left my system and it was a real morale boost to cross the three week threshold.  Honestly, I am feeling wonderful and nearly 100%.  Still some anxiety feelings and mental fogginess occasionally but I would prefer that any day over benzos.  I am sleeping better than I have in years.  I sleep well 6 out of 7 days per week.

I also know that my symptoms will only improve over time.  After many years of benzo use, it takes months and maybe even years +/- for the body to regain functions that were dormant as you were taking the pill.

Advice:

* Withdrawal symptoms are normal and part of the recovery process. Please read the **Ashton Manual** ([https://benzo.org.uk/manual/](https://benzo.org.uk/manual/)) as a guide so you understand how to listen to your body and what it means.  It is long but you need to read every word - its worth taking back control of your life.  If you have severe symptoms, contact a doctor or emergency room immdiately.
* A slow taper process over many months is critical, you should never try to stop taking a high dosage and going straight to zero, this is not a recipe for success.
* Improve your lifestyle and focus on staying healthy and off other drugs and substances that might disrupt your taper process.
* Stay focused and set a goal - for me the first goal was to taper off over one year and then it was 3 weeks off of benzos.

Conclusion, I am at week 4 off of benzos and never looking back.  This forum was an incredible source of information and inspiration along the way.  Yes, there are good days and bad days but I would encourage you to stick with the Ashton Manual process and know that there is absolutely a light on the other side and it does get better!",15

Is there a huge difference in how lorazepam works vs how clonazepam works? I was on clonazepam for about 5 years in the past and it was amazing for my mental health at the time. I felt normal and functional. Now, it feels like it's exacerbating my anxiety and panic disorder so I'm incredibly confused. 

Any help or input is greatly appreciated. It's Saturday so I can't get a hold of my doctor... I'm supposed to be working today but I'm having trouble even typing this out, and I'm already worried about returning to work tomorrow morning.

# This post is an update in regards to the new Zoom Support Group I'll be facilitating in the coming weeks. It was Great to see the interest exists for this sort of meeting. New details are included below.

*First off, I'd like everybody to know who I am. My name is Tyler, I'm from the East Coast of Canada, and  I am a 29 year old male Healthcare worker with professional training in Therapeutic Facilitation. My Diploma and practice is in Therapeutic Recreation Facilitation; however, this discipline can be utilized for a variety of different contexts. I have worked in Harm Reduction Centers as a Case Worker, and I've been the client in those very harm reduction centers as well. I have first hand, as well as professional experience with addictions involving (but not limited to) opiates, cocaine and benzodiazepine's.*

With that being said, this context of group facilitation is a new endeavor for me. To give full disclosure,  I am currently using benzodiazepines and tapering with moderate success. Facilitating this group, I will not be 'above' or 'ahead' of anybody in any way. I am starting this project to help *myself* *as well as others.* I hope to create a space where anybody can join even to just better understand that they're not alone.

**Benzodiazepine Support Group; Early Details**

* Once Weekly, 45-60 Minute Zoom Meetings
* Meeting open to anybody who has or has had experience living with benzodiazepine dependency
* Option to remain fully anonymous; enter whichever name you'd like as the meeting launches

While all can/will remain anonymous, this is not BA or ""Benzo's Anonymous"". There will be little to no reference to God or a higher power. No redundant reciting's about ""jails, institutions and death"". *If you do wish to share how your beliefs support you, that is fine.* The meeting may also follow parts of NA/AA formatting; this is simply for structure.

**The Meeting**

* Each meeting will start with a brief introduction to the idea behind the purpose of the group; a brief opening statement, written by me to begin the meeting. This group is new to *all of us,* and there are many forms that it has the possibility of taking; that will be noted as well to remind us that we're all in this together.
* Each meeting's introduction will follow with a reading from a particular text. The readings will come from various sources, including stoic philosophy texts, various recovery books (ie. memoirs, phycology books, etc.) and perhaps even relevant text from the book of NA or AA; there is *very* useful knowledge/wisdom in these texts and while they may be used as a reading, there will little to no use of terms regarding a Higher Power or God as we know it.
* After the reading, similar to other recovery groups, there will be a topic or 2 to discuss, likely regarding the reading. Everybody will have the chance to openly share and discuss their thoughts. *It does not have to be about the reading if you simply have something to share - but try to relate it to the topic if possible.*
* In the unlikely case that the reading/topic of the day is not resonating with those in the meeting, there will be the option for a more 'free-ranged' discussion regarding recovery in general. However, I have found that topics and readings catalyze discussion more often then not.

**Closing Out**

* Each meeting will be closed out with a reciting of the \*\*'\*\****Serenity Mantra'*** *: May we allow ourselves the Serenity to accept what can't be changed, the courage to change what we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.* The serenity prayer is helpful no matter your belief - so we'll be using it as a mantra to understand and appreciate it's context.
* There will be a short personal reading of my own, to remind us all of the abilities we have when we know that we're not alone and we know that we're all working hard toward the same thing. Clarity.
* Final moments of the meeting will be for the floor of anybody wishes to share anything in regards to their tapering, breakthroughs, or anything small worth celebrating before officially closing out.

I hope these details help everyone understand what this sort of unique Zoom meeting will have to offer. I am wide open to suggestions. If anybody has anything they'd like to add/suggest you can comment below or message me directly.

Now that I have introduced the idea of this meeting and understand there is interest, these details will remain posted, and an official date and time will be scheduled for the first meeting in the coming days. Ideally, the first 'test' meeting **will** be taking place in the next 7-10 days.

\**Please let me know if there is a general time of day that works best for the majority of those interested. I am still having some difficulty deciding on a time for this meeting\* .*

Thanks so much to all of you who have taken interest in this cool new way for us to connect and feel closer in our recovery's. As one of my dear friends, who I lost to this battle years ago said to me:

So for about a year I've been irregularly abusing benzos, taking about 3mg or more lorazepam at once, at first was rarely, then once every week, then I was craving so it was once a week, only in the morning and the high lasted 2 days. Anyway it started making me feel more and more uncomfortable, so I stopped, cold turkey. Insomnia the same night so I took diazepam to put me to sleep. Had various symptoms on that first week and after 7 days it peaked manifesting as a panic attack, brain fog, accompanied by severe nausea, so I went to the ER and got a metoclopramide prescription. I did not vomit that day and metoclopramide didnt help with the nausea. I didnt sleep at all during the night. The next day I puked but the only thing that came out was the meto I took 30mins before. The nausea has always been much worse when I wake up but sometimes it's the opposite. 

After a month around christmas it seemed to be slowly getting better but I suffered another major panic attack that had an unrelated cause and since I didnt believe I could experience benzo withdrawal I took diazepam. For the entire month of january I took diazepam irregularly and in very high doses (up to 30mg), and felt generally fine, last time I took it was 10 days ago, but this time I only took 10mg. Two days later I threw up once again in the morning after having breakfast. Since then I felt a general lack of appetite like in december that made it impossible to eat even a little, nausea though not as severe as the first month, panic attacks, and shaking of my body, along with memory problems, brain fog, and weight loss. I vomited in the morning a few days ago, what triggered the nausea was eating a full meal like I used to very fast and it lasted till the next morning, when I threw up (i didnt not throw up the meal though, only some stomach acid). I do not feel a lack of appetite though, I feel hungry just like normal but am scared of the nausea that I often feel after eating. It happens though that I wake up in a panic attack and I have many episodes of crying. 

I would like to state that I have done many tests, including abdomen ultrasound, endoscopy, many many blood tests, and am currently waiting for a brain MRI, but thats in May. All tests done came out completely normal, except for slightly elevated ferritin that ultimately resolved itself.

Are these symptoms of benzo withdrawal? They do seem to come and go, though. Today I managed to eat a bowl of cereal and a sandwich for lunch. Have slight nausea. Yesterday I had no nausea in the evening but was very tired. Panic attacks though do seem to make the symptoms much much worse.

However, this was after finishing a taper completely, and still having fairly noticeable symptoms of withdrawal for a couple weeks.  


Finding myself in a similar situation again, I want to consider taking NAC combined with the taper, hoping to alleviate some of the discomfort resulting from the gradually declining dosages.    
I've also read and come to understand (I think), that NAC sort of... 'balances' out the neurochemicals in your brain, including GABA and Dopamine, and that cessation of withdrawal symptoms is due to this.    


What I'm wondering is, would taking NAC with the benzos make my withdrawal worse, as they're 'forcing' the GABA and such back to the CURRENT state of chemistry, or might it just stop me from 'feeling' the effects of the benzos, albeit still helping to manage negative withdrawal symptoms?",6

December 2020 was when I got Covid. It was mild to moderate.
January 2021 I started with all day long panic attacks. I was in and out of the ER, urgent care, my doctor, and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with PTSD, General anxiety disorder, ocd, intrusive thoughts, and major panic disorder. I was put on so many different ssri, tricyclics, etc. All of them giving me terrible side effects that would land me in the ER. So it is now in my chart I am allergic to all ssri, snri, and tricyclic medications. With that said, I have been on Ativan for 13 months now. .5mg, 3 times a day. I've never abused it, never ran out early, nothing. 
My pysch doctor told me there are no other meds to try. And now we have to taper off Ativan. She slashed my prescription from 90 a month to 60 a month. 
I am terrified. Not of withdrawals. But I do NOT want to be the person I was before. I don't want all day long panic attacks. Doomsday thoughts that won't leave my head, that play on repeat.

I barely get through the day on 20mg now and the tolerance withdrawals are getting worse. 

Should i taper or first go up and stabilise and then taper? Was thinking going up to 25mg for 5 days and taper 5 mg and then another 5mg. after that do 20% taper per week till i am off.

Also, have agmatine, memantine, fasoracetam, magnesium glycine NAC, little bit of l-theanine, Apigenin, xanax and pregabalin to help with taper.

1ste question is should i taper or go up and stabilise and 2nd how and what substances listed can i use to help with taper?

I was addicted to Valium for about 2 years, slowly building up from the occasional 2mg pill when needed as it said on my prescription (lol right) up to a total of 10-15mg daily towards the end. Far from the worst I've read about but bad enough for me.

Had to organize my own taper which was only ~3 weeks because my doctor suddenly without warning canceled my subscription and wouldn't hear anything about a taper, weird but what can you do.

The withdrawals hit like an absolute nuclear bomb and I had several panic attacks per day, burning skin, paranoia and the list goes on, won't bother to name them all but google ""Valium withdrawals"" and read the list I had most of them.

Withdrawals came and went in waves the next several months, sometimes easier than the previous waves, sometimes almost as bad as the first ones. It took a serious toll on my mental and physical health, constant headaches, chronic pain in joints etc. My girlfriend and mother of my child almost left me, and I was dysfunctional.

After a particularly hard wave hit around Easter 2021(8months after quitting) I broke down and got a doctor appointment and was started on Zoloft. The road since then has been bumpy I'm not going to lie, but for me it took away 95% of my anxiety. I went up to at most 150mg but it made me a zombie so I went down to 50mg which I'm at now.

I can say in my situation Zoloft saved my life. It gave me an instant break from anxiety and panic attacks which allowed me to function in society and start healing. I've been on Zoloft for 9 months now and I am almost back to myself before I started Valium, only with healthier ways to deal with problems coming my way.

This sounds like a commercial for Zoloft but it's hard for it not to, I had some side effects on it which most will experience like lessened libido for a while and a bit distant at times, but that's about it and they have decreases heavily in intensity compared now to them.

**In summary** I've gone from hopeless and suicidal to happy and active with greatly improved relations to friends and family, I'm working out, and I'm able to deal with challenges in my life in an effective way and with a positive mindset. There is hope! If you need medication discuss it with your doctor and consider starting. Chronic stress over extended period is toxic for the mind and body. Good luck everybody I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.",18

A psych put me on 1mg clonazepam 2 x a day for 5 years. A new PCP recently told me how it wasn't supposed to be long term, etc. So Aug 31 of 2021 we started weaning off of it. I had my last dose on November 30, 2021. My most noticeable symptom since stopping was the muscle spasms, tremors in my hands, some weakness in my legs and the wildest hot flashes.

However in the last 3 weeks, I've started having what I will describe as pre-migraine symptoms but without the headache. It starts with blurry vision, then I see specs of light and squiggles in my vision. Within a few minutes the tingling starts, my face, my tongue, my hands, my ears. My right ear feels like it has an ear bud in it 100% of the time and it's empty... I also feel like it's hard to speak coherently even if I can think normally during the episode. 

From the first episode, I went about a week before I had another one, and they've been getting more frequent. Today is Tuesday and in the last week I've had 3 - one on Wednesday, one on Sunday and again on Monday trying to drive home from work.  I had to pull over and have my husband come get me. Ended up at the ER to make sure it wasn't something terrible - CT scan clear, EKG clear, blood work clear. They basically said ""we don't know what's wrong, see Neurology in a week"". 

The episodes usually last about 30-45 minutes. The blurry vision is mostly gone now, but ever since yesterday I feel in a fog like I've taken a bunch of cold medicine. 

Has anyone experienced this before? I don't want to load up on a bunch of supplements or whatever and then not know what's helping and what's not. I'm so frustrated and feel like I'm losing my mind. It's affecting my work and the only thing that helps is sleep and that's only because I don't know what's happening when I'm sleeping...

Suggestions, stories, etc all welcomed with open arms.

I have been very emotional & irritable, and exhausted, and I’ve just about chewed my cheeks off with nervous biting. And my tinnitus is back 🙃 But that’s all been going on for weeks now; I don’t actually have any new or worse symptoms now that I’m off. That’s such a relief to me, and I’m feeling more hopeful than ever.

After tapering for so long, it almost felt anticlimactic when I jumped. But I am going to take the time to celebrate and be proud of myself, damn it! 

Thanks so much to everyone on this sub for your support, and for sharing your stories. I’ve probably read nearly every single one since last July, no joke. Sometimes I just needed to read your stories to stay sane, even when I wasn’t well enough to respond. I wish you all well, and will keep you posted on my post-taper journey!",35

I started klonopin about 3 years ago. I am now 24. I am autistic with an ADHD overlap, as well as having MDD and GAD. This might be kind of long so bear with me. I’m trying my best to make it short but there are a lot of details. Buspirone was the last thing I tried and it did absolutely nothing) I was tired of racing thoughts and intrusive thoughts 24/7 and not being able to fall asleep due to just laying in bed and repeating my thoughts and in different ways over and over. I was sick of not being able to socialize, talk over the phone and talking in person seemed impossible. So eventually my doctor prescribed me clonazepam. He warned me at first to make sure I understood that it was addictive. I said yes and that I was basically willing to give anything a try at that point. I later found out I didn’t actually know what I was getting into. He started me on 1mg once a day eventually increasing to “1mg twice a day” which I stuck to only for a little while before I started only taking once a day before bed and the other as needed. Over the past few years I’m not sure if what I did caused any of my symptoms to get worse. My medication pattern would always be completely off. I would take 1 every night but then I would try 1.5-2 a day for a little bit but not longer than a few days or a couple weeks before going back to 1 for a few months. I'm not sure why I did this, but I would always take less than prescribed and never more. Does anyone have any information on doing this? Anyway, fast forward and eventually I just fell into a major depressive episode loop. I have no idea what was going on. My doctor obviously had no clue what he was doing and I'll tell you why. I was eventually on about 7-8 different medications and I was on 3 anti depressants at once because I couldn't get my depression under control. Eventually he didn't want me on so many at once, and he switched me to Effexor. This blew me away, he had me ""stop"" 2 antidepressants at the same time after being on them for multiple years. Cold turkey, without telling me to taper off of them. I actually went psychotic about a week after abruptly stopping them. This episode lasted for about 3 days, and they were the worst 3 days of my life. I had terrifying hallucinations, hearing things that weren't there or coming up with the worst possible scenarios in my head about something bad that is happening and actually believed it. After a few days I didn't leave my room and tried to sleep as much as I could and didn't do anything drastic and eventually I calmed down and it went away. Somehow I managed to push through it. Eventually I went back to the doctor who was treating me since I was 4. I used to be on ADHD medication for 12 years. I got off of it all once when I was 16 before later on realizing I actually needed it. My old doctor that I'm now with again doesn't give both stimulants and depressants, so he wanted me to get off of the klonopin. I agreed and he got me down to just two medications. Thankfully at the time I was still only taking 1mg/day instead of the 2. I started tapering down by 0.25 every 7-10 days. At first I was having a lot of withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, panic, headaches, being extremely nauseous, stomach pains, my entire body ached and I felt weak and it was hard to get up and do anything which I can compare what it feels like when you have the flu. I was extremely irritable and had mood swings between depression and anger or feeling alright so I mostly tried to keep to myself. I was feeling extremely fatigued physically and mentally. I noticed that my sense of smell was a lot stronger and that I was really sensitive to sounds and that seemed to start about 2 days later and peaked about nearly a week later and lasted for a few days after. I was fighting through all of it and it was hell, but nothing like I had experienced with the antidepressants which I think gave me a bit of confidence that since I got off of those that I could get through anything. I didn't give in though, and continued telling myself that it would get better and found comfort in knowing that it was just withdrawal that would pass and that I would not be that way forever. The symptoms calmed down a little after a week so I was fairly confident. I reduced to 0.50, I seemed to be doing really well, and then it got bad again. Telling myself the same thing as last time, it helped a lot. Same thing happened, it got bad after seemingly doing great for a couple days and then a week in at 0.50 I started having severe insomnia. I was up for 60+ hours while laying in bed trying to fall asleep for about ~12 hours or longer, but I just couldn't. Tossing and turning and racing thoughts in my head. I had tried everything for sleep, but the one thing I refused to do was take more klonopin. This was the worst stage of my taper because along with all of the other symptoms I mentioned above, now I was suffering from sleep deprivation too. It's weird how this works, but the only way I could fall asleep was when I took my ADHD medication after waiting for the next day and I fell asleep for a few hours. It wasn't much, but it was something. I had came up with the theory that a lot of my anxiety originally is actually caused by my untreated ADHD. When the stimulant is in my system, I don't notice my racing thoughts at all. It seemed to calm me down enough to be able to fall asleep. After doing this for awhile, the insomnia seemed to really improve as I got further into my taper. I started being able to sleep again even though it was difficult and I would wake up a lot throughout the night but I tried to grab as much shut eye as I could. About 10 days later on 0.50mg, I finally felt ""okay"" enough to bring it down a little bit more. I'm generally really impatient, and I was determined to be done. Same thing happened with the 0.25 dose, besides the insomnia didn't really come back. Of course I still had difficult anxiety to deal with and all of the symptoms I mentioned before but I knew in my mind that it was going to pass once again and that I would be okay. Each taper seemed to go the same way. This time is when a lot of the symptoms really started to die down when it came to them getting worse a week or so later. They weren't as severe as the first or second week, but still bothersome but eventually they seemed to all go away completely except for my increased anxiety, irritability and mood swings. 3 days ago I took my last 0.25 before stopping entirely, and I'm just so happy that I am finally off of it for good. It feels like a really great accomplishment. I am doing much better now although bad anxiety is the most of my worries at the moment. It has only been 3 days, but I also feel really fatigued after only being awake for a few hours. Does anyone have an idea if and when this will go away? I just don't want to feel exhausted all of the time. Thank you for reading, it's way longer than I meant it to be but please, if you're going through anything I am more than happy to answer any questions and I would love to be able to help others through my own experience.

I read an amazing memoir by a danish poet/author who went through an opioid addiction in the 50s/60s.

I’ve never been through addiction for that, but was really amazed by the book. It wasn’t hampered by a lot of the contemporary, zeitgeist stuff that comes along with a lot of addiction writing. 

It was very lyrical and personal. 

I just want to talk about this book tbh.

I'm down to .25mg so almost there and it's definitely been awful.. 24/7 anxiety, akathisia, unable to focus, insomnia, heart palpitations, tinnitus, DP/DR, feeling so disoriented and completely out of it all the time with brief moments of rest, or ""windows"".. Ironically, I actually feel better when I wake up, and slowly feel worse in the evening which I feel is counter to many people.

From the start of February 2019, to about a year n like 2 months after, I had two deeply close friends pass from an Overdose. One was the guy I actually have his first ever xan when we were dumbass 15 y/os, we thought they were a miracle pill. Died from mixing too much heroin and xans. Other buddy died from xans and alcohol (I presume, only heard about the benzos). This one had serious schizophrenia and psychotic problems. We had plans made a week before he passed, and the last thing I heard from was ""InfoBlue, help! The aliens. They're coming after me! Please for the love of God!"" Or something along those lines. I loved him. At one point I was extremely into an alternative religious mindset, and since we agreed on our views, I considered him my spiritual prodigy. 

Before this year, I had never had to deal with the death of anyone close to me, so with not only those in the same year, but my grandfather as well, that was it for me. It started with other stuff, but soon became benzos. This went on for 3 months, and I got kicked out after. Got sober again after. And had been doing really well since, but now I've been in a relapse for the past 2 months or so. I feel like it's become to much more difficult to stop. I overdosed myself twice in the past two weeks. Completely unintentionally. First time was because of being black out, compulsively redosing, and on like a gram worth of the edibles. I had to go to a withdrawal clinic for two weeks after. Then, not three days ago, I overdose on O-PCE. Go into a dissociative psychosis, and couldn't possibly describe the things I saw and experienced. One of the only things I remember, is my step father cradling me, and as it was the first time I was starting to come to, I couldn't stop crying and thanking him. I've put both him and my mom through so much. I don't know why they keep supporting me through this. It's been going on for 7 years. They said I need to start making progression to stop, which I have. I've admitted to a very lengthy out-patient program, as well as going to start trauma counseling. As that's where I believe my main issues reside. 

But as it stands now, I feel like it's possible to not use bars. The cravings are insanity, and they took my gabapentin of 200mg a day + my divalproex that was supposed to be a taper down. They didn't give them back, so I'm definitely in withdrawal for those. Probably contributing, but

She gave them to me whenever I was nervous, or cried for some reason yadadada, and soon enough I realized that being high on diazepan felt fucking good.
I don't know if she did It out of malice but I do know she was an unstable pill popping mess, so I don't know if she thought it would legit help me, or if she just didn't want to deal with my emotional crisis and wanted me to shut up. She saw me all retarded multiple times, rambling about whatever, and sometimes even breaking down crying for reasons I can't even remember, so I don't know why she would keep giving them to me.
I'm almost 22 now, and I've been taking them on and off for years.
The off phases were when i realized I was building tolerance and didn't get the high that I wanted, and when I started to feel like it was frying my brain and leaving me lethargic during the day, and sometimes it made overthink so much my mind was exhausted.
The on parts were because I always came back to it, to feel good and listen to some music, maybe (attempt to) write something, and also when I had meltdowns for reasons I was yet to discover, anxiety attacks, when I had fights with an unstable mother who was not prepared to handle another teenager.",6

Any Advice on How to Heal Properly?,"I've been trying to kick Xanax for about 5 weeks now. I've also been trying to kick fentanyl as well, but haven't made that jump (again) yet.  Long story made short, I was using approx. 4mg of Xanax intranasally for about 2 years. I had prior use, on and off, for years and never had a problem getting on or off them. However, this time has been drastically different.  I've been experiencing every withdrawal symptom imaginable and some that I've never even thought possible (for example---EXTREME sensitivity for all of my senses).  I tried to jump off the 4mg of daily Xanax by using 0.5mg the first day, 0.25mg for each days 2 and 3 and then stopped. I made it through a grueling few days of hell without Xanax or fent before I went backwards and did both for several days. I then continued the fent, but stopped the Xanax for 14 days before I tried to stop the fent again and only made it about 30 hours before I picked up both again.....and began using Xanax orally after the initial jump....

I stopped the Xanax again after doing both for about 3 or 4 days.  I then only took 0.5mg of Xanax orally for one day and 0.5mg about 3 days later. I haven't done any Xanax since February 10th and I still feel like hell. Despite what I've read, I genuinely think my body kind of NEEDED the benzos--- I was beyond empty--not eating, drinking or sleeping and having MAJOR convulsions, etc...I still don't feel well, but I'm slightly better than I was. 

For context, I have other medical issues at play on top of withdrawal...I've always had hyperthyroidism and developed a mass on my thyroid that has skewed my endocrine system pretty drastically so now my body is hypo after decades of being hyper. I'm still trying to figure out next treatments because I have a lot of factors at play... but when I went to the new doctor on Feb. 8th, the nurse saw that my heart rate was really high and my blood pressure was really high as well... I'm assuming this is from the benzo withdrawal, but she prescribed a beta blocker and visteral.  I have not started the beta blockers out of fear, but have taken 3 visteral.  There are a host of other medical issues as well, but i don't think they are relevant. 

I have a ton of meds I've been hoarding to try to successfully get off both the Xanax and fent, but I've read mixed things about almost all of them. Tonight, I took 400mg of gabapentin and it completely weirded out my entire system to the point I was having cognitive issues and my vision was affected heavily.... has anyone else had weird issues with gabapentin?  

I apologize because I can't articulate what I'm thinking because my brain feels like mush and it's extremely scary and frustrating that I can't even explain what I'm feeling or thinking because everything feels so weird and unreal...although I do have brief moments of semi-clarity mixed in.... 

Anyway, I'm making the final jump off of fent really soon and going to methadone because I need to get out of this vicious cycle. I saved a little Xanax to attempt to make the transition....and a ton of other meds. I'm just curious if anyone else had issues with the gabapentin and if anyone had any advice on how to actually repair the damage I've done because I am barely functioning without the benzos and am TERRIFIED about what is going to happen when I try for the 4th time to quit the fent while still going through benzo withdrawal. 

In case anyone has advice, these are the meds I have: approx. 120mg of methadone, a limited amount of Xanax, a bunch of 800mg gabapentin, about 40 of the 0.1 mg of clonidine, about 60 visteral, 30 of the beta blocker (proponal, I think), about 1 tablespoon of kratom, about 50 ambien, 20 imodium and a couple of vials of intramuscular benadryl....",2

About a month ago, I tried to cold turkey Remeron because I had had enough, and 3-4 days in, I developed severe pacing akathisia and psychological torment beyond anything I have experienced this far.

After reinstating, I have become completely hopeless and devasted and see no way out of this besides ending my life. I have contemplated this for a couple of years. I walk around stuck in my mind, and absolutely nothing distracts me.  

I realize I am much different than most on this subreddit. I only know if two other people like me are out there. All the others are dead because it was not survivable. 

I honestly want to leave this shitty existence.",5

I (24f) since I was 16 years old have struggled with getting to sleep and staying asleep for longer than 2-3 hours. There are some days/weeks that are good and I sleep well and then I am back to this. At 16 I started self-medicating to help me sleep and I would take literally anything that had a sedative in it: anti-allergies, painkillers, cough syrups. I would never take more than the prescribed amount but I would still take them regularly. 
I would stop in the middle when I had moments of panic about what I was doing and then I’d go back to it.
When I went to university, I start taking clonazepam almost regularly and if I couldn’t get that I would take lexotinal. It really ducked me up and I had a breakdown at one point where I confessed to friends that I felt like an addict, and I abused prescription pills. 
I have worked really hard on stopping this and have mostly not succumbed except for short periods or where my mental state has been in a place where I need something to put me to sleep. At times I don’t even know if the medicine will help me sleep, I just want to take it and hope that it does. 

However, sometimes I’ll see these medicines around or develop random cravings to take them despite not experiencing any issues. 
I recently started taking levosulpiride again which a doctor had recommended to me sometime ago but the prescription had ended. There’s no reason for me to have started it except that I have had a few bad nights despite having ample time to make up for the lost sleep but I saw the pack and I couldn’t help it and I noticed how all day today all I could think of was planning how to get more once I ran out. I don’t think this is even about getting to sleep anymore.

Is this an addiction?",3

Hello. I’m writing on behalf of my daughter. She’s 2yr old (28mo) non-verbal and has been on clobazam (onfi) since she was 10mo old in order to control seizures from epilepsy.  Since May of 2021 when she was 18/19mo old she started showing odd behavior… just seemed to be very loopy. we realized she had extremely high blood levels for clobazam. So we started to taper and realized how difficult it is. We are not even halfway down the dose she was taking in May.


Cutting to the chase, I need to know what she’s possibly feeling in order to help here. 

What do benzos feel like when you take them? 
And what does the side effects feel like? And what does the withdrawals feel like? 
How long do withdrawals last?
Can congitive function improve after using benzos for 2+years?

I slowly tapered myself down to half of my daily dose then sought professional help 4-5 months ago.

To mitigate the worst, I was given gabapentin (“gabaP”) and no guidance. gabaP did help, but after a year of PAWS it became clear that a) I should have ended use of gabaP long before and b) it was dragging out the benzo PAWS.

Never went above 300 mg/day of GabaP but I know it can have its own nasty WD, so I started liquid tapering last Sep. Dropped 0.3 ml every week that I wasn’t in a benzo wave. Got into a steady routine after Xmas of dropping by 0.3 ml every Fri, feeling like shit on Sat, grinding thru Sun, then feeling tolerably miserable thru the next Fri - unless the rare benzo wave had hit.

That was the pattern until last Fri, when I dropped down to 1.2 ml. Sat was oddly ok (5/10), then Sun hit like a brick and I was a pathetic mess curled up in bed all day (2-3/10). Mon I dragged myself to my internship and class, barely (3-4/10). Tue, again a wreck in bed all day with sweats, shakes, alienation and DP/DR, headache, intrusive thoughts, panic, etc (2-3/10). Wed, again terrible but made it to work/class, (3-4/10). Yesterday ended as a 2/10 + depression. Not sure if it’s a benzo wave or I’ve crossed a gabaP taper point too fast but I didn’t drop today - just feeling too intensely alienated, agitated, and defeated.

I planned to end the taper mid-March, before spring break. Now I think it may be better to slow down and end gabaP taper after graduating in May. Then what? I’m looking at an unknown frontier and my new psychiatrist, who does care, has little advice. Am I facing months of benzo recovery this summer? Is benzo recovery still active now, or stalled til gabaP is gone? 
I just don’t understand how it works.

I'm wanting to stop taking diazepam. I've been on it as a daily medication for about 5 years due to panic disorder and PTSD, but I've become a lot healthier in general over the last 12 months. Diazepam is kind of like the last leftover part of my old unhealthy and anxious life, and I'm ready to try to remove it from my life entirely.   


I was taking 5mg once per day for about 4-5 years. In the last few weeks I've gone down to 3mg per day, and I feel a bit more anxious overall. I get an upset stomach occasionally, headaches sometimes, but really nothing that interferes with my daily life. Occasionally I'll take an extra 1mg at night if my anxiety gets really bad, but I try to avoid it.   


I understand I'm on a very low dose. Do you think I should be alright to taper over the next two months or so? Perhaps another month at 3mg, then a month at 2mg, then a month at 1mg, and then jump?   


I'll be honest. My doctor isn't much help at all. They've been fairly useless with the whole thing and suggested I should just stop my 5mg dose straight away and that's it. I wasn't really comfortable doing that after what I know about withdrawal.   


Luckily I'm in a place in my life where my mental and physical health is really quite good. I can work from home most days, and maintain a relaxed lifestyle to assist me with any withdrawal symptoms. I'm happy to deal with some uncomfortable physical and mental withdrawal symptoms. I know it won't be lots of fun. I just want to make sure that I'm not doing anything too dangerous. Or maybe I'm at such a low dose that I'm worried about nothing? Any advice would be great. Thanks!",2

Physical symptoms 90% stopped around 2-3 week mark (apart from body getting tight randomly and having a few shocks to arms every so often) but mental symptoms seemed to get worse

I’ve felt a lot better overall in the last couple of weeks but I just got my wisdom tooth taken out a few days ago and I’ve felt really bad the last 3 days. My main problem is the overwhelming anxiety about everything and overthinking everything. I feel like I am dying basically every second of the day and I also know its all in my head

I keep overthinking everything and the only thing that helps. Me is weed. I feel trapped in my own head and I just keep feeling so much self hatred. I don't trust myself as much and i think its because of the anxiety. 

I don’t know if anyone will relate to this or if it’s withdrawal symptom or just because I am anxious so much lately because of my wisdom tooth extraction

I’ve been terrified the last few days of getting dry socket or infection so haven’t been eating as good. I noticed when I was feeling extremely anxious from withdrawals I couldn’t eat much either and weed was the only thing that helped then

I really hate feeling like I have to take something (weed) to feel better but I’ve also seen posts of some of you guys not enjoying things for months, I am not sure if it’s okay for me to smoke weed but I do feel guilty and just sad and anxious all the time. Weed makes it easier for me to enjoy things and can slow the thoughts down but doesn't stop them 

The last couple of weeks I’ve gotten a lot of my life back slowly but 
surely and now I feel like I’m in a pit again, and I just keep making it worse talking to myself in my head and overthinking

My overall cognitive ability feels like its at about 75% still, hoping that improves with time also. It has been about 40 days since I jumped",3

I’ve never been addicted to benzos before. Please help.","*Edit: These are pressed pills. I don’t actually know if they’re the dose they say they are. They’re “green hulk 3.5 mg.” My doctor is a psychiatrist. He told me “I can’t continue seeing you while you’re taking non-prescribed narcotics so we need to get you off of this fast.”

Opiates have always been my issue. I’ve been struggling with heroin addiction for 10 years and have been to many treatment centers, achieving recovery for brief periods and long periods at times. Just when I thought I had kicked my opiate addiction for good, I decided to dabble in Xanax that a coworker offered to me. 

It’s gotten out of control. Sometimes I would take up to 6 mg a day. Sometimes 3 mg. But 4 is my average and I was honest with my physiatrist. 

He put me on lamictal (never thought I was bipolar but answered a series of questions and he thinks I have bipolarity; dad’s bipolar 1, runs in family). This drug has helped both my parents tremendously and I’m hoping it’ll help me too. 

The problem is he wants me to titrate down 1 mg every 3 days. A fast taper. The first option he gave me: go to detox and rehab. I can’t do that. I have a great job and was just accepted into an amazing grad program. 

I’m being dishonest with my friends in recovery. I go to meetings all of the time. I’m functional, just can’t keep lying and living like this. My tolerance keeps getting higher and I don’t want to be addicted anymore. 

I feel his taper is way too short and I’m really going to suffer, but part of me just wants to kick it as fast as possible. I tried to taper a month ago in 7 days and had a partial seizure after day 2. I was conscious but fell on the ground shaking. 

I don’t want to suffer and drag this out, but 1 mg every three days? That’s less than two weeks. I’ve never been too anxious of a person but ironically feel that Xanax has made me MORE anxious. Between doses. When I try to quit. I’m now realizing I actually always DID have anxiety that manifested in overthinking, overanalyzing, and over-intellectualizing everything.  

I don’t know who else to turn to because if I’m honest with my recovery support system, I lose trust and feel like a fraud. Any help is appreciated.",6

He rang back this morning to get all my details, as with most UK services they're understaffed and overbooked so the soonest I can see a medic is Wednesday. I have about 100 tabs in blister packs that were sold to me as diazepam but definitely aren't, I suspect they're flualprazolam, they taste like alprazolam (I chewed my last diazepam tablet and chewed one of these the compare the difference, wouldn't recommend, alpra in particular tastes fucking grim). Slight tangent there, anyway I can last until Wednesday without going into withdrawal so not worried on that front, just have a headache from switching benzos.

Now I am worried maybe I am addicted or will have long term symptoms if I quit.

I am not sure, but I thought I noticed some brain fog moments where concentrating seems hard, I can't say that is when I don't have a dose fo ra while or not.

What should I look for and should I get off this even if it helps me sleep. Sometimes I don't sleep all night, or two nights in a row and this saves me. 

I am conflicted as I didn't. realize how bad this could be until I see you guys on here.

I've had no medical history before that, nor any addictions. 

After 8 days on 8 mg, I tapered to 6 mg (4 x 1,5mg) and hold that for 12 days. That was - for me - a brutal experience. Since then I could convince my psychiatrist to slowly convert me to Valium (diazepam). But he won't follow Ashton who said that 1mg Xanax equals 20 mg Valium. All officials in my country say it's 1mg Xanax equals 10mg Valium... My personal experience is that it must be somewhere in the middle. 

This weekend I'll be converted completely to Valium at a remaining 34mg.  So that's from 8 mg Xanax to 34 mg Valium in less than 7 weeks total usage. 

**My question is:** With Xanax you feel the next day already that you are tapering too fast or not. But Valium has a far longer half life. Now, since I'm not on benzos that long (less than 2 months) but started at an insane dosage, I don't want to drag out my taper too long. My side effects are OK , and when I start to suffer from insomnia I have other methods to put me to sleep.   
So, with Valium, say I make a -hypothetical- 25% drop from 34 mg to 25mg. After how many days will I feel if that was too much or not? I see many people making small drops every 2 weeks or even longer, but that will prolong my taper and I don't want that. 

Extra info: I metabolize very fast. With Xanax it stopped working after 3.5-4 hours already. When I did psychedelics in the past, I was ""sober"" long before others. 

Is it ok with Valium to try a drop every 5 days and feel if you're going too fast or not? 

Thanks",1

I know many benzo’ers feel their life is passing them by, but as long as the agony persists, it is *so* peaceful to watch one of his documentaries. It’s slow, you don’t need a loy of brain RAM, and it reminds you what a wonderful planet we inhabit, and that there is so much beauty to keep fighting for, so many experiences to be had. It not only relieves short-term agony, but it also *hugely* motivates attaining a life ‘beyond benzos’! (3 months into my taper, I have to admit, motivation is getting a bit challenged due to duration). Even in the worst of withdrawal (idk I surely never experienced that…), we can still see the Wonders of the World! Life doesn’t have to pass by us because our bodies (and minds) are in agony, there is still so much beauty to learn about, even from a sick bed! Sure, we’re having a hard time appreciating it compared to before, but we *need to be reminded* of the feelings we used to have when watching this stuff (or better yet, getting into nature) before the benzos took hold. Life had beauty then! It is still there! And it’s even accessible from the couch, even if you’re shaking and trembling counting the hours to your next dose (allowed by the taper). To me it made an enormous impact and gave a jolt of vitality into seeing the taper through. 

If nothing else, that might just extend the time tilll our next dose by an hour, which is progress ;)",7

It didn’t help and I had no idea that I became dependent on it. I tapered off .5 2X day for 3 weeks then .25 2X day 3 weeks. The first week of each taper was horrible, agoraphobia, anxiety, ect. I was supposed to take .25 1x day for another three weeks but I only took it for 4 days and jumped on 1/7/22. I expected to have a rough first week and gradually get better.

I’ve had so many other symptoms including poor sleep, dizziness when I stand up, my brain feels like an engine running, headaches, tinnitus, internal tremor, tummy issues, body temp. Issues, irritability, sound sensitivity, sugar and caffeine sensitivity, muscle twitches, blurry vision, restlessness, night sweats, dry eyes, rapid heart beat, intrusive thoughts, and rumination. So today is day 32 and I think I’m in a wave? My question is how long is acute withdrawal? Am I in protracted withdrawal? I thought since I was not on it for that long that I would recover quicker.

I managed to go way way down to like 10mg Valium which I know is still a lot but I was happy I was controlling it and I was still working on going even more down.

I got a new batch and something triggered me so I said “fuck it, what’s one night getting mad fucked” I took about 60mg Valium, and ended up doing this for probably 4 weeks. Honestly It’s a blur could be a little more time or a little less.

I’m so disappointed in myself I was so close to quitting this shit; I was getting ready to quit my suboxone too. But now I have to start all over again.

I’m a failure. However I’m grateful for my best friend and my family who where extremely supportive when I told them. Yes they where sad and a bit disappointed but they helped me make a plan again and said they’ll help notíciate me and act as a sort of sponsor.

I’m so grateful I have people like this. But I’m terrified that I’ll loose them if I keep fucking up. I lied to them for almost a month before I told them the truth.

These experiences were harder with klonopin than other benzos like Xanax or Valium even. Yes the discomfort was still there but nothing compared to the crippling depersonalising feeling of klonopin..
My suspicions were reaffirmed after reading the Ashton manual yesterday. I’m not alone; there have been anecdotal experiences of klonopin inducing dpdr than other benzos out there. Something to do with its MOA.

The rebound anxiety was brutal and I work with people daily. I believe 2 things helped me immensely: Time, and psychedelic therapy. Hear me out..Ketamine infusion therapy is already legal is many states. Mushrooms, lsd, DMT are all proven to help in similar ways to ketamine, and they promote neurogenesis and strengthen the connection between neurons. For a while, I had anxiety, brain fog, and I felt like I was on a cognitive decline. Taking both macrodoses and microdoses helped me so much..I'd say 80% improvement. I am hoping with more time and more treatment, I will get to 100%. There is a ton of positive research behind these medicines if you look on Reddit and Google. Also I am about to go on a 10 day silent meditation retreat which I think should help me even more. It is completely free and they are a global organization with locations all over the world. They run on donations. Check out [Dhamma.org](https://Dhamma.org). I wouldn't recommend going there while on serious withdrawal.

Btw are there any supplements anyone recommends to help with brain and cognitive recovery from long-term use of benzos?

I’m healthy and I’ve felt 100% back to normal for a long time now, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.  

Guys, you *will* feel normal some day. And the long term effects are totally manageable and you can still live a totally full and beautiful life after benzo withdrawal. I know it seems like you’ll never be normal again, but your brain is trying it’s very best to heal and it *will* succeed. If you needed a sign to get you through this right now, this is it ❤️",24

Took clonazepam, lorazepam then alprazolam (diazepam too, but that was for tapering.) Basically went to 3mg alprazolam and stayed there for several years. It did work well at the beginning, and then after several years I noticed I was unwell. I had agoraphobia which was new for me, amnesia and a general feeling of being in a fog. There was a problematic refill that I missed and I ended up having a seizure, which was pretty scary to say the least.


I think a seizure was a point where I thought that tapering and discontinuation were in my best interests. I also discovered the Ashton manual protocol and the descriptions of adverse effects aligning with what I experienced. Ultimately I decided that I wanted to at least reduce my use and try to taper to zero. By and large my shrink was on board with a taper at my own pace and crossover to diazepam. A multi year process of gradual reductions to zero ensued.


tl;dr I tapered and discontinued benzodiazepines after about a decade total of use. Feeling worse off in the long run compelled me to stop, so self interest was largely the reason for me.",6

My use was intermittent, dozing about once a month or every other month depending on my mental state. The doses were pretty high due to the fact that I naturally had a high tolerance and it grew quickly, so my usual dose would be around 50-70 mg (also I never re-dosed). Last time I took diazepam was for new years eve and I only took around 20 mg as my kiss goodbye dose. Yesterday I started having all the symptoms of a diazepam withdrawal (except seasures, and I didn't throw up yet but I have really bad nausea). Now I'm wondering if this could possibly be an actual withdrawal because it's been two months since I cold turkeyed and I highly doubt that I had a physical dependence but I'm pretty sure I had a mental dependence. Lastly, the reason why I used to take them was because I was self medicating my depersonalization and derealization disorder as I never actually got any help from my psychologists and psychiatrists.

i would usually get research chemicals like, clonazolam, flualprazolam, and etizolam.  i only do these RC’s once every week-2 weeks, but i’ve noticed that even after taking two weeks off, my memory is still very bad. 

it didn’t used to be this bad and i would usually recover a few days after a binge, but now i’m concerned that i’ve caused permanent damage, because i forget everything and lately i’m having these little “black outs” where i did something, like take a shower for example, and later on in the day i can’t remember if i actually did and have zero recollection of even doing it that day. 

i guess i’m wondering if anyone else experienced this severe memory loss from binge use off and on and if so, how long did it take to fully recover? 

i’m also very foggy when it comes to conversation, i used to be able to think very clearly and words would come to my brain effortlessly when i was trying to explain something, but now it seems like i just cannot think sometimes and i end up saying things like, “what was i saying?” or “something like that...”

i hate it and i want to heal fully, but i also have this desire to keep taking the benzos, even though i’m not physically addicted, i very much am mentally and struggle to resist taking any benzos once it’s been a week or two.

I experienced this as well.

I stopped taking the charcoal and after a day or two I felt better. 

Anyways my question is if anyone has used charcoal to speed up the withdrawal and hopefully have it end quicker. 

The first time I wasn’t expecting or ready mentally for the withdrawal. I know it will feel horrible but would it shorten the duration of withdrawal even if it made it more intense for a period of time?

Best thing to do if you’ve been in tolerance wd long term?,"11 years or so of near daily benzo use. First half of that 1-2 mg of Xanax. Second half 1-2 mg kpin. 

Anyone here whose been on these drugs long term and still taking them
Experience among other symptoms of worsening anxiety, unrelenting severe muscular stiffness and rigidity? I’m talking like so bad it causes chronic shortness of breath.

Also, if someone’s been in tolerance WD long term, and I don’t and won’t increase the dose altho part of me wants to briefly just to see if symptoms get better so I know for sure, I guess the only thing to do to even attempt to start to get better is begin a taper? I mean if symptoms are horrible on the Drug, I see no point in remaining on it and prolonging suffering so I guess beginning a slow taper would be best. Also considering a detox as I mentioned in another post but kinda worried about the effects of coming off such long term use so fast.

My doctor is something of an idiot when it comes to benzos. He doesn’t think they’re a big deal, doesn’t necessarily think they’re good long term but doesn’t think they can cause the symptoms I’m experiencing. He’s nonchalant about everything though so I don’t put much stock into anything he says to be honest. He thinks if my anxiety is as horrible as I say it is now, tapering now would be a mistake. I try to tell him it’s possible it’s so bad because of how long I’ve been on these Fkn meds even if the dose isn’t huge, but he doesn’t get it. When I began seeing him I had been on Xanax already for 5 years or so yet I never experienced the symptoms I am now after 6 years of klonopin (yet supposedly Xanax is the worst of them?) I suppose that could be because with Xanax at least your receptors and brain get a break from the benzo some of the time because it’s short acting so maybe less downregulation. With kpin or Valium, your brain is on benzos 24/7 basically.

Anyways, thanks for any insight.",4

My primary med was/is Methylphenidate (Ritalin). Although the medication worked, within about 90 minutes of taking it, a ‘storm’ would set off in my mind and I’d become hyper-anxious.

Amphetamines were even worse, so obviously that was a no-go zone.

Atomoxetine was easier to tolerate, but grossly exacerbated depression to the point of feeling suicidal.

So ultimately I had to settle for Methylphenidate as the ‘best of the worst’ if you will, and then try and find another med to stop the impending anxiety bomb.
Propranolol didn’t help, nor did Buspirone, nor Mirtazapine, nor SSRIs.

So in the end I made my deal with the devil and begun Xanax 0.5mg with each Ritalin dose (max 2mg per day). Good thing is that I finally found a med that resolves the stimulant side effects completely, and even better: it’s efficacy has remained the same in the 12 months since I started it. I’ve never had to elevate the dose at all.

The bad news is that if ever I go a day without taking any Xanax, I’m practically signing my own death warrant for the next day and onwards: excruciating pain unlike ANHTHING I’ve ever felt before in my life. Just 24 hours without Xanax = the devil invading my body and causing absolute havoc. The pain is so severe that I would literally do anything to get my hands on Xanax pills again to finally ‘put out the fire’.

So, even though a stable dose of 2mg ofXanax per day continues to be completely effective, with no detrimental side effects, I do not want there to come a day where, for whatever reason, I don’t have access to my Xanax pills - and then suffer the terrible consequences.

So I ask you folks: is there a sensible, reliable way of weaning off this medication and onto a similar medication that isn’t so quick to cause withdrawals?",3

What else can I do?,"I took 3 mg of Ativan per day for a few months. It took me months to taper off. From start to finish it was nearly a year.

I was off Ativan for three months before I had what was probably the strangest, most intense anxiety attack of my life. That day I had to take 2 mg of Ativan to deal with it. I felt weird the day after so I had to take 1.5 mg the day after. And I still needed it the day after that. I knew it immediately -- I'm back in the benzo trap.

That intense anxiety attack happened 3.5 months ago. I peaked at 2 mg/day for the first month after that. Then I went down to 1.5 mg/day, which I stayed at for over two months.

Three weeks ago I began my taper. I stopped taking Ativan during the day and only took 1.5 mg at night. Two weeks ago I started reducing the dose by 0.25 mg per week.

Today I'm taking 0.75 mg/day only at night, and I'm going down by 0.25 mg every three days, which seems very aggressive. But I feel mostly fine right now.

Here's what I'm doing every single day to manage the withdrawal:

* Reduced caffeine from 600 mg/day to a steady 400 mg/day

* Daily exercise until I burn myself out. I'm walking literally 10+ miles a day. I do a short workout with weights if I have the energy

* 50 mg trazodone at night to prevent insomnia, which seems to be helping

* Meditate for 10+ minutes most days

* Reducing stimulation with noise-canceling headphones


Honestly I think the exercise is the most important thing. What else can I do to make this manageable? Thanks.",4
2022-02-05 14:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/slf76f/finding_a_real_solution_for_benzodiazepine/,Finding A Real Solution For Benzodiazepine Dependence & Withdrawal,"Hi Everyone,

I am currently going through yet another hellish nightmare experience that is benzodiazepine tapering & withdrawal from Rivotril (Clonazepam, Klonopin). I had been on 2mg Clonazepam daily for the last seven years, until I began my taper two and a half months ago. I am now down to 1mg per day of Clonazepam and am holding due to severe withdrawal side effects and not stabilising well enough yet to continue with any further reductions.

I was originally prescribed Xanax (alprazolam) by a psychiatrist over ten years ago for anxiety & panic disorder, at which point he told me that I ""may need to stay on this medication for the rest of my life"". I had absolutely no idea at that stage what hell on earth would be waiting for me three years later when I would first experience being withdrawn cold-turkey by a hospital from the 4mg of Xanax daily that I had been prescribed.

I lasted six months after that utterly cruel, mean and likely illegal cold-turkey withdrawal from Xanax, experiencing some of the most horrid and painful symptoms that I had no idea the human body could even endure before I called a friend of mine and told her that I was either going to reinstate the benzodiazepines, or end my life. Fortunately, I reinstated, over the alternative.

I have spent a great deal of time and money researching every possible medical publication trying to find a solution to this problem. I've tried every supplement, medication, drug, chemical, therapy to try to either ease or speed up the withdrawal and healing process, but nothing worked beyond very minor and fairly insignificant impacts on the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and the accompanying symptoms.

In spite of that I refuse to believe that there isn't a solution to this problem that has crippled and debilitated me, and from what I've read over the years, has done the same to you and many others in the same or very similar situation to me. I believe that this problem, much like the opioid epidemic that has been making headlines around the world over recent years and months, is the fault of the very same pharmaceutical companies, governments, doctors, pharmacies etc.. and that they have the same responsibility to find a solution to this problem, our problem, as they are being demanded to with regards to solving the opioid crisis.

I have decided to approach the main pharmaceutical companies directly responsible for creating the benzodiazepines that I, and all of you, are suffering in absolute hell and torment from, and requesting that instead of launching a class action lawsuit on an international front (which I know we have both a case, and the numbers, to make good on that threat) that they instead work together with us, those who are suffering from seemingly endless withdrawal symptoms, impossibily long tapering timeframes, protracted withdrawal syndrome and all the other problems these drugs have caused us.. to collaborate and find a real, scientifically proven, medical solution to the very real and serious problem of benzodiazepine withdrawal.

I would like to know how many of you would be interested in working together to approach these companies in the spirit of collaborating with them to find a solution, rather than going down the path of class action litigation. I don't know about the rest of you, but money means absolutely nothing to me if I am to remain in this wretched physical state that these drugs have left me in, with a prospect of many years spent trying to heal from the untreated damage they have caused me.

If there is enough interest, then I would organise and create an official group/non-profit organisation from which we can independently manage and communicate with the pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories, universities and any other educational and private sector organisations that I can get involved in finding a solution to this issue. I see this as no different from finding a cure for any other major currently untreatable or incurable disease or disorder. 

I personally believe that benzodiazepines are the next major drug epidemic laying in wait, but so much more severe in impact and scale than what we have just witnessed with the opioid crisis. It is my intention to try to work with the pharmaceutical industry to try to solve this crisis before it explodes into a full blown media circus when the public finally realises the gravity of how far down the rabbit hole the world has gone with benzodiazepines.

Thank you for reading this far,

I’ve posted here before freaking out about my taper. I was talking about 1.25 alprazolam, cut into .25 3x a day and then .5 at bed time. This has been the case for a few years.

I tried switching to Valium and my body did not react well.

The past few days, I managed to keep my dose at .5 (.25 twice a day). I’ve been falling asleep without it, too.

I basically went from 1.25 -> .75 -> .5 over the span of a couple months. My doctor is aware that I am trying to reach less as the antidepressant I’m taking starts to kick in.

If I keep cutting .25 after a few weeks, what are my odds of having a seizure at all? Has anyone been in a similar boat/taper? I’m trying to be intuitive with this but also not make massive cuts.

Thank you",1

I can almost remember what it felt like to wake up every day not having to take a pill to feel normal.

My mother retired a bit over a year ago. Retirement has left her with far too much time, and not enough ways to fill that time. As a result, she developed severe anxiety. Her doctor prescribed her Clonazepam, and she has now been on it for about 10 months. 

Currently, her dose is .5 MG, twice daily. She has also been prescribed Zolpidem(10MG daily) for insomnia by a separate psychiatrist(her primary prescribes the Clonazepam). We just about have her off the Zolpidem and are looking to start a taper for the Clonazepam. 

Unfortunately, she is also on several other medications that convolute the situation. She was previously on Pregabalin and Gabapentin at separate times. She is currently on Lamotrigine as a replacement for those. I understand that all of those can impact pain, seizure threshold, and anxiety. 

She is on Escitalopram(ssri), and olanzapine(anti-psychotic). The olanzapine was meant to help with her anxiety, but I think it has more negative than positive effects. She has only been on anti-psychotics for about 10 months, so the goal is to taper her off of the Olanzapine after tapering her off the Clonazepam. She has been on SSRIs for a long time, and I'm not even thinking about touching those right now. 

Lastly, she is on Tamoxifen(selective estrogen blocker). This impacts her mood and overall function negatively, but there isn't really much that can be done about it. She had breast cancer years ago, and Tamoxifen is meant to prevent it from coming back. 

Right now she is completely couch-locked all day. Her cocktail of meds is extremely sedating, and she absolutely needs to come off of at least a few of them. Her cognition is totally shot. She does not have hobbies. She does not have preferences or opinions about anything. She is depressed and talks about suicide. She is unable to learn new things or really do anything. This is the worst I've ever seen her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've looked at some of the other taper schedules, so I have an idea of what to aim for, but I was hoping for some specific advice since my mother's dose seems to be a little lower than what most of the taper schedules are based on. 

I also understand it's common practice to switch to Diazepam, but am unsure if her PCP or prescribing psych has experience with such a switch. Should I find a specialist? I'm in northern New Hampshire, so detox specialists are rare, but it's obvious to me that her PCP is incompetent. 

Honestly, any advice or anecdotes would be useful in figuring out a taper schedule for her. The more information I have, the better. I am not working or schooling, so I will be here with her the entire time to keep her company and prevent her from compulsively redosing. Hopefully, by tapering slowly and controlling her meds, we can make this process relatively easy. 



Thank you for your time!",3

I ended up getting sober and going into an out patient clinic and they put me on suboxone. Over 2.5 years later, im still on the suboxone but I ended up finding myself addicted to benzos almost 2 years ago. I'm not using my ex as an excuse for my addiction, he just harrased and kept forcing himself in my life no matter what I did. I ended up with horrible anxiety from it and stupidly self medicated. Currently I'm in a happy healthy relationship, but I just want to get off these things. I never had a script. I first abused xanax and as of September I switched to kolonopin in an effort to taper off. I went from taking about 5-6 bars a day to just being on 2mg of kolonopin a day(take 1mg in the morming, 1mg at night.) I honestly don't have it in me to be tied down to this drug anymore. I feel it's ruining my joy for life. I don't know if I should admit myself to the er and detox or try to find an addiction psychiatrist. I don't want to tell my current out patient because I don't feel comfortable with the people there. I've been trying to taper off the suboxone and it's as If they don't want me to jump down whenever I am ready too, and try to convince me it's not time, therefore I feel like they won't offer me the best care of help.(I have managed to jump down from 12mg to 6mg in 1.5 years) My boyfriend is pressuring me to get help because he feels I am holding him back in life with my addiction which I can agree, we can't go on a vacation or anything of that sort. I do have trouble saving money but the pandemic didn't help me with my addiction or saving money. I guess I needed to vent and maybe hear what others did to get help and to get off this stupid fucking drug. I wish I never let myself even take another pill again after I got sober the first time.

Typically I bled lightly on Day 1, medium on days 2-3, and then lightly as it petered off on days 4-5. 


I finally tapered off valium in November and had a 45 day cycle with extremely light bleeding, combined with heavy cramping. It was so light that I couldn't use a cup or tampon, just panty liners. Essentially I spotted, but it continued for about 2-3 weeks! The cycle ran for 35 days and I had a 1 week reprieve before a new cycle started. It was a normal bleeding pattern that lasted for 5 days. That ""normal"" period was in December.


I proceeded to have a 46 day cycle with my next period beginning Feb 1. Again, I'm having cramping with such extremely mild bleeding that I cannot use my normal cup or even tampons. Even light pads are overkill, I'm just cramping and spotting. It's the third day of this and I'm desperately hoping that I don't have 3 weeks of spotting like I did the last time. 


When I had the first strange cycle after discontinuing valium, I was sure it was related to that. But now it's been a few months... I'm 34 years old, no children and have never been pregnant. Has this happened to other women after benzos or do you think it's unrelated? I really hope it's just a weird hormonal disruption from the benzos but my anxiety is telling me I'm going into early menopause 😅",7

I’m on week three of a four week Xanax “taper” implemented by my dr. He instructed me to drop .25 each week going from 2mg, to 1.75, 1.5. 1.25, then down to 1mg.. over 4 weeks. I’m currently supposed to be taking 1.25 but I know I haven’t been consistent because the symptoms are unbearable and I cannot function and do daily tasks without the Xanax. This is my primary care doctor and not a psychiatrist, but in my experience neither of the two know a single thing about proper tapering. I’ve been doing a lot of research online via the Ashton manual and other benzo recovery resources and I KNOW for a fact this taper is too fast and it’s putting me at an increased risk of severe symptoms and increased chance of failing to taper successfully. I follow up with my dr on 2/11 and at that point I should be taking 1mg/day which barely gets me by without suffering and I want to tell my dr that it’s moving too fast for me but i don’t want to to step on his toes since I feel like he was already frustrated at the fact that I was forming tolerance and began taking 2mg instead of 1mg a couple months ago.

Peak of my benzo withdrawal.,"I am prescribed yet I have been finding myself in and out of withdrawals from BZDs for well over a year now. I started with alcohol, then research chemicals and was still using them until recently. I may talk to my psychiatrist about getting off BZDs completely, at least for a while. 

**Below** is a passage from my diary, on a day I had lost hope and relapsed while trying to withdraw, because life happens. Feel free to use this as a way to explain to your family or those around you how you feel, without having to speak.

I feel a tiny bit better now, lets not forget that every day in pain and withdrawal gets better, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Where my end is, I cannot see. But there is one. For everyone. 

I am extremely confused and my brain is not working well, so don’t question why this post might be confusing.

##“I feel lifeless. I want to cease to exist. I can’t take these pills anymore. I have forgotten what sober happiness feels like. 

##Every day turns into a situation for anxiety medication. I want to withdraw in a safe facility. I cannot continue to be around family and friends for this. 

##I can’t begin to explain [my addiction] to anyone close to me. I am too scared to leave my room. How do I push through this? 

##I have a job, college and a life to maintain. All of which lead me to relapse. I can’t carry on. But it seems like my only option. 

##How does one suffer like this and keep living? I need a pill just to fake a smile. Yet that same pill will have me thinking, ‘what have I done?’ 

##I cannot blame anyone but myself. Mental hospitals are too expensive, a gun and some ammo would be cheaper. 

##To disappear. Wouldn’t that be nice? Paradise.

##But I can’t just shoot myself. I cannot traumatize my family, nor a bystander. I am running out of options.

##So help me lord, please, reset my brain, the pain is immeasurable. My head burns, it is about to explode. Just like my heart. 

##I cannot go on.
##12 - 31 - 2021”

But here I am. I am still alive. Every school day makes me take a pill, so I do not go to my class crazy and paranoid. I’ve been slowly lowering my dose. It is painful. 

This road is one that is so dreadful, yet you don’t hear about it except in these corners of the internet. Why? I do not understand.

I am not sure why I posted this, except as a reminder that we will get through this together and just need to carry on.

I am basically non functional now because of anxiety, but I have so much going on it is impossible to say how much is due to the effects of long term benzo use.","I have all types of anxiety disorders cptsd exc and have been living with chronic stress for a long time. I don’t know how I can confidently say how much of my discomfort is from chronic benzo use, perhaps tolerance withdrawal, or just the severe anxiety itself. I will say my most debilitating symptom or at least one of the physical symptoms is intense and insane levels of muscle tension, which I know is common with benzo issues, but it’s also common with severe anxiety, trauma issues and a whole bunch of other shit. I have been on benzos basically daily for 11 years or so at doses of around 1-2 mg for the most part, first 6 years or so xanax, last 5 klonopin. At times I took less than a mg a day, at times 3, but my most regular and sustained usage over the years would be 1-2 mg. Now I do feel awful everyday, especially physically, but again, while I hate being on benzos and they don’t help at all and hate how long I’ve been on them and the possible damage they’ve done, I have zero way of saying with certainty that my symptoms are from chronic prescribed use of these drugs and not from the severe anxiety and chronic stress I’ve lived with for so long, as well As having it in my head for so long now how horrible benzos are and how they could be causing all these symptoms exc. I’m the type to psych myself out constantly into feeling even worse then I would already, so having read all the ills of benzos for all these years is definitely constantly on my mind and has always been.

Anyways, if I am not currently nor have in the past abusing benzos (except when i first discovered them in college here and there before ever being scripted), upping my dose on my own to try and feel something from them again which i don’t think I Would anyway because of how insane my tolerance is, how would a short medical detox benefit me? I don’t understand how they benefit anyone? All the so called comfort meds they give for benzos i have tried from my aprn anyway and they have done nothing. I’ve probably been in tolerance withdrawal for a long time if anything, but again, it’s so difficult because again, how am I to say what is from the chronic benzo use and what is from just how terrible my anxiety is. It’s impossible for me to know, despite what some here might say with complete “certainty”. I know reading horror stories over the years online and having them become lodged into my conscious mind whenever my anxiety is rly horrid, has been horribly damaging, and maybe the benzos have been damaging as well, but again, I have no Fkn way of knowing that. Yes, my anxiety is worse Now at age 32 then it was when I began taking benzos scripted daily at 21, but again, how the F can I say with certainty it’s because of the long term benzo use and not just because my anxiety has gotten progressively worse with age through the years for a multitude of reasons.

Either way, is a long and drawn out taper not the way to go regardless of how uncomfortable I am everyday anyway? I don’t see how going into a place for a 10 day (at the most) detox and being rapidly taken off or cold turkeyed and then sent home is safe at all? I’ve never understood how these rapid detoxes works for benzos honestly. I’ve attempted a slow taper before from klonopin and was doing okay I guess until I got down to very low doses and then how mentally dependent I am I believe just scared the shit out of me from jumping so I botched it and began taking my dose again.

Again, benzos have not helped me in so long but I continued taking them because I didn’t want to cold turkey off them or possibly put up with worse anxiety coming off then I already suffer from on them.

So yes, I feel like shit everyday, but I don’t see how a detox would make that better. I mean If any of us could successfully and comfortably be detoxed off long term benzo use in 5-10 days I think we’d all Fkn do it, right? So am I wrong here or missing something? I should say I’ve had drug issues with opiates, recently, However, I am trying and have the will as I have before to stop and am on methadone. I’ve stopped using and don’t plan on it again (what everyone says though, right? I’m aware of that) and will probably up my methadone dose soon when able to, to help with that. I hate being dependent on methadone as well, but for right now it is what it is. That is another thing they are ignoring, that I would be cold turkeyed off methadone during this time as I don’t believe a detox place is gonna or even legally able to dispense me methadone while I’m there. 

I don’t abuse the benzos I am prescribed even when I am desperate for a bit of relief as I usually am because taking more would only go nowhere and make things worse and probably not even provide much relief anyway. At times in the past I have taken an extra mg or two during really horrible days, but this was never a regular or constant thing and definitely the exception, not the rule. I actually hate taking the benzos and get no enjoyment or relief from them, but keep taking it obviously because I’m not gonna cold turkey and see if I’m one the few lucky ones and if all this discomfort has very little to do with benzos and more so just my severe anxiety, psyching myself out, exc. For the tenth time, I know, it’s Fkn impossible for me to say what is what, which makes it all the more difficult. But still, I do not see how a benzo detox would help this situation. 

Am I wrong or missing something here? Thanks much for reading and sorry if some of this is all over the place. I’ve got bad brain fog among other shit so I always feel like these long posts of mine are making no sense as I’m typing them but I dunno. Thanks again very much.",7

So I've been on and off small doses of Ativan for a bit more than 2 years by now. My GP told me to take it ""when I feel the need"", until one day in mid 2020 I mistakenly took too much and got really scared (I was high and delirious for about 8 hours, dizzy, and I couldn't move my legs). Although my memory from that night is very fuzzy, I remember it being the best feeling of my life and since then I've found myself craving it a lot. In that period I noticed I started taking it a bit too much a bit too often for my liking and as I'm prone to addiction by genetics,  I've tried staying clear of it, but every 4-ish months I break my clean streak. Breaking my clean streak makes me feel like a disappointment, a failure, because I should be staying away from it and I cry every single time I take it.

In the past 3 weeks I had university exams and as I noticed myself struggling a lot, I took Ativan every day (not much really, just 1 or 2mg per day, but I am very light). I had my last dose on Thursday, but starting from Saturday morning I have been feeling extremely shit. I've gone back to having severe insomnia, even if my eyes are closing from tiredness I can't actually fall asleep, I have constant nausea and every morning I get bouts of really bad anxiety (worse than the one I had for my exams) for no reason, which make me throw up until I kind of get over it, in the early afternoon. But even then I have a lack of appetite (which is weird because I used to really like eating). I also get dizzy much more easily than usual, and I stumble on walls and stuff, but this has been getting better today. Moreover I've never been craving Ativan as much as now. 

I feel like I've done a really stupid thing to take it again and for a prolonged period of time (since until now I only took it on singular occasions), and I am disappointed with myself for breaking my almost 6 months clean streak. And maybe this is just what I deserve, and what will make me stop once and for all. I haven't felt this bad in ages.

Is this withdrawal or am I imagining it? In case it is, is there any advice to make this better? Any advice for keeping clear of Ativan in case there's a next time in which I'll want to take it?",5

The worst symptom is that I have very little appetite but it's not just a lack of appetite but that feeling of one's stomach being sort of tied in a knot and feeling a sort of spasm that runs right up my esophagus. I have been on and off Klonopin several times in the past and did not experience this. This seems to be the primary WD symptom this time.
been taking large amounts of CBD which might help a little bit but not enough, small amounts of Delta 8 tincture a couple puffs of weed. I'm fairly sensitive to THC so don't really want to go overdo either. Any suggestions on something else to help relax that spasmy tied in a  knot feeling? 
I took Klonopin for sleep, and am realizing I would rather just get a shitty night sleep than not be able to eat.",2
2022-02-01 20:51:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/sic4vm/interdose_withdrawal/,Interdose withdrawal,"Begin taking .25 to .5 mg Klonopin per night mid november. I have taken it on and off plenty over the years for a few months to a couple years. This time I am noticing that by late afternoon I am feeling some withdrawal symptoms, it took me a little to catch on to what was going on, like why do I start getting so edgy at this time of the afternoon.
Right now I am working on quitting ASAP because I hate the way it makes me feel so I am working on just sticking with the .25 mg for about a week and then stopping. I quit at the same dose after longer periods of use before without a problem but never experienced introduced withdrawal before. So my question is, does a period of say five or six hours during the day when one is experiencing some degree of withdrawal and the quantity is apparently quite low in my system help me any and quitting or couldn't make it harder? I mean are those hours when it's very low in my system and I am experiencing some symptoms helping to recondition my body to being without it, or does the fact that I still take a dose at the end of the night just sort of cancel any of that out?",1

Has anyone switched from clonazepam to diazepam and had greater success tapering from diazepam? 

Everytime I taper with my doctor I get really bad withdrawal symptoms even from SMALL reductions. 

I sent the Ashton manual to my doctor and I hope this will just make things a little bit easier. This drug feels nearly impossible to taper off of and no matter how slow I go it still ends up really bad.",3
2022-02-01 09:07:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/shvsrt/im_curious_about_what_the_statistics_are_for/,I’m curious about what the statistics are for people who suffered hellish effects when coming off Benzos and their alcohol intake.,"I started on November 24th or 2020 with a box of lorazepam (I think it was 20x2mg) then (when that ran out) I got a box of kpins (I think about 30x1mg) then when that ran out I switched to Valium (100x10mg) because I knew the desire to take more pills throughout the day was coming. So I figured switching to a lower strength benzo would help with that. I am half way through my second box of 100x10mg. 

I am wanting to come off of it completely. My life has become amazing since I started using (waking up early, getting straight up, working out for 2-3 hours, being incredibly self motivated, going to bed early etc. but hearing the horror story’s here is making me want to stop. I’ve also used ketamine therapeutically twice over the last week and that has given me more respect for reality. 

Now… so I think I have been using about 40-50mg of Valium a day for the last month. And am about to begin my taper. 

But… my real question…. How many of you who suffered extreme negative effects abused alcohol while they abused Benzos? That’s the one thing I avoided. Alcohol. I used edibles (I’ve used pot daily for 20 years). But that’s it. I’m curious to know how many people who really suffered also used alcohol during their benzo addiction? 

Thank you all and I wish you all and myself better life after recovery.",6
2022-02-01 04:07:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/shqme1/update_on_taper_from_extended_release_alprazolam/,Update on taper from extended release alprazolam.,"Putting this information out there given how seldom I see posts about extended release alprazolam and honestly how so few people seem to know it even exists. I started 2mg of extended release alprazolam after a rapid spike in the severity of my panic disorder in Feb 2021 and using farmapram bought in Mexico taking 6 mg + a day for a month or two because I couldn’t afford a psychiatrist at the time . I have been on and off many benzodiazepines over the last 10 year and I tolerated Xanax the best.

I really enjoyed the extended release and am grateful for the purpose it served. For myself, I can go almost 12 hours from last dose before I start feeling any unbearable withdrawal symptoms. It didn’t make me sleepy/groggy so I could take one in the morning and still feel functional while not experiencing panic attacks at work or school. 

Dosage:
2 months ago, I willingly (and medically supervised) started tapering from 1mg 2x a day for a total of 2mg. I’m now on 0.5mg of extended release 3x a day for a total of 1.5mg a day. I have a deep family history of alprazolam abuse and given I have some more stability in my life now, wanted to try to slowly come down.

Withdrawal:
The first month was rough. I had days where I had relatively no symptoms. Then others where I experienced a range of intense withdrawal symptoms. It has not been linear but that seems to be relatively common.

Symptoms:

- constant internal “vibrating” feeling
- very unpleasant joint + muscle pains
- occasionally hearing unintelligible voices especially at night 
- insomnia
- irritability 
-  headaches 
- complete loss of appetite 

Given these symptoms my doctor and I agreed it best to maintain my dose at 1.5mg a day for now. My withdrawal symptoms seem to be leveling out and lessening in severity overall so I feel encouraged by that. I am admittedly nervous about the next jump to 1mg a day. I would love to hear if anyone else has experience with the extended release form (taking it, what you thought of it, tapering etc.)",5
