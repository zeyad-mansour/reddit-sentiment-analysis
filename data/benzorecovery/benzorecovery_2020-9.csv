I don't know what to do.

I am currently at .50mg of V, (cut from .6mg a week ago) and today something happened.

I work with technical/analytical stuff and today after working a bit, overthinking and insisting on doing it while already feeling mentally exhausted I entered ""overheat mode"" with a part of my brain next to my right temple feeling like it's in flames. I wouldn't describe exactly as pain, but is very intense and debilitating. I had to stop working like 3 hours ago and I am still feeling bad with the same part of my head still feeling like with high pressure from the inside and hot and aching.

Last time something similar happened to me, I tried to sleep and the following day I woke up with my hand and my foot persistently tingling even after minutes from waking up.

I am scared and the right side of my head still feels like is burning inside, I don't know if it's ""normal"" benzowise or if I passed the point of no return. Should I go to the ER?

Blood pressure and pulse are almost normal, but in the worst part of this experience I was avoiding any social contact even at home as even formulating phrases or listening made me feel even worse as if I was processing tons of information after 'overheating'.

I am at a point in my life where I am feeling very unsure of what to do to feel better. I have been on Xanax for 6 years now. I have been on .5mg for probably around 3 years. My doctor upped my dose to 1mg a couple years back, but I have almost always taken half of my pill, unless I was feeling especially anxious-then I would take a whole one. But generally I only take .5mg every day or every other day. I have been feeling irritable pretty regularly for the past 2 years. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I was angry all of the time, and would come up with other reasons not related to Xanax. As I‚Äôve lurked on this subreddit and read your guys experiences I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I‚Äôve been putting myself in withdrawals because I haven‚Äôt upped my dose in years. The frustration I‚Äôve been feeling is ridiculous, my brain doesn‚Äôt feel the same, it‚Äôs hard to form complete sentences sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to leave the house most of the time. I don‚Äôt want to take more Xanax because that‚Äôs more that I‚Äôll have to taper off of once I finally feel ready. But I‚Äôm also sick of feeling so frustrated all the time, and I‚Äôm really starting to believe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not taking enough Xanax for my tolerance. I hate being so dependent on a pill. It never feels like the right time to start a taper, especially now with a 1 year old, an 8 year old, and this epidemic. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for people who understand what I‚Äôm going through. Should I take more Xanax and feel better in my day to day, and pay for it later? Is it really that big of a difference to taper off .5mg vs 1mg?

I‚Äôm in my late 30s always abused Benzos to some extent, my sheer anxiety would never let me get too bad and I would taper myself and never felt any withdrawals beyond tossing and turning for 2 nights....would take 2 sticks a day and smoke massive amounts of weed...I would also get prescribed 60 1milligram lorazepam a month, I would use those within a week and then grab sticks to hold me over 

I stopped taking the sticks  for a good 2 years and would only use the 60 lorazepam , but abuse them, take 10 at a time first 4 nights  ( I think 4 equal a stick and they don‚Äôt hit me as hard ) and then 8,6,4,3,3,2,2 and stop for the next 2-3 weeks and not skip a beat, usually smoke more pot those last weeks but never any withdrawal and mood stayed pretty stable 

Quarantine hits and I‚Äôm working from home, smoking more pot with the extra time and then eventually getting the urge for some sticks since it‚Äôs been so long ...

quarantine agave me an unbelievable amount of free time and I started playing poker on the internet like I use to do in college and had some success , so one week I win 10k and decide it‚Äôs gonna be a party and grabbed 100 sticks ( no one sells a handful anymore , tough to get and only thing available) thankfully my friend came over saw the sticks , took 80 and only let me keep 20 lol anyway I took 2 a day at night to relax like I use to all the time, and then I started a quick taper by taking  1 stick and then a half to taper but for the first time ever I got withdrawal symptoms , shortness of breath mostly and crazy anxiety ..very scary but subsided within a day or two 

Now I‚Äôm back to the usually 60 a month, which I thought I could always handle by abusing and having fun with 40 of them , quick taper and a few weeks without but I‚Äôm finally sick of even that , so last taper I kept going and never filled script 

I‚Äôm on day 24 no Benzos , I‚Äôm smoking a lot of pot but noticed the depression sucks lol and I have no desire to work out, eat healthy , be productive ( all things I have been doing well with the 60 lorazepam in my system ) 

My questions have to deal with the timeline...so I think I can will myself to start working out again and also eat healthy but right now I legit do nothing but smoke pot and take edibles and wait for it to get dark to go to sleep , bored all day long once work is over...I enjoy reading but can‚Äôt concentrate long enough to read more than 5 pages, same with playing poker online, don‚Äôt even have the will to start playing ...when will the concentration improve ? Does it lol God, I hope so 

My memory has always been good even with all the pot, but that ship has sailed lately lol I‚Äôm a burn out and forget a lot of things, Will this improve with time ? 

My last question is sex drive, I barely have one but will still watch porn at night to help with the sleep lol 
Anyway , the first 2-3 days without the lorazepam my sex drive is high and I might reach out to an old girlfriend or acquaintance to fulfill that need but once that is over I instantly regret it , like a bad one night stand , then I still have to talk to this person etc and I remember why we stopped seeing each other in the first place lol so when I‚Äôm on the lorazepam, I don‚Äôt really care about sex, I would choose 10 lorazepam, pot and food over hanging out with a girl and sex and obv that isn‚Äôt normal lol will I ever get a normal sex drive off these things ?",0,{'quarantine': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4926082}"

I‚Äôve been suffering from nerve pain for over a year and I don‚Äôt take meds for it. It often keeps me awake at night it‚Äôs horrible.
Weirdly I‚Äôve found that valium and Xanax tremendously helps with the pain to the point where I can actually sleep, although it is never (that I know of) prescribed by doctors for that matter. They‚Äôll usually give you something like Gabapentin or Lyrica which I‚Äôve heard isn‚Äôt that great and doesn‚Äôt always work. 
Anyway. I used to take benzo mostly at night when I‚Äôm felling anxious, sad and if I can‚Äôt sleep and have stuff to do the next day. 
But recently my pain has been SO BAD that I litteraly end up taking benzos for the pain, in order to sleep. 
I managed to get a (fake) prescription for 0.5mg of Xanax. I used to take it once a while, then once a week, then every 2 days, now it‚Äôs like everyday... id take between 0.25 and 0.5, never more. 
I‚Äôm scared of becoming addicted to it, and I feel like my tolerence is building up as a half used to be enough but now I take a whole 0.5mg.
I don‚Äôt want to get into this vicious circle, but I litteraly cannot bare the pain at night and that‚Äôs the only that helps.
Im going to try to quit ASAP, I‚Äôve ordered some CBD buds (they help a bit) and a strong (and expensive) antioxidants well known to treat neuropathic pain.

I've never posted before but have been following this sub for almost a year now. I'm feeling really hopeless right now and just searching for some advice. Last October I was put on zoloft and xanax. The first night I took zoloft I ended up in the E.R. because I thought I was going to kill myself. I continued taking the xanax. I was prescribed 0.5 mg xanax 3 times a day. I have tried my best to only take one pill at night. Sometimes if im having a rough day ill take a half of one during the day. I decided i don't want to be dependent on anything. So I stopped cold turkey 3 days ago and now I feel completely unstable. I dont know if its in my head reading through the posts on here that im having rebound anxiety, or if i actually am. I dont know what to do, but to give in and just say fuck it I'll be on benzos forever if it helps me sleep at night??

My parents are very kind and supportive of me and so they are worried sick about me. I had a sob session a few days ago with my Mother in which I told her about some of the things that were bothering me in life currently, that i was generally all round quite fed up with how my life is going (currently not able to go to school with what i have) and just generally having what i think could be described as a mild mental breakdown.

Today my parents came into my room and said they wanted to talk. Alright i thought, something suspicious is going on. they then proceeded to tell me how bad they 'knew' i was feeling and that perhaps taking xanax would help me. i told them i wasnt sure and that i would have to think about it. truth is i have no intention of taking it. keep in mind i have no suicidal thoughts and my anxiety is relatively low, not non existent but low.
i have had crippling anxiety in the past and right now i am perfectly capable of dealing with this amount without medication. it is hard to come to terms with the fact that my disease may last my entire life, but i can face that fact with a clear, unsedated mind.

So the question is, how do i convince my parents that i dont need it? they think that i need it, and that i am just being stubborn or something like that.

It was my birthday present to myself haha. I took the Xanax for 6 years, it was originally prescribed for anxiety and sleep issues. I tapered down for about a month (roughly) just by decreasing the dosage and then skipping days.

The last 4 months have been quite hellacious. Not as bad as some I read on here, but I immediately went into complete insomnia, random pains (esp in my legs), random anxiety and panic attacks. I completely lost the will to do my normal walking/running and exercising routine and gained 18 pounds. 

The insomnia was such a killer and lasted for so long that I was ONE DAY away from starting the Xanax back up when I had my first night of real sleep. I'd almost forgotten what that was like and I was afraid it was a one-off, but I'm pretty confident that it is here to stay (about a week now). With the normal sleep has come a desire to start walking and exercising again. My anxiety has become way less. I'm getting to bed earlier and earlier, instead of waiting until the wee hours.

There were a few time periods when my anxiety and panic disorder needed to be better controlled and the dosage was increased, but no longer than 3 months or so.

Yes, I did ask if it was safe for me to just quit after that amount of time and requested to taper- he said he didn't think it was necessary. Several other medical professionals were appalled.

After my time with benzos, I can honestly say that they messed me up way more than alcohol did. Alcohol is GABA-ergic like benzos, but having been an alcoholic as well- I can tell you that the detox from alcohol is not nearly as bad. When I quit drinking, I literally just updosed on Valium for 4 days and at the end of that my system was essentially ""reset"" from a 15 beer a day drinking habit. If only getting off benzos was that easy... some detox doctors strive for something similar by giving a different class of GABA-ergic  drugs(normally phenobarbital ) instead of benzos, but from what I hear there is still months of pain in this method.

Alcohol can cause significant damage to the  liver when consumed daily for years in large amounts, but for durations shorter than that it really is not significantly toxic. The body seems to also resist alcohol dependence to a MUCH greater extent than benzo dependence, While both conditions can cause similar and dangerous symptoms and are often thought of as essentially ""the same thing""- people can generally drink for far longer and harder than they can abuse benzos without the body developing a dependency. In fact, the people who do get the most severe withdrawal symptoms from alcohol normally have years of kindling(significantly less likely to withdrawal severely your first time compared to benzos). You don't normally hear of people in their 20s going through severe withdrawal issues from alcohol (though it does happen) despite most people in their 20s drinking- yet almost everyone (in their 20s) knows at least one person who got dependent on benzos.  Therefore- I think that telling a patient to drink a few IPAs for anxiety as needed could be better than telling them to take a Xanax or a Klonopin-which we all know to be much less forgiving in terms of dependency and tolerance. Yet drinking alcohol to medicate anxiety is seen as a toxic behavior, even by the same doctors who prescribe Xanax? I really do not understand and this is coming from someone who actually has personally experienced numerous health problems firsthand from chronic heavy drinking..... Id honestly prefer that over the brainfuck that benzos has given me. 

&#x200B;

Benzos also feel so deceptively clean- I mean a lot of time you don't even realize you are fucked up on them. You don't know what it is doing to you until you start to experience interdose discomfort (even with long acting benzos!) or you start to taper.

I have gotten myself into a bit of a pickle during quarantine.

**tl,dr** at the bottom.

Some back story, about 4 years ago I got my hands on some conazolam and ended up going on a crazy 3 month bender of god knows how many mg a day. I bought pills of 0.5mg in bags of 50 and they would be gone in no time. Anyway, don't remember much of this period. I quit after one of my best friends, a drug enthusiast himself, told me he didn't like the person I became and that was quite the wake up call for me. I managed to quit cold turkey which was agonizing, probably dangerous and cost me my job and my house. I swore never to do it again.

Fast forward to the beginning of the quarantine here in the south of Europe, and a fateful drunken night I ended up ordering 0.5g of clonazolam and diluting it in a solution of pg to 0.25mg a ml (I know, I am a fucking idiot for falling for it again, but o well). All for 30 euros. So I had this unlimited supply of the substance and started abusing it like crazy for the first 5 months. Whole conversations, days, weeks, months gone from my memory. I don't know how much I was taking but a rough guess would be 10-25mg a day.

During the last month I have been trying to taper and I have stabilized around 0.25mg 3 times a day (morning, lunch, and after work), and 2.5mg at night roughly, this because of it¬¥s relatively short life span. I can function relatively OK and I am managed to move to a new city, get a job and hold it down so far. Though my memory is still far from good and I feel absolutely empty inside.

My main problem with this is that I will start feeling WD if I miss one or two of those doses, especially the one at night. I¬¥ll get the whole gamut of symptoms: de-realization, de-personalization, 9/10 anxiety whole day, constant full alert, over-stimulation, really negative thoughts, I¬¥ll feel the left side of my chest hurting as if I were to have a heart attack in the next few minutes, horrible half-sleep with nightmares where I just get out of bed at 5am because fuck it, and the worst stuttering I have ever experienced, I can not form a sentence.

Currently I am still in possession of about 375 mg of clonazolam and I could get more. I have been looking around for diclazepam for weeks now, but no one seems to have it, so I am left with two options.

Try to taper with clonazolam, or go to a psychiatrist and hopefully get a prescription for diazepam.

**tl,dr**: My question really is, has anyone here managed to taper of clonazolam directly, and if so what is the best way to go about it. I read the Ashton manual and I understand the general idea, but I would like to hear some first hand experience from you guys.

This is my personal experience and I am in no way trying to downplay others' experiences as I know benzo's are the fourth hardest things to quit behind coke, meth, and heroin.

I am tapering off of 2mg of Ativan - I have been taking it for the last 5 years since my brain tumor diagnosis. 

My taper is 6-months. I have not felt any withdrawal symptoms and I am around 1.4mg. 

I stopped a 9-year daily kratom habit, daily drinking, and nicotine which was beyond terrible but have not felt a thing tapering Ativan. Really bizarre. My dreams are super intense, which is kind of cool. 

I, like many of you, was reading all the horror story's online and my doctor was like stop reading that crap, you will be fine. He gave me gabapentin - I have less anxiety and I am tapering, lol, crazy.

Gabapentin is a strange drug. I took it for months and just stopped and had no issue, I mention because I read horror stories about Gabapentin withdrawal.  I still use like three-five days a week (I drink on the weekends) It is really hard to get ""addicted"" to it, it is not pleasurable. My psychologist said not to worry at all because stopping Gabapentin is easy and I agree with her.  

I always took Ativan at night after a big meal. I mean I eat a lot at night, and I wonder if that is why it is so easy to taper, because when you eat you get less of the drug in your system. IDK how true that is but just thought of it. 

This YouTube video really helped me - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkY1pU0ZOXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkY1pU0ZOXE) 

Keep a notebook as you shave off the pill using a razor blade and write down your dose.  If you feel like the taper is intolerable then just go slower.  Rember it is all about you, some take a year, some take 3 months.

I have an initial phone assessment Monday morning with the recovery centre I have been with before . I will make sure I do it properly and with the correct medical assistance. 

I have been using 30-10mg valium almost daily for about two years. Sometimes 30mg. I take them as 10mg tablets ""as needed"" and am now at a point where I feel mentally strong enough to stop and am ready to beat this disease. When lockdown started I planned to quit as I was aware what I was doing was dangerous and was no longer feeling like I needed them. but my passed friend passed away at the end of march and I was left unable to cope sober. 

I have experienced codeine and pregabalin withradawal before and that was horrible, but I got through it and have never looked back at those substances. My last drink was the day after my 30th birthday this year, 29th August. I am lucky enough to not be addicted to alcohol as It makes me feel proper shit. 

if anyone can let me know what I am in for it would be very much appreciated so I can brace myself, I feel like the specialist social worker people try their best and I am so grateful for them but I am aware that they might not have first hand experience so I'm hoping I can use this sub for guidance! 

 I just need the perspective of someone who has beaten this. I am lucky enough to be able to work from home starting next week so I'm hoping that will make any symptoms easier to handle instead of being in an office surrounded by people watching my every move. 

 If anyone has any experiences they can share from a similar situation to mine id really appreciate it so I know what I'm in for, and also any tips the nurses might not now about, like should I stop smoking weed too or will that help with the inevitable insomnia and appetite problems?

He grew up in a very neglectful and toxic environment with a rampaging alcoholic father, in later years my partner would be diagnosed with schizotypal but his parents completely neglected all of his medical needs and even many of his basic needs. 

I saw a number of foster care kids over the years that suffered psychologically from this kind of neglect mixed with instability in the home, it takes years to help them rehabilitate from this upbringing, years to learn basic living skills like hygiene and general self-care. 

Everyone around my partner knew he had special needs, but he was guilted and attacked for being disabled in his country. There is a very real cultural stigma here towards the disabled. Despite this, he taught himself English from cartoons, he tried to teach himself skills to help himself to heal. His mother fully expected him to cure himself of his mental illnesses completely on his own with only dense new-age books to use. 

New-age faith healing literature back then made him go psychotic, then catatonic for 2 years. Ativan was the only thing that helped him out of his catatonia. He wasn't even allowed to speak to the psychiatrist, his mother's acquaintance, directly. He was told to sit outside the meeting while his mom had social hour with this doctor, as they both gossiped about him behind closed doors. He was also thrown on risperidone at some point too but he detoxed himself off of that one prior to us meeting. 

His illnesses are perceived as pure laziness here, his relatives didn't even believe he actually knew English. He even taught himself German, though he can only understand it, he can't speak it. Oddly he can pick up some Japanese too like this from cartoons and sometimes he messes with me by saying, ""„Åä„Å´„ÅÑ„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÇÑ„ÇÅ„Å¶ÔºÅ„ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÑÔºÅ„Å†„ÇÅ„Å†„ÇàÔºÅ"" Which is a line that pops up a lot in some very creepy hentai. He can't read or write in Japanese at all, he picked it up just from watching cartoons. He absorbs languages like this. 

He is so brilliant and hardworking, he teaches himself so much, but his own culture and family was condemning because he was disabled. I resented this, I hated this so much, so I fled my abusive relatives and country, I am originally from the states, to make my way to him. 

Before I arrived, he was taking the Ativan inconsistently, no one was helping him take his meds, his mom half-assed got boxes of the meds from her friend when she felt like it but she didn't understand (nor cared to understand) how critical it was for someone to administer these meds to him. He came from a relatively affluent household and he didn't even have a bed to sleep in. It is a special kind of madness in that house.  

I arrived in August of 2014 and we were given his grandmother's old flat and we lived here ever since. He had to finish his undergraduate studies in Psychology, a major that he picked out of pure desperation to cure himself, at the OU and I supported him in this. He finished his undergraduate with good grades in his 2nd language, a language he taught himself, and these people still didn't respect his merit. 

I've not met another person in this country yet, much less a disabled one, who was able to teach themselves fluent/native speaker levels of English with no tutoring/learning materials while surviving an unstable environment with neglect and emotional abuse. 

He had to finish his education in October of 2015 in order for us to begin his detox from Ativan. 

He was left on Ativan for 5 years, the toll this med took on him and how no one cares, it rips me apart every day. In the fall of 2015 we tried to get assistance from his psychiatrist then, a very old school Eastern European kind of doctor. This doctor used to be in the military, maybe the navy, I'm not sure. But we paid out of pocket for him, we were trying to get help from him to get my partner off of the Ativan, this doctor wrote my partner up a script for Xanax and Effexor and said, in my partner's native language (he knew no English), that there was no hope of my partner ever quitting benzos, all he could do was switch him to a different one. 

This enraged me, I looked at that script as my partner and I had cheeseburgers together at a lovely burger shop then. That was the same med regimen that I was first put on when I broke down in college. I attempted suicide on Xanax, Effexor contributed to my alcoholism. My partner is very genetically vulnerable to alcoholism, his father's whole side are incredibly debilitated alcoholics and this country enables alcoholism. 

My partner deserved better than what I got, I didn't want him to suffer the same downward spiral like I did when I turned to dismissive and uncaring psychiatrists for help when I was drowning alone. We ended up paying out of pocket for that appointment and not getting that script filled.

While we were on the bus home, my partner on his phone looked up benzo recovery resources, namely water-titration. He researched the protocol, but he wasn't stable enough to implement any of it. 

Luckily, I am pretty handy and good at chemistry. So that winter we looked up detox schedules with water-titration and we started this detox journey together. We also did the leg work to get my partner out-patient therapy during this detox. 

The details of this detox are a bit fuzzy because this was a very stressful and scary time period, everyday I feared that my partner would have a seizure or worse, so we went slow and careful. 

There was one protocol that called for shaving off 1/4 of the dose per week, this was too much too fast so we had to abandon that.

We looked up another schedule example, it was in an excel spreadsheet and I modified/printed it out. I started with 100ml of water with 1mg of Ativan, and each day I shaved off 1ml. This worked up to a certain point, when we got to 70% (70ml out of 100ml) of his original dose we ran into problems so we hovered at that dose for several days. 

The rate of tapering was still too fast and he was having horrible brain fog, gut issues, bewilderment, and irritability, he lashed out at me hard then, I was terrified and struggling to cope with my own issues while I supported him and measured out his meds. I had vivid nightmares everyday from the lingering effects of Seroquel and trauma, back then I was awakened by his yelling or relapsing (he had a very debilitating addiction to pornography that he developed as a child to cope with his upbringing, porn was his only friend growing up, this addiction has since been remedied as well). I only had maybe 4 hours of sleep on average for the first 3 years we were together, none of his relatives (besides his mom throwing some money at us from time to time) helped me help him.  

I realized that the major brick wall was that Ativan is not water nor fat soluble, I was hand-grinding these pills with a pestle and mortar, but this wasn't cutting it anymore. I tried to dissolve it in milk, this was a bust. Dissolving it in alcohol with our combined vulnerability to alcoholism was not a viable option other. We were in worse shape financially then, and I had to run out and drop a good chunk of change quite hastily on a blender to better blend up these meds. This greatly stabilized the process and we were able to continue. 

We were getting Ativan pills from his mom, we were never able to get to her local psychiatrist friend directly. This was stressful because she didn't take the whole pill or detox situation seriously. We were very much at the mercy of her whim, luckily she was compliant enough and got us the meds but we had to remind her multiple times ahead of time to make sure we didn't run out. 

During the winter/spring of 2016 my partner was traveling to a town an hour from us on bus for out-patient therapy while he was detoxing from his meds. He was put on Zoloft/Trazadone/Buspar, which stabilized things more, he is still currently on the Zoloft (200mg) and the Trazadone (30mg), the Buspar wasn't really helping him that much and it seemed to make him more bewildered. 

We were able to continue the detox until we hit another massive brick wall at around 60% of his original dose. I saw that the particles of the pill, though finely ground up, were sinking straight to the bottom even when I shook the contents. This meant that he was getting wildly inconsistent doses despite my measurements. We needed to find some way to dissolve this pill better. 

I had him hover at this dose for some weeks as we searched for a new thing to try. I had to comb forums and benzo recovery pages, and in these sources I saw discussions of how Ativan was (debatably) soluble in PEG-400/propylene glycol. We tried to buy either of these chemicals from pharmacies but they wouldn't sell it to us. 

His mother runs a health store and is easily able to get such chemicals wholesale through her connections. We went to her house to get her to order this for us, we didn't know how to order it ourselves. Amazon wasn't an option and the places that sell the stuff are in my partner's native language, which even google translate can barely handle, and my partner was in horrible shape. He couldn't order it himself. We asked her to buy us some propylene glycol so that her son wouldn't have a seizure from this detox. 

His mother acted so disgusting then, she gossiped about how much of a pussy my partner was for needing a special chemical to help him detox from one little pill to his sister over the phone. They both laughed together over the phone as my partner and I endured that humiliation to get him what he needed to heal. This woman somehow has a masters degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology from her country, and runs a health store and gives people heath advice, but she didn't understand how horrible benzos and detoxing from them are. She refused to understand the toll this all took on her own son. 

She ordered us a liter of propylene glycol, 10x more than what we needed for the detox, and it only costed her $4. This woman is affluent, and she was petty about $4. 

I buried my disgust for her actions and integrated 1ml of propylene glycol into the detox. I would hand-grind up the pill in the pestle and mortar with the 1ml of propylene glycol, then I would be very careful to mix up the 100ml of water in the mortar, making sure all of the med was in the solution as much as possible. Then I would throw this into the blender and blend it all up. Then I would subtract the 40ml dose to get it to 60% of his original dose. 

He took in that dose and he got high, he was high from it, this scared me at first but then I realized just how unstable the dosing was without the propylene glycol. With the addition of the 1ml of propylene glycol, the particles were evenly distributed through the solution. This was a massive game changer, and we were able to step down to 30% of his original dose by fall of 2016. 

At this point we were able to get a new psychiatrist, a younger gal. She spoke fluent English and him and I attended these appointments together to discuss things. She was a much better doctor, and I still grateful that we found her back then. 

I showed her the detox schedule and the progress we made, every single detail that I could think to cover. She agreed with the procedure and wrote up a script for diazepam, I nearly teared up. She also got him to an autism specialist, I thought he had aspergers like me at the time, and this too was amazing. He would be later diagnosed with schizotypal by another specialist, him and I both agree with this diagnosis. 

I transitioned my partner off of Ativan and onto Diazepam for the remainder of his detox. Diazepam stabilized him more because it burns out of the system slower than Ativan, it was far less jarring for him. He fully detoxed in October of 2016. 

It is nearly 4 years later from then, he is in far better shape than he's ever been in his life, but he still has neurological and gut issues from benzos and from what he has been through. 

Biotin seems to really help him, especially when he gets bewildered. 

His relatives still don't take him seriously even after curing himself of so many ailments. He has accomplished so much with so little and they still belittle him. He has written ebooks in English, made e-courses in English to help other people, he has a masters in 3D animation now and is currently teaching himself 3D modeling so he can make those cartoons and animations he has always dreamed of making and they STILL don't take him seriously. They still see him as this lazy and entitled idiot, and it is their loss.

It is so hard to not resent them sometimes but we are more distant from them. They are ill, they are ill and warped people, but my partner is not like them. Him and I have fought alone for years to improve our health. 

For those out there that are struggling to detox from benzos, it is possible, you can make it, even if no one around you believes in you. I know this is a long post, but thank you all for your time and for reading.

Earlier this year, between February and April (roughly) I was between 1mg to 3.5mg of Klonopin daily. This was especially due to my final semester of university which was particularly challenging, and the obvious being quarantine and life changes it caused.
 I‚Äôm prescribed 1mg daily, and I‚Äôm also learning how harmful that prescription can be from information in this sub and others. 
I‚Äôve somehow managed to get down to between 1mg and 1.25 mg daily. I really only need it at night and early in the morning to go back to sleep, since I cut back I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep through the night.  When I take a small dose in the morning I‚Äôm usually fine for the day (it took a long time to get to this point, ironically I don‚Äôt really even fully remember how bad it was and it was only May/June.) Today I got out my pill cutter and cut them all in half so as to have smaller doses naturally and be able to split them. 
My problem is that I cannot get comfortable at 1mg. I can‚Äôt sleep through the night, I have trembles all day, increased anxiety, etc. I‚Äôve been at this dose for about a week and a half (I may be a bit impatient, I know.) Any tips on how to get through this final push down to my plan of .5mg and then .25mg?

A year ago I began the long, S L O W journey to get off Klonopin and began tapering.

I had been on it for a year and a half prior and up to 2mgs a day when I decided it was doing more harm than good. I have had a lot of bumps in the road...I spent months stuck at .50 mg because I had a couple of huge life events occur. But as of this summer I am back on track.

I am currently at .30mg daily for the last 2 weeks and making the next cut to .25 mg next week.

I have been doing this on my own. (Not with a Dr.) I have been using the titration method. 

I have crappy days, usually days 3-7 after a cut, but I am learning to cope with it. Mostly increased anxiety, derealization, stomach issues, back aches and trouble sleeping. But it passes, and I know it passes so it helps get me through and I think of it as ""healing pains"" I have had constant brain fog through all of this. But sometimes I have windows and feel like my old self again. Oh, I how I long for those to last longer.

I don't mind going slow if it benefits me in the long run. I'm kind of listening to my body after cuts and staying at each one 2 or 3 weeks depending on how I feel. I have come to expect the unexpected with this.

My questions.

I have read that sometimes the last stretch is the toughest. Has anyone found that to be true? 

I have been holding my last cuts 2-3 weeks average. Should I hold longer as I make cuts and get lower? 

Do you think these cuts are reasonable? ( I was thinking next cut .25 then, .20, .15, .10, .075, .05., .025. jump)

What is a good/safe point at which to jump off? Because I am dissolving 2mg pills in 400 MLs of liquid I can get a small dose. So was planning on a jump at .025

First post here ever, but Ive been reading along for a while. 
Heres a quick backstory of the situation: my girl and I, have been using alprazolam as sleeping meds daily for about 18 months. The reason for our insomnia, was too frequent use of GBL. 
The use of GBL continued, although not on a daily basis, it was still pretty heavy. Especially from february to august this year, where it escalated into 24/7 abusing GBL in the last 6 weeks. 
Im very happy to say that we quickly tapered down the G and today is day 24 without it. 
But as expected, the need for our daily sleeping dose of alprazolam was still needed. Even before doing G all the time, we would do 3-4 day benders, thus damaging the GABA system and therefor created the habit/need for alprazolam for getting sleep. 

Now we are trying to taper down/quit the pills as fast as possible, and Ive been researching quite a bit. 

When reading the Ashton Manual, she breaks up the daily dosage of alprazolam into x 4 doses, eventually easing into using diazepam instead. 

But how does it work for people in our situation. We do not take benzos for anxiety or anything else. ONLY sleep. 
Should we just follow the Ashton scale, but simply taking one dose before bed as we normally do? 

Also, I can see why diazepam is more useful for tapering for things like anxiety. But seing how we are not looking to feel ‚Äúsedated‚Äù during the day. A thing I feel diazepam causes because of the long halflife compared to alprazolam. 
So would it make more sense to hang on to the alprazolam and simply tapering those without switching to diazepam? 
Even considering CT at this point. Sick of needing pharma to sleep. 
My current dose is 1,25 mg alprazolam. Worked my way down from 2mg during the course of a month give or take. 

So whats your opinion. We have alprazolam, diazepam, zopiclone and promethazine available.

It makes me useless, and I prefer marijuana  but as anyone with anxiety ocd knows a good night sleep can really hit the spot when attacking the next day.  

I was ignorant to think that I would feel withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours and that never taking it two days  in a row would keep me from dependence.  I noticed that 2 mgs wasn‚Äôt packing the same punch so when I ran out I decided to take a break from it and didn‚Äôt refil my rx.  I started feeling off about a week in.

So I am at around 4 mgs spread out over a week.

I started doing benzos a year and two months ago, to be more exact with dates, July 2019. I started taking klonopin every once in a while, ‚Äúrecreationally‚Äù, once every week, two weeks and so, until September when I started popping them on a daily basis, BIG amounts & combined with other stuff... it wasn‚Äôt until a friend of mine got into rehab the last days of October when I went off the rails and started doing them even more often and of course increasing the amounts heavily, by the end of the year I was already on around 10-12mg of klonopin ALMOST DAILY. When 2020 started I now started to take Xanax too, never went up on Xanax tho, it always remained almost the same dose (2mg, max 4) but maybe it was because I was always off klonopin, anyways it wasn‚Äôt until the last days of February when I decided that I wanted to stop doing benzos all of a sudden (never had withdrawals with any drug before), and it was a biiiiig mistake, of course I had no experience with coming off benzos since I was a practically new user, so I started to read forums and came on here to see what to expect & all that, I tried to make my own taper schedule which was a really bad idea since I was cutting my high dosage really really quick, I went through the withdrawals either way because I was just completely sure I wanted to cut them out and I wanted to do it fast and of course it didn‚Äôt work, so I decided to go to rehab to cut them out for good, and I went on March 18th, I did it cold turkey since my rehab didn‚Äôt use any meds to replace any drug usage, it was all natural, you have no idea what vitamins & minerals can really do, it was amazing, and it wasn‚Äôt really hard to be honest, I‚Äôve been completely off them for 6 months now and I feel amazing, benzos really fucking suck. Of course I do have my hard and easy days, just like any other but Ups and Downs, what life is about. 
Anyways, now that ya‚Äôll have my background, I‚Äôll just go to what any of you who read the title were wondering and waiting for. 
I had been smoking weed since I was 16 on a daily basis, never had any problem with it until benzos came into my life, when I stopped taking them I couldn‚Äôt even smoke because they would just trigger and intensify my anxiety and panic attacks even worse, so I stopped smoking completely also way before I went to rehab, the first time I tried to smoke again, I got AMAZINGLY high and of course that just made me a little anxious, but nothing else, now, I don‚Äôt smoke the same quantities and I don‚Äôt push myself to smoke A LOT, I just listen to what my body can manage and I‚Äôm fine with it, I think that‚Äôs essential for people who really want to take a toke every once in a while, also be aware of what could trigger your anxiety if you‚Äôre recent to being off Benzos and if you‚Äôre recent I wouldn‚Äôt even really recommend it, I‚Äôd just wait until you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre completely ready to take a toke so you don‚Äôt need to go through any ‚Äúbad trips‚Äù, you don‚Äôt want that & less after all the hell we‚Äôve all already been through.

So, I'm kinda just venting here I think, trying to look for some advice, I don't know. I guess I'm gonna tell my ""story"", and it might be long, so thanks for anyone reading.

I'm 23. It all started with lockdown (around May), boredom and the loneliness. Oh, and also the fact that I'm a fucking mess of anxiety overall. In the beginning, I was just buying some xans (all pharma), like 10 bars, and taking usually half a bar or a full one in weekends. I loved how they made me feel and be able to do things my anxiety would block me from. Also, weed was so much better. Then, when it was over, of course I bought more and more. Ended up using 30 bars (60mg) in a week 'cause I didn't even know I'd crash so hard after cold turkeying 'cause I ran out. God, the first few days were awful. Like probably one of the worst days I had this year, full blown panic attacks all the time, couldn't sleep for shit, just horrible overall. But I got through it in a few days.

Eventually, me messing with xans every once in a while led to me going to an actual psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with GAD and prescribed me lexapro and clonazepam. Of course I was only pumped for the benzo, so I ended up didn't even taking lexapro. I saw some shit saying it makes you more anxious in the beginning and I was already a fucking mess, so I was kinda scared of taking it. Anyways, she told me to take around 2mg - 3mg as needed. I had around 50mg per month. In the beginning, I was doing as she told me to and it was working really fine, but eventually I started dosing on more days, taking more and more for recreational purposes until I ran out before getting my next script. I was fine for the first week, but after that, dissociation and anxiety and depression all hit me pretty hard. I couldn't bother do shit all day, I just stayed in bed watching movies or tv shows and feeling really unmotivated.

Until I got my script again, which, honestly, I went through really fast. That was partly due to some problems regarding my father, which made me worried and even more anxious overall. So I figured I had a reason to be dosing so frequently. But of course it got out of control, even when things with my dad got better. So, basically since August 17 I've been dosing xanax or (mainly) clonazepam almost everyday. I am scared because my tolerance is through the roof. I have to take like 4mg to feel it. Sometimes I end up taking 6mg. I can go like two days max without taking them without things starting to go south for me, but the cravings are real. I don't know if I'm at the point of seizures if I were to cold tukey, but I'm really scared. I only have like 20mg of clonazepam left, and it's gonna take me a while to get my hands in some more of the stuff.

I just really needed to vent. I never thought I'd find myself in that situation. I feel so fucking stupid for falling into this addiction with all the warning I had. I just hope that shit doesn't end up killing me.

Thanks for anyone who took their time to read this. I really wish I didn't need to dose today, but I don't think it's gonna happen. :(",8,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46147823}"

(One doctor said I‚Äôm like a character in Apocalypse, Now - who simply has made a joyful home in the war he‚Äôs been in for 8 years.)
I am in the final weeks of 1.5 years of tapering. 
The last few weeks are very difficult. My skin is itchy and burning, my lungs are bad, heart is not beating correctly, my immune system is compromised so I should not go to a hospital. And, I am twitching. 

But, I demanding to keep going while the world is ending because that‚Äôs how I am. 
I woke up, didn‚Äôt know where I was and ejected myself across the room. This kind of PTSD is dangerous. I injure myself, often. I couldn‚Äôt find my dog. It was dark. I couldn‚Äôt find my husband. 
Normally, I might take a little extra benzo at this point, but I really don‚Äôt want to. 
However, I‚Äôm alone in my apartment, and I‚Äôm supposed to be quarantined. In an effort to locate myself, I opened the window.
Smoke came in my window and everything was orange. Orange. Bright orange. I screamed a lot.

I completely freaked out. (And, I‚Äôm a horror fan) 
I am not kidding I thought I‚Äôd died. I started taking pictures and texting them to everyone and making them answer questions about how they met me - to prove I wasn‚Äôt dead. I told my friends - they weren‚Äôt real - but part of my imagination.

Luckily, they all replied in horror and said the city was really orange. It was after noon and there was no sun, so it was dark (and that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt find my dog... she‚Äôs pitch black) 

But, only HERE -  I think will people understand:
 the world is CRAZY, but we‚Äôre STILL doing this. Benzo withdrawals are overpowering on their own. 

Add in the state of the world, the country. How are any of us even doing it? 

But, I realized I had NO PLAN for life throwing anything extra at me - because I‚Äôm booked for calamity appointments. I‚Äôve always been able to juggle an extreme about of craziness. 

THIS WAS A HUGE WAKE UP: I didn‚Äôt even think: on top of the Benzo taper, and not being able to go to a hospital (immune system-Staph), - deaths in the family, a PTSD attack may come along that could be met with something as insane as ‚Äî- everything actually being orange.

My go at creative writing about my addiction and how it started:

The bass speakers screech off at 2am. Molly is excited to go to the after party with me but I can tell she‚Äôs wearing down but we were going at it for hours dancing. 

Now I‚Äôm tired but idk how I‚Äôm going to sleep tonight. I can never sleep after being with Molly. 

Back at my place, another named Ben Zoe who knows Molly - and who doesn‚Äôt know her in this group of strangers in my own living space. 
Ben came up to me out of everyone and said, ‚Äútalk to my friend Xavier. Knows how to get rid of anxiety and put you to sleep since Molly is gone.‚Äù
Plagued by insomnia I followed him and when I met Xavier my life changed in an instant. 
Xavier turned. He was tall thin and handsome. Very well dressed in an all black casual suit.

‚ÄúMy friends call me X,‚Äù he said to me with a charming grin, holding out his hand to me. And I took it. Every shred of tension and anxiety and pain was slowly fading in that moment until I didn‚Äôt remember anything and drifting off to sleep. I woke up feeling like Xavier was a piece of heaven I‚Äôd been fortunate enough to meet. X was my heaven. 

We kept meeting. Usually when I needed him to comfort me from and anxiety attack or make me feel better after I threw up from ibs. He was always there to comfort me in a way no one else could. He helped me relax. I felt like a better me when he was around. I was in love. And there wasn‚Äôt a thing I wouldn‚Äôt do for X or to get more of X. 

Molly was around. I still cared about her but only if I got to see X after. I started to need X because I needed the peace and sleep he brought with his presence only. 

But he always left so soon. 

Such short visits of Xavier‚Äôs peace. ‚ÄúMaybe having him around so much is starting to become an issue,‚Äù I thought. Yet every time I asked him to leave me we were stuck like glue. I couldn‚Äôt get X away without losing a part of myself and maybe dying in the process. He didn‚Äôt tell me and claims he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know‚Äù. 

My body needed more of X to recover from panic attacks and to erase painful screen shot memories of my ex in bed with another woman.. blood dripping down my arms from cuts I put there myself.. my brother sexually exploiting me... they were coming back like they were happening. I screamed for Xavier, ‚ÄúHelp me please! I love you and you always help me.‚Äù 

X looked at me with the most blank stare - I‚Äôve never noticed how black his eyes were, ‚ÄúI was never meant to help for so long,‚Äù X said nonchalantly, continuing to stare; eyes getting darker. 

My heart was broken. I begged with X to let me go. He said, ‚ÄúI would but you‚Äôll be in terrible danger. You could have a seizure and die from that broken heart. Looks like ill have to stick around until you can get rid of me without that danger.‚Äù

It turns out I thought I could fix the pain that Xavier made worse with this girl I was introduced to by my psychiatrist Kloe Pin. ‚ÄúPeople call me K-Pin,‚Äù kloe said. she made me nervous but excited, ‚Äúyou can call me whatever you want.‚Äù and winked at me as I took her hand. She was really rather beautiful and I felt that feeling. THAT FEELING. The one that has haunted my nightmares since a child. All that faded the moment kloe and I touched. 

Kloe was a lot like X tho she didn‚Äôt fill the heartache always. I fell in love still. It wasn‚Äôt as passionate or intense as Xavier‚Äôs and my love, but she gave the comfort needed and she stuck around a little longer than X would. She would often tell me everything would be okay and would play with my hair as I drifted off to sleep. 

But then Kloe started to leave too soon. She would leave not long after showing up and when she was around I felt her presence less and less. I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. 

I see Kloe on a bench after hours of searching and panicking. What if I couldn‚Äôt find her?!? I finally see her across the way and run to her ‚ÄúK-Pin!!! I need you!!!! You can‚Äôt just disappear I was freezing out there without you!?!? Please hold my hand‚Äù She looked at me with hard eyes and black hair. She used to look to beautiful to me now she looked scary. She gripped my hand and grinned at me. Instead of butterflies at the sight of her I terrified. She leans in rough for a kiss and I am in blackness. 

Again. 

I wake up next to Kloe. we‚Äôre in a cell. I look over and see two other familiar faces. 
‚ÄúMolly?? Xavier???‚Äù I need to get out of this cell. I‚Äôm with everyone that ruined my life! GET ME OUT IF HERE!!! Molly giggles, and X smirks, ‚Äúthe only way out is to dig the tunnel,‚Äù he gestures to a shovel. 

‚ÄúYou got yourself here so now you have to get yourself out,‚Äù she toss the shovel at me. 
I have no energy and have no strength. I could give. I‚Äôd be digging my own grave. Well stuck in hell with ex lovers is sure to get me killed anyways.

 I could just stay here and let them take over... it‚Äôd be so nice not to grab the shovel... and now put in the work cause that hike is gonna take month off not years of daily work. X and K-Pin sometimes help shovel dirt when I‚Äôm about to pass out but other than that I keep my distance. They‚Äôre not to be trusted. The world is not to be trusted and if I‚Äôve learned anything from this cell is that once I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm gone for good. Idk if I can make it.  

Hell is a deep place to dig from. But is that light up wayyyy ahead? Or am I just about to pass out again? I‚Äôm not sure but it looked like a light from heaven. This time the real heaven awaits.",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.53350097}"

I want everyone, addicted or enabling, to truly understand what it‚Äôs like to watch someone they love die because of a drug. 
The conversation is too quiet, still. 

My Beautiful Sister...
I wake up today knowing that I have to say goodby to you. And I can't. These last few days haven't been real. I haven't really witnessed things that are going to change me for years to come. 
While trying to remake her face as I remember, I run my finger across her cheek ever so lightly. 
She isn't real anymore. 
I trace her beautiful, perfect lips; remembering the smiles and the laughs. The moments that were ours. 
Those damn eyelashes of hers. I try and do the separating thing with the straight -pin trick she had mastered. I poke her eye. Her lifeless eye. I scream, forgetting just what this was. The task of preparing the cocooned caterpillar into the beautiful butterfly that is finally free. 
I finish with shaking hands. The mortician inspects and approves. Phase two begins. 
He asks my mother a question that no mother who has just lost a child should be asked. 

‚ÄúWould you like to grab her legs and help me place her in the casket?"" 

She hesitates for the briefest of seconds before grabbing her daughters legs. Legs that are encased in a plastic body bag zipped up to her neck. 
Ever so gently, she places her down to sleep for the last time. I see the river of pain running from her eyes at the knowledge of what she had just done. From the cradle to the grave.
I watched my dad weep like a new widow. The pain in his tears was so heartbreaking because they told me what his words could not. Unable to be the hero he always had been. Just so unable this time. 
I look at these two little boys, knowing that their world -as her children- is essentially no more. Never again would they know her that way. 
Never again would they have the one thing that every child in this world wants most...
Their momma. 
A wiped tear from another would never do what their mothers touch did. 
See, she wasn't just this junkie...she was so, so much more. A daughter, a sister, a mother,  a friend.  She was SOMEONE to so many and Im going to put her back onto her pedestal where she belongs.

    To put you in a nutshell sis, you are what I always yearned to be. You were so beautiful and classy. Funny and ambitious. You could do anything, say anything. My admiration for you runs rather deep. I am so proud to be your sister! 
I loved your company and your humor. I loved your other side. The mischievous one. You were never afraid of anyone or anything. You always managed to make my day a little brighter, by being my personal silver lining.. 
Your love meant more to me than anything. Every moment of my life that included you, was so good. You radiated something that drew us near. All of us; like moths to the flame. 
I hope you know the impact you had. I hope you know you were an influence and my closest confidant. A sister that I held in the highest regard.
It brings me to my knees knowing I won't see you in the physical sense. Knowing that I have to learn to live a life without you in it. This void that‚Äôs left inside my heart is vast, a big piece died along with you.  
Please send me little signs of you. Let me think of you often, so I can laugh silently to myself. 
Play me a song in my head, so I‚Äôll remember the moment it was meant for. 
Let me recognize you in your children  from your traits and features that you passed on to them.
Let me never forget your face and the beauty that was you.

I hope you truly are at rest now. Free to be the person you were always meant to be. 
I know that every day must close, every dream must end and every bright light must burn out. Thank you beautiful sister for starting that fire with me, and watching it burn with me. Our embers will never die out. I'm sharing with God one of my most treasured gifts, and it would be my honor. For her honor.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6174644}"

I won‚Äôt bore with the stuff that‚Äôs irrelevant. Maybe someone can relate or be inspired to quit. I don‚Äôt know, but if I can do it, I believe anyone can.

My story started about 6-7 years ago when I first started working for a major pharmacy chain. I‚Äôve had insomnia all of my life but it was getting worse when I was stressed out about this new career. My doctor prescribed my klonopin and I couldn‚Äôt get enough. I was using 2mg a day for a few months. 

I worked for this retail pharmacy chain as a float. I had learned how to steal without getting caught. I won‚Äôt go into details. All that matters is that I had bottles of every kind of benzo, Everything except triazolam. So naturally I started taking more and more without any care. I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you how much of anything I was taking. I didn‚Äôt do it while I was working but as soon as I got out of work to catch the bus I started popping pills.

I never got caught but I eventually quit that job. Lots of reasons but regardless, I no longer had my endless supply. I started to ration it out more and then I turned to etizolaam, diclazepam and clonazolam. I went back to school to get a career in IT/networking. While I was working on my bachelors degree I eventually started to run out of places to get those rc benzos. I still had my rx for klonopin but it wasn‚Äôt enough to keep the anxiety away anymore. It was february of this year that it all started to fall apart.

I told my doctor everything and she agreed to help me get off of the drugs. She didn‚Äôt switch me to valium right away like I wanted and I seriously suffered cutting the klonopin down. 

I started my taper on 1mg klonopjn in february and
by July I was done with valium. switched to valium 5mg in april and just went down every week. I was in so much pain I didn‚Äôt want to go through it anymore. I was suicidal and depressed. I lost my job and everything just went down hill.

I went through every possible withdrawal effect. I lost control of my eyelids, couldn‚Äôt even keep them closed. I couldn‚Äôt breathe through my nose, I was having severe facial spasms, extreme insomnia, night sweats, depersonalization, hallucinations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, neuralgia and neuropathy...

the worst being that I developed ‚Äúpainful bladder syndrome‚Äù and IBS. my body basically became allergic to certain foods and drinks that never bothered me before. I was having painful urinations, burning in my bladder, uncontrollable urges to urinate... as the months went on this has become less extreme but it‚Äôs still there. Something I‚Äôve got to live with now.


Wasn‚Äôt expecting to develop painful bladder syndrome at all, I was more prepared to go through the mental bullshit and neuralgia. Well I got it all and then some. Does that make me regret quitting? no, not at all. I regret ever starting. I have no one to blame but myself. I could blame my doctor but I‚Äôm also to blame. I‚Äôve been prescribed tons of stuff I passed on because it seemed like a bad idea, this one was just too enticing to pass up. 

I‚Äôm doing better now and I‚Äôm officially off for good now. It‚Äôs been about a month that I haven‚Äôt taken anything, and I‚Äôm still feeling the increased anxiety but it‚Äôs been getting weaker as the days go on. 

I don‚Äôt want anyone to read this and think the worst will happen to them, what happened to me isn‚Äôt common but I have talked to others here that went through something similar. I hope someone sees it and decides to quit because of it though. the longer you do it the more chance you have of fucking up your body. just dont fucking do it.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47019058}"

I underwent an extremely rapid Clonopin taper a few weeks ago and of course was left with the postacute hypervigilance, insomnia, and rebound anxiety.

I have slipped a couple times since. I then heard people singing praises about Norflurazapam because of its long half-life and it being volumetrically tapered. 

I took one single-dose of the Norf about a week ago and it honestly was the first time I felt normal in ages. I either haven‚Äôt really started coming down yet from it and am only experiencing some mild discomfort... I know the half-life is like 200 hours so I‚Äôm trying to wait and find out if I am going to experience a withdrawal from it....  if something has a really long half-life does that make it more likely to experience a withdrawal from a single use? Granted, I wasn‚Äôt off the klonopin for long beforehand.

I am wondering if there‚Äôs anyone here who has had success using the strategy to get back to baseline. I was wondering if my logic with sound by taking it in Post-acute in hopes of having a softer landing. For all I know, I undid all
My healing and I‚Äôm in for CT wd all
Over again.

If you did experience success, what was your taper schedule like? How often did you drop and what was your dosage like?

If you experienced failure, please share your warnings. I know it acts on gaba-b which can produce horrific terror withdrawals so I‚Äôm wary of that.

Or tell me the truth if it doesn‚Äôt. But I feel it will. 

  If you wanna know what I was on just go to my page and read the titles it explains my journey. I can‚Äôt wait for my cognitive abilities to come back too. And the mini seizures to go away. I am tired.. I will mention I‚Äôve been a daily benzo user for close to 9 months now. I was on up to 12mg flualp a day just 5ish months ago, then got to 8mg and now I‚Äôm finally at script .5mg and 20mg valium a day. Next step is letting go of the .5mg Xanax and tapering off just valium from there. Yes I‚Äôm working with a great psych doctor. 

  It is what is is I guess right now haha.. I feel like everyone hates me. Even though I know that‚Äôs not true and the people around me love me. Everything around me overwhelms me and I feel so self absorbed in my own self. Constantly breaking down. I‚Äôm tired of being helped too I feel guilty. Everyone having to remind me to eat and cooking my meals and driving me places when I‚Äôm not having a ‚Äògood day‚Äô in the taper. They‚Äôre all bad days with a few good moments but constant physical pain and tension. Used to the pain and tension. The emotional kills me though.

  Everyone says I‚Äôm not a burden. I can‚Äôt wait for this to be over. I‚Äôve lost 8-10lbs since I started tapering 3 months ago thankfully I‚Äôve gained half of it back. I was only 102lbs to begin with. I‚Äôve almost died during this process. Sometimes I feel barely alive I‚Äôm surprised my body can handle this. Sometimes it feels it‚Äôs just gonna give out.

  I‚Äôm an artist full time and I can‚Äôt even paint and cognitively I‚Äôm not as good now because of how my brain is all mushy and forgetting stuff. I wanna paint and go outside and do stuff it‚Äôs so hard to get up I feel I‚Äôm gonna faint.

  I just want it to end. I have a bit of a ways to go though. Benzos are the devil I want my life back :( or what I hope is a life after this I don‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôm so sad I did this. But I had a nervous breakdown after I left my abusive ex who also put my dog down and moved in a new girlfriend and all her animals within 3 weeks of meeting her. And they both harrasaed me and threw out all my stuff. I could barely function after all the physical and emotional abuse. And that‚Äôs how benzos started for me. Anyways that‚Äôs my vent.

Just gotta let the madness go mad inside and just let it be, stop trying to control it, cuz that makes it worse. Just let myself feel like absolute shit.

It said that initial symptoms started during the 1st day and peaked at week 2 before subsiding. My doc never told me about this, of course... 

I have chronic pain and the clonz help me space out my pain med doses a bit. Was wondering if I took between 12-18mg of clonz a day for 3 days each, would taking a 7 day break give me enough time to get it out of my system, or will I have to wait 2-3 weeks according to the graphic? I'm not sure if the withdrawals are reflective of the stuff still being in your system and whether taking anything during those 2-3 weeks will put me back on day 1 of the withdrawals. I haven't found any info on this and the benzo subreddit was of no help and some of those people kept assuming things about me that weren't true for some strange reason... Could really use some advice. I've done this successfully for some weeks, but took a 3 week long break just in case after doing this 3 times and waiting a week before doing the 3 days again. 

It seems to work for me and I've never been an addict, but I'm just looking for some more advice that's helpful and not random assumptions. I'm desperate to lower my tolerance to my pain meds and the clonz seem to be the only thing that help me a little. How long of a break would I need, ideally, to remove or minimize withdrawals while still getting the benefit I desperately need.

i was on ~50mg of valium a day for 4 years. i am now about 10 months sober from it and i thought you guys deserved a check in with how much my symptoms have changed since then.

firstly, i really do consider myself lucky. i would say that most if not all of my post acute symptoms are gone. the only thing that lingered was the OCD, namely the health anxiety involved with it. it is definitely getting easier though. 

no more panic attacks for no reason. no more random episodes of high blood pressure and racing heart. no more brain zaps. all of the physical symptoms are officially out the door, and have been for a few months now. i am no longer depressed either. 

i think im through this guys. like done done. i just want to say that if you feel like you‚Äôre doomed or hopeless, if you feel like surely you will be fucked up for years and years from this, just know that it‚Äôs gonna get better. you can find a new normal that works for you. you may actually find yourself having a good time after a while. don‚Äôt be afraid to enjoy the little things, take it day bu day, minute by minute if you have to. just keep getting through it, i know you can.

I decided that 2020 would be my last year on the horrible benzo treadmill, 1mg daily, sometimes an extra .50mg depending. The taper started late January, .25mg at a time. I figured 4 months, I'd be done and dusted. 

When the lock down hit, my anxiety etc. went into over drive and the temptation was strong to go back to a full dose of my evil enemy. I resisted, and here I am, 12/14 weeks benzo free since the end of May. I can't exactly remember the date, benzo brain fog was in full swing then. 

The insomnia, brain zaps, twitches, and of course, anxiety were my constant companions. It was very upsetting and horrible.
My next challenge is to not renew my prescription, to add to my stockpile. I didn't order them this month, and I feel panic setting in, but again, with your help, I shall do my darnedest to stay the course.

Didn‚Äôt even measure my volumes that accurately.

So I‚Äôve been daily dependent on etizolam for a year now.

Started off at 1mg per day but slowly over time just started upping my dose while also having some bouts of tapering. Can‚Äôt even remember anymore.

It really got out of control during quarantine. Started mixing benzos too like flualprazolam, xanax, and diclazepam.

Over the period of like 6 months I had grown my dependency and tolerance to like 10mg etiz/day.

First step was just sticking to etizolam and stabilizing on 10mg. 

That was a step in the right direction.

And then over the last two months I‚Äôve been tapering by dropping 1mg every 2-3 weeks. Depending on how I was feeling.

Well I made it to 4mg/day. 1mg in the morning, 3 at night.

But last week I just needed some serious sleep. I hadn‚Äôt been sleeping well (not due to withdrawals, but due to life stresses that would keep me up at night). So I took a reasonable dose of diclazepam (I think 2mg) along with my normal 3mg etiz. I didn‚Äôt feel guilty about it. It‚Äôs just something I needed to do.

But tonight, fuck me, I‚Äôm so disappointed. Tonight I just needed to get high and eat a bunch of junk food

I came off about 4 years ago I was using about 1.5 mg clonazpam aday for about 1 year prescribed, I tried to cold turkey I tried to taper fast I tried a lot of things nothing worked until I did a lot of research on how the stuff fully effects the brain. I switched to diazepam BUT instead of using the equivalent dosage calculator I actually used about 5 mg more diazepam than I needed to thus I was getting high, I felt great I then proceeded To lower the dose by a mg a month 20 mg to 10 was easy some parts were hard but because the drops we‚Äôre so low I only felt uncomfortable for a day or 2 then I was fully functional again, never add an SSRI into a benzo  taper it could make it a whole heap worse, if you start feeling shit just stabilise on a dose for a longer period of time. It got to the point we‚Äôre the drops were so unnoticeable I‚Äôd forget to take it. This is just my experience

Don‚Äôt rush the taper you‚Äôll give yourself brain damage and ptsd from the panic attacks and fucked up withdrawals lol serious most of you will already know most of the stuff I‚Äôm telling you but yeah finding a doctor who will listen to you is hard. 

After I dropped the dose from one mg to zero I noticed Zero withdrawal from the drop and I mean zero. My anxiety disappeared and it was almost like staying on benzos that long and tapering off that long reset my whole cns system prior to benzos I had really bad anxiety not depression tho just anxiety. It‚Äôs almost as if the slow taper healed my brain üòÇüòÇ 

I was also running a lot of nootropics and human growth hormone, testosterone and I managed to get a degree and work the whole way through the taper. I think I big part of it was starting at a dose you get HIGH off the reducing from there and you NEED diazpam 

Sadly I fucked up big time due to ending up in prison coming out end of last year and just losing total control of my life painkillers and then started dabbling with benzos and was taking ridiculous amounts for about 3 months not because I had anxiety more of an escape from boredom I‚Äôm deep in the rabbit hole at the moment I‚Äôm stable on 15 mg diazepam i don‚Äôreally plan on doing as slow of a taper but yeah that‚Äôs my story I‚Äôm basically posting this to motivate myself and you guys

Trust me it‚Äôs not impossible I‚Äôm not even scared I‚Äôm just pissed at myself because it‚Äôs such a long process but I feel sorry for those of you who must CT or fast taper I feel for you dm me if you need advice

And don‚Äôt use gabapentin ect ect it just complicates things though if you are already on it come off of it whilst on a higher dose of benzos pick one poison and don‚Äôt rush

You gotta have some serious willpower and determination to get through it.. and I really didn‚Äôt think I would. The feeling of taking a benzo and feeling all your anxiety melt away is addictive. I started to notice myself needing more and more and despite only taking it for 9 months it wreaked havoc on my body when it came time to stop it.

The problem is, I feel worse when I take it every day now. You know how Xanax has a short half life, well for the 6 hours after I take it I feel like shit. Once it wears off, I feel better. Not perfect, I have brain fog mainly, but a lot better. It almost makes me scared to taper, because taking the medicine at all now makes me feel so much worse. I just want to know if I could have a seizure this far out? Never had any issues of that sort before. I have spent every day waiting until midnight, where I get a window of a few hours that I feel perfectly fine.

I started taking benzos (xanax and kpins) since lockdown started around here (end of April, I think). I didn't take them every single day, but would go on week long binges, then give it a break for almost a month, then binge again and so it goes. 

Right now, I've been taking either kpins or xanax (2-4mg) since 17/08, skipping some days here and there. I want to stop using this shit but it just makes me feel so fucking good. It makes me able to do everything my anxiety blocks me from. Makes me able to talk to people like I never could when sober. I'm a better person overall when I'm off some benzos, my own grandpa noticed that I started talking to him more and being more calm and happy since I started getting my prescription.

But it's unsustainable. I don't get enough for it to be. I'm only prescribed clonazepam, I get my xans from another source. I usually take clonazepam when needed, as prescribed, but lately (mainly because of lockdown and I can't do shit besides being in my room) I've been needing it a lot. There were also some family issues that contributed to that.

Ran out of xans, so now I only have like 15mg of clonazepam and I'm slowly starting to freak out. I feel just fine if I go a day or two without taking it, but more than that and things go south. I start feeling like shit, can't get off my bed to do anything. Don't have energy to talk to people I want to talk to. But I think the worse is the dissociation. I just feel like there's something off with reality, fuck this feeling.

Anyways, as I said, I guess that's just me venting. I'm gonna try and get an appointment with my psychiatrist earlier than we scheduled it (mid october) since my stuff won't last. And then, I need plan my way out of these meds.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm 22 years old. Throughout 2015-2017 I was a drugged out mess. Doing tons of cocaine, alcohol, adderall, and my favorite drug Xanax. I was taking an insane amount of Xanax around that time that ruined many relationships and I even got a DUI right after I turned 18 while driving on Xanax and crashing into a street pole. Late 2017- early 2018, I got my shit together 100%. Had a very solid job, got super into working out and eating healthy and looked great, I even started college and am now and am
doing great in school (I even made the deans list) on my way to getting my bachelors and hopefully my masters. Which is such a turn around for me because I did awful in school my whole life, I even got kicked out halfway through my senior year and ended up graduating from a continuation school. But in early 2019, I was sick one week, I woke up one morning that week and was having the most insane chest pains ever. They would not go away, so I went to the ER. They took my blood and my Troponin levels were at 2.7, they were thinking I had a heart attack but at the same time they were saying that‚Äôs basically impossible due to my age. They ended up doing a cardiac catheterization surgery that day to check my arteries out, which looked fine. Upon more tests, they found out my heart was only working at 30% horsepower, I was emitted to the fourth floor of the hospital (the cardiac unit) and all the nurses were saying I was the youngest person who was ever up there. I ended up being diagnosed that day with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. They told me I was never gonna be able to work out again (which was a major part of my life and sobriety) and also insinuated that they‚Äôre not sure how much longer I have to live, so you can imagine how this made me feel. That whole next month I started having chest pains and went back to the ER multiple times, turns out they were just panic attacks (chest pain caused the panic attacks because it was just like how it felt before). So, to combat the panic attacks, after about a year and a half of sobriety from Xanax, I had to be actually be prescribed Xanax to combat my panic attacks and severe anxiety due to all this. Luckily, by the grace of god, after being on heart medication and bed rest for a little over a month, it turns out that I was misdiagnosed, and I actually had a rare heart virus called myocarditis. By the grace of god, I had recovered. After all this, I realized after a year of not going out or partying or anything, that life is too short and I got back into it. Going out and partying, doing cocaine alcohol to ketamine was very common on the weekends. I‚Äôm trying to slow down with that at this point and am doing a good job, my school work and amazing girlfriend kind of keep me in check. But, I have been on Xanax since then due to my panic attacks that I still frequently have, I have trouble breathing to due to my anxiety, and Xanax is the only thing that works to stop it. I have my life completely together, but I‚Äôm still taking Xanax and increasing my dose, I‚Äôm in a very blurred line in weather I actually need it or not, you can imagine how this makes me feel after being sober from it for so long to actually ‚Äúneeding it‚Äù. I‚Äôm taking NO WHERE NEAR as I was back then, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I still work out all the time and in great shape, and doing amazing in school, but since the incident with my heart, anxiety and panic attacks have taken over my life, and I hide it very well from friends. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

So at 14(22 now)I was prescribed Xanax 1mg 3 times a day. Did that daily until about age 20. I‚Äôd long been noticing the effects of simply missing a pill. Then I went down to 2 a day. Then by December of age 21 I was down to .5 mg a day. Coupled with stress from having a child soon and other things I ended up getting back up to 1 mg a day. 0.5 am and pm. Then all of a sudden I felt extreme panic as if the meds weren‚Äôt working.  Every symptom in the book

I had been cut off (issues with insurance company) at age 20. The pills I was taking were over a year old at this point. I was getting them from a family member who never took them. I haven‚Äôt felt right since. I got the shakes, I was hot and cold at the same time. I couldn‚Äôt eat or drink without having a panic attack or just function for that matter. Constant world ending thoughts, sounds threw me for a loop and I lost 30 lbs in 21 days I couldn‚Äôt do anything everything though me into a panic attack. Fast forward to the end of February I haven‚Äôt left my house in 2 months shit is just not getting better. I was taken 12 showers a day and shaking violently. 

I finally got to a doctor in may and was heard out. I never really abused them just took my exact dosage every day. He prescribed me .05 mg.  I took it for a few weeks and still did not feel any better. Then things started to look up. I now take 0.5 mg in total a day. I break it up into quarters then break the quarters into almost quarters. 

I guess what I am asking is, I am on month 9 of this shit. I‚Äôve been back to work since mid June and able to drive again. I have gained little weight and still cannot drink anything other than water. I can eat now though. I still can‚Äôt enjoy a beer or anything like that. 

I feel like I am getting better but with rough patches. I just feel like it‚Äôs going at an abysmal rate. Is 8 years of heavy(ish) use link to going on 9 months of feeing off? Blurry vision, anxious spikes, burning sensation etc. litterally everything makes me anxious and uncomfortable. 

I just hope I‚Äôm making progress and not stuck in this, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda better and can do more things but still can‚Äôt enjoy life‚Äù phase.

I was able to get through it though and after which I developed an extreme cause of generalized anxiety and panic disorder and also what I would call health anxiety. I went through a multitude of tests, had x-rays done multiple times ct scans with contrast and without, had an echo done on my heart and ultrasounds done on my kidneys and even wore a heart monitor for 14 days. Everything checked out fine and i was thus left with anxiety as the ""only"" thing that was wrong 

I was around that time put on 1MG of lorazepam to be taken up to 3 times daily. I think I might have taken it like that for the first week at most. I then went down to just taking it as 1 Mg per day. Over the next month or so my anxiety started to improve, I was also put on buspar taking 2.5 mg in the morning and at night.  

It continued to improve so I eventually reduced my dose to 0.5 MG twice a day and then I started to cut up the 0.5 MG and take 0.25 MG 3 times a day. I eventually cut that back to two times a day then once a day.

This past Saturday I decided that I would go from 0.25 MG once per day to 0.25 MG once every other day and I have started to get anxiety back on a pretty significant level. Constant cold chills and shaking and general nervousness all over my body that doesn't really ever go away. 

I'm wondering if this could be a result in taking this medicine so long? Or it perhaps the buspar isn't working anymore? 

Anything information would be greatly appreciated!
