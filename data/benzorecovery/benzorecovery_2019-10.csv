I am here to ask for help... I have been using Diazepam for about 1 year.

I was benzo free for about two months after tapering off to 0mg.

I relapsed 4 weeks ago and used high doses of Oxazepam. I had to quit cold turkey because I ran out off my pills. 

I don't want to touch any benzodiazepine again. I was prescribed it for GAD.

It's about one week that I'm sober.
But it's mentally and physically like hell.

I can't sleep.
I can't get out of bed to do normal tasks like washing dishes or cleaning my apartment because I have zero energy.
I have anxiety attacks which are extremely frightening.
I can't leave my room because literally EVERYTHING causes panic/anxiety.
My hands are shaking.
I absolutely have no control about anything.
I can't work.
I can't eat.
I can't stand any noises or any light.
I'm totally isolated and I don't know when this pain is going to end.

My doctor prescribed me Zoloft, Promethazine, Pregabalin and Amitryptilin to get through it. But it does not help at all.

I don't know what to do. I have no control about my anxiety and depression…

I'm 24 years old and I'm afraid to die in this state.
Can you give me advices and kind words because for me my world is full of irrational anxiety. And I can't do anything. I can't get out because of the fear to have a panic attack.",4

It’s all out of his body now but He’s supposed to be going for a trip at the end of next month to see his dad and doesn’t want to feel suicidal and depressed like this, I’m guessing it’s from these new meds along with his body recovering, but he can’t do anything for himself right now and even wanted me to kill him because he feels so useless, I can’t stand to see him like this but I’m at his side every second he needs, so my question is how long does this last considering it’s pretty short term use? Is there any supplements he could/should be taking?",2

It worked like a charm. Seemed to solve all of my problems at once. But we all know that never lasts, so I decided to quit. I tapered to zero over six months or so, and told my doc to remove the med from my list so I can't order refills. I had 60mgs left, so I figure I would have some for emergencies in the future. This was about six months ago.

Fast forward to a month ago and I'm using .5mgpd to help get off of opioids (opium and kratom). At most I used 1mg a night, but only a few times. This lasted maybe three weeks. 

I quit the opioids, then two weeks later, quit the Xanax. The opioid withdrawals were gone when I quit, but then suddenly I'm back to insomnia and severe digestive issues. Nausea and endless diarrhea for over a week. As an experiment, I take a full dose of opium and the problems did not go away. At all. I've never had diarrhea on opioids before and didn't think is was even physically possible... So the next night (two nights ago) I take .5mg of Xanax and my stomach goes back to normal and I sleep like a baby. Last night was rough, and today I'm back to endless diarrhea. And crazy restless sleep too. Like flailing myself awake. I don't understand how such a short and low dose of Xanax can do this to me. Does this seem normal? Or could there be something else I'm missing? Could my previous dependence be causing this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2

Why is their cop out always inpatient treatment centers even after I tell them they don’t taper slow enough to make an iota of difference.

Why even if they do believe me feel disrespected because I KNOW what I need and it’s not any diagnosis they may or may not come up with. I just need their cooperation and open mindedness to REALLY understand that they extremely underestimate the misery I’m going through by default.

More recently I’m having small periods of feeling ok and then seem to go backwards.

My question is would I have healed at all during that six months off benzos with continuing to drink or will I have just made it worse?,2

2019-10-27 11:21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/dnurlm/glycine_helped_me_quit_7_years_of_klonopin_use/,Glycine helped me quit 7+ years of Klonopin use,"I'll try and be brief. Basically, I took Klonopin for about 7 years, was prescribed for general anxiety and not to exceed a couple weeks usage -- of course you already know how that went. Anyway, throughout the years I made 3 attempts to withdraw by tapering doses, but I always wound up back at square one. I had a host of awful and scary symptoms on those attempts, the most unsettling were jerking pains in my heart that literally felt life-threatening. 

Fast forward to early 2017 when I was looking for something to help with sleep and I came across glycine. I felt desirable effects from it regarding sleep and anxiety, so I just kept taking it daily in the morning and at night, without thinking much of it. Soon I started to notice that my body seemed to care a whole lot less over whether I was taking my Klonopin regularly or not. Whereas before my body was reminding me like ""Hey, I need some benzos down here STAT or I'm going to wreck your life""; now it seemed to be more like ""Meh, okay."" So I went into my 4th and final taper -- this one went off with kind of a whimper. I would take both things alternately or concurrently and do it kind of on feel, always aiming to reduce my Klonopin intake, sometimes I'd feel the need to take Klonopin and I would take Klonopin, other times I would feel the same need and take glycine instead. I played it by ear with the ultimate target being the overall reduction of Klonopin intake.

I don't want to make it sound too easy, but it really felt like before glycine my body NEEDED whatever receptor binding the Klonopin was doing, and after being on glycine for many months it just seemed like it had stocked up on something deficient and the Klonopin was just more fuel to my body -- like one was diesel and the other was kerosene, but my car could run on either one -- to an extent (it's not magic either, I still had some growing pains). So, I tapered and really haven't had any trouble since. This was probably around December 2017. I kept taking the glycine once I was finished with the Klonopin. Around April 2018 I decided to quit taking the glycine too, and I was morbidly curious whether it was going to cause a withdrawal of its own, but as it turns out, glycine was something I could essentially quit from one day to the next. 

Somewhere along the line, I was talking with a friend who had been on Xanax for over 10 years. I told him about the glycine thing with all the caveats -- like ""Dude, I don't know if this is going to help anyone else, but here's what happened to me..."" and so I sent him home with a Ziplock baggie of the powder. He was able to taper from 2 mg down to 0.5 mg in a month or two, and he wound up tapering fully as well.

I don't want to be on here touting some miracle cure, I don't know if it's going to work for anyone else -- I have a sample size of exactly two. But I also wouldn't feel right about not sharing this information on the off chance that it might actually help someone else. 

Glycine is cheap and can be bought anywhere, and brings just about zero risk with it. Would be cool if anyone who tries it out, whether they're successful or unsuccessful, posts about it for the benefit of others. 

I guess Ask Me Anything.",17

I think I discovered Xanax about 7 months ago. I started using it every 3/4 days at first with doses of around 2 mg. I don’t have one single memory of being fully relaxed on Xanax but plenty of times where I’ve blacked out. However for some reason, it was like my mind kept wanting to go back too it. I used it too be able to trip and smoke weed (couldn’t do either sober due to GAD) and had a few really nice times. 

For about 3 months or so I would take Xanax (doses rising up to 6mg) in the evening 1/2 times a week. This then became 2/3 times a week but I kept it so I could convince myself I after a couple of days that I was clear of withdrawals and endulge again. Anyway, this went on for a few months until I finally found myself taking it two days in a row and feeling like absolute shit the next day. I would then stay off the Xanax, work out and get myself to a point where I thought I was clear of withdrawals again (I’m aware this could have been very niave of me). 

After a specific incident of taking somewhere between 4-8mg (was powder so wasn’t sure), blacking out and my parents coming home, we all agreed that I needed some help. I had a plan from this point to go sober off everything and taper of with 2mg valiums from the doctors. I did this for about two weeks and then when I thought I had stabilised again, jumped back into the Xanax hellhole (although I thought I had more control of it this time). 

This then repeated a second time, having to admit to the gp I had been abusing Xanax again and getting another script for valiums (I was very responsible with how I tapered down and never once took a big dose for recreation). I then got off and decided that I was just going to take 10/20mg doses for social events etc. (I got more into Valium because I convinced myself it was less harsh withdrawals and less damaging in ways. I stopped using Xanax almost completely) This went alright until recently when I lost control again. 

In the past 2/3 weeks I think I have taken 20-50mg every day or other day in the evenings. I also came across k pins and had a couple days with 2mg doses of them. I loved valiums and they were allowing me to go out with my friends, drink and smoke like I wasn’t able too before due to my anxiety. 

I’m gonna wrap it up now.... for the last 3/4 days I have been stuck on 10mg Valium in the evening and am terrified to miss the dose. I spend the morning and afternoon anxious to the point of feeling sick until I take my dose and the anxiety becomes more bareable (still pretty bad). I want to come off them but I only have 10mg tablets and there’s a chance I may run out at some point. I have no idea how to cut them into the 2mg that my doctor had previously given me and I’m too embarrassed to ask for their help again. I don’t know whether switching to 5mg in the morning and 5mg in the evening will help me taper off or not. Can I drop straight down to 5mg and just bare the anxiety or is that dangerous/likely to be extremely uncomfortable for me? I am planning on just taking 5mg tonight and see how I feel. 

I just want to know, how far do you guys think I am down the rabbit hole? Is this an easy exit or am I looking at tapering down for months? I’ve done a hell of a lot of benzos over the last few months but with breaks every so often and tapers a couple times. Ask me any questions if you feel that There’s some information that could help you inform me. 

I really hope people take the time to read this and offer some advice. I love benzos and I hate benzos, they allow me to live a normal life but destroy my natural self. Thanks guys :(",2

2019-10-26 02:12:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/dna17a/how_to_start_this_taper/,How to start this taper?,"Hi there, well long story short. I am on 10mg valium and 1mg kpin. Valium started first and used for sleep problems. Then 1mg added to get through anxious and stressful days. Valium 12months, kpin 8 months. 

Tried taper benzos off it in march using lyrica (psych doc) but i got addicted to that too with terrible sides: memory, cognitive issues, balance, intestines, tinnitus. After only few weeks. So without increasing my benzo dose (they do f*k all to lyrica wd's anyway) i did water titration lyrica. 10 weeks on - 10 weeks taper to remain functional, go work, pay bills. Lyrica wd's are hell but i pushed through it. Memory improved tinnitus gone but this crap left me with deeeeep depresion. Was using kratom on and off to push through this continuous shit feeling, eventually got addicted using 3-4xweek at 3-4g. Quit that and pushed through wd's only increasing benzo couple times. (Was on kratom 2 months). Now post-k depression slowly wears off so im getting for the biggest challenge - benzo taper.

After having so bad experience with lyrica and kratom i am going to taper slowly, eat good (low carb), exercise. No more any substances, maybe cbd oil + supplements but not trading addictions and stuff.

My question is - is that good idea to taper 10 mg valium first, then switch 0.5 kpin to 10mg valium and taper and finally switch last 0.5mg kpin? I dont want full switch and having 30mg valium to start from. Or is it better to stay on valium and taper kpin (i know how to liquid taper since lyrica expierience)? Which way would be better in your opinion?

Im at the uni i dont want other medications that may affect my ability to learn that are used to assist benzo taper. I got 50-60% memory back after lyrica and kratom (im only 10 days off kratom) so hope the brain fog wears off soon. 

Sorry for long post, sometimes i feel like im in tolerance withdrawals. Dont ever use lyrica to ease benzo taper, this stuff did more damage than benzos in much shorter time.

Thanks for reading (english is not my 1st language and i hope you got my point).",2

I used to be a wine guy (and beer) but about 3 years ago I quit wine after too many problematic episodes. Now though, I just love a STRONG IPA or 3/4/5, and it's really starting to wear me down. I am also prescribed 10mg diazepam daily for severe anxiety, which I have recently (over the last 12 months or so) have been taking along with the daily drinking. I WANT TO STOP DRINKING AND TAKING THESE SHITTY TABLETS. I know that, or at least cut it ALL down OVER TIME ie taper etc of both.

I probably need to state here that my wife has recently been diagnosed with a brain tumour, and has decided on a natural approach including big diet changes, cbd oil, iv vitamin c and hyperbaric pressure treatments etc, and here I am still in the same if not worse state than when this all started. A mess. I have 2 beautiful, blossoming son's one 9 and one just 2 years old...

Her naturopath (that I was convinced to see) said that in situations like this (tumour / cancer) that the partner / husband may bear the brunt of the psychological pressure, worry and stress when a person is trying to do a complete health reboot after diagnosis, instead of surgery etc. And yep, that's what is happening here.

It effects so many parts of my life, I see it but can't seem to go a day without the booze or Valium in trying to quell my mental dislocation.

I'm just not sure how to tackle this huge issue (also feel terribly alone and weak right now).

Online advice tells me to keep using the Valium, maybe slightly tapered to get off the booze, but unfortunately when I look at it I've tried but not succeeded at all. I'll usually just either drink more if I only have 1 5mg, or take 10-15mg if I'm 'trying to be good' by only having 1 or 2 beers a night. Lose / Lose situation > dead end.

Today I did my usual thing of meaning the best, and actually earlier on visualising my day without  a beer, but as usual again I made my way to the bar with my sushi lunch and ordered a pot of 6.9% beer. I then came home all the while feeling super guilty for sneaking the drink in and proceeded to lose my tobacco which in turn caused a major melt down until I eventually found it. Hence I have just taken 15mg (5 more than usual and my largest dose for ages) diazepam to calm myself down. I also know that later today at some point the notion or idea that drinking beer is the right idea will also crop up, and that I will somehow work out a way of getting it, and drinking more.

Sorry for the super long post, and I'm not sure what I am asking here, and hope it's all legit for the group etc but I defo need some help. I'm wondering if AA or proper detox (out/in patient) is the answer as psychologists don't work for me and I've been through the wringer with ssri's, xanax and other harder drugs for years and years (dj life, nightclubs, bars and parties. Booze and drugs every weekend). 

I'm clean of all that other stuff (except the mushroom) now but these two, alcohol and diazepam seem to be slowly killing me inside somehow :(

Here's to a possible left turn soon, just reaching out cos the sidebar says so..

All the best,

From what I’ve read, I’ve been fortunate to be able to keep my dose relatively low but I understand that coming off at any dose is not going to be pleasant. 

I’ve lost hope in the advice from doctors and “medical experts” as most of them do not understand understand even a fraction of the risks associated with benzodiazepines.

So I’m going to try the Ashton Manual this time and if I’m cutting to much, I may start cutting micrograms instead of mg’s. 

My question is for those who has tapered before using this or a similar method. In the past I’ve always tried to eye-ball what I was cutting but I would like a more precise measurement. I’ve seen milligram scales on amazon and was wondering if anyone has used these scales. Also, I would assume that crushing the pill for measurement wouldn’t be too effective considering it would get in the system quick but at the same time, I’m not sure if Klonopin would do that considering how quickly it works in pill form. 

Has anyone used these scales for tapering or is it not worth it?

I'm posting this because I want anyone reading to know that it gets better. That folks who have recovered actually exist and are living happy healthy lives.

I'll spare you the long story but November 2013 I was taking 6mg/alprazolam a day (illicitly, not prescribed) and it barely phased me. That's not normal. 2mg alprazolam would result in an 12+hr nap for most. And a person doesn't get to that place overnight, it's a journey. 

When I recognized how obscene that dose was, I knew I had to stop.  It took me 3 or 4 tries to find a psychiatrist who also recognized the extreme severity of the situation. He was all about tapering but wanted to do it way too aggressively. I tried getting him to do the Ashton thing a few times and it got to the point I told him ""I have no hope right now and if I walk out that door hopeless today, killing myself is my only escape from this living hell."" 

From November 2013 to November 2018, I tapered from 5mg to 0mg of clonazepam. Maybe I could have been more aggressive and done it quicker but... I'm benzo-free and mostly symptom free today so that's the important part. 

The key to my success is my psychiatrist. We have an honest relationship based in mutual respect. We developed my treatment plan together, it was never ""here's what I'm making you do."" Also, we had clearly established that my usage of benzos was not helping me in any way and that benzo-free was the best route for me. 

I'll be celebrating 1 year here soon and life is good. I still smoke a fair amount of weed and take LSD every few months as the anti-depressant effects stick around longer after the drugs wear off. 

Something I thought would be good - a directory of patient-endorsed benzo-aware doctors. It seems one of the biggest problems getting treated for benzo dependence is finding a clueful doctor who doesn't think they're god. I've recommended my psych to a number of people in my area. 

TLDR: Abused xanax to the point of addiction, kind and clueful doc helped me taper, life is good and my brain works again.",27

I have posted before in here and think I am finally in the position to say I am ready to be done with Benzos once and for all. My story...

Started clonazepam 2 years ago, took infrequently, 1-2 times a week, @ dosages of 1-2 mg each time. This held steady for about a year, then my psych provided me with more pills, and as one would guess my usage went up. In the last year : 

Initial 6 months-used about twice a week, sometimes 3 times, 2-4 mg each time.

last 6 months : Usage became an issue. I was only issued 25 mg A MONTH, but would blow through it in 4 or 5 days. 

Last dose : 2 mg 6 days ago. I now realize what caused me to use this dose wasn't really stress, but drawn out with draw symptoms.

How I feel is best summed up by simply saying its like I am perpetually hung over, feel like I have ""sea legs"" at times, tired, have to force feed myself, but have been able to. I have felt like crap but have been going to work, sleeping OK at night, and still going to the gym. In fact it seems like being in the gym going hard is the only thing that gives me a reprieve, albeit brief, from the symptoms. I have a watch that monitors heart rate and have been making sure I am not overdoing it in the gym though, as I don't want to over stress an already stressed body. I am lucky in the sense that mentally, I am good, maybe a bit grouchy at times. I don't have any real thoughts of self harm, or anything like that, quite the opposite ; I have a job I like, a wife I love, and a life that is really pretty good....I just want to be able to enjoy it in it's entirety once again!

The biggest challenge I have right now is reminding myself that ""this too shall pass"", and that my symptoms while crappy, could be a lot worse, had I been on the drug more frequently and for a longer time. As well, as much as I love my wife, she just doesn't get how I feel, or how an addictive mind works. She is very much of the mindset of ""mind over matter"", and while I agree to a certain extent, some of what I am feeling is certainly physiological as well as mental. As I said, mental acuity is in tact, I can and enjoy vigorous exercise, and am still generally productive. Meditation has been a help also, as well as prayer. I feel like garbage most of the time, but I still feel excited for what it'll be like coming out the other side of this!!

Thank you so much for readying my lengthly post. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated, personal stories etc. I totally see how a support network of some kind is helpful when going through this, so I am pledging to come back here and encourage others struggling, when I am fully recovered.

&#x200B;

Thanks for the support, I really do appreciate hearing what ppl have to say!! 

Have a great day!!

It all started when I was 15 (I'm 19 now) when I moved in with my aunt after my mom got deep into her heroin addiction. I was doing online school in my aunt's office at her house. I needed a pen to take notes so I look in a drawer in her desk. I stumbled across her bottle of 1mg Xanax. I thought ""hey I hear rappers talk about Xanax all the time fuck it I'll try it."" I was already a daily weed smoker at the time but that's all i did at the time. I took 2 footballs after I finished my class work for the day and rolled up a blunt and went outside to smoke it. Half way through my blunt i felt AMAZING. I instantly fell in love. I would take them from my aunt once in a while and take them at night and play videogames. I eventually started buying bars from a good friend of mines older brother. My aunt never noticed her pills missing. She found out when I blacked out over my friends house at 16 (he called her saying he was scared i was gonna die) she came and got me and she was screaming at me the entire car ride home. I remember when we got back home I had 4 bars in my pocket and like an idoit I took them all ended up arguing with my aunt and she threatens to call the police on me. I end up grabbing a kitchen knife and holding it to my throat saying i wanna die and all sorts of crazy shit. I end up getting put in the looney bin for 10 days and i return home. I did good for a while slipping up here but was doing well in life considering my past. Well my best friend and I swap cars for the day (he went to a concert and my car is better on gas) I go to my liquor store up the road from me and grab some blunt wraps and this guy who lives down my block asks for a ride home. When I drop him off he offers me a few norcos, i took them from him even though opiates aren't really my thing. And says he has Xanax bars for $1 each. Which is crazy because I'm in the Detroit area and 70% of bars are pressed and bars go for $5-8 a pop. I've even heard people selling them for $10. Anyways he opens his bottle and I buy 15 of them and hit up my friend and i end up driving over his house. (Here's where shit gets fucking nuts) i get there give him 3 bars and I took 5 all at once. You can already guess what happens next. I BLACK THE FUCK OUT. Apparently I ended up drinking 99 proof liquor 45 minutes after popping those xans and ended up taking all the norcos I had. My friend C told me that i blew up one of my MDMA plugs and drove there to get a half gram. I gave him .2 and i took .3 , on the way back to his house (which is 40 minutes from my connects house) I get pulled over while smoking a blunt and a cup full of booze. I guess I told the cop some bizarre story and HE LET ME GO. car obviously reaked of weed and i smelt like alcohol. My friend C told me I was literally swerving all over and people were honking the horn and yelling at me. I than proceeded to hit a telephone pole (keep in mind I have my friend M's car) and i peeled off. I ended up pulling into a random driveway he told me and some lady in a robe came out WITH A FUCKING PISTOL and was aiming it at the car screaming at us to leave. What do I do? My blacked out ass gets out of the car and walks up to her. I have no idea who this lady was or what was said when I approached her. My friend says she goes back inside and i go back into the car just scrolling on my phone still in her driveway for another 10 minutes before I left. I than hit ANOTHER telephone pole. At this point I totaled my boys car, and I just get out of the car and leave my boy C in the passenger seat. C suffers from bad panic disorder and hardly ever EVERRR leaves his house. It's around 4-5 AM and were two white kids in deep Detroit with a totaled car. The police role up on him and ask where the driver was. They some how found me (I have no idea what I was doing or where I was) they took us to the precinct and C's dad picked us up. YES, ALL THIS HAPPENED WITH NO CHARGES. we get back to his house and it's like 9AM at this point and I decide to go for a walk, shirtless. C told me I went outside shirtless next thing he knew there's police banging on his door, he didn't answer. And I'm getting taken away in an ambulance. What I did when I left his house shirtless at 9am is beyond me. This was in June 2019. I woke up in another physch ward stayed for 14 days and was discharged. My aunt ended up buying my friend M a new car because i literally totaled his. (To this day M will not talk to me) Fast forward and me and my girlfriend move into her mom's house in Indiana. It was a fresh start away from everything. She was gonna let us stay there for 3-4 months to get us on our feet. I found a job within a week, was doing well for myself. I brought an ounce of bud with me down there because I know literally no one with weed. Anyways her mom's neighbor smokes and didn't have any (and good weed is RARE there) I came over her neighbors house after work and rolled a few blunts and smoke them down. That's when G (her neighbor) calls me away from his wife while her and my gf stay on the porch smoking. He asks me if wanna trade any weed for bars? He pulls out a bottle of bars and offers me 8 of them for an 8th. I knew I shouldn't have done it but I said fuck it. I'll only take 1 MAX at a time and only take them at bed time. Well I took 1 that night, and that led to me taking all of them. Got blacked out again and her mom kicked me out. (My car broke down in Indiana) so she calls my aunt and takes a 4 hour drive to come and get me. I've been back here, picked up a shit ass job at O'Reilys and I'm away from my girlfriend who I was with daily for almost a year. It fucking kills me, I've lost everything due to benzos. My car, my best friend, my girlfriend. Me and my girl are still together but she's 3 hours away  north of me. (She moved back in with her dad who's in Michigan) but still I'm 3 hours away. It was never a problem because I had a car. Now I have no vehicle, haven't saw her in close to a month and I'm sleeping on my aunt's couch with literally nothing. (She gave my room up). And the sad thing. I took a Valium the other day to come down from an addy binge. I was fine, just i can't believe after all this i still took another benzo. And to be honest if there was a Xanax bar in front of me I'd take it. It's pathetic i know.",13

I would think it has to do with how fast someone metabolizes it, as I know half lives can vary within a range from person to person. I say this because I cut my Klonopin dose by 1/8th last Monday night. People said that it would take a couple days for me to really feel the WD symptoms, and my symptoms would peak about a week later. However, I felt it that night, was in full blown withdrawal the by next evening, and my symptoms had mostly subsided within 72 hours.

I'm currently tapering down from 2mgs Xanax/daily. Due to interdose withdrawal, my doctor has given me the choice to switch to a longer acting benzo. The options are either Klonopin drops or diazepam. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure which one to pick. On the one hand, i've read horror stories about klonopin being the absolute worst benzo for PAWS. On the other hand, the half-life of diazepam is so extremely long that a significant amount of the drug is 'build up' in the system, making me think that it would be counterproductive to taper from.

I was prescribed 1 mg for years.  At first all was well and then i started running out of meds early and stealing pills from my dad etc.  Now I am 38 and have tried an unsuccessful taper to diazepam 1 year ago and started lying and stealing from my dad again.  I would break the pills up into tiny pieces to make it through the day.   I ran out and went into 3 weeks withdrawal 

Here’s where I am at:  I came clean to my psych and my family about the relapse and she put me on .5 mg of Klonopin to reinstate and level out with notion of doing a dry cut and hold taper.  I started on .25 in the am .25 in the pm.  We just dropped that to .25 in am and .125 in the pm.  I definitely felt the change after a few days but nothing earth shattering.   

Question:  Is this a feasible way to discontinue this medication considering the duration of usage? My doctor is being cool with me guiding the process and there is no set timelines.  The liquid titration seems like a pain in the ass,  I would rather just cut pills and get through it.  Pros Cons.

Dumb me...sigh:/

What I truly need is to find a psychiatrist who will help me analyze me(longgg sessions) and suggest to me why it is the way I am...why do I feel the need to escape? (Visions of Sigmund Freud swirl thru my thoughts now):)

This is my first time posting publicly about my benzo history.
I am 19 years old and Autistic. At 16 I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders, depression and chronic insomnia. I have an addictive personality, as did my mom (who is a hero for cutting cigarettes cold turkey after smoking like 3 packs a day for 25+ years). Anyway. I was prescribed Xanax for my anxiety and, well, since I'm posting here it didn't go well. 
Due to some (un)lucky circumstances, I was basically able to get pharma Xanax whenever I wanted. 
I ended up using 4 mg/day for 2 years, some taking 6 or 7 for the lols, handing them out to friends I'd smoke bud with etc. 
At some point, I don't remember what happened, but I decided to quit. I never told my psychiatrist or family about my abuse of it (big mistake) and had no idea how to properly quit, so after taking 2.5 mgs for like a couple days, I went cold turkey (huge mistake). 
What followed up was weeks of literally hell, thankfully without seizures. It was probably the toughest time in my life, and I attempted suicide after the first week. My family never suspected the benzos, or maybe they just didn't tell me if they did. 

I've been clean for a year now, apart from the two times I took a different benzo for a legit reason, and I haven't touched since. My mental health has improved significantly since I moved to a different country, got into university and into a relationship with a wonderful person. The darkest days are long gone and I'm thankful. 

Now, some nights for no reason, but always after I chill with people who eat bars, or in drug subs, I get glimpses of all of it again. I get the sweats and the headaches and the twitches and my heart doing weird stuff. Sometimes I can't even sleep and I get the big paranoia. I also get cravings. This happens very rarely anymore, but it happened again today and it kind of ruined my weekend. I ride it out but it sucks, man.

Y'all ever get this? Is it normal? And will it........ever go away? Any tips or just...kind words? I'm so depressed today because of that.


If you read this far, thank you. 
Stay safe, friends!",11

i’m gonna say it, i am a year and a half sober from xanax and every single day is a struggle for me. some days are obviously better than others, but i still think about xanax all the time. my first instinct is to think about drugs when i’m sad, or even when i’m happy. i feel like i need it all the time. 

i don’t do pills or anything deemed “hard drugs” (although all of it is bad) but i drink, and smoke weed. do i want pills? fuck yes. i want xanax all the time. it doesn’t go away: i preach about addiction so i can help someone else, or perhaps fool myself into thinking i’m doing exponentially better than i used to. but i’m still in this sick mentality that i was happier addicted to xanax. even tho my life wasn’t better, i felt better. duh, lol your doc is gonna make u feel better. i fluctuate between feeling better and feeling worse. it’s stupid for me to participate in partying but that’s what makes me feel good. party life makes me feel less crazy. yeah it’s wrong but it’s how i feel. 

ppl say it’s normal but i meet so many addicts who swear up and down they wouldn’t touch their doc. i’d die if i did, bc i wouldn’t stop. that’s why i don’t. 

not bc i don’t want to. i’d do anything to be able to relieve myself of this constant anxiety and mental issues. i’m so sick of living a lie. i’m not ok. i’m rlly not ok. i have to get this shit off my chest.",2

Basically the situation I’m in is that I’ve been on about 2mg of lorazepam for the past 30 days, recreationally, not prescribed. 

With that said, I have about 20 more .5 mg lorazepams at my disposal and the possibility of coming up on 40ish more if need be. I also don’t have the option of switching to another longer acting bento, which I thought I should mention since I’ve seen that recommended to do when possible. 

I’m hoping somebody can help me out with some kind of tapering schedule given the amount I’ve been taking and what I have left. Mostly what I’m worried about is developing a seizure problem from the withdrawals. The anxiety and discomfort are secondary worries to that. 

I also have a regular prescription of topamax if anyone thinks that would be at all helpful.

2019-10-05 14:57:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ddrksa/tapering_but_constantly_failing/,Tapering but constantly failing,"Hi,

I've been depressed coming and going, had panic attacks and one or two psychosis in my lifetime (35+ atm). I've done most kind of drugs, mostly weed and alcohol the others are not a concern since i'm not interested in them at all in this stage of my life.

I try to taper my benzo use, had a script before but since the psychiatrist wouldn't continue discovery since i couldn't leave a supervised urine test due to phobia of someone even close to me while taking a piss I quit the therapy and moved on thinking i could manage. Meaning no more script. At the time i kind of felt ok. Then i started smoking weed again and buying benzo from darknet (Lorazepam, Clonazepam & Diazepam). Now i've been on benzos daily for more or less 8 months. In most cases not to get any high, just persevere.

Lorazepam = great if you use it daily, 2.5mg and all was good but then i tried to start tapering that and it was hell.  
So switched to a more long acting one, Clonazepam = It's good, i feel slight memory loss sometimes but doing about 1mg-1,5mg/day is not a large dose, imho.  
Diazepam, the longest acting one, can't put my finger on it but it does not seem to help very much at all imho.

I got about 35-ish 2mg clonazepam tabs at home and 8 Lorazepam 2.5mg, i really want to get off all kind of drugs but i constantly fall back into this dark hole and then i reach for them.

Now i've decided to 1) quit weed totally 2) try to stay on a tapering with clonazepam … but i fail time and time again. I can't go see a doctor about this because where i live they have a duty to report to social workers if they see any type of substance abuse with a patient that has a child which i do. I can't risk that they take my son away from me, he is the most precious thing in my life.

Feel like i'm spiralling down again after being of weed for so long time (was off for 1 year) and also did cut benzos for about a year too.

fffff… just don't know what to do or where to turn. Where i live it's illegal to even have drugs in your body. I will get reported right away if i end up in a hospital and they check me for this somehow.

Feel like buying 200x2mg clonazepam and 200x10mg diazepam and start tapering quite high, like 1.5mg clonazepam a day and then go from there a couple of weeks down to 1mg, then do the Ashton manual thing.

Needed to get this off my chest, it's been a brutal weekend so far due to other things.

It's a mess, i know that … but i do got a well paying job, a comfortable home for me and my kid, pay my bills on time and manage with little disturbance. It's just the thing that i want to do this without the help of any kind of drug.

PS: I try to never get intoxicated when my kid is around … i have him 50% of the time. I have about no one I can talk about this with without the risk of everything getting fucked up.  


PS2: Where i live it's possible to read doctor journals and i did a few days back. I've done a lot of tests with my then psychiatrist. I've scored positive for GAD, childhood ADHD, grown up ADHD/ADD and or Borderline  Disorder + possible Unstable Personality Disorder.   


  
Fuuuuck… feel like going to the bar and having 4 shots of vodka and then go home and take a bunch of benzo and smoke the weed that is actually in a trash bag now but sitting by my door ready to take out.",8

I've been smoking cbd which has helped me sleep throughout the taper. 

I haven't smoked thc weed in months, maybe 8 months even.


Yesterday I got cravings (I was also an alcoholic), Friday cravings, like I wanted to feel good. So I bought some normal thc weed. Knowing that this could make me anxious I used just the smallest amount. Think like 1 quarter of a pea sized amount of thc weed mixed with my cbd weed. I wanted to be really careful as weed has made me very anxious in the past.


It seemed to work, I got a tiny bit high, watched cartoons, and slept for much longer than I normally do.


But I woke up and even though my last dose drop was a week ago, I had all the withdrawal symptoms of tapering to fast. 


Even now, after having half of my daily dose, I still feel terrible. 


Does anyone have any experience in this? I read there could be interactions, but it's all so confusing, some say it potentiates benzos, others saying it attenuates them. 


I'm certainly sticking to the cbd for now, but I'm curious as to what happened, because last night I slept for 10 hours, I feel like I caught up on a huge amount of sleep. Which is great, but I'm not feeling great.

Had no idea what I was doing when I just stopped taking the meds and hell ensued. Only figured out what i was going through by finding this group. Over the course of the last 48 hours I had a wave of symptoms that has brought me to my knees and almost to the hospital. I have two jobs and could not report to either one yesterday. Very bad intrusive audio and visuals. Severe nausea and dizziness. So so weak, shaking, the top of my head felt like a vice squeezing it. Sinuses all plugged up. It’s been horrible and for the first time during this detox a little voice was saying “it would be so easy just to go back on them” but I have nothing in my house and I didn’t. I do have my medical marijuana card here in the States so a little indica weed helps me with sleep which thankfully for the most part i was able to sleep in clusters of about 2-3 hours before anxiety would awake me and I’d have to work through that with breathing and praying and whatever else I could muster. I believe this wave was brought on by some super emotional days I had prior or maybe it was just time i don’t know. I’m laying in bed now getting ready to try and face this day. I’m really a bit scared now that I can have such a severe onset of symptoms this far into detox and wonder what others this far along in detox have experienced. I also used melatonin for getting to sleep last night and that seemed to help. I really don’t want to go back on any kind of prescription anti depressants or the like but was really close to thinking I needed to be in the hospital until I could finally feel things subsiding in the middle of the night last night. Any thoughts on detox this far in and how many more severe waves may be in my future? My second job is fairly new and I had to take a no call no show yesterday because they want a doctors note and I have no doctor to write me a note about this...it was bad.

Seems I’ve been tapering on and off the last 2 years. I have good weeks, then hell weeks. Longest I’ve gone in 15 or so years was 2 years without a benzo. Went from addicted to totally clean, but then around late 2017 my anxiety went through the roof and my health went downhill. Thankfully I didn’t get addicted again, but it’s been hard going a full week without at least 1 or 2 2mg lorazepam or at least a 5mg Valium.

Here I am almost 2 weeks, and while proud of myself, my anxiety just wont let up. I go through classes and my day anxious, popping inderal for my tremors and migraines.. but still dealing with chronic pain and all these “phantom” pains. One min my hands tingle the next my chest tightens then suddenly my lower left rib will ache and an hour later I’ve got some weird pain on my right rotor cuff. 

I want so badly to stay off them, but they’re almost a necessary evil. Knowing that they’re the only thing that calms my bodies nervous system. Be it from the damage they’ve done, or from whatever else my bodies been through. 
No other hormone, supplement, or pill has helped. They’ve only bought time or helped me go a day or two more. Which in a sense is great.. but I’m growing tired of it. I’m not working, and I’m hoping this aviation school I’m in will bring a better future once I’m out.. but I won’t be able to have any benzos if I get into it. Which is kinda great since I want to stay off em, but scary af cus it will be a stressful job. 

In the end idk what I can do but keep trying and hoping.. but I’m getting so tired and doubtful of myself.",5

I treat myself to an eigth of bud every so often, give or take every few weeks, binge for a week, then go back to a break. 

Last night whilst already under the influence, I went looking through old med bottles to keep the new stash in and happened upon what I think was an old klonopin bottle. No actual pills in there, but a dusty film of residue hanging around. First instinct to identify what it was (label was ripped off) was to take a whiff...I immediately went aghh thats kpin, and had low-key flashbacks of my withdrawal exactly a year ago. I quickly threw it out and washed my hands of that bad karma....but I'm legitimately afraid a few of those lingering particles snuck their way into my nose and absorbed intra-nasally.

There were no pills in there, and couldn't even see the particulate (wasn't like there was anything crushed in there)....but I was terrified the rest of the night that I had accidentally dosed myself.

Every morning I wake up, I open the small vial of volumetric-dosed liquid Etizolam (diluted with propelene glycol @ 5mg/ml), and as I watch the liquid draw itself up through the syringe I realise how pathetic I am. I am weak. It's a crutch—a bandaid—but I *need* it just to get through the day. 


Etizolam doesn't even make me feel high anymore, it just removes my ability to *think* about how miserable my life is. My life really isn't *that* bad, but I suffer from multiple mental disorders—mainly sensory processing issues—but it just slows my brain down and makes life, work and people bearable.


I missed my dose this morning and (even though I took my bedtime dose), I felt this hollowness rip away inside of my essence. It literally felt like death (and I'm *nowhere* near the withdrawal stage). I wanted to break down and cry. I came home, swallowed 5mg of liquid and within ten minutes I wondered what the hell I was sad about... Damn GABA addiction.


What can I do? Taper and go back to my neurologically-shitty existence of anhedonia?


I have yet to find a drug (besides Clonazolam) that can replace it. I just want to be happy, but if the human experience is all just brain chemicals, then what's wrong with taking it every day? People do it with antidepressants (weak argument, I know, but you may get my point) and the like.



It just seems like life is a matter of trading one addiction for the next.

Last Monday night my 3 year old boy was in major distress after finding out it was nap time. My wife and I told him to go lay down and spend some alone time and he threw a huge fit. I went into his room and spent time with him and he just couldn’t calm down. I looked him in the face and said take deep breaths with me and I started belly breathing. Within 10-15 seconds he started, and continued with me for a minute or two. It was beautiful, as he calmed down he was breathing deeper and deeper with me. Tears fell down my face and I killed him to sleep. 

For the last two years I’ve gone to therapy every Wednesday for anxiety. It spikes at night really bad and I’ve needed a benzo to sleep. I work at 2-3am and that’s part of the issue, early bed times. 

After teaching my boy to calm his emotions I realize something; I have all the tools and knowledge I need to beat the shit out of this silly habit. I went to my wife and said no more meds, no more benzos, I can do this. 

I haven’t had one since. I’ve had some moments and days that were difficult but I want to tell you what’s been the most rewarding part, knowing I can. After committing to this and not going back I feel like I can beat anything now, any mental hurdle I can beat. We all can. The decision to say no is your most powerful tool. Go slow, get help, be open with people, tell your friends if you need accountability. The best me is here, and even though I don’t have a get out of jail free card anymore, I’m free because I’m not in jail, that’s the sweetest part.

Im looking for some reassurance, opinions or help here. I dont have any diagnosed mental disorders, and no real history of issues. Though I do feel i have some sort of Anxiety disorder which affects me daily for the most part and have suffered from a handful of panic attacks over the years. I've not had an issue with abusing drugs, in an irresponsible manner that is, as ive used several assortments of drugs over the years and have very rarely binged or got to deep. Aside from smoking weed which has range from consistent daily and couple times a month. But that said, no other drugs were ever more than a once in a while thing. But xanax is a whole other world once you go a couple days at lower dosage instead of trying to get zooted and experience no anxiety ever. Almost pure happiness, till it turns to the need of course.

Its crazy because this whole experience feels like it flew by from the first addy I popped, and half bar I swallowed 6 hrs later to freaking out, feeling disorganized, depressed, numb, confused and fiendish for an hour VS feeling at the top of the world thinking I can and will do anything I want and need, happy, relaxed, accomplished, and good with myself right after. I recognize my mistake now and realize I need to get my mentality straight first to begin this process, but this would help greatly in confidence. My work is being affected, I oversleep for work constantly, even getting 8+ hrs almost daily. My mind is on a wire I can feel balancing between losing it and staying sane, or at least it feels that way.

4months ago:

I started taking xanax a couple times a week with adderall, slightly for recreation and also for work.  At first it was at most 1mg but usually .5 to come down from the addy, and .5 with the addy to keep me cool. ANd 15mg adderall, only a few times 30mg ir or XR and i didnt like it. I got a little hooked with adderall because of a ridiculous work schedule, and since I needed sleep I started taking xanax pretty much daily, and it turned to 1mg-2mg.I also have been smoking pretty much nightly, since before this started and cut back slightly with the adderall, but still was smoking. I stopped the stims almost daily usage for a solid 3 weeks. No issues really just sleepy more. This was over the course of around 2.5 months. 

Since then ive noticed I can actually enjoy getting STONED more now. I used to be a whole ass stoner but was done for a good 2 years ish and then just did it once in a while, at night. For a while certain strains or getting to high was anxiety inducing, so I would smoke but lightly or only great indica. But with bars, no anxiety plus super faded was amazing. Im still take addys sometimes but not often more for recreation. This 2 weeks ive noticed im going thru 2-4mg easily almost daily, i thought it was just gonna be a couple dope ass highs but now im realizing the physical symptoms if I dont take it around the same time (sporadically but typically late afternoon.)Ive gone 2 nights only 2mg and no issues really other than craving, and I plan on working towards that. 

My concern is:

Is this dosage considered extreme at all and is the time frame of heavy usage (2mg+ daily for roughly a month, 4mg semi consistently last 2 weeks)

Can I taper quickly over 2-4 weeks, without a significant amount of physical symptoms? 

Am i at a risk of the harder side of withdrawals if I try to taper too quickly? 

Would it be best to see my PCP and see if they would be willing to help with a withdrawal plan that is well suited for me, even though im coming as an unprescribed user? 

Sorry for the long read but I appreciate any one who may answer. Thank you all and I wish everyone the best.",3
