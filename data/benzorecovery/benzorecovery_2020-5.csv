He's prescribed me with 1MG and I can take it up to 3 times a day however, at most I've only taken it twice a day and most days it's just once. 

Today I decided that my vision issues and constant dizziness might be the result of the Lorazepam and I've decided that I'm not going to take it anymore. 

I've read horror stories about this medicine and I'm worried that I might start having withdrawal symptoms. I've been taking it daily for almost a month now and am stopping it immediately regardless of my anxiety I'm experiencing.

Then the day of the wedding I got a termination letter, it turns out his nurse was following me on Facebook vent my frustration. They kicked me out the hospital and off klonopin and was on 80mg methadone at time all cold Turkey. I was even in their psychward coming off this stuff and would not taper me. I stayed clean for 8 months of PURE HELL!!! I only could of done that because I got unemployment from old radio job and could stay at my parents just recovering. After so long my parents didn't understand I was still detoxing after 8 months and started bitchn at me to get a job. So in order to actually sleep and not literally shake in anxiety at work I relapsed started buying benzo of the street and that took off for last year now.

A while back I went back to the psychward to tell them I need my damn medication back and they did nothing just left me in a dark room for a day till I was like fuck it I'll go back to streets because these people do not care.  I'm sooo tired of working my ass off just to buy a medication that I cant stop taking. I just take it 3 to 4 mg a day and all the money I make goes to these pills so I have nothing.

Im supposed to take 4mg of Klonopin ( not gonna lie, i had taken 6mg of Klonopin at night because i wanted to make sure i wasn't total zombie) which i wasnt. Had no high at all. Ive tried kpins recreational and nothing happened.
I appreciate their concern but they cut my meds in half. So im only getting about 2mg. Sometimes 1.5mg
When i was on xanax i was taking 6mg. So going down to 4mg Klonopin in it self suck. Not even a week they took my meds back. 
Went straight from 4mg to 2mg and im pretty upset. I dont plan on abusing it because it doesnt make me weird.  I just  feel functional. Ive been threatened to be kicked out again.  I plan moving next week. Then i can actually control my meds.
The Klonopin has been a great sub for xanax (was on for 1.5yrs daily but i developed an addiction, ) Kpins just make me feel normal. Talkative, less moody, appetite. Now ive lost about 9lbs from my parents ""tapering"" me.

She collapsed and had a seizure in front of me and is still in the hospital recovering. She has been both on and addicted to benzos for the past six years and has resorted to buying them off of the street for the past year or so. We live in a neighborhood that is filled with drug dealers and addicts, but are going to be moving out of state to live with my grandparents by August. She has been paying for these drugs by stealing from her family (thousands upon thousands of dollars). As of 3 days ago, she decided to quit cold turkey because of this, realizing everything she has done not only to our family but to herself. I think going off of them so suddenly is what caused the seizure and a host of other issues. Now we‚Äôre trying to decide what to do next. She doesn‚Äôt have health insurance and she isn‚Äôt too keen on going to rehab, but I think this would be her best option. I also think group therapy would be good for her, so she can talk to people who are in the same position as her. I‚Äôm mostly posting here to look for some advice. Is rehab her only option or is there anything else I should be looking into to get her help? She mostly doesn‚Äôt want to go to rehab because she doesn‚Äôt want to leave me here alone in this shitty neighborhood, but I told her not to worry about that, that I can take care of myself (she‚Äôs a highly anxious and overprotective person). I‚Äôm scared of her coming home and either having another seizure or relapsing, so if she won‚Äôt go to rehab I really just am wondering if there‚Äôs something else I can do.",2

I took one rescue dose of .25 Xanax and 2 weeks of zyprexa in the psych ward a few months ago and i was put on remeron 1mg in the psych ward in month 8, which I am tapering now.

 I'm suffering horrifically with mental symptoms for nearly 18 months straight now 24/7.¬† I am not experiencing just intrusive thoughts or anxiety here and there but full on mental and sometimes physical akathisia.¬†  


My thoughts race faster than i can count from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep.¬† Looping and sticking on everything I hear, watch, read, think.¬†Even normal thoughts send terror through my brain and body.  


I have extreme terror like I am falling out of a plane 24/7.¬† Hyper-awareness of all my thoughts which race with useless information 24/7 jumping from topic to topic with no rhyme or reason.  


Horrible memory problems where i can forget something and loop for hours. Thoughts feel delayed and will sometimes pop up a few second or hours later.  


Severe OCD type symptoms where my brain will find anything to latch onto and have a compulsive urge to find out what my brain doesn't understand.¬†I can't watch any TV or talk to anymore because my brain obsessively questions everything and wants to know what it is.  Like a word, someones name, a sign, text on a shirt.    


Intrusive thoughts and memories, ruminating, earworms, looping/sticking, terror, rage, akathisia and many more.  


I am tapering remeron and trying to quit cigarettes.  


I have been so severe for so long I am loosing hope and the fight.  


I practice letting the thoughts be there but its non stop mental anguish that it's impossible.¬†  


There is a constant feeling of wanting to run away from my thoughts but my thoughts wont stop racing.  


I feel i am constantly stuck monitoring my thoughts that come into my head.  


If i could distract with something I would be able to fight this but distraction doesn't work and I've tried everything.  


I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 

I have never come across anyone else as severe as me for this long.

 I started having a brief fog in the morning about the time I stareted messing with my prozac. Since then its gotten worse, a brief morning fog turned into flow brown  anxiety and mental brake down panic attacks where i fell like I'm buried alive, stared on the 23nd. My brain is consistently cold and feels like is shriveled up. Is this a big no no. Going down on my prozac before a taper and cold turkeying tabacco three days after a clonazapam taper. This is the third day I've been back on my original prozac dose. And I had to walk back my taper.

 I have to note I'm very sensitive to medications, having my dose increased to 10 mg to 40 mg of what ever antidepressants I was on sent me in to a 3 weeks of hell. First three days were non stop tremmiring and panic attacks this happened in 2016. Even just switching manufacturers can sent me into episodes like that, when I moved to Arizona in nov of 2016 and I couldn't get the same manufacturer of what I was taking in North Dakota and that what led me to go on the prozac.",2

(Switched to Valium because I was scared of withdrawals) dosage was highest in the begging at about 10mg but that wasn‚Äôt for long. 

I rapidly reduced to 7.5mg and then 5mg as I wasn‚Äôt feeling much withdrawal symptoms. I then switched to 3.75mg and took that dose for a week. The dose I was on the longest was 5mg for at least 1 or 2 months.

I am now on my 3rd day of 2.5mg and the withdrawals are quite uncomfortable and my daily dose doesn‚Äôt seem to affect me at all except for slightly reducing my anxiety and heart rate.

I‚Äôm planning to take this dose for a week total and then reduce to 1.25mg for another week and then possibly quitting for good.

I also recently quit smoking weed after heavy use for months and my most uncomfortable symptom is complete loss of appetite. 

I almost never drink alcohol or take any sort of drugs that affect the GABA receptors.
What do you guys think? Will my symptoms get worse from now? Should I go slower? I doubt I‚Äôll experience any seizures but it‚Äôs still something that concerns me.",2

I‚Äôm currently taking .25mg of Lorazepam/Ativan once daily and am trying to slowly taper off. I started at 2.5mg per day back in January and have gradually worked my way down to .25mg, but I‚Äôve been stuck here for over a month now. From what I understand, Ativan is a terrible drug to taper with because of its short half-life, and switching to something like Valium would be preferable.

Sadly, I definitely do not trust my ARNP to accurately convert my dosage. He‚Äôs kind of a space cadet and knowing him, he would likely just prescribe me the same exact dose without considering the difference between the meds.

The good news is he‚Äôll essentially just give me whatever I ask for, so I‚Äôm looking for some informed feedback. I know I should really switch doctors... but to make matters worse, I lost my job/insurance due to Covid and he only makes me see him every 3 months which saves me a ton of money.

Considering that my #1 goal is to taper, what dose should I be converting to and what tablet strength should I ask for to make tapering by weight as accurate as humanly possible? I‚Äôm using a precise digital milligram scale.

2020-05-26 09:29:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/gqx2t6/to_reinstate_or_not/,To reinstate or not?,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

Quick history: Three years of daily (prescribed) Valium use, at minimum 5mg at most 20mg (dose varied over that time). On and off recreational Xanax use, have not touched Xanax or any Alprazolam in 6 months.   


Since February, I was on a liquid taper, with liquid diazepam prescribed by a Psych, getting down to 4mg daily. Around March, I (stupidly) began increasing my dose here and there, having some days where I would take 10 or even 15mg instead of my prescribed 4. As I ran out, my last dose of ANY benzo was on April 8th, making it 7 weeks after cold turkey'ing from an average of maybe 10mg a day. Obviously the withdrawal symptoms since then have been HORRIFIC: severe anxiety with agoraphobia, panic attacks, DP/DR, intrusive thoughts/paranoia, depression and suicidal ideation, muscle pain and joint pain, complete inability to focus. I'm seeing my Psychiatrist next week (we meet every 3 months), and he would be able to prescribe me the liquid Diazepam needed to continue the taper I was meant to follow.  


My question is: should I reinstate at 4mg, and try a taper again? Or just deal with the withdrawal symptoms from cold turkey'ing? I suppose the main issue is, if I reinstate, my quality of life will significantly improve, but I also run the risk of a more severe withdrawal later on, or potentially needing a higher dose. As difficult as every day is, I also don't want to undo the last 7 weeks. Can reinstating, or even taking the occasional emergency benzo really bring withdrawal back to day one?  


Any advice, particularly from anyone who has experienced periods of abstinence from CT'ing, followed by reinstating, would be greatly appreciated :)  


Thanks so much.",9

But I'm still able to not think about it or miss it when I'm not with an enabling friend. We all said tonight that we're starting to push our luck.

Does anyone have any advice? I feel I'm in the early stage of addiction to Coke and valium and want to see if I can stop on my own before it gets worse.

Clonazepam is the only thing we haven‚Äôt messed around with, so by process of elimination, I‚Äôm 99% sure my depersonalization is back because of my lengthy benzodiazepine habit. The clonazepam just doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I can take 3 or 4 and receive very very little to no relief from my anxiety and dissociation. I just get sleepy and depressed. 

Friday I started taking 0.5mg as per my doctor‚Äôs suggestion and this coming Friday I‚Äôll be moving down to 0.25. He says if I have trouble with that we can move to something like Valium to titrate in smaller increments. 

This already very hard. I can‚Äôt sleep. I mean I‚Äôm sleeping but I don‚Äôt feel like I am. I try and nap during the day but I can‚Äôt. 

What can I do to help during this time while I‚Äôm coming off this? What supplements would be helpful? Should I cut out alcohol altogether? I‚Äôm very afraid and any help would be very much appreciated.",2

No symptoms after 5 days.,"I tapered from 40 mg of Valium over the course of 21 months. I had been on 40 mg for about 4 years, with an additional 6 years before that using benzos intermittently.

Things started to get bad around the 12 mg mark. From that point on I dropped 1 mg every three or four weeks with some plateau periods mixed in. It took me 8 months to go from 40 mg to 12 mg. It took me 13 months to go from 12 mg to 0.

The worst part of my taper was 12 mg to 3 mg. Once I got to 3 the rest was pretty smooth sailing (though I also quit alcohol around that time which undoubtedly helped).

It took me  5 months to go from 3 mg to 0. Looking back I could have easily done it in 1 month. It was my fear of the jump that held me back.

I also reasoned that because I was on Valium for so many years, my jump would be more difficult than other people's. I really don't think this line of reasoning is true. If you taper properly, the last few mg should be equally easy no matter how long you've been using or at what dose you've been using. But the key words here are ""taper properly"".

Don't fear the jump. I was truly shocked at how easy my jump was. I didn't believe Ashton when she wrote that the final jump shouldn't be any harder than the previous cuts, but she was *absolutely right*.

Things that helped my taper:

1. Quitting alcohol. This was by far the most beneficial thing I did for my taper. So much of the constant anxiety and tension disappeared when I stopped drinking. From that point on my taper was relatively painless.
2. Trazodone. Excellent medication for sleep. The first time I tried quitting Valium I wasn't using anything for sleep which meant I was getting maybe 2 hours of sleep per night. Needless to say, that taper didn't end well. You need to be able to get at least *some* sleep, and for me, trazodone was the best option.
3. Gabapentin. It has a dulling effect, but it removed quite a bit of the more agitated benzo symptoms. 

Edit: What I meant in the title was, ""it's been 5 days and I still have no symptoms"". There's a chance things could get worse in a few days, but I know my body well enough to safely say the worst is behind me.",15

I tapered down for the past two months during quarantine and then completely stopped two weeks ago. I feel mostly ok now with some anxiety here and there, but all around withdrawals were tolerable.

Now what I‚Äôm wondering - when can I start taking Xanax for specific anxiety inducing situations again? I originally started taking Xanax because I started getting panic attacks during public speaking situations and big meetings at work, but it eventually evolved into me taking it everyday. 

The thing is - tomorrow is my grandma‚Äôs funeral and I have a small speaking part. I definitely think I need to take some Xanax for it. Would it be bad or set me back if I took just .5 mg for it? 

I actually think in some ways if I take it tomorrow, do the speaking part, and then I go back to not taking it, I could build some confidence that I‚Äôm fine taking it for specific situations again.

Would tapering schedule is recommended or cold turkey for this use time? Some people seem to play the long game on the taper and some play the short game. Since I haven't been using long would it be logical to go short here? Like next week go to 1.5mg then next week 1mg then half mg next week then done?

Feel rough and low on sleep and irritated but will probably get through this. I Intend to drink myself to sleep tonight. Cold turkey looks like it was the right call so far, thanks guys!

Edit #2 so made it to day 6. No relapse, and also very little sleep. The lack of sleep is starting to get to me. If I do relapse I feel as it will be the lack of sleep that gets me to do it. I don't always make the best decisions when I'm tired. But, so far so good.

Edit #3 so last night, night 7 is what I would call my first good night of sleep since quitting. It still wasn't great sleep but was good and the first time I was able to get more than a hour and half of deep sleep in a night since stopping which really helped.

Edit #4 hopefully final edit. So I think I'm back to normal, after day 9 I started sleeping normally, good amount of deep sleep and woke feeling good. And after a few days of good sleep I think it's behind me.

Respect benzos people, the fact that a short term of use and dosage could effect me for a week was crazy, I've done/abused  harder drugs with less of a withdrawal than these things.",2

2020-05-19 08:27:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/gmnkxh/crossroads_and_need_some_advice/,Crossroads and need some advice,"Hey everyone - I need some advice from the community here. My anxiety has been severe for about 4 months now. My psychiatrist prescribed me Klonopin. This stuff really hits me hard, so I started taking .125mg in the morning, and .25mg at night **as needed** for insomnia, so my daily dosage has ranged from .125mg-.375mg for 3 months. 

I've also been working my way up in dose on Lexapro over the last 6 weeks (side effects, ugh.) and just hit 10 mgs for the last week. My plan was to keep my Klonopin dose as low as possible, get stable on the Lexapro, taper off the Klonopin, and either keep it around for emergencies or just get rid of it depending on how bad the taper was.

I initially went 3 days without sleep because of anxiety which is what led to my benzo prescription in the first place. Not sleeping is a huge anxiety trigger for me, and both my GP and psychiatrist said low dose Klonopin is better than not sleeping for days and needing to be knocked out with high-dose Ativan.  

It seems like most nights i can sleep great and it's glorious. I went 14 days just taking .125mg and sleeping like an angel. Then last night tossing and turning, not being able to sleep at all, and took the extra .25mg. It's a double-edged sword for me because I'm scared to \*not\* take the drug and just be up for days, but I'm afraid \*of\* the drug.

I'm not really sure whether to:   
a) Just accept my current benzo usage until the SSRI is working well, choose some upper limit (.5mg daily?), and taper as soon as the SSRI hits it's stride.   
b) Try to come off the daily .125mg and just use ""as needed"" (although I'm afraid my overall dose might \*go up\* here)  
c) Just try to quit while I'm still at such a low dose and try to avoid any sort of protracted withdrawal hell. 

I've tried the antihistamine drugs (zzzquil, hydroxyzine) without any luck as a sleep aid.  I know some people have had luck with Trazadone, Seroquel, or Remeron for sleep. I'm still figuring out the SSRI dosage though so I'm a bit worried about changing around too many medications at once.

Just wondering what you would recommend short and long-term.  


Thanks!",2

I've finally made the decision to stop after realizing how bad the withdrawals are going to be when I inevitably run out and can't get any more.

Does tapering come with any significant withdrawals? I plan to reduce by about 10mg per week until I make it down to 1 pill whenever it's actually needed.

I've dealt with anxiety for the past 8 years of my life so it was very easy to fall into benzo addiction. I'm currently taking citalopram which I am hoping will solve that problem by the time I am off the valium.

I'm very thankful I chose valium over something like xanax since the longer half life should make detox much more smoother. 

I'm currently on 7 pills and feel pretty normal, but it has been very common for me to just pop them by the handful out of boredom - I end up unable to walk or type normally yet feel completely sober. Some days it would be upwards of 20, so I'm thankful that I feel like myself right now.

Any stories about personal experiences would be really appreciated. I'm really scared of rebound anxiety sending me straight back into addiction.

I'm practicing meditation and a little bit of yoga to try and replace the need to pop pills, and I find the meditation really helps. If there's anything else I should be doing, please let me know.

EDIT: For what it's worth, I've only been addicted for about 2 months. It started off with 1 or 2 here and there to take the edge off or for partying, but then I hit a really stressful period in my life and purchased over 1000 to try and help me get through it, and with that many in front of me I started swallowing them like candy.",2

I didn't question it at all cause I mean we live in an apartment complex and there's always traffic. So I went on with my day. That night at like 4am Casey calls me and is freaking out. She's like ""Tell Dan nobody is outside and you aren't trying to pick our lock. "" I was like what?? Then Dan grabs the phone and is accusing me of trying to pick his lock and i'm just like hes gotta be bullshitting. The he said he saw this guy he had beef with at his daughter's bedroom window. He said he was screaming but no voice was coming out. Then Dan is like ""I have a gun bro, i'm not scared"" type shit and you gotta realize this guy is a thug. He said he heard my voice outside his front door and the lock was turning and then Casey started texting me freaking out and I instantly thought he had done a drug or smoked laced weed. So he is literally up all night at the window thinking me and this guy that he used to beef with like a year ago were trying to get in his house.

My schedule is something like this:  

Aug/18 - Started using .5mg of Xanax  

Sep/18 - 1.5mg of Xanax (2.5mg in extreme cases)  

Oct/18 - 1.25mg of Xanax  

Nov/18 - 1mg of Xanax  

Dec/18 - 0.75mg of Xanax + 5mg of Valium  

Apr/19 - .5mg of Xanax + 5mg of Valium  

Jul/19 - .25mg of Xanax + 5mg of Valium  

Dec/19 - .25mg of Xanax + 2.5mg of Valium

I deeply apologize if any of this bothers you with mention of the subs.

Hi everyone, I will spare you the whole history of my life.

I have been tapering off Suboxone for nine months. I have gotten down to .25 and I‚Äôm obviously very uncomfortable.

At the same time I was taking ~2.5-3mg of Clonopin 

My doctor gave me Librium (25mg x3) and I am on day one of truly having no klonopin. The doctor also gave me phenobarbital.

Do you guys think I should go through the entire detox at once and just jump at .25? My running idea was that I was going to use the Librium to come off the benzo‚Äôs. And then afterwardI would use the pheno for a few days to come
Off the Librium. 

The other option is cutting it down to .18, but I don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity to have therapeutic support with medication. I am essentially doing it at home detox. I don‚Äôt have the resources to go to inpatient. But I‚Äôve been given quite the toolbox. I don‚Äôt want to ruin it like I always do. 

Tl;dr: What is your opinion of Librium and pheno as it relates to acute sub and benzo withdrawal? If I jump at .25 will I be making a big mistake?

Thank you guys for all of your support and wisdom.",1

Previous to that I was in a regimen of 0.125mg of Xanax + 2.5mg of Valium for 4 months.

Now, as for my symptoms, I feel that my gut is not ok and pretty unstable, but that might be due to a gastritis I was diagnosed with: I drank a LOT of coffee. But hey, it was diagnosed while I was tapering so who knows if there is a relation. h. pylori is there too lol.

My worst symptom is certainly being hypersentitive to stress and anxiety: working for a few hours makes my brain feels like overheating and puts me on a state of anxiety that doesnt alter BP nor my heart rate but that is very uncomfortable. This and I am much more anxious and reacting bad for every serious work meeting, even without having any problem with this some months ago.

I don't know if it will get more stable than this while keeping this dosage, and I have here some CBD oil that I am keeping to use after the tapering. Another doubt comes then: is it a good idea starting the use in my first day of wd?

History:
For about 5 months I have been taking my normal regiment of 10mg diazepam in the AM and 10mg in the PM as part of my personal taper regiment. Rewind two months from today I noticed my nightly dose was becoming less necessary for sleep so I figured I would just stop taking it. I was on vacation and was probably smoking more cannabis than normal so sleep was less problematic. Needless to say it was a bad idea and I am now in a tough position.

Currently heavily depressed and the anxiety rebound has caused a problem with my work/personal life. Physical symptoms are not terrible surprisingly but digestion issues and muscle tension are present. I‚Äôve more or less been at home for the last 2 months (virus aside) and would like to transition back to normality.

So basically I‚Äôve abused alcohol/benzos from the age of 17-25. I got sober at a rehab back in October. Once I got out, I threw myself into AA (got a sponsor, was working the steps, the whole 9). 

A few weeks ago, during this pandemic I ended up ordering etizolam off of the darkweb. I don‚Äôt fucking know why, I think I was honestly just bored with the whole quarantine thing. I was also super stressed from work. Neither of these are excuses. I fucking let my disease get the best of me. 

I figured I could control my use (i.e only use one day a week). Which I did, for like 1 week. But inevitably, now I‚Äôm back to daily benzo use and I‚Äôm fucking terrified. I‚Äôve still been going to AA meetings (granted, they are on zoom), but haven‚Äôt told my sponsor, mom, girlfriend, anyone that I relapsed. I‚Äôm fucking scared that if I tell my mom she‚Äôll wanna send me back to rehab, or if I tell my girl she‚Äôll leave me. I can‚Äôt go back to rehab man I‚Äôll lose my job. And I‚Äôd be lost without my girl, we live together and if she left me I‚Äôd fucking spiral way outta control. 

Also something to note is that I haven‚Äôt drank, I only relapsed on benzos (hence why I‚Äôm posting here). 

I feel like such a piece of shit man. I was doing so well for 7 months. It‚Äôs only been 3 weeks of daily use, and really not at a high dosage, 1mg etiz/day or so. So I‚Äôm hoping I can taper down myself rather quickly. And obviously work up the courage to tell my gf, mom and sponsor or else the guilt will eat me alive.

Sorry for the rambling/rant. This is the first time I‚Äôve told people about my relapse. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

Cheers guys and stay safe.",13

It was given to me at 3mg/day alongside Wellbutrin (bupropion) for the treatment of depersonalization. This actually worked and for a long time I was mainly treated with only the clonazepam and various SSRIs from about 2010-present. During that time I have tapered myself to 1-2mg/day. For the longest time I would only take 1mg a day until very recently. I believe I have a very strong dependence. The clonazepam no longer benefits me and in the past year and half I have slowly been spiraling in depression and depersonalization. Taking more clonazepam does not help, it only makes me more numb and more depressed, whereas before it would completely alleviate my anxiety and feelings of dissociation. I need to get off of it as it is now causing me significant problems. I have been missing work and my personal life is becoming very damaged. 
 
‚ÄúThe signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine dependence include feeling unable to cope without the drug, unsuccessful attempts to cut down or stop benzodiazepine use, tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines, and withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Some withdrawal symptoms that may appear include anxiety, depressed mood, depersonalisation, derealisation, sleep disturbance, hypersensitivity to touch and pain, tremor, shakiness, muscular aches, pains, twitches, and headache.‚Äù

Aside from the hypersensitivity to touch or pain, tremor, etc - this describes how I have been feeling. I have also developed a very painful tic in my neck. I should have gotten off of this long, long ago. 

I see my psychiatrist in a week. Are there any medications I should suggest that can help with benzodiazepine withdrawal? I just want this to be over so badly. It is ruining my life.",1

I‚Äôm 27, but when I was 18 years old I had to quit klonopin cold turkey (along with about 4 or 5 other medications) after being prescribed it for 6 years solid.","My hands are literally shaking as I type this, the absolute hell that I was living in was unreal, so to find a place where my experience is understood is like a breath of fresh air. 

I‚Äôve had an unusual childhood, and to make an extremely long story short, I was adopted as a way for my adopted family to gain an income. I dealt with childhood abuse prior to my adoption when I was 10, so once I started ‚Äòacting out‚Äô when puberty hit, my adopted mom decided to seize the opportunity to classify me as mentally unstable. I was in and out of therapy, I was baker acted near a dozen times at least. Shipped off to some group home for bad kids (which got shut down 3 months after to my release when I was 17 for abuse) and stuffed full of a cocktail of uppers and downers and set up on disability or something, because I had a $500 check coming monthly in the mail with my name on it, and I was told I couldn‚Äôt have a job because if I worked too much it would lessen the total of the monthly check. 

A lot of the medications got switched around frequently because the Doctors and my adopted mom hasn‚Äôt found a mixture that ‚Äòfixed‚Äô me. Ambien, geodon, adderall, lithium, seroquel, Ritalin, but one thing that stayed constant was my twice daily (sometimes 3) dose of kpin. Started on it at the age of 13 and never decreased the dose, only increased it when ‚Äòmy body got used to it‚Äô 

I got pulled out of school at 16. I don‚Äôt remember much other than falling asleep in class and literally not being able to wake up, but I could hear people talking around me. This was when seroquel was in the mix. 

I‚Äôm not sure when it started, but I refer back to it as ‚Äòmedically induced narcolepsy‚Äô. I‚Äôm looked on so many parts of the internet, and maybe I‚Äôm just not googling it correctly, but every single day my body would shut down. It felt like a forced nap, like you took too much Benadryl and it‚Äôs all kicking in at once. I‚Äôd fall asleep, but I could hear the people around me (almost sounded under water) but I couldn‚Äôt wake up at all. 

After an hour or two, it would feel like a spell was lifted and i would be good to go. I told my drs about it and they kind of just brushed me off, I thought I was just going to have to spend the rest of my life taking a forced nap every single day. I literally had to plan my entire life around this.   

When I turned 18 my benefits got cut. I was stripped of my health insurance, and cut off from the monthly check that my adopted mom had taken successfully the whole time. And that also meant that my role there was done, and not even 3 months after my 18th birthday I was kicked out.   

I didn‚Äôt care about the check, but my adopted mom did. She told me I could move back in if I petitioned my case in court and sign over my rights to her stating that my mental health hinders my ability to successfully function in society.   

The real issue came to light when I went to fill my prescriptions because I ran out of my monthly kpins along with whatever else I was on.  
I remember geodon was close to $300. That was only one script of 5. I didn‚Äôt have a job or even a place to live (was living with current bf and his mom at the time) so I left empty handed. I was a little worried but not too concerned. 

Not entirely too sure what happened next, a lot of my memories of that time aren‚Äôt accurate or are completely gone, but I remember I got baker acted, cause I had to ride an hour in the back of a cop car with a methed out chick who smelled like piss while I wore handcuffs the whole time. 

I remember going to sleep when I got through the process of getting admitted. I tried sleeping and I remember feeling like I had a million little spiders crawling on me. I remember being sooooo cold but sweating through the 3 thin ass sheet/blanket they have me, and I remember wrapping the wet sheets around myself as I went and asked for more. 

I remember my boyfriend at the time picking me up when I got discharged 3 days later and I‚Äôll never forget how ‚Äòcrisp‚Äô everything looked. Sounds seemed enhanced, colors popped, I felt like I was noticing things again. 

I remember crying when I realized it was 4pm and I hadn‚Äôt napped. I thought that I was stuck in a reality that I had to plan everything around having mini coma attacks each day. 

I went through full withdrawals when I was 18 after steadily taking klonopin since I was 13. I didn‚Äôt know I was addicted, I was just told I wouldn‚Äôt function without them. I thought that meant that I would become MORE of a depressed anxious mess, not that I would literally feel like I was dying. I can‚Äôt say that the years after that were remotely easy. I honestly don‚Äôt know what is a product of my horrible dependency on these medications at a young age, or if I‚Äôm a clear cut example of what happens when you break a kid.   

I am doing much better at 27 now. I‚Äôm still healing, and still trying to piece together my life cause a lot of it felt like I was living in a fog.   

Honestly not too sure of what the long term affects of withdrawals are from this, or even if my situation is ‚Äònormal‚Äô.

  The amnesia effect is  chemically (in vitro)  more potent with  lorazepam  normally  but I stay very lucid on  5mg 4mg of lorazepam!   Which is  equivalent for 50mg of DZP 
  In my country  Clonazepam  is very controlled  and my doctor  cant put me on it . 
 So is there any high Half life benzo  that may work better? , and how can u explain  the DZP effect?",1

My psychiatrist is pretty adamant that I do a  rapid taper. ""Just enough to keep you from having a seizure and letting you get to sleep at night"", he said when I explained that going from a 60mg daily tolerance over two years to 20mg in 12 days has been brutal. Not to mention that taking JUST enough to keep me from having a seizure is a long way from the dose I need to sleep, which is why I thought that was a strange way of putting it.

Anyway, I've slept one hour a night for the last 13 days, and it's starting to wear on me. I'm never stabilized as my tapering is so fast, so I'm in constant heavy withdrawal. What's driving me crazy is the constant tremors. I can't even write my own name or stand up still without my legs shaking. I'm taking 150ng of Clonidine at night to help me sleep and alleviate WD, but it's not knocking me out though.

I know I'm in for a long WD and PAWS, but this is hell. How long after acute WD did tremors subside for you?",15

So after being on clonazepam for 7; years and tapering down to .75mg per day, I switched to the equivalent of that on diazepam. I cannot emphasize enough how much this has helped me. I‚Äôve even made a taper off the diazepam since my switch and I feel like a new person. I do not feel the pure terror I felt when tapering down on clonazepam. 

I literally feel like a huge claw has been removed from my back-that being clonazepam. I was nervous to make the switch but my doctor was so awesome about researching the actual equivalencies between the 2 meds and that has made all the difference. She used the Ashton manual and a trusted online benzo equivalency calculator. (My previous experience was that this other dr said it‚Äôs a 1 to 1 equivalent which landed me in the er bc it sent me into severe withdrawal. And then he just put me back on clonazepam.)

Anyway the diazepam switch was so smooth. No scary withdrawals from the clonazepam. It‚Äôs been a few months now, so I‚Äôm definitely out of the woods with regard to that.

Clonidine helps too.

Hope this info helps!",21

I am not sure if I have gastritis due to the benzos, probably not because I drank a lot of coffee daily until some months ago.

Some days, even avoiding acid stuff for days I still have episodes of acid reflux. And I don't know if this might have an influence over the tapering process but the times I have reflux are highly associated with when I get very tired/thought too much on my work coming to a ""overheat"" state.

I was against taking the triple therapy, but I still have symptoms that are sometimes complicating my working days. I wonder if I do have options. I am already diagnosed with gastritis and also tested positive for h. pylori... all this before the quarentine.

If I adopt this treatment, what should I expect in terms of symptoms during benzo tapering/withdrawal? No relation? Worse? Better?

Help for nervous first timer with that method,"First off, I wanna say that I originally posted this in the benzo forum not realizing it was not a recovery forum, so I‚Äôm reposting my question here. I‚Äôm sorry if u see this twice, I promise I‚Äôm not trying to double dip. I just don‚Äôt want to offend people who really need to use benzos to survive the horror of life and felt this was more appropriate 

Hi everyone, 

I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read my post. I‚Äôm going to skip the whole multi paragraph autobiography about how I ended up here. The tl;dr is I was using klonopin under dr orders to mitigate horror and finish the end of my sub taper.

This was all under doctors guidance. I explained to him that I can‚Äôt be on benzo‚Äôs long-term because I have a high tolerance and the whole kindling effect gets me dependent quickly. However, We needed to use klonopin to mitigate a very long sub taper‚Äôs effects but now I‚Äôm at .18 and feel ready to jump.

He promised me that as soon as I was done with my sub taper he would put me on a Librium taper to get off the kpin. I am turning here because there is from what I can tell no easily accessible info about Librium to benzo taper I can find on the internet. Nothing reliable anyway.

Regardless, he claims that I am still in for a lot of psychological pain because he says that he‚Äôs going to come back big  time even with the Lib. That very well may be the case but the fact is I have to get clean or I‚Äôm going to end up in a medical detox. Which I can‚Äôt afford.

SO my dosage on kpin right now is ~2.5mg a day. He was planning on prescribing me 25 mg three times a day. I know that counts to about 1.5mg of kpin. SO...

- Does anyone here have experience with Librium being used to get you off kpin?

- was it therapeutically effective?

- I am worried about simply getting cross addicted to librium. Should I just blast my kpin out of my system that first week and then quickly taper off the Librium? 

- does it build up in your system to where that dosage sounds like it makes sense? 

- He seems to think it will take a month but I have been in detox that uses pheno and aside from four or five days of classic symptoms after leaving treatment, I was free from benzos days later. 

- Basically I am being a big baby but I‚Äôve been going through a LOOOOONG and grueling taper from the subs. I need a break. I don‚Äôt need to spend the next four months tapering off Librium Since the entire syndrome I‚Äôm trying to avoid right now. Isn‚Äôt my alpha gaba receptor gig going to be just as fucked up when I‚Äôm off?

 I don't know if a wire going through the top left side of my brain and out the roof of my mouth really describes it cause it doesn't hurt. The feeling/symptom is just really terrifying, causes alot of panic, and is agitating more that it is painful.

 I feel like I wanna take a hammer to my brain and just tare out the part where I feel it.

 The feeling recently has started to cause pressure in my left ear. The feeling is in a really concentrated location. I don't feel it in the morning but it comes around 7 pm, and lasts for four hours usually, or sometime all day.

 The time in which it occurs has changed over the past two months.

 Please does anyone have an explanation or has had similar experience?

 I'm so scared it's permanent brain damage and it will never go away.",2

I took it everyday 2mg a day for a month. I know what withdrawal is since I've been doing so since I was 17 which I'm 27 from opiates. I talked to my doctor that I was having symptoms of withdrawal and she said that it was impossible since I'd only been on it for a short while. Well first of all no. I know that's wrong cause our body can get physically addicted fast. So I came off it with the help of L theanine and Ashwagahnda which helped with the moodyness and lathargy. The withdrawal lasted about a week but after that no symptoms except maybe more anxiety. so I have PTSD. Like bad. Can't even drive, sometimes cant even go outside, heart races just to use the restroom. This whole covid thing has been bad for my mental health and always think I'm gonna get sick or have brain cancer or something. Went to the ER the yesterday cause I felt like my chest was gonna explode and had this weird pain in my upper stomach. Which I'm pretty sure was just a panic attack and some ulcer pain I had. After getting done with the ER my doctor decides to put my back on my benzo but instead of lorazepam 1 mg twice a day she has me taking the clonazapam .50mg PRN as needed. I'm scared to take it. Because of what happened last time but honestly I really need it as a prn. I just don't want to have the withdrawal..is there any routine or advice people can give me that won't put me into withdrawal or addicted?? Any and all advice will be helpful. Thank you",2

When I hit 10mg a day, I had this very strange headache. My entire body started to feel numb, the skin. I was driving home and could hardly tell where the gas and break were. I called an ambulance and went to the ER. They ruled out a stroke. I had more numbness on my right side. The numbness eventually faded within several hours. It didn't prepare me for what came next. It was shear hell and torture. Over the next few days my entire body was swarmed with parathesia. It felt like hit needles or painful vee stings non stop. I couldn't sleep through the pain. I even tried to take hydroxyzine and it didn't work. Then electric jolts or currents shot striaght down my spine into my arms. My ulnar nerves buzzed with ferocity. For the next two months I could only manage 1-3 hours of sleep always waking up after 1 hour. I was covered in sweat. I held that dose for 4 months but symptoms didn't ease. The morphed into other shitty things. Depression, crying spells, suicidal ideation. I eventually tapered some more. Down to 9mg now. Sleep has improved but now nerve pain covers my body. Electric zaps shoot all over. My memory is gone, I'm confused half the time. 

By far this is the most horrendous drug to be on. I've only been on it for 3 years. For panic attacks. Now those seemingly pesky attacks were replaced by a horrendous overactivity of glutamine, causing massive disruptions in my body.",5

TL:DR on klonopin for 3 years prescribed by pill happy, side effect ignorant docass. Changed to an inexperienced docass who ripped me off the meds literally believing I'd go through no more than 2 weeks of withdrawal. Now almost 2 years later I still struggle to think. Memory is still SUPER spotty, feel like my episodic memory is non-existent. Last 2 years feel like a blur, intense depression (a lot of suicidality still)- working my way off zoloft now as well has me thinking I'm prolonging the benzo withdrawal?

Curious to hear if anyone else has issues this far out? I've tried to stay away from this sub lately because in the beginning reading about it seemed to make it worse but I'm really trying hard to return to my pre-med self if it's even possible...or am I now just a brain-damaged invalid who blew half his 20s on anxiety and the other half on psych med withdrawal. 

\-----------------------------

Been going through a very tumultuous period in my mental health journey the last 2 years. In a way I like to think I'm burning everything down to build it back up new again (unwillingly but it's the most optimistic view I have on it)

Was having perceived trouble in 2015, life long anxiety/depression since puberty. Went to see a psych, got thrown on Zoloft and Klonopin. Next year that same psych threw me on some stimulants as well. This combo helped immensely for a few years. Graduated undergrad, started a business out of school, went to grad school at the same time. Things 'felt' better socially even though my friendship circle In 2018 however, I started having a LOT of cognitive issues reoccurring/beginning, things like memory issues, increased suicidality (please save the hotline replies lol), trouble concentrating even though I was on dexedrine, and overall growing brain-fog and inability to strategize.

Saw another psych later that year when my first decided to go to another state. The new one was inexperienced, she took me off klonopin way too quick even though I was on it almost daily for a few years at that point. My mental health fell off a cliff. I was like a deer in headlights for 6 months and couldn't even answer a phone call, text or email without having a panic attack. All while still being on 200mg of Zoloft (upped from 150 by her as well). The klonopin withdrawal is a whole story on its own, but I could tell my psyche/brain had been immensely damaged. Had to let the business fizzle out as I tried to recover my sanity...unsuccessfully so far.

About 6 months later things started clearing up a little, but still having increased suicidality, confusion, memory issues (short term, event-based, even long term). I was still living in a massive fog. I decided to wean my way off Zoloft as well in April of 2019. I'm here a year later at 25mg now rather than the 200mg I was on. Each drop has caused a whole host of issues as well but they seem to resolve as my brain gets used to it. I got back on dexedrine July of 2019 and since then been on and off but mostly on still at like 5-10mg every other day. Got a job close to where I live in IT reluctantly just to pay off some of the debt from the business. I'm almost still too depressed because of what happened to continue with the business, there's this big emotional block stopping me from pursuing it any further. Mainly regret and self doubt, that I can't do these things without a benzo an ssri and a stimulant coursing through my veins.

Overall, the memory issues are still pretty present, the suicidality is still pretty ugly, though controllable. The brain fog is still very very present, I can think somewhat clearly after a long period of aerobic exercise, but it's short-lived. The depression is very on and off, but the farther I get from the drop the easier it is to control. I've been seeing a CBT guy the last 2 years during all of this but he's, in fact, witnessed my deterioration rather than my restoration. The last 3 years feels like a \*complete\* blur other than this story I keep telling myself.

I seem to constantly be retelling myself and reddit this story in an effort to gain insight, but all insight I gain from books or reading seems to go in one ear, stick for a day or so, then go out the other and not stick around. I can't tell if this is advanced adhd now or maybe OCD related but I'm really worried about my future. I'm in an IT job unrelated to what I studied, still live with my parents at 26, every job I apply to I haven't gotten a response. I'm terrified to continue to go off my med even though I have a deep gut feeling a lot of problems will resolve once my brain gets used to not having an SSRI blunting emotion and feeling any longer. Maybe even the memory issues will resolve.

I appreciate anyone who takes a look at this contextual puzzle, really just throwing my situation out into the universe even though retelling my story over and over again is probably the last thing I should be doing. I'm just so concerned with how my brain is functioning (or rather lack of functioning compared to how clear I used to think). Coronavirus isn't helping much but it still feels like the least of my issues and that my problems will probably outlive this crisis, unfortunately.",1

Those who have been using longer/ higher dose you all are truly warriors for making the effort or exploring the idea of quitting. I see some of the strongest people here. What worked for me is as follows : for the 4 weeks I rapid tapered I took 6000 mgs of niacin, 1000 mgs of vitamin C, 750 mgs of GABA, 1400 mgs of magnesium, 30 mgs of CBD, 5000 Iu of vitamin d.  1 gallon of water daily and melatonin nights when I couldn't sleep.

2020-05-05 20:41:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ge9x51/quitting/,Quitting,"I'm 3 days into quitting benzos. I've been taking on average half a bar of pressed Xanax every day for the past 6 months, and I'd been taking benzos on and off for the past 4 years. What further complicated the situation for me is I have a fucked up stomach and Xanax all but cured it. I was pretty much ready to say ""fuck it"" and accept being addicted to benzos for the rest of my life, but in the back of my mind I was always terrified of developing Alzheimer's.

I was at one point prescribed Klonopin but I've since moved and haven't gotten my prescriptions sorted out here, so I've been buying Xanax from a dealer. But then he ran out and I desperately texted pretty much everyone I knew who might have a lead on any benzos. Nobody came through and that's when I realized I'd need to taper and quit. So I went from half a bar to a quarter bar a day for about a week, and then from there pretty much just stopped.

The first day sucked royally. No appetite, anxiety out the ass. Come nighttime I was experiencing waves of every emotion under the sun, but most of all: horniness! I swiped on Tinder for the first time in ages and occupied myself with dumb conversations. That's when I realized wow, benzos definitely dull your emotions in the long term (who would've thought).

Then I started getting a terrible headache that grew worse by the minute. Pretty soon I had to close my laptop because the light was hurting my head too much, and even the flash of an advertisement in the corner of a webpage was too much for me. I knew I wasn't going to get much if any sleep tonight. A friend suggested I try Valerian root and by complete chance I happened to have some in my bathroom already. I took a full dropper's worth (mine is in a tincture). It tasted like concentrated dog ass but almost immediately my headache started to fade and I got tired! Eventually I fell asleep and woke up the next morning feeling pretty crappy, but some more Valerian root instantly calmed my stomach and my head.

I spent a lot of that day (yesterday) reading r/benzorecovery stories, which solidified for me that I need to make this a permanent step--not a tolerance break. I've ""quit"" benzos 3 or 4 times before and am aware of the kindling effect and also that for me, there's no such thing as being a casual benzo user because I just like them too much. I'll fall into the same trap of ""okay just this once"" leading to ""okay I'll be a benzo user forever."" Later that day a friend texted me back and said he had some bars for me, but I told him I didn't need them. I'd gotten a couple things done that day I'd been putting off forever and I was feeling good, even in the midst of my withdrawal.

Today I woke up and felt great. And my stomach feels better than ever! I'm ready to stop being addicted to this horrible class of drugs and find peace and calm within myself. Thanks for reading



TL;DR: Valerian root is a miracle drug for benzo withdrawal. I use a tincture from Herb Pharm that you can buy on Amazon (I've been taking the regular, not alcohol-free kind)",3

I bought what was supposed to be diclazepam to taper with. Last time I took Xanax was two days ago. Yesterday I took 16mg of ""diclaz"" over a few hours, intending to use it to taper. I never felt high but when I woke up today i was short of breath, having slow heartbeat, and just feeling sick and very dizzy. I'm no longer short of breath but the dizziness is worse. 

I'm on my way now to get some bars to try to do a short taper over 4 days, but I'm scared that I'm actually overdosing and not withdrawing. I feel withdrawal symptoms like hot flashes, sweats, dilated pupils, but if the diclazepam was bunk, why am I so dizzy? Is this what it feels like when you are on the verge of seizure? Dizzy like kratom overdose wobbles? I want to take a bar for relief, but I'm afraid of respiratory or cardio depression",4

I felt terrible for months. Long after I left rehab I felt like shit. Like even a year after. So I started taking benzos again, 10mg of Valium per day. Over the last year I have tapered down extremely slowly, ten percent per week, all the way from 10mg a day to 0.01 mg a day last week before I jumped. Giving my body and brain the proper time to taper and adjust has been amazing. I didn't go off the deep end when I started taking benzos again, I had this long taper plan in mind and stuck to it. I couldn't be happier with the results. I have no withdrawal symptoms at all, I've gotten great rest the past few nights, I'm not anxious, don't have restless legs, not sweating, don't feel like my entire body is about to seize up.

I feel like this is what treatment should look like for people with benzo addiction, yet doctors again and again do rapid taper and tell you to suck it up. How terrible! How could a doctor do this to someone knowing it can have permanent effects? There needs to be more outpatient long term treatment facilities specifically for benzo addiction. Most of the rehab centers are just huge insurance scams. 

If you're having a hard time I just want you to know you can do it and you can do it on your own! Don't give up. Do a long slow taper and start working on bettering yourself while you're tapering. I started going to the gym, started my own business, started going to therapy, started going to bed on time even if I couldn't sleep, eating right, drinking enough water. 

I haven't felt this great in years! I have my life back and I'm not having constant PAWS. You guys can do it!",22

It seems that my receptors are blocked out from receiving the natural gaba that my brain is generating, however a small dose of benzos unlocked them and allows them to be receptive to the natural gaba temporarily.

A little over couple years ago I got out of rehab for booze, had one week long bender when I ran out of Zans, but thats it since then.

After 60 days sober 2 years ago I recalled where I got my benzos a few years prior,  lost a lot when I took them then, but of course it would be different I thought. Began getting ksalos (Serb 1mg xanax) and taking 2 x 3 times a day, after 6 months I was taking about 15 a day and end of last summer it was 8 at a time 4 times a day and not unusual to take more. Friends encouraged it so it became a free habit, I ate them like M&Ms

Fast forward to the end result, but I was a complete time bomb on them. Benzos made me arrogant and would max my anger into a xan rage and I lost 3 GF‚Äôs, 3 jobs, nearly all old time friends and family wanted no part of me. I was the guy that didn‚Äôt notice others would leave the room when I walked in. Trust me, you wouldn‚Äôt of liked me.

I don‚Äôt remember any of the hospital trips, but all were result of wellness checks as I apparently did call a couple friends each time and babbled gibberish. I got in 4 fender benders driving, every time cops showed and never sobriety tested till last which involved the same cop that found me on first 2 trips and was arrested for DUI due to being in and out of consciousness for 3 days and driving to local grocery store barely able to walk as I didn‚Äôt realize my kidneys were failing...10am on a weekday. Same cop that narcaned me on #2 when face down in a pool of blood in my kitchen after a friend just happened to stop by, as if that wasn‚Äôt enough to wake me up and I never thought I could top it, but I had a desire to keep pushing.

I had bumped into a car when parking which led someone to call me in, lucky it was this cop that knew my history. On the way to be booked after not remembering the prior 3 days, I lost consciousness as my kidneys were shutting down and didn‚Äôt know it. The cop bypassed booking and took me to an ER and I was quickly transferred to another larger hospital with a kidney wing. I don‚Äôt recall 2 days. Was in the hospital 10 days (2 days and 3 days previous stays) and on day 3 had a port attached to my chest and began dialysis as my kidneys needed a jump star. Left after 10 days with a leg swollen due to a condition common when theres extensive lethargy and sleeping in unusual positions. Worst part was my nut swelled up to the size of a softball and had a line leading into a piss bag I got to limp around as I learned to walk again. Still doing PT cuz a pinched nerve, but its almost done and 100%. I was in terrific condition prior to this and athletic in general.

Told I was gonna have possible 8-10 weeks doing 3 days a week outpatient dialysis when I left. Then things have just gotten weird for me. I guess almost dying changed me. I can‚Äôt recall anything more than minor frustration and no anger in this time, the massive ego I used to have has been replaced with this thing called humility, and friends and family all actually want me around. After only 3 times in outpatient dialysis I was notified that I was to go see doctor, my kidneys had come back online and I quickly showed signs of recovering faster than any had anticipated. Multiple doctors told me in the hospital I‚Äôll die if I use again and had I not gone to grocery store and taken another nap I had a good chance of not waking up, so I think getting arrested saved my life, I never did get charged for a bonus prize. Somehow I avoided legal charges.

So I realized I‚Äôve got 3 months and I know a lot of people struggle for a while getting off this. I didn‚Äôt sleep more than 4 hours every 2-3 days for first 2 weeks. After a month I began getting 5 hours a day. I didnt have anxiety before I took xanax, I had a couple minor panic attacks and it was a horrible month of not wanting to go anywhere but hide in my room with blinds closed and lights shut.

I think we‚Äôre all biologically different so react somewhat similar, but overall reset to normalcy will vary significantly. Without realizing it until I read more on here a week or so ago I realized I felt great, was getting 7-8 hours sleep, walking and getting out and wasn‚Äôt afraid of going out, even the grocery store I was arrested. Cops all know my car, and coincidences that set me up for that DUI I never got saved my life. For me it‚Äôs taken a little under 3 months to get back to whatever the new me is, I‚Äôve been on something or another for 25 years. It‚Äôs nice remembering things, not wasting money on hookers calling themselves strippers, having people that wrote me off want me around again, not being angry, accepting everything I did, not dying is nice too, and the hope I now have.

There‚Äôs a lot of side stories I had to leave out due to length, like the bumper car I was driving, making what I thought was a great escape on that 1st wellness check by running across a barely frozen pond and cops having to throw me a rope to fish me out due to flashing lights apparently freaking me out like a stunned wild animal, and tons of other stuff. Not to mention the crazy stuff I did that I can‚Äôt remember, and somehow did every drug in the book except mdma. Feel free to ask anything. I don‚Äôt want to go back to any of it.",20

I'm way too over stress to help other without a downer.. I know it's bad, but almost 2 month dayli use arpund 1 mg clonazepam, or 2 mg etilozam... sometime  more.

I'm slowly tapering. Won't get my clonazepam script soon, at best next week probably more. Only had a few left. I will ask my doc for gabapentin or pregabalin instead, not sure he will. He want me to use antipsychotic instead. Waiting for an etiz order, if I'm lucky it will come tommorow or in a few days.

Is high l teanine dose help? Magnesium- calcium?
What others supp can help? Fasoracetam seem to help to upregulate gabba, but with crazy shipping delay, it will be more useful in recovery.

Is low dose seroquel 25 mg  helping too?

Kratom help a bit with anxiety but since I'm also a dayli user not that much. I'm also on lamotrigine, wich is a antiseizure med also use for bipolar ( why I use it).",2

I still have like 60 left, gifted a few to friends. Im gonna document my use now

I started off by doing 0.25mg then the next day 1mg then the day after 0.25mg, then I did like 0.125-0.25mg every other day until last (or this weeks depends on when you read this) monday

On monday I did 1mg + 2mg Etizolam, the day after I did just 0.5mg + 1mg Etizolam, the day after that 1.5mg Clonazolam and 3mg Etizolam, then I had 1 day break in which I honestly didnt feel any rebound neither withdrawals on Friday I did 2mg Clam cause I ran out on my Amitriptyline for sleep.

I just cant sleep without it, now I have it again. Yesterday I did 0.6-0.7mg + 3.5mg Zopiclone.

am I fucked now? or will it be fine for me to go cold turkey after 18 days of basically using every other day (I know the dosages are kinda fucked high)

If I should taper this how do I approach this? I think I'd do it really rapidly cause my time of usage wasnt really that long and frequent. Maybe dose 0.25-0.3mg every second day and keep trying to lower it? Im afraid this will just make it worse cause its more time doing them.

If I was able to fall asleep. I would be woken up by the worst nightmares. The classic pop up sweating and panting. Sometimes I'd  have to jump off the bed and just grab on to something to come back to reality. Sometimes this would happen multiple times a night.

It felt like I was just running for my life. I'm guessing this is what people experience when they get shot with an epi-pen. 



The adrenaline does wear down after 30min to an hour but the shock lasts longer and it's unbearable sometimes.

I'm down to 3mg of klonopin after abusing xanax quite heavily. 

I also abused it multiple times throughout 10+ years so I've rekindled my brain many times. 


I try to do breathing techniques but that's the last thing on my mind when it seriously feels like I've just been chased by a psychopath or demon trying to kill me.


Any tips? I'd like to add my muscles get extremely tight. I already take a boatload of supplements but would magnesium glycinate help?
