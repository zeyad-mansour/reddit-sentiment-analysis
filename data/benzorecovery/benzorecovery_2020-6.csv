But Later I got a 50 pack of 1mg Lorazepam from the doctor for myself and used this up over about 2 weeks while still occasionally taking xanax as well as a barbiturate. After that I had my first withdrawal, it really wasn't bad tho. I just felt a bit tense for 2 to 3 days after stopping it. I used a lot of drugs, but GABA drugs were probably my biggest problem.

A few months later, about a year ago I got a Clonazepam prescription from my doctor because I felt really depressed. I told myself to only use it 4 weeks MAX. So I took about 3 to 4mg on average a day and used up about three bottles with 100 0.5mg pills each after 25 days. The Clonazepam had a weird effect on me, often making me really manic and restless, I felt like I wanted to move mountains. It got to the point where I drank some beers in the evening to stop this restlessness (I know not very smart) which I did about the last 10 days I used Clonazepam. I thought I was fine after stopping after 25 days, but after realizing I was physically dependend already I was devistated and got another bottle. After talking to a few doctors one convinced me to go into a clinic to withdrawal there. I decided to stop cold turky after this conversation (I was aware of the risks) only drinking at night to be able to sleep until I can go to the clinic. The withdrawal was quite intense, I had horrible panic and slight hand tremors (probably from the alcohol). In the clinic they just gave me an antiepileptic without any taper and I was normal after about 2 week from going cold turky.

Up to now I actually took them as prescribed, but the last one is rather stupid I have to admit. I lied to myself that I can control benzos now and bought some Flunitrazolam, a super potent benzo online. I was able to use it sparingly for a month, but it quickly turned into daily for maybe a month. I went from using 0.5mg daily to 2mg daily, and this stuff is about 8 to 10 times as potent and lasts twice as long as xanax. Over this month I became so depressed from it, the only reason I got into withdrawal was because I couldn't even get myself to get out of my bed and take it. About 12 hours after the last dose the withdrawal kicked in. The first night was super intense, I saw almost psychedelic patterns in my room, on the second day I went borderline psychotic and contemplating suicide because it was so horrible. After that it wore off and 6 days after the last dose I surprisingly was normal again and spend the day writing an Erowid report about it.

Anyway, today it's about 3 months after the last withdrawal. I had a dentist appointment today of which I was really scared and took 2 2.5mg Lorazepam which I had saved up exactly for that reason. I think after the Lorazepam wore off, I started  seeing some slight weird tracers and dancing lines between lines of text. This didn't happen earlier with 5mg Lorazepam. I only got these rebound effects from Flunitrazolam and Clonazolam (it was so bad I only used it once). I mean I'm not that concerned, I never had a seizure, but I'm aware that every GABA drug withdrawal causes some permanent damage to the GABA-Glutamate systeme. I plan on never using them again besides maybe some dentist appointments, I don't wanna cause more damage. 

Maybe some here experienced something similar or know more about it then me, if that's the case, I would love to read it!",12

Almost exactly a year ago, I was a severe alcoholic. When I tried to stop drinking cold turkey, I got very sick, and wound up in the ER exhibiting some nasty withdrawal symptoms. The attending physician sent me home with a script for a Librium taper. I did the taper, and then stopped drinking. I don’t remember it being particularly rough, but my memory is shit.

A few months later, I started seeing a new psychiatrist. I’m a former Marine/Iraq Vet, and I had been having terrible anxiety, and the occasional panic attack. He prescribed, along with some other meds, two mg of Klonopin a day. 

He and I both agreed that this wasn’t to be a permanent thing. Over the past few months, I’ve been able to taper myself down to 1.5mg a day, and some days I can even get by on 1mg. 

Here’s where things get weird: even before COVID hit, I started having issues with this doc. He was unprofessional in many ways that I’m not going to waste my time writing about, but the big issue was: When I needed a refill, sometimes I couldn’t get ahold of him for days. 

I always made sure to give him headroom by calling about a refill well ahead of time. It didn’t matter, though; often, I would go two or three days out of klonopin, which fucking blows. (And no, I wasn’t abusing it). 

So I gave up on him, and yesterday had my first appointment with a different doc. I told her that I’m thirty seven years old, and I’m tired of feeling like an old man  — I wanted to come off the Benzo World Tour. Could we do a taper? 

She said sure. But instead of Klonopin, she prescribed me Librium (my old buddy from a year ago). Have any of you ever taken Librium to come off benzos? The taper plan she gave me is:

***Day 1 (today): 50mg twice a day.
Day 2-4: 25mg twice a day.
Day 5 and on, until the bottle is empty: 25mg once a day. ***


I just want to know, has anyone else here been through this type of taper? Anything to watch out for Anything you can say that will give me some hope that this will work out?


Thanks, and love ya’ll. Stay safe out there.",2

so i broke down my diazepam dosage from 30mg/day or more to this minimum dosage:  


day 1: 2,5mg of diazepam because i felt bad even while on xanax

  
day 2: taking less xanax and took 2,5mg diazepam, i feel really afraid and depressed.

i know that when i take 0 benzos, when i really be out of them, it will be way worse, right????  
is there any path from here, to lesser damage?

benzos are not the only drugs i used, i did LSD and Weed a lot and that is what caused me a panic attack and drove me into benzos, and now i need to minimize these withdrawals or i fear i might lose my life, lose my mind, end my life or end my goals.

I am now at 0.75mg and the most weird symptoms (or at least I hope they are just due to taper/wd) are making my life miserable. My last cut was 4 weeks ago where I was at 1mg of Valium. Almost 4 months ago I was at .125mg of Xanax + 2.5mg of Valium and then I dropped Xanax... first weeks were hell and I wonder if that drop 4 months ago is influencing my symptoms tapering the rest of the Valium.

I took CBD oil 5 days ago to help with the symptoms but I felt very bad. Tried 3 days and seems like I can't use this on tapering.

I am feeling pretty bad these last days and I am not sure if it's only wd or if I damaged my brain: there is a burning feeling that I would not describe as a headache at 2 or 3 points inside my head in the right temple are that are constantly annoying me. It was episodic before an episode of a high from CBD oil where I tried a full dropper and my BP reached 170/100 with me feeling pretty bad.

As I said, I am taking 0.75mg of Valium. Where I live the smallest dose is a pill of 5mg of Valium. What I am doing is to 'titrate': I have a plastic bottle where I put a whole pill with 50ml of water and then I use a syringe to take the desired dose (7.5ml in my case).

I wasn't even a heavy user nor used for a long long time: I started using benzos 1 year and a half ago and at the peak I was taking 1.5mg of Xanax daily.

I am considering updosing my Valium to half a pill (2.5mg) as I don't know if I can trust this titration method I am doing.

I am not living my life: can't watch tv, can't play videogames, can't read... I already took a medical license to take some days from my job.

Currently in a clinic in Germany going through a kind of hell on earth.

How did I get here?
Back at the beginning of March, I was prescribed 2mg Ativan/Tavor with 10mg Valium for 2 months by my GP for an isolated anxiety episode back in March.

When I tried to get off the medication and realized how dangerous the physical dependency could be, I experienced severe rebound effects. My GP was not aware that we were playing with fire.

After I informed myself about what was going on I got help from a local psychiatric clinic and they asked me to get off the benzo in less than 4 weeks. I went through hell doing this but couldn’t complete it. I ended up checking into a clinic in the German Black Forest who had the expertise to get me through a taper and over a further 6 weeks and a switch to Oxazepam I took the final dose.

By this point I was a wreck and was taking adjunct medications for sleep and occasionally during the day for agitation. During the 6 weeks the adjunct medications and my stress levels which were constantly at hyper-arousal led to blockage of my nose so that I had difficulty breathing or had to mouth breathe.

I thought that the last dose would be it and afterwards it would be upwards to sunny uplands. What happened instead was that a few days later I started to get more extreme symptoms than I had ever experienced during the taper. Incredible restlessness and agitation so that I couldn’t sit still, burning and prickling sensations in my arms. My mood was also swinging as I became desperate about my state and a realization dawned that I was not through by a long chalk.

Including the taper I was on benzos for 15 weeks.

Current Status

It is now two and a half weeks after the last dose and I am at my wit’s end and am losing hope. I am so uncomfortable and depressed. I have some of the best experts in Germany caring for me and they assure me that I am still in acute withdrawal and that I will get out of this. They are ramping up Gabapentin to help me cope with the symptoms and I am starting Escitalopram for the depression. I have a sleeping medication as well (Dominal). I know that these will take time to help me and in the meantime I am unable to function. I am starting to believe, however, that I am mad and will never get better. I have great support from family and friends and everybody says that I need to take it day-to-day and believe.

I know many people here have long term usage of a benzo and seem to deal with this better than me. I am a very sensitive person and a tendency to overthink and worry which doesn’t help. A work colleague of mine said to me last week that prior to this episode I lived with so much intensity - intense happiness, intense work, intense relationships - that this very intensity is now making your recovery so much worse.

Has anybody else experienced anything like this? I need some hope.",5

First of all, I’m a nurse... and I used Xanax for a short period of time

Then use it again for a couple days then stop for about 3 days 

Used it for about 20 days in a row, and only did it for about... 2 months in total with 20 days being the longest consecutive time. 
I took 0.5/day sometimes (very rarely) 1MG.
I still have had W/D symptoms. 
Mine have mostly been neurological, along with that muscle tension. 
My legs would feel so tight, and so would my arms. It was weird, nothing like I’d ever felt before. 

Feeling very foggy, 
Very heavy. My arms and legs especially. That has eased up. 
Initially I was very fatigued, and would hate walking, I just felt so heavy... 

Now I’m about 33 days off of it, and I feel dizzy and unsteady, and still intermittently foggy. 

I did have some alcohol a few times, and it did make things worse each time... (even being a nurse I didn’t realize the association until after the fact.... 🙃) 

I never recommend these to anyone because of the propensity for addiction. 
I realize they are very helpful, but they are also very dangerous, as I am having these symptoms after a short time of use.

On day 5, I took a nap and woke up with unexplainable anger. I went to sleep a few hours later and slept for 24 hours, it was weird but didn't give it much thought. On day 8, I went to bed and just never got out for 3 days. When I finally got up, I had cold sweats, no appetite, nausea, muscle pains. Called my doctor who said it was likely flu and arranged a covid test as a precaution, it was negative. I had a very short sleep on night 12 but assumed that was down to my previous long hibernation. Last night (13) I did not sleep at all, complete insomnia. 

It has now been 14 days since I last took my 2mg of diazepam, the penny finally dropped that I may be going through withdrawal. I did some googling and it all fits which brings me here...

I've tried to take a nap this afternoon but with no success, I feel tired but it's like like my mind is racing and sleep won't happen again tonight. I also still have little appetite. Can anyone offer advice on how to proceed. Should I take a smaller dose of say 1mg to try and get a rested sleep tonight? Or am I nearing the end of the worst and should continue riding it out? My doctor is closed over the weekend so can't get his advice until Monday.

Any nuggets of wisdom would be appreciated.",3

The pain starts behind the bridge of my nose and and can often spread out around my face. The pain is simultaneously a 'boring' sensation and as if two layers of my 'inner face' are being pulled apart but are being prevented from doing so fully by a sensation of 'glue'. None of the doctors in the country I live in (Taiwan) can explain this even though it seems like it would actually be very simple to explain based on my history. No conventional medications work or, if they do slightly, the side effect are unbearable. Everyone always says that time heals all benzo-related issues but, in my case, this is not true: there has been no let up for 2.5 years. Just to receive a diagnosis would, I feel, go some way to reducing my anxiety surrounding this issue - and maybe even the pain itself - but I can't find anything anywhere to help me understand what is happening or what, if anything, I can do. If anyone has any insights they would be enormously appreciated. Thank you for reading.",1

Need advice.,"I've been taking clonazepam & temazepam for around a year and a half now. My dosages have increased and I was taking it not as prescribed. I averaged 1-2 times a week, and ended up at 1.5mg doses of the clonazepam, and 90mg doses of the temazepam. I never exceeded twice a week until last week, where I took it three times in a row with a small mix of alcohol (1-2 beers). 

I decided to stop taking them as I no longer felt like I was taking them for my prescribed purposes, and my anxiety and panic attacks have been gone for the past 3 months and my insomnia was better. This may be due to the medications somehow working, even though I was taking them wrong, but I legitimately also believe that I personally improved in those avenues on my own. I stopped them cold turkey because I wouldn't even know how to taper when I'm taking them twice a week at max.

I'm currently on day 5 of no benzodiazepines and I'm quite uncomfortable. Day 1-3 I had pretty much no symptoms but insomnia, and now I'm at the point where I'm having muscle spasms, I'm sleeping 2-3 hours a day, and I eat one small meal. I'm actually not having much rebound anxiety and no panic attacks. My main concern is what is the chances of me having a seizure? Should I push through this? I realize it might get worse in the next week. Should I think about finding a tapering schedule regardless? I'm feeling like I can get through this.",4

I was clean of benzos until May 9 (On the graph you can see the doses I have taken since then), I started to take benzos again because I wasn't feeling good, yeah, I know it's stupid, but in combination with abstinence several things have happened in my life that made me take again.  
I don't feel the withdrawal has worsened, I just haven't seen any improvements. Did I screw up or are the isolated doses not so harmful? I don't plan to make it a habit, I don't want to suffer because of this as I did.

Sorry for my English.

Should i go to the Dr/ER?","The first month i used like 1mg Xanax per day in order to cope with my Kratom WD. (With 2-3 days where i went up to 3-7mg in between)
The next month i used like 0,75-3mg xanax and/or up to 20-50mg Diazepam varying from day to day due to anxiety and on some occasions for stimulant comedowns. (
It was 70 days in total and in the last week i switched completely to Diazepam and dropped from 50 - 20- 20 - 50 - 25 - 5 mg the last days.
Now i ran out 4 days ago and took a shitload of hydroxyzine/CBD and some tillidine today to cope with anxiety/WD sympoms(?)
As i was drinking and doing some coke the first 2 days when i ran out maybe the depression/anxiety and that i couldn‘t get out of the bed for those days maybe that wasn‘t benzo WD yet.
But since yesterday i have a stiff neck, crampy hands/feet, sometimes a headache and some accoustic hallucinations here and there (like my phone was ringing). Anxiety is also through the roof as well as my heartrate. Also some derealisation and i can’t think straight and am really restless.
The CBD/hydroxyzine/tilidine helps but I can‘t stop thinking about my fear of seizing.


I thought i could get more diazepam for my rapid taper but it‘s unsure if i get it tomorrow, monday or never. (But i guess it would be at least on monday)

In how much trouble am I now?
Is this seizure territory yet or is it possible to push this CT through?
As I really fear seizing I‘m thinking about getting to an Addiction Dr tomorrow or to the ER.
But i would like to avoid that if possible and would only go if it‘s absolutely necessary.

I‘m invited to 2 Events today and tomorrow where there‘ll be alcohol involved. Could that potentiate the risk of seizing or are 3-4 beer ok?

I only have 1 zolpidem tablet left in case of seizure if that helps...

I‘d be really grateful for some advice!",3

Now I had a pretty high tolerance it would of been common enough for me to eat 150mg or more of diazepam at some of the worst times. I never myself went to rehab, instead I just tried to pretend to everyone I was fine and only ever told 3 people about it but I largley downplayed how bad it was when I told them, everyone could tell obviously tho but I eventually managed to quit on my own, I slowly done a self taper, then in the last week of taper I picked up 100mg of Alprazolam powder and went through it in a week, went cold turkey from there and the withdrawals were hell, as I'm sure you all know. 

Now I'm trying to help be here for this girl while her family member is having this problem and do what I can but as much as I should be able to know what to say and suggest Im actually drawing blanks, I told her all about my experience with benzo addiction in full detail, something I've never done before, my logic was shell understand I know what it's like and that she can talk to me and give her hope that it can work out. Now she did say that meant a lot and she really appreciated it and it made her feel better so that's a start at least, however when it comes to talkin about it I don't think I really know the right things to say and suggest. 

Any advice on how to handle this and help her and her family member as well I don't really know her long enough to help the person directly, never met the person but I lost 2 years of my life to benzos and what I went through on them I wouldn't wish that on anyone so I want to do all I can to help. I did say look I know it's probably too soon and not what you'll want but that if she ever wanted me to talk to the person since I can relate I would do that. Figured I should at least ofter.

After a long dilemma of trying or not cbd oil while tapering, I decided to take it after a series of days of intense waves.

One person in the benzobuddies forum told me that my waves could be due to the fact that I was taking a quarter of the 5mg pill of Valium checking the divisions/parts in the ""eyeball"". With this quarter, I was titrating to get. 75mg using a dropper. His advice for me was to stabilize the quantity using a whole pill and a syringe before trying cbd oil or any change in my regimen, because probably my waves were occuring due to these residual variations.

I was suffering a bunch yesterday and I decided to try CBD to get a relief and live a more normal life: I can't even watch TV or play videogames lately. I tried half a dropper by night. I felt some relief and felt ok.

Today, before the launch, I took another half of a dropper cause I was starting to feel anxious. It was ok.

But then I decided to buy some stuff in the super market and I felt like shit. I wasn't thinking properly, my mom asked me something and I did other thing... I was really uncomfortable and feeling that my BP was high. Back home I checked and it was 160/90. My obsessions also started to skyrocket, and with this I felt super depressed. WTF. I don't know if I blame the oil, or the innacurate taper, or even the stomach issues (mild gastritis and h. pylori) still untreated.

Now I don't even know what to do: should I insist in trying the oil for couple days? Should I raise my Valium dosage and start my taper again from this dosage? Should I treat h. pylori first?

I am having unbearable experiences every day feeling like torture and I am starting to make my parents depressed. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",1

If I am effectively going into withdrawals everyday, then how is it that I’m not kindling everyday, since when I take my dose at my scheduled time, the withdrawals abate for the most part?

I have taken benzos on and off for the past couple years but never more than a month. I had one CT about 4 months ago from Xanax but it wasn’t horrible. 

This time, it’s horrible. Took ambien for one month and then 1mg Ativan daily for another month.

2020-06-23 16:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/helyz3/my_benzo_experience_and_tips/,My Benzo Experience (and tips),"I've had 3 bouts with benzos:  

First time, I took 1 mg xanax 3x day for 8 weeks.  Graduate school was stressful.  I abruptly stopped the meds and had bad withdrawals for 4 days.  After the last day, I was OK. 

Second time, I took 1 mg Klonopin 3x day for 3 years.  When I finally decided to get off, I went down from 3 mg to 1 mg in only 1 day with the help of Gabapentin.  That medication helps make up the difference for lower benzo doses.  I don't know how it works exactly, but the second week of my taper, I was on 1 mg Klonopin a day with 900 mg gaba and feeling just fine - almost too good in fact.  But like an impatient addict, one day I stopped the Klonopin completely.  For the next 45 days, I didn't feel good.  My skin was crawling, major headaches, etc.  I was also taking high doses of gaba at this point, and it did help a lot.  Gabapentin helped control the little explosions in my head which was super helpful.  After the 3rd month, I was nearly 100% back to normal.  I did work a busy job during this time too - a high travel job where I had to fly around the country in small planes.  Talk about anxiety. sheesh.  But, I did it. 

Third time was last year.  I took 1 mg Klonopin 2x day for 18 months.  This time, the withdrawals were much, much more severe.  I don't know why...maybe getting older, etc.  But it took me 3-4 months before I could really be productive.  That was difficult.  

So, I am 10 months off Klonopin and feeling good.  I am also 15 days off suboxone and cigs, and going to keep pushing through this nightmare until I come out on the other side.  

A few tips which helped me (and some that didn't):

1. When you are ready to quit, go into your bathroom and look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself OUT LOUD that no matter what happens and no matter how bad you feel, you are NOT going to quit.  I did this and it helped especially on the days I wanted to throw in the towel. 
2. Levaquin, the antibiotic in the Cipro family, is poison when taking benzos.  Levaquin blocks the mechanism of action for benzos and can throw you into immediate withdrawals.  This happened to me a few years ago.  There isn't a ton of literature on this, but it's out there.  If you are not on benzos at all, taking Levaquin is prob ok unless there are other allergies. 
3. Baclofen was a LIFE SAVER.  If you need the edge off, get some 20mg baclofen pills.  It will help you sleep and quiet the nasty withdrawals.  Admittedly, I took a lot of baclofen in the beginning.  Think I went through 3 90 count bottles in 1 month.  But the medication is generally safe and helped with sleep.
4. The last time around, I took a lot of time off work.  Like a lot.  I needed it to heal.  I realize it's not possible in all cases, but take off as much time as you need. 
5. Finally, tell someone what is going on.  I had a very good friend of mine walk with me on the journey into wellness and it made a huge difference. 

Well, this was longer than I thought.  But hopefully it can help.",17

I take 100mg of Zoloft, I am still tapering Valium (I changed from 1mg to 0.75mg of Valium 4 weeks ago) and I do know about the CYP450 interaction. But with this episode yesterday and debilitating anxiety and mental exhaustion I was experiencing at work, I am starting to think about updosing V and I know that this is not a very good choice.

I even took 2 days off and I am sometimes thinking about quiting my job because programming and thinking too much while under these conditions is like torture.

I wonder if I should try CBD oil before updosing V, but I am afraid about making things even harder. The CBD oil I bought is full spectrum (0.3% of THC).

Took Xanax first time 2 months ago for 3 days - 0.25 a day for sleep. Quit and nothing happened. Recently I had really bad anxiety and took 0.25 a day for sleep 9 days in a row. Tapered with half that dose for 4 days but my doctor just told me to CT and jump and so did people here and on Benzobuddies. I CT and the first 4 days were hell. 

Panic attacks, extreme derealization and depersonalization, brain fog, heavy head, insomnia, shaking and sweating, numb arms and fingers, numb lips, felt like a different person. Then those faded but heart palps came, difficulty breathing and hyperventilating, some dizziness, still having arms go numb sometimes (I can use them) and overall anxiety.

I've been 14 days CT now. Is there hope for me? I did take only 3mg over the course of 13 days (taper included) and I wonder if I will heal from this hell drug. Despite all the anxiety and symptoms (had minor surgery recently but wasn't put on meds) I never had a craving for Xanax even though I have two full 30 pill bottles sitting on my desk.

2020-06-22 07:54:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/hdqzzf/my_boyfriend_desperately_needs_advice_for/,"My boyfriend desperately needs advice for tapering off Valium. UK health services do not want to help him with this process, unless he comes to the hospital withdrawing, already at risk of seizure or worse, and we are terrified and in need to help.","A few weeks ago, he tried to go cold turkey and experienced unbearable anxiety , heart palpitation/intense chest pain all day, dysphasia, extreme headaches, numbness in his arms, pains everywhere. He felt like he was dying/ having a stroke, and I called emergency services and was told his only solution was to go to hospital and wait to be seen (hours of waiting in the UK) for a Valium alternative. Due to money troubles, travel troubles combined with PTSD in a dangerous area late at night, no support from family, we couldn’t attend and instead at that time and sourced Valium for him until we could try again from a non emergency perspective.

The facts:
He has been using Valium for 3 years on and off, spending about 90% of the year on it. His doses have ranged between on average 20-40mg a day, usually around 30mg.  He’s often spiked his dosage during psychedelic trips to maintain calm, at times doubling his dose.

He’s currently on 20mg a day, for approximately 1 month. We’re attempting to taper him ourselves using an online program, however because he is trying to break up pills himself, that cannot necessarily be done to a specific dose - which is making us nervous, and of course may render our tapering program pointless.

He had a micro stroke in the past, when withdrawing from Valium, which is another reason why we have to be really careful. He also struggles with a mental health diagnosis (BPD) so this is extremely hard for him to cope with.
If anyone could offer some advice as to their experience, and perhaps even how to find professional help, it would be a huge comfort to us. We feel very alone in this process, and so this is a last resort. We literally have no idea whether his body can take this, the drug service he is enrolled to hasn’t got back to him in weeks,   or his doctor. The emergency services as I said won’t help taper him. We’re panicking, and just hearing advice from someone who may have been through this would be a huge comfort at the moment. the horrible anxiety of fearing for his life is currently making quitting substances even harder, ironically. We need to either work out a tapering program or take him to hospital when he’s at risk of his life, during a pandemic too as a high risk patient. Thank you for reading, and apologies for the over abundance of information, and upmost thanks to anyone who has any advice for us. We couldn’t find the answers on google, or via the health services and so others who have been through this are our only option now. My own drug councillor said we needed to fake a seizure in order to get the help needed. We are hoping we can find an alternative somehow.",3

My tolerance for that had gotten so bad that recently I’ve started to actually loose count of how much of everything I’m actually taking.  So, a friend of mine introduced me to Benzos, which I’ve started incorporating into my daily routine.

Each time I take my oxys I’ll add 1/2 a bar to sometimes a full bar of a yellow 2mg Xanax.

I first started to just take it at night to wind down and relax and to help me sleep. 
Then my tolerance for it grew to the point I’d take two full bars at once (4mgs total) and go home and have a few shots of Jameson.
(Yes I know that is super bad, and I have bad stories to prove it) so I’ve stopped mixing my benzos with alcohol which is why I started to incorporate them into my daily oxy routine. 

Anyway, I’m going to finally get help to get off oxys which I feel is my main problem, but at first the clinic I went to said that bc I mentioned I take benzos daily along with all that other stuff, they wanted to put me on Methadone until I’m more “stable” for Suboxone. 

My medical doesn’t cover methadone treatment so I cut myself off the benzos a few days ago to prep for my intake appointment coming up on Thursday. I started to have anxiety out of no where yesterday so ended up taking a bar. 

I’m worried that if I go to my intake appt and piss dirty for benzos they’ll turn me away from getting Suboxone?  I’ve heard different stuff from different people.",1

From a few months my thyroid levels have been withinh range, and when I did my last lab work, the thyroid levels were fine, I also tested my cortisol levels which were just a bit over the limit. During the last months, I've also been losing some weight, ~10 kg in total, and when I told this to my endo, she said that it's kinda rare for Hashimoto's patients to lose weight like this, and also, since the thyroid levels have been fine the last few months, maybe I should ask my neurologist what she thought about this, and when I did, she just told me we would be doing a head MRI, and then see what to do.

Most of my time on benzos has been with xanax and klonopin, so those are the doses I understand best. I was able to cut to 0.75mg of kpin a few months ago and switched to 10mg valium and had to up to 15mg valium and truthfully never really stabilized. 

For whatever reason, diazepam just does not work as well for my interdose anxiety as klonopin or xanax. The symptoms of w/d are different and tbh I prefer the intensity and familiarity of kpin w/d for the 3-4 hours before my nightly dose.",1

How to speed up slight withdrawal

Hello! Three main questions.

Ive been doing benzos and gabapenoids/lyrica and zopiclone for past 3 years on and off. Valium is a once year thing but i always binge. I have a tolerance from thte past use and lunesta.

1.) Last 2 weeks ive done 300mg. First week was in 2 days, one day 60mg and next day 40mg. Some lyrica in the mix few lunestas in mix. After this binge for like a week id get mad vivid dreams and borderline sleep paralysis. 

Well i made it through just vivid dreams and i guess its the after effect depresssion made me buy another strip 10x10. Finished these in 2 days, split 3 days apart. I was using dph for sleep too.

What do you guys think high chance of panic attacks? 


2.) Also antenolol a beta blocker i can get here, can that help with anxiety. Propronolol is harder to find. Anyone wondering i live in asia so its otc.

3. ) Also should i also exercise and sex for CNS rest lol.

I have Nac , magnesium citrate. and l theanine enough for a almost 2 months
 
Thanks a million.",0

Im sure there’s a million reasons I shouldn’t ....but I envy those it helps with anxiety. I also suffer from server anxiety now and again and benzos do nothing for me but suck me into a deeper whole.

With anger however, it calms me. I’m worried that this new finding will make me relapse.

I've been prescribed benzos on and off for the better part of 15 years (I'm 30yo) and I've been on kolonopin for a year; 2mg a day prescribed for my ptsd and anxiety. I had been over taking my kolonopin, not to get high because I simply don't get high from kpins, it takes my anxiety away or makes me sleep. That is why it has been chosen benzo for me after a very bad xanax addiction . while coming off methadone, I started over taking my kolonopin for sleep just to get through the withdraws. I was taking anywhere between 3 to 7mg a day depending on the day. I would run out early and buy some off the street (which I absolutely hated to do, but, seizures) and I have recently moved out of that area and have a new, awesome Dr. I was as transparent as possible with him about my kolonopin and started taking it as prescribed again without too many issues. Then I had another bout of insomnia and started taking between 3 to 7 mg at night for sleep. I did this on and off for last two months. My Dr rescued me twice, telling the pharmacy to fill my script early and I could self pay but he's pretty much had it and said he would not be willing to do that anymore. Well I got the rest of my partial prescription and over took it again , like I had no control, so I gave it to my husband to dose me. We counted out how many I had left til my next refill, and I barely had enough to take one a day (1mg) to get to my next refill (as long as my new pharmacy fills 1 to 2 days early as my last Walgreens did because my insurance approved and would cover up to two days early. My question is, am I at risk for seizures at this point? Im sorry that was long and drawn out but I wanted to give enough info to get best advice. I usually start feeling benzo WD around day 3 or 4 and I am absolutely having withdraws (day four since I've gone down to 1 mg a day) having symptoms of cold sweats, anxiety, insomnia, and a little bit of flashing lights when I blink but not as severe as I have had in the past. I'm also prescribed 1000 mg of gabapenten and have a shit ton of them because for awhile I would just get them filled and not take them. What advice do y'all have for me? Once I get my refill I plan to stay on my prescribed dose and let my husband give them to me and me not hold onto them. But until then, am I at risk for seizures? Should I take extra gabapenten to help with the withdraws? Should I tell my Dr what's happening and see if he'll increase my dose to 2mg 2x a day for a month then tirate down from there? (I have a telephone appt with him tomorrow) I'm not so sure he would be willing to do that but its worth a try. Or do you think its serious enough that I should buy some extra? Please, I am desperate and buying off the street would be absolutely last resort. Thanks y'all!",1

I was very against adding any new med or increasing my AD, but every working day I've been getting waves that feels like torture for hours.

I am at 0.75mg of Valium... I reach this by taking one quarter of the pill (5mg is the smaller dosage where I live) and using a dropper bottle and hot milk. But I am starting to suspect that I am not cutting the quarters too well or then that the milk solution is not as uniform as I tought it was... or even that the milk makes the valium loses some of the effect or properties.

My current regimen is actually 100mg of Zoloft (I started this before the benzos due to OCD) and 0.75mg of Valium.

I am considering the following options:

* CBD oil (I already have it but I was afraid to try);

* Increasing Zoloft;

* Start using Lyrica;

* Quit my job and hope that the lack of a obligation to think too much will improve substantially the quality of my life;

* Updosing Valium.

I read mixed options about using Lyrica. Do you have some success stories about people using it to quit the benzos and stoping Lyrica without a problem?

It’s mostly consisted of Etizolam but I’ve mixed in diclaz, flubro, Clam and Flualp. It has ebbed and flowed and there were a few times where I had to taper rapidly down or cold turkey for a day or two in between orders. Sometimes I would take 50mg of Etiz at once or 20mg Clam or spend a week “finger dipping” diclaz powder. Stupid, I did a lot of embarrassing stuff, most of which I don’t even remember. 

Over the past year and a half I’ve leveled out at 20-40mg of etizolam per day. Did a lot of stupid shit in this time. 

Anyways,in these last few months I’ve recklessly added heavy alcohol consumption on top of the Tiz. I’m already in recovery from alcoholism so it was unwise to fuck with RC benzos to begin with.

Two weeks ago I wound up in really bad shape and sort of spilled the beans to my family and asked for help. Landed in medical detox. They did a rapid taper over 5 days with Librium and put me on Depakote. My insurance wouldn’t cover further inpatient so I got out after those 5 days. 

My “Secret” PO Box had a shipment in it of Etiz and Clam when I got out. So I relapsed one day after getting out of Detox. Booze entered the picture again and all hell broke loose for a couple days. I felt so much shame and on Sunday morning I handed over my stash to my SO and went and canceled my P.O. Box and my bitcoin wallet.

So I basically cold-turkeyed the habit but I have the Depakote to hold off seizures. I’m getting to the end of day 3 here. My brain is unhappy with me but I am seeing the light.

Well it’s kinda funny because I started my Valium taper today after having horrible withdrawals and admitting I was an addict. I finally got what I wanted: a benzo script. I got my wish, but now I have to taper down and deal with the various consequences related to my use.

It’s built up tolerance and I started getting 0 relief and then to where I felt worse.

I have noticed the night I didnt take it, I would get high anxiety uncomfortable feelin, crippling body sensations and would turn in bed for a few hours and have super shallow sleep. What I read that Ashwagandha has GABA-A mimicking properties. 

Today I took the powder as normal and feeling fine. What do you guys suggest to do ? I know I will not be able to handle another full blown withdrawal from Ashwaganda set off ;/ I still have aneough powder or can get more ? Slowly reduce the powder dosage for a few days?

I would really appreciate you guys with some reassurance If it gets really bad with dose reduction I know I will not handle myself and probably admit myself to hospital before I do something bad to myself

We have overcome a lot, and he has worked hard. He has had some relapses before and during the pandemic, and has lost his job and having a lot of trouble finding one. 

Yesterday, we went to the beach with my family. I am always anxious around my parents, and on edge whenever with them to make sure everything is perfect (or seemingly so). I accussed him of being high while we were with my family (not in front of my family, they had no idea something was going on). He said he wasn't and was very hurt at the accusation. I didn't budge. I'd heard everything he was saying before at times that he HAD been high. I insisted on a drug test. When we got home, he took two- both negative.

I felt like an idiot. I felt like I'd totally misread the situation and felt insane. I had ruined a perfect day with anxiety. He left for a while and came back. He was feeling very hurt and depresssed because he said he was just being himself and didn't understand what he'd done for me to think he was high.

When he came back, I knew he was feeling extremely depressed and he has a history of depression. In the past, he has made bad and self-destructive choices while feeling low. When we were getting ready to watch a movie and head to bed, he insisted on going for a drive. This terrified me. I thought he would go get high. I hid the keys. He searched high and low, tearing up the house- his behavior after ""losing"" his keys made me certain that he was leaving to get high. I suggested going for a walk, to clear his head, instead of a drive. He said no, he wanted to drive. Eventually late at night he learned that I hid the keys. He was even more hurt/depressed/betrayed than before. 

I truly thought I was doing the right thing. What is wrong with me? How do I handle this? 90% of the time my instincts when it comes to drugs with him are correct. However, yesterday, when I was so sure, he passed the drug test. What the hell do I do",2

Anyway fuck my dad and my therapist for telling me to take this shit for 9 days as if it's nothing and now they don't even believe me. Fuck benzos in general. With that out of the way--

How long will I take to heal from this? How long do I watch myself for seizures since I live alone and leaving the door unlocked just in case is becoming annoying because I can't keep watch on it all day.

My symptoms are:
- apathy / emotional numbness (worst)
- tingling in face (annoying)
- feeling like I will stop breathing before falling asleep
- sweating at night
- pain in my legs (though I did pace a lot for hours every day for days while on the Xanax)
- panic and anxiety attacks
- hands and legs feel like they won't work but they do work
- depersonalization/derealization
- voice feels weird 
- had numb lips on day 2 but they haven't returned
- tired eyes

I don't have a fever, heart is ~80 bpm which is my regular, have appetite, sleeping 5-7 hours a night with dreams but I wake up every 3 hours. Every 12 hours I go from the above symptoms to feeling good and back to the symptoms.

Will this get better? It's scary and annoying? How long does this acute withdrawal thing last? How long to watch myself for seizures? Any support and help will be very welcomed :(",1

For about three and a half weeks a symptom went away replaced with something just as bad, fog, confusion de personalization ext.

Yesterday I had a window until yesterday night came around at nine. I was making conversation and actually felt safe,  felt good. Anyway almost had a panic attack and then the sensation in my brain came back and now it worse today than it was yesterday and is almost back to where it was before three and a half week ago.

I was suffering but relieved that my brain could heal. So I thought.

The thought was if this could go away then what I was dealing with currently could as well. Feel like I'm back where I was three and a half weeks ago.

Is this common for symptoms to come back or is this forever. Im tried of fighting.

Shit ehen I'm really determined and set my mind to it I can take 2.5 a day for a week straight. But eventually my body breaks down and I end up taking 6. 

I guess what I'm saying is I'm taking 3 to 3.5 a day on average. How can I get to 0 without taking any anti depression medication? I want to be free of all medication and Xanax is all I take. 

So if my baseline is 3.25 mg.. maybe take 3.0 every day for 2 weeks. 2.5 for 2 weeks.  2.0 for 2 weeks, 1.5, etc? I feel like in theory that sounds good but I always end up failing. Thoughts? Sorry for long post.",3

I’m 26 now. I started at 0.25mg as needed and slowly increased to 1mg as needed. Around 22 or 23 years old, I started taking 1mg on a nightly basis to sleep/for anxiety. A slippery slope.

I never felt that Xanax had any recreational value for me. I didn’t take it to “have fun,” I took it to calm down and get some sleep. I’ve always had a lot of trouble sleeping compared to the average person. 

Looking back at the last few years of my life where I started taking the drug without thinking much about it, I realize I was numbing myself. I wasn’t happy with a lot of things about myself and my life.

I broke up with the love of my life a year ago. I have remained in love and in contact with her and last month, she ended things. I realized I left her because I was numb and thought I didn’t “need” her, etc. 

I don’t want to be numb anymore.

A year and a half ago, I started going to a psychiatrist (Xanax was prescribed by my primary care doc). Around a year ago, I told them I wanted to taper my Xanax usage. They immediately cut me down to 0.5mg per day. It was wildly uncomfortable but my only real symptoms were anxiety/derealization, from what I remember.

Since quarantine started, I’ve been taking probably 0.75mg per day instead of my 0.5mg as prescribed.

I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to be here. I want to feel everything. I want my memory back. I never want to lose someone I love because I’m not really present.

Please help me taper off of this. I’m currently stabilizing on the 0.5mg instead of 0.75mg. It’s been very uncomfortable, especially in the mornings as I take it at night.

I know the Ashton method - I have all the tools to make a solution in 100ml of milk and dump 1ml per day.

Given my dosage and how long I’ve been on the medication, how long should my taper take? When do I push through and when do I stabilize?

I’m running 2 miles every morning and lifting weights after work. I also meditate 20 minutes per day and take melatonin to sleep. I have a healthy diet and drink a gallon of water per day.

Please help me. Please.

TL;DR: How long will it take me to taper off of 0.75mg Xanax after 8 years of use, 3 years of daily use at 1mg? Got down to 0.5mg one year ago, been back up to 0.75mg the last two months.",1

So when I was taken to the hospital(b/c I had a seizure while driving) the doctors put me back on clonazepam and took me off wellbutrin.

Weird experience,"TL;DR - Took <.5mg of Etizolam last night, it relieved about 80% of the symptoms I still have after two weeks. Woke up today, Etizolam and it’s metabolites have completely passed out of my system. But I still feel significantly better than I have for the last two weeks. Almost back to normal even. Is this like an actual thing? Are we supposed to take a microdose after we’ve stopped using for awhile to get our body back into gear and producing the right amount of chemicals?



Details - So I finally made it 2 weeks off of benzos last night, and I was still feeling some of the physical symptoms of anxiety (never really got the mental part too much for some reason) like that feeling in your chest we all get, restless legs, and some body soreness. 

So I decided eh fuck it, and I rinsed put a couple vials that previously contained a liquid solution of benzodiazepine along with licking the rubber part of the syringe (The solution kinda lubricates the syringe that way, it’s still a very small amount all together. Nothing over half a mg of etizolam was consumed, which is half as potent as Xanax if you don’t know much about it).

I also had a single beer over the course of maybe three-ish hours. Big no no for anyone recovering or currently on benzos btw, I only had it because the <1/2 mg of etizolam oddly enough relieved me from about 80% of my symptoms.

But anyways, I’ve been up for a few hours so far today and the Etizolam along with it’s metabolites have completely passed out of my system (rinsed the vials about 17 hours ago). But the weirdest thing is that I feel a LOT better today than I have at all so far. I dare say I feel almost normal haha. I was on “slightly” irresponsible doses of Etizolam for ~5 of the 7 months I was on it so the start of me stopping use was hell, but I just don’t get how one night of sleep has seemingly brought me ten times as far as I was.",3

I can’t take feeling like this anymore! When I’m on the Xanax I do not feel like this.

I feel like I’m missing something.,"I’ve been tapering off Ativan since January. I don’t know why, but I’m insanely sensitive to benzo rebound/withdrawal and because of that, I’ve been stuck at .25mg per day for over two months now. To make matters worse, I got to the point where even staying at .25mg was throwing me in and out of withdrawal every day because the half-life finally caught up with me. 

I asked my doctor to switch me to the equivalent dose in Valium (2.5mg), but now I keep reading that this transition needs to be done slowly and carefully. Why wouldn’t I be able to just switch directly if I’ve been given an equivalent dose? I guess I just don’t understand the reasoning behind it and I’m nervous about screwing It up.

I realize I’m at a low dose and probably sound like I’m overthinking this, but I’m really not exaggerating when I say I’m extremely sensitive to this stuff. I must have some sort of GABA related dysfunction, I tried 500mg of phenibut once about a year before I was prescribed benzos and just the rebound from that gave me insane anxiety, violent tremors from head to toe and a seizure. I’m a recovered alcoholic so that might have something to do with it. 

Anyway, if I could get some advice on how to switch over to Valium and taper off of that it would mean the world to me. I feel bad that I keep bugging this sub but you guys seem to know your stuff way more than my doctor does. He spent weeks refusing Valium because he thinks a shorter half-life is somehow better for a taper.",1

     I’m in my 2nd year in college, and keeping my secretive self destructive habits around drugs hasn’t gone well. My doctor increased the xanax prescription (90 pills, 1mg / month) and gave me a new adderall prescription (60 pills, 30mg XR / month). 
     Furthermore, I started a pretty aggressive cocaine and ketamine addiction. As you could assume, mixing  sedatives and stimulants has completely wrecked my mental and physical health. 
     Although I’m a girl in a sorority, I recently moved into a fraternity house (also terrible for my drug habits). I started tapering off xanax (for the 18393929 time) on June 1st. Unfortunately, I suffered a grand mal seizure in front of all my friends on Saturday (June 7th). They were really swift to drag me into the car where 3 brothers took me to the ER nearby thankfully. Funny enough, the hospital gave me ANOTHER prescription for Valium. 
     I’m back home now. Still feel hazy and embarrassed from that episode because i think it really scared them. I fear for my health now and in the long term. My parents aren’t very concerned because my grades are still exceptional.

Then I felt the symptoms of the title of this thread. For hours. I even woke up the next day with these symptoms on: my right hand and side in general dumber and it was hard to type on my phone.

Now, I know how wd can simulate a bunch of extreme and strange symptoms, but I am very worried about this ""right side losing sensibility"" thing as well as the fact that I had this after working/thinking too much on wd.

I did a CT can yesterday at an hospital, 12 hours after the episode, and nothing strange was found. But now I am worried that maybe it was a ministroke that left no signs with this raising the chances of a stroke. Again, the one side thing really worried me.

Any similar experience on these kind of symptoms?

Alright, about a month ago my psychiatrist prescribed me ativan 1mg for insomnia. I also have ADHD and started taking ritalin few months ago.
I already Googled everything i could learn about the drug and i was fully aware of the issues people have when taking benzos long term. But i didn't think that 1mg daily for a month would be a problem. I also did somewhat abuse it. I was cutting the pills in half so i could take one half before bed and one after waking up. At 28 May (9 days ago) i had the last pill and couldn't refill my script because of the corona situation here in iraq. I also didn't want to get addicted so i was like fuck it. The first day without ativan was pure hell. Terrifying. I was hallucinating basically. Overall the first week was hell. Insomnia got 10 times worse than before starting this shit. My heart rate is very high and i feel like something is stuck in my throat all the time. There is a big improvement from the first week, yesterday i slept for around 6 hours which is a miracle for me. However i started to think about refilling my script and taking it atleast for a few days a month just to get some sleep because this sleep deprivation is killing me slowly. Would it be better if started taking it again but only as needed basis?
Any tips to ease the insomnia?

Excuse my English.

I was stressed at work today but I was also obsessed about finishing something. I was noticing that I was about to enter ""overheat"" mode, something that I feel once in a while in my taper.

I continued working even tired and stressed, obsessed that I could only chill if the job was finished.

Then, I felt as if a lot of blood flowed to my head, became confused and my blood pressure raised for a few minutes.

After this, it was bad and it was not stopping: the right temple of my head was burning, my right arm was weak, I was confused and I was barely able to type on my celphone. My BP and heart rate were normal on this. Even with these normal measures was almost unbearable to be in my place... my head was a nonstop mess.

Then, 1 hour has passed and I was still feeling this intense heat on my right temple and my right side was weak. Hard to talk normally to my parents. I lost for a while a part of the sensibility of my right hand. Still problematic to type on the phone.

Now, 2 hours later my head is better but still burning in the right side. My right arm is stronger but still weak. And I am thinking that my little finger from the right hand has less sensitivity. 30 minutes before I decided to take my V dosage 4 hours before the usual scheduled hour.

I am afraid that the stress + wd symptoms might have created a scenario that caused a stroke or something like this.

Should I go to the hospital? Right now the sensibility of my hand is a bit better but my right temple still feels hot.

I know, I will stop pushing myself too much on my job. But what do you think I had? Is it still anxiety + wd related or did I go too far?

And always have a 10 day break before I get my next script because I’m terrified of withdrawals.

I usually try to never dose more than 2-3 days in a row and try to keep recreational use to a minimal and still only using pretty mild doses.

On around days 5-8 of my breaks I usually get some rebound anxiety (moderate to severe)
But usually I can storm through and deal with it.

Anyway that’s just some background but what  I really want to know is

What are withdrawals really like? Like at there worst?

I can never really find any definite answers usually just threads of people who have all experienced them talking about them but never really explaining what the actual experience is.

Are there hallucinations? Delusions? Nightmares? Pain?

Do you get sick? Does it effect your appetite?

I wanna know it all, for one I want reinforce as to why I should respect benzos, have breaks and not abuse my medicine and I’ve always been a bit of a drug nerd and can never find definite answers when I google it, just vague blanket answers and convos that only “insiders” would understand.

Also do different benzos have different withdrawals? How does half life impact withdrawal?

How long does it take for them to start? 

How long should a tolerance break last?

I know these are a lot of questions but I’m super curious and there aren’t any real solid posts that show up when you google “What are Benzo withdrawals really like?”

So I’m sure if a few people comment this thread will help at least some people.

I am taking a poll to see how many people had or continue to experience cravings using benzos. I have noticed that:

a. In my experience, even during withdrawal, drug craving is almost entirely absent and,
b. Benzos seem to have a much higher objective ""drug effect"" than they do subjectively.. Plainly, you will seem more inebriated to others than you will yourself, the person actually taking the drug. (this is one of the reasons why benzo dependence sneaks up on you)

2020-06-04 00:02:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/gw9thy/doc_trying_to_get_me_to_cold_turkey/,Doc trying to get me to cold turkey,"I've been using benzos every day essentially for the past 2 years or so. For the first 6 months or so it was pretty bad, like 2mg diclazepam, .5mg clonazolam, 2g phenibut every day. Tapered myself to around just 2mg diclazepam. 

I have a major problem with kratom as well, at my worst I was taking around 60-100gpd. Now its only around 15 id say (estimate, could be less/more) but can't shake it, the withdrawals are identical to heroin for me, i know its different for everyone but for me they're just unbearable. So early April I was put on an 8mg a day suboxone regimen, of which I only used 4mg, and the last week or so I used 2. 

However I definitely did not have enough time to taper effectively off of the subs, and wound up back using kratom. So my doctor wanted to start me back up suboxone, which i was hesitant about but ultimately decided it was healthier both mentally and physically to be stable for the entire day and not have interdose withdrawals 2 hours after a kratom dose/sleeping 4 hours a night and waking up in cold sweats etc.

When I was on the subs before I was still using diclazepam but had tapered to around only .5mg or so a day, I thinl bc the subs were masking some of the withdrawals symptoms, which honestly i thought was awesome, i definitely could've kept tapering them had i been on the subs longer and i think eventually stopped once I was around .2ishmg 

But now, she said she would only do the suboxone again if i stopped the benzos immediately cold turkey. To which I replied, I understand why because mixing downers etc whatever, but it wasnt a problem the first time, and I had even managed to significaly lower my diclazepam dosage while on it. I told her I want to but I just don't think its safe, being that I had used them for 2 years straight, I didn't think cold turkeying was a smart idea. 

She kept telling me seizures wouldn't be an issue and withdrawals would only last a week etc (acutes at least) and that she recommended just doing in patient rehab for a few days until I was over the acutes. I straight up just said I think you're wrong, and so does the internet, scientifically and anecdotally. I do not think it would be safe for me to just suddenly discontinue usage like that. Especially now that my dose has increased to around 1ish 1.5mg. 

I understand why she wouldn't want to do suboxone, but I think it was incredibly irresponsible for her to try to get me to just suddenly stop like that. She was very condescending in her tone as well with that look of ""im the doctor, i know more than you"" etc. But you can spend 5 minutes on the internet to see why stopping long term benzo usage suddenly is dangerous, even if you don't have a seizure it seems that it increases the duration of both acutes and post acutes, as well as the intensity. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest because she always makes me feel like shit for not being able to ""just stop"" and makes it seem like I'm blowing out of proportion how dangerous it could be",3

It was amazing at first, it made me so confident, I don’t have super bad anxiety but it’s enough to make me somewhat always uncomfortable in social situations. When I learned this drug took that away I was taking it like candy. I later now look back and realize what a dark place I was in at the time, I was using it as somewhat of an escape, it took away a lot of my memory and I was okay with that because I didn’t want to remember anything anyway. Well I got cut off cold turkey when I had to return to my parents home during the corona outbreak beginning, having no plugs I was cut off of every drug, weed xanax alcohol. Which I was using all of those things multiple times a week. Now, me not really realizing I had become dependent to this drug, I wasn’t worrying about withdrawals, in fact i didn’t even know benzos had withdrawals. 

Damn was I wrong, and I didn’t even realize that’s what all of this that happened to me came from until after I was back home to my apartment which was a week ago or so. It started with heavy anxiety and obsessive tendencies, I would freak out about everything. I mean everything, blood especially freaked me out. I’d spiral into these rabbit holes of thought for hours that scared the shit out of me. That lasted for about a week and then the panic attacks stepped in, now i’ve never experienced a panic attack before and now after having doing so i’d never like to have another one again. I had no idea what was happening to me I blamed it all on the insomnia, I was sleeping about 3 hours a day from 11am-2pm or so and I thought I was just driving myself insane. Well apparently now I know insomnia is just another withdrawal symptom of this god awful drug. Those were heavy, Id have to separate myself from everyone else the second I felt one coming on, my hands were always shaky and my breathing was staggered and I’d literally have to force myself to knock out in order to come back to reality.

There were times I was so out of it I really believed this was all some made up scenario in my brain as I was dying in the middle of my job or something like that, I’d randomly grab onto things to make sure they were real. But not even that convinced me. I mean this really does all seem unreal doesn’t it? The virus, the masks, the now rioting and god awful police brutality. It all feels so unreal. 

Well the mental affects slowly began to die down, and then the physical ones were right there to take their place. Out of no where, my bowel movements stopped, they stopped for 3 WEEKS. Every-time I ate something it hurt like hell, so i stopped eating, I was in the ER 3 times no one could tell me what was wrong with me and I had no idea it was withdrawals. It scared, the living, shit out of me. Literally. I was also extremely dehydrated, on top of not eating I was also barely drinking. They couldn’t even get my vein for an IV, they stuck me 5 times and blew 3 of my veins, one being in the dead middle of a CAT scan. They guessed gastroenteritis, so they put me on a jello-liquid-cracker diet for about a week, didn’t help. I went back to the ER screaming in pain because it felt like my stomach was about to literally rip open, they gave me morphine for pain and hooked me up to an IV ( which they had to use an ultrasound to finally get my vein this time ) and I sucked two bags down within 40 minutes or so. From there on out I was a new person, I finally had a fucking bowel movement and started to feel normal again. But eating still hurts me if I eat over 800-1000 calories or so a day, so I keep it light. No fried food no sweets. I eat a lot of raw fish, it helps for some reason. I gained 10lbs over those 3 weeks but since then have lost probably 20lbs, I haven’t checked, it’s been about 3 weeks now but I can see my body getting smaller and smaller. 

Now i’m not trying to scare anyone from stopping, so here’s where it does get better. I’ve felt so much more clear minded, for months I was basically a walking talking zombie. I went to work on xanax, I hung out with my friends on xanax, I did everything, on xanax. I would have 8 hour shifts and the second I get home barely remember what happened. My memory has definitely gotten way better, but my short term does seem somewhat worse in a way? Like I have a lot of times where I get up to get something or search something on Google and immediately forget what it was. Like a lot? But no more big black spots in my memory. So that’s good.

The withdrawals are hard, they really are, but I can feel my body healing. I’m way more attentive, I used to not be able to wake up before 3pm now I wake up at 10:30 everyday. I didn’t notice how disorganized and dirty my apartment was getting, I cleaned and went through the whole thing. The mental affects are very hard, but they will pass. For the physical ones, staying super hydrated and drinking a lot of water is the number one thing that helps me. I see a lot of people on here say they don’t enjoy coffee anymore because of the anxiety, so if that’s you obviously don’t go this route, but two cups of espresso everyday helps keep the god awful constipation down. Everyone is different and you have to go slow and see what foods work best for you, but you’ll eventually find a routine that keeps the withdrawal affects as minor as possible. It’s all worth it in the end, I know in the beginning it may feel like the pain will never end, but it will before you know it. Stay strong. We’re all in this together.",20

&#x200B;

Small background, haven't touched alcohol or phenibut since March, more than 3 months off the GABA stuff. Used to be dependent on benzo's, quit cold turkey, started semi-drinking after \~1 month which naturally gave me a lot of rebound anxiety without me knowing.. Enter phenibut, four times in 1 week and I was back to major withdrawals. Alas, we're +3 months further and I'm starting to feel better than ever.

&#x200B;

I got through my first month with Kratom (I had an internship I needed to do), it helped me a lot, but when I quit I felt extremely fatigued, with a slight anxiety rebound. I blamed it on a mild Kratom dependency.  Yet every time, in the past few months, when I took some caffeine, Kratom or a microdose LSD I've felt quite fatigued and flustered for 1-2 days. I'm starting to think it wasn't Kratom dependency, but my brain reacting to chemicals.

&#x200B;

I've come to accept the 100% sober life, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that I can't drink a simple coffee when I could really use it. (I could also really use some social drinking right now, but that can wait until my brain is healthy.)

&#x200B;

Is this normal? I've read you need to cut down on the caffeine because it can give you anxiety. But it gives me none, it just makes me fatigued and flustered, as if taking a few steps back in the recovery process. Pretty frustrating.",5

Hope you all are well. So I have been taking around 0.5-1.5 mg Ativan most nights mixed in with some Xanax here and there.

I’ve been on clonazepam for about two and a half months. On my third prescription bottle now. I want to get off of these but am afraid of the withdrawal. I’m taking .5 mg.

I started taking .25 today and have felt odd, what almost feels like heartburn. It makes me want to take a whole one just for it to stop.

I hope it’s just heartburn. But I would t be feeling withdrawals so soon would I? I’m planning on taking a whole one tonight, then continue taking half in the morning for a week, then the following week start taking just half for another week until I taper it down further.

It seems like good advice I was given in another thread I was given.

But how would I know if I really need this though? I can’t tell because I can’t pinpoint if it’s actually helped or not. I haven’t had panic attacks or super anxiety. It’s helped me somewhat but perhaps I was expecting something much more.

How do you know if clonazepam is really helping or not?",6

I don't ask my doctor for painkillers, but the second he asks if I'm anxious or having trouble sleeping I cant stop myself from saying yes. Then come the benzos. First I take one cuz Ive been freaking out, then more then more, then more. I don't want to do them, but if I tell my doctor I have a problem with them I wont get a script when I actually need it. I've been through the Ashton Manual protocols and had a very easy withdrawal a few years ago because of the writings. I thought I was done with it. It wasnt like heroin where it was on every street corner, or alcohol, which is even more available. I was free. After these years though Ive learned Im never free. This is worse than alcohol and heroin combined. Ive only been back on it a few days but I remember why I thought benzos were the devil.

Update: Ive been completely off for a couple of weeks now. It's liberating. Thank you to those of you who supported me. Even just saying something as simple as good luck and I hear you is super supportive. I didn't even read the responses when I wrote this cuz I was so nuerotic durin WD and stressed at the time.

using Xanax unprescribed for anxiety and ended up addicted for a good few months, taking anything from  5 -15mg a day. Managed to come off on my own with thankfully no seizures, just horrible withdrawal.
I relapsed a few times but I’ve been clean for over 6 months now.
I still have some Clonazepam left I havnt touched in months and tbh hated taking that recreationally as it didn’t give me any high just felt drowsy and unable to do anything during the day, so having it around hasn’t been tempting.

I’ve struggled with nightmares on and off recently so decided to take a 1mg Clonazepam last night. I slept really well - no dreams at all and feel totally normal this morning.

I’ve never struggled with insomnia even when withdrawing previous times from Xanax and Valium, and including on all sorts of other substances like stimulants. 

I currently don’t drink for other health reasons, take no other drugs/medication, can’t afford therapy. 

My question is, am I going down a dangerous path here even if I keep my usage to bed times only? People who’ve done this long term, what have the side effects been after weeks/months when used for sleep? (Besides insomnia).
