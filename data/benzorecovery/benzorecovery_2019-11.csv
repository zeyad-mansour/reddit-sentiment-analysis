Clonazepam and alcohol has made the last 8 years of my life a big ball of blur.  Even some of my very recent memories like my sons 2nd birthday feels like it happened ages ago.  I have been stuck in a dream world with seemingly no way out.  

I was aware that benzos did fuck with our memory but not to this extent.  It's amazing that I can recall entire days now. I'm assuming this is only the beginning.  Feels like I have been given a new life, one that i can actually live and remember this time

I can hardly believe the perspective change. And how far I have come. Life is Great. Better than it has been in 15 years. I use to look at people and wonder what that was like. To just be a person. Like with a life not frought with undue anxiety and dependance on a substance, whose risk of stopping was a fate I once considered worse than death. Holy, shit. Im glad I was stubborn. Hold on, you can make it! I have a life now. A beautiful, amazingly sweet girlfriend, I'm my own boss and have plans for opening my own cabinet shop. Life is so much better. In a place I once imagined might just be a mean trick to play on people like me. It's Not! I swear!

 There are always a lot of posts about people struggling and wondering if it is possible or if it will ever end. I was one of those people, and I now know it is possible. Some background. I was taking high doses of Valium for about 2 years, in addition to kratom. Before that I had been an opiate addict and often abused xanax for and additional 7 years. I was using the benzo for anxiety relief but I was overusing them and was Rx'd an insane amount. I quit the kratom, and was still stuck with a benzo dependence/addiction (I'm not the type to really distinguish between the 2 things, one is just a word for medically prescribed addiction). 22 days after quitting the kratom I checked into an IOP (intensive outpatient program). It consisted of Dr. appointments as needed, at least 3 3hr groups a week, and therapy, and meds. I was given klonopin to taper with at whatever pace I felt comfortable. I was taking 120+- mg of Valium or 6mg Klonopin equivalent when I went in. I started that day with a 50% cut to 3mg. Over the next\~ 9 weeks I tapered down and stopped on June 7 2019. I was uncomfortable the entire time. It was not easy. I was given 1200mg/day of gabapentin to help with tapering, and it did help. I didn't take the full 1200mg until the last 2 weeks, and then for \~30days after completely stopping. I took 600-900mg/day for the first 7 weeks. Also clonidine, usually just one 0.1mg at night for help with sleep, but up to 0.3/day. I was worried that the gabapentin was replacing benzo addiction and going to be just as hard to stop. I took my last gabapentin this past Saturday. The first 2 days were kinda rough, but nothing in comparison to benzo withdrawals. I noticed the gabapentin was making me a bit of a space cadet and I couldn't distinguish if it was the gabapentin or residual benzo wd until I stopped the gabapentin and it was the gabapentin. I feel back to my old self. I'm completely sober and off all meds after a 9year run with addiction to opiates and benzos and whatever else I self medicated with. I didn't think it was possible. I didn't think I could function without substances. I can! And I now have the opportunity to do life the right way. I will say that I still get anxious, but it's less intense than it was when I was on drugs, and it's important to acknowledge that anxiety is a state that most people experience. Groups and exposure therapy, like throwing myself in uncomfortable situation where I often ended up making an ass of myself actually really helped, over time you get better at handling yourself. I'm a very introverted person. I hope some of you find this encouraging and can get to a stable point without benzos. I am now 41-42days off benzos and don't have protracted wd symptoms. Things keep getting better. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. My first benzo wd back in 2013 scared me so bad I didn't ever want to do it ever again and I'd have rather done heroin wd 100x over.

Wow, some really smart people here. I can't change the past but I can try to improve my future. 30 days clean of a huge alcohol problem, now have the valium to taper from. Alcohol issue was for 15 years, Xanax -  5 now on about 20 mg of valium a day last 2 years, tapered to 10 at one point. 

Please don't drink and xanax, most benzos - terrible, can kill you easily and will destroy your life. No idea why I continued but I did. Xanax and booze were particularly horrific in regard to blacking out and doing the most awful things.

I went to the doctor today and we made a withdrawal schedule for me, starting from today. I am supposed to take Oxazpam, 10mg tablets each day for a week ( I can take half each time if I want ). Then half a table for a week after that. Then it's done.

But I just took a quarter of a tablet 5 hours ago and feel pretty good. Do I really need to take the next dose? 
My feeling is that I should just take it if I feel some need for it or am feeling crappy, but without exceeding the daily dose. I just talked to my brother and my mother and they feel this way also.

I have been using Oxazepam for over half a year. For the last 3 months I have been using it around 4-5 times a week in the evenings, 5mg. That is half a tablet of the lowest doze. 

A few days ago I started taking extended release tablets (Alprazolam Krka, 0.5mg (Xanax is the active ingredient)). First 2 days I took one tablet each day, next 2 days I took 2 tablets each day. Then I decided to stop but felt so horrible that I took one tablet. This was yesterday. Today I started my withdrawal schedule.

It was only after reading about some folks that were talking about withdrawals from it that I thought I may have them.  I've never been on anything else, only short periods like anti-biotics, or after surgeries, with a few pain pills.  Never got hooked luckily.

I stopped cold-turkey in about 2009 or '10 and thought I was losing my marble. I won't go into the withdrawals as most of you will already know.  After a week of hellish wd's, I went into my doctor and asked him if I could keep taking them as I felt I really did need them after all.  I know I sound stupid but only because I was, about this situation.

Now, about 3 years ago I decided I wanted off them completely and wanted to do it right.  So I talked to my doc and started weaning down, 1/4 at a time.  Got to .5 and got lazy, or scared.  Like maybe I did need them for my mood swings, anxiety, panic.  My doc put on the script I could take 2 a day if needed when I told her.  

I am so sick of having to take these, and go to the doctor after I have 2 refills taken of .5, and today was the last straw. I don't always get the due date on the bottle right because there are 3 dates, I get confused.  So I called the pharmacist and they had the script ready for pick up 2 days ago. But I just got down there today.  Well the pharmacist then told me I had to wait til the 30th.  It was because they give me 30 or the .5 so I told her that I was allowed to take 2 and did so for about 5 times.

Anyway, now I don't have any until the 30th, and yes I'm scared of withdrawal but am wondering if I could go without, from now on, since I get by of .5mg about 25 days of the months?  Anyone do this, quit cold turkey after .5 mg a day?  If so, was it pretty bad or no?  I know everyone is different, and I suppose just ""having"" to go without til Saturday should give me my answer.

However I have to say that sometimes I tried to calm down by going out and having a few drinks because I didn't want to rely on my Xanax. However that didn't work so at the end I needed to take my prescribed dose.

I never really thought I was abusing it because I used it as prescribed and barely took it and when I did I would take under the prescribed dose of .5mg. Although it did worry me about the alcohol use I pretty much kept it under control and typically didn't drink if I took the Xanax except on a few occasions where I couldn't calm down.

Anyways, with that in mind...it took me about 3 months to go through my .5mg once a day script of Xanax. Never got a refill or anything. During those three months however my anxiety skyrocketed and I was like ok time to make some changes. I stopped drinking, stopped taking caffeine and slowly weened off my stimulant medication. I felt ok, but then I stopped my Xanax as well for about a week and I was fine at times but other times I would start to develop panic attacks.

I told my doctor this and she prescribed me Valium to take 10mg twice a day. I thought, ok well my anxiety is really bad and I should try to trust what the doctor says so I tried it. After about a week of taking the 10mg twice a day as prescribed I stopped taking it because it made me feel really slow and sedated.

So for the past **two months**, I stopped drinking completely, stopped caffeine, and stopped my stimulant medication. Stopping the Valium though is becoming really difficult and I am not sure what to do since I didn't take it every day. For the past month, i've managed to take it pretty much on average 5mg every 5 days. However my anxiety, intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, and also muscles twitches are still pretty bad.

I have a few questions. Do you think that my past alcohol use is interfering with my current situation despite it being about 2 months since stopping? What is the risk of seizures at this point in time? Should I tough it out or go on the Ashton Protocol? How would I implement the Ashton Protocol even though I didn't take them every day. The following is a list of the date and dose that I've taken my medication for the past month:

Valium

10/25 - 5mg

10/28 - 10mg

10/31 - 5mg

11/4 - 5mg

11/6 - 5mg

11/14 - 5mg

11/18 - 10mg

11/25 - 5mg

Right now my main concern is the risk of seizure. Some of my symptoms right now are really scary intrusive images, sort of going in and out of my head, derealization, anxiety panic, headache and muscle twitches. The most distrurbing is the sort of out of it feeling and intrusive thoughts. Like especially when I close my eyes, I get really bad intrusive images and they're just random images they aren't even that scary but they literally just pop in my head and its really scary. I don't know what to do. Sometimes the thoughts or images are so real I don't know if what in front of me is actually real. Idk what to do.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.461139}"

Everyday. Until 8 days ago...I decided for a taper. 1st week done. Today (November 23rd) was the first day of my taper drop. Went to 7.7mg. Took three 2.2 pressed pills and split one in half. Close enough to 7.7mg. I plan on doing this for the the next week or 2 depending on how I'm feeling. But so far I'm feeling good. Great actually. I dose every morning around 9am. Im good the whole day. And even when I wake up the next morning...I feel fine. I can wake up, have my coffee, take my shower and walk my dog, THEN dose when I feel like it. But typically its 9am. So anyway once the week or 2 of 7.7mg is over...I'll be doing 6.6mg, 5.5mg, 4.4mg ect. All the way until I got down to .5mg. Keep it there for a month or so is the bbn plan. Again, all depending how I feel at each step. I dont care if this take 6 months. It's getting done. I'm 28, was just married in May. And have a baby boy due in February. I bought some supplements that are supposed to be amazing with benzo tapering/WD. 

-Black Seed Oil (1.5g a day)
-Niacin (unsure of the daily doseage)
-Vitamin C (1,000mg a day)
-Ultra strength fish oil (2,000mg a day. Omega 3,6,9 complex)
-Magnesium Glycinate (400mg a day)
Atleast this is the plan.


And I have tons of 1ml/50mg CBD tincture on hand with a few kilos of kratom. I'm really very adamant about this etizolam. Etizolam worked awesome when I first started it, (right after my father and brother in law passed [cancer] and the wife and I lost everything in the CampFire that took place in Paradise, CA). 1-1.5mg for social events and just daily life. It was awesome. I felt so....comfortable in my own skin. I want that back. But not daily...only when needed. Social gatherings, holidays, visiting the in-laws (lol). That's one thing I'm changing this time. At the most....once a week. Looking at my son everyday will be my motivation. 

This was/is my first run in with a benzo(analogue) and I really wish I would have listened to people when they said  benzos were a slippery slope. I did the same thing with kratom when I was first introduced to it. 16g a day in the first month. Now I'm down to 6g once a day for my pain and anxiety. And have found to quit kratom much easier than Etizolam.

I think I started tapering three days ago... taking 3/4 of the 0.25 mg. I'm chronically ill anyway so I may not even notice if I'm withdrawing since I always feel like crap. Only things I've noticed so far... sometimes my legs feel weird, like how they felt when I was on antipsychotics. Today, my ears have been ringing, which they tend to do if I haven't taken a med or am withdrawing from a med. Slightly increased anxiety. Maybe slightly increased heart rate - a little concerning because, while the clonazepam no longer seems to help my anger or anxiety, it seems to be continuing to help my Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (so I may talk to my cardiologist and ask if maybe I SHOULD be staying on it just for that - Idk).

I'm also mentally unstable so hopefully I don't go nuts from this. I'll be seeing a new psychiatrist soon. After my taper I DO want to take benzos *as needed* if that'll even be a possibility, hopefully she'll be open to that idea. I've tried everything there is for anxiety so I'm kinda screwed. Even if I can't have something that controls my anxiety every day, even something that decreases the amount of anxiety episodes I have is important, I think.

I've been having a horrible time getting off these benzos and just can't really take it anymore. The doctor that originally prescribed the medication dropped me because of the severity of my anxiety and because I don't follow directions. For further clarification, I don't follow directions in the sense that I will start a medication, then stop it, then start it again or not take it. Although this dose happen its because either when I get on medication it is way too difficult to continue taking then when I try to stop I experience horrible withdrawal symptoms so i'm forced to take it.

Anyways, so now I am in a situation where my anxiety is horrible and I am worried about having really bad seizures or something worse while stopping my Valium.

To start, I was prescribed Xanax .5 mg to take once a day as needed for panic attacks. I did just that, most times taking .25-.5 probably 1 or 2 times a week when I had a panic attack. I thought that everything was fine because I wouldn't take it for a week and be fine. The doctor gave me a one month prescription and it lasted me about 3 and 1/2 months.

After a few months of that however, I noticed that in hindsight my anxiety was getting much much much worse. So I gave a call back and she prescribed me Valium 10mg two times a day. She said to take it every day as my anxiety was so bad. So I did that for a week and half but couldn't continue because it made me too foggy and slow which is difficult considering I am a student.

I did as she said and stopped and what would you know, I had horrible withdrawal symptoms, consistently going to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack or brain tumor or whatever...basically small things that were obviously just high anxiety. So I thought that I should probably just slow down and take it only as needed and try to go as long as I can without it then eventually stop. I thought I would do this the right time this go around and wrote done my dosage for the past month which is as follows:

10/25 - 5mg

10/28 - 10mg

10/31 - 5mg

11/4 - 5mg

11/6 - 5mg

11/14 - 5mg

11/18 - 10mg

It is currently 11/22 and I having some pretty bad anxiety but i'm not going to lie that this was the original reason it was prescribed although I would like to say that it is 100x worse. So I really just want to stop with the Valium completely and hopefully find alternatives to relieve my panic.

My question is, and I understand no one here is a professional or a doctor or anything of that sort, but if I just stop now do you think in your opinion that I would experience more of the very extreme withdrawal symptoms primarily **seizures**?

&#x200B;

As of right now, i've been having some derealization, anxiety, panic problems, and palpitations. However I tend to have these symptoms but just not to this extreme. Again, I don't mind stopping completely but does this seem like a situation where I should be worried about seizures?

I’ve seemingly developed numerous phobias and obsessions during the withdrawal and I have even seemingly developed a bit of psychosis due to lack of sleep. I’m constantly questioning reality because don’t feel like I’m even in it, I just feel like I’m a blob floating around, everything is a daze, most of the time I have no idea what day of the week it is or what time it is. Every second I feel like I’m going to have a never ending panic attack to my death. I’m constantly in extreme fear because it literally seems like I won’t make it through this. My mind is constantly thinking about death  and how I’m going to escape it and then it goes around in circles only to end up at the same place, there’s no escape it seems and I’m losing hope. The only thing pushing me through this is reminding myself that they are just withdrawal symptoms and they’ll pass with time, but there’s a part of me that feels like this may be more then just withdrawals. It’s as if I know what is right, what is logical and how messed up my brain is, but no matter what I’m stuck with it. It’s not a nice place to be. I’m just looking for some reassurance that these are withdrawal symptoms? And any advice for sleep? I think I can gain at least half of my sanity back if I can get some sleep. It seems as if I’ve developed a phobia around sleep as well because I’m worried I’ll wake up in full blown psychosis. It feels like any moment I can have a break and I’m holding on for life but internally freaking out.  My resting pulse is usually low 60’s but it’s been in the mid 80’s for the past week. Any advice or support is greatly appreciated. Also can I get confirmation on some of these symptoms? I’m really hoping it’s just sleep deprivation and withdrawal that is causing this. I also seem to be pondering a lot about how strange reality and life is, how we live on this planet in this massive universe and so on... it’s goes on and on, haha. They’re not kidding when they say gaba is a inhibitory neurotransmitter, no thought is inhibited anymore. Every noise, statement, thought feels like a stab directly into the emotional center of my brain and even though I try to reason through how irrational these fears are, they can’t seems to be reasoned through. Theres a monkey in my brain wreaking havoc and it can’t be submitted by the brains owner so it seems. My reasoning center has been overridden by emotions. Sometimes I feel like a shock to the brain will literally heal me, it’s as if something is stuck in my brain and it needs a real wake up call.

I started taking benzos (clonazepam) when I was 18 (am almost 23 now). I tried it for fun because my grandma had left a case with nearly 20 2mg pills in it.
I loved how chill I felt when taking them, the happiness and how awesome food and cigarettes tasted in my mouth.

Suddenly I was taking 4mg a day during university classes and started to blackout in the middle of them. Woke up with a bunch of school doctors who took me to the neurologist. My parents genuinely thought I had something wrong in my brain, I couldn't tell them the truth.
I upped my dose to 8mg a day and couldn't stay awake for long, dropped out of college and work, moved with my dad who also had depression and cocaine addiction. We were on it all day.
He started to get better, so I also tried to stop. Didn't take for six months then went on vacation with some friends and figured why shouldn't I get some pills to take with me just for fun?

Two days into the holidays, I was so drugged I couldn't understand what happened around me everyone knew something was up. It got so bad I slept for nearly 24 hours and when I woke up, I was so incredibly sad I wanted to die right there. My boyfriend sat with me on the bed with tears in his eyes and told me he received a phone call. My dad had committed suicide alone at home. I went on pilot mode and took nearly 30g and blacked out for two days. 

I got back home, we had the funeral. I couldn't stop thinking about the last time I had seen him, so stoned I couldn't even remember it properly. 

My family and boyfriend took away all my pills and I went through a rough withdrawal. 
Eight months later I found my aunt's stash and took 10mg. That day I missed my dad so badly I threw myself in front of a train to end it all. 

What I didn't expect was to survive with lots of broken bones and a consequent disability (I walk with a cane now). My last year was spent in the hospital, then a wheelchair and now I can finally say I'm at peace with what happened. 
I took 2mg clonazepam last month and hated every damn second of it. But I took again. Microdoses once every two weeks. I won't ruin my life again, but sometimes I'm afraid I won't be able to stop. 

I sincerely hope every last one of us move on. It's hard as fuck out there, but I know we can get through this. There are so many beautiful things in life to enjoy sober.

I'm (genuinely) writing this on behalf of someone else, who I am trying to help with their Xanax addiction. They didn't take it for very long (or even in large or regular quantities), but the addiction element is pretty severe. It's been 11 months since their last dose and they think about it every single day, with cravings becoming worse and worse with time. All of their motivation for being clean comes from external sources and none of it is internal. They are well aware of this, we've talked about it, and neither of us is sure how to switch this narrative from being externally to internally motivated.

They tried NA meetings for a few weeks without success (this may have worsened the situation) and I'm wondering if anyone has advice on a) how to reduce cravings, b) how to switch an abstinence mentality to being internally driven, c) how long it took for other people to stop craving (almost a year seems like a really long time to me to have things just ramp up constantly), and d) what support groups/programs/treatments helped you kick this habit and actually stay clean.

So I started taking lorazepam back in 2011 to help sleep at night, or get to sleep. From that point on I was taking usually .5 to 1mg per night. Over past 6-12 months I went down to .5 and then recently down to .25ish per night.

I decided after going down to .25 that I wanted to try and stop. I probably should have done some further research but figured it was low dosage.

So I'm 9 days off and don't think I'm having terrible withdrawal symptoms. The one thing is my sleep feels worse, as I'm waking up between 4-6 hours after going to bed and then can't really get back into deep sleep.

Recently I had some major life changes, buying a house, getting a new puppy starting a new job (performance driven). The stress from all 3 and having a very high-strung partner has made my anxiety sky rocket. That factored in with limited sleep (the puppy does not sleep past 3 AM unfortunately) has me on the verge of losing my mind. 

Current medications – Adderall and Ambien
The Ambien has been prescribed for over 6 years. I know this should have only been a short-term solution but for whatever reason my doctor forgot, and I haven’t complained to him as I now can’t sleep without it. I have definitely noticed a huge change in my cognitive abilities and constantly feel like my brain actually doesn’t work. I’m at the point where I’m so absent minded that I’m terrified I would accidentally space out and the dog would wander in the street and get hit by car. (These types of thoughts are constantly on repeat in my head). I will be discussing with my doctor about a taper off the Ambien. 

Right now, I’m averaging about .25 mg xans every 3 days. I’ll go for 1 to 2 weeks without taking anything and then the stress and anxiety will become to unbearable to where I break down and start taking daily (.25 or less for 1-2 days). I used to take 1-2 bars a day unprescribed for last 7 years up until 4-5 months ago. I’m beginning to wonder however if the Ambien is a bigger problem than the actual Xan’s. It really feels like I’m in withdrawal everyday as I have this horrible shitty anxiety feeling and anything stressful sends me into a straight panic. Even very basic things that most people wouldn’t bat an eye over. I don’t remember ever being this way. 

I exercise 3-4 days a week, usually doing CrossFit or running. I intermittent fast, take multi-vitamins, Calcium, Vitamin-D, Flaxseed Oil, and usually take 1-2 tsps a day of Kratom to help with anxiety. I also eat pretty healthy and don’t drink much during the week. I’m also re-reading the Ashton Method but don’t have access to Val’s.

But now I feel my body strongly craving it several hours after my last dose. It’s almost like the Klonopin has lost someone of its potency and has a shorter duration. I can’t even sleep through the night without waking up with a fast heart beat anxiously craving it. 

I purposely made sure that they didn’t give me any morphine or anything with oxycodone at the hospital. They gave me toradol intravenously, and all I’ve been taking for pain is Motrin and Tylenol. They did give me 2mgs of a very short and fast acting benzo (forget which one) to knock me out before surgery, but this was  8 days ago already. To compensate for that, I only took 0.5mgs of Klonopin that evening  instead of the normal 0.75mg. Not much of a compensation, but the best I could do after an operation, as the fast acting benzo was long out of my system. Didn’t wanna take any chances. 

I guess I should also note that I had tapered down from 2mgs to 1.75mgs about 5 weeks ago.  However, I was fully adjusted to that dose as I only had Ill effects from the taper for about 4-6 days after my dose reduction. Meaning that I was free from any withdrawal for roughly a month before surgery. 

Does anyone know why this is happening? Will it get better? Please help. I’m quite nervous about this.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5129158}"

started using etizolam on and off about a year ago, I've now been using daily (usually a minimum of 2mg, 3 times daily. though sometimes can go up to 10mg in a day. so probably around 7-8mg daily average) for around nine months. have tried to stop a couple times unsuccessfully, took a couple days out a few months ago and I felt intense headaches, paralysing anxiety, and mental anguish like I have not experienced before - though no seizures or DTs.

 I don't want to be using but am finding it hard to reduce my usage alone, so have sought the advice of a doctor and drug service. after waiting to see a drug specialist, I attended an appointment today and explained my situation. he has asked that when my next delivery of etizolam arrives, I bring everything in my possession to him immediately. then he said he will prescribe be 20mg a day of diazepam, and we will reduce 1mg a week for 20 weeks. this gradual reduction sounds good but I am worried that the initial drop from 7mg etizolam a day (equivalent to 70mg diazepam according to everywhere I've looked) to 20mg diazepam sounds quite extreme.   


does anyone here agree? I know he's a doctor and I'm an addict and he has my best interests at heart, he was very reassuring and seemed like he knows what he's talking about. but I'm worried that a 60+% reduction might be too swift and too severe to start off with, I know the Ashton manual recommends that you reduce by 10% from the starting dose. 

I worry that he doesn't understand the potency of etizolam and that this initial drop could give me some serious WD symptoms. when I've run out of etiz before and been taking a couple diazepam a day to get by until my delivery arrived, it was barely even doing anything, and I'm concerned that I'll immediately go into that state. also switching from one type of Benzo to another is an added concern, as I know etiz and Diaz work on slightly different receptors.

Should i make myself a bit comfy temporarily upping a dose to feel better for a week before i start tapering? Or try and cut first drop (2.5mg valium as 10%) and wait till i stabilise and feel normal-ish again? I ve got so much do, work, study, must remain semi functional.

I dont know if i can handle feeling even more shit that i feel now for a week or two. I cant tell my doc because he cuts me out in 3-4 weeks and i will lose my job and career. He will be against slow taper. He gives me some shit that completely shut my memory. Slow and steady taper is the way to go, can be done without too much trouble but i need few days to feel like human before i proceed.

So, I have a terrible problem with alcohol and have developed severe kindling due to repeated bouts of withdrawal—to the point where one night of binging will send me into it again.

I have detoxed successfully using prescribed diazepam more times than I can count on two hands.

I recently relapsed and went to the walk-in clinic and was shocked as the Dr. proceeded to prescribe me thirty 5mg diazepam almost before the request could leave my lips (they will usually refer me to the ER or a detox center).

As withdrawl anxiety will do, I was worried on day three of the valium taper that I wouldn't have enough pills to get back to baseline for an important upcoming school week. So I went back to the same doc and was all-the-more dumbfounded when he whipped out his pen to write me a script for *fourty-five* more diazepam without batting an eye.

As an addict will do, I took more than I usually would (particularly at bedtime 'cause *ooooh that sweet slumber that is so hard to find in the throes of withdrawal*) because, well, I had more than I usually would (I'm typically given anywhere between ten and thirty 5mg pills). I never exceeded 30mg in a 24 hour period, though, and after day five I began halving them and slowly decreasing my dosage—except at bedtime.

This Dr. gave me no dosage regime apart from *take 15mg 3 times daily by mouth* and, while I have home-detoxed with valium close to two-dozen times, I always just take less and less each day and stop by day seven. It's always worked for me.

This time, though, as of day six I still felt dysfunctional without 10mg interspersed throughout the day, so I continued to take them while lowering my dosage each day or two.

It is now day twelve and I took half a pill (2.5mg) earlier today, and am currently attempting to sleep with none as I want to be done with the things. I slept alright last night on 2.5mg but still woke up with residual anxiety in the morning.

This has been an abnormally long taper for me compared to my typical seven days and I am concerned that it will take a while to bounce back from. I'm not well-versed in benzos outside of their efficacy in mitigating booze withdrawal, and I am hoping someone can tell me if twelve days of valium while decreasing dosage is something i should be at all nervous about. I have two days to feel better before another important week and the residual anxiety is concerning me.

I apologize for rambling but I tend to do that when I'm anxious, and sleep isn't coming easily yet...

**TLDR** I have used diazepam to detox from alcohol close to two dozen times but am always finished taking it by day seven. This time, I was overprescribed and took more than I have historically, resulting in a twelve-day valium taper. Is that long enough to be concerned about or am I just being paranoid?

Having experienced booze withdrawal countless times and having heard that benzo withdrawal is purportedly *another level of hell entirely*, I cannot even imagine, and I'm terrified of possibly developing even the slightest dependency on them.

Again, I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask but I just want to be sure that a twelve-day valium taper is not long enough to cause harm.  I know I'm not in any serious trouble but I'd like to know if I'm going to feel wonky for any significant amount of time.

I can take withdrawal pretty well and have detoxed over 10 times before, but every time I pick it back up it always gets worse, everybody is different. I hate these things but I keep coming back for more because I know a guy. I will always know a guy no matter how professional or normal I look. Any advice? Say a prayer for me, id appreciate that. I don't want to go back.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7390127}"

If I've learned anything in the 20 years I've had these damn pills it's that they fuck you up, and over, and yes it's hard to escape them. 

But idk if there is a real answer to anxiety relief right now without one. If anything they are over prescribed and dosage is crazy. Taking one or more a day for purely anxiety is crazy. For severe mental disorders/diseases they still have a lot of use. 

I think I've tried just about every supplement I can. From chamomile to cbd. Gaba to valerian..Sam e 5htp and more.. there's been moments I got by with those, but financially it's suicide. I'd spend 200 bucks a month easy to make my days tolerable. Never truly feeling good/calm and anxiety free. I've gotten back to where just .5 of a mg will help most of my anxiety attacks.. but that's only taking one 2-3 times a month if that. The pills still scare me, but honestly I don't know what I'd do without one for the moments everything gets too overwhelming. 

I'm not really defending benzos, but for those who think can't go a day without one, it's ok. Taper down, hold on to them, and know they're there for an emergency, but I'd say everyone should treat these pills like they're sitting next to a deadly predator. Treat every move with caution..",33,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7233731}"

Cannabis without tolerance causes anxiety but if you are used to CBD/THC weed always seems to help in any kind of matter.

Kratom is usually always anxiolytic and relaxes body and mind but since it's a natural opioid it can be addictive too if used too often (the withdrawal is a joke compared to benzos though).",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4822129}"
2019-11-02 02:48:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/dqgpix/ready_to_start_the_taper/,Ready to start the taper.,I was prescribed .5 Xanax a day about a year and a half ago for panic attacks. I have taken my for everyday (not a smart move in hindsight) but have never gone over the .5. My panic attacks come less so I’m ready to get off this train. I’m tired of this and am finding the fear of Xanax rebound anxiety is worse then my normal anxiety. I know there’s a lot of variables but how bad is this going to suck?,3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.91363734}"
2019-11-01 22:30:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/dqedtl/are_gabaergics_that_work_on_gabab_receptor_not_a/,"Are gaba-ergics that work on gaba-b receptor not A obviously we a good or bad idea for helping with withdrawals during taper...such as baclofen, or phenibut?","Mentally I’m doing fine but physically these WD’s are making me miserable my muscles are like Fkn rocks with the amount of trigger points and my neck is so damn stiff I can’t turn my freakin head side to side. Also dizzy as hell. Nauseated, ears are ringing loudly among many other things.’I need some relief.’I’ve tried herbs like l theanine, kava, valerian, Passion flower ashwaganda and on and on and gotten nothing out of them. Baths don’t rly work for muscles. I just got prescribed gabapentin which is maybe working a bit but not rly that much. Kratom doesn’t work I have too much tolerance.

So my question is since Baclofen and phenibut work on gaba b they wouldn’t interfere with the taper right like they wouldn’t be constantly resetting my taper and withdrawals because they don’t work on gaba a they work on gaba b correct? And there isn’t cross tolerance correct?
Also I am aware how addictive phenibut is I’ve used it before I would only use it 2-3 times a week and be very careful so please don’t say not to do phenibut for that reason the reason I wouldn’t do it is it it could possibly interfere with the taper.
