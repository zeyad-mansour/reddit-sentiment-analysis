So I am using the guidelines from the ashton manual, which says that 2 mg of xanax is equivalent to 40 mg of Valium.  I was on 15 mg of restoril for about 2 years. 15 mg of restoril is supposed to be equal to 7.5 mg of Valium.

So I cut the bar at the indentations, which gives me 4 each of .5 mg pieces.  I tried .5 mg, but it was a bit strong, so I went back and cut all into .25 mg pieces. I started taking .25 mg  3 times per day. That seemed to work out well and was equivalent to 15 mg of Valium.

I stayed on that schedule for 2 weeks, then reduced to roughly half, or .125 mg of xanax. That should be equal to 2.5 mg of Valium, 3 times a day. A total of 7.5 mg per day of Valium equivalency.

This feels good, and I plan on finishing by dropping .125 mg of xanax per week.  Hopefully I will be done in 3-6 weeks if my math is right.

I hope I didn't confuse anyone too much. I am doing it this way because I have no way to get valium, other than trying to buy it on the street.  Hopefully this will help you out if you also have no options.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.560962}"

How should I go about this?,"Backstory: long time addict here. Rehab. Sober living. The works. I’ve been on addy and benzos my whole life and I always abused them(at least the bezos) I only took the addy for work.

Finally about 7 months ago I became completely pill and alcohol free. 

I started a new job that pays a lot and I’ve been struggling to focus so I got some Ritalin off the dark web and it really helped. Then I noticed the same vendor sold bars and knpins and tramadol. I bought about 100 of each thinking I got myself under control now (yeah fucking right). 

Today is exactly one month of me taking benzos to get high. Probably up to 6-8mg a day. I can already feel myself being depressed without it. I want to stop before it’s too late. If I remember correctly, bars are the worst so my plan is to give those away to a friend immediately and use the k-pins to ween off. I haven’t touched the tramadol yet but I figured that would be good for the aches and pains of withdrawal. 

Is this a good plan or would you do something different? Thanks in advance!

EDIT: forgot to mention I still haven’t touched a drink in 7 months. If that matters. When I was off benzos I would use Kratom at the end of the day for relief from the addy.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50311524}"

1. Go down .25 a month so I’d be off in three months if I could handle the big cuts since I’d be giving myself a decent amount of time to acclimate 

2. Go down .125 (can break my 1 mg in 1/8s or get the .125 prescribed) every 2 weeks.

I realized something is preventing me from being happy. I could not find happiness from the small things and had to rely on external things. I realized it must be benzo that is preventing me. It was.

I decided to quit it, together with other shit like cigarettes and even social drinking. I tapered in one month and started to meditate and exercise. Also forced myself to meet people as much as possible, which turned out to be a smart move.

25 days later completely clean, and I am as good as restored. I feel it's like a new kind of life in me. It's like I am connected to a force of happiness and I can be happy for almost anything. I laugh a lot (almost never laughed before) and I find happiness in other peoples success. I find it pleasureble to hang out with people and people seem to like me so much more now than before.

I am much more creative, motivated and inspired. Almost no anxiety and I am really, really clear minded. Not depressed at all and I find joy in the small things, like the sun in the morning and the smell of flowers.

Hospital put me on a Librium taper for 4 days.,"Had a horrible tonic clonic seizure a few days ago that lasted over 3 minutes. Screwed up my back really bad, almost bit a hole in my tongue, and every muscle in my body, even in places I didn't know could have muscle pain were hurting for days. Today I'm finally starting to feel healed, thanks in part to going to a chiropractor a couple days ago and getting my back forced back into place.

Anyway, I was drinking quite a lot of alcohol every night for like 2 weeks and using a pretty good amount of Clonazolam (a research chemical benzo that's quite powerful, and is active in the *microgram* range) during the day. I was using like .5mg some days and an entire 1mg some days. I was actually trying to quit the alcohol and taper the Clonazolam when I had the seizure. Clonazolam is a super powerful benzo and I was stupid for using it. It was for the legality...

Anyway, I had to go to the hospital to get a CAT scan (I think that's what it was) and they put me on Librium, a benzo that has a metabolite that has a half life of up to like 200 hours.

I'm already getting brain zaps and this is my last day on it. First day was 4 doses of 25mg, second day was 3 doses of that, third was 2, and finally tonight is my last dose.

Is this long enough of a taper? Am I at risk of another seizure? I don't think my body can handle another one of those. I was having severe memory issues for a day or two afterwards. It really did a number on my body and psyche.

How screwed am I? Do you think the Librium will be enough? I'm not planning on abusing benzos or alcohol ever again, that's how bad the seizure was. Scared me out of my mind.

What would the warning signs be that I might need to go see a doctor to do a longer taper? I'm hoping I'll be fine and won't need anything. It's just... Again, I really don't want to experience anything like that again. It was so bad. I couldn't even get up off the couch by myself without help the back pain was so bad.

Its more of a psychological thing, I just want to relax and forget the shit around me. Just forget everything what happened, my problems right now, my anxiety about the future.

I'm becoming the ""old me"" again which kinda sucks, I was always the quit and patient guy, did everything for others and never showed my true emotions which resulted in inner tension and anxiety. 
Benzos took that edge away, they made me feel less anxious, more like myself and relaxing. It made me forget the shit around me and everything that happened in the past and I just could relax and be in the present moment. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm very lucky that I no longer have brutal withdrawal symptoms and that I have more energy, normal sleep and feel human again, but I also don't want to be my old self again. Maybe should see a therapist, but I don't have the money.

The military stuff is irreverent but worth mentioning for context. During my second deployment while in Iraq something happened..blah blah blah, throwing me into the wonderful world of never ending gas lighting and madness...psychiatry.     


After a myriad of psyche drugs (I think I've taking them all at this point, one time or another or so it seemed..over 30 at least) I was given a benzodiazepine. The answer to a question that didn't exist and what would later put me through a hell I didn't know existed.   


I would say with some degree of assertion that the first 2 years it helped immensely. I was living life like I used to, I was 'free' of crippling crap I hate talking about. I thought, great, a pill exists to help deal with this or almost eliminated it completely...almost. And with a price I was very very unaware of.   


Time passed as it does and I started noticing cognitive problems and anomalies. Couldn't remember very recent events, ability to retain information seem to be in decline. But more importantly in relation to the drug and what it was supposed to be helping, my anxiety and panic response started getting worse. Way worse.   


Back to the wonderful world of psychiatry, this increase of anxiety and panic was due to tolerance of the drug and more was needed to achieve the same effect and keep that stuff in check.  So I was told and believed. So I took more. I unfortunately can't recall exactly how much was or when but I know the majority was at least 1.5mg of clonazepam and at least 4 years at 3mgs. que frown face...  


My mother passed away at this time while I was at 3mg and barely recall the event (perhaps some of that was instinctive and we hide things to deal with them but a majority of the apathy was caused by floating through life on auto pilot and not accurately recording things via a drug called clonazepam). I digress. 

I have a ton more crappy stories related to what happened to me and how this actually effects people who are prescribed daily for years and decide or are forced to quit. Nothing can compare to the hell it is. Nothing. It has a place in every area of torture.  


I have a ton of stories about cold turkeying, rapid taper, slow traper, water, scales, milk, the Aston method, supplements that help (sorry but most don't), other drugs while tapering, drinking while tapering, CBD and the THC thing...I've learned WAY more than I ever wanted to about this insanity,   


With all that said, my purpose here isn't to scare people but to educate and warn them. I see people using this class of drug recreationally . Hey, to each their own. Everyone sails their own ship.   
However, using this drug recreationally falls silent on me because my idea of a party isn't going to sleep or being a completely useless zombie. At least when I drink I'm a useful zombie. When I drink too much, at least it's sometimes fun. When I took too much benzo, it was just sleepy time-which is the opposite of party time for me, but once again, to each their own.

So as the title states, I've finally made the jump from the low dose of Alprazolam I had tapered down to after about 6 months of daily use. Initially when I began my dosing, I was taking anywhere between 1.5-2mg per day, split between 3-4 doses. 

I began taking Alprazolam to cope with severe anxiety I had been experiencing, rather than seeking professional treatment. Fast forward 3 months when I had decided that I wanted to cease dosing myself, as I was experiencing pretty severe memory issues, and just a general cognitive downturn.

I started looking to online resources for advice on quitting, as I had a general inkling of the dangers of quitting Alprazolam. Some of the things I read initially freaked me out entirely, horror stories of seizures, deaths of loved ones, or extreme anxiety resulting in an inability to function. All of these things greatly discouraged me from even attempting to quit, but after reading through some of the information in the Ashton manual, I came up with a plan, and began my taper.

I initially cut my dose in half, as I had only been dosing for 3 months, and I was on a relatively low dose, this coupled with my fitness levels and consistent healthy diet, seemed attainable. For about 2 weeks my anxiety levels were high, and the brain fog was very real, but at the 2 week mark, I started to level out. I then began cutting by .25mg every 2 weeks, which is pretty aggressive tapering for some people, but it worked for me. Each time I cut I would experience an uncomfortable set of symptoms for a few days, headaches, muscle tightness and pain, and high levels of anxiety. Although these symptoms were unpleasant, they were manageable while continuing to work daily.

After 3 weeks on .25mg daily, I made the jump to complete cessation. To be completely honest, The symptoms subsided within the first week off, and I began feeling normal again. I believe the two things that helped me the most were a healthy diet, lots of lean meats, dark leafy greens, and fresh fruits, and daily exercise for at least an hour. I've now been off for a little over 2 weeks, and am feeling better by the day, my memory is still pretty shot, but is improving steadily.

I just wanted to share my experience to those who have been sifting through horror story after horror story in relation to benzo cessation. Thank you all  for giving me a place to relate to others in an issue that I had to keep to myself. Good luck to all of you, and stay safe.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5264501}"

A week into an incredibly rapid taper from 30mgs of Valium (from a three year daily \[sometimes more\] habit interspersed with xanax/lorazepam use), I felt awful. This all-consuming bleakness settled in and I kept thinking 'fuck, is this my life for the next x number of years?'  I've read a lost of horror stories about quitting and I clenched my teeth, resigning myself to that being my norm. The temptation to take a Valium was intense. Knowing you can make those feelings stop, telling yourself that you'll quit tomorrow instead - those are difficult to resign yourself against. 

The bleakness lifted. I went from having the odd day of clarity to those days outnumbering the bad ones. The good, or neutral days soon outweighed the crappy ones. Then I'd have the odd day where something would make me cry or feel hopeless. It happened in the space of a month. I'm not trying to rub this in anyone's face. Everyone's experience is different. The first time I quit benzos I had an awful time of it - seizures, hopelessness - I didn't leave the house for months (voluntarily!). I think a big difference is self-care, and having some support, if not understanding, in what you're trying to do. My partner has been incredible, and this week is his three month clean marker too. It's harder now than it was with the lack of gym access but getting a little daylight - if possible - and doing a workout in your room will be invaluable to your mood. Supplements are great. I had a bit of trouble at work with a boss who thinks that mental health is made up by lazy millennials, but proving one dickhead wrong became something else to spur me on.  

This isn't the eloquent or detailed post I wanted to make. I was just thinking about how terrible I felt at the start of my second week of benzo abstinence, about how I thought the depression would never lift. It did, and it will for you to. It could be a lot sooner than you think. Hope is a priceless thing in this situation. Keep telling yourself that you'll get better - tomorrow, next week could have you feeling the beginnings of the wonderful parts of the drugs losing their grip on your mind. And those feelings are incredible. Realising that the world hasn't been in focus, experiencing normal sensations as if for the first time. Those bursts of clarity and vigour were honestly worth the black, tired days. And those bad days will become a memory, a tiny blip in the life you lead that is whole and real.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44929314}"

I might have fucked up here...,"Some background: I've been prescribed Xanax 1mg as needed for panic attacks for about a decade, never had a problem with them. Then my psychiatrist wanted to switch me to clonazepam 2mg because 'Xanax is too high a risk of addiction', and I said yes. Well that was a bad idea. Within a month I was dependent on benzos, took about 3yrs for me to get sick of it and finally get off them. For the last maybe 6 months of that taper I started drinking pretty heavily, and I never figured out if I was addicted to booze or benzos anymore since I could use either and start feeling better, y'know? And benzos are often used for alcohol withdrawals, maybe alcohol can be used to 'treat' benzo withdrawals, so I honestly don't know which one was treating what.

The problem now: So with isolation and not working or seeing people and whatnot, my habits have just totally gone to shit, mental health has been suffering. I've been drinking a lot. The last 2-3 weeks I've probably only not drank 5 days maybe? If that? At least 6-15 standards a day. And while I had had my benzo use under control (couple of times a week tops, but not even every week, and no more than 2 days in a row, never more than once a day), I've kinda been using them a bit more heavily. Like 3 or 4 days in a row, then not for a couple of days, every second day, couple of days off, couple of days on. That kinda thing. 4mg clonazepam at a time, 2mg clonazepam and 1 or 2mg Xanax... Sometimes after drinking all day, usually more like alternating days between booze and benzo benzos.

I'm pretty sure that the drinking alone wouldn't be enough to re-trigger physical addiction, and maybe the benzo use by itself hasn't been heavy enough to cause physical addiction either... But what about together? Is it like opiates where it doesn't matter that you're using different opiates every day, because an opiate is an opiate and you'll get addicted? Because they act on the same receptors? Or is it different, and I'm probably okay? I feel a bit stupid even asking coz it seems like it should be obvious, but I just don't know. Any actual info or some experiences would be really appreciated, there's info out there about the relationship between benzos and alcohol but nothing that really answers this question specifically.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57961774}"

I have been meditating for years back and forth and last 4 month I do it daily (2 times a day). I also work consciously with mindfulness and breathing. Managed to overcome severe OCD with this and the doctors cannot explain it.

Everyone can learn how to do it. I suffer(ed) from ADD and my thoughts and emotions are everywhere if I don't do this stuff daily. But when I do it they are in full control. If I feel anger is growing in me I take a deep breath and my body and mind wash that feeling away. Same with irritation, worries and anxiety. Same with negative thoughts. It works for everything. Seriously, this stuff even works on physical pain.

I had worked a lot with this stuff the previous month before I decided to stop using Valium. The reason I decided that was because I fell I didn't need it anymore. It also had me stuck in some limbo state and it made me depressed. I had been eating it for over 3 years daily, 15-30mg/day. I decided to stop taking my ADD medication too (legal amphetamine) I ate daily. So I stop taking those CT while tapered Valium from 20mg to 0mg in a month.

After 8-9 days off it started become bad. Anxiety, sweating, rapid thoughts, insomnia, muscle tension. I had lost focus and from here it was not easy. But I forced myself to the gym and lifted for 2h in severe anxiety and pain. Afterwards it felt alot better and I started meditate, 15 - 20 mins every morning and 30 mins every night. I found a meditation group and started hanging with those people (not easy at first). After some days I felt amazingly better and after 2 more days the WD was almost gone.

Some stressful thing happened and I lost focus and stopped meditating and go to the gym for some days and I came back into WD. Could barely speak from muscle tension and anxiety. People at work asked me if I was sick... I was sweating. I took a day of and forced myself to go to gym and started meditate again and it immediately became better.

Now 25 days clean I feel almost completely restored. I have to meditate and focus on breath through the day. I have to go to gym. But I have started to love doing that. It helps me with everything like the breakup with my ex 3 months ago which I now have moved on from. I have started to feel amazing and tonight I am going on a date :)

I know how damn hard it is to focus while in the mud and for some people working out is out of the question. But try to do it, if even only take a walk. Try guided meditations on Youtube. Even if you fail you are one step closer to freedom. Stay busy and try to hang out with friends. DO NOT google symptoms and seriously try to stay away from this sub. If possible read The Power of Now with Eckhart Tolle. 

Your thoughts are not your friend right now so don't give them power! Don't focus on how bad you feel. Don't focus on that you may have a long time left before you are free. No one knows anyway. Focus on the now and try to make the now as good as possible. If you do this it will be easier and you will gain a really powerful tool that you will thank yourself for learning.

No clue how this happened.

Maybe my doctor made and error, maybe I just somehow messed up by taking .25mg more a day because it was ""as needed"" and I've been higher anxiety the last few months.

But yeah, I'll skip all the math... long story short my next 15 day supply doesn't come in til May 1st.

I have enough to last me til Monday.

I have no clue how I got to this point because some days I've been taking 3/4 my dose and saving some up because I was doing better. But yet, here I am.

I'm going to talk to my doctor on the phone maybe tomorrow and I don't know what to do. I haven't had a problem taking more than needed for 2 and half years. That's not the patterns of an addict.... I pray he knows that and gives me like 7 days to hold me over til then. In the years going to him he's never questioned how much I take or implied there was any problems.

But there's the chance he might not. I don't know if it's illegal for him not to or what.

So I dang near had a panic attack when I heard this. But I'm coming to accept that I am perhaps screwed. If I get taken off I probably just want to go off for good.

I'm scared. This will be my 2nd time going through detox. I did similar for some sort of overconsumption many years ago... I spent like $1200 to essentially go to like a program where I talked about how I felt and some other... to be honest, useless Cognitive Behavioral Therapy stuff. Was a waste of time and money but I guess people were around to make sure I didn't have a seizure while I was there during the day time. Nothing my roommates wouldn't notice, lol.

I don't have 1200 to spare for something that was useless. I survived last time. Don't get me wrong it was painful, especially the 2nd and 3rd day without it... but I think because I was only on 1mg a day I got off relatively easy for going cold turkey.

So at the same time I'm scared of the detox because it's obviously going to be shit, but yeah... I feel I'll be all right?

Anyways sorry for ranting and babbling. It's an upsetting news for me. Not just that I may be screwed but the fact that perhaps I am an addict and didn't even know it. But what kind of addict only takes 0.25mg more per day?

**Now to my main point:** what should I do to minimize the withdrawels if it comes to that?

I've been taking L-Theanine, Passionflower and Milkthistle supplements as well as trying to get a lot of magnesium (I use Glycinate if I wanna supplement)... but I'm unsure what else I could possibly be doing to reduce the impact. Will start doing some lighter exercise... any ideas for supplements? Things to keep me distracted?

I could possibly taper doing 1mg tomorrow, 0.5mg for two days, and then 0.25mg for the last two days... would that make it any easier?

Fuck these bullshit meds. I mean at the same time I really like them because they have been the only thing to ever consistently manage my general anxiety disorder and malfunctional adrenal responses... but at the same time... like... what the fuck.

The most difficult thing I’ve ever gone through.,"**Sorry if this seems dramatic. I promise I am doing way better now, and I’m just sharing my experience.**

I was prescribed Klonopin when I was 17 years old (I’m now 20) for generalized anxiety, OCD related behaviors, and body image issues. Good student, scholarships to various colleges, 4.2 GPA, but mentally very unwell and no friends because I was so anxious and depressed for most of middle and high school. I took Klonopin for more than 2 years (somewhere around 1-2 mg per day, it varied), and unlike what other people say about this being a miracle drug, it never really worked for me. I was still dysfunctional. Maybe because my anxiety was usually due to maladaptive thoughts stemming from abuse rather than a physiological fight or flight response/panic attack. 

2018-2019, I was dealing with a humiliating sexual experience at home. Basically involving my mom sharing nude photos of me with other family members, and me being continually shamed, which I still am to this day even though I never sleep around. And then I was raped. Even though it wasn’t my fault technically, I could have been more careful instead of stepping out when I was dissociating and super vulnerable.

A week after the rape, in sort of a manic frenzy, I took around 20 mg of Klonopin and a bit of wine. While I did not technically overdose, I was put in a mental hospital for 10 days and told that I couldn’t take Klonopin and stopped cold turkey, which I was initially fine with because I didn’t think I was addicted. But I was clearly addicted, as is almost everyone who takes this drug daily for more than just a few months.

I was put on an anti-seizure medication/mood stabilizer Depakote, which stopped me from dying, but didn’t stop the severe suicidal depression, dissociation (literally felt like I was walking in a brightly colored nightmare), strange moments of mania, almost daily panic attacks, joint/muscle issues from constant tense muscles, shaking (I had a hard time using a fork for the first 2.5 months), extreme weight loss, and even some early symptoms of paranoia/psychosis (I thought people could read my mind and spy on me sometimes, and I got scared that I had missing organs or appendicitis). I might have gotten seizures too? But I’m not sure. All I know is that for months I was constantly shaking and felt trapped in my own body and existence.

I also developed other symptoms after I stopped Klonopin, though I’m not sure if it’s because of withdrawals. Here are some of the weirder symptoms: bad acne (it got so bad I’m now on Accutane, and my normally drier normal skin became so oily my hair would be super greasy 4 hours after a shower), decreased cognitive function (I feel dumber), low appetite, TMJ disorders, muscle pains when exercising, **horrible nightmares**(I’m shaken up the next day, it’s often violent and traumatic), night sweating/stress sweating (I normally never sweat), and really bad involuntary twitching. My body is always super tense. **Also, really bad memory and derealization for some reason. Not sure if this is just part of my anxiety, or benzo withdrawals.**

I flew to a liberal arts college to start school a month after stopping Klonopin but I had to leave in a month due to my mental state. And return back to my parents

Luckily most of these symptoms have gotten quite a bit better, but I need to seek treatment for some of these physical symptoms that seemed to be triggered. However, my family will never forgive me. They think I faked my rape and suicide for attention or something. Still shame me for the very things that made me feel bad. They don’t even comprehend that I’m going through withdrawals, and when I tell them, they ignore me or tell them that it was my choice to tell the doctors I took too much Klonopin. The reason I’m going through all of this is due to me just being depressed, and being too sensitive. I told my mom she never cares about listening to my health issues even though she gets mad at me for not sharing, and she said “well you were mean to me in the hospital, even your aunt and cousins know your true side!” The reality is yes, I told her to leave, and I was reactive instead of staying calm, but I wasn’t even yelling, and it was because she said something very mean after I shared my assault

this is my third attempt to taper myself down with Diazepam. First of all i dont get my benzos from a doc. Do you guys have any experience with getting help from doctors even though you are a ""criminal"" for getting benzos illegaly? 

I am using Benzos since the october of 2018, started with alprazolam 2-3 days a week (2mg) for my social anxiety and Depression (diagnosed). At the beginning of 2019 i decided to taper myself off with Diazepam (10Mg) but some stroke of fates f***** me over and i dropped my plans. 2 damn times within 5 Months... Now i am currently at 25mg of Diazepam (tappered down from 30mg) and got like 90 Diazepam pills left, this i my final attempt because i dont want to life like this anymore, even though the meds helped me. I dont want to Play the victim here, it was absoutly foolish from me to take these medications on a daily but now i want to break free from these chains. 

Going to a Hospital or rehab is not a option because a: Covid 19 and b: my mother is financilly depended on my money and on my help becuause she got cancer and diabetes, the docs told me she wont live that long anymore...i hate myself for being such a piece of shit at the end of her lifetime. My Father died as i was 9 years old and the rest of my Family is dead or dont want to see us. Sorry for being a whiny bi*** but i think thats important to notice because i got literally no support. 

So this is my plan: I want to cut 5 mg every week, i know this could be dangerous but i got no other Options. So i am asking you guys what helped you going trough the taper phase? 
I've got Phenibut, kratom, Magnesium and some stronger benzos for hard days (Meetings, Job interviews) 

I am 21 years old (male) Living in germany and no one knows about my addiction not even my mother or best friends(I got 3 of them). My ex used to know about my addictions but i left her at end of 2019 because i dont want her to be with a useless drug addict and she deserves better, she was okay with it, also i thought its better to battling this demon alone. 

Now 4 Months later i am beginning to realize how important it is to speak about my addiction but i got no balls to open up about this. Also i am about to graduate in 2 Months (wrting my finals in 2 weeks). I want to see a therapist after i graduate. My fear is that i wont get any help with my dirty past... also my mother would be so dissapointed in me for getting addicted to those meds. She always warned me that medications are sometimes dirtier than street drugs...should have taken this advice seriously. 

So to Keep it short: 
What helped you guys the most?
Is a detox Center necessary? 
Was the anxiety/Depression more of an agony after the withdrawal? 
Is it possible for me to enjoy things again after the wd's?

I finally grew tired of it all and went to one of the top-notch psychiatric clinics in the State to seek intensive outpatient care. A psychologist, after a long and in-depth interview, prescribed me hydroxyzine (or Atarax): a non-addictive, non-habit-forming, non-benzo that is primarily used as an antihistamine, but also exhibits anxiolytic effects and has been known to be beneficial in treating benzodiazepene withdrawal.

It has been 48 hours into taking this medication -- once every six hours for me, but ""as needed"" for anxiety/withdrawal symptoms -- and for the first time in months, if not years, I am no longer counting the seconds on the clock. I am no longer wondering whether my next dosage is coming from. And I am no longer scheduling Uber rides to the ER before cancelling them at the last second before rescheduling them, and so on.

My anxiety is at a perfectly tolerable level. I feel no compulsion to re-dose. It does make one drowsy, but this is a particularly good time in human history for naps. And it's not something that any physician or pharmacist is going to be wary about refilling.

I am not writing to promote this as a miracle cure; everybody responds differently to ... well, everything. And I will be following this up with a barrage of AA meetings and intensive outpatient care. But for me, this has been a miracle. For the first time in years, I feel like I am able to lead a (relatively) normal life, and existence is (once again) beautiful to me, but not in any stoned or trippy sense.

Has anyone else experienced success with this medication? It's the early stages for me, but I feel completely at ease, haven't touched a benzo in 48 hours, and am both miraculously alive and chilled out on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

#### 3.3.2. Tolerance

A major disadvantage with BZDs is that tolerance to their therapeutic effects develop relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. **Tolerance develops to hypnotic effects within days to weeks, to myorelaxant effects within weeks, to anticonvulsant effects within weeks to months, and to anxiolytic effects within months \[**[**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B1-jcm-07-00017)**,**[**8**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B8-jcm-07-00017)**,**[**83**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B83-jcm-07-00017)**,**[**96**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B96-jcm-07-00017)**\].** This explains why patients commonly increase dosage over time and many eventually take more than one type of BZD after the first loses effectiveness \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B1-jcm-07-00017),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B3-jcm-07-00017),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B4-jcm-07-00017),[73](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B73-jcm-07-00017),[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B79-jcm-07-00017)\]. **While therapeutic effects are subject to tolerance, adverse effects often are not,** with cognitive, depressogenic, and disinhibiting effects typically persisting long-term when present and increasing in risk if doses are increased in response to therapeutic tolerance \[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B8-jcm-07-00017)\]. Because tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develop more slowly than tolerance to sedating effects, patients may take more BZDs to achieve desired effects (e.g., hypnotic, anxiolytic or even euphoria in recreational abusers) which may cause sudden respiratory depression, hypotension and/or death \[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852433/#B3-jcm-07-00017)\].",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7045446}"

In a lot of cases I think the fear of withdrawal as mistaken for withdrawal. I see a lot of people coming off like .5 mg Klonopin being advised to taper in incredibly small increments that are just unnecessary. In these cases I think that it would be wise to advise people that a lot of what they’re experiencing as withdrawl is merely in their head. It’s not incredibly uncommon to see a post where someone is like “I took a quarter milligram of Xanax for two months and five months after I’m suicidal and having panic attacks all the time, When will I heal from this horrible drug.” What I usually see is Responses like “it takes time to heal brother, stay strong”, Which is nice and everything but a more appropriate response is “Yo bud, You have mental health problems that require treatment And your xanax use from five months ago has nothing to do with it.

I’ve been here for a few months though, I had tried to go down to 10 (which I know is a little to much at once) back in January and had hellish WD symptoms, so me and my psychiatrist agreed to stay here for a while. This decision was due to the fact that I was currently in school, working an internship, and working another job and it was interfering with my ability to perform at all 3. I feel almost 100% normal and functioning at 15mg (5mg 3x a day). 

I am about to graduate and finish my internship, and I am currently unemployed due to Coronavirus causing my workplace to shut down. I feel like it’s now tile to start reducing doses again as my responsibilities are now about to be gone and I would be safe at home if I were to experience WD’s without worrying about school or work. 

My psychiatrist’s plan was definitely faster than the Ashton Manual, with her wanting to go from 15 -> 10 and then start doing 2 mg decreases per month after that. I am also noticing in the Ashton Manual it recommends dosing 2x a day (morning and night) instead of 3x. 

I’m not so sure where to go from here now though since my current schedule differs from the Ashton manual. Do you guys think I should lower my midday dose to a stoppage point first? Would it be safer to drop my morning and mid day doses equally before moving to a night time only schedule?

I was taking suboxen (8+ mg a day) and Xanax (1-3 mg a day, more like 2-3 mg/day in the past couple months) daily for the last couple years.  I decided to use this quarantine to get off both of them.  I first quit suboxen cold turkey for about 2 weeks and continued to take my usual Xanax dose.

I then started to taper down the Xanax and I ended up redosing 1-2mg suboxen for a week to help with any potential Xanax wd symptoms.  I got down to 0.5mg Xanax a day and started my final suboxen taper three days ago at 0.75mg.  So for the last three I’ve only been taking 0.5mg Xanax and 0.75mg subs and I still feel more or less fine.  

My plan is to continue tapering on both, go down to 0.25mg Xanax next, then 0.125mg, and try to be done with the Xanax within a couple weeks and then done with the sub taper a week later.

After a quick visit to the emergency room, xrays were taken and an aircast applied. The hospital and pharmacies are the last place anyone wants to be right now.  After this mishap,  I have my mom Staying at my house where my gf and I can take care of her full time.  We are now realizing that we are dealing with much more than a fractured leg. The doctors prescribed oxycodone for pain management. This is a dangerous mix with her regular intake of larazepam (which she takes for anxiety). She has been extremely restless, highly emotional and showing  abnormal signs of dimentia. After spending the last 48hours with her, I feel the larazepam is a detriment to her quality of life. She has serious withdrawals when she does not have it regularly.  I have no idea how much she consumed before she hurt herself. But she hid her problems well when I would visit. She's been taking this drug for years 

I want to decrease her dosage or have her stop cold turkey. I read that reduced dosage of this can be very dangerous. I would love to find a holistic substitute for this drug. I have thought about giving her microdoses of the larazepam to ween her off gradually. I also thought about giving her edible cannibus to help with anxiety as a substitute.  Currently it's been a nightmare trying to manage her anxiety (all day and night) .  This is my first time seeing my mom like this. I feel horrible about not realizing her dependency before.

I don't trust many doctors and I feel optimistic about there being natural alternatives to her coping with anxiety. I feel that the larazepam is causing her more damage than good.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a simmilar experience.

Edit : please note that my mom's prescribed medication has not been reduced. She has been requesting higher dosages more frequently which her doctor advises against.

I also wanted to note that after some initial research into larazepan, it seems as though that it's not to be taken for an extended period of time. Not continuously for years.

TLDR: Taking .5mg clonazepam 5-6 days/week for 3 years and 300 mg/Lyrica for 3 months. Want to get off both of these with minimal withdrawal. What's the best approach? Doctor and psychiatrist weren't very helpful with a taper plan. Just gave me a depakote prescription in case I have a seizure.

I'm struggling to quit benzos and was hoping someone here could offer some advice. Here's a little backstory:

I developed a problem with alcohol a few years ago to the point that I had to do a medical detox. The detox was done with a rapid clonazepam taper. After about a week, I was sent home with a gabapentin prescription. I took it for about about a month until I started to realize that I was starting to get dependent on that.

When I stopped taking gabapentin I started to use small doses of clonazepam to help with my anxiety that wasn't being medicated by alcohol at this point. This was about 3 years ago and I'm still taking .5mg of clonazepam almost every day.

A few months ago I told my general doctor that I was taking them (they're not prescribed to me) and wanted to quit and I asked her for Lyrica because I heard it was a better version of gabapentin which helped me in the past. She prescribed it to me and confirmed that it wasn't addictive, which obviously isn't the case. I also went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me depakote to prevent seizures when I stopped taking the clonazepam (I haven't taken that yet). Neither doctor gave me any actual taper plan or anything, they basically just told me that I could stop since it's a low dose.

The problem is it's hard for me to just stop. I'm now still taking the .5mg of clonazepam almost every day while ALSO taking 300mg of Lyrica almost every day (I usually don't take them both on the same day). The Lyrica is actually helping a lot with anxiety and mood and I'm starting to crave it on off days which is making me nervous. I REALLY don't wanna get addicted to Lyrica as I hear the withdrawal could be worse than benzos. I've been taking it for about 3 months now, about 4-5 days/week but for the last couple weeks it's been pretty much every day. I already notice a tolerance developing and have a really bad feeling about continuing this drug despite the benefits I'm seeing from it.

Now the question is what do you guys think is the best approach for stopping both of these drugs? Should I taper both at the same time or one at a time? Which one would you do first?

Got started on ativan daily by my PCP ~9 years ago and was on Librax for a year or two before that. Initially for stomach issues (didn’t know then that I can’t tolerate dairy), and then ativan came in during a time of extreme stress with chronic pain. Doctor was “old school” about it. New doctors a few years ago who are super understanding and supportive while still encouraging me to get off of daily use. Which brings me to the question...

When do I just quit? The daily dose has been .5 mg since almost the beginning, I got down to .25 after taking half a pill every other day then dropping down to .25 everyday once irritability/insomnia went away. Withdrawal symptoms have always been very mild, just a little irritability and a harder time falling asleep, for a week or so.

I’ve been on .25 for a few months now and lately have noticed if I miss a day, nothing much really happens. Am I good to just stop? Or go down to every other day? My biggest concern is seizures, but I have a feeling that’s just anxiety brain talking at this point. Definitely ready to be done painstakingly cutting the tiny .5 mg pills in half lol and super ready to be done worrying about getting refills.

I’ve noticed some discontinuity among the posts I find here, and I wanted to attempt to clear something up for myself, so that I may share with patients struggling. 

I’m reading a lot of conflicting information about using Valium to taper. My understanding is that due to its long half-life and larger dose equivalencies, Valium  reduces the intensity of symptoms during the acute withdrawal process by allowing for a slower titration process.

I could agree that would extend the withdrawal process a bit, but I’m reading reports of people saying they are 12-20 months off of Valium and still dealing with some level of symptoms. Isn’t the point of a Valium taper to reduce or in some cases eliminate PAWS?

I used Xanax back in September for maybe a few weeks before I realized how retarded I was and went CT with no issues. I was at 1-2mg a day.

Here I am again: I used benzos for about 3 weeks, took a week off, then was on them for a week and a half. Just a couple weeks ago, I felt no major WD symptoms: brain fog, insomnia, and generally feeling lousy/depressed. I’m already depressed so I guess I’m pretty used to that. 

Anyway, I just stopped taking them yesterday at 11 pm (after a week and a half of daily use). At the time of writing this post I’ve been off benzos for about 18-19 hours. I intend to be off them for good this time, I’ve read enough and heard enough from more experienced individuals and I realize the damage I’m doing to my brain, and I want no part of it anymore. I have no excuse now that I know the risks.

Thing is, back in September it was alprazolam, but this time around it’s etizolam. Same dose - roughly 1-2mg a day. 

So I guess what I’m asking is how should I proceed and what should I expect? Since etizolam has a shorter half life than alprazolam does that mean I will experience WD sooner but get it over with quicker? Will I experience seizures, or any nasty WD symptoms? How long can I expect this to last? 

Thanks everybody. I know I haven’t been on benzos as long as others here but I’m still terrified. Fuck these things, they’re worse than opioids in terms of WD and I don’t even like them half as much... damn little demons in a pill.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.81286937}"

How long will this last? I can get through this, the Xanax was short term use and only lasted 4 days but I thought I was going to die. I know I'm an idiot but need to know what I'm in for, for sure.","I had just finished a cold turkey Xanax, I only used for one month but it was 0.5mg twice a day at regular intervals (1mg a day). Had started waking up in the night with covered in sweat, so I realised I was getting addicted and after 30mg over 30 days did CT. See post history for experience but it was the worst 4 days of my life.

I didn't know you could trigger it again by short use of another.. ""kindling"" so I'd acquired some diazepam which I took and didn't even enjoy. I took it for a week straight and honestly I can't remember anything that happened in that week. I felt like I'd got fakes and it wasn't doing anything so I kept taking more, therefore the doses were high. All it did was make me angry and made me 3 hours late for work because I was unconscious one night after having it.

Here's my timeline:
Xanax cold turkey began, I had been taking it for 30 days straight only I discontinued 19th March… it ended on 25th after gradually diminishing waves and I felt great by then.

Between 19-24 March it was in full swing, I'd say hours 42,72 were worst,I was incapacitated (see previous post, and mentally I was a wreck, I couldn't even eat, retching, full body shakes and nerve shocks, muscles tensing - every single one in my body). About 8 nightmare a night, waking up drenched in sweat. Hypochondria, light insensitivity, motion sickness, any artificial light gave me the worst headache.

24th - 25th March I had no benzo and felt great. I was over it! Recovering.

Then, I got Diazepam shipment arrive I ordered prior.. which I thought cool I'll try it. Without knowing the risks that I'd withdrawal again. Here's the timeline. They were blistered pharma so I'm quite confident they were dosed properly.

March 29 -  20mg

March 30 - 80MG dont even know I just kept going

March 31  - 0mg (it didn't seem to have been doing anything but making me angry so I stopped)

April 1st - 50mg?

April 2nd  - 40mg? I popped them like sweets

April 3rd - 20mg only, felt fine 

April 4th: cold turkey, my memory was fucked I had breakfast twice and two showers, it got to 3pm and I had a shower girlfriend asked what the hell am I doing because I'd had one. I said I forgot. Every hour was waking up from amnesia. I'm guessing it was some delayed onset

April 5th: 0mg, felt fine but over emotional, also I couldn't sleep untjl 3am 

April 6th: Was ok but triggered and easily upset, and I was wide awake until 4am as If I was on amphetamines (had same with Xanax withdrawal) and had to get up for work early still. I began thinking I had diabetes.

April 7th: Very tired two days bad sleep. Felt tired, and had a nap, this is how I knew withdrawal has begun because it was like a compilation of absolutely horrific nightmares. I woke up covered in sweat too (I never normally sweat in bed).

Became convinced I was dying of organ failure yesterday. None of the really bad physical symptoms felt from Xanax so far  it's more gradual. I just had a nap because hadn't slept well and I had about 6 really intense nightmares in an hour that I thought were real. Really vivid dreams, woke up covered in sweat. The only time I ever felt that before was with Xanax withdrawal. I've also been having mood swings in past day which was a precursor.

The dreams are something else.. I wonder what the mechanism is behind it. They're always related to something going on my life and they're always intensely vivid, and there are loads of them. Before I ever tried benzos I'd rarely dream full stop.

We've had a mouse problem, doesn't bother me that much really, but the dream I just had played out like a mouse based horror film. It was fucking terrifying. I had a torch, pointed it as I heard something, and the mouse was there, it looked evil and had red eyes. As soon as it saw the light it sprinted AT me and then thousands more appeared covering me head to toe, later in the day I was in bed and I was strapped down to it and began being eaten by thousands of mice. 

The second dream, which much be to do with the health anxiety I got yesterday, I had been diagnosed with end stage illness and was spending the last week's of my hospital alone due to the Corona thing (I didn't have Corona). My family were not allowed to visit, and the nurses were too busy to look after me. I slowly deteriorated feeling worse and worse, knowing nobody was there for me, until finally everything went dark (woke up sweating and confused).

This was a 90 minute nap, and the dreams both felt like days of content. Both were horrifying. The brain is a weird thing. In a way I'm relieved because I was feeling weird past 24h elately and legit thought something was wrong with me. Then I remembered the valium consumption. Just hope it doesn't get too intense as it was short term and the dreams end soon. With Xanax it got so bad I had to isolate myself from my girlfriend. She didn't know I'd been using but whenever she spoke to me I had to tell her to stop because I couldn't handle the stimulantion. Feeling pretty bad now but mildly. The health anxiety is worst, before I fell asleep I'd accepted I had diabetes and had irreversible organ damage. 

Also the dreams what the fuck, I've never had dreams like this in my life. Ever. Normally my dreams are either dreams I forget, or random shit. Benzo dreams arena glimpse into Hell and you get 6-7 a night not just 1 with full recall.

Shit is evil and makes you psychotic, I've never had thoughts like that before, it's like a temporary psychosis.

So guys.. it's only day 4, but I only used valium.it for a week yet I probably rekindled. It's going to be a lot more protracted I guess, but less risky in a way, and shorter term use is definitely a good thing because I'm looking at a short withdrawal not years or months. I'm aware half life is like.. 100 hours so it's probably been the first halving causing the symptoms atm. If it really takes about 3-5 half life's I'm looking at maybe a further 10 - 20 days? But when will it peak is my main concern. I know at some point it will start getting a lot easier.

Since diazepam metabolites stick around for an eternity, am I in for an entire month of horrible nightmares and sweating? When is it going to peak at its worst? And how long will this one last?

I get that's subjective, but when I started coming off Xanax someone gave me a really accurate answer that I'd be fine within a week and just push though due to it being only 1 month use. 

So how long, and how bad will it get? Given its only a week. I'm starting to feel dizzy which was the worst part of Xanax, it was like being on a boat, and brain zaps. Got some melatonin to sleep and anti nausea pills just in case though.

- vitamin D, magnesium, ashwagndha sensoril, vitamin C, b complex
- CBD Oil + cbd vape when needed 

Thinking about (I agree some are controversial) 
- adding NAC 
- Niacinamide + niacin (higher doses)
- Kava 
- and finally nicotine replacement therapy - I am a non smoker but have heard that it can be useful but also is a stimulant so can make withdrawals worse) would like some advice

I am currently 
- seeing GP and psychologist (seeing psychiatrist tomorrow)
- doing yoga/meditation (yoga with Adriene is great FYI)
- home gym (lockdown) and cycling 
- good sleep hygiene + healthy diet
- tapered off escitalopram as was causing me insomnia and put on pregabalin 100mg 3x a day (helps anxiety and benzo withdrawals)

. I am at home due to lockdown so makes my taper slightly easier with less stresses. But at the same time I am desperate to come off these drugs. I know I’m playing with fire with all these supplements/nicotine) but I just want to be prepared to whatever the next few months will be. .

2020-04-06 17:02:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/fw6yfy/need_some_help_and_advice/,Need some help and advice,"Alright guys, so I haven't posted here much but I am consistently on it reading through other people's stories and trying to help where I can/learn where I can. I need some help and advice from you guys because until recently, I was a high-functioning addict. I am poly, when high functioning I was only addicted to kratom and clonazolam (not pam) that I was self medicating for my anxiety at first (started with etizo, switched to clon) and as you all know self medicating for an issue never goes how it's supposed to in your head, and so inevitably I became addicted to the etizo, and the clonazolam by extension. So there i was at the time, addicted to Kratom and Clonazolam, but high functioning as long as I had both without the withdrawals. Fast forward to about 4 months ago, I ran out of Clon and I work (or worked at this point due to the state of the world, the nature of my profession, etc.) In oilfield. So basically, very long hours, no days off for typically more than a month, and VERY physically demanding labor between the actual technician part of keeping our shit up and running. Sounds like a rant but I'm getting to the point sorry lol. So anyway, worked a hard job with no days off and cannot call in sick without huge problems because I am ""essential"" or so we are told. Ran out of Clonazolam before my order came in and was looking at another 2-3 days before my order came in. So I was looking at 2-3 days of complete benzo WD and dealing with that while having to work 16-18 hours a day mostly. Was feeling like shit obviously, so I started micro-dosing F-Phenibut to provide SOME kind of relief to make it through the days. Got my shipment in, I was good, but kept microdosing F-Phen at the same time to help a little more with falling asleep given my tolerance to Clonazolam and Kratom, as they did not help me sleep until I got tired very late into the night without taking more than my maintenance dose of Clonazolam to put me to sleep and for the past 2 years I have just been trying to maintain my doses just enough to prevent WD's and function, not get high. Again, long post, if you're still reading I appreciate it and I'm almost done with giving a little bit of backstory info. So at that point, I was taking my Kratom and Clonazolam for my addiction, and F-Phenibut for no good fucking reason honestly. But continued this until I figured shit what's the point of taking F-Phen anymore I'll save it for when I need a little relief if I run out. So I didnt take my dose of F-Phen, thinking nothing of it. Cue me going into a horrible WD out of nowhere with me not realizing for a bit why it was happening as I had just taken my doses of everything else. So obviously, I realized within about 30 minutes the only thing that had changed was not taking my F-Phen dose. Inadvertently, I had gotten myself hooked on it from taking it for too long, not necessarily too much, just for too many days straight. Me being stupid. At that point, hooked on those 3 drugs. So now, sorry for the long post with backstory, but now I have found myself addicted to 3 different substances, after fighting to taper the first 2 down in the first place, and it's overwhelming as I do not know where to turn, who to talk to, or what my next step should be because I already wanted off of the Clonazolam after all of the ""Benzo"" withdrawals from it, the way everything has controlled my life, and have been fighting for a long time to taper down and get off of it all and still function as best as I can. It was a very slow taper to start with, but now with the F-Phenibut thrown in I'm not sure what to do, and honestly just kind of need some support along with advice, experiences, any kind of help is appreciated more than I can express. So anyway, thanks guys and if you took the time to read this and respond it means everything to me because I am in a bad place and lost at the moment.

I haven’t posted in a while because I was actually doing fairly well - until about three days ago, or maybe two - who knows what day it is anymore? Before then, I had a few minor annoyances, like not being able to work out as hard as I used to when taking Klonopin which was frustrating because fitness really helps with my serotonin levels, and having hallucinations (which are actually more entertaining than anything), But during the past three days, I’ve woken up with chest pain which seems to last on and off throughout the day, heart palpitations (same), renewed night sweats, and a sense of paranoia that I’m going to die, among other things. I find it difficult to believe that this could possibly only be rebound panic - the original reason I was put on the drug - and not a heart problem. I would go to my doctor to get more thorough cardiac tests done - but that’s kinda difficult at the moment. Last EKG, approx 1 month ago, was negative for anything unusual. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had their recovery stumble or go in the opposite direction at around the one month mark? 

The only medication I have for panic at all right now is Propranolol and I’m only taking up to 20mgs/day. 

Any insight greatly appreciated! I’m pretty terrified. 😱😢

I can't concentrate or pay attention to things like TV or videos on YouTube and it's really hard for me right now, especially due to the coronavirus quarantine, I'm almost the whole day alone at home dealing with anxiety and really absurd paranoid thoughts.

Sometimes my mind wanders and I doubt my choice to quit the benzos. I know how bad benzos are, but than I have thoughts that life is short and meaningless, so why should I deal with anxiety if there are benzos which can make my life more easier to deal with. 
I'm also kinda depressed right now, because I'm in an unstable environment and dont really have any hopes for my future. The urgue to take benzos, alcohol or other anxiety relieving drugs is incredibly huge, it's more psychological than physical. 
I remember how good it was not to have anxiety and how reliefing it was to take the drugs. 

I was always a lonely guy and my brain was my most precious thing, I loved to think about stuff, writing, reading and now I can't do things and am in this miserable anxious state and don't know how to deal with these huge emotions, fears and self doubt that emerged after quiting benzos. 
Unpleasant memories are also coming back. 

I want to change my life, I'm ready to undergo therapy, but it's extremly hard for me right now due to the huge quarantine in my country and everyday anxiety about job, my future and life.

I’ve been tapering down from Suboxone using Klonopin under the guidance of my doctor. I am finally going to be finishing my sub taper this month (holy shit). What has really kept my guilt and shame at bay has been the fact that he promised he would put me on a Librium detox to get off of the klonopin once my sub taper is finished. Today I’m at .75mg of subs. Huge victory for me.

So assuming he puts me on a Librium taper this next month (I’ve been taking ~2mg/day of kpin), what should I be expecting?

How does it feel? Is it relatively painless (I’m not a baby, but I’ve been tapering from subs for almost a year and I’m EXHAUSTED).

He was proposing starting at 25mg Librium 2x a day. Has anyone had experience with this detox? What does it feel like? Can I feel safe and secure knowing I have a way out? 

Also, since librium is a benzo, don’t u just end up cross addicted and still end up with benzo withdrawal in the end anyway?

I was always a very anxious person - it always felt like my fight or flight response was activated for no reason. When I was young this led to irrational phobias, severe social anxiety and a hard time functioning. I found various ways of relief - acting out, being a comedian, being destructive, drinking, but the internal problem never went away. I ended up addicted to opioids for a few years, got clean at 22. A year later, I still had that nagging, horrible anxiety.

I got on klonopin. 1mg a day. Stayed on for 2 years. Had a brief relapse with the opioids, and quit the klonopin along with them. This time I made it 3 years stone cold sober, no benzos. Until I went through some problems in life, and I became a wreck, and got back on them. 1mg a day again (eventually pushed up to 1.5)

I was on it for another 3 years, and quit one year ago. I just didn't want to be dependent on something. However, the anxiety is back and worse than ever. After a year, it never got any better. I feel that so much of my brain is consumed by it that it is difficult to function. 

This week, I caved and called my doc. Im back on .5 a day. Immediate relief. I feel like a human.

an alcohol detox inpatient program and I felt great until this morning. I was incorrectly prescribed 1 mg Lorazepam/Ativan every day a few years back, and have taken it every day since.

Ativan is part of what they used to help me get through alcohol withdrawals. I told the nurses about how I was on an incorrectly prescribed dosage, but I guess they were just focused on the alcohol detox. They increased how much I took and then decreased it until I was off, cold turkey.

Two days later, after not being able to sleep well, I am having terrible wave after wave of panic attacks where I feel like I could die, and I go to the ER, terrified I have to check back in to inpatient care. Instead, the doc says she can send me home with a taper prescription. It is as follows: 1 mg, twice a day as needed for a week. Then 1 mg once a day for a week. Then .5 mg for a week.

It seemed weird that she would want me to increase my dose before decreasing it, but she seemed pretty sure. Then I found this subreddit and I see people dividing 1 mg super tiny instead?

I took 30mg Xanax over a month, daily basically

Was the worst to come off, but it only lasted 4 days

&#x200B;

Now I'm on diazepam, I don't even like it, makes me feel pretty bored, irritable and depressed. Half life is crazy so it's going to take ages to withdraw isn't it? Looked at Ashton manual.. but tbh looks lke thats for HIGH doses taken for years and if I keep taking I will get more neurological dependence so I'd rather just stop. I've never used benzos LONG term. My total lifetime benzo intake is not a lot at all.

2017: 7 x 10mg presribed diazepam for panic disorder, one off prescription. They made me fall asleep even just 10mg.

February 2020: took 30mg Alprazolam (xanax, daily use, used 1mg a day in two doses, got rebound insomnias very quick and wasnt sleeping well)

I cold turkeyed after that. It was so bad, but I quickly recovered within 4 days. It was HELLISH and I am not using that term lightly. I couldnt eat and I couldnt do anything for 4 days, I was more anxious than I even thought possible and I was vomiting constantly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now... I think I'm still salvagable, made the mistake of picking up valium. I was feeling great and a week off Xanax then my valium came...  I literally took about 5mg of valium and the next day was an anxious mess, I also drank 3 beers because I didn't know about the interaction. The ""hangover"" from the alcohol felt like it had restarted the Xanax withdrawal again.

&#x200B;

Please help me, I didn't use long at all, but I have had a lot of time off work recently and can't afford more. I am unable to have any medcal help but tbh Ithink I'm just sensitive to them. I doubt downregulation happened etc, but with xanax when that shit goes out of my system I start getting severely motion sick, vomiting constantly, pounding heart, hot and cold chills (that was the day after i had 8mg  xanax in 2 days).

&#x200B;

Diazepam I need to come off now... so here's the TLDR

Approximately 30 days of 1mg xanax use daily, which was cold turkeyed and successfully stopped (awful though)

I had NO xanax or benzo in me for about a week.

Then I made a mistake of having 3 beers... which seemed to bring xanax wd back.

Got valium which I had ordered and started taking that, it has been 1 week on it.

Day 1 - 20mg

Day 2 - 80MG dont even know I just kept going

Day 3 - 0mg

Day 4  - 50mg?

Day 5 - 40mg? I popped them like sweets

day 6 (today) - 20mg only, feel fine

&#x200B;

What should I do? Half life is long as fuck, and I'm sure theses are underdosed as they dont smack at all. Proper valium 10mg would put me to sleep. When will withdrawals start or will I possibly be okay? Will they be a lot gentler than Xanax or just last longer?

&#x200B;

I need to be able to work and live and not be an asshole or go psychotic while coming off them, so cold turkey seems a bad idea altho half life is long so maybe it will be entirely different to Xanax.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT: MY BENZO USE HAS BEEN 5 WEEKS TOTAL (with 1 week wd off xanax) AND THE DOSES I THINK ARE NOT SUPER HIGH, SO BEAR IN MIND WHEN GIVING TAPER ADVICE. Chances are my brain is getting there.. but it's not proper dependent yet.

Do I cold turkey off this relapse or taper? If I taper how slow? I wanna live my life, and because I'm a very short term user, while I'm expecting unpleasantness I'm HOPING I have more chance of coming off being a mild experience with valium.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.83821034}"

Was in the ER after not sleeping for 2 days, and when trying to get to sleep, I'd get almost there hypnic jerk that flooded me with adrenaline and sent me to the toilet to puke.  ER prescribed Ativan, 1mg a night for 4 nights.  That knocked me out like a light. 2 weeks after that I used .5mg once or twice a week for sleep if I was really struggling.

Was referred to a psychiatrist, who recommended I switch the Ativan to Klonopin. I'm pretty sensitive to medication, so I've been taking **.125mg a day for 5 weeks, and .25mg once or twice a week at night if I really can't sleep or stay asleep**.

Reading all the stuff here, I'm absolutely scared to death about taking this drug long-term, tolerance, withdrawal etc. Psychiatrist said there's nothing to worry about, and the risk of the benzo is much less than the risk of having chronic insomnia for days, and getting into the hypnic jerk state with my heart rate and blood pressure through the roof.

The ironic part here I think is fear of the benzo is perpetuating the anxiety - I feel like I'm selling my soul to the devil, and potentially ruining everything good in my life with cognitive decline, addiction etc.

I tried an SSRI (Lexapro, 10 mg) and day 2 it almost killed me. I couldn't remember what I had just done 30 minutes prior. Woke up in the middle of the night dizzy, disoriented, and would've puked couldn't even get out of bed.

I was in therapy for 3 years with no medication prior. Psychiatrists recommendation is to restart therapy, continue taking the benzo as above, and hopefully get my head into a better place where I can stop it it more it to as-needed. But I'm still scared I'm just selling my soul.

I know I'm probably asking a community whose experience with benzos isn't the best, but what would you guys recommend here? Try to maintain the benzo at .125mg and .25mg once or twice weekly for sleep and hope that the decrease in anxiety of accepting this offsets tolerance? Cut the daily benzo?

I was diagnosed with GAD in 2013. Then in September of 2015, I had just gotten a divorce and had to move in with my folks cause I had nothing left after. Anyways, I was woken up at 7 am (my 3 year old daughter was sleeping next to me) by my mother whispering ""there's a man coming upstairs trying to kill me"". No crap! What a way to wake up. So without thinking I jump out of bed and somehow (in my briefs) had a knife in my hand chasing this rando down the staircase and through the house. I was about three feet away when the whole time. He ran out the door and out the house. I was shocked to see two cop cars idling is opposite directions caddy corner from the house. And I just stop. I drop the knife and run over to them and explain the dude who just walked past your asses, I just chased him out of my house. He tried to attack my mom downstairs with a knife. He had watched my father leave and he just walked in. Anyways. The dude was arrested and that whole thing gave me PTSD. If your still with me ty. 

So I was forced into a CT from my old psychiatrist cause she was leaving and I couldn't see the new one for 4 months and they wouldn't refill my scripts. So I did like two months of absolute hell. The same thing everyone here has been through or read about. I won't go over all that. But I had to get back on a set of meds. Luckily I have the most awesome dr now. She is just amazing and she does care. Who knew they existed right?! So now I take Valium and Remeron, hydroxizene and sometimes amitripilene if I can't sleep. Which is rare.

The the is I don't think I've ever really recovered from that WD. I have become more agoraphobic and can't hardly drive anywhere. So my dr gave me Zoloft to take along which all the others to help with the agoraphobia. So here I am.

Hello all - hoping you are well today wherever you may be. Do you believe there is ever a point where you can take benzos responsibly again?

I am recovering from a dependence on benzos (primarily klonopin) and opiates (began with medical misdiagnosis and turned into a years-long fiasco). I was able to handle taking benzos responsibly until I started coming off opiates. At that point, my life was a mess and I began going through binge after binge of medication I'd stockpiled over the years. It wasn't pretty and withdrawing and staying off them has been a great accomplishment.

At this point, I'm on a low dose of SSRI, CBD oil, and valerian for mood issues. I have PMDD, so that contributes to wild mood swings at some points in the month. I have PTSD, as well. To top that off, I'm also in a high risk group for COVID-19 due to having asthma, experiencing, 
ARDS previously and almost dying. This is making me a bit insane.

A series of events occurred tonight that pushed me past the point of being able to cope. I started considering darker alternatives and I know this isn't the right place to go into that, but everything has culminated and I don't feel that I have the right coping mechanisms to take on this crisis and my personal crises without medication.

Have any of you been able to return to benzo usage when NEEDED and then quit once more when things lightened up in life? It's a heck of a time right now and I wish I was handling it better, but I'm just not. I try not to beat myself up, but I can't go to therapy and it wasn't working well for me before the pandemic.

I am hopefully talking to my psychiatrist via teleappointment today and would love any advice that you have to offer.

Wishing you the best of health and thanking you for any advice.",4,"{'covid': 2, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5609196}"

I was on the medication for 2-3 years, and at a point, i was its slave. I enjoyed it at first, i was finally free from my feelings. Boy that part doesnt last long, as days turned to weeks, and weeks to months, I had lost so much time, I moved up in the world, i felt good, but my memory was shot. Hoping this was concussion related (story for another day) I pushed on, and slowly but surely the fingers of addiction had a firm grasp on me. I was anxious anytime, on klonopin or sober, I never felt good. I needed more and more every day to get any kind of relief, which was near impossible as my dr had started me on 3mg a day and did not want to increase my dose, strangely enough, I didnt want a higher dose either, for the first time I was scared of my pills. I really started noticing what this shit does to you. After another year and a half, I was DONE. I wanted to feel normal, and good. I had dealt with my problems enough to face them without medication. Getting off benzos is a fight with the devil, it is horrible, hard, painful, and sleepless. All you want is to feel better, and every day you wake up feeling worse. Eventually though, it all subsides,and  I'm happy to say that today marks 4 months off klonopin, and I feel like I'm 90% back. My brain feels a little spent, and I'm constantly smoking weed to help treat my ptsd, I have a nice job in sales and am looking at a promotion soon!  this experience has proven to me that anything is possible. If anybody is going through a benzo withdrawal, know it will get better, know it wont be easy, but you can do it. If I could do it, I know you can.

My one month 1mg Xanax cold turkey was 4 days of agony, then immediate relief.

 Assuming no physical dependence, I think the Xanax pains were actually just from rapid falls in GABA as opposed to any receptor adaptation.

I have used Valium daily for about 4-5 days now just after I'd kicked Xanax.

What's the timeline likely to be?
e.g. Xanax wd would kick it pretty bad after 6 hours (half a half life) but Diazepam half life is 50 hours. Is it likely to be gentler due to the slower drop? If Xanax kicked in after half halflife the diazepam would be perhaps 24 hours later. 

But with mathematics for a 4mg dose of Xanax

T+0 on peak 4mg in system

T+6 half a life life has occured, so 3mg in system?1mg drop over 6 hours 

T+11 (one half life) 2mg in system, another drop of 2mg since beginning

T+22 (two half life's) 1mg in system, horredkjs symptoms and most seizure risk

T+33 (3 HL) 0.5mgin system, waves are diminishing still feel terrible

T+44 (4HL) 0.25mg in system

T+55 (5HL) 0.125mg in system

5 considered elimation half life
It was bad at this point 2 days but this was the start of the upswing.

Attacks were less frequent day by day,and by day 5 attacks were gone and I felt great.


It was so intense but fast
Valium is different.. with 50hr half life timeline will be

T0 - 20mg peaked (equiv to 1mg Xanax)

50hrs - 10mg in system

100 hrs - 5mg

150 hrs - 2.5mg

200 hrs - 1.25mg

250hrs - 0.625mg


So.. I guess Xanax went out rapid, if you work it out its pretty much 100% dose elimination within 55 hours 

Diazepam is 250 hours, so 5 times slower, and it could be even longer as the half life figures I've seen are up to 100-200 hours which would make it 10-20 times more gradual of a decrease.

Will this make it less intense, and gentler, or does just mean that I'll have to endure the pain much longer? My assumption is that the pain comes from FAST drops in GABA without time.to adapt so glutamate is in overdrive.

So.. the slower the fall, the longer the brain can adjust while you're withdrawing instead of suddenly getting s shock",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48059902}"

Was on Xanax for a month, thought I was going to die coming off it, lasted 4 days and then I was fine but it was horrendous. Weird sensations constant migraine and vision flickering which fucking worried me. I did cold turkey though.

Prior history:
When I was 18 I would binge drink, knew nothing at the time about CNS kindling and shit, I have never been a regular drinker. However every Friday I'd consume about 500ml of 40% vodka in front of the computer. This must have gone on for only about 6 months. At some point the hangovers got too severe and I had to stop, which coincidentally is when I began experiencing severe anxiety disorder and had my first panic attack. Never made a link, don't even know if I was addicted from that kind of use but I'm suspicious now as my Xanax discontinuation was RAPID and intense after 2 weeks use I was waking up in full sweats.

Made the mistake of drinking beers over the weekend, as I didn't know... Instead of a hangover I felt I was going to die. I only had 3 beers but it was like I'd been flung back into the Xanax withdrawals. Was vomiting all night and felt very dysphoric.

Since then I'm taking valium (Thurs 20mg, Fri 5mg, Sat 5mg, Sun 2.5mg, Mon 0mg, Tue I felt fucking dreadful ended up taking unknown (70mg?) Dose.

Today I woke up feeling total anhedonia. There is zero pleasure in my life. I'm terrified and I can't do anything. I had to suck down 20mg so I can eat and feel normal ISH. May need more.

I'm either

A) Kindled already a lot because of my prior alcohol abuse so this hits me HARD

B) Prone to migraines or even mild seizures, because I get fucking flickers and shit in my vision, sensations of wind on my face, random inability to think properly, but that could just be me being anxious and hyperventilating. Also the horrendous headache and feeling like nothing is ever good again 

C) It's mostly psychosomatic, I haven't been taking it THAT long (about 4 weeks Xanax, now a relapse of 3-4 days Valium) and I need to chill out and just get over it. I have ALWAYS been a hypochondriac. I think maybe that combined with the comedown and gaba depletion puts me into severe crisis. Yesterday I spent the whole morning looking at skin diseases and became convinced I had T cell lymphoma, and a brain tumour. It's ridiculous but I feel borderline psychotic as everything is horrible when the benzos wear off. There's just nothing nice left. That's probably just the acute comedown and I'll be fine.. but it clearly affects me intensely.



So advice.. I'm not going to any doctor, because of the virus I can handle it myself. I have a supply of valium (50 or so 10mg). They are bensedin Galenika blister but I feel like they're a bit bunk because I KNOW my tolerance isn't that high but I've taken 7 of them in one go and only felt mildly chill. I've only used benzos for 4 weeks (Xanax at 1mg a day) and then I had 3 beers...

1mg xan equivalent to 20mg valium so I REALLY shouldn't be able to take 70mg of Valium with no stumbling, uncoordination, or even fatigue. I can take 7 of them and be entirely sober feeling. I got prescribed Valium once for acute panic and 5mg would make me disoriented, 10mg would knock me out literally I'd be asleep within an hour.

Galenika packs HAVE been wedinos tested and always came back as diazepam.. but suspected to be underdosed.


Anyway assuming I've kindled/ developed some dependence, given that it only took me 4 days to fully recover from Xanax withdrawal my receptors are probably not permanently altered right? Just sensitive to reintroducing (maybe why whenever I drank alcohol for years I'd think I would die from the hangover, even one beer).

Perhaps the alcohol triggered it again, but I also fucked up by introducing some large doses of valium for a few days. What would be a good taper for the following?

A) Ability to continue working (I literally just came back after 3 weeks off due to what I think was Xanax withdrawal)

B) Keep my relationship intact (I wasn't able to hold s conversation or be in same room due to intense anxiety during Xanax CT, fucking Diaz has such a long half life too.

C) MINIMISE any chance of receptor downregulation due to it getting used to the presence of the drug (bit difficult as taper requires keep taking it)

D) Minimise chance of me having a seizure, given that I had what may be considered auras and migraine like symptoms which felt like the WORST motion sickness (this happened mainly when I had two consecutive days of 4mg Xanax, then abruptly stopped, for the next 48 hours I couldn't tolerate ANY artificial light without immediately feeling the urge to vomit, and felt seasick the whole time). These might just be normal rebound symptoms! Not sure, I guess the fact they didn't last too long means there wasn't permanent downregulation but the fact it's so intense I feel like my CNS was Kindled already by alcohol which makes it more dangerous.

BEAR IN MIND IVE ONLY USED BENZOS FOR LESS THAN 5 WEEKS TOTAL. With 1 week of (prescribed) diazepam at 10mg/day 3 years ago), and alcohol binge weekly over a decade ago.

I'm aware the risk of using for longer but I cannot afford a CT right now. Could lose my job and ruin my relationship too.. I messed up and I can handle some pain but I need to make sure I can live my life too. I seemed to feel awful the day after valium but I'm wondering if that was actually the alcohol...

The other symptom I'm dealing with is rage when dealing with my family. I'm not sure why I have so much rage. I'm starting to wonder if the rage part is no longer chemical and only has to with an inability to deal with stress without meds or trauma from quitting cold turkey.

Does anybody here know about protracted withdrawal that can take 2-5 years to recover from fully?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7915801}"

Coupling that with also drinking sometimes and gabapentin on days where I wasn't using Klonopin, I'm starting to get withdrawals. 

Would like to get some advice for this. Right now I'm having the mental symptoms of withdrawing, but I know it'll get worse eventually to physical.

My week with using these would be for the last few months Klonopin 0.35mg - 0.5mg (was cutting this down for two months, but failed) three times a week. 

Was using Gabapentin to control other anxiety symptoms on my days off of Klonopin. 

Started to notice lately that I was getting headaches most likely related to GABA levels. Best way to describe it would be  two holes in the front of my head on both sides.

The gabapentin I was taking has been low dose though, I'm just very sensitive to medications I think.

Have noticed very weird feelings like similar to mania, dissociative, derealization, sometimes feels like I'm seeing things, DEJA VU (this is a big one), Panic attacks, memory loss, depression, and being unable to sleep.

Can someone give me some advice please? How do I deal with this?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7404168}"
