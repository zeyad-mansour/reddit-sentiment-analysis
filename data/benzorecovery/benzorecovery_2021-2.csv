Could use some reassurance.","I'm really hoping someone can help calm me down. So I had a seizure on feb 7th, approximately 36 hours after my last dose of clonazolam. I had gone through 60mg of clonazolam after receiving that amount two months prior, so I was taking 1mg per day on average.

The seizure happened just about when a 200mg caffeine pill I had taken would have been kicking in. I was playing League of Legends, and I remember having this weird visual aura for a few minutes prior to the seizure, the colors looked a bit weird and it kind of hurt my eyes when I blinked. The seizure lasted for only a few minutes. I didn't lose control of my bladder fortunately, I've heard that can be a common occurrence. As far as I remember, I was playing league of legends, and then I'm sitting in a chair outside my room and my dad is telling me I had a seizure. I was confused of course, as I had literally just been sitting at my computer playing league of legends, at least as far as my memory was concerned. It only took a few minutes for me to come to my senses and understand the situation. And once I came to my senses, I remained fully conscious, aware, and responsive during the following hours as I was taken to visit the ER. I was just a bit dazed, and my body was sore, and my tongue hurt from biting it.
From what I understand, seizures can be a lot more severe, and mine was relatively tame, is this correct? If so, does that have any relevance in regards to my risk for having more seizures? 

I met with a neurologist and was open about my benzo use, and how the time of the seizure falls in line with the time that the most severe of withdrawal symptoms from the benzo would start to be hitting me.

I'm having an MRI next week and EEG in a few weeks. Is that just to rule out any abnormalities/issues that could also have factored into the seizure?

Basically, I'm just wondering what the chances are of me having another seizure...
if the MRI/EEG don't show any issues, and I properly taper off of benzos gradually instead of stopping abruptly, I probably shouldn't be having another seizure, right?

It may be worth noting that I had quit benzos cold turkey several times prior to this, after heavy use. and while I did experience a lot of rebound anxiety/insomnia, I hadn't had any seizures.
Does that indicate that I'm not very prone to seizures to begin with?

Or does that indicate that I've made myself more prone to seizures by fucking with my brain due to years of on-and-off benzo abuse?

Was me having a seizure this time just potentially due to compounding the abrupt withdrawal with other factors like caffeine consumption and sleep deprivation, potential dehydration, etc?",8

If so, how? I took my full 7mg last night at bedtime, if I take any today would that be ""up dosing?""

I have been a pain patient due to Chronic Disease for 30 years. Real Oxy and Fent Presses are the only things I have ever become dependent on. I took meds for years without issue, and younger I partied HARD and binged on everything that you can imagine.   


The irony is that Real Oxy is the one that works the best for my pain!  


Anyway, I was trying to get an idea of what the average time frame is for Benzos as I Have heard that the WDs are even more difficult to get thru and last way longer than Fenty presses.  


I have read that Methadone and Subs have horrific wds too..  


I will be using some Benzos to get thru the tapering and WDs of getting clear of this train.

But has anyone ever tried microdosing while trying to kick benzos? I'm not on that much currently (.25mg-.5mg of klonopin a day usually) and I know benzos kill the effects of psychedelics, but I feel like I might still benefit from it, but I'm a but nervous lol

Day 9 off from clonazepam and i feel I'll recover really soon. My question was something different. Please i would appreciate your views on that 🙏 

8th January 2021

It was when I was tapering my Escitalopram 7.5 mg to 5 mg. I had a lot of brain fog, upset stomach, and anxiety issue. So i went to my doctor because i had my school exams soon and had to do something to get stable off the withdrawal symptoms. 

I went to my doctor on exactly

30th January 2021 - 

Where he prescribed me Etilaam 1.5 mg CR which is a similar - benzo drug not completely benzodiazepine like clonazepam, To soothe the withdrawal symptoms i had from Escitalopram. 

Now it's exactly 1 month i have been taking Etilaam 1.5 mg CR and i have tapered it down to half ( Etilaam 0.75 CR ) to maintain the tolerance.

My question was..

Should i taper off this new benzo - similar drug that the doctor prescribed first? Like after getting clean from the new drug, then taper off 3/4th of 5 mg of Escitalopram then 2/4th and then 1/4th? 

or

I should cut down my Escitalopram completely nil / 0 from 5 mg and increase my Etilaam to 1.5 mg or 2 mg till the withdrawal symptoms are gone off from Escitalopram?

PS. I personally don't want this new drug to continue for longer, so i was hoping if i could cut off the new drug first.

I would really really appreciate your opinions.

Just kinda discussing cuz my doctor said you'd rather continue Escitalopram 5 mg all life or Benzodiazepine where you gotta increase the dose, as low dose won't work later. 

I said nope, none.",2

I had been on benzos from clonazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam and diazepam to clonazolam for the last 8 years. as time went on, I would hop from each of these to avoid crazy tolerance building and situational reasons. As time went on my anxiety was getting worse and worse, and so did my depression. I was so content doing nothing and just taking my benzos and moping around alone rather than hanging out with friends and doing activities I enjoyed.

Last month I decided to get benzos from 2mg alprazolam a day roughly. I thought this was going to be the worst thing I've ever done and I wouldn't be able to do anything due to social anxiety, I was more mentally dependent on them rather than physically. Today I am 33 days off benzos and my anxiety is almost non existent. I was so surprised how great I felt after about 2 weeks. I would be super anxious, from rebound/withdrawal until I would take my dose the next day. I didn't realize how much of a roller coaster I was on.

Yeah the first couple of days were uncomfortable as I was incredibly anxious and didn't feel great. But as soon as I got out of the rough I felt amazing, I could think clearly, I didn't suffer from the things that caused me anxiety in the past like eating in front and around people, I actually gained around 20 pounds in the last month. My sleep is much better because I don't need to rely on a pill to fall asleep, and my Adderall no longer makes me anxious, as it was exacerbating the WD symptoms daily. The greatest change was the mind fog. I could finally think clearly, clearer than how I felt when benzos calmed me down and I could focus on one task. I can now remember tasks and names, as in the past I would have no chance at remembering your name unless i met you at least 3 times. Its crazy how benzos affect the memory.

For anyone considering to get off benzos or still suffering from bad anxiety even on them, I strongly suggest giving it a try. Benzos made my anxiety so much worse and I was clueless. I've even started to get off my Buspar, Gabapentin, and Prozac as I feel like a new person.

It might be tough for you to quit but benzos could actually be causing your anxiety as a paradoxical effect.

TLDR: I got off benzos and realized they were having a paradoxical effect on me causing extreme anxiety and depression. I feel so much better now and am like a different person only at 30 days clean. It might be mentally and physically uncomfortable but in the end it will pay off.

Keep on keeping on",17

I truly believe it's very important to remain functional as much as possible rather than try skipping time by watching YT or doing other unproductive things which don't push you forward. The latter can easily pull you in in this negative cycle where you do nothing then feel like crap so you do nothing again. The more you ""wait"" the worse it becomes.

**That's probably one of the main reasons why some recover quickly and for others it takes ages.** If you don't have obligations during recovery and can afford to just ""wait it out"" I don't actually see that as a good thing for recovery anymore. Days become weeks, then weeks become months. That's not good. Not good at all.

I've found that simply forcing yourself to do the things you'd normally do and *taking action* is the only miracle healer.

2021-02-24 20:04:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/lrsspx/the_sick_role/,The Sick Role,"In medical sociology there is the phenomenon of the sick role — a role is the behavior or obligations expected of a particular person occupying a position (mother, child, doctor). A sick role is ‘sanctioned deviance’ from social norms. A person in the sick role is not considered a functional part of the society. “I can’t go to work I am sick, I can’t do chores/go out. I can’t handle stress/bad news. The person in the sick role is also exempt from responsibility for their illness and has the right to be taken care of. 

I have been reading about depression and anxiety and came across this idea and it fits like a glove. I have spent years identifying as sick. 

I was taken off of 8mg/day klonopin last summer. I spent months in one hospital or another in 2020. 

As much as I miss the benzos, they did nothing for me. I had been taking klonopin for decades. I was staving off withdrawal, not much more. There are days where I feel anxiety up to my eyelids. There are days when I feel mostly ok. I have been breathing and practicing mindfulness sometimes hours a day (I started with mindfulness years ago and have come back to it periodically). I can’t imagine facing a crowd of people or the subway. But I don’t have to face that right now. 

I am tired of being “sick”. But I have to be honest and say that I put value in sickness — I really want to be exempt from normal responsibilities. But in actuality I want to get better, and that really begins with owning up to my distorted thinking. So far its been slow going but what else is there to do?  I can’t use benzos anymore when I know how much they suck. 

So, that’s where I am at.",12

Quit heavy benzodiazepine usage with the help of Depakote ER. I originally posted this on the benzodiazepine subreddit. Just wanted to share since maybe this’ll help someone. Took 500 mg ER once a day, it prevented seizures and helped stabilize mood.

My doctor refused to keep helping me and told me to get a new physician. I thought I was completely screwed and would die from grand mal seizures. Luckily Depakote made anxiety/panic attacks bearable. Most importantly Depakote prevented seizures.

I recommend getting some Depakote if you plan to quit. I always keep Depakote on hand now just in case if I go back to benzos and need to quit again.

I was using Flubromazolam, Flualprazolam, Alprazolam, Diclazepam and Clonazolam. Needless to say I was a very heavy user. The last few years are a blur and I can’t remember anything. Luckily my short term memory is returning and cognition is improving.

I lost my first girlfriend because of my irresponsible benzo use. I burned many bridges. I’m glad I can feel emotions again.

Benzos have their uses and I don’t judge anyone who uses them. But always be careful. Benzos changed my mindset so slowly I didn’t realize I changed until I got off of them. I just didn’t care about anyone or anything. Thank god I didn’t have seizures this time around.

Hopefully this helps someone. Depakote is easy to get a prescription for and highly effective in my experience.

I think I’m at the point that my GABA receptors are fried. I’m afraid to drink alcohol now in fear of replacing benzo use with alcoholism. Been having a lot of dreams about alcohol so I think it’s safe to say I’m already an alcoholic. I’m gonna miss benzos, phenibut and alcohol. But in the end GABA drugs aren’t worth it for me.

Im still scatter brained a bit so sorry if my post is repetitive with bad grammar.

So fast forward to now I find etizolam. Immediately buying a shit ton of it and telling myself I’ll keep it to once a week, then two days a week, now pretty much everyday. I would say that I have been taking it daily for maybe two weeks. Some days are high doses (8mg) some days are about 2 mg. I know I have a mental addiction to it now because when I think about not taking it, it scares me and I justify taking it again. I don’t believe I would have physical dependence at this point but would you think if I stopped taking it now I am in seizure territory? I don’t know if a taper is necessary because I haven’t been daily dosing for all that long. 

I know this question must get asked all the time but what are your thoughts? I read last night that dependency and withdrawal from etizolam far less worse than Xanax and other RC benzos, but still it happens and it’s no cake walk.",1

It is a potent benzo that lasts 12-24h and can last a week from experience of heavy doses.

I was reckless and started buying it by the pure crystal gram, consuming up to 100mg a day (more like 25-50) in my worst phases. 

This benzo is 2.5 to 3x the strength of Xanax and lasts much longer.

Well, I cut down my dose too much and last Friday I was messed up. I almost called an ambulance. I had severe hot flashes, horrible anxiety to the point that I felt like I would never return. I took extra klonopin that night and eventually felt better. Saturday and Sunday I still felt super on edge but not as bad.  

Monday rolls around and AGAIN I start having a body temperature problem. This time though, it was a constant heat (rather than flashes). By night time the heat was unbearable. I had ice packs on me, took a cold shower, and nothing worked. I took my klonopin which seemed to help.  

Tuesday rolls around. I finally start feeling better like I’m over the hump. I decide to go to the store with my brother. When we get there all of the study I started having pain all over. Within an hour the pain escalated to the point where it felt like I was hit by a bus. You know when you have the flu and you have horrible body aches? It felt like that. Instead of taking klonopin to relieve the symptoms, I took an ibuprofen and a nap. I woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine??

Need schedule length advice.","I was prescribed alprazolam for about 5 years as needed to help with side effects of Parkinson’s meds, which included insomnia. So there’s that. I no longer take those meds, and my motor functions are under control. 

For this goal I will separate these issues - benzodiazepine dependence and Parkinson’s. They are different chemical messengers (though GABA and dopamine do have interaction.)

So “As needed” became almost daily within the last year or so due to a few issues but never more than .50-.75mg, as prescribed. 

In early October I began feeling very sick and didn’t know what was happening. Neither did my GP, Neurologist, or the Neuro-Psychiatrist they referred me to. In hindsight I eventually had nearly every Benzo PAWS symptom imaginable and did not sleep for days on end....even though I hadn’t stopped taking it - and didn’t yet know about tapering...still just same “small” doses.

So what caused this absolutely horrific, debilitating agony? Tolerance build up? Sudden inter-dose dependency? Not sure.

Anyway I eventually realized what was happening after reading [ Wikipedia ](https://www.wikihow.com/Withdraw-from-Alprazolam)and this sub. 

My discovery was still met with skepticism by the Drs. Only after a few more months of pure hell while they tried a litany of antidepressants because “we need to control your anxiety and depression.” I was of course super anxious, very sick and depressed about it, I thought I was dying! I eventually got agreement from the Neurologist’s office and from there the psychiatrist Office as well. “Certainly looks like that is what’s happening “. But nobody really wants to help me taper. GP says see your Neurologist, Neurologist says see the Psychiatrist. Psychiatrist says see my assistant once a month for 20 mins via zoom. And she they has different ideas about tapering, wants  me to “stabilize” for a few months on 1mg clonazepam ....so they switched me off alprazolam to .5mg clonazepam twice daily “as needed for sleep/anxiety” which I try to limit to 1 x .5mg tablet before bed so I can sleep. And that’s where I’ve been for about 45 days. I’m truly afraid the longer I’m on these things the longer/harder it will be to taper off. I’ve already seen hell and am scared to go back. 

But I guess this is a step in right direction? Only because thankfully I CAN sleep now, and do feel a bit better than the agony I was dealing with. but it’s super far from “normal”.  Terrible brain fog and cognitive slowness. It’s all there still I feel, but it’s waiting to heal. 

Probably some of it can be attributed to Parkinson’s (yes, it’s complicated) but most is certainly Benzo related. At any rate it is having a clear impact on my job, family & friends. I’m not as communicable, or personable. I’ve always been a very outgoing person. My quality of life is severely diminished because of this poison.

Long story longer, I’m really wanting/needing to taper before it gets harder to do so, if that’s possible! I’m not yet 59 and think i still have some quality years left if I can get my psych or another benzo savvy Dr. to work with me on a slow taper that includes introducing less potent diazepam. (Ashton) Not sure how long to draw out my “plan” for though...I know everyone is different. From what I read slow is very important...6 months? 1 year? 

I am convinced, as are most of us, that this is the next health crisis - possibly worse than the opiate crisis. God help us all.",1

I’m a little over 90 days sober from benzos and heroin. Benzos were more my problem. I didn’t take them at super high doses, but I was def physically dependent on them, I took them from age 9-21.

Since I got sober, my body temperature regulation has just been absolutely fucked. I am overheated 90% of the time, even when I stand outside in the 30 degree F weather. Today I had an especially bad episode of it. I was walking in the grocery store, t shirt and light windbreaker on, completely fine mentally. I started sweating, felt weak and got a little pale. Eventually it just stopped, but I had a panic attack over it. Physical symptoms like that trigger my OCD. 

BTW i’ve been to the ER twice in the last few weeks and all my blood tests and EKGs come back normal. Doctors don’t seem concerned but I am freaking the fuck out. My sober friends keep telling me it’s PAWS, but I’m just so convinced something is deadly wrong with me.

And i decided to quit it cuz i don't feel well with it too, like i don't enjoy things like i used to before being on clonazepam. So i went to my doctor and asked if we can quit. 

PS. I am on my antidepressant too. It's 5 mg Escitalopram now. 

So my doctor told me it's the minimal dose, you can quit it already. When i tried to quit clonazepam 0.25 mg, i had weird withdrawal symptoms, Metallic taste in my tounge, brain zaps, numbness in head, and tingling in scalp, head, and face. So i took 0.125 mg for a week and then decided to take 0.125 mg at alternative days to minimize my withdrawal symptoms on my own. My doctor said it was psychological, anyways... So now it's been 5 days I'm completely off from clonazepam. And I'm having a feeling like my brain is undergoing a lot a lotttttt changes. Like sometimes i feel my emotions are coming back to normal and sometimes it's like I'm completely fucked up. My short term memory is getting cloudy as fuck ( brain fog ) maybe. And also i got chronic sinusitis all of a sudden, pain in my face and tingling. Head congestion and somewhat I'm experiencing cognitive issues. So is it normal to experience all these kinda symptoms when you're quitting a certain drug after 2 years? Will i be normal in few days or a month? I only took 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg to be max.

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.       

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit the following [link](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",1

At my peak I was at 5-10 in a week and got hit with insane withdrawals that I went through cold turkey. I dabbled in it for the next year but thought I’d learned how to use it wisely and I honestly still loved the high from it despite the consequences.

Come junior year of college I got a prescription for klonopin and that was the beginning of the downfall. I got hit with very intense withdrawals 6 months into use as I used it recreationally, and had to go to rehab for it. I missed my last semester of college at The University of Texas and was at the lowest point in my life. The withdrawals gave me intense suicidal ideations and destroyed me emotions.

Got back on it 6 months later which lead to another bout of withdrawals with which I used Valium to safely taper this time, took 2 months to taper off of .5mg. The withdrawals were always worse each time around due to kindling and took longer than I ever expected to get off.

BENEFITS:
Much more emotional stability. Happier 

I can enjoy alcohol again. It takes one or two beers to feel great and its so much more fun snd enjoyable when I do drink once a week socially. I used to blackout all the time because it would take so much to get drunk but I had the same threshold to blackout if that makes sense.

It forced me to quit weed at the same time which I smoked everyday for 5 years. The anxiety from weed made me want to pop a benzo they were a great combination. I’ve now also stopped cocaine. Coke made me anxious, nauseous, and the next 2-3 days I felt super apathetic and low energy. Conquering benzos had a domino like effect for me realizing the damage other substances I used were causing me. 

ADVICE:
There are way better ways to handle stress and anxiety naturally. I began to look into the work done by ray peat who is a huge proponent of using food and strategic supplementation to create a healthy metabolism, stress tolerance, libido, and sense of well being.

I would suggest to follow MATT BLACKBURN ON INSTAGRAM. I began incorporating his advice on nutrition and supplementation and feel the best I’ve ever felt in my life. The best supplement I can recommend is SHILAJIT. Look it up and order from mitolife.com. It’s a trace mineral supplement that gives me great energy, incredible mood, mental clarity, sleep, and has eliminated my anxiety. The first few days of taking it I noticed I felt like I was on a natural molly and Xanax haha. Stuff is legit. I have no affiliation with the guy or the company but he has helped me more than anything. 

Also, I know some people have touted keto/carnivore when going through a taper. Don’t do it. These diets are EXTREMELY stressful on the body, and destroyed my digestion over the long run. Sugar is extremely DESTRESSING on the body. If you react to foods because of your taper definitely do what you can and don’t eat stuff that aggravates you, but try to incorporate sugar and carbs like potatoes, cane sugar, orange juice, honey, maple syrup, white rice, and see the destressing benefits. 

Instagram accounts I recommend for the best approach to physical/mental health:
MATT BLACKBURN (the best imo)
KITTY BLOOMFIELD
DANNY RODDY
STAN EFFERDING
RESEARCH RAY PEAT WHO INSPIRED ALL THESE GUYS

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Life is better on the other side. Where i was two years ago compared to now is a night and day difference. You’re stronger than you think and with a proper approach to daily lifestyle habits, you can achieve the vibrant health and lifestyle you seek. If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

Since my friend admitted he has an addiction to benzos, he has really done well and has started his taper.

In 6 weeks he has gone from 6mg per day to 1mg per day. I did not think this was even possible especially given he's been on them for 3 years plus.

I have seen him every other day during the day and he looks fine to me and is no longer slurring. He has told me he takes his dose at night to help him sleep.

He is doing all the right things, and saying all the right things, and aside from looking a bit rough, he's making it 'look easy' to be honest.

Should I be suspicious regarding how easy he is recovering?

His supply of benzos run out in 1 week time and he has refused to see a doctor for any medication. I've asked him what he is going to do when he runs out and he has been very vague. Almost like he expects to wake up the day after he runs out and everything will be fine.

What's even more crazy is that he and his partner of 6 months (who found out about his addiction when I did) have decided this week they are going to move into together and get a new place. I do not know how either of them can make such big decisions whilst recovering from this.

In the summer I found a couple of pills I'd not seen before in his desk with the lettering dm10 on them. They are Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride.  Could they be aiding his recovery?",1

Used Trileptal for a successful withdrawal. I 100% recommend using trileptal for benzo detoxification!,"Hi guys. I took klonopin 2mg every day for 9 years. I was also drinking very heavily. I tried to quit taking it multiple times in the past but couldn't sustain and keep a job.
I had enough this time, especially with the drinking combined, and went to a detox facility. However I only stayed three days. Once I read the beginning of the AA book, I knew it wasn't the place for me, lol. 
Anyway fast forward to now and I quit the klonopin cold turkey on December 14th. I used Librium for I guess three days. Maybe it was just two because I didn't take it the first day I was there. 
I don't post on here much anymore because it seems to hold me back personally but I wanted to chime in and let you guys know that it can be successfully done. My withdrawals were pretty severe for about 10 or 11 days. Then my doctor prescribed Trileptal for the benzo detox. I was on 600mg a day until the last week. Someone on reddit had me frightened to quit taking it saying that withdrawals will return when I quit the trileptal but that didn't happen. That's why I wanted to come here and update. 
My whole life is coming together again. Although I'm pretty sure I have covid right now and have some pretty intense brain fog lol. 

I'm going back to school. I do doordash now and that's been awesome to be able to work when I feel like it lol. My social life is coming back. My personality is coming back but I still feel a little bland. 


But.. anyways.... As much as I wanted to type more, my brain just really isn't up for it lol. 

Just wanted to say that using Trileptal for a benzo withdrawal was probably like the best thing ever. After one day of the trileptal I probably saw like 70% reduction in withdrawal symptoms and maybe 80-90% after a week or so. I did try to lower it once early on in the process and my symptoms came back but after I stopped it after two months I haven't seemed to have any rebound symptoms. Ask your doctor's guys!! I'm very thankful for this. 

Good luck!",5

I used from April-September 2019. Started SSRI while quitting, quit SSRI at Christmas. Went 3 more months without anything and started taking Valium again from March-August 2020. My doses gradually increased from 2-10mg/day Valium.

With the relevant info out of the way I can say that the first 2 months were absolute hell on earth. I had all the withdrawal symptoms one can imagine, daily panic attacks, burning skin, etc. etc. Then suddenly I felt almost completely normal for just over a month, I believe that’s called a window.

The withdrawals came back with a vengeance around November and lasted for almost 2 months again. Since then it’s been a bit on and off. I recently had a new period of feeling great, that ended around a week ago.

The withdrawals are not as bad as in November, but I have 2 main symptoms: shortness of breath and headache.

I’m once again sitting here gasping for air with an immense pressure in my head, mostly around the sinuses but also inside and around the back.

This sucks and I hoped after the great period that I would be completely fine. Is there any guessing how long until the withdrawals completely stop based on the info I gave? I’m also afraid I’ve messed up my head somehow, I’m so incredibly vulnerable to stress, and it takes almost nothing for the headache to return.

I found this sub a year ago and have been 8 months clean from xanax/klonopin/ativan. I was a heavy ambien (zolpidem) user and have cut back a lot on that as well. I've been taking benzos for 12 years starting with my first bar and ending up on 6mg a day for a while, and was barely able to get myself to stop.

I still struggle with anxiety and many of the symptoms although its been easier. There is still massive social anxiety and I don't think my hands will ever stop shaking. 

Upon seeing several therapists I've been told it is PAWS. However, I've been living with anxiety and on benzos for so long I am beginning to think it is just me. 


Although I was able to slow down, it wasn't easy. It was a good time to stop during COVID but I'm barely able to leave my house for months and always tired. 


I see a lot of stories here of folks getting clean and becoming good as new, but it is not always the case. I have some hope given ambien is a gaba agonist and once I stop I may begin coming back to normal. I know it takes time for PAWS to recover but I'm not sure anymore.",2

I was always a half glass full kind of guy. That is until I realized the severity of my dependence on Klonopin. Of course when you’re taking them at decent doses, you don’t really realize what you’re doing to yourself - at least I didn’t. I just wanted anxiety relief. 

Anyway, every single day I wake up in a deep depression. All day I’m sad, scared, embarrassed and find it very hard to feel even a little bit of positivity. 

I feel so guilty and low because I’m in this situation. I cry nearly everyday when I feel the shakes coming on, or when I can’t focus on a basic task, or when I can’t fall asleep. It’s so frustrating. 

I always tell myself, just “act” like you’re okay, everyday. And I do, but some days I just feel like dying. I have no plans on offing myself because I want to see the end of this addiction, but damn it I can’t feel good at all. I just want to be able to fucking sleep at night, eat something without puking. It’s so discouraging. 

Back then I had the energy to take on whatever. I was that person. Now, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to sleep, or if I’m going to oversleep, I don’t know anything anymore. I feel incredibly depressed because I have nothing in order anymore. And that I let myself fall into this pit. 

Just please, anyone, if you can offer me *any* advice, tips, words of encouragement, *anything* it would help me out immensely. I’ve already stressed my family out way too much over this.

I was on Valium for 8 years, been clean for 4 years. Drum roll, I went cold turkey. Yep totally was losing my mind and was not in the right frame of mind to understand tapering and the right way to come off of the meds. I went cold turkey and almost completely lost my mind. Fortunately I had a strong support system and other factors helped me maintain my sanity.

I still have terrible side effects from using benzo's.   I had developed OCD, ( never ever had it before taking valium ) I also developed ptsd.  And also the usual list of problems, I can start hyperventilating at the drop of a hat when something stressful happens like driving on a high way or being a crowded space like a grocery store.  Every day I have a manic kind of tunnel vision episode of OCD, repeating rituals ( they call the repetitious actions rituals ) for instance, I'll close a door 20 times or 40 times before I feel that it is ok. Trust me I know how crazy that sounds, but I've come to a point where it's normal.  It's not just OCD though, I feel like my anxiety fuels the OCD and the OCD fuels the anxiety, so It's this never ending loop. I know it sounds horrible but I have found a way to live with it.  Enough of that my real question is below.

My question is.  What if I went on Valium again, but basically started it as a taper, a very long term taper.  Over the years I have been pondering this, that if I went cold turkey then my brain never had the assistance of learning how to function by its self again.  I just basically closed that circuit off and it's trying the best it can right now on faulty lines of communication.  What if I started taking Valium again, and it could assist my brain to slowly repair these neurotransmitters?  Basically it's like the valium is helping them connect again, then when I start the taper it's helping my brain naturally work on it's own again away from the help of the valium?

Crazy idea?

Making sure that i always know what i’m doing and why i’m doing it helps clear my mind.

- Drink lots of water, this prevents headaches and is just beneficial for your overall health.

- Find some form of exercise that you enjoy, doing this early in the morning will give you energy and clarity throughout the day.

- Make sure you are getting enough sleep, if you are struggling with sleep, get as much as you can. (exercise helps so much with this one trust me, from personal experience of course)

- Have conversations with friends & family often and i’ve found that doing this improves my mood and allows me to think straight. (if you don’t have any friends or family then not to worry, you can find people, either online or at some kind of club or something, maybe you have some nice neighbours and you don’t even know)

- I used to always be worrying about something 24/7 and this distracted me from everything around me, trying to focus on the present will help, your problems aren’t going anywhere if you worry about them more. Meditation can be a good solution to this.

Hi everyone, 
First off thank you for commenting on my post I read everything and it did help. I feel pretty traumatized from last night. I did not call an ambulance but I did take extra klonopin which eventually stopped the WDs. I feel pretty bad today and extremely depressed. I definitely cut down too fast and will not cut my dose for a long time after that. Just feeling pretty hopeless.  

A few questions: a lot of you were worried that I was having a seizure. My body was convulsing as in just uncontrollable shaking, but I was never unconscious. That would not be a seizure right? I don’t think I had a seizure but some of the responses freaked me out.

I am now in a terrible financial situation and to combat this i drink. I hate drinking i always have but if its not the drink it will be something else.

Currently I am on 20mg Valium. It took about a few months to find a drug to stabilize me and I’ve been stable on it for well over a month so we’re starting a taper.

How my doc wants to do it is cut 5mg every 1-2 weeks.

Does that seem pretty safe? I’ve seen some other taper methods where they do it by 2-2.5 mg. Regardless I’ve been waiting ages to finally get off this poisonous class of meds but I just want some assurance, if ya could find it in your hearts. 





Also side note for anyone struggling to stabilize in the position I was in. I was on 20mg Valium for awhile and still feeling interdose withdrawals. I was then put on Luvox where I discovered that it actually decreases the metabolic elimination speed after doing a bunch of research. Has the same effect on Xanax as well. It only really hit once I got to 100mg but still. Ever since I’ve been able to take doses and miss doses without feeling a difference. Which is a usual milestone before the taper process. I know everybody is different and tolerates meds differently. But just a suggestion to speak with a doctor if anyone has been in a similar struggle.",1

I have a question! I am **not** in recovery, but I do have major anxiety and depression issues. To make a long story short, I've been on and off of different SSRI's for the past 6 months. I decided that the most recent one I was taking wasn't working and am now titrating up on a new medication with fewer side-effects.

When I was on the old SSRI, my psych. gave me a script for 30 Ativan, which I took irregularly until the past month. 

In that month, I went through about 20 0.5 mg pills every other day.

While I'm titrating to my new SSRI, he gave me another 30 pills to get me through the adjustment period, but I'm worried about becoming dependent. He prescribed their use on a daily basis, and I'm wondering if this reasonable?

His justification is that once I get my anxiety under control I can come off. Does that seem reasonable?",3

Benzo withdrawal ( Tingling in some parts of head, scalp and face )","Hi, I am 18 years old male. I was prescribed clonazepam 0.25 mg for my panic disorder and anxiety disorder 2 and a half years back. Also my head used to feel numb, i had tingling in my head, anxiety and panic attacks. First went to neurologist where he prescribed me clonazepam 0.25 mg for panic attacks, anxiety and another symptom that i told (head parts numbness). He said it's because of anxiety, you don't need any CT Scan.. I felt completely okay in terms of head tingling,( pins and needles sensations & brain zaps ) after taking clonazepam 0.25 mg. Also it helped with panic attacks and anxiety. He also prescribed me Tryptomer 25 mg for depression. Then he told me to consult a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribed me Escitalopram 20 mg and clonazepam 0.25 mg x 2 times a day.  Now it's been more than 2 years, i feel emotionally numb and dull. I don't enjoy things like i used to before taking antidepressants and benzo. So now, I'm quitting all my medicines gradually, Antidepressants and Benzo!  I'm currently taking 0.125 mg of clonazepam on alternative days. Skipping one day, taking 0.125 mg dose another day. And I'm experiencing Withdrawal Symptoms ( Restless body ) Muscle tension, Anxiety, (not feeling like me somewhat) Numbness in some parts of head and face ( tingling, pins and needles). These withdrawal symptoms came from clonazepam. I'm familiar with antidepressants withdrawal symptoms, so that doesn't bother much. So, Just wanted to discuss. Will this tingling in head and face get normal in few days or a month? Is this a common withdrawal symptom? Have you experienced any of these symptoms while quitting benzos? Any positive reply!

Huge thanks for this place existing. 

TL/DR:

-Between dose withdraws are a thing
-Valerian Root, camomile and passionflower tea is a gods drink for easing withdrawl. 
-5HTP supplements also help! 
-Ginko Biloba and vit b12 help energy levels. 

-Can I dissolve the tablets in water to more accurately split them up? 
-Can you suggest end of taper prep/hacks? 

Long version:

I used benzos daily for insomnia for over 2 years. Would use whatever could get from dark web and no ideas on dosage as seldom were from a pharmacy. So probably mostly some random research analogues. I did have some in a packet advertised at 2mg alprazolam. 

Would usually only use at night before sleep but using them to curb my anxiety in social things in the evening began to become normal. 

Decided to get off them. Found info in this thread. Thanks for being here! You're an amazing resource and it's great to read people going through the same shit. 

Went to doctor. Switched to diazepam. About 6mg at night was enough for me to sleep and not feel too withdrawn. Agreed taper plan of 1mg per week. 

A friend put me on to Valerian Root tea. I started having this in the evening with camomile and passionflower.

At about 3mg in my taper I forgot the tea one night. Didn't realise I had. Next day I felt totally shit all day. I was in a bad way. Didn't know why. That night I had my tea. Felt almost instantly better. Realised that I was getting withdrawl symptoms and the tea was helping that much to hold them at bay. 

I started getting withdrawls during the day at 1.5mg. I was only dosing at night so switched to dosing 3 times a day instead. Felt much better during the days. 

Now going down to 1mg but I only have 2mg tablets and they are tiny. Should I dissolve in water as a way of splitting the dose more accurately?

Any tips or hacks on ending the taper? Currently on approx 0.3mg 3x a day.

Love to all going through this and supporting each other!",4

Years ago I entered rehab in total of three times for benzo and alcohol addiction. I was at the lowest point of my life. I couldn’t stop taking Xanax because the anxiety would be so bad so fast, I just kept “taking enough” to not seize. Eventually I got into trouble like I had before, and entered rehab for the third time. I stayed clean for years

Until Covid happened. I was already drinking for about a year and I was on a vacation and was drunk. Very drunk. And decided to order etizolam. I cancelled the order when I woke up and got my money back. Thought all was well. Then went to my mailbox and there they were.

I started off with one to see how it’d feel. And there it was. That old familiar feeling of being okay. I discussed with my girlfriend who got extremely angry and we decided to flush them. Problem was, I had two more packs coming. 

It was at bay for a while until last few weeks. I realized I was becoming dependent on them so I have forced myself to stop. But it sucks because my mind tells me “this drug makes your life better, way better. You can finally be the person you want to be.” So when I stop taking them I question why stop taking something that is actively helping me? 

Well I know the answer. Because I take more and more and more and more. And I can’t do anything without knowing I have them with me. And I become obsessed. Just like I am right now. God I love these pills but I truly hate them with a passion.",8

It took me 9 months of tapering to quit and it was the hardest thing I've ever done and I'm very proud of it.

However, even if I was expecting my brain would take a few months to regen, now it's been 2 years and I'm not improving anymore.  Some of the WD things have gotten much better or completely disappeared (photophobia, brain zaps, shaking and spasms, anxiety...) but I still feel completely off, disconnected from everything.  I zone out all the time, I'm not even thinking about anything, just staring at walls or anything that happens to be in front of me.  I'm too worried about it to drive. My attention span is bad but probably not worse than anyone in the smartphone-era, been working on it by practicing full consciousness, digital minimalism and playing instruments and it's kind of working.  But none of that helps the ""off"" feeling, light depersonalisation/derealisation...

I have been completely sober for 6 months (I was mostly doing weed and the occasional psychedelic) hoping it would make things better but lockdown and homeworking just made things much much worse.  I recently moved to the countryside because people don't care about the covid hysteria here and I feel like it's much better for my mental health.  Also I can do forest biking and stuff.  I really hope it will help.

I'm not feeling depressed or anxious, but it's starting to take a toll on me and I am increasingly worried the damages might be permanent...  if it doesn't improve by the end of 2021 I might actually get depressed.  I don't ever want to see psych again, they are the ones who made me go through this.

For the ones who quit a long time ago, can it still improve after a couple of years or am I permanently fucked ?",7

Anyway I’ve been prescribed 14 mg clonazapam a month for the last year and a half or so, and I’ve been keeping a secret. I blow through the whole supply in 2 or 3 days, and do not have any more clon until the next month refil.

I have decided to stop this nonsense and am wondering, should/can I expect to be okay after this latest binge? Haven’t had any clonazapam in 3 days now and feel fine. Logically I know I will be okay, as this sad pattern has repeated itself for a while and I am always fine, but I am just filled with so much guilt about it all. I’m young very active, have a good mind and a great life and have no reason to use benzos, aside from being an addict.

That similar feeling you get when you wake up having missed a dose of methadone/any other opioid where you are in so much pain that you can’t sleep more than about 4 hours because the last few hours are so physically painful that they wake you up kicking and screaming.

Everyone will probably think I’m a huge idiot and wonder why I didn’t do this sooner but I switched my daily diazepam taper dose from 7pm (which I thought was late enough) to 10-11pm. 

I have an incredibly fast metabolism and drugs that are supposed to last 24 hours will last more like 12 hours in me. Just making that one small change has made so much difference to how much sleep I can get, how I feel in the morning when I wake up, how I feel for the rest of the day. I can only imagine it would be even more important with shorter half-life benzos. Noradrenaline naturally spikes in the morning so having something still in my system to cover that time of day really makes a huge difference to me.

There is such a huge night and day difference that I’m confident it’s not placebo or just a wave of less negative symptoms so I’m leaving this here in case it helps anyone else with a fast metabolism who is struggling with the same issue.",1

just a post to get some advice of my good ol fellow junkies. so to start off ive been using benzos and opiated for 5years straight. ( for the information, i just turned 18 so im pretty young )I went to a detox in last year, was there for 10weeks. My tolerance was that high that it took 8 weeks to get off benzos and opiates. After going trough that missery i said to myself: Now i am really done with it! ( yeah sure...) so full of confidience, feeling better, sitting on my pink cloud thinking i can do everything now im clean. I come up with the amazing idea that while im still in a clinic when i turn 18 i can still use that last time to close this chapter. 

Long story short got a urine screening they caught me with almost everything possible and sent me away to another rehab in africa for 2months. I am homeless, broke and broken at this point, already failed in my eyes with the relapse and this is my last change, last one to fix the trust and pain with my loved ones. Here i really try my best, follow the program, try to change my people places things and thinking patterns etc.
I attend to meeting, do my stepwork and i try to talk to people with a long clean time to see what life is like.

Okayyy, Here is the part i want advice for:

As im sitting here i am in a safehouse with screenings every week. I am on anti depressants and i start feeling better time by time. Problem is lack of motivation. im already sick and tired of life and it didnt even start yet. So i am here sober for 4months now trying to find a life worth living, and if i trust the people around me life will get better, but for me it doesnt the only thing that changed is that now i can feel things again ive always pushes away.

I gave up last night and ordered benzos, opiates and smoked some cannabis yesterday night.

i can start counting again with clean time but i feel just like giving up. Because why working for a life that i am not going to like. Please help me i am desperate and dont know what i can do.

Should I just accept what i did and use again(what i want) and try to quit when i am older or just try again and again untill i see things slightly changing and hoping that that will bring external factors in my life that will motivate me?


I really hope someone can help me or just lift me up or give advice

I jumped from 0.125mg of k and I felt pretty good the first 2-3weeks. But now it’s already 2 1/2 months and every day I wake up I just want to cry. I can literally sit and stare off into space for HOURS. I’ll stare off and then look at the oven clock and hours have pasted. I’ve gained a little of my energy back. But I always have that rock feeling in my throat like I just need to burst out into tears. (I am currently) but sometimes I don’t know what I’m crying over. Other times it’s because I’m so scared about my life making these big changes. Some days are good. I listen to music and sing out loud and dance. But they are only short lived. And then I’m right back in bed or on the couch just in silence sometimes. My decision making is so bad. I can’t even decide what I want to eat. And I’ll eventually lose my appetite. Nothing sounds appealing... idk I know I’m still healing but apart of my brain tells myself I’m going to feel this way forever... I just need to let it out I guess. Sometimes it feels good to cry.. thanks for listening guys ❤️✌🏼,9

For the last 4 months I have been taking klonopin, doses varying from 0.5 to 2mg every other day. Occasionally I've taken them for a week straight and then gone back to every other day usage. During these 4 months I've also consumed about 30 ambien and 50 zopiclone (when not using benzos I barely have to use z-analogues, but somehow putting general sedatives in my body ocassionally worsens my insomnia that comes and goes, not to mention that klonopin skyrocketed my tolerance to zopiclone).  
  

I have logged every single benzo intake and calculating the average, meaning: amount consumed in milligrams / days = 1.1 mg per day. Prior to this benzo binge I have been taking about 3-5 zopiclone pills a week for the last year and a half and I have no idea if this will come into play during my coming withdrawal. The last two years I have also consumed benzos every now and then. Like 20mg of xanax over the course of a few weeks. Nothing for half a year then 20mg xanax over the course of a few weeks again.  
  

I started a taper two months ago but after a sibling tried to commit suicide I went right back on the benzos, fast forward two months and I started another taper and guess what, another major traumatical incident happened. So yesterday I relapsed and  popped 30 mg of diazepam and 4 mg of klonopin. I am still  heavily feeling the effect of those so I apologize for any spelling errors and general confusion.
The decision to relapse is entirely on me and I need to find other ways to cope with life when sad things happen. Apart from general anxiety and sleeping problems I also believe another reason for me popping pills is because of loneliness.  
  

Before yesterday (relapse) my schedule looked like this:  

day 1-5: 0.25mg klonopin and 7.5mg diazepam  


day6: relapse, 4mg klonopin and 30mg diazepam  
  

All I have left now is 120mg diazepam (12*10mg)
How would I best taper with what I have left? Considering what I consumed yesterday I believe I won't have to take any diazepam for at least 2-3 days.  
  

I am also wondering about supplements, should I just ditch things like NAC, L-theanine and ashwaganda? I read mixed stories about those, for some it helps and for some it just makes things worse.
Agmatine Sulplhate is another supplement that seems very interesting that I would like to give a try.  
  

I am also interested in nootropics for restoring brain function, when should I introduce those? During my taper or after completing it? I'm talking about subtle ones, not things that get you high or have a major psychoactive effect.



Wow this text looks way more messy compared to how I structured it when I wrote it. But anyway.  
 
TLDR:  
4 months of klonopin, averaging 1.1mg a day, sporadic benzo and zopiclone use 1.5 year prior to that.
How do I taper best with the 12*10mg diazepam pills I have left?",1

Hope everyone is good.


So basically I managed to taper over months down to 5mg of Valium, 3 times a day.  My extreme anxiety, paranoia,  depression and derealisation was pretty bad but the physical symptoms of nausea, headaches etc were slowly passing.


I was on the 5mg for a few days Then I decided to try jump down to 2.5mg and it was sheer hell. I couldn’t function at all and had extreme symptoms. 


I knew I had reduced too quickly from 10mg to 5mg to 2.5mg all in the space of about 2 weeks. I couldn’t stand it and I regrettably relapsed yesterday taking about 30-50mg and this morning 50mg. 

I’m not planning on continuing the relapse but my question is, will this relapse put me back to square one? Have I ruined the taper and need to start again? 


I’ve gotten my partner to hide the tablets and only give me them when needed but I found them yesterday which led to the relapse.


Any comments would be appreciated.",5

2021-02-14 04:05:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ljl4n8/neuropathy/,Neuropathy,"Quick backstory- I accidentally quit CT a few months ago when my prescription ran out & before that I had no  idea I was even addicted. I had nearly every symptom of withdrawal for 3 days until my prescription was refilled. I’ve been taking on average 1mg of Xanax daily for about a year, sometimes more sometimes less but that’s the usual. After seeing with this drug has done to me I decided to try and taper off of it so I went down to taking .75 daily and planned to go from there. 

Beginning of January I started to notice both of my feet were hurting and I couldn’t figure out why. Then my legs slowly started to feel numb/pins and needles. I read about neuropathy being a symptom of withdrawal so I went back to 1mg daily thinking that would help. It got worse and worse and now my feet feel as if they have 3rd degree burns. I can’t even have a sheet over them in bed because every movement feels like razor blades. My hands and lips are both numb now as well but they thankfully don’t hurt. 

I finally got in to see my new doctor (had to get a new one after moving states) and I told her everything. She said she does not believe a dose as low as 1mg daily would cause this and wants to do testing. She told me she wants me to continue tapering and go back to .75 daily so that’s all she prescribed me. She sent me for blood work and scheduled a follow up in mid March. I got the results of the bloodwork and my liver enzymes are elevated and my folic acid is deficient. I have been drinking daily since quarantine started usually 2-4 beers a night so she told me to stop drinking for two weeks and take the folic acid supplement she prescribed and come back for more labs in two weeks so it’s been a week now I haven’t had a drink.

I am honestly just ready to give up. I don’t know what to do but this pain is so excruciating and constant that I can’t even function as a human. I’m in bed all day because it hurts to move but I can’t even get sleep because the pain is always there. I feel weak and lethargic and even just walking to the bathroom I feel like I’m gonna pass out. I’ve lost 15 lbs in less than a month because I can’t even think about eating being this miserable. I guess this is both venting and wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this. I’m terrified that this is permanent and I can’t handle that. My anxiety and panic attacks have gotten even worse which I didn’t think was possible and it’s causing me to absolutely lose my mind.

To add, I’ve been on 20mg of citalopram for two years and she upped that dose to 40mg and wants me to start taking buspar as well. I take magnesium twice a day and a vitamin D supplement. My b12 was high in the blood test so she had me stop thanking that supplement for now.",4

I wouldn't consider myself a heavy benzo user, but I do binge use them every now and then. The problem is, the binge has gone on a bit longer than usual this time.

About 3 months ago I started my typical binge of 140mg of diazepam over about 5-7 days. After that I bought Xanax and was using that for around a month and a half (2-3mg daily). Then I thought I'd switch over to diazepam again because the Xanax was not lasting long enough. I'm using around 20-30mg a day at the moment but I want to get off this. 

I have split my remaining diazepam into a 2 week titrate. I'm dropping 2.5mg every 2 days. I dont really have much trouble coming off benzos usually, but that's only when I binge for a week or two. I feel like 3 months is a big difference to 1-2 weeks. 

Basically, am I overthinking this whole thing? I usually go cold turkey but it seems my ""titrating"" plan is just so I can continue my benzo use. I think I bit off more than I can chew this time though. I'm sort of confused at the moment so sorry if I dragged on.",1

I have no way to illegally acquire more so I suppose that will help me to stay off once I'm completely weaned. 

Yesterday he prescribed me Gabapentin to help ""ease the pain of withdrawal"" it is supposed to make it easier for me to go down on dosage with the Ativan. So I picked it up yesterday after my appointment and took one. The doctor said 3 a day, morning, lunch and night. 

I'm worried this isn't going to help me wean, mostly because I am an idiot and always out for any high I can find.

I don’t recommend ever getting into RC’s.  the rx are bad enough and then when you start getting multiple scripts plus rc’s , there’s very little chance of turning it back around until you hit rock bottom. that’s another thing that sucks, i know exactly what the consequences are and I STILL want to keep going. i want that warm intoxicating numbness that lulls me to sleep.again, sorry. i don’t write ina journal and i’m not 100% truthful with my psychiatrist and i hold a lot of stuff in and it just boils over eventually. be strong, and if you find shit you forgot about just throw it away. don’t turn back to the dark side.",1

I wasn’t going to post this but I know that someone out there reading this will have felt what i felt and if there’s a chance that i can help anyone by telling my story then i will.

My addiction wasn’t purely with benzos, many other substances and alcohol were involved. It’s like i was trying to kill myself slowly, I can only realise this now reflecting. My substance abuse was a way of escaping reality, running away from my problems. However this always will catch up to you. 

When i decided to sober up, the beginning was horrible. It isn’t easy let me tell you that, though the rewards are more than worth it. Seriously, it’s like the more you hide from your problems, the worse you will get, As soon as i started to face my problems and be healthy, it felt like a massive burden that i couldn’t handle, that no matter how hard i tried i couldn’t do it. The entire time i always thought of what a relapse would mean, it would mean back to square one. 

That was what kept me going, for you it might be something completely different, however no matter what your reason is, keep it close to you, never forget and always force this idea to the front of your mind. 

To anyone that is deciding to clean up and get sober, you are strong, i know you can do this and i believe in you. Thanks for reading, hope this helps someone, i know i’m just ranting but hopefully someone can relate.",25

Now They're Changing They're Mind, But That's Okay.","I won't go into too much details regarding what happened with the psych. The bottom line is that they're taking me off, and the last appointment I had with them, they said they'd give me one more fill. I have spent the last week anxiously checking to make sure this would happening on the next refill date (today) but I could tell they were avoiding me. 

I only take .5 mg Xanax every other day/every couple of days. I don't think I am physically dependent. But I am definitely mentally dependent. 

My husband keeps them in a locked vault to stop me from abusing them too much. I have ""assigned Xanax days"" like Sunday, Monday, Wed, Fri.. and I find myself completely trying to power through the other days in order to get to the ""Xanax days"". If it's a Thursday, I automatically consider it a ""bad day"" because its not a Xanax day. I only recently realize just how bad this routine has fucked up my daily life. It's caused a lot of strife in my relationship as well. 

I could find another physician to prescribe it to me, or seek it off the street, but I'm not really sure what that would do to help me in the long run. I'm getting up there in age. We did want to try for a child, at least once. 

But the idea that my ""jump off"" might be sooner than later is honestly terrifying. I am doing my best to distract myself, watch dumb stuff on Netflix, etc. But every once in a few hours, I'll remember this looming problem. And it's like that feeling where you miss a step walking down the stairs in the dark, and your stomach drops until you find your footing again. If I can distract myself again quick enough, I  feel steady again. If I linger on the thoughts, I feel something close to suicidal -- I doubt that I would do anything like that, but I never stay in those thoughts long enough to find out.  

I do have some pills left over, but I would like as much as I can of what's left for emergencies. In the meantime I have weed, gabapentin, phenibut, and (less preferably) alcohol. I got off hard opiates, I got off kratom, I don't see why I can't do this. 

But still.. it sure is terrifying.",2

2021-02-12 02:34:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/li6a31/i_thought_i_was_free_from_clonazepam/,I thought I was free from clonazepam,"TL;DR: Took clonazepam for 2.5 years, stopped cold turkey end of November 2020 without explanation from doctor and switched to an SSRI. The 2-3 weeks after were hell and I thought for the better part I was lucky and free. But these last few weeks my anxiety, depression and the same withdrawal symptoms have crept up on me again.

&#x200B;

I am a relatively healthy male in my 30's now. I was prescribed clonazepam almost 3 years ago by my doctor. The funny thing is, everything is such a blur I honestly can't remember the exact symptoms I had before I started taking it. I remember I had anxiety and panic at night but that was it. Describing this to my doctor, he prescribed clonazepam to me to take .5mg as needed when I had these attacks.

Things were great at first. I felt amazing - get an attack, wake up, take a pill, freak out a bit, sleep. Rinse wash and repeat. I discovered quickly that when I had an attack, if I just took the pills nightly before bed for a few days after, it seemed to help more. So now when I got my anxiety, I ""buffered"" my time after by taking it for a few days after. This worked too, I'd go a week or two and be fine but then like a train it would hit again. So I kept doing this pattern.

All the while, my doctor ""controlled"" things by giving me only 6 month prescriptions with 15 day supplies. Every 6 months I was required to have drug testing and a mental evaluations which I answered questions on a paper that gave me a grade for stress, anxiety and depression. Never once did my doctor really sit with me to explain exactly why except its a controlled substance and can cause an uptick in depression.

Time goes on and the symptoms of my anxiety had gotten worse. But I realize the clonazepam is a crutch so I try to not use it still unless I have to. But there were times this last year where I ran out of prescription and due to COVID lock downs or precutions I couldn't make it into the office but a face to face was required. My anxiety got worse, most days not sleeping till 5AM. I would call and my doctor gave me a 30 day supply as a quick fix. Things were so bad I just started taking it daily before bed for relief. Then 30 days ran out and I would call again and they would give me another 30 days. This went on for 3-4 months before I was asked to finally come in. After I did, the doctor talked me into switching to an SSRI but never explained why or how everything I was explaining to him was related to my clonazepam.

I started to do my own research and found out all of the horrible stories about dependency, addiction and withdrawal from this drug. On one hand I was relieved because I wasn't crazy and everything I was suffering from was indeed real. On the other hand, I felt hopeless and lost now faced with my anxiety naked and bare without the armor of clonazepam.

So far I have been free of the drug since November 2020 now and while it hasn't been easy I can honestly say I am trying to face things to become better at coping with symptoms. Working to reduce stress and battle bits of depression are constant battles. I wanted to get this off my chest and hope if anyone is in the same boat - it gets better. Maybe not entirely free or perfect but getting there. The things I really wish would go away that I still deal with:

\- Pressure in the head, around my sinuses  
\- Pressure in the ears like my head is going to pop  
\- Tightness in my jaw that causes pressure in my neck, its like eating something sour sometimes  
\- Slight feelings of dizziness and migraine type symptoms with my vision  
\- Buzzing, ringing and almost vibrating in my inner ears  
\- Spurts of panic still there, like something is wrong with me and I will die in that very spot  
\- Breathing issues, either too shallow or too deep both lead to other symptoms above  
\- Headaches, sharp pains, ants crawling around my scalp or the feeling of a band across my forehead  
\- Brain fog and just feeling like crap  
\- Burning in the ears, like heat radiating from them  
\- Heart racing or palpations  
\- Severe spikes in my blood pressure due to the anxiety and panic

I suffered this and more but amplified for 2-3 weeks after cutting cold turkey from my doctor who ""switched"" me to an SSRI. I spent more time and thought I was out of the woods but now these last few weeks I have been suffering these same symptoms and I don't know know why. Like most of you and other sufferers, I have seen multiple doctors to check my inner ears, heart and had every blood test to rule out lupus, thyroid or other things. Only thing effecting me is high blood pressure (140's/90's) and obesity. 

It comforts me knowing others have these same symptoms and are going through the same thing. Still part of me wonders if something is underlying and really wrong or not and worse, how do I know when it isn't anxiety or withdrawal?

Has anyone else had this happen?  I'm down to 1mg a day which I realize is probably way too fast since I've been on either alprazolam or diazepam for the past decade with only maybe two months off back in 2014.  The withdrawal symptoms are almost unbearable (tunnel vision, shadow people, grinding my teeth, I'm fucking scared of leaving the house, tingling in my limbs and head, no appetite and trouble sleeping etc.).  I'm also about to be on felony probation and I haven't had a script since 2018 so I feel like I need to get as close to off of these things as I can asap.  

I was thinking about going to a doctor and just telling them that I have a xanax habit and want to safely taper off.  In the past I've been hesitant to tell a doctor for fear that I would never be able to get a prescription again but at this point I'm feeling pretty desperate and really want to try to be sober.  Does anyone have any advice about what to tell a doctor?

   I'm tired of being a drug addict.  It's ruined my life.  I kicked a pretty bad heroin/fentanyl habit in 2019 and I've relapsed countless times since then but never developed a full blown habit again.  I haven't done any opiates in about a month.  I'm so sick of relying on chemicals to feel okay and honestly at this point I can't really even get high enough to feel okay for more than an hour at best.  I know this is a long post and kind of all over the place.  If anyone has any advice at all I would really appreciate it.  Im just barely hanging on by a thread.

I am so happy I found you all because I am in desperate need of advice. Here is the summarized version of my situation (feel free to ask for clarity or more details about anything):

I have been taking Klonopin as prescribed (minus the days I have accidentally forgotten to take it) 0.5mg three times daily for almost 7 years.

The most recent doctor I had for the last two years left the practice in December 2020 and transferred my records to her replacement doctor. The new doctor read that I have ""anxiolytic dependence"" and immediately started treating me like a criminal and not at all like a patient! It was awful! She left me without my medication for 9 days and then only filled 14 0.5mg tablets and said I was to take 1 daily for a week and then 1 every other day until gone. I was fine with this until I tried to refill....her emailed response was ""you aren't getting any more of this medication"". 

I was under the impression benzodiazepine withdrawal could be lethal and that a taper would be much longer than 2 weeks to be safe?!

I am very worried because I already have a history of grand mal seizures and am so terrified this will trigger another seizure! The panic I am experiencing is not helping either. It has been 13 days since my last klonopin, and I am an absolute mess! Shaking, clenching/grinding teeth, can't sleep, limbs are randomly jerking, muscle spasms, sweating a lot, vision is very blurry, my hair is falling out in very large clumps, and panic is obviously here in full force just to name a few things I am currently experiencing.

Please help me! How can I make this stop :( ? Does anyone else think this taper is too fast, or is this appropriate and safe? How do I go about finding a doctor who understands and will work with me? All thoughts and advice are welcome! Thank you so much!",23

This symptoms are normal during a withdrawal? Even if I didn't used high doses? I'm very worried about it.",1

I Am Struggling already! Please anyone that can recommend supplements or dietary changes to help during and after the taper, please chime in. I’m desperate for help. I’ve only come off klonopin one time in my life and it was the craziest worst year of my life. So bottom line, I have no choice I have to come off benzos completely. I am going to present the Ashton manual to my doc to see if she’ll add low dose Valium to help with the end of the taper. I can’t talk her into going any slower and because I’m on suboxone no doctor will script me any benzos. So if anyone has suggestions for supplements to help get through the taper and repair the brain please let me know. Don’t mention Phenibut please I know all too well about that disgusting drug. But thank you all for any input, I really appreciate it 🙏🏼

UPDATE: I spoke to my suboxone doctor today and he’s over taking the taper, switching me to Valium and tapering me off over 8 months! 😀😀😀",21

Long story short, I used clonazolam for over 2 years, around 2mg a day sometimes more. Near the end, it didnt even give me relief when I dosed. I used flubromazolam for its longer half life to taper around 3 months. Im currently 2 months or so no benzos. Havent kept detailed logs, but i know I jumped mid December. 

The first two weeks were pretty bad. Insomnia, anxiety, sweating, tinnitus, weird GI issues, aches and pains. I didnt leave my house at all during this time. Barely ate. Kinda just hid from the world. 

Day 10 or so is when it started to slightly get better. Now at two months, I can safely say Im out of the worst of it. I still have slight tinnitus and its hard to get to bed, but when I do i can sleep 7-8 hours. Sometimes more. 

My anxiety is better than it was even on the clonazolam towards the end. Im slightly depressed, but I wasnt exactly happy on benzos either. I fucked up alot while taking them. Lost my job, car, caught a DUI, and had to move back home. 

I figure Ill be working to get my life back in order for the next couple years or so. But it feels good to be sober. Genuinely. Im happy to be off the damn benzos. Its not fun, it actually sucks a lot at first, but it is totally worth it. 

If anyone is considering coldy turkeying, dont. I was forced to in jail, and having a seizure in a concrete box full of strangers was not pleasant. Always taper. I went a little fast, but i had to in order to get clean for my DUI classes. 

Also, I tried drinking last week. About 5 beers, and it was a terrible idea. I felt like I was in the first week of withdrawal again for a few days. But it went away, and ill wait a year or so now to try again lol 

Anyone stuck in this situation, Im wishing yall the best. It does get better. Promise.",33

I take the 3mg Xanax solely to ward off rebound anxiety/insomnia.  That's it. To prevent from going crazy/having seizures.

Have tried drinking coffee a few times since going CT off vals at the beginning of December. Have had to pretty much peel myself off the ceiling everytime and deal with all kinds of madness for the rest of the day after. 

Green tea, on the other hand, does the business - grants a warm, gentle caffeine buzz and you feel great after for some reason. 

Apologies if I'm telling anyone how to suck eggs/stating the obvious on this matter. Anyone who hasn't been able to drink coffee and misses it in their life, might be worth a try as a substitute.

I’m having a huge pity sesh right now, feeling like what is the point for having gotten off these? Logically i know it is good but I just feel like since I jumped everything I thought I knew has changed. 

I used to have too much fun on drinking nights (not a dependent alcoholic but would black out every time and generally be *that person* at parties/nights out), and now any drinks just make me nauseated, and not any more social/funny, which is why I drank. Now it just feels depressing and i want to go to bed, or be left alone.

I used to take adderall for ADHD/work, then discovered that having some more made gaming more interesting, allowed me to play piano for hours, perform my other hobbies with what seemed like razor sharp creative focused genius (spoiler this was not true, it made me worse at creativity). Tapering off Kpin resulted in me experiencing SEARING pain in my neck, shoulder, and jaw if I even looked at 5 mg adderall. I used to drink high caffeine Death Wish brand coffee also, but now I get the same pain and have stoped that as well. All I can tolerate is some mild English Breakfast like twice a day.

To get through the Kpin withdrawal pain I started baking to distract myself and because sugar helped with. withdrawal. Baking was keeping me mobile a little and not in bed all day with no circulation and insane neck pain. Now from having all those baked goods in the house and a habit of noming when I’m bored I’ve gained at least 40 lbs and feel like I need to stop baking and eating. Having a cookie with my afternoon tea felt like the last enjoyable thing I had left in my life, which is sad to admit.

I feel like everything I had to look forward to in a day, anything I found reliably enjoyable, is now gone. Now I’m just left with the gray monotony of a day that is broken up only by trying to wake myself up with bitter leaf water, fill myself up with carbonated tap water and bland chicken, send work emails about work emails i plan to send, mindlessly waste time grinding for ore in a game I’m not immersed in, and try to fall asleep by emptying my brain *even more* than my life is already empty, just to wake up and do it all again for literally no reason.

This is my first post here.  I just found this sub.  So I'm detoxing from Valium, the last bit kind of.           6 years ago I was put on 20mg/day of valium along with MS Contin after suffering extensive spinal injuries.  I've been an opiate user for a very long time before this btw, over 3 decades.  Anyhow within a few months of taking 20mg/day of Valium I found it affecting my memory and it kind of felt like I'd walked into a fog.  My drams turned into nonsense and my neat handwriting became scrawl.  In 2018 I managed to reduce to 6mg/day, which was hell.  Worse than opiate withdrawal in it's own way.  I've found the only thing that's been any help so far is magnesium citrate, 400mg/day.  I've been loosely following the 'Ashton Method'.  My doctor had prescribed me some Lyrica and said it might help but when I read about if and found it acts on the same receptors as benzos, I thought screw that, it's going to leave e with another similar addiction, or it could get out of hand and I'll be double screwed.

So I've managed on 6mg/day since the end of 2018 but I've decided that this year I want to be finally done with this shit, it's a plague, a demon.  I've been doing 0.5mg reductions since I got down to 9mg/day, the 1mg reductions were too much to cope with after I got below 10mg/day.  So far this year I did one cut to 5.5mg/day and I've just cut to 5mg/day.  My doctor has been supportive and has gven me some of the 2mg/5ml Diazepam liquid so I can do accurate 0.5mg cuts as it's hard to cut a 2mg pill  accurately into quarters. 

Is there anything other than Magnesium Citrate that I can take that might help take the edge off so to speak or do I just have to stop being a pansy and suck it up?  I've found that before I cut the dose, I spend a few days alternating between the current dose and the lowered dose, then go to the lowered dose, it's not quite as bad then but it still makes me feel like shit.   As the daily dose has got ever lower it seems to have got harder & harder to cope.  Any advice or suggestions greatly appreciated",3

I'll start off with my latest and greatest binder which happened last June. I was sober from all benzos for six months, as I got taken off due to having my 5 gran mal seizure in January. I found some pressed bars, something very strong like one or two blacked me out. 

I bought 10 bars the first day. Woke up the second day with a hundred pack. I woke up 10 days after that and could tell I went a lil too hard. I looked at my bank account and had 4 withdrawls for $450 each. I looked through my phone and immediately could tell I hadn't sold any. I ate 400 fucking bars in 10 days and who knows what else I found during that time. My friend came over later that day cause I needed some kpins cause I knew I'd seiz without them. He also confirmed I had been asleep 90% of the time but when I was awake I was getting into all sorts of dumb bullshit. I took 1mg kpin a day for a week then stopped for another 2 months. 

Before this when I was prescribed I had 60 1 mg xanax that would last me no longer than a week. Most of the time 2 or 3 days. This went on for 3 years. 

The other 4 years before I was prescribed I went a lot harder. I'd take 30 bars in two gulps and wake up 4 days later sick as fuck thinking I'd die. I went through a phase where I'd buy a hundred pack and go through them between Friday night and Monday. I always did it on those days because that's when I got paid. I did this for about 8 months and decided to stop. That's when I started slowing down. 

I just recently got a xanax script and kpin script and I'm dealing with the same problems. I black out and then I just keep munching on them not giving a single fuck. I haven't had my xans for longer than 2 days due to my tolerance being high as fuck. 

What problems am I going to face down the road health wise? Nobody else I know has ever talken close to the amount I have that I've personally known so I'm just curious. A lot of people here say they've been on them for a month and are worried about withdrawals and it makes me feel like shit. I could stop taking them in about a week completely I just don't habe any motivation whatsoever without them now. Like I won't even get up to get water or go to the bathroom I'll wait until I'm so uncomfortable it hurts. The last two days I've taken 8 mg of my klonopin and I feel better but I know if I tell my doctor about all this he won't trust me with anything else. I already can't get pain meds and I broke my back and have had 5 shoulder surgeries so they are worried I'm going to get addicted to opiotes too young since I'm 25. This is why I take as many fucking benzos I can is because I'm always in a lot of pain I just want to forget.

Edit: I took 10 350mg somas and 600mg of pregablin and I blacked out. Buddy said I was trying to walk but couldn't haha",30

No symptoms since 5 months off. Fully healed,  in fact better...in a ton of ways. 

I have been eating whatever I want, taking vitamins, smoking weed, drinking coffee, exercising all I was told I could have setbacks from, and none ever bothered me.

However.....The last phase to officially bring closure to benzo withdrawal is resuming drinking beer.

You see, this is important to me for this specific reason: Its the reason I got off benzos in the first place!

8 years into taking clonazepam. 5 once a day, and drinking beer on it 3x a week, I decided to look up if it's ok to drink on this shit. I read bad things and decided I want to be off the benzos so I dont have to worry about it.

The bitch is that you can't drink for a while once your completely off benzos. 

The same dozen or so people in benzo withdrawal support groups tell me to wait 2 years, that it's a rule

Rule? Was a study done on this?
also why 2 years exactly,  why not 5 years?? Why not 6 months? Why not 10 years?? Why not 1 year? Who came up with this time frame? Any what where the factors of the individuals involved in these early support groups? Cold Turkey? High dose? Kindling? Other medications?



I'm also told by these same people that one who cold Turkeyed 6mg of klonopin has to wait the same two years as someone who was only one benzos at a .5 dose for 6 month? 

Wtf????

Look, I understand they are really just trying to warn everyone that a setback could occur. I don't think harm is ment. But some of these people are not realizing hundreds of thousands have come off benzos and where not in support groups to tell them you should avoid drinking for a while and major issues most likely only occur if you had real hard circumstances or drank alot at like 1 month off, then sure...you will set yourself back, I think this is common sense. 

So here I am 18 months off , no symptoms for 13 month and ready to slowly start introducing beer back into my life. Thairfore bringing final closure to my benzo chapter of my life.",2

Here is the thing, I don't drink and I don't like smoking. What else am I supposed to do? Like I don't see how you could be sober for lers say 3 months at a time like that's just insane. Reality is I study so much material a day I get bored with my life because of the pandemic so why not take a bar to feel relaxed ya know? I mean this has been my stance on it so far but logically even if I have no physical withdrawal I may be inducing mental issues. Here is the other thing, my insomnia is so bad that it takes me 3 hours to go to sleep on 150mg of benydrl. I have tried to go to sleep with no medication its literslly impossible. How do I know this? I forced myself to take a 7 day break a few months ago and the first day I had issues immediately.  I took a previous 20 day break and took 2mg maybe like 3 times and stopped. Besides even before I started taking benzos I had these issues sleeping. Anyway what should be a general guide because im tired of being a fucking pill head and popping xans real shit. The other problem is im not only taking it to get the ""high"" , j only feel relaxed and at ease not necessarily high unless I add weed",1

Started taking xanax 1-2mg, vicodin 30-40mg, and ambien 10mg at 18 (worked the dosaqges up) ....eventually progressed to klonopin, valium, xanax, oxycodone, percocet, vicodin lasted till about 22 when I got a new job I decided to stop taking everything ( very stupid didn't know any better ) had a seizure on the job and woke up in an ambulance. I stopped doing a majority of drugs then and didn't really fuck with pills ( except for painkillers I always enjoyed those ). At 26 I tapered off of oxycodone and stopped taking it everyday. Fast forward to now I have a very stressful job that requires me to be laser focused all day. I smoke weed everyday 3 - 4 times a day and have been taking xanax approx 1.5-2mg with ketamine .2 - .4g per day at night to sleep and drinking vodka with both at night to knock out for approx 8 months daily.

I'm going on day 8 with no xanax, ketamine, and alcohol completely cold turkey. I've been taking zinc, magnesium, bacopa extract, valerian root, ashwaganda root, and heavy doses of niacin to feel better. There are times in the day I feel like the anxiety is too much and I want to pop maybe a .25mg of xanax to just get rid of the anxiety.

Does anybody know when the withdrawal symptoms will dissipate? Any recommendations? I tried meditating and that actually helped me sleep....the sleep has been brutal sleep at 11pm wake up at 2am can't sleep again. I feel like I'm jumping out of my skin half the time and the other time I feel anxious about really nothing but my withdrawals....any advice any words of wisdom from anybody?",1

I can’t get a different job unless I just work at McDonald’s or something. I don’t fucking know. Everyone’s got problems. I’m panicking and regret a lot of things. 
The only time I feel at peace is the two times a day when I take a Xanax. It used to be clonazapem. I never increased the dose. I can stop for a few days cold turkey but the stress of life and my regrets and everything just are too much. I have to get through the day somehow.

2021-02-03 19:27:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/lc2rdr/looking_for_some_advice_feeling_trapped/,Looking for some advice. Feeling trapped.,"Hi guys, ill start with a quick back story on my addiction avoiding too much personal life related info to avoid boring anyone, the main purpose of this post is for genuine advice not sympathy. I am a 19 year old male. My addiction began probably when I was around 15 using Xanax recreationally. This then turned into a crutch and I felt like I couldn't leave the house when not on it although to my (rather hazy) knowledge, I never experienced severe withdrawal aside from social anxiety and I was not taking them daily.

Fast forward to now and I am now on 10 mg plus daily of diazepam after making the switch roughly 2 years ago when I realised my Xanax use had became a physical addiction. The reason I switched was less with intent of quitting and more because I could have very aggressive and almost delusional tendencies when on Xanax. With valium I am able to feel normal and people don't notice that I'm on it.  Sometimes I even go 2 days without valium and feel alright but eventually my anxiety takes over, symptoms usually consisting of feeling like im going to have a heart attack with many more on top of this. Its such a real feeling it scares me into taking them again and not sticking out for day 3.

My real question here is with 2 years of frequent diazepam use, pretty much daily up until the last 4 months where I have occasionally sustained for 2 days, am I at risk of seizures or life threatening withdrawals. If I knew for sure that it was all in my head I could fight it out definitely I am strong willed but I am trapped due to the fear of being reclusive and scared to socialise thus losing friends contacts and even failing college. It is this fear that stops me from pushing for the third day. And as I noted earlier I am absolutely terrified of the idea of possible seizures. Really just looking for the blunt truth here, im a young guy and I don't have anyone around me who has been through this to go to for help. What should my next move be, is 2 years too little for me to worry about life threatening withdrawal?.

&#x200B;

Also for reference when I say 10 mg daily this means I am able to take 1 10 mg street valium pill once a day, sometimes every second day, and feel okay (no withdrawal symptoms). On the second day sometimes as it comes up to 48 hours I do begin to get extremely anxious almost like I have been locked in a dark room with no light, just that pressing on the chest feeling it makes me want to run for the valium like a light switch. I suffered from anxiety previous to any bento use which is probably why I fell in love so fast. Sorry if this seems rushed or for any spelling errors im beyond desperate at this point. I have scoured credit but couldn't find any answers on coming off roughly 2 years of diazepam use and what to expect.

&#x200B;

Thanks guys! Peace x

&#x200B;

EDIT: Sorry guys just a quick side note the past few years has really been a blur I want to correct the 2 years daily and say it was closer to a year maybe year and a half. But I have been abusing for about 4 years total. The past year and a half was when it really became a daily thing.",0

The first week after jumping off was full of anxiety and depression, then I felt pretty good for a week and now I am increasingly irritable. Like hair trigger. I have a very kind,  sweet loving husband and I normally treat him the same but almost everything he does makes me crazy right now. Sometimes just his presence. I feel like a horrible wife, he deserves so so so much better than this. I feel like one second I’m apologizing and the next second I’m getting irritated with him again. I’m assuming this is part pregnancy, part PAWS from no  benzo and quarantine does not help. Anxiety always makes me vulnerable to irritability but I just have not been able to control it lately.

Anxiety came at full force and no Antidepressants worked it just made it worse. I was prescribed Klonopin .5mg twice daily and that started working within a week. One month later I was able to function and deal with it but needed to increase to get a more of relief. At the time I didn't know anything about benzos and I had a great doctor he wasn't willing to go up in dosage so took it for 3 years and just lived through ups and downs. I decided to come off and I have within 2 months. I was Klonopin 3 moths free and I couldn't handle it. I went back to my doctor and he put me on 5mg of diazepam in the morning and before sleep. It got better again and then month in build tolerance and same thing. I will say they do work but also at the same time you are so dependant on the drug and it doesn't work like it used to and you don't want to increase dosage because BRAIN will get used to it and just want more of it. 

Today is 3rd day I am starting to taper off cut 5mg pill in 1.25 and my plan is to take 1.25 every 2 weeks and then at 5mg go slower taper. It's hell to go through withdrawals but Anxiety is hell as well which is pretty much all the WITHDRAWALS symptoms. 

My biggest question to put my mind at ease and try to figure out what is best for me? WHEN PEOPLE GOT IN BEZOS did you have really bad anxiety just as you are having while withdrawals or did you have casual Anxiety which could come with death in family etc. and then you got on benzos and now you really developed true anxiety? I would like to know how did you get on Benzo? Thank you and looking forward to people response. This can help many people knowing how it all started.",2

Thankfully, I'm still on a smaller dosage; I only usually take about 0.5mg or 0.75 a day in the evening.  Still, the fact that I'm still taking it disturbs me.  What's hard is the thought of having a panic attack if I can't get sleep.  If I go completely off Xanax, I'm afraid I won't sleep at all leading to a terrible panic attack at night.",2

And the constant anxiety and panic Every single has just built up and now I’m realizing I have trouble doing anything. I should be seeing a psychiatrist and I need to get to the doctor because I’m having problems with my heart and I can’t push myself to make a phone call to get an appointment because I just overthink it. It sucks because even though I know taking a Xanax won’t help me in the long run I can’t shake the thought that if I just take one the uncomfortableness and the panic will go away.

I am 43. Female. I have GAD and depression. My anxiety started this past September with major panic attacks and days filled with fear. I was going through GI problems all summer that caused rapid weight loss and stress. That was the catalyst im sure.
In early October I had a nervous break down and was admitted into a mental hospital for 2 days. It was a horrible experience and made me worse. I started taking .5 Ativan once a day and Zoloft. The Zoloft made my anxiety worse so I stopped it. The Ativan assisted me to be functional and calm. 
I began trying many different antidepressants and they all scared me with their horrible side effects that I kept stopping them. I continued the Ativan because it was consistent.
By December I grew a tolerance and more depression. I never raised my dose though so I dealt with never feeling good. My joy is gone. I stopped driving. I disassociate. I have tremors when I wake up.. So on.
My telehealth doctor had me take a Gene Site test for meds them prescribed me another antidepressant that made me worse. Now I'm back to square one. She doesn't want me to taper off the Ativan until I am stabilized on an antidepressant. She is becoming frustrated with me. I am as well.
My family lives far away. I do not have a lot of friends. I am in a rural area with crappy doctors. I do telehealth counseling which sucks. I am so scared to be alone that I have actually paid people to stay overnight with me.
Today marked my 4th month on Ativan and I want to be off of it. I just do not how to proceed with still having bad depression and anxiety without something. I cannot take beta blockers and Atarax feels like a tranquilizer. Buspar is on my bad list on my Gene test. 
I know the Ativan is worsening my depression. I am really lost and miss my old life badly.
Any recommendations on what I can do for help with my situtation? 
Thank you for taking the time to read all of this!",6

Below is exactly the time and amount of extra: I’m on my cell phone so it’s not showing I’m lost form- not sure how to fix that.

So 6.25 mg extra in 18 days. Either .5 or .75, But as you can see I’ve now done 4 days straight of extra. 

How screwed am I and how do I fix this? Today I tried 1mg and was forcing myself to stick through it because I don’t want to up my dose everyday, but panicked after reading horror stories and felt like I was going to faint around 7pm. I feel I truly messed shit up. And am in unknown territory because I’ve only ever needed an extra once maybe twice a week IF that. I know all about how bad benzos are..I have a scheduled appointment with a new psychiatrist to taper off but that isn’t for two weeks. I really feel this is the only place to ask. 

Should I stabilize at 1.5 everyday and then taper?
Should I suck it up and do 1mg everyday regardless of how I feel. I don’t know how to move forward 

My psychiatrist says I’ll be fine to stay at 1mg but I don’t trust him and he didn’t help me taper when I asked which is why I’m seeing someone new. I’m terrified of withdrawing or having a seizure.

I was considering taking klonopin again since the stress of the pandemic. Well things got really unbearable and I decided it was time to try it. What I have found is that this kind of medication definitely has its place. It is very effective at de-escalating a potentially harmful emotional state. Its very helpful in that regard. I feel like I know where to begin now with myself to take proper action for self-care. I dont wish to take it again, just start being more present with myself.  Pre-pandemic, when I was going to yoga classes, getting outside in the sunshine and being very gentle with myself, it was a much better feeling than what the  klonopin could give me. The Klonopin emotionally blunts me, which is good if the emotion is potentially harmful. Thats why I think these medications have their place, in times of crisis. But taking it day after day and not really knowing why anymore is not effective. Simply because I no longer know why I am taking it anymore, and how it is helping.  The proper action gets lost. That being said, I am no longer afraid of this medication. I understand how it is supposed to be used. Its to de-escalate a harmful state of mind. Then proper care can come into place, such as therapy, exercise, other medications, whatever tools you find helpful in finding peace. There may be some people out there who have had such terrible experiences and circumstances that a daily bezno may be appropriate for them. But it shouldn't be their only support system.  Its about creating a diverse support system, and I can understand how the benzo can help initiate that process, by pulling you our of the traumatic emotional state and being healing. I had come on here a while back looking for advice on this, so now that I have experienced it, I wanted to put it out there in case anyone else may be wondering.  If you are considering taking a benzo again. Be clear with your intention before you take it. Are you taking it to numb out and not deal with how you feel or are you taking it to de-escalate a panicked state so you can begin to address how you feel. I believe the later is how they are intended to be used. There is no reason to fear this drug.  Intentions just need to be made clear on how to use it. Some may never be able to use it, some may be able to use it under times of crisis, and some may have to use it long-term. It really does depend on the individual. In my case, using it again, helped let go of the fear of thinking that I need this medication day in and day out to be okay. I know what I need is to create a support system to manage my stress, mental, emotional, and physical health but also not be  afraid to use a benzo if I need to in a times of crisis. The support system is to help prevent from going into a crisis state,  though I understand that life can be unpredictable and isn't perfect by any means and I may need to lean on this drug once and a while. I dont want to, as I prefer other coping strategies,  but I am no longer afraid to use it if necessary. Thanks for listening. I hope this sheds light on the subject if anyone else has been battling the same concerns.",0

Never thought I would be sober for that long now after years of abuse. I'm trying to have healthful habits like waking up early, do chores and baking something. But last week my parents were concern about my life in such because I do not work or study. So they kinda suggest, a lot, to roll in a college. And I did, but I'm fucking scared.

In the rehab, the counsellors kept telling me that being sober at youth is hard because of all temptations of party's and such. This gave me flashbacks of the other times I tried to stay away from pills and live my life normally but when I got to socialize, meet new people and go to a date, everything went downhill.

I was taking Xanax for 5 years and did a lot of fucked up shit. I didn’t even realize how mean I was to other people until I stopped taking Xanax.

When I was on Xanax I would say whatever without thinking of other people’s feelings etc. 

It feels like a whole different world without Xanax...

I cheated on my exgirlfriend of 4 years multiple times and she still stayed with me. I didn’t even realize how dirty I did her until after Xanax. Now I’m paying a lot of karmic debt and it sucks ass. It’s like living in a more spiritual world now that I’m not taking Xanax. A whole different universe. A universe that other people around me (friends and family) have been living in their whole lives, but I’m so new to it.

I feel like I missed out on a lot of mental growth. Started taking Xanax at 17 and I’m turning 23 now. I realize now a certain amount of anxiety is necessary.

I fucked up my credit, did my ex girlfriend SO DIRTY and karma is biting me in the ass for it. Karma is very real. It catches up to you even if you don’t think it will. NO ONE is safe from it.
I was selling thousands of pills, drugs, robbed a few people at gunpoint, been robbed at gunpoint etc.
I wouldn’t have done any of that if I wasn’t on Xanax.

Started smoking weed when I was 14, I’ve been smoking regularly(every day) since I was 16.

(video in comments)","Somebody very close to me was harmed by benzos, and although not *completely* symptom free today, is living a happy, productive, and healthy life.

What started as something of a coping mechanism to make videos telling her story has evolved into comprehensive record of her journey. She now has hundreds of videos that share her personal pain, her successes, failures, setbacks, windows, waves, and everything between.

She was prescribed ativan without much thought from a doctor, felt awful for about a year, stopped very quickly, and stepped into the gates of hell. She resumed taking it just to taper slowly, and that became a new and painful journey, including (regretfully, in this case) a voluntary 8 week stay in a facility to assist the taper.

She has been off medications of any kind for a long time now.

The videos on this channel document her physical pain, emotions, techniques, people she followed, methods she tried, what worked and what didn't, healthy eating and recipes, emotional work, family challenges - all of it.

I am posting this because I know through her journey having the opportunity to share in the experience with others who have been through the same thing was one of the only things that kept her going. Some people in the ""benzo community"" she had direct contact with... others she just consumed the blogs / videos / posts in various forums - but those connections mattered.

Some videos here should probably come with a trigger warning, as they document deep emotional and physical pain - but I'm hoping what can be seen most is the light at the end of the tunnel. There are happy and triumphant moments as well.

Like I said there are literally hundreds of videos here - but here is the link directly to the story of how the benzos started:

.

To end on a more positive note - here's a video from about 2 years later with a happier story:

The fact that this takes so long is because it's an injury? Heroin withdrawals are generally over in 2 weeks?

But even for an injury... if it is the type of thing that heals why does it take so long? If the body was really capable of healing this type of thing wouldn't it take place a lot faster?

I'm sorry I am not trying to be negative - I am 3 months in and trying to find out the truth about what actually happens after this. From where I can see it is extremely hard to tell if people heal or if they simply learn to get used to and accept their brain working as it does. I want to believe that people who heal up fine simply don't post on forums like these so there is a kind of bias that's easy to miss.

But still... do people get better in 12-18 months or do they just get so used to things that they forget what they felt like before? Why does this take so damn long anyway? Why are our bodies so critically dependent on our brains and nervous systems but it is a broken fingernail that knows how to grow back? 

I can't help but wonder if it is because this - in nature our skin and our muscles and bones are what was vulnerable to damage. Taking man made psychiatric drugs that alter the nervous system does not exist in nature. Poisons exist in nature; but not like this. Have our nervous systems simply not evolved to heal because for the most part you couldn't damage them like this? I don't even know anymore.",2

I drank and took Valium at work just to get by, I work as a hairdresser and felt very vulnerable on the shop floor as I have v low self esteem.
