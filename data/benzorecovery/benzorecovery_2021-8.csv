I was thinking some people in benzo withdrawal get sick from certain supplements,  while others get relief from those same ones.  

Sure we know (for the most part) what the problem is.  But  what's going on in our bodies in an attempt to heal could be completely different.

Wouldn't it be nice to at least habe an idea of where your various neurotransmitters are at?

I mean I don't know how accurate a urine sample is in as a reflection of nerves and cells and activity in the brain.  But at least it's possible to look for possible deficiencies or an abundance , that info could possible help with finding the right supplements for at least some relief.

Hey Team, 

Just thought I’d throw some of my tips out there for when you’re hit with your next wave. 

1: Flow with it - I’ve significantly decreased my waves by just rolling with the punches. When we get a big wave, it’s overwhelming and causes a huge anxiety spike, this anxiety will make the symptoms you experience during that wave 100x worse if you feed it by constantly googling symptoms, staying on forums and focusing hard on the problem. Instead, focus on the fact that you’re one day closer to freedom, go for a walk or have a huge sleep, whatever you feel like doing. Remember, it’s ok to be just do you when this is all happening. 

2: Remind yourself that this will pass and you will not die - When I went through my CT acute withdrawal phase locked in a jail cell in a maximum security jail, I truely thought I was going to die. It’s made me realise that past week 3, the chances are very slim. So, try and stay as positive as you can, call a friend when you feel afraid or talk to your family. This helped me. 

3: Drink lots of water & eats lots of whole foods - For me eating almonds, peanut butter, fruits, veggies and completely cutting out processed foods sped the wave up. 

B out. Love you all.",7,0

 I'm a 33 y/o female have been on Clonazepam since 2015ish. Have been on current dose (1 mg twice a day) for about 4 years. Prescribed by my PCP. She recently had her assistant call me and tell me she was no longer comfortable prescribing it or my Adderall for ADD and then went on a 6 week vacation so I have yet to be able to talk to her. I have been read so many things online and had medical professionals tell me this is negligent and extremely dangerous and I could die (I have a history seizures, read full version for that info). I've heard it can take anywhere from 10 weeks to 10 months to taper cuz it must be done slowly. I talked to a PA who consulted another doctor in the practice. She said she will not go against my PCPs orders but told me to come in on the day I'm set to run out (I just a few days) for an appointment. I want to print and bring in some reputable information regarding safe tapering and maybe other meds that can help withdrawals (I have already purchased a few of the most suggested supplements/vitamins for withdrawal). I was told by a friend who is educated in neurology that given my history and this type of medication, it's extremely negligent and that primary care docs are often very uninformed about just how dangerous it is. So I would like to share information regarding tapering/withdrawal after long-term therapeutic use (I never abused it. Most I ever did was take an extra half if I absolutely needed it and even that was rare). And links/info would be greatly appreciated. 


Backstory/More Details:


 Started off 1mg a day as needed for anxiety/panic attacks related to PTSD. Started having (or at least realizing I was having) partial seizures in 2017. They were mostly focal seizures where I'd stare off, but lose time and wasn't aware. My husband would say my name and I didn't hear it. Only lasted about a minute at most. Then I started having them with body spasms (not full body, but like an arm or leg jumping repeatedly and again, I was in an ictal state... didn't know what was happening). And I guess it happened and I fell down the steps in my house that went into our den area. My husband found me unconconcious. And even though it was only a couple minutes, we went to the ER. I had 2 seizures while I was there, one the doctor saw so he could confirm it was a seizure and he admitted me. I did the 3 day test where they hook wires up to your head and have a camera that's triggered by the brain waves seizures cause.

 I followed up with a neurologist, had an MRI, and he didn't see anything that was for sure suspicious. But we talked and realized my seizures seemed linked to stress for me. And since I was already on Clonazepam, he wanted to try upping the dose and have me on it daily. So I took 1 mg twice a day. He said that was fairly low for seizures and we could go up of needed. That seemed to work out well so I never went up and he just had my primary write it since she was already writing my Clonazepam. And I have been on that dose ever since. Never needed to go back to the neuro because my seizures didn't come back. 

 Well my primary has recently just been ruder than usual during our virtual visits. I just started Adderall via a psych but their service was no longer available in my state so I asked my PCP to take over and she agreed. She told me on our last visit I was gonna become addicted to Adderall, that it's a horrible drug. Even though it has improved my life greatly and I am very cautious as I have lost family members to addiction. She told me I looked sickly and asked me how much weight I've lost. I told her none. I'm the same weight I've been since I leveled out after weight loss surgery. (And before I had it, she had me Phentermine for over a year straight... but Adderall is gonna make me an addict 🙄) But she refilled my meds and that was that. 

 And then, as I mentioned, her assistant called me and said my doctor no longer felt comfortable prescribing either med. So I'm going to be going through withdrawal from 2 meda at once. Though I have only been on Adderall for a few months so it shouldn't be as bad... I hope. 

 But not only did I have seizures prior to treatment, I once tried to wean off Clonazepam myself over 3 weeks... I just was feeling shitty about the idea of being physically dependent on a medication. Then right at the end, I had the worst seizure of my life. Grand mal. Huge gash in my head. Husband called 911. Very little memory of those 48 hours. I remember EMTs lifting me off my bedroom floor, moments in the hospital. I voluntarily saw their psych, we decided it was best for me to stay on it. Life went back to normal after I healed. 

 So I am scared of that happening again or possibly worse. And I have 3 kids, ages 9, 2, and 8 months. My oldest is in school and husband works long hours as a store manager. I'm deathly afraid of my kids witnessing a grand mal seizure or even death. (My mom died when I was 18, I found her body, I still have that image burned into my brain. I don't want my kids to experience that sort of trauma.) Everyone I've talked to in the office has been so cold and won't give me any answers or advice. My husband has to take off work because the other Dr is requiring an in person visit and probably a drug test (which is fine, I have nothing to hide) and no kids allowed because of COVID. I don't expect her to just keep prescribing the meds, but I am hoping (it's all I have...) that she'll come up with a safe plan for me. And I don't know how much she knows about tapering off of Clonazepam, which I've read is a bit more complicated that some benzos. So I'm hoping if I can show this doctor some articles/studies written by reputable sources, she will see the danger and help me be as safe as possible.

 Thanks in advance if you read all this and can help or share any advice/information if you've been through Clonazepam withdrawal.

My jump dose was 0.030mg. Highest dose was 1.0mg (prescribed). But my most frequent dose was 0.25, which I had been taking since early 2019. Trying to get off that last 0.25 has been the absolute hardest thing I've had to do. 

Symptoms during this last phase of my taper have been: **insomnia** (like 3-4 hours a night of broken sleep, most of the time), **muscle jerks** in my legs and feet at night (contributing to the insomnia), **POTS** (but not nearly as bad as it used to be), **24/7 jaw tremor, tinnitus / ringing in brain, eye floaters, hand tremors**. 

Mentally, though, I feel like myself. Actually, I feel like a much better self now than I did before. I was hit with several weeks of intense chemical depression back in February when I was somewhere around 0.20. Once that lifted, I started feeling worlds better. I have much less anxiety, and significantly more creativity and motivation.

Not gonna lie, I am scared of new symptoms popping up, or going back to old symptoms I had last summer when I tried to do a 50% cut. I wound up in bed for 2 months due to physical symptoms, mostly tachycardia and nerve pain. I'm trying to stay positive and hopefully stay on my feet this time around.

Added:  ADHD drugs may act as partial dopamine agonists.  Don't believe everything you read or see on the internet, but I found this link that shows the symptoms of both high and low dopamine.  The graphic doesn't really show the differences between high and low, you gotta read the link.

https://trackmystack.com/articles/6-symptoms-low-dopamine/

However really low dopamine has also been linked to szitophrenia... so this seems like a big risk. 

Ill talk to my doctor..  he is actually one of the few doctors that understands drug , especially benzo withdrawal.  If he thinks it's a good idea, and I try it I will report my results.

Thank you all, i hope you are all feeling well today and making progress toward healing.

  ---Original post---
This idea is based on a friend of mine who took Ativan and vyvanse at high doses for years, and had almost no problem coming off 5 mg of ativan. Orignaly prescribed vyvanse for adhd but couldn't sleep so Ativan was added. Over the years the doses of both increased 
He cold turkeyed 70mg of Vyvanse (because it wasn't working anymore) he then tapered the 5mg of Ativan in like 12 weeks and had no real issues with withdrawal 
Thoughts?

It's probably  a horrible idea for those in WD or already tappering, like I mentioned my friend started those meds at about the same time.. 
I would imagine it would initially increase anxiety and insomnia.  But just in theory... if a person were to use an ADHD medication starting at a very low dose (like half of a starter dose) and maintained that use until tolerance set in then updose a few times to hit higher tolerance, then suddenly colt turkey the stimulant. It seems like your be left with some depression from the dow regulated dopamine,  but... the glutamate receptors would have bee pruned back just like gaba receptors are with benzos... again... this is all just speculation...  But, Isn't it possible glutamate receptors would become dysfunctional after repeated agonist action? much like gaba receptors?  

If someone were to then cold turkey the stimulant it would seem at least possible that the effect could be a more even balance between glutamate and gaba activity in benzo damaged brains.  

I know the idea sounds bad. Causing drug induced  brain damage to help ease the symptoms of drug Induced brain damage. 

The theory is based around patience and low daily dosing to avoid siezure or severe damage..  and the idea that brains do heal themselves so eventually both gaba and glutamate receptors would be healing , but without the constant debilitating withdrawal symptoms of benzo WD.

I've read many reports that tolerance to ADHD meds happens about as fast as tolerance to benzos, that's why they are always updosing every few months.

If you look at the symptoms of VyVanse WD for those with clinical ADHD you see anxiety. (Not good for benzo people)  however, and again I'm totaly guessing,  people with  ADHD do respond opposite to stimulants than a normal person does. 

The most interesting thing I found over and over was Sleepiness: Most people report feeling especially tired and sleepy You may sleep excessively (i.e. hypersomnia) until your body and brain regain energy.

But VyVanse is a pretty harcore drug the #1 symptom of overdose is siezure and possible death.  So if anyone undertook this approach it would habe to be done very carefully and through medical supervision I would imagine",1,0

I need help stopping now.,"Over summer I serverly overestimated my self control when I acquired clonazolam. Over the course of the last 7 weeks I've used anywhere from 0.250mg to 1.5mg of clonazolam daily. At the 1 month mark I took an 8 day break and anxiety was bad enough after about 3 days I used a single .250mg diclazepam dose and that was enough to get by the remaining 5 days. I have an anxiety issue, which is why I started in the first place, which probably amplified any withdrawals. Just had a really bad fear of seizing after reading so many horror stories otherwise I probably would have just pushed through the anxiety without dosing diclazepam.

Picked up again after the week hiatus and have been using approximately 0.750mg to 1.5mg daily over the last 3 weeks. (Although I think real doses may be lower because supplier has a reputation of underdosing). 

Basically I started to see the metaphorical writing on the walls of where continuing this trend would lead me and I want out.

Where do I start? If I was able to get through a week before do you think I can go mostly CT again and only use a single dose of diclazepam when anxiety becomes unbearable (maybe every 3 days I'd guess if I had to extrapolate my last experience). Or do I absolutely have to taper. My naive thinking is leading me to believe I can ""CT"" and use small, imperceptible doses of diclazepam as needed. 

Remaining in my stash I have about 35mg clonazolam, 10mg diclazepam, and 20mg flubromazolam. Also have some phenibut capsules that have been sitting for about a year because they never gave me any noticable effect. Can get more clonaz or flubro if needed but what I have left of diclaz is all there is.

Really not sure how to proceed and would like some advice. I have my final year of university starting next week and I *absolutely* cannot afford to fuck this year up, covid already delayed me by a year when it first hit. My schedule is 12 credits each semester so hopefully will be managable.

 Really hoping that after 2 months I'm not in too deep to get out without some damage.

I took the first dose of seroquel last night. Within 30 minutes of taking that medicine, I was sweating quite a bit and became nauseated. I was awake for approximately 2.5 hours after taking that dose, which is much longer than what is typical for me. I woke up just prior to 4am.

I typically have adverse/opposite reactions to most ""mood altering"" medications and even alcohol. In the past, I have been treated with multiple anti depressants which negatively impacted me physically, emotionally, and mentally.

I plan on continuing my established micro taper of klonopin, which is currently at ~0.125mg each evening. I will likely hold that dose until my sleep stabilizes and I will then make another 10% taper reduction. 

I sent a longer and more detailed message to my doctor earlier this morning so we'll see what he says but just damn. I really needed a good night's rest and the seroquel made my sleep worse. I am pretty bummed and have a banging headache this morning. 

Have any of you heard of this reaction to seroquel? I was hoping I would have gotten at least one night's rest but now I'm more fatigued and stressed than I was before 😔",3,0

Since my last cut two weeks ago, I have been consistently waking up between 3-4am and have had no appetite, no energy, some pretty decent social anxiety, and panic attacks with heart palpitations. I discussed this with my doctor today. He is concerned these withdrawal symptoms will be ongoing due to interdose withdrawals and the lack of sleep is exacerbating my issues. 

He has prescribed me 25mg Seroquel to take each evening and is advising me to make the jump one or two days after I fill the new Seroquel script. I am to take the Seroquel each night for sleep for two weeks and then return to his office to evaluate the situation.

I used pressed Xanax (believed to be about 2.5mg each) for about 5-6 weeks, almost everyday. I would use about 2 or 3 pills a day, sometimes binge them.

Between the 5th and 6th week I did try to stop cold turkey. I didn't realize my anxiety was so much higher than normal for the first day, and then by Night 2, I had a feeling of terror, rapid heartbeat, burning veins (felt very dehydrated even though I'd been drinking water all day), muscle twitches, and insomnia.

Since then (still on Week 6), I've been taking as little as I can at a time to take the symptoms away. It seemed to be about 3 pills total over a day would take the symptoms entirely away, though the total I was able to take dwindled as did my supply.

I ran out of Xanax the day before yesterday. Yesterday, I got ahold of 9x pressed Valium (believed to be about 10mg each) off the street. I did take a very tiny amount at first, then a half to confirm the potency wasn't more than advertised. I took about 25mg in the morning, 30mg in the afternoon, and then 30mg at night, for a total of 85mg. I did drink some grapefruit soda with this and it seems like I'm not still not in withdrawal this morning. Not sure what happened to the last half, I assume I took it sometime yesterday as it's nowhere to be found.

Tomorrow, I have a psychiatry appointment at 3pm, but no benzos today.

Will the Valium I took yesterday keep the withdrawal away today? I am also worried about how the psychiatrist will respond. I haven't heard of a certain protocol for tapering from heavy, short-term use. I am also not sure if the doctor will prescribe Xanax or Valium or both. I was hoping for a clean switch to prescription Valium for tapering, but I realize there is no way I am getting anywhere close to 80mg a day.",3,0

In total I did bout 60mg, but some days I may have binged and taken 6mg and others less. On some days I also took Clonazepam, but only on 3 or 4 of the days and it was in a low dose. This was my first time doing benzos and I was clearly Naive to their power.

I was told that I hadn't taken them long enough to get withdrawals, and that tapering from such a short period would only increase my risk of dependence, so I stopped pretty abruptly. I went from 3-4mg a day on average down to 0,5mg without feeling too bad, did 0,5 for 3 days, and decided that If i could do the jump from 3-4mg to 0,5mg, I could stop altogether. I've now not taken any since saturday and I'm definitely feeling physical withdrawal symptoms. My head aches in this ''trying to figure out an equation that I can't'' kind of way almost constantly, I feel like I'm dissociated, my coordination is way off, and I can get slightly nauseous.

Some people told me withdrawal would last a couple days, others say it can last weeks. Some even say I should not have cold turkeyed and I'm at risk of PAWS.

So my questions are:

1. PAWS is out of the question right? There's no way I took it for long enough to experience PAWS later on, right?
2. How long can I expect to experience these acute withdrawal symptoms? I thought they'd have gone by now and it's quite unsettling that some literature says it can last a month. I need my brain back.

If anyone could give me some guidance that would be great. I've heard such mixed opinions, someone even said I should re-dose to ease the withdrawals, but I really don't want to unless I'm actually at risk of PAWS. I just want to get through this ASAP.

Hi Guys, 

I wanted to make a post just to help some of y it with what’s worked for me during my recovery (I’m still recovering) but it’s getting much easier. I’ve been severely struggling with DPDR 24/7 since CT and still have it daily 24/7 though it’s subsiding and the severity of it is no where near as bad. I know I’m healing. 

1: Establish a health sleeping pattern, this is so important. Your body is exhausted, your brain is so out of sync. Try and sleep at the same time every night and get up the same time every morning. 

2: Hydrate, try to drink as much water as possible up to 3litres per day. 

3: Cut our all sugar and caffeine, natural sugars are fine though processed foods, you don’t need the extra stimulation at this point in life. You’re body needs whole natural foods. 

4: Get outside and walk or run for as long as you can, I probably walk 15,000 steps a day at this point because being out in nature is healing within itself. I wouldn’t be this far in my recovery without it. 

5: Meditate or Pray (whichever works for you or you believe in). I pray daily and the changes I’ve noticed are absolutely unbelievable. 

6: Listen to Binaural Beats before bed, it’s really calming and works for me. 

7: Get a psychologist, preferably clinical. Most of us are struggling severely with anxiety from this experience. It helps a lot to talk to a professional. 

8: Remind yourself you aren’t going to die, it can feel this way though past 2/3 weeks if you haven’t tapered you won’t seizure. 

9: Speak to friends and family, it’s so important to vocalise these struggles. 

Love you all. Keep going.",12,0

I’ve been working on tapering for a couple weeks and for the last week I’ve been taking .5mg twice a day with very little/no anxiety. I’ve only been on kpins for about 3 months in total, and I’ve only been using them daily for about one month. What kind of side effects should I expect if I stop cold turkey at this dose? Should I continue tapering until I’m comfortable with .5mg a day, and then make the jump to cold turkey? I’m mainly concerned about seizures as I’ve gone through them before with Xanax withdrawal a couple of years ago. My Xanax abuse was far worse than my kpin use has been though, and I didn’t even attempt to taper off of about 4-6mg a day of Xanax before going cold turkey. I also still have almost a full bottle of Keppra 500mg (an anticonvulsant) that I was prescribed a couple of years ago when I had my seizure from Xanax, so I could potentially use that to prevent seizures. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as im really trying to get off these kpins. Thanks!

I am 29, and 5 months pregnant. 

I have been on prescribed Xanax(alprazolam) for 10 years. I got up to .25 mg 4x a day. It came to a point where I knew I needed to increase again because I could feel it wasn't doing much for me at the current dosage. I decided it was probably time for me to wean off. I tried to talk to my psychiatrist. He is 82, and as I've learned, believes what he believes and that's that. He said if I wanted to get off, I should just get off it. That Xanax isn't addictive below 4mg. I was gobsmacked. But I knew I needed to wean from reading the stories here, so I said no I would stay on, to at least give myself time to start cutting without going cold turkey. 

Unfortunately, where I am, it is very hard to find this kind of doctor, and it is very expensive. So switching doctors is not optional. I wish I could. 

So here is the problem. I have gotten down from .25 mg 4x a day, to 1 .25mg pill that I cut in half and take half in the morning and half at night. I have been sustained on this dose for almost 2 months. I need to finish cutting down and I'd like to do so as safely and as soon as possible for my baby girl. 

Please help me do this. It really would mean the world to me. I have tried to look at this ashiton Manuel that I see frequently messaged here, but I admit it is hard for me to understand. Please tell me your advice. Thank you so much my friends and I wish you all good luck on your own journey <3",17,0

The list goes on and on. I feel like I’ve been to the dark side. To an alternate universe of hell where everything, including life and reality itself is terrifying. I’m so scared sometimes that I’ll never be the same person, who now seems actually quite naive and innocent, because she didn’t know this kind of torturous suffering existed. 

For example, sometimes before this, lights would bother me a little bit but not in a scared way just in an uncomfortable way sometimes my sight would feel funny.

So glad I found this space, you're all so supportive of each other.

I should preface this with that I don't feel as though I am addicted \*yet\* to Diazepam, but I can see the path I'm walking down and want to stop before it develops into something worse, but I'm keen to hear some opinions and advice.

&#x200B;

Looking at the posts on here, I'm using a fairly low dose of Diazepam.

I have GAD and panic disorder and have always had a batch of Diazepam 5mg tablets (usually 14 or 28 at a time) to take as needed. Typically these would last me 2-3 months, but I've found that in the last month I've already gone through 14 5mg tablets - I only take them when I feel I can't control the anxiety attacks OR in preparation for an anxiety-inducing event. (I went away with some friends and used at least 1 tablet each of the four days I was away for.)  


Anyway, I'm worried about the frequency I'm using them now - I can usually go one or two days before the panic gets bad enough that I need one to calm down, but that feels as though it's taking me down the wrong road. I've not taken more than 5mg in a day beyond the recent weekend away I mentioned.

I'm also horrendously emetophobic and the thought of withdrawals involving that are killing me.

Is stopping cold turkey based on my frequency and strength of use likely to cause me any problems?

&#x200B;

I should mention that there have been several pockets of time where I've not had any for 1-2 weeks with no problems, but something (dental visit or panic attack) would make me reach for another tablet.

Yesterday I basically the entire day I was getting massive waves of panic attacks and I ended up taking some more valium (which now adds up to 240mg total since Monday) and I managed to sleep 3.5 hours because of that.

I’ve fucked up especially with presses and taken them a couple too many days in a row and had to learn my lesson with rebound anxiety and prob light withdrawal a few times since then. Usually scares me off for a while and after my first and last bout with clonozolam I decided I’m def not fucking with no RCs cuz flualp is bad enough, fuck all that dirty shit.

Well I found myself back on kratom too and as I’m tapering off I decided to get about 20 MG’s worth of 1 mg pharma footballs. I took like 6 over a few weeks and noticed no damn rebound and put that in the back of my brain. 

Well fast forward to last week. Around Wednesday I decided since I’m ripping so much on my kratom taper I can aid w alp for a few nights and be done by the weekend. Come Friday morning I had a pretty serious confrontation and some shit heads tried lying on me and getting me locked up among other things, a lot of commotion I’m not used to at this point. that led to me having a terrible fuckin panic attack that *maybe* could have warranted a half a football if even that but you know how the addict mind works. 

I took all the rest of my xans (16 mg) and 3 of my 1 mg klonopins I had stashed in 4 days, Wednesday to Saturday. Haven’t taken anything since but have felt like fucking shit since, at first I chalked it up to rebound but I’ve been able to sleep somewhat decent..I honestly can’t tell if it’s from cutting kratom so much, taking all of those benzos (7 days ago now so..idk) or what the fuck but I am having all kinds of back spasms, anxiety bouts of depression hot and cold and most importantly pain all in my neck and back and shoulders and everywhere else around there.

Anybody have any advice on anything that it could be or any potential help on feeling a little better? I have magnesium glycinate I take every night, l theanine that I’m on and off and some ashwagandha that I took for a couple nights and wasnt sure if it’s the culprit extended my discomfort from rebound. As well as some gabapentin I’ve been holding for when I jump kratom, as I don’t like mixing them. This could honestly be all kratom for all I know but I still take a little and feel not much better so I can’t call it",2,0

When i was on those all i did was look up to rappers and think i could live that unhealthy lifestyle like them and just really had a totally different mindset than i do now i use to sit in my room all day listenin to rap music videos and going thru instagram now i wanna avoid being in my room as much as i can. I take rides to anywhere now just to get out the house and i cant tell you how good it feels just to not be in the house all day even if its one quick ride i dont think I’m 100% clear of all wd side effects still get ears ringing here and there but really only happens when i think of how i used to be and sit in my head about it. My bad wds honestly went away by about 2 months, but still have high anxiety but has gotten better as time has passed,I had to quit smoking weed right around when i jumped off because it was way different not on those pills all it does is make me extremely paranoid and even sometimes catch panic attacks and i never got those before but totally different high then before, i used to enjoy it alot now it is such a uncomfortable high and i smoked heavily for 8 years straight lol. But I remember being on here all the time so scared to jump off seeing the horror stories and i just want everyone struggling with this addiction to know that you will get thru it you just need to do it for yourself and be determined to get off. I always wanted off just wasn’t ready and was very scared then one week i just said i can’t do it anymore and had alot of guilt built up hiding my addiction from everyone and found someone to talk to on here and they really helped me out to get through it. Best advice is to find someone on here that has gotten thru this and ask them there story on how they got off and how you should go about getting off because it can be a big help. I hope everyone stays safe and gets away from this devil drug!",19,0
103,2021-08-20 18:34:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/p8fkp2/2_month_clonazepam_started_taper/,"2 month clonazepam, started taper","I was given a .5 clonazepam twice a day script from family doctor that I was on for 8 weeks until I could see a psychiatrist.  I did drink on it the first couple weeks as the 1mg wasn’t helping to much and I was coming off a month of zero sleep and level 9 anxiety.  Haven’t had a drink in 4-6 weeks and will not drink while tapering either.  I learned my lesson there after getting really weird sensation after I had two beers on it, not calming, the opposite!

Anyways, I told psych I wanted to start a taper immediately from this 1mg a day dosage as this drug is scarring the hell out of me and is driving my anxiety.  All my anxiety is focused on this drug and the forth coming taper.

Any ways, I’m two weeks into taper, down to  .625 a day dosage.  Holding this until next week which would be three weeks of tapering next Thursday.  I’ve done drops of .125 three times.  The first was for three or four days, second drop was for about 6 days.  First two drops had mild sleep disruption that night, everything seemed okay otherwise .  I was feeling hopeful I could do this with minor setbacks after the first two drops.  Still averaging about 6 hours of broken sleep.  Same as it was while on whole dosage.  

I’ve been more anxious this week after last drop, but not catastrophic.  That drop was a little harder than the first two.

Any words of wisdom to help take my anxiety off of this process?

My anxiety drives me to find comparable experiences that have positive outcomes and has made me feel worse this week.  

Any other advice appreciated!",3,0

Do I need to increase my dose to stabilize?,"I feel like I literally can't go on like this. I've tapered down from 2mg clonazepam to .75mg over the past couple of years. My drops have been sporadic, when I'm feeling good and stable.

My only symptom right now is utter hopelessness, dysphoria, and a lack of will to continue. I've never been this depressed in my entire life.

I haven't made any drops in the past few months, so I don't know why this is happening, but I've been in this state for a couple of weeks now. I simply can't continue. I feel like I need to regroup from a place of stability before I can continue my recovery. It sounds morbid, but the only other relief I can think of is death, so I feel like stabilizing at maybe 1mg is probably a better option.

Has anyone else had to go up in dose a bit after failing to cope with hopelessness during their taper? Were you able to successfully taper afterwards?

Please help and share your advice and experiences. I'm at the end of my rope.

Edit: in case anyone stumbles across this thread in the future (seems to happen a fair amount on this sub). I pushed through the pain, learned to live with it, and built good habits. I think it's been nearly 6 weeks since I posted this, and I'm now down to .5mg and I'm generally not doing any worse. In fact, I've had many days that were not so bad at all. My advice to anyone who wants to updose: try to change some other things first, and keep reminding yourself that you will feel normal again until those new habits provide some relief.

Edit 2: Again, for anyone who stumbles across this post in the future, I wanted to post another update. It's been about 4 months since that original post, and about 2 months since that last edit. I'm now at 0.12mg. I'll be jumping completely off the meds next month. Things are generally the same as they were a couple months ago. Not pleasant, but certainly manageable. I'm so glad I went ahead with the taper instead of trying to stabilize. I'll try to update when I'm fully off, but things are looking up!

Edit 3: thought I should post another update. 5 months since original post, and about a month since the last edit. Down to .03mg and about to discontinue entirely. Things have gotten pretty rough, and I think my taper was a bit quick and is catching up to me. Not really much I can do about it now because I'm not going to updose or reinstate. Still going to jump off the meds soon because my dose is so small. I'll try to deal with the symptoms as they come because what else can I do? I'll post another update when I'm through the acute phase and things start to improve again. I doubt anyone is ever gonna read this lol but I figure if just one person does it could be helpful. Helpful piece of advice: in this process, you're never actually at the end of your rope. You do find a way to continue, and change is inevitable. When you can't possibly get any lower, that change has to be for the better!

Edit 4: I think it's been about 6 months since the original post now. I've been off the meds for 3 weeks now. It's been very up and down. The lowest lows are intense, but don't last more than a couple hours. I have moments where I feel about 70% my normal self. Those also last a couple hours at a time. Things look pretty promising, but it's a very bumpy road to the finish line. Again, I'd be surprised if anyone even sees this, but I know I've read plenty of old posts, so it's possible. If nothing else, it can act as a progress log for myself.",4,0

The other day I had a telemedicine appointment with my doctor on how my tapering was going.  I discussed my symptoms (depression, anxiety, general misery, etc). Lol.  My doctor said I was having withdrawal symptoms because my cutting and weighing was giving me irregular dosages and causing symptoms.  She said I would have been better off breaking my tablets in half as she initially recommended. 😳  I can’t believe she thinks this is an acceptable taper.  Now I’m really suspicious of her care.  

So- she said she’d been thinking about it and thought a longer acting benzo would help me.  (DUH!).  She initially refused my request for a diazepam taper.  I now have a prescription for .25 mg clonazepan to be taken once per day.  I’m to stay on it for 30 days and then we will begin tapering - so she said.

I took my first pill yesterday and don’t feel that great.  In fact, I feel awful. Maybe I expected too much.  The pill is extremely tiny and I can’t imagine cutting it, though there is a smaller .125 mg pill, which she will probably prescribe next month. There is no scoring on the pill and it is dissolvable by mouth.  My thoughts are that this change has set me back a couple of months.  I have plenty of alprazolam - about 100 (.5 mg) tablets and 120 (.25 mg) tablets.  

I’m worried that I will be unable to satisfactorily taper this .25 mg Clonazepan dose. I’m already imagining that she will have me reduce from .25 mg directly to .125 and then jump.   My doctor is against Valium/diazepam.  I’m considering returning to alprazolam tomorrow (I took my Clonazepan today) and proceed with my micro cutting and gel capsules as I had been doing.  

I suppose at some point I should have faith in my doctor, but this doesn’t sound too good or promising. 

Im not feeling that great (extremely depressed). As I said, I’m considering going back to my alprazolam taper.  Any thoughts or advice appreciated.",1,0

Cliffs up top, whole story to follow... Any insight would be great though. Looking for help with what I should do now. My psych Isn't the greatest and didn't seem like he took my claim of physical dependence seriously in my last meeting. I also have a bad GP who is out of the office all summer.,, so I'm not sure what kind of doctor I should speak with. Should I go to the ER/urgent care ASAP? Is there another go-to for this sort of thing? Should I just continue to take low dose clonazepam and function normally? -- onto the details.   


CLIFFS:  
\- Have been taking low dose benzos (as prescribed) for about 4 years. This was .5-.75mg 2-3x a week tops (I'm a 200lb, semi active, 6 foot male fwiw)  
\- April 2021 I decide to quit cold turkey due to possibly being too reliant on them. Make it 4 weeks (of absolute hellish side effects) until a massive panic attack forced me to take 1mg k-pin to calm down and forego an ambulance trip to the ER  
\- Try again in June, July, and August and basically have the same result, making its about 2-3 weeks before a massive panic attack, which feels like a medical emergency, sets me back and I take a K-pin to help  
\- It happened again tonight, so looking for insight on what to do, as my way has not worked... as far as quitting, or speaking with medical professionals etc. Thanks so much in advance.   


Main detailed info:

I dealt with terrible anxiety/depression/depersonalization for years with no medication and 4 years ago I finally see a psychiatrist. He tries me on the usual run of SSRIs/SNRIs (which have never worked for me, Iv'e tried practically all of them at this point) and xanax .25mg as needed for acute panic attacks... The xanax was the only thing that seemed to help, I would take it maybe 2-3x a week, sometimes less, always being cognizant to only use them as needed, since I knew the addiction potential. I never ""got high"" on them and to this day I've never taken more than 1mg in a day. I thought this was a very low risk plan.   


Fast forward to 18 months ago I get a new Psych. He decides to switch me to Clonazepam .5mg, and the usual try every SSRI/SNRI (which still never work for me)....again, the K-pins work wonders, I may even prefer them to xanax, the only downside being the longer onset period. I feel ""normal"" when I take just .5-.75mg. Not high, not goofy, just how I remember feeling years ago before any of this shit started -- Clear headed, confident, just myself.   


A few months ago however I realize I was starting to take it a bit more frequently, and more preemptively rather than in response to a panic attack, especially because K-pin seems to take close to 1.5 hours to kick in. I realize perhaps I'm getting more dependent on them than I feel comfortable with, which I have always tried to be careful of, so I quit cold turkey in April. I thought my low dose/frequency would make this fine. I made it 4 weeks, but it was hell. I had headaches, vertigo, no strength, brain fog, vision disturbances, depression, terrible insomnia, no energy, etc etc. Basically I wasn't able to leave my house and could barely function. On the 4th week I had a massive panic attack, which felt like a medical emergency. Closest I've ever been to calling 911. I decide not to, but to take 1mg k-pin. Within an hour I feel ok again, so pretty much confirming its all been withdrawal/anxiety symptoms right?  


In May I decide to take them as usual, so about 2-3x a week, and June I try to quit again. This time I make it 2 weeks. Same symptoms kick in after a few days and similar ending. Level 10 panic attack where I need to take k-pin. Try again in July, make it 3 weeks. Ends the same way. Now, today was day 9 of my most recent time and it happened again, it has been just miserable. It seems to get worse as the days go by rather than better. I would have thought the first week was the hardest but in my experience it seems to get worse after the first week.   


I'm at a loss of what to do. My psych has prescribed me Propanolol PRN (for the high heart rate/trembling/sweating) and Trazadone nightly (to help with the insomnia). These seem to help a bit, but I'm still really suffering with what I assume are the benzo withdrawal symptoms. While I was never a huge user of them, I have used them for a long time so it seem my body has indeed developed a dependency. Do any of you have similar experiences? Tips to push over the hump? Does it truly get better eventually? Sorry for the novel but Im just coming down for a massive panic attack and wanted to write this out while it was fresh, so maybe I can get some internet help, or at least have it as a record to relay this info to my docs.

I found this study claiming Taurine inhibits benzodiazepine binding, and it all makes sense now, but why have I never heard of this before? Am I interpreting it wrong? It sounds like Taurine can act like a “Suboxone” or “Naloxone” for benzos but everyone on this sub praises it. Why?

So I go to a shrink and they keep me on 4mg valium a day, I tell them I am in benzo wd, and they tell me I'm bipolar (may or may not be true), and give me atypical antipsychotics. Didn't like them.

Fast forward a year and a half later I am on 20-30mg of etizolam a day and out of control. I go into treatment and have the craziest withdrawals I can imagine. They gave me tons of barbiturates and gabapentin/lyrica so really it was more mental than anything but I basically felt like I was on LSD for about 3 months.

Ok so I've been clean from benzos since the end of October 2020. I am doing ok, pretty much back to normal (and regretful of how stupid I was), but I have some TERRIBLE ringing in my ears. I even took a few 5mg valium one time, and my ears still ring.

I started on 2mg of clonazepam and 2mg of alprazolam in 2018. 

Beginning in summer 2020 I began tapering after experiencing 5 weeks of acute withdrawal caused by taking a massive (30-40mg) dose of clon and alp. The reason I took such a large dose was to try to ease an opiate detox. Big mistake. As I said this massive dose caused an extreme rebound-withdrawal that lasted about 5 weeks, with all of the classics symptoms. A complete nightmare. 

Throughout that experience I was trying to stabilize at 2mg of clonazepam. At 6 weeks i Became stable and the symptoms basically faded. I felt normal. Needless to
say I was relieved.

That experience made me want to get off clonazepam, so I began tapering shortly after that. Like I said, I started at 2mg, and from there cut by .25 at one month intervals. When I reached .25mg/day, I cut to .125, which I am now trying to take once every two days. 

So far, I have experienced very mild symptoms. Mostly slightly disturbed sleep and increased anxiety and sensitive emotions. 

I am wondering if anyone has an opinion about what to do. I know that the taper can be extremely difficult for some people, so I am grateful that I managed to escape the worst of it. 

I am concerned about dropping completely, but my taper has been mild and my dose is currently quite low. Should I continue to taper lower for longer? Does anyone have experience with a mild taper followed by a mild final jump? Is an easy taper an indication that the jump should also be easy?

My last dose was 48 hours ago, .125mg. So far, only a slight increase in nervousness and anxiety. 

Thanks for any advice or insight!

TL, DR; does an easy taper to a low dose (.125mg/48hours) mean an easy final jump? Should I continue to taper for longer? Start dose 2mgpd clonazepam; taper 10 months; current dose .125mg/48hrs.

I've posted before, but that was at the beginning of my CT journey from ativan. 

Background: went from as needed to twice a day (0.5 mg each dose) for almost 3 months via my doc for uncontrolled anxiety after responding poorly to a few SSRIs. Took it due to a bunch of life stressors and horrible driving anxiety. 

So, today is day 21 no meds. My driving anxiety has returned with it, but it's partially because of the side effects I am feeling. 

I'm still dealing with random head pressure, surges in adrenaline, headaches, anxiety, waking up jittery/anxious, feeling exhausted by 4 or 5 pm, twitching, feeling like I need to twitch but don't, etc. 

For those that took it for a shorter period of time, is this normal? 

When I take meds like Pepcid or my asthma inhaler it makes things worse for a bit then it chills out. 

The other day I got a horrible headache and twitches after eating french fries. 

Everything just seems over the top right now when I have bad moments. The good stretches are getting longer. 

It also feels like my brain just wants to quit working when I'm doing tasks. 

This is all so odd. 

I accidentally went CT and then my doc informed me he would have tapered me if I came to him first. Because I took this before as needed (not super often) I just thought it was biz as usual until I called and asked, but I was already about 3 days in.",2,0

After reading so much literature on how hard it is to complete a taper and withdrawal, and all the spooky stuff about how some people just don't make it and end up on benzos for life (or worse, dead), I'm truly convinced that they just hadn't heard enough success stories from folks who kicked benzos and are living happy lives now.

My vices are gabaergics, adderall/vyvanse, and for a decade, marijuana. I’ll use those will little control. That leads me to my current pickle. I bought a 250g tub phenibut because I was scared of pregabalin withdrawals from a short binge. Instead, I tapered my remaining pregabalin and left the phenibut unopened, not wanting to explore getting Baclofen later if I couldn’t taper phenibut by itself. That was a good decision. Keeping the tub after I was done? Bad.

I opened it months later, increased to a short daily binge and it was empty, rapidly tapered in another week, and bit my first phenibut CT bullet. I knew sleep would be hard because the insomnia following just rebound single or twice a week usage was bad. I ordered clonazolam and ran through 10mg in six days to sleep through CT WD.

I didn’t sleep after I last used it on Wednesday until Sunday afternoon. Three days after stopping, my seemingly phenibut WDs peaked. Coldness and temperature control issues are replaced with intense neuropathy pain, primarily in my ankles and feet.

Without clam, I drank wine before bed (and only then) to try to sleep. It wasn’t until I drank enough Sunday that it worked. I would say Sunday was the only day I was drunk or had a decent buzz. After sleeping for an hour, I woke up and noticed the pain in my legs was lessened. Almost 24 hours later, they are back to peak.

So, in your opinion, did six days of clam contribute to what I considered peak WD 2-3 days after my last clam dose? Am I prolonging it with drinking wine before bed? A week after using clam, with the alcohol being used in the interm as I described, how ill advised would a single usage to get 6 hours of sleep be? I’ve slept 4 hours since Tuesday. 

I post this here because I think I’ll get the best answers and wisdom here. I know both drugs work on gaba A. Messing with my gaba system like I have is dumb, but I do not regret drinking on Sunday because I was getting close to really feeling the damage from lack of sleep. I pick up my gabapentin within a week and will stop any helper meds I may still be using when I do. If my lack of sleep is 90%+ contributed to phenibut, gabapentin will get me closer to baseline and with less risk than clam or alcohol to me, but only if I use it responsibly.

So I have a general anxiety disorder that started many years ago as a result of some awful life circumstances that were out of my control. I finally put those stressors behind me almost a year ago. I have been on the benzo bromazepam for several years, just taking a therapeutic dose once per night to sleep (an equivalent dose of 5 mg valium). I did a fairly slow taper over a 3 and a half month period and went off of the medication entirely two weeks ago. I know that my brain will have built up a dependence but I don't believe that I was ever addicted to the benzo.

Of couse I have had some withdrawal symptoms and my anxiety level is peaked. Its like my mind cant relax and be calm and so my body is in a constant state of hyper-sensitivity. My thoughts are always racing, and a lot of negative thoughts about life enter my mind. I do understand that once my body calms downs and heals, these concerns will dissipate. I eat pretty healthily and drink plenty of water. One coffee in the morning and not much alcohol. I try to do some guided meditation daily but its hard when the mind and body is so stimulated.

Any thoughts as to my recovery timeline or suggestions for improvement? I guess after two weeks my body is just now clearing the medicine from the system based on the half-life of 20 to 30 hours. I just want the mind to finally calm down so that the body can heal itself. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",3,0

I’m less than a week away from 9 months sober from everything, and I feel like my brain and my body are just broken. The whole time, I’ve had insane body temperature regulation issues. I am hot and sweating 99% of the time, no matter what, I even was in the 20°F weather a few months ago. I feel like it might be from post acute withdrawal, I know benzos affect your CNS which also regulates body temp, but idk i’m not a doctor. 

I also have insane memory, attention and focus issues. I’ve been trying to read for fun and even when I can muscle through a whole page, I barely remember what it said when i’m finished. Audiobooks are worse. When I think of a task I need to do, I get immediately distracted and completely forget about said task, this happens multiple times per day.

Hi. I wanted to share my perception on Benzos withdrawals after being a recent victim and researching what could help. 
GABA drugs, especially, Benzos, withdrawals are horrific, the reason that is, they basically inhibit brain function, really similar to how NMDA antagonists work (DXM, Ketamine etc). 
In withdrawals, Glutamate action is significantly increased while GABA’s inhibitory effect is decreased, leading to symptoms of Glutamate Toxicity, especially the seizures that accommodate withdrawals.
In benzos withdrawals, mania is more common than one may think, because the brain is incredibly stimulated, by excessive neural activity and neurotransmitter release. 
That may be a positive thing with occasional NMDA Antagonist drugs, contributing to the DXM, Ketamine afterglow, but during benzos withdrawals, this action becomes in an overly dramatic manner.
A major thing that could be done to attenuate Benzos withdrawals, especially to reduce seizure risk that is accompanied is to reduce Glutamate activity, this could be done by NMDA Antagonists. 
I wouldn’t recommend Ketamine as it’s incredibly short acting, which could lead to further Glutamate excitation after usage. 
DXM is a second good option while Memantine is the best option, it’s long lasting while providing glutamate inhibitory effects without major dissociative effects at low doses.  
This could also decrease some of the brain damage done during withdrawals due to Glutamate toxicity and overactivity damaging the neurons. 
I don’t know why NMDA Antagonists aren’t talked about a lot during withdrawals, especially when they appear really helpful, pharmacologically speaking, counteracting the effects of GABA drugs withdrawals to some extent.",10,0

After my first year of sobriety I Had a bit of a relapse, found out real Xanax was extremely hard to find, didn’t know what the hell was in the presses I was taking but suspect it was fentanyl in the end so went CT, had severe withdrawal symptoms, so bad they caused about a week long psychosis that eventually landed me in the psych ward for about 3 days. 

After the psychosis I was fairly sober for quite some time, I’d say 9 months or so, relapsed a bit, got back sober for bout 9 months during the pandemic and about 8 months ago I got into a new relationship.  My new relationship is with someone who has very high access to pressed Xanax.  So for the past 8 months, we have been on and off taking pressies, more often than not.  We will go through points where we decide to be sober and do about a week or so sober, and right back to the pressies, or we drink a pint of lean….Basically undoing all our progress towards sobriety.

Anyways, our relationship has obviously suffered a bit due to both our substance abuse problems.  Were probably at our lowest point and he just had a horrible and shocking loss of his best friend about a week ago.  We’re really low on money, and went on an expensive trip that was supposed to be for business that turned out to not go as planned business wise, straining my partners mental state greatly from my observations.  Not only has he been overwhelmingly disrespectful to me, but he has slept for the past 4 days just about non stop.  

I on the other hand, started experiencing withdrawal symptoms about 28 hrs after my last handful of pressed benzos (probably about 8-9 mg? I had a splitting headache for the last 4 days along with extremely low ability to sleep.  I have probably been sleeping about 3-6 hours a day this past week.  I suspect that whatever is in the pressed pills are a shorter half lived benzo than Xanax.  Since I have been through CT a few times, I already am prepared for the hell I have to feel for the first few weeks benzo free.  

Except I don’t remember such severe insomnia? And why is my partner so fatigued while I’m having an opposite experience?  I’m guessing his fatigue is grief/depression fueled.  Plus, I have to remember I don’t truly know if he is still using behind my back. 

Gosh, I kick myself for ever eating a Xanax from day 1.  It has been a constant destructive pattern in my life the whole ride.    I am feeling things slip out of my control and my life in shambles.  Losing my place to live, no money in the bank , my relationship with my parents on the rocks along with tolerating a relationship dynamic that I know I stand against.  Feeling so hopeless and out of control. & I know my chase and love for the high will never subside.",3,1

So I have OCD and during pandemic started taking Xanax unprescribed as my partner has a bunch to get to sleep. Been taking it for about 6 months was up to 4mg recently and getting bad interdose withdrawal so I got some diazpam. Been on many ssris my doc has given me mirtazipine to take tonight.

Took about 40mg valium after tapering from 4mg to 2mg over the past week so I didn’t have to take as much valium when I got it. I have taken 10mg today and actually feel fine.

Few questions -

I understand this is quite a big jump in dose but I am feeling good no twitching, shaking, aches or auras and feeling very shaky today even though it’s not a large dose. Is this normal? Should I stick to 10mg for the mornings and see how I get on?

I was planning on taking 20mg tonight however I am now going to take 15mg mirtazipine as well. Should I take 10mg instead? I’m concerned it says on the packet for rameron can induce seizures so I don’t want that but don’t want to over sedate myself.

I know on boarding with ssris can cause me to get extremely anxious and uncomfortable and was prescribed valium previously to combat this for 2 weeks. Should I take 30mg valium and the mirtazipine for next few weeks until it’s on and then taper off the valium slowly? I don’t want to use benzodiazepines as a long term solution and I wish I never went near Xanax it’s no good for long term anxiety although it did help me when I took a panic attack.

His physical health started deteriorating rapidly last year and after many hospital visits and doctors appointments we realized it was due to his Xanax use. His general dr prescribed him Xanax for those 30 years so I never questioned his use and did not know of the terrible consequences and addictive nature. Back in April he went to a recovery center to get clean. He spent 33 days detoxing (the first 10 were hell for him and I) and returned back home at the end of May. He is now in weekly therapy and takes lexapro, gabapentin and buspar. While he was detoxing I learned about benzo addiction and the painful recovery process so I could be as prepared as I could for his return. He returned home and honestly since I was expecting/prepared for the worse I dont think things were as hard as I thought they were going to be. He has his ""windows"" or ""waves"" as others call. Physically his low blood pressure and lack of sleep were the 2 main issues but both seem to be getting better now. Emotionally he is a lot more irritable with me and has some noticeable mood swings, lack of interest in the things that he used to love such as lifting weights and playing the guitar. This past weekend we took a trip out to the city as a family to visit a friend. It was the first time he had been out of the house for an extended period of time since coming back from detoxing (He is retired so he does not have to work). Unfortunately the trip highlighted how hard it is for him to function out in the real world. I saw his level of anxiety, his short temper and his eagerness to return home. In my mind he was doing better but now I know it is because he is home and does not have to deal with the things that normal people do. I cant help but feel sad for him, for us as a couple and for us as a family. I know it is still early and he is still adapting but in a way I miss my old husband even though I know this one is healthier. I guess I am just venting and mourning our past together. The times when we both lifted weights together, the times when we used to go dancing and to fancy restaurants.

I can take the twitches, lack of sleep, anxiety with insanely dark intrusive thoughts, and the feeling of wanting to be out of my skin.... But my blood pressure. It feels like the one thing that is the most crucial out of all the symptoms I've had. I take lamotragine, so that's a little cushion for seizing but my BP has been the main issue I've had in my opinion. I sadly started taking rc benzos after wanting to get away from alcohol. It worked and way too well. Anyway, since what I'm taking is unscheduled with little actual research backing it up I don't even know if it's worth putting on here. I got a way from flubromazolam, clonazolam, flualprazolam. I've gotten down to bromazalam and flubromazoPam (approximately 4 day half-life) about two weeks ago. I want to jump off so bad that I lowered too fast. I adjusted and am ok now and alright with my stock in terms of running out. But my real question is if blood pressure has been a main issue for anyone on here. 
Also, this sub helps me more than anyone in my life. Thank you",8,0

I should have posted this earlier than today. I’m scared they’ll say no because the Xanax was not prescribed to me. 

This is a really big step that I don’t think I’m prepared for. I’m ready for a slow taper plan with therapy, and I want to feel confident that this doctor will agree with me. He was suggested to me by a friend and the reviews make him seem very compassionate.

I’m tapering k been coming from 1.5 since last September and it’s been going relatively ok in comparison 

I saw a benzo wise doctor in March and we have been following a tapering schedule as follows

A .03125 reduction every two weeks which is .0625 Valium reduction  every two weeks last cut being exactly 5% from .062 to .59

This cut was met with nasty symptoms such as stiff face, td type symptoms hypnogagic jerks, akathisia, no sleep at all etc (notice that skin burning and stiff neck were not in this symptom cluster)

At two weeks out I still felt terrible so I consulted with doctor we suggested a hold for another week which alleviated it a lot, akathisia gone, jerks gone, some of the face stuff, well we had an appointment at the three week mark and he suggested holding at that dose for a whole month in addition

Fast forward to the past day or two (a little over 4 weeks) , I’m now being met with burning skin stiff neck, feeling jittery, waking up with heart racing, derealization)

I called doc again yesterday told him what’s going on, made it abundantly clear that he’s not as benzo wise as he claims to be because he told me symptoms of stiff neck and burning skin are not benzo withdrawal symptoms (LOL) and I needed to hold this month out 

Has also told me in the past k is long enough you don’t have to split it

Is this tolerance to the dose? Should I cut again the usual 5%, try less, should I hold the month recommended, should I go back to .62? I feel less stable now than I did a couple of days ago",4,0

I think I'm about to stop the NAc, like I said I does seem to help,  but it's an odd feeling, almost like an excited calm.  Since it's getting harder to get in the USA( having been banned from Amazon and Walmart ) it's just a matter of time before prices go up , or it's not available at all.  And since I don't know if long term use is safe, I figure it's better to just quit using it.

However,  taurine combine  b complex seems to really help me.  I did read taurine works as a gaba agonist. So that worries me a bit, but i also know people like me in benzo WD get paranoid and worried about almost everything , so I'm looking for some people with experience with supplements and benzos and some people who can lay out some common sense for me.

I've heard Black seed oil is good.  I realize no matter what this is going to take time and it's going to be hard,  I'm not looking for a miracle cure, just something to take the edge off a little bit. But my biggest concern is , I don't want to get hooked on something else that needs to be tapered after i've finished my benzo taper.  I was taking OTC Lithium and it helped,  but I stopped that as well.  I'm looking for something that I can in theory take for a year  without causing Withdrawals or damage.

Currently at 45MG librium, liquid tappering 1mg per week.  Down from original dose of 10mg Valium and 100mg of Librium combine.   So I've made pretty good progress, about two-thirds done.

After consulting with my pcp, I was prescribed 0.5mg clonozepam to take as needed. It worked to get me to sleep but never more than about 4 hours. 

Since January I’ve taken about 30mg in total (averaging somewhere around 2 nights per week). I’ve also used either lunesta or wine on about an average of one night per week in this time range  (both effecting the gaba center of the brain to my knowledge).

With my sleep jerks not improving, I decided to cut out clonozepam, lunesta, and alcohol completely exactly one week ago. Since then I’ve experienced even more violent jerks and heightened anxiety. 

Am I likely experiencing withdrawal here? Hoping time will allow my brain and nervous system to recalibrate because this is pretty rough. 

tldr; taken clonozepam 0.5mg 2x per week since January. Experiencing worsened sleep and anxiety since stopping one week ago. Is this withdrawal?",1,0

Basically I have bipolar disorder with severe anxiety and depression. Last December my psychiatrist prescribed me 4 mg of Ativan per day (1 mg every 6 hours). I took it as prescribed and never abused it. It was magical. No anxiety or panic attacks. Yet I did not know that drinking on it was a recipe for disaster. Fast forward 8 months later and my life had fallen apart. I just finished rehab and they cut me off Ativan the day I got there and put me on Valium. I was tapered off 15 mg of Valium 3 times a day in 7 days and am making my 6th day today. The last two days have been hell. I have been tired all the time, tension headache, temperamental, crying and stomach ache/nauseous. It gets particularly worse around 4pm and on. Mind you I started naltrexone on Thursday morning and 600 mg of Gabapentin in the morning/night right after my last dose of Valium. Will I continue to feel this way?

My addiction to Xanax got bad, if I didn't have them by the 2nd- 3rd day I would go though it, no sleep, vomiting, nausea, my nerves where out of wack, I would have crazy face twitches and shakes. My anxiety was threw the roof. It was horrible & now that I have been off these benzo's for 4 months. I unfortunately relapsed and smoked Fentynal, it's been a month, and I know I need to get back on track and kick the Fent again, I wanted to prepare for WD so I got about 15 Xanax. I couldn't help myself and I took 2mg bars for three days in a row and OMG.. I started to feel, WD from the bars!!! OMG if I feel it after only 3 days, when I WD n detox the Fentynal, I want to have some help to sleep and all. I'm a little afraid of the benzo WD as well!!! 

Has anyone experienced this? 

Any ideas on another way to WD n get clean from these drugs that are holding me back!!  I'm so tired, 
I'm also very bummed at myself for putting myself in this situation again !!   

Benzo WD has been the toughest and longest, to get back to ""normal"".... My memory and the overall time it took to get my brain working again. Took forever, I was almost scared, I had given my self learning disability. Anyone else go through this??

I’m adding my post from the day I jumped at the end of this in case anyone is interested !! I think I’m back to normal for me. I mean my memory sucks but I’m like 44 years old living in this fast paced world !! I don’t think my memory is worse than other people who aren’t benzo users. So idek how much is Xanax related. I had stomach issues the whole time, but came to find out it was a freaking ulcer the whole time from a medication I was taking (Naproxen). Anyways I have no complaints !! Except I’m gaining weight still. Which I don’t think is Xanax’s fault Bc I’ve just been eating like a champion eater since like Christmas !! My diet issues are a whole other issue tho 😁😩!! Also, I didn’t get worse after 3 weeks like I kept reading about !! I just kept getting better every week !! 

Moral of the story is I’m extremely thankful I decided to taper off this mess, and I feel so much better in all aspects of my life.  I appreciate soooooo much more in this world than I ever did !!! Your story doesn’t have to be a horror story !! 


MY POST FROM APRIL 24, 2021:

Yay I jumped !!🥳

I started taking Xanax (.5mg in the beginning) about 8 or 9 or 10 years ago🤔 !! I worked my way up to 3 mg per day within a couple of years. I took 3 mg DAILY for 5 or 6 years...Or 7..idk🤷🏼‍♀️!! But I was prescribed 4mg daily as needed from a psychiatrist !! I literally only went there for the meds!! I’m sure he knew that Bc I would go every six months and he would ask how I was. I’d say fine and blah blah blah !! Then 5 mins later he would give me a 6 months prescription. Which is exactly what I wanted. Omg I was a fr drug seeker 😩Anyways I made myself become slow and dumb to the point of embarrassment from my time on Xanax !! And this is crazy, but I also feared being cut off, so I wanted to stop while I was in control !! Anyways, COVID gave me so much time to read and research and decide that I CAN do this !! So on July 25, 2020 I started tapering. 9 months later a bitch jumped 😄!! 

And my symptoms weren’t too awful !! Stomach pain and jumpy legs at night are literally all I’ve had !! And brain fog of course. But compared to how dumb I was while taking 3mg a day it’s NOTHING !! And I know it’s possibly gonna get worse in 3 weeks, but hopefully it won’t !! I have NOT had horror stories like I’ve read about and expected to have !! I’ll let y’all know in a month if I still feel this way 😃!!

**Edit** June 1, 2021 (a month and a week or so after original post) So it’s been a great month. I haven’t had any REAL issues. I am eating a lot and getting fat 😩, but pretty sure that’s just a personal problem 😁!! One weird thing is that I was having such stomach struggles that I made an appointment for a GI to get it checked out. It turns out I had 3 ulcers in my stomach, but they said it was due to a medication I’ve been taking for like 20 years. I ignored it for a year Bc I assumed it was from Xanax withdraws! So who knows how/if it’s tied in to the withdrawals 🤷🏼‍♀️!! Either way it’s being fixed now and I have no more stomach pain🥳 !! Overall I would say I have had ZERO w/d after jumping !! I take my Tylenol pm for sleep, but I’ve always taken something to sleep. Which is the main reason I loved Xanax to begin with!! I would say I’m back to normal (though I’ve never been truly normal 🤪) except for the memory issues. I still have short term memory problems 😩but it’s like 70-80 percent better than it was when I was taking Xanax 4 times a day !! My leg jumpy things at night time went away a couple of weeks after jumping also !! I was terrified that was going to last a long time and possibly get worse !! Hopefully I’m in the clear tho!! Bottom line is this: It CAN be an okay experience!! It wasn’t as awful as all of the stories I read about !! No, it wasn’t pleasant, but it is totally doable !!",55,1

Compared to something like xanax, when does Valium withdrawals begin to set in, after consistent daily use for an extended period of time? TO BE CLEAR I’m not addicted to either drug rather I’m curious what people typically experience when dependent on one versus the other. To rephrase, How long after cessation of Xanax does one feel withdrawals, versus when addicted to Valium? Any input would be greatly

Edit:
To make things more cut and dry, let’s say hypothetically I was using either compound every day, once a day at 2mg for Xanax or 10mg Valium, for at least a year. Following cessation how long after the last dose would one need to take another dose before running into serious trouble?

They are not the same.,"It seems like I’m constantly in a conversation on here where someone tells me to; “stay strong and avoid relapse” or “this is the time where you risk wanting to take the pills again” or something else to similar effect. 

I’m not discounting the devastating effects of addiction, nor dismissing the fact it is an illness with victims. 

However, there are many people on here who are not addicts. They did not abuse Benzos or buy them on the street. Many, like me, were prescribed this medication by their doctor and took it at this prescribed amount for longer than 2-4 weeks, without being informed of the horrible risks associated with doing so! 

We do not struggle with relapse or crave the pills. I do not fear “who I was without them” because I never took them for any life long condition or problem. In fact, I was a pretty  healthy and happy human being before this “medication” robbed me of my life. I already managed my anxiety with things like meditation and exercise. I took this medication because ANOTHER medication gave me short term insomnia. 

Next time you write a post about us all being addicts, or you comment on someone’s post about relapse, remember that many of us are in fact victims of iatrogenic dependence. We are not psychologically addicted to these pills. We became physically dependent at the hands of our doctors who we trusted. 

We were never warned about the dangers. Many of us spent weeks, months and maybe even years becoming sicker and sicker, without realising why. Many of us blames ourselves. Why didn’t we know? I’m an educated person, how could I not know? Why didn’t I research it? 

But it is not our fault. We are victims of an iatrogenic dependence. We trusted people to do their jobs, their duty of care, and they failed us.

There have been a lot of fearmongering posts on the sub as of late. To wit:

1) a Rice Krispy treat will throw you back into acute withdrawal

2) a cigarette will cause a major setback

3) multiple posts that benzos, without question, cause permanent brain damage

There are more. And I want to be entirely clear that while I do not discount ANYONE'S personal experiences or opinions, I think it's important to recognize that when someone asserts with authority and warns everyone that ""X WILL CAUSE (insert problem or symptom here)"", that is not helpful. 

Sharing experiences, talking about what happened to you personally seems totally appropriate. But making sweeping assumptions or giving straight up misinformation and applying it to everyone is likely scaring the pants off of a lot of people, and results in not only fear but probably discouragement as well.

One thing I hope we can all agree on is that no one's journey looks exactly like anyone else's. Yes, there's a lot of overlap in symptoms...but just because I experience something doesn't mean you will, and vice versa.

I'm hoping we as a community can recognize this difference and perhaps take a more measured approach to some of these kinds of threads, especially for our new folks.

I want to share with you all those things that were most important to my healing . .. believe me, I tried everything short of rehab cuz I knew that would just make it worse, especially the benzo part.. these are in no particular order..  1. You MUST have support.. whether a spouse or partner or family member or counselor..  it is impossible to do it alone...  2. I used to laugh at the meditators, but can now say meditating and breathing excersizes  have been amazingly helpful.. don't knock it till you try it.. download an app and start out slow, I highly recommend Medito.. its free and starts you out slow.. the breathing part is especially helpful.. Still use it to this day, begin my day with 15 min of breathing and presence.. 3. Stay away from highly processed sugars and meats.. pretty much if it comes boxed or pre-packaged  it's a no no.. something about the connection between the brain and the gut..  if your gut is healthy, your brain will follow.. take a probiotic daily.. I drink a few ounces of Kefir everyday and am amazed at the diff it makes, in more ways then just mentally..
  4. Stay away from anything that is Gaba-ergic.  Theanine, st johns wort, passion flower, etc etc all they do is delay your healing with minimal benefit.
5. stay busy.. do not sit and dwell no matter how bad you feel.. stay moving  walk, run, excersize, do yard work, volunteer, etc anything to keep your mind occupied.. 6. I know it's cliche but focus on one day at a time and consider each day a victory when it's complete..

Funny I would have laughed at some of these recommendations had I read them before I started my taper..  but I guess I embraced a lot of them because I realized I didn't have much choice.. it was either try the things people recommended or just give up and die... I chose to live, and here I am 16 months clean and recently realized that not just days, but weeks go by without me ever thinking about the struggle anymore..  occasionally in the evenings I can feel a little edgy, but it's becoming more and more rare.. I would say it's the way I was before I started down the benzo and opiate path..  just feeling like I need to take the edge off occasionally...  Now instead of reaching for a pill or a drink I just take a quiet moment to focus on my breathing and remaining present...   
 I am thankful to be where I am.. you all can get there too... ..  more than happy to answer questions or provide support if I can.. don't hesitate to reach out..

Used Nitrazepam for recreational use as it always made me feel like a god (my sister introduced me) to the point of doing 75mg a day, while also being prescribed Clonazepam. Nitrazepam was something else for me, not even coke, speed, or meth made mee feel as godly like when I was on it. 

Anyway like any other benzo story, I burned a lot of bridges along the way, hurt my family, ruin relationships including my own and other people, and basically become uncontrollable. On 2017 after a period I would call hell I stopped. I relapsed in 2018, and recently I relapsed again.


I feel like when you had addiction to benzo, your brain chemical structure is already altered in some way, and when you take benzo again after a long period of not using, it feels like it kinda shifts back really quickly to the ‘fog’ or ‘haze’ if you know what I mean.

Well my benzo relapse was bad, it was with Etizolan and I blacked out on my gf’s birthday party and long story short because of it she’s an ex now. She hates me. Thankfully I was not physically addicted, though the trail of destruction was apparent.

Fast forward one month, I am benzo free then I got an email from a legal vendor saying that Etizolam will be banned in where I live, so better stock up soon (yeah you can easily guess where I live from here) 

I burned many bridges, almost died many times, hurt someone I really love, hurt my family, and a did many of other despicable things. 70% of me thinks “fuck off, I wont do this shit ever again”

However, 30% of me wants to buy in bulk, 300-500 pills of those and just… idk. I guess once you’re addicted to something, no matter how much that something made your life a mess, your brain can somehow trick you to an illusion that you want it and somehow you can be fully in control. 

you wont.

I really want to get rid of that 30% man. I have a good thing going in my life, though my relationship was ruined I got my dream job and loving new friends. But somewhere, somehow, deep down inside there is still that 30% of me that is calling for more benzo.

“More! more! more! you already learned a lot of lesson so this time around you can be in control!!”

I’m accepting the fact that its gonna stay like this for the rest of my days, but I feel like it could be a bit easier to live without this 30%.

what about you guys who have recovered? do you also hear and feel this calling? 

And for those of you who are recovering, I wish you luck. beautiful things await you once your brain rewired itself back to (almost) its full glory

Cheers

TL;DR benzo sticks with me even after recovery, and my brain calls for more.",5,0

Thought it was time for my 11 months update being clean from benzo’s. Having used ambien over a decade daily and a way to fast valium taper (8 weeks) I have suffered a lot.

I am still in PAWS but life has gotten better. In the first six months I could not get out of bed, had mental akathisia and over 40 other symptoms. I wanted to die daily and thought about suicide daily.
I could not watch tv, read or do anything else. Days felt like months. A stupid mobile game (clash of clans lol) got me through my days.

I lost my C-level job after my taper as I got so sick. I developed anxiety which I never had and agoraphobia. I am still scared to go on longer drives but I do notice improvements. 

My vision was fucked up for a long time, I am glad to report that recovered. 

All in all I cannot work yet. Its draining on me emotionally as I feel useless and a lot of times hopeless af. I got a new awesome job offer and tried it but my anxiety and extreme fatigue was too much to keep up with the demands for the job. I just keep faith that it will keep improving but it goes SLOW for me.

I’ve been dependent on Temazapam (30 mg) for sleep for about 5 years now. I am now attempting to get off of them (with help from my doctor).

I have a lower dosage prescription to the meds (22.5), and have been alternating between the two for the past few weeks. I’m now starting to do 2, sometimes 3 nights in a row on the 22.5 (and one night a week going without, completely). Over the past 8 days I only took the full strength twice.

My sleep is crap especially on the lower dosage nights and my days are very low energy (unable to even nap). I used to think that my lack of sleep was due to the fact that I assumed that my brain had forgotten to fall and stay asleep naturally but I’m now wondering if the crap quality of sleep and low energy is due more to withdrawal from the benzos. 

It’s probably a combination of both.

PS, I am doing other things like trying CBD/melatonin on the nights I don’t use the pills, plus I started back on my CPAP, which has helped a little. I also have made an appointment with a therapist but that’s 3 weeks away.",3,0

Weening down, 2mg+ clonazolam a day, Advice and inspiration appreciated Clonazolam","Story time and about me: (Scroll down if you want to get to the weening quitting part) Been a user/ addict for 15+ years. Quitting a few times for short periods in between. Have gone through and been in withdrawal hundreds to thousand of times. So, they have allot of experience on drugs and this subject. So, to keep a long story short. My imaginary friend took to many substances (flexeril, morphine, clonazolam, lyrica, and kratom), they blacked/ passed out on the bed of a ninjas secret lair, got beat up by a meth’ed out ninja whilst my imaginary friend was blacked out speaking the linguistic dialect of morphlings in slurred murmurs (they were kicked in the balls a few times, kicked in their bad knee, kicked the inside of their right leg, karate chopped in the throat, judo chopped to the collar bone/ clavicle, scratches down their back, and maybe head kicked a few times: concussion).

Then the meth’ed out ninja delivered my imaginary friend to the neighbors. Then my imaginary friend had a mental break down for the victims of Satanic abuse (they watched a few documentaries, read a few articles on it the day before, and they just caught a satanic pedophile with 500+ pictures and videos abusing children in horrific ways right down the road). My imaginary friend got a ride home from the neighbors where they continued to cry for the children the whole ride home. Then when my imaginary friend got home they got naked and started screaming stomping, and banging on the walls like an angry gorilla. Some one called the ambulance and cops. They come narcan my imaginary friend a bunch of times bring him to the hospital where apparently he may of died a few times, and then my imaginary friend wakes up days later in a hospital bed with no idea where he is, what day it is, or what happened.

If anyone reads this that may of been involved in my imaginary friends story. My imaginary friend is very sorry and thanks everyone who helped my imaginary friend. Friends, family, Hospital, nurses, and god. Thank you and love you all.

Quitting Everything: They have weened down from 2+mg of clonazolam a day to 1.5mg diclazepam and 1 table spoon of Kratom every twelve hours. They would lower the benzo every 4 or 5 days. They Experienced minor withdrawal symptoms such as vividly lucid dreams, a little dysphoria, a little insomnia, some irritable bowels (like once a day), and minor hallucinations. They also take a multivitamin, 1200mg ashwagandha, ginseng, turmeric, a liver protectant (NAC or milk thistle), long acting 120mg pseudoephedrine every 24 hours, some praying, lots of love from a few kitten my imaginary friend saved, and lots of electro lights to stay well hydrated (these things really do help or at least they help my imaginary friend).

Update: They just received sixty 200mg lyrica and are now taking 400mg lyrica, 1.25mg diclazepam, and 1 tbs kratom every 12 to 16+ hours. They are experiencing little to no withdrawal symptom with the lyrica added. They are going to lower the benzo by .25mg every few days then quit and then lower the kratom a teaspoon or 1/2 a tea spoon every few days then quit. Then they are going to lower the lyrica a little bit, but continue use as needed for chronic pain and the pseudoephedrine for allergies.

Update: Things are going good. My imaginary friend weened down to .75mg Diclazepam. They wanted to ween down to .125, but unfortunately they ran out of Diclazepam and they do not believe any will make it to them on time if they order more. So, they are going to jump from .75mg Diclazepam and see what happens. They will continue the kratom, and lyrica and hope for the best.

Update: Struggling…. Ran out of Diclazepam early. My imaginary friend added Phenibut and they are weening down from the Phenibut hoping it will help level out Gaba A receptors a little better since they jumped from a higher dose of diclazepam then anticipated. Phenibut 1000mg and 12 hours later 750mg and in another 12 hours 500mg and another 12 hours 250mg and so on. Continued lyrica and kratom use with the phenibut.

Update: Right now my imaginary friend is on two table spoons of kratom, 7mg phenibut HCL, 200mg delta 8 chewables, 300mg Lyrica, and the other stuff mentioned before (vitamins, ginseng to create calm energy, milk thistle as liver protectant, ashwagandha to lower cortisol stress levels, 120mg long acting 12 hour pseudoephedrine for sinus/ energy, and praying to keep my mind on the greater good of things in life). Things are going good so far. Hardly any withdrawal symptoms from anything so far. Weening and substituting is really helping.

Dosing every 12 to 16+ hours. Weening down the Phenibut HCL 7mg, 3mg Phenibut HCL, and then 1mg Phenibut. Also,Running out of lyrica so weening down on the lyrica from 300mg to 225mg lyrica to 150mg lyrica to 75 mg lyrica to 32.5 mg lyrica to 16mg lyrica to 8mg lyrica to 4mg lyrica, 2mg lyrica, and to 1mg Lyrica. Then weening down on the Kratom 2 table spoons to 1 table spoon and 2 teaspoon for 3-5 days then 1 table spoon 1 teaspoon then in 3-5 days lower the dose to 1 table spoon or 3 tea spoons, (At this range of kratom some start to feel a little bit of a struggle so they are lowering the dose a half, quarter, or smaller spoon each dose so they experience far less to zero withdrawal symptoms till they reach zero) then just quitting delta 8 chewables Or might ween down quickly. They are going to continuing vitamins and supplements everyday. Then a few days later adding a diet and workout routine to get back in shape and detox anything left over in their system and adding a study routine to keep their mind and body busy.

&#x200B;

Update: Taking 2tbs kratom and 300mg lyrica every 12 to 16+ hours. Almost out of lyrica and can’t order any more that will get here on time. So, instead of weening off lyrica my imaginary friend is going to suppliment Phenibut in lyrica’s place and ween down off the Phenibut. We are going to have to see what happens.

&#x200B;

Update: My friend relapsed. They aren’t going to give up though. They are going to come up with another game plan and try again.

&#x200B;

I will continue to keep this thread up to date of my imaginary friends progress.

*Pick a dose and jump off, or taper to zero?*

I ask because my taper has gone fairly well, ivr had rough (and really rough) days, but mostly it has gone pretty smoothly. I started at the equivalent of 20mg valium daily (ativan), then switched to valium and dropped to 8mg, and have been steadily tapering down by .5mg weekly to where I'm at now (2.5mg daily). Some weeks I cut 1mg, but then I got stuck on a cut for 14 days and switched to .5mg cuts. 

My questions is, what is the right dose to jump at? Should I taper all the way to zero the way I'm going and be done the first or second week of september, or should I just jump and get it over with? 

First benzo withdrawl, second gaba drug withdrawl, and I was on benzos starting last October/November .

I want to be able to share some research or information with her as to how this could indeed be possible. One is as a long-term benzo user of 11 years played a role. Another is that seven months may not have been a long enough taper for being a long-term user. And another that I perhaps should have microtapered beyond 1mg. Anything else?

About 3 weeks ago I came off a crazy benzo binge, over the course of a month and a half I did about 1g of etizolam and like 3 other RC benzos, was doing stimulants near the end, Adderall, Coke, crack. Also was doing about 10-15g of kratom a day for a couple years.

My friend got me into a detox, but I left a day and a half later. The guy even warned me that I could have a seizure and go braindead. I honestly don't think I even was in withdrawal yet until a day after I left. I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to leave, but I really missed my dog.

I had someone pick me up and decided to drink heavily and do acid that night. Next day woke up in full withdrawal. I chugged half a 1/5 of whisky in about 5 minutes and continued to drink heavily til I passed out... then woke up to a door falling on my head thanks to the drunken idiots that were still awake.

I decided to go to the ER that night because the acid kicked back in, and IDK if I was having HPPD or was about to have a seizure, but the lights really bothered me for about a week after this. Ended up getting a little bit of ativan, then they sent me home a few hours later. Dehydrated and defeated I walked home from the hospital in fear of the withdrawal that was to come. 

I had a friend give me small amounts of xanax at a time. Even with the xanax I was still tremoring like crazy, had a couple moments where I thought I was going to have a seizure but luckily that never happened. After about a week of hell my friend couldn't give me any xans anymore and I turned to RSO. The RSO seemed to help more than the small amounts of xanax I was taking trying to taper off. For once I could finally take care of my dog and go for walks. Since then I have been working out as much as I can, have only used edibles, and nicotine which I am currently tapering myself off of as I am adjusting to a new, better diet. I lost almost 15 pounds since the start of the binge, which is disgusting and good at the same time. I plan on staying healthy and working out whenever I have the urge to get high.

I honestly never would have thought I could go off of that high of an amount of research benzos AND kratom. I am very proud of myself. I want to get to the point where I become the man I admire and help my friend and other people get off benzos and other drugs. There's not really any good role models in my group of friends and I feel it is my duty to be the better man and step up. It sucks that everyone I know is hurting and going through shit but if I keep doing the right thing I can be a role model for them. If I can come back this strong from rock bottom I know anyone can. 

It's been a crazy time. If anyone's going through benzo withdrawal just keep. going. Don't look back. Once you get through the withdrawals you should have a new outlook on life. I feel God has spared my life so I can build myself up and help others. Having a concussion while going through benzo and kratom withdrawal was hell but now I know that I am stronger than I thought I was. You are too.",7,0

I've been tapering valium for about 3 months now and I'm getting to the tail end of the taper. I'm on 2.5mg per day split into two doses, and will be dropping to 2 on Wednesday. Symptoms have been up and down throughout the taper, but I would put them at mild-moderate most days with the occasional day or two of moderately severe symptoms. 

Anyway, I have a tattoo appointment that I've had for almost a year coming up in 16 days. I was thinking that if I made my cut on Wednesday then held there for two weeks instead of the usual 7 days I've been putting between cuts, I might be able to keep my appointment. I don't want to cancel because my artist is notoriously hard to get in with. 

I was just wondering if anyone had experience with tattooing durring a taper, and if it is in any way more dangerous than getting a tattoo normally would be. I plan to stabilize on a dose for two weeks before my appointment, and I've got a fairly good handle on my baseline anxiety. Anyhow, any thoughts?

for muscle spasms/ feeling like im vibrating/ feeling extremely extremely restless - i did this almost every night before bed or when it was at its worst, multiple times a day https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=86HUcX8ZtAk i also took a walk everyday, even if all i could manage was up & down the block, magnesium !! 

for insomnia/ just general anxiety/ feeling in a constant state of panic -
Natrol Slow Release Melatonin, CBD MD's melatonin infused cbd tinctures, N8 essentials standard CBD tincture, Olly ""stress be gone "" gummies ( with the gummies, do not take them everyday or get reliant on them ) 

for dp/dr - this one is tough, my biggest advice here is to push yourself to sit through the discomfort, you will become functional with it i promise https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jti35OeSZVc i did that meditation whenever i needed too

for the depression/intrusive thoughts- i kept a video diary, and spoke to myself on the other end of it, journaling was never really my thing, so this worked better for me. i took it as an opportunity to talk entirely judgement free, to cry to someone, to get the thoughts out of my head, vitamin D3 

for the hopelessness that you wont get through this- EXTREME positive self talk, im talking annoying yourself with how optimistic youre being, even if you dont believe it in that moment, you will repeat it enough that it will become your thought process. i also made a paper chain for everyday i had left of my taper when things got really bad, i added a few extra rings in case i needed to level out for another day or so before dropping, and made it a giant celebration every night when i took one off.

constant sweating - vitamin b13, wearing loose light weight clothes, i would sometimes shower 2-3 times a day if i had to be anywhere

feeling sociopathic/not having emotions - if youve ever seen dexter, do that. pretend as best as you can. deep down you will know your emotional reaction to whatevers going on, even if you dont necessarily feel it

i thought i was going crazy, cry as much as you need too, ask for as much support as you need too, breathe deeply & affirm to yourself whatever you need to hear in that moment 
ultimately none of these will fix anything, but for me at least, they helped.
i probably have more suggestions i cannot think of right now, so if you have any specifics you're looking to ease, either message me or comment below & i will let you know!
THE BIGGEST thing you can do is take this day by day, if thats too much, hour by hour, 10 minutes at a time. if you're ever feeling like this is too much, and your thoughts get dark, tell yourself you will make it through the next ten minutes, keep repeating that
you are strong enough, none if this is permanent, you will heal, you do not need these pills to function, i promise you.",16,0

I still feel changed after this experience, I am more selfish because the fear of death really got rid of many of the weaknesses I used to have. Like realizing that I might die cold and alone of a seizure, after which my family will believe I overdosed and try their best to forget about me was pretty eye opening. (Even if they knew it wasn’t an overdose it would be seen as a junky death which would mean they would make a joke out of my death.) 

I will never allow myself to be at risk like that again or at some stupid fucking plug or doctors mercy.  I just am happy to not feel like I am dying anymore and don’t ever want to withdrawal from this shit ever again. This Reddit helped me more than most my peers, I really appreciate it.",14,0

I wanted to provide a positive perspective, as it can be daunting to quit when you come here and read the horror stories. 

I had been taking some form of benzo for 10+ years. What started as a legitimate aid for anxiety, quickly turned into a dependence that shook my core and transformed my identity. There is no avoiding the fact that quitting benzo's suck. The risk can be mitigated, but ultimately it is a very challenging process full of ups and downs. 

On my b day this year I decided to give it up for good. It was quite awful at first, and stayed that way for a few months. I've been told that you stop emotionally maturing once you  become an addict, and that when you get clean you are kinda starting back up at that age. Reflection is fucking hard - especially when you feel like you have wasted such a large part of your life. Quitting benzos has allowed me to determine what I want in my life and perhaps more importantly what I do not want. I decided to move closer to family, and to also quit smoking weed (which is a long standing habit as well). Am i happy? ehh, thats always subjective, but I'm on the path towards happiness. And ultimately, thats what is important

It does get better. It does take time. Some days still suck but at least I'm not running from that. I hope this can help provide motivation to those considering making the jump. I'm here for anyone who could use support.",14,0

Back again with some things that have helped me during this journey. I took 2-3mg ativan daily for ~4 years. Tapered for about 6 months and jumped 2 months ago. 

Here are some of the things that have helped me. I’m still riding this crazing rollercoaster, but having a good day so I thought I would share:

Water & electrolytes - this is essential. During some of my worst waves I realized I was dehydrated

Nutrition - healthy fats, protein, micronutrients, and calories have helped me. Your body needs nutrients to heal. Sometimes it’s hard to eat but quantity matters too

Exercise - it’s hard to get up and do anything especially exercise. Your body wants to move. I never regretted going for a walk/run

Sunlight - try to get outside and get some sun on your body

Perseverance - there’s going to be hard times. When the hard time comes it’s hard to even think of anything positive. You have to fight

Faith - pray and pray often",7,0

""Why this weird mafk telling me to eat breakfast, im dying from benzos idiot stfu"". Trust me, I KNOW. Also trust me when I say that eating a solid meal today and every day is one of the first key steps in staying benzo free. Eating breakfast isn't about routine, or if you like certain foods, or how early you wake up. Its about SELF CARE.

Remembering to treat ourselves right before anything is probably one of the most fundamental cornerstones to a proper recovery, and staying mentally strong enough to fight our brain demons. Making sure our body and minds have the proper fuel and energy for us to be our best selves is SO SO SO important, its one of the first things you can do every day to PREPARE yourself to FEEL GOOD, and MAKE GOOD DECISIONS.

Most important thing to remember, even if you don't feel like eating or taking care of ur house or showering or whatever, never ever ever forget; YOU DESERVE BREAKFAST

I’m not doing horrifying stuff and saying terrible things every day, I’m not in some fantasy world completely separated from reality doing crazy nonsense anymore.

I made it through though, and After 18 months, I finally feel normal again. The journey was hell, I’ve never known a worse pain.

I CAN LOVE AGAIN! I can normally experience emotions again, the insane psychosis and all of the terrible mental problems I THOUGHT I had were being caused by such powerful CNS suppressants. The world looked cold and gray, the things that gave joy meant nothing to me and I miss not feeling sometimes. THIS IS ALL VERY NORMAL AND IT IS ALL OKAY. It’s part of the process. To change everything, I stopped speaking to certain people(enablers and stress factors) I stopped going to certain places, I would like myself in the mirror and literally practice speaking again because I felt like everything I was doing in my “past life” was wrong.
