I'm tapering away from benzo's after 3 years of being prescribed 2mg Clonazepam daily, and abusing illicit for the last 6 months\~2-4mg extra. Since October 30th, I've been tapering with decent results, all the way down to 10mg Diazepam p/day (which I believe is .5ish Clonazepam - So from 2mg down to .5mg in 2 months). 

The Holidays came and went, as did my birthday on the 17th, and I ended up slipping pretty bad.

8mg Ativan Dec 24th/17mg Dec 25th/5mg Dec 28th&5mg Dec 29th

I have 15mg Clonazepam leftover, and i'm still on my prescribed daily taper of 10mg Diazepam. 

I'm not sure whether to suck it up and go straight back to my daily taper, or take an extra Milligram for the next 3 or 4 days to mitigate difficulties. I was/am very dedicated to this change of lifestyle; but as many of you can attest to - it's difficult to pull away from that insane wave of relief from this chaotic world we live in. It was such a pleasant few hours to just ..be away from the last 2 months of depressing, anxious, humiliating, hyper and generally challenging feelings.   


TL;DR - Interrupted my taper for 5 days rather notably after 2 months of progress. Should I carry on with the taper immediately, or take an extra .5-1mg for a couple of days to make the transition back more manageable?",2,0

I‚Äôve had a history of drug addictions but next semester I‚Äôm taking quantum mechanics and I need to be at the top of my game. 

I have so much to rebuild but the catalyst to all of this change was the death of a very close friend from an overdose. I‚Äôd known him for a decade and he was a gentle soul. His situations that he had grown up in forced him to deal and he was damn good at it because he was a natural in math. He was the one supplying me additional klonopin when I would run out before the script could be renewed. He helped me stay afloat and time and time again I swore I would get off it but I just couldn‚Äôt until yesterday when I finally set forth my New Years resolution into action. I finally took only 1 of my klonopin instead of two at a time with my two Gabapentin as I knew they are synergistic. It‚Äôs going to be rough because I have to ready myself by relearning multi-var Calculus and linear algebra before I can even play ball in quantum. 

I‚Äôm well off in the sense that if I ever fall, I have a safety net regardless of the situation and I am grateful for it and it‚Äôs probably the only reason I‚Äôm not dead yet. We swore to find financial independence, I swore to finally finish college, the story I started since 2012. I will carry on our promise. I WILL get out of debt, I WILL master my craft - chemistry and I WILL teach myself data science. Working these grueling mind numbing ‚Äúspecimen processor‚Äù jobs with mid shifts makes it so difficult to do anything on top of everything. 1130-830 + (40 * 2 travel commute). It‚Äôs hard to juggle life and addictions. Starting January first, I‚Äôm also going to stay away from alcohol and weed for the entire year. If I could delete all my poisonous social media (snap, insta, Twitter, FB) then I can hold true to this new resolve. 

Please send me your energy, I don‚Äôt even know what that means because I‚Äôm a science major and atheist, but for once, please just send me your energy to move forward, because I know I have to but I can‚Äôt do it alone and I feel so goddamn utterly alone... please. I need it now more than ever.",4,0

I‚Äôm on 20mg daily of Valiumwith up to 30PRN for treatment from a hospital fuck up that ended up with me on Ativan from Xanax(which we finally realized I was experiencing constant kindling and severe withdrawal symptoms for months after being gaslighted that it was just anxiety) , then figuring out what Benzo would work right for me to taper. And that journey was from Klonopin to Ativan to now Valium . It seems like I‚Äôm tolerant or maybe what I was getting off of is finally hitting the end of its life. But regardless, I was doing okay with the 20mgs daily for a bit. The first day we did 40mgs to be safe because I had already needed 6mgs of Ativan to not keep withdrawing hardcore. The 40 was too much. Then the 30 was too much. The 20 seemed right for a bit. I was functioning slightly. Had some energy and my mind was less cloudy. But now over a week later. I don‚Äôt feel well and I feel the withdrawal in between doses of fucking VALIUM. It‚Äôs supposed to last longer inbetween. Yeah the withdrawals aren‚Äôt as intense thank GOD. But I‚Äôm scared. I was on such a low dose of Xanax before but because of my misuse and improper dosing and constantly detoxing and retoxing I got shafted. I‚Äôm trying to tough it out but the dissociation is killing me and making me more anxious and the weak knees. And the wanting to pass out and breathlessness. I have a damn oximeter I always check and whaddya know it‚Äôs always fine. 

I was prescribed 25mg of Luvox by my benzo specialist to help tackle the already set in depression, OCD, and anxiety but now I‚Äôm afraid of taking it because there is an interaction (especially the drowsiness and possible shallow breathe) and just even the potential side effects like increased anxiety and having to dose up more. Even if it‚Äôs a low dose and he‚Äôs assuring me there won‚Äôt be an interaction I have trust issues from the medical system pumping me full of benzos. I was prescribed today but I‚Äôm waiting until tomorrow or maybe I‚Äôll wait until the 20mg of Valium finally levels me out after everything passes. I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôm only 23. I want my life back. I wanna stop being a burden. I‚Äôm in tears everyday silently because I just can‚Äôt find anyone to relate to. My father who has been fucked on benzos has the audacity to tell me that next time I should have known better and to have taken my anxiety by the reins but he‚Äôs been stuck on benzos for over 30 years and swears he only uses it to sleep and has SHAKEN ME DOWN FOR MY SCRIPT IN THE PAST WHEN I NEEDED IT TOO. And even enabled my use by telling me to get more from my psych, who I loathe for even giving it out like candy. And I just feel like such a disgrace to myself to have sunken this low. I had worked on being off Xanax before only to retox when the panic set in instead of using other methods and now I‚Äôm here because of my own ignorance. Doped up beyond a level I couldn‚Äôt have imagined (and I know comparatively people may say it‚Äôs not much, but my friends, back then .25 or less of Xanax would be able to relax me or knock me out). 

I just wanna be off benzos. I hate them. I always hated them. And I hated myself for knowing that they worked on me so well. And now they‚Äôre my worst fight imaginable. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Or am I just dead set on one day fashioning a brompton cocktail? I‚Äôm still fighting. But the days are getting harder and harder.",3,0
7,2020-12-30 02:23:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/kmxmg8/derealization/,Derealization,"I'm still quite early from finishing a rapid taper, before trying to jump at 0.125 clonazepam unknowingly when all hell broke loose. It was a low dose but it seems like clonazepam is brutal for paws and just being on it daily for 3 months was enough to screw me up more than anything ever before - and I've done a lot of drugs in my life.

&#x200B;

I have a full body tremor that reminds me I'm in WD on the physical side, but my worst symptoms are mental. Derealization is something I've experienced before benzos but this is at a new level. I feel so cognitively impaired that I spend most of my time aimlessly walking around my home. I can hardly watch TV, couldn't follow a movie when I tried to hang out with a friend. Basic chores like laundry and grocery shopping seem to take all my mental power. Overall I feel like I'm seeing my surroundings but my brain isn't connecting to them, I used to have organisational OCD and would get a kick out of organising my space and cleaning but now I just have no connection to the environment.

In withdrawal it's been hard to think about exercise and generally keeping the brain active, and it feels like the longer I just exist without engaging my brain or body in any way whatsoever that is kinda a risk of making this all worse, it's like a downward spiral.

I also had a very weird experience trying to go to the shops a week or so ago and had to leave because I felt like I was literally hallucinating and couldn't understand where I was. Overall I'm just completely dumbfounded how a drug that can fuck up your mental health so badly can be used in psychiatry at all, let alone so commonly!?

Sorry this is a little long, but I'd like to hear how people (especially klonopin/clonazepam ppl) deal with the feeling of derealization and whether it tends to pass. I don't know if exercise is my best bet at the moment. Overall I'm scared that I will never feel normal again.",5,0

Yes I had anxiety before the xanax and when I quit it skyrocketed into horrible rebound anxiety but the longer you stay sober the more you actually feel normal again. Normal as in not depending on these pills to avoid life itself.

My story included.,"I‚Äôve been on 6-8mg (sometimes more) of Xanax every 24hrs for a little over 3 years. I have never tried to taper before. This drug just took over my life without it me even knowing it. 

Before ever taking my first Xanax, I never had anxiety. I was truly a carefree healthy person. I only smoked weed and that was it. The first time I took Xanax I just felt really careless and warm it was a beautiful feeling. Originally I was buying prescription 2mg green bars. I would buy like 10 at a time and take them thru the week. Then I had to start buying more and eventually the real script dealers ran out. So I had to turn to the web to get my Xanax bars, and yes I made sure they have all been real Alprazolam thru lab testing. 

At this point this drug is just affecting me. I just want to get completely off it. In the past when I was running low on Xanax bars I would take Kratom so I wouldn‚Äôt go into full withdrawal symptoms. 

Some times I would run super low and take half my 6-8mg dose a day and would have severe withdrawal symptoms, such as panic attacks , couldn‚Äôt sit still, extreme anxiety ,  could not sleep at all, among the other symptoms like feeling like I‚Äôm about to have a seizure and brain glitches. 

As a reminder, I was never prescribed any Xanax ever, or any other pill. This is the only drug I take. I‚Äôve recently even stopping smoking marijuana altogether. I do not even drink alcohol.

I have heard about the Ashton manual, and how they want you to switch to klonopin or Valium and taper for a year or longer.
- to be honest I would like to be free of this devil drug Xanax as soon as possible. Are their any other alternatives to the ashton manual that would get me off quicker without feeling like complete shit all the time and taking a year or longer? 

Thanks to this sub I have read people take things like 5-HTP, L-Theanine (spelling) and other things to help them. 

What would happen if I went to a doctor and told him this same story? I‚Äôm afraid they will try to put me in a detox center which would completely fuck me up mentally or kill me. I do not want to die that is my biggest fear.

All in all I‚Äôm just scared for my life, I do not to be mentally fucked up the rest of my life, and all your guys post have made me make this decision to get off these Xanax. 

I beg you guys for your help. You guys are all I really have right now. Please if you are reading and this and have went thru something similar please comment or DM me so we can talk. If you can get me off this stuff safely I will literally pay you. That‚Äôs how desperate I am right now.

basically Xanax does for me what I always wanted from any drug I experimented with. 

I suffer from anxiety my whole life, I am not really worse than the typical guy however taking just 0,25-0,5 mg makes me into the man I always wished to be basically. Just not anxious and comfortable.

What do you think is a safe dosage for me that is long term sustainable? For example 1-2 times a week for like a date or something stressful?

What is the best alternative to get to such a state without xanax any of you know of? 

Is it therapy? Qutting stuff like junk food, alcohol, social media, masturbation, etc.?",2,0

I am new to posting on reddit but definitely need assistance here.  Story a bit complicated with the pharmas but In summary: 29 year old male.  I have been on Suboxone for 6 years and Klonopin on and off for 4 years.  I have tapered off Klonopin with valium successfully in the past but 2.5 years ago went back on 1 mg daily because I tapered off of 20 mg lexapro and it gave me horrible anxiety/panic attacks.  In short -  I had been put on many different pharmas because of a 1 yr drug addiction when I was 20.  Never been depressed in my life before that time. tapered off the lexapro because it was ruining my life but could not do it without the Klonopin.

I feel better now off the Lexapro.  All the while I have been on suboxone.  Trying to taper down.  I am down to a very low dose and have recently had to take a little bit more Klonopin to cope with the withdrawals.  For the last year I have been on only .5 mg klonopin.  Taking it at 5 at night, not because I felt like I needed it, but because I didn't want to withdraw.  Though, 3 weeks ago the suboxone taper got bad and I upped it to 1.5 mg.  So it hasn't been awhile on the higher dose.  I eventually want to start tapering off the klonopin and get off completely, even if it takes a while.

Are there any supplements that help with the GABA receptors?  I feel like i have truly screwed mine up from all the use, different doses, different medications, etc.  I also do generally have anxiety but in HS I was able to handle it without medication.  So if I can get off the Klon, I would like to.   or I'd like to at least get to a lower dose

please let me know what you think could help me start to drop or what you guys have had experience with in the past - whether it has worked or not?  THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT",2,0

38,2020-12-28 02:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/klm2jt/windows_and_waves/,Windows and Waves,"Hi, all!

As of today, I'm almost nine months clean from benzos, alcohol, and all the rest.

This past April, I very nearly died that most literary of all deaths -- *death by misadventure* \-- but lived to tell the tale, and am just now reaching the point where I can comfortably process my experience and share it with others: those in recovery and those who aren't and likely never will be. It's occurred to me that my experience, gruesome as it was, should no longer be kept to myself. It's not something I should be ashamed of and, like all other brushes with the beyond, it should be written about and talked about for the benefit of others. 

I've lurked on this forum for a while, and I'm always struck by the same thing in all of you that I unearthed in the depths of my own mind: *courage*. I certainly didn't think of myself as a courageous soul until I plunged ass-over-head into the abyss and slowly crawled my way back out. But no matter where you are in your own misadventure -- white knuckling it through the first few days, pushing through the purgatory of long-term sequelae, or miraculously unscathed on the sunny side of hell -- it takes a fuckton of *courage* to deal with what we've dealt with. And whatever else our addiction has compelled us to do in the name of feeding it, whatever bridges we may have burned, whatever else can be said for us: it cannot be said that a single one of us is weak. Because if you're still here, you haven't folded. And while it would not even be weak to fold, it is truly gobsmackingly courageous to endure. 

I'm not sure what the rules are for posting outside links on this forum; my intent is not to promote my own work, but to share an experience that I suspect might be beneficial to the folks here, especially to those of you who might just be starting out. I farted this out in three or four hours, but the thoughts are the result of nine months of rumination on the experience that has consumed most of my CPU power this year, even as the rest of the world has fallen to shit. 

One of the stranger aspects of benzodiazepine withdrawal -- and an experience I was relieved to encounter time and again on this forum -- is the ""windows and waves"" phenomenon: the notion that, for a good long while, benzo withdrawal *does not get better.* Or it does for a moment or two. But then it gets worse. And then it gets a little better. And then it gets much worse. And so on, for minutes or hours or weeks or months or years at a time. This is perhaps the most unique and certainly the most maddening aspect of benzodiazepine withdrawal. But, even if it's hard to see it when you're in the belly of the beast, it does (once you've gotten past those windows and waves) ultimately *get better*. It eventually becomes something you can look back on with wonder and, yes, even with some small amount of amusement. 

A gratuitous quote from *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:* 

 ""Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've won it. It‚Äôs going to get better now. You can sort of tell these things."" 

Cheers!

It seems like Xanax users are more prone to interdose withdrawal and fast onset of acute withdrawal, but I kinda am fearing that Klonopin/Clonazepam is actually a different beast entirely if taken daily.

If you take 0.5 clonazepam a day, the previous dose is still in your system the next day. So a cold turkey of clonazepam is not exactly a cold turkey off the dose you're taking is it? 

A friend sent me a graphic suggesting that 0.5 clonazepam taken daily is the equivalent of a dose of 1.65mg when taken over 7 days. So for me cold turkeying off clonazepam after 3 months, who knows what kind of compounding effect that has had.

I am 9 days into jumping off a badly managed, rapid valium taper. It seems like the withdrawal hasn't finished intensifying yet. It makes me wonder if daily use of a long acting benzo is actually more harmful than we think it is, and may explain why clonazepam often seems to be the benzo of choice for the protracted horror stories, while Xanax issues seem to be more associated with kindling and higher doses.

Has anyone else experienced major life upheaval during taper or withdrawal? How did you handle it, practically and psychologically?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

For context, I‚Äôd been living in Germany with my ex-partner for four years. My partnership ended in a terrible way in February, and I took daily high doses of Valium to cope with the trauma. But then I got so suicidal that I checked into a psych ward, which tapered me over 2.5 months. 

While I was there, COVID hit and I found myself with nowhere to go. I don‚Äôt have any safety nets in the US, but here in Germany I have good healthcare, so I decided to stay. Housing was still an issue. No one would take me as a guest, so I moved to a new city with someone I‚Äôd started dating and since then have been trying to pull life back together. I have to find income and a new residency permit because both were dependent on my ex. It‚Äôs a tall order with my symptoms and their interactions with recent trauma.

I‚Äôve been off benzos for 7 months, but I still feel depressed, anxious, have terrible concentration and honestly can‚Äôt work a job yet. I still have periods of suicidality when I can‚Äôt see how life will look like after this madness and am sure I‚Äôm going to die broke and homeless because I won‚Äôt be well enough to function. So hearing how other people have coped with financial instability, loss of relationships or other world-shifting losses during taper and withdrawal would help me a lot. Thanks!",9,1

Fast forward to yeserday, 2 months after that, told my neurologist that I had not taken it, she asked me about symptoms, which I have many (also from my thyroid condition), and she insisted I take bromazepam, 7 drops for a few days, or in extreme cases 10 drops, and as soon as I feel a little better and the symptoms ease a bit, to slowly reduce the drops and then stop taking it (let‚Äôs say something like 1 month use in total). Yesterday I took the 7 drops (thanks to a shitty episode two days ago, took my gf to the ER for a cut she got on her finger, and while there my friend who came with us fainted in front of me, that really made me feel bad in those moments, I almost fainted too lol, and haven‚Äôt been feeling ok these past 3 days), managed to sleep last night, but now I am once again questioning myself if I should take the bromazepam or not. 
My neurologist really insisted I do, telling me it is different from other benzos, no side effects and no risk of tolerance for the ammount of time I am supposed to use it, but being a benzo, I don‚Äôt trust these words. Also she said she wants me to use this and that she doesn‚Äôt want to put me on other stuff. heavy stuff since I am still young (even if I already was on the heavy shit lol).

**************

I‚Äôm starting my first Ashton attempt at a taper after 10 years of 3mg klonopin use. I have my doctor‚Äôs support, but not much else.

About 15 years ago, I was on lorazepam, and I‚Äôm unsure of the dosage. I was concerned about my drinking back then, so I started attending AA. I had a pretty crummy psych doc back then. When I talked to her about my drinking concerns, she kicked me off lorazepam cold turkey. ‚ÄúLorazepam isn‚Äôt for addicts,‚Äù she said. Having no idea what benzo withdrawal was, I went along my merry way. When I started exhibiting symptoms, I then wholeheartedly believed I was an alcoholic. I was detoxing from my two or three drinks a week, right? My sincerity was real. And AA members were awesome. They would answer their phones, day or night, meet for coffee, the tons of meetings, and the ‚Äúshared‚Äù fellowship. I accidentally successfully detoxed from lorazepam with AA.

I now know I‚Äôm not an alcoholic. It‚Äôs unconscionable to join AA now that I know I‚Äôm not an alcoholic, but I‚Äôm not sure NA is an appropriate place, either. 

I‚Äôve tried the benzo specific group mentioned here and a handful of Facebook support groups. I feel really pessimistic with them.

This is a quick guide on what's going on with seizures and what can be done very practically, besides tapering slowly, to prevent damage and seizures. Proceed implementing this with caution and judgment. Specifically, do not load up on strong nmda antagonists.[edit: I'm advocating use for short term.]Ask your physician if possible. 

Quick and crude overview of mechanisms: Gaba is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter. They counteract each other the way the gas and break on a car do. Benzo addiction is like pressing the break and having the hand break on so your body upregulates glutamate, presses the gas. But if you stop taking benzos your neurons will be in over acceleration mode which can lead to seizures and excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity  -- glutamate binds to ampa and nmda receptors and allow in too much calcium which results in oxidative stress and to cell damage (ROS leading to inflammation and cell membrane damage)

NMDA antagonists to the rescue: NMDA antagonists should be protective against seizures and excitotoxicity by inhibiting the calcium channels. This lets go of the gas in a time when your breaks are cut (gaba withdrawal). 

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9593834/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9593834/)

On NMDA and Excitotoxicity: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920427/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920427/)

Nmda antagonists and sensitization. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766724/

"" It is well known that **agonists** of **NMDA** or AMPA receptors can elicit **seizures** in animal or human subjects, while **antagonists** have been shown to inhibit **seizures** in animal models, suggesting a potential role for **NMDA** and AMPA **receptor antagonists** in anti-**seizure** drug development."" [https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/3/464/pdf#:\~:text=It%20is%20well%20known%20that,in%20anti%2Dseizure%20drug%20development](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/3/464/pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20well%20known%20that,in%20anti%2Dseizure%20drug%20development).

NMDA antagonists that are accessible without having to wait in case you just read this and you want to act: magnesium and DXM and relates compounds (found in NYQuil and other cough medicines). [https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/57/3/333.full.pdf](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/57/3/333.full.pdf) Although abuse of DXM can lead to seizures!!! Agmatine supplements. You can also buy memantine online or score some Ketamine from your local K dealer. 

On Ketamine preventing seizures [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41397-019-0120-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41397-019-0120-2).

You can use NAC to counter some of the potential toxic effects of Ketamine. However, NAC may raise glutamate levels which seems counter productive.  But its good it's a superantioxidant and will prevent ROS as a result of excitotoxicity and good for many organs including liver. see ketamine toxicity and NAC[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6102060/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6102060/). But there is probably no worry in infrequent/short term use of Ketamine. 


Here is a list of NMDA antagonist for more exploration: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA\_receptor\_antagonist#Examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist#Examples)

riluzole is also one and it is under investigation as an anxiolytic but it may be hard to get your hands on it as it is a prescription drug for ALS.

NMDA antagonism is probably most important during withdrawal but probably also for some time after it. 

Obviously, the brain is incredibly complex and so nothing is as simple as it might seems. Again, proceed with caution.",9,1

Address is in the comments. If anyone has any questions that aren't covered or made clear in the guide, just ask.

Edit: I forgot to mention I called my local compounding  pharmacist to make sure It was an acceptable method, and they confirmed.

Massive avoidance traits and one therapist (the one that put me on loads of benzos and other meds) mentioned I could be schizoid.

Anyways despite lots of issues my biggest concern is my cognitive skills, or diminished ones.

I don't recall the majority of my past , can't seem to make proper new memories and am overall super slow (note: my head as broken as it was , was always my biggest asset) and bed bound.


I was totally ""on autopilot"" for quite a long time and it's scary to not have had noticed it.

Now: 22 months of benzos and almost 1 year off weed things are pretty broken. I see things I've done in the past and don't recall nothing about it despite a vague context.

This memory loss is not restricted to the benzo+other meds use but before and after...

Did several MRIs over the years and nothing, blood sample had some high TSH a year ago but ""normal"" now...

I'm at loss because as it is with memory even therapy is borderline useless and just for the day to day...

Ideas or recomendations?

Had a lot more I could add but it's already loaded of info :/

I was only on clonazepam for 10 weeks, so my doctor has tapered me quite fast

I tried to cold turkey from 0.125 clonazepam about 8 weeks ago and experienced hell for the following four days, I think this was a crucial mistake as I've never really stabilised since

So four days after trying to jump I realised I couldn't do it and reinstated, and then rapidly switched over to 2.5mg of diazepam. I have tapered the 2.5mg diazepam in 8 weeks which I realise is quite fast, but thought I could get away with it due to only being a few months on in total.

So 8 weeks following attempt at jumping took me from 2.5mg down to 0.5mg diazepam, and I tried to jump off two days ago. I have not tolerated this well at all I think due to the cold turkey attempt and also cutting every two weeks since then.

So my dilemma is in what I do now, two days into trying to jump again. Is it too late to reinstate 0.5mg diazepam and try to stabilise on it before trying to cut a little lower? Or is the reality that my fast taper means I have to stick with what I've done and reinstating won't help? Despite 0.5mg being where Ashton recommends jumping, the two short days I haven't taken a dose have included a lot of strange symptoms that I didn't even experience in my rough taper - particularly DPDR, tunnel vision, vertigo.

I'm in a weird spot with my overall short time on and off, and I am not sure how to decide what to do next - reinstate or tough it out and hope for the best? Please help.",6,0

I had no idea what they were or any of this. Just stopped taking them because I felt weird. Had the worst 1-2 months ever, and if I told you my symptoms nobody would believe me...(my doctor or anyone I talked to didn‚Äôt either...). Some ive never even seen mentioned here...

Anyways - fast forward a year. I‚Äôm back to my normal usual anxious OCD deal closing worrying about everything self I believe üôÇ

The final odd stage for me to feel like my old self would be to have alcohol at a small family or friend gathering (less then 3-4 people and socially distanced). 

What will really happen if I have 1-2 drinks of a beer or a white claw?

I know many have extreme stances on this. 

What will actually happen?

Will I reverse progress?

Will I simply just not feel good the next day?

Is it possible it will just be a normal buzz and no side effects other than normal next day alcohol side effects?

I did notice in the Ashton Manual (read twice) it says specifically:

‚ÄúSimilarly with alcohol: a glass or two of wine is perfectly permissible (and even said by some to be advisable for health). Although it is important not to substitute increasing doses of alcohol for decreasing doses of benzodiazepines, there is no need to deny oneself small pleasures. Moderation is the key: there is no call to be puritanical.‚Äù

Not sure why she would add that, if it was so dangerous/avoid at all costs?

I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to caffeine and have pretty much had it all year. Yes, more anxious but the mood and energy enhancement is priceless. 

Just wanted to know if I can go back to regular drinking (2-3 at once, once week or so...)

I also have experience with abusing benzos, specifically alprazolam, for extended periods of time.

Despite this, I have been clean off of heroin for over two years due largely to suboxone maintenance. And not to pat myself on the back, but I take literally 1/16th of what I am prescribed and so am pretty happy about where I am in regards to this life-long opiate addiction and recovery. But when I was prescribed suboxone I was also prescribed clonazopam, 1mg daily (0.5 in the morning and 0.5 during night).

I ended up taking *much less* than what I was prescribed with kpins as well. For the last six months I was only taking 0.25 a day (half a 0.5 in the morning). Been on it for a little over two years.

The withdrawals did not manifest themselves immediately nor intensely. They began about a week, two weeks into stopping taking. I have been experiencing the most intense paranoia I have ever experienced in my life. Anxiety attacks are so frequent that I feel like my adrenal gland is beginning to stop functioning. I have seasonal affective disorder and I believe that this has turned into full blown depression. I have a newly formed agoraphobia that disallows me from even going to the store down the street. I was honestly considering overdosing but couldn't bear the thought of going to go cop with the intense fear of people I currently have.

By far the worst part is the auditory haullicinations that occur daily. Hearing conversations about you that aren't happening or assuming that talking that is occurring is somehow about you. Feeling like you are hated for no reason whatsoever. I've begun isolating and haven't left the house in weeks now.

Called up an inpatient facility and they basically intimated to me that since I'm not shaking in withdrawal maybe I shouldn't go. As a recovering dopehead, I know the beds can be put to good use, but as someone that is in extreme depression and possibly schizophrenic, I think I may qualify for evaluation. It honestly was kind of condescending but whatever, I'm the fucking loser.

Now I now K can be addictive in itself, so I am not encouraging its use. But if you know what you're doing it can be a wonderful tool. It is different than traditional psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. I know why they use it in therapy now.

143,2020-12-18 10:05:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/kfmr11/the_debt_model_of_benzo_use/,"the ""debt model"" of benzo use","I had a sudden bolt of inspiration today that I believe has helped me to better understand how benzos work (including why my doctor says ""take them intermittently and for emergencies only,"" why I usually ignore this advice and take them every day until I run out, and why my anxiety goes haywire when I have none and am waiting for my next prescription)

this is obviously just a toy model and doesn't accurately describe everything, but I figure you can think of taking a benzo as ""borrowing against your future anxiety""

sort of how if you have an unexpected expense (let's say 200 dollars) and can't cover it with your salary, you can take a payday loan. you have to pay that loan back next month, so you're going to be short 200 dollars again. so what do you do? you take another payday loan. and boom, you're in a cycle of debt that feels inescapable

so it is with sleep. a lack of sleep increases your sleep debt. and, according to what I have read about homeostasis, the human body keeps a perfect tab of exactly what is owed. and if you keep not getting enough sleep, the debt increases

as someone who struggles with chronic insomnia (most likely caused by the monthly cycle of benzo withdrawal), I know that it isn't as easy as that. of course, insomnia often results in a state of chronic exhaustion, etc., but it functions like the payday loan trap that many people (including myself) regularly get stuck in. unless you're able to reliably regulate your sleep, it is easy to end up bouncing between borrowing against your future sleep and trying to pay it back

(to continue the analogy, you can ""default"" on your sleep debt, but doing so is fatal: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal\_insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_insomnia))

I may be wrong, and please point out flaws in this analogy, but this seems to map pretty well on how benzo usage functions

let's say that something stressful happens today and I want to take a benzo as an anxiolytic. as far as I understand it, that medication works by being an agonist for my GABA receptors. it provides temporary relief, for sure. but the brain keeps a tab. in the sense that the brain's neurochemistry adapts to the increased levels of GABA agonists

if I am understanding it correctly, this manifests in two ways:

\- the same dosage loses its efficacy over time (tolerance)

\- cessation rebound symptoms (withdrawal): as the GABA agonists return to their original levels, the brain experiences this as a GABA deficit. in a very intuitive way, I think, this is experienced as the opposite of an anxiolytic (i.e., if an increase in GABA signaling reduces anxiety, then it would seem to make sense that a decrease in GABA signaling would produce anxiety)

what's important here is that your baseline GABA signaling is sort of not important. the brain adapts. what produces an effect is a change in one direction or another. take a benzo, shift the level up, temporary relaxation. as the level falls back down, temporary stress

(I am using ""stress"" very broadly here to just mean something that agitates your sympathetic nervous system)

again, this might not be 100% correct. but it seems like a useful model for intuitively understanding how benzo usage works

if I take a benzo to help with something stressful today, I am borrowing against my stress levels tomorrow. when tomorrow comes around, what's the easiest thing to do when my stress levels increase? take another benzo. like taking another payday loan. before you know it, you're stuck in a cycle of taking benzos to help with the stress \*caused by the benzos\*

it also seems to explain why tapering works. you're effectively creating a payment plan. you're paying off the debt in small, manageable increments

I feel like this way of thinking about benzos is gonna be useful for me on a day-to-day basis when I am considering dosing. I can just ask myself, ""is it worth borrowing against my future anxiety for this?"". some of the times, the answer is going to be an unequivocal ""yes."" I think that benzos can be useful, especially for people (like myself) who struggle with other ways of managing their psychological and physiological stress responses. the same way financial credit can help to ride out life emergencies. but it also seems clear to me now how easy it is to fall into a cycle of debt

Panic attacks and anxiety disorders are why I was prescribed to begin with. That being said:

I‚Äôm on Ativan: I‚Äôm taking 5 mg a day spread throughout. There are still times where I feel sick and we just had to change off of Klonopin because that was not working that well. I got up to 4 mg a day and was taking it for up to 3 weeks. Even with klonopin I still felt withdrawal effects. But currently my doctor says that I‚Äôm not withdrawing anymore. 

I know that once a benzo is introduced you‚Äôre pretty much safe from any serious withdrawal symptoms (I.e seizures) but my question is: since the chemistry of each medication is different, can I still feel withdrawal from klonopin even with this upper dose of Ativan that I take in the daily?

Edit: I‚Äôd like to make note that it was an immediate switch from 4mg klonopin to 3mg Ativan worked up to 5

Edit 2: maybe my body is just getting used to the Ativan too quick. But idk why I‚Äôm descending into crap especially at this dose.

I wasn't going through this myself, but someone I love more than life itself was, and it was terrifying. I can't properly put into words how scared I was. Watching my SO go through a CT WD, not knowing what was real and what wasn't, spending 3 days in ICU followed by a 3 month taper because we didn't have a way to get what was needed for a longer taper. It was Hell. Was the taper easy? Hell no. It was like a 3 month extended WD with the worst of the symptoms just waiting, barely held back. I didn't feel like I had anyone at the beginning. Our family wouldn't have understood, some of them would have acted like my SO was a POS for relapsing to begin with. Others would have been cruel and ridiculed the decision, or gloated. I couldn't lean on my SO for support because if I showed even a fraction of anything other than complete strength and confidence that everything was going to be okay this would cause SO to spiral into a complete panic attack, followed by days and days of anxiety and sometimes even suicidal ideation. I wouldn't have wished any of this on my worst enemy. 

But, I wasn't alone. During the worst of the CT stage of things, when my SO was so far gone into his ""reality"" that he didn't have even a basic understanding of what was going on around him, when I watched the strongest man I know sobbing during the tiny moments of clarity he had, I stumbled across this group. I went from wondering if this was ever going to stop, or if this was just him now. This group saved us. I mean that. The support I got was amazing. That so many people were willing to help and encourage me, and through me encourage and support my SO, brought me to tears more than once. Just knowing that y'all were here and I could make one of the classic ""Hey, is this a symptom?! Is this normal?!"" posts and immediately get answers (everytime was a yes....benzos are fucking awful) and see every answer followed by ""It's going to be okay""... We wouldn't have made it without that. I wouldn't have been able to stay strong for him. I will never ever be able to thank y'all enough. 

I'm rambling ofc, but the point of this is to remind everyone going through Benzo hell right now that no matter how bad it gets, IT GETS BETTER. This isn't forever. It will pass. You will heal. And most importantly no matter how small, scared, broken, and just generally hopeless you feel... you're strong. What you're going through is the hardest thing I have ever seen someone do in my life. Are you one day in to your taper? Fucking good on you, this shit is hard and every second that you hang in there is a testament to just how strong you are. I promise, you will get through this.


My SO spent days in what he still describes as Hell. There's a solid week of his life that he doesn't remember even one minute of reality, his reality was one long delusion that he thought was real. But, he made it. He's almost 6 months post-taper and clean, he can function again. He's able to control his emotions again he's slowly returning to a normal (better imo) him, a pre-benzo (but again....a better version) him. You will too. You just have to hang in there. üíñüíñüíñ",52,0

Long story short I was using RC benzos daily for about 4 months. I eased into a diclazepam taper. I had planned a 10 week self taper and was forced to jump 3 weeks early for a reason I do not have the energy to discuss. This is my second time going thru this. First time being with regular RX benzos ( alprazolam mostly ). If anyone has experience WDing from RC benzos not RX benzos I would love to here your input. I feel awful, but I am still able to sleep, just not comfortably Have also been experiencing night terrors. My dreams have been displaying the most vile and evil things to me like rape, murder, dead corpses being eaten by other animals. Constant crippling anxiety and derealization. It caused me to resign from my Job today, forcing me to move back home with friends while I recover. I will be losing my car now because I am too cognitively impaired to work as well. Bummer. I am hoping to be back to baseline relativley quick because of my relative short time of use, but with RC benzos I am not sure what to expect and I am only on week 1. I am having to start my life over again. I feel the lowest I have felt in 2 years but I do still see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Some examples of RC benzos:

Clonazolam

Pyrazolam

Flualprazolam

Diclazepam

Nitrazolam

I'm trying to quit Xanax and tapering was just leading to me craving more and relapsing again so I (foolishly) tried going cold turkey after I took the last of my bars. A day or two after this, I hadn't slept for over 24 hours and I started experiencing a shit ton of muscle spasms and involuntary little yelps. I don't remember what happened next but the day I woke up I was EXTREMELY sore and I bit the shit out of my mouth and tongue. I could barely walk or eat because of how much my muscles ached and how much it burned my mouth to eat anything.

This happened a few weeks ago. I relapsed (I know, it's stupid but I thought I could manage it this time) last week and I am now experiencing the exact same thing: insomnia, twitching muscles, and then a seizure. I know it was a seizure now (the emergency department from the first time didn't diagnose me bc I'd never had a seizure so they had no reason to think I'd had one) because I actually remember the epileptic cry (sounded like a dying gasp) and I completely lost control of my muscles which all became very tense, and the next thing I remember I was awake at night with sore muscles, a bitten tongue, and a headache which made me throw up. The muscles and tongue aren't as bad as they were the first time but they're still hurting like a bitch.

Does anyone know of something I can do to ease the pain and prevent future seizures? Aside from, obviously, not relapsing, but who fucking knows about that, right?

I'm definitely more energetic or more like have more energy in the muscles which = strength.  I've also become more defined and I physically look like I've been doing light workouts when it's just the creatine it self.

Definitely give it a try people.  Also keep in mind I have a natural muscular base however since I've been lifting since a young teen.  So I have a base of mature muscle which may be why it's working so well for me at least for the muscle definition.

So I've always been a serious weight lifter so my life sort of revolved around supplements. Especially in my younger years but now I just try to stick with stuff that's been studied heavily and actually work.

Anyways I highly suggest creatine to people who want some more muscle strength and it definitely feels better overall during this taper.

I stopped working out a couple of years ago. I would've been back but due to covid I'm not risking it having to socialize a lot with family members frequently.

&#x200B;

Creatine enhances cognitive function over time, helps your muscles keep hydrated, store more energy, and because you're creating a more anabolic environment within the body you will be in a less catabolic state as well as help gain muscle. They sell them in capsules and powder.

I take the capsules for convenience. Optimum Nutrition 2500 Creatine caps. They have 100ct, 200ct, and 300ct.

I found that on ebay you can get 2x 200ct and it's a better deal than the 300ct bottles.

5g a day for a couple of weeks then just take the regular 2.5g dose everyday.

Add some taurine capsules, your choice of magnesium, and you have a very solid supplement base for your muscle function(including heart), some added minerals(bones and heart), taurine(slows down adrenaline release, helps support overall cell function)

&#x200B;

I am way less lethargic, I feel bigger, better, and stronger.  I forgot how amazing creatine is.  It helps me get out of bed much easier then when I didn't take it. I would have absolutely no strength and just feel so tight and stiff like always after waking up. Since that is when adrenaline and cortistol is the highest.

&#x200B;

Anyways give it a try. You don't have to get ON brand of course but do try to go with a reputable brand and make sure it is CREAPURE brand or at the least make sure it is mirconized creatine. They're basically the same thing except Creapure is just patented micronized creatine.  Though I do believe most people swear that Creapure is superior. Honestly both work for me. However regular creatine can give me the shits just fyi since it's too grainy and not like soft powder.",5,1

I‚Äôm worried about a former friend who was prescribed benzos as-needed for anxiety (I want to say clonazepam, but I could definitely be remembering that wrong), and seemed to be relying on them a lot ever since she suffered a serious personal loss last year. I was a little worried back then, because she felt like she needed to take them whenever she felt any grief, but I figured she knew the risks and was being careful so I just gave her the benefit of the doubt and kept it to myself.

Fast forward to today, and she‚Äôs a totally different person. She gets explosively angry about things I don‚Äôt understand, she forgets entire conversations, and at the same time she has very vivid/specific memories of things that I *know* didn‚Äôt happen ‚Äî but I also know she‚Äôs not a liar, and would never have made those things up. It got to the point where anything we talked about, I could be sure that she‚Äôd have completely forgotten it by the next day, like it never happened. Interacting with her started to make me feel like I was losing my mind. But when I look at old emails she sent me years ago, they‚Äôre intelligent and articulate and kind. All I know for certain is that she‚Äôs under a lot of stress, and she told me she was relying on more meds lately to get by.

I‚Äôm not looking for an armchair diagnosis really, because I know I can‚Äôt know for certain what‚Äôs going on, and if it is an addiction I‚Äôve missed my chance to help in any way because our friendship is pretty much irreparable. But I was just wondering in general, if anyone would be willing tell me a little about common warning signs to look out for, or point me toward resources where I could read more? For anyone who has been through it or watched a loved one go through it, would you be able to tell me what that typically looks like?

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just an asshole or being anti-medication for assuming she has a drug problem, but I don‚Äôt really know how I would know either way, and I don‚Äôt share any mutual friends with her who can give me a sanity check here. There are so many things that don‚Äôt make sense to me about her behavior, and I can‚Äôt tell if I am crazy or if this is something that should have been obvious to me all along. I guess I would just like to know more, because this is a subject I‚Äôm not familiar with, if anyone has any information.

At one point when I was hanging out with her last summer, she said that her vision was tunneling, she couldn‚Äôt stand up and started falling forward in a way that, looking back, reminds me of videos of heroin users nodding. She wasn‚Äôt really conscious, but she said she didn‚Äôt need an ambulance, just for me to stay with her and make sure she was still  breathing. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know what medications she was taking, or what her specific health issues were, but I assumed it was an awful side effect to something that she would obviously tell her doctor about later. It makes me sick to my stomach to remember this, but I‚Äôm worried I might have ignored a really obvious problem all this time and lost a friend because of it.",4,0

I feel like I‚Äôm getting better. But today I felt a little off and I‚Äôve developed twitching again on my calves and thighs. I didn‚Äôt have it much for a while. Is there a chance this completely goes away? 

What baffles me is that I took so little and I inter dosed. I would take a dose every other day and I got to the point I had withdrawal symptoms in between the days I didn‚Äôt take Ativan. I even hyperventilated. I couldn‚Äôt control it. It‚Äôs wild because I never took any drugs in my life and I never drink. Maybe interdosing caused a larger impact to my nervous system. I had every symptom in the book, I felt like I had brain damage. I felt like shit for months. I feel better now. But still not 100. 

This twitching is really fucked up. Is there proof that people actually fully recovered ? I hope I feel better as the months go by. 

I‚Äôm planning to start working out again, maybe that will improve my nervous system? I feared MS for a long time.

I tried tapering off them last year and didn‚Äôt succeed, and I‚Äôve tried several times actually... but I always had long drawn out tapered plans. I understand coming off benzos CAN BE dangerous. But us taking it normally suffer from anxiety and so we think it‚Äôs going to be worse than it is. We read the side effects, count down the hours since we last took a pill, think about it 24/7 and it makes it so hard. 

I know it sounds silly, but it really is mind over matter. Yes it‚Äôs addictive and yes it can be dangerous but your mind is so much more dangerous than you realize. I stopped almost 2 weeks ago. Prior to that, I did taper. I was taking 2 mg for 8 years and for a week I went to 1.5, another week at 1 and then 2 weeks at .5 before stopping. 

When I was tapering, I didn‚Äôt really notice the side effects like I did before because I wasn‚Äôt watching the clock or thinking about it. Before you stop taking benzos you NEED to have a plan of how to keep your mind occupied and ways to cope with your anxiety naturally. I kept myself busy and was able to taper pretty easily. 

Once stopping I did notice I had side effects like headaches, dizziness, increased anxiety, heart palpitations, nausea and chills were the most annoying. But you need to tell yourself that these are temporary. The choice you‚Äôve made to stop will effect the rest of your life and the side effects are just a small obstacle to freedom! 

I know side effects are terrible. Trust me, that‚Äôs why I failed so many times before. But they are manageable, YOU CAN DO THIS. I know people see ‚Äúseizures or death‚Äù and freak out because I did the same thing. Unless you‚Äôve had seizures or have underlying Heath problems, you‚Äôre probably going to be just fine. I googled the signs of a seizure and everything. My doctor told me that if you‚Äôre having one you‚Äôll know and so I stopped googling. Just stop googling. It‚Äôs not good. Listen to your body & do what you think is best, just don‚Äôt give up! 

I know this was a lot, but if anyone has any questions or needs someone to talk to, feel free to comment or message me! None of my friends have ever taken klonopin so getting off of it and feeling how I did was definitely a solo journey, but that kind of made it more special. I‚Äôm just happy I have a community to share it with in hopes of encouraging others! üòä",94,0

If one was experiencing PHYSICAL symptoms of withdrawal and decided to take what was to them a 'normal dose' would this relieve the symptoms nearly instantly once the benzo has kicked in? Or would it take a few days of dosing to help the symptoms.

Seems stupid to me and I'm pretty sure if you are withdrawing and take the drug you are withdrawing from it will pretty much instantly alleviate the symptoms - but part of my brain thinks that this isn't necessarily true

I decided to up the Clonazepam dose to 6.0mg Clonazepam and keep the Diazepam at 15mg as an experiment because I have many more mg of Clonazepam than Diazepam on an AlprazolamEquivalent basis.

Last night I had a panic attack and loud ringing in the ears. Everyone was asleep in my house and I was having auditory Hallucinations, a symptom I have never experienced. I thought I heard the news on the living room TV on, like the 10 o'clock news. The TV was off...

So I panicked. By my usual bedtime dose, I took extra diazepam to make the total 7.75mg AlprazolamEquivalent (Clonazepam Equivalent). I ended the day taking **35mg Diazepam** and **6.0mg Clonazepam**, yielding approximately 7.75mg Alprazolam equivalent. 

I feel guilty, but I really thought I was going to have a seizure. Was this a sign of an immanent seizure? Did I taper too fast? 

 
For reference, I was on 8.0mg AlprazolamEquivalent (AE) December 1st, so I think I tapered too fast. Tonight I will try 7.5mgAE, and keep it there for another day.

Is this normal? I had noticed Tinnitus developing only in the last week, so I'm thinking that I just tapered too fast from December 1st to now.

Took myself to rehab the beginning of this year and was extremely proud but due to the way this year has been, found it hard to not relapse and it drove me mad.

Was hating myself more and more for being so stupid and going back to these dangerous pills. But tonight after taking some diazepam instead of xanax I get from a trusted vendor, I have felt a lot better instead of guilt which I usually have once I start fading on Xanax

See diazepam was my original prescription before I started abusing, so I don‚Äôt know why I ever went to Xanax, maybe just the popularity, following society stupidly thinking it was cool whilst also combating a genuine debilitating self hatred & anxiety attacks.

I think from now on, I‚Äôm okay as long as I don‚Äôt let it control me, and I‚Äôm not using every day, but if I feel like I really bloody need it! I‚Äôm going to take it, if I think it will stop my mind from driving me to point of insanity fuck it, it helps me and I‚Äôd be stupid to not accept help...

I have been using the equivalent of roughly 2mg alprazolam each time I‚Äôd dose, although during the first week it was more closer to the equivalent of 1mg or so of alprazolam. The days I haven‚Äôt used benzos (which was actually Sunday-Tuesday this past week, although last Saturday was the first day out of this whole ordeal that I used a long acting Benzo like Valium), I‚Äôve been functional and able to live my life fairly normally, it‚Äôs just that when it comes close to bed time, I just can‚Äôt seem to relax well enough to fall asleep.

This whole thing with benzos even started because I just got over quitting an opioid dependence which benzos helped me get through (along with gabapentin and clonidine in the first week). 

So with all that background information, would I be better off just quitting while I‚Äôm ahead and just deal with the insomnia? Or should I do a short taper (and if so, how)? I just REALLY do not want to have switched from an opioid dependence to a Benzo dependence, that‚Äôs the LAST thing I need in my life now.

I appreciate any feedback.

(I should also clarify that the benzos in question are mainly flualprazolam but also bromazolam and a twice use of clonazolam and the long acting Benzo is norfludiazepam (Norflurazepam).",11,0

Is there a ""lesser of two evils""?

I know they are both bad. My (limited) knowledge is this: Benzos are addictive, can make you stupid and effect memory and other stuff. Withdrawal is rough (I know, I've been through it). Ambien is also addictive but isn't really anxiolytic as far as I know. And according a sleep doctor I saw years ago, it basically puts you in to a coma but you're not getting quality sleep. It just gives the illusion of it. I've used both in the past for years.

He‚Äôs been taking a lot of Xanax for about 2-3 months....about 5-7 bars or so a day. He‚Äôs ready to stop but the only detox in our area that will take patients without insurance is going to detox him starting on just 2mgs of Ativan, and tapering extremely quickly. They also don‚Äôt have any beds right now. He really wants to stop. I know micro-tapering is recommended, but the other problem is that he is also on methadone for opiate dependence, which he has been on for years successfully. Prior to the Benzos he had been clean for years. He fell into a deep depression and turned back to his ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for feeling so discontent and depressed. Well, because of the Benzo use the methadone doctor has been decreasing his methadone dose by 1mg every other day, and it‚Äôs to the point now where he‚Äôs starting to get sick from that. Until he can pass a drug screen with no Benzos in his system the methadone provider will keep tapering him. So the problem is- based on what I‚Äôve read it seems he needs to taper very slowly off the Benzos, but then again, that means his methadone dose is going to keep getting lower and lower, which is a problem too. My question is, given the time span he‚Äôs been on Benzos and the amount he‚Äôs being using, how much do you think he should taper and over what period of time? He doesn‚Äôt want to spend several weeks or months tapering from Xanax, and really can‚Äôt afford to due to the methadone decreasing. But then again he can‚Äôt stand the Benzo withdrawal either. I literally feel hopeless for him. I can‚Äôt even imagine how he must feel. The detox in our area said he would probably be there 7-10 days max for the Xanax detox, maybe 5. I honestly don‚Äôt even if they really know what they‚Äôre doing and they‚Äôre government funded so they obviously want to get people in and out ASAP. With the amount of time he‚Äôs been on the Xanax (2-3 months), is there any chance at all that the Benzo withdrawal may not be *THAT* bad?

I have since stopped drinking completely (several months ago... no longer part of the withdrawal equation) and reduced have tapered down to 2.5mg or so.... a dose that I have been consistent with for around 2-3 weeks. I still feel very anxious and find myself counting down hours till I can take my baby dose...which often doesn't make me feel anything at all.

I am thinking about just jumping to zero. Will this likely improve the way I feel? I sense that at this point, taking it at all is only prolonging the dependency. I want to be off this.

Then I got hooked on Farmapram 2mg bars. I was going thru a breakup, lost my job and said fuck it. I experienced what I can describe as a light seizure still working in May (as an order builder) one night and knew I was dependent. By June, I was taking at least 20mg Alprazolam a day, sometimes 30mg. I knew something had to be done.

My Farmapram connection got caught and I had to look elsewhere. This was in August. I realized I had a real addiction and had to do something about it. I had around 180 Farmapram left and tried to taper. 

I started a log of my use beginning in August, still around 20mg a day. I knew I would die if I didn't taper correctly. I tried spreading out my farmapram doses, but the interdose withdrawal was terrible.

Now I take:

- **50mg Diazepam**

- **3.5mg Clonazepam** 

- **2.75mg Diclazepam** 

a day. I calculated this as approximately **6.75mg Alprazolam Equivalent** a day after extensively researching Diclazepam's potency. I calculated **5.65mg Diclazepam = 1.0mg Diazepam** I used log(1/C) to calculate Diclazepam's potency. A link to this study is in the second edit.

Thank you for listening, I just needed someone to talk to. I have lurked this sub for a while, and now I want to participate. 

Goodluck my friends

Edit (8:07am): Formatted better

Edit (8:24am): To clarify the title I mean I am on **6.75mg Alprazolam Equivalent** not 6.75 bars. Sorry for any confusion, I haven't taken Alprazolam since early September.


Edit (8:34am): Added another study on Diclazepam potency. I used Sci-Hub to get past the wall

Edit (8:11am): I'm linking some studies I found on Diclazepam's potency because I know many people use Diclazepam to taper.

(Never even made it past .75 but I HAD  a low tolerance to these medications at the time) Since I was seventeen. But I always made sure to keep doses as low as effectively possible. However, for some reason, stomach problems arose. UNknown ailment, etc. Then suddenly I'm in the hospital treated for xanax withdrawal that had come with such and intensity that I thought I was gonna die. Turns out, my tolerance from zigzag dosing had shot up and now even my doubled dose was not easing the withdrawal. Then they pumped me with ativan after finding I had no more benzos in my system and I felt fine. But I felt the waves of withdrawal and anxiety and everything in the hospital so they kept pumping me with .5 round the clock.  


My detox doc has explained that my constant zigzaging even at the lower doses has thrown me for a loop. Theres a lot of stuff in the middle that I don't wanna bother explaining. He tried prescribing klonopin, and only one day did I feel okay enough to explore the outside world. But the sedation was too heavy and it kept feeling like I would need to go up and up and up. I wwas already at 4mg and it didn't seem enough. Or so I thought. So I told him that I wasn't comfortable and that it is impeding in my daily activities. He then said he had a choice of either prescribing Ativan or Valium instead. We went with the former because of my""positive"" experiencewith it in the past. However, I know it's intermediate acting and honestly. If Klonopin wasn't working out for me. I don't know what the hell will. I hate these drugs. I hate that they used to help. But they don't anymore.I wanna be okay but I don't know what the best approach is and we are looking for the optimum dose and drug for me to use to carefully LONG taper and then incorporate any other psychoactive med (SSRI's with a focus on Luvox)

Before running out of the purple or the RC's I went and got a hold of over 1500-1800 pressed xanax bars.

This went on and off throughout March-August until I was lucky to be admitted to a benzodiazepine tapering program. After 8 trips to the hospital not being able to walk or talk and explain to the doctor's, I was feeling SO helpless but I was lucky enough to have my fiancee find me the tapering program at a nearby hospital. 

Be careful with benzos, I went from being completely invalid to a functional human thanks to my fiancee and the wonderful Doctors and nurses at that hospital.

So a while ago I posted on here that I had taken a probiotic and that for some reason I had an overwhelming effect of calm, it literally felt like I took a valium. 
  This probiotic was pretty serious and had a lot of different strains.  I googled which strain was usually know for anti anxiety effects, and it said that Lactobacillus Rhamnosus. 
  Now I had stopped using this probiotic because it was actually making quite tired the next day after using it, I would use it in the evening randomly to relax before bed.
  I tried another probiotic but it‚Äôs time release formula made me even more exhausted the next day. So I figured I would just take the one strain probiotic, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus.  I found it online, swanson makes it. 
  I took one last night and had the WORST anxiety I‚Äôve had in a long time.  It felt like I had drank alcohol and had that same anxiety.  I could not sleep. 
  I have been researching how the gut biome is affecting the brain, there are a ton if articles covering this right now.  
  I am wondering if this Lactobacillus Rhamnosus is just a GABA antagonist and not raising GABA levels and that there was another probiotic strain that actually raises GABA levels. Although I don‚Äôt want to do these test trials on myself lol. 

I feel much better right now, I am drinking my coffee which I know people say stay away from but it actually calms me down and levels me out.

Hello,

I've been abusing benzos for about a few months now since a friend worked at a hospital and kept stealing them (xanax and valium etc).  
Then I moved back home where this friend isn't and I ordered 250 etizolam blotters since I wass getting alot of wd and hellish insomnia (sleeping 1-2 hours a day for weeks).

I dont really remember much of that entire month (yes, it was that bad.)

Anyway after the whole etizolam incident my smart ass decited to order 100 pills of 0.5mg clonazolam wich is alot more potent.

So I started taking them like a normal person (250ug up to 500ug a day and not every day)  
Ended up getting way too hooked and this last week I have been taking up to 2-3mg a day ( not every single day but I donmt know exactly. (sorry my memory is really fucked right now).

Anyway I ordered 100 blotters of 1mg diclazepam because ive read its good for tappering.  
It will take about a week to come and I am all out of clam. (took the last dose yesterday (2mg)).

How long will it take for wd from clam to begin and please help me create a tappering plan for the dicla.

how much mg a day should I start with? Should I take them every day? How frequentloy should I lower the dose and by how much?

Thank you anyone that will help, I know this is dangerous stuff so youre probably saving my life,",3,0

For atleast, I can say, 6-7 days I was at a constant 0.5mg maybe 3-6x a day dosage until the last 3 or so days has been a blur (and its where its truly gotten bad) because I really don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôve been taking due to measurement, and/or impulse issues. And also, stupidly, I‚Äôve put phenibut in the mix a few times in the first 6-7 days and in the last 3 days atleast 40-50mg baclofen, no more however. I haven‚Äôt completely realized I haven‚Äôt gotten much sleep and so I‚Äôve forced myself to sleep last night and feel slightly better today. The symptoms I am having are: loss of coordination, this strange head spinning/bouncing effect, panic, worried of what I may do to others or myself, but I‚Äôve gotten this under control and have warned anyone to take me into a detox if it gets bad enough. I almost did it last night. I had my two first real nightmares last night. My body feels... depersonalized? Or dissociated sometimes? It feels out of place. Paranoia. And an impending doom feeling at times. Not much anxiety? For some reason? But a high heart rate when in panic. Right now, I have diclazepam and I took the starting dose of 0.250mg to begin some sort of taper and its taken away the vertigo, a good portion of the panic, fixed my balance a little, has allowed me to get some sort of sleep, but I am however also able to force myself asleep without it, my mind just keeps waking back up. I feel about 60-70% functional, but don‚Äôt know how long it will last judging a variety of factors regarding the half-life of diclazepam. I am scared right now. I‚Äôm trying to stay strong and I know what I‚Äôve done is inexcusable. I am still somehow finding faith within this diclazepam stuff but I‚Äôm just not sure if its the right choice and it will burn me in the end. I have self control enough to taper because I‚Äôve done it before with phenibut and I genuinely never want to go through this again and I am taking nothing along the way besides what I have to take.

I say some, because the upsides do not make up for the downsides. For one, I did actually feel more relaxed and calm on them. You're probably thinking, duh, they're sedatives, but what I mean is that my mind was calm for the first time in ages. I didn't overthink things, my mind didn't wonder and race off, things that bothered me didn't matter anymore, and I didn't trail off into paranoia anymore. It was actually six months of relative bliss and I felt as though I did feel normal in a way. 

But of course, at the same I felt the cognitive decline and the intermittent withdrawals. Sometimes it would feel as though I probably needed a higher dose. I know that if I stay on these pills long term, I would probably be worse off than I was before. 

Now I've weened myself off from 2 pills a day, to one, to half, and am about to embark on just a quarter. It was a long haul, but I made it. The only downside to all of this is that the anxiety that was quelled is creeping back, as are the sometimes racing thoughts or paranoia. This is sporadic and isn't debilitating enough to do anything major about, I am just an overall anxious person who probably, most likely has GAD. 

But is there anything out there that they know about that can help where this pill left off? So far beta blockers have really helped me out the best and helped me ween off of these pills without major withdrawals, same with Zzzquil at night.

I figured I was only taking like 120 a month for a few years so it wasn‚Äôt really that bad and I didn‚Äôt need to address it.

Hardly felt anything. Was horribly depressed, anxious, had severe memory problems as well as other physical issues.

Wow, what a journey! I lost 3 years of my life (over 1 year tapering and nearly 2 years with PAWS). 

A bit of background, I was on and off Clonazepam (between 0.5mg and 2mg) for 6 years (kindled). After 3 failed tapers I was switched to diazepam and tapered off over several months.

I was in bad shape 1 year ago. Couldn‚Äôt work, do basic things like cook and clean, and could barely hold a conversation. Four months post jump I went into psychosis (visual and audio hallucinations). I was put on Haloperidol (2mg a day) and this resolved the hallucinations but also helped with the anxiety and insomnia. 

All of the symptoms gradually waxed and waned, and all that remains is the tinnitus. The anxiety, derealisation, boat feeling, insomnia, sleep paralysis, light and food sensitivities have all gone.

I lost a lot... my partner of 9 years left me, I lost my job, 2 close (or so I thought) friends, and had to go live on my mums couch. But I‚Äôve also gained a lot... a brand new mindset and fearlessness. I made some really good friends who accepted me when at my very worst. I‚Äôve begun exercising everyday.

It was also¬† begin to spread to other  places on my body and what I had was bad enough , but its beginning to  retreat now.  


The thing is this Eczema (Atopic dermatitis) is¬† an  Autoimmune Disease, which means the body has turned on it self and is  attacking it!  


Atopic dermatitis significantly associated with  several autoimmune  diseases https://www.healio.com/news/dermatology/20170202/atopic-dermatitis-significantly-associated-with-several-autoimmune-diseases.  


I  worked¬† it was possibly the Tea or¬† milk, causing it but was more  inclined it was the Tea after reading that¬† Caffeine¬† blocks to DAO  enzyme ( so do Benzos) that break down histamine, and not only that it  also raises glutamte , plus the soil¬† Coffee beans and Tea bushes are  gown in may also be rampant in Fluoride that the plants absorb so does  anything that absorbs the Caffeine form the plant too, Fluoride is a  Neurotoxin. There's also other chemicals besides Caffeine in these  plants that do shit to our system , and that's in a healthy non drug  user or Benzo damaged body and brain .  


So if its doing that  WTF else is it doing to us when we're already trying to mend damage? I  am now praying that the longer I am off this shit that I will see some  more improvement, as obviously it WAS causing damage, more than I  realized and it was probably holding me back from healing or at least  some minor or maybe bigger improvement in various symptoms even long  standing ones and creating more problems that I end up with an  Autoimmune disease?

 I look at withdrawal that way its as if we have some  autoimmune illness as its that bad and bloody Caffeine causes  Autoimmune illness plus other chemicals in the plants as well as  depending on what's in the soil they grew in?   


¬†My advice now?  Stop it ASAP. even people saying they only noticed minor adjustments  when they stopped may be missing a lot more healing after they stopped  than they realize,¬† I really believe that now, just because I still had  symptoms I had while drinking the Tea as I had before I started again  after not drinking Caffeine for 2 year's I believed that too, now I'm  wondering in 9 months how much more than I know did I shoot myself i the  head never mind in the foot!!!  


Who knows what progress I could  have possibly made this last 9 months as bad as I was I could be feeling  better by now and be more functional, now its going to probably take  longer than 9 months to recover from what I did to myself by using  Caffeine, yes using as its a psychoactive \*legal\* drug,¬† all that time  yet I'm too shit scared to take anything, and I'm in agony!! I'm even  scared to take the fkn Diazepam I take and I'm only taking that because I  have to taper off the evil shit!! !@##$%\^&\*()\_! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!

&#x200B;

I am a long term prescribed user, well over 20 year's, on Diazepam alone , tapering Diazepam  for the 4th and last time (Long story, not my fault  bloody Drs )  Was at 15mg now at 11.5mg, 61  in 11 days time, been on Benzos and poly drugged since my 20's  as kept getting misdiagnosed different ''illnesses''  regarding year's of then unbeknown tolerance withdrawal. 

 

Being CT'd  Benzos and other drugs after long term use by Drs I can't remember how many bloody times!!  put back on other Benzos doses put up an down, so kindled , was in tolerance withdrawal for over 10 year's , CT'd, took myself off lots of different high dose AD's and all sorts of opiate pain killers at high doses. Some I tapered right down, some I CT'd, and others I manged to taper and jump off at quite a high dose without too many problems .

 Longest and last Benzo and only drug I now take is the Diazepam I'm now tapering and my taper is brutal, but I am determined to get my life  back and live happily after decades of hell.  

Of course I get terrible times very often when I don't believe I'll ever get better, days when I truly think I'm having a brain hemorrhage or I'm seriously dying, or going to die before I  get off or heal as I have a lot of severe long term symptoms and have been housebound for quite a  while .  

But when it eases up a bit then my hope returns along with my determination to get the hell off, heal, get through whatever comes survive  and live a great life .  QP9‚ù§Ô∏è xxx

I have been taking between 0.5 - 2 mg of xanax each day for the majority of this year due to severe anxiety. I am also dealing with extreme adrenal fatigue, so I think some of the anxiety is mostly due to misplaced adrenaline. Lately I've been noticing I get VERY anxious around 18-24 hours after taking xanax (I only take it once a day), but I'm not sure if it's the xanax or the adrenaline/anxiety that comes with adrenal fatigue.

&#x200B;

Is this dose of xanax a cause for intense anxiety as a withdrawal symptom? I've also noticed irritability in the mornings and am having a terrible time sleeping, but these are also symptoms of adrenal fatigue so it's hard to tell what's causing what. I always (naively) thought that withdrawal symptoms only came with much higher doses. If this dose DOES cause withdrawal, any recommendations on how to deal with it? It's obviously not helping my already exhausted/wired but tired state. I guess I just want to know if it could be contributed to my heightened anxiety before I actually start worrying about LOL

Quick backstory. Started using alprazolam for insomnia caused by GBL use and used it every night for more than 18 months. Tried to taper a year ago without succes. Then i started using GBL daily from NYE and 7 months forward, resulting in an increased alprazolam usage, 2mg every night for sleep. 
Then tapered myself off the GBL and started tapering from alprazolam to diazepam. It went pretty ok with only mild wd‚Äôs and I‚Äôm happy to say that I have now ceased the benzo use, jumping from 2,5mg diaz 16 days ago. 
My sleep is pretty good most nights with the help of melatonin and promethazine and I just slept 10,5 hours this night. 

Now I‚Äôve been have some problems with my gut. I know tapering/quitting can give you digestion problems. Ever since i was in the last phase of tapering and efter quitting completely, I have had diarrhea after drinking wine. It was only the day after, which was acceptable as I know wine can also cause problems in the tapering phase.

I have been taking 0.5 of Clonazepam at night since around March/April this year. I was prescribed this to get me off Lorezepam, which I had been taking for about 14 months. This was originally given to me to combat anxiety/insomnia.

At the time that i started, i was foolish and followed the docs orders. Although they did help me sleep better, i really wish i had never touched them and combatted the issues in other ways.

While on Lorezepam I tried a few times (again foolishly) to quit abruptly on my own. Each attempt ended around day 3-4 after very little sleep, and the very little acheived being full of insane nightmares that i will never forget.

I came to realize, little by little, that these pills were draining my libido away. I originally thought that there was something else wrong with me, but sure enough, on day 1-2 after stopping takng each time, bang, it was straight back, which confirmed itself a few times over. I even asked doctors who had given me the pills if this could be the case, and for some reason (i am thinking pure lack of knowledge) they said to me simply no. I have since found countless accounts of people who have had the same experiences as me on that one.

Never more so is this true than with Clonazepam. When i am on this, sure, i am calmer and sleep better, but i lose interest in sex almost totally. I could litterally sit in front of the most provocative porn i can find, and not even be phased. Hell you could put me right inside the scenes and my brain would say no. Its like my brain has a switch that is turned off by the meds in question. I can not have this in my life anymore. I know full well that its the pills doing this to me. Ive proven it to myself as mentioned, multiple times.

Anyway, thats the background. Now over the space of around 3 months, which from what i read is a very short time, i am down to 0.25 a night. I will soon reduce that further.

My question is am i doing this properly? 

I have read the absolute horror stories on here regarding withdrawal and i know its no joke. Fact is that I am actually doing ok, yes some nights its hard to get to sleep, yes sometimes i get that ""i am anxious, but i have no idea why"" feelings out of nowhere. I just keep telling myself that its just my brain doing chemistry to try to get what its after (the pills) and that i am really all ok.

I had an updosing today and yesterday to 1.25mg of V (1/4 a pill) as I don't trust the solution I was taking and my sx were pretty severe.

Consider that I don't have access to a liquid form of Valium where I live, so it seems my options regarding tapering are reduced to a homebrew solution using the pill itself.

What I was doing before my updosing:

* I have a hermetical cup where I put a pill of 5mg of Valium;
* I add 50mL of water using a syringe;
* I shake it vigorously and put on the refrigerator;
* At the time of my dose, I was taking a syringe and dropping 3mL of the solution (after some shaking of the cup) in my mouth;
* I use a glass of water to use the same syringe a couple times to guarantee that I take all the content of those 3mL as I can sometimes see some V powder inside of the syringe.

&#x200B;

Ok, this solution might endure weeks and this brings me to one of the doubts below:

* Is it reasonable to consider this solution stable? I mean... can't Valium lose some of its properties when exposed at water?
* What about the duration of this solution? Can't a drop took after 2 weeks be with different properties compared to a drop from the same solution in the first week?
* Regarding the ideal method for when using a pill: I read sometimes about using alcohol... what form of alcohol should I use? Also, isn't alcohol a no-no refering to benzo withdrawal?
* Following the ideal methodology using a pill, be it with water only or alcohol, is it reasonable to say that it's equivalent, for example, taking 5mg of Valium and 50mL of the solution?

This is my first time posting and I guess I just want to vent but would also love some advice. Sorry this is going to be a long read. I just feel that I need to really get it all out there for once. 

I‚Äôve been abusing my klonapin prescription for about three years now. I have had some times where I‚Äôve gone a month without it, but that was just due to me not being able to get any. I moved to a different state and it took me a while to find a physician that would prescribe them. 

Well I eventually found a doctor that would prescribe them. But I ate them like candy, my prescription would be gone within 1 week. So I was in constant withdrawals, feeling fine, getting a refill, then withdrawals again, etc... 

When I first began to take them I knew I shouldn‚Äôt every day but I did anyway. At that point I would just take half at a time though and my prescription would last. I knew I that I shouldn‚Äôt be taking them so often but I felt I was taking them responsibly. 

I ended up in an abusive relationship and my usage has totally escalated since then. I will take about 5mg a day. I have gone through my prescription already. I just don‚Äôt want to be in my head, I don‚Äôt want to think about things. I would rather take the meds and forget that remember. 

I guess what I am trying to understand is if anyone else feels the same? I love the way the klonapin makes me feel. I feel more outgoing, confident, smarter, just everything feels better. 

When I take benzodiazepines I even get more chores done. I am more motivated. I feel like I am a better person on them. Although I know it is not healthy to take them it‚Äôs hard not to since I feel that I am better with them. 

Does anyone else really enjoy taking them? I know they are bad for me, and I do not want to take Ken anymore. I am just having a difficult time committing to quitting. 

I fantasize them. I love them. I love who I am when o take them. I even feel like I function better at work when I take them. 

Thank you to anyone who read all of that. I would love some feedback",2,0
