As far as benzos go, I was previously on Lorazepam (1mg/day) before my psych switched me to Xanax and got me up to 1mg 3x/day. **Altogether: I’ve been on (prescribed) benzos for a year, and 2-3mg total/day for a few months**.

Had a bad month and finished my pills too soon. Getting a refill in a few days, and I want to officially start a taper. Looped my doc in so he’d know I want to quit (I decided I want to quit when I went into withdrawals the past few days for the first time in my life…it’s awful), and wondering what you guys think of this tapering schedule once I get my refill? (I don’t think my doc will be willing to RX diazepam, so I’ll likely have to taper strictly with Xanax…)

• Since I’ll have been off it for 4-5 days before I get my script, I’m thinking I can start at 2mg/day for 2 weeks (I usually do 2-3mg/day…I’m not consistent with it) 

• After 2 weeks, drop to 1.75mg/day for 2 weeks.

• After that, 1.5mg/day for 2 weeks.

…etc, etc.

I don’t know if my doc will be helpful with tapering…as we know, not many docs are great when it comes to benzo W/D.

Thoughts on that schedule, given my history and current dose/being off Xanax for 4-5 days before starting the taper? I feel awful, I’m scared, and I just want to do this right. *Note: I’m on Xanax for bad anxiety, and that’s essentially it. I personally don’t use it recreationally.*

Back in June I accidentally withdrew from lexapro after taking it for 10 years (that was hell.) I was Rx ativan  .05 and it practically saved my life. Anyway, after two weeks of use I was pretty much fine no WD. Fast forward to November and I got COVID and was on a new birth control and my anxiety was insane. Took it for a month straight daily. (1mg). Was fine after a month and stopped. I recently had a procedure done and took 2 mg before and was fine until three days later when I had a massive anxiety attack. Now I can't go about my normal day without taking at least  .5.  Thank you for reading and my question is should I keep taking  .5 and jump? I'm going to consult with my doctor but I'm so stressed. I'm going on my first vacation in years with my bfs family in March and I don't want to feel this any more.. Just want to be me again. Any advice is so appreciated.

- Please try and avoid using street names as this shall assist the **helpful team** that we are understand you more (k-pins, vallies, bars, etizies, candy)

- Please tell us *exactly* what you are taking. In other words: be honest. Nobody shall **judge** you here. This includes other drugs/ medications which may have an impact on withdrawal such as alcohol 

- Please tell us the *exact* daily dose you are taking. This shall be hard if they are from their internet or street, so try to estimate and then write in your post that they are *street drugs*

- Please tell us how long you've been using. I can not **stress** this more. This is the fundamental reason that people have seizures. Length of use is more dangerous than amount taking. Who is worse:

1. *”I have been taking 120mg a day for a month and I have none left”*          
2. *”I take 40mg a day and have been for 6 years and I ran out”*

Number two, by a longshot. In fact, I'll prove there is no stigma on this sub: Number two is **me** and after about a month of withdrawal I had a massive seizure and was hospitalised for a week. I was extremely ill. It isn’t a competition, but length of usage has a huge impact on tapering

2022-01-29 17:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/sftb9j/depersonalizationderealization/,Depersonalization/Derealization,"Hi Everyone, I'd like to share a little of my story, and what I am currently experiencing.  I suffer from what is commonly referred to as ""Pure O"" OCD I have since I was 17 years old.  I'm forty six now.  For most of my adult life, I have managed my illness with SSRI's, exclusively.  At one time, they were very effective, but over the years they have pretty much pooped out.  I'm from the US, and back in 2016 I was living and working in Japan.  Things started to get really bad, so I returned to the US to try to get myself straight.  That was in August of 2016.  Back then, I was trying different anti-depressants, but nothing was helping.  I existed in a near manic state, where I was constantly agitated, very irritable, and felt like I was climbing the walls all the fucking time.  I couldn't sleep, and when I would go out to do things like go to the grocery store, I would feel very detached from reality.  I felt like I was living in a dream.  When I would speak to people, I would feel like it wasn't even me that was speaking.  Sometimes I found it hard to speak at all, and sometimes I didn't even recognize the sound of my own voice.  I felt completely disconnected from people, and from the external world in general.  It was a scary place to be in.  Having to experience the world in this way.  I had resisted the temptation to take benzos for as long as possible.  Finally, I got so fed up that I gave in, and asked my doctor for them.  I just wanted to sleep, and feel like my old self again.  I was desperate.  I was prescribed 1 mg of klonopin taken twice daily.  I quickly realized that I could get by on 0.5 taken once daily.  It helped me to keep functioning.  I felt like I had no other choice.  I knew that it was a Faustian bargain, that I was only kicking the can further down the road, and that I was avoiding dealing with the problem.  Last summer, I hit a wall.  I had pretty much reached tolerance.  I did not want to go up in dosage, and I was afraid to go off.  I have managed to get by without changing anything until about three weeks ago.  I started using the water titration method to taper.  My doctor was, and has been useless.  He wanted to taper me much more rapidly, but I knew from some of the posts on here how horrifically difficult this was going to be, and I did not want to assume that I was going to be one of the lucky ones.

So from January 7th I started tapering using water titration.  I posted on this subreddit sometime back in December asking for advice, and that was how I found out about it. I dissolved the tablet in 200MLs of water, and started removing 1cc per week.  When I got to 0.46, I started to notice a difference.  The depersonalization/derealization stuff started coming back.  Not quite as intensely, but it is definitely there. Nevertheless, I forged ahead, and reduced the dose by another cc.  I have been on 0.45 mg for ten days, and I plan on staying here for another twenty, and then I will start reducing 1cc per week at a time.  I went into the taper with the mindset that I didn't, and don't care how long it takes to get off of this shit, even if it takes years, and that I was going to give my body/brain plenty of time to adjust.  I tell myself that every reduction, no matter how miniscule is still a reduction, and is still progress, and that is ultimately a good thing.  I told my doctor what I was doing last week, and he didn't believe I have noticed a difference between 0.5 and 0.45.  I guess he thinks I'm full of shit.  It is extremely frustrating how doctors can be so dumb, and cavalier when it comes to prescribing, and tapering off of these drugs.  Anyway, this is where I am.  I wonder if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and specifically had to deal with depersonalization/derealization returning once they started to come off their meds?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67055047}"

I’m already addicted to marijuana and becoming an alcoholic (again). I take so many prescription drugs too. At this rate, I’m not even me anymore. 

Currently I take adderall 20mg (used to be 40mg for like 6 years), lamotrigine 400mg, cymbalta 20mg (I think?), lexapro 20mg, birth control, and clonazapem 1mg as needed. Even I know that’s excessive but my psychiatrist thinks that’s what I need, lol.

I lost multiple 6 figure jobs. I would end up hanging out with random criminals in Kensington, Philadelphia doing crazy shit.

I didn't like who I had become and I was disgusted.

I skipped my psychiatrist appointment, bought 10 bars on the ave and decided that was it and I'd have to make due. I basically took 2, then 1 for two days, half for four days, then progressively broke them down into tinier and tinier pieces until I was down to like 1/6 to 1/8th of a bar, then I just stopped. Now, thankfully I literally had no responsibilities and was unemplpyed, so I was able to spend all day, every day in my room. I've basically developed a way of using sleep to get through withdrawal whether I wake up every 5 minutes or every few hours, I simply surrender to the idea that I have no money, nothing to sell, no way nor desire to get more and there's no point of being lucid or awake, so I just lay in the dark closing my eyes thinking about blackness and as long as it's cold enough, I have a loud box fan to drown out all noise and my windows are covered with blankets I can usually get about 15-16 hours a day for weeks doing this. Unlike opiate withdrawal I don't get restless leg syndrome or bugs crawling under my skin on benzo withdrawal which I'm grateful for, however, the main things I get are extreme body temperature irregulation, inability to walk up/down steps, extreme paranoia/pschosis/hallucinations/night terrors and seizures in my sleep where I wake up wit my entire shirt SOAKED in drool. I generally wake up every hour after having TERRIFYING night terrors that always involve people from my life and situations where I'm being forced to take losses and when I wake up I'm freaked out, so I smoke a cig, take a piss, go out into the warmer house for a minute and return to my way colder room which gives me an oddly satisfying goosebump feeling where I dive under my covers and go back to my mental gymnastics - I repeat this ritual and usually around 8 PM every 2 days my stomach is growling so hard I can finally eat a meal, so I'll temporarily distract myself with that and back to the adventure. I turn my phone off, interact with nobody and luckily my mom/brother let the dogs out and stuff. After 4 weeks I began feeling a lot better, my physical symptoms turn more into a constant runny nose, my psychosis reduces to just exteme anxiety that was bad enough for me to skip 5 job interviews even though I desperately needed a job, I just told myself I'd lose it anyway without this step. The night terrors persisted but the sleep turned to 3-4 hour blocks. At this time, I was lucky enough to get back on my Adderall (60MG/day) which I've taken off and on for 15 years, but the Xanax ruined the awesome orgasms and extreme energy/focus it gives me, so this totally boosted my entire outlook and I began looking for a job 12 hours a day, masturbating most of the rest of the time and before I knew it, 4.5 months has gone by. I don't think about benzo's or have ANY desire to go back to the sucker I'd become. This is an extremely unique exit strategy developed over many years of drug abuse and sobriety plus knowledge of self and the ability to manipulate my psyche but I did it and you can too.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73303264}"

My medical records will show multiple failed attempts of getting off benzos and ER vists and abuse of Clonozolam It will also show I tested positive for ketamine.

Depression on the other hand is soul crushing, I’m not sure if this is just benzo depression or what, but I feel like a sad little cloud just follows me around.

I am s happy to be working again and kicking real ass.  I'm a productive person again.  My tinnitus is going away, my heart doesn't pound at all unless I'm seriousg exerting myself lifting 40+ lbs for an hour straight which I'm doing.  I wasn't used to standing for 8 hours let alone lifting and pulling and toting.  I am so fucking proud of myself.  I worked 6 hours today on the clock and came home and took care of all the weekend chores so I'm just a weekend to celebrate with my aunt.

I just wanted to post this to anyone discouraged or scared.  I had horrific withdrawals but today at 30 Days I honestly feel great.  I have tons of strength and stamina.  I ate about 2 lbs of food today and in actually keeping a good weight of 200 lbs at 6"" 1"".  I'm getting good money and expenses are low because I'm just sober and all I spend money on is food and a few bills.  No monkey on my back...  anyways that's all.

Ps I als have the lowest anxiety I've had in years and I'm sleeping really good.  Still taking fish oil, valerian 2x a day and ashwandha and 1 benadryl at night with melatonin.  I am sleeping 7-9 hours a night with 1 wakeup in the middle to piss so I really can't complain.  All systems are go and like I said I havnt felt this good in a long time.

*** Update **** New day 24:

So today is 10 days later.  My post at day 12 is below. I Havnt picked up a drink (because I'm bat shit scared to literally rekindle or step backwards) nor a pill in 24 days.  I must say things are really turning the corner.  

I'm starting a new job the day after tomorrow on Monday.  I did 2 separate interviews and I must've done something right although I had massive F-ing headaches I still pulled them off somehow.  

I have so much more energy I actually worked out today.  Eyes no longer hurt and headaches are subsiding.  My heart isn't going crazy and anxiety is low.  All I have are some eye twitches and eye tension if I stare at screens too much.  I've been eating really well and put in about 30 lbs of muscle.  I'm 6 foot and 190 pounds 36 athletic male.  I can feel my body getting stronger.  I can feel the beautiful testosterone flowing again.  I was so happy to workout today.  I was so happy not to have to take a pill to feel good today.  I feel free of the chains that are addiction ... I no longer need a doctor or pharmacy or some pill to dictate my life.  My costs are super low right now.  I have so much more time in the day to do things.

I just detoxed 24 days ago and I figure I'd post an update to you guys.  I jumped off a pretty high dose and I still havnt had any seizures.  I've been sleeping a lot at night and trying to stay busy in the day.  

I'm not sure if I would've made it without the love of my family.  I was shaking and crying, delirious begging her to take me to hospital so they would give me more pills around day 7-9 and she said no your gonna sweat it out and I shook and sweated and she just held me while I shook and cried and sweated so she really helped.  My memories are returning in bits and fragmented pieces but my mind is clearing up and I'm remembering my life again.  I was a sad sack of shit on those pills.  I'm getting my life together.  I now have a new car, new job, house is clean, clothes are clean, ate 4 meals today I really cannot complain and I'm hoping that mabye this can be a positive message for anyone reading. 

 I'm a deranged drug addict and it's always all or nothing and if I can give this up anyone can.  Week 1-2 really was awful.  Week 3 started subsiding but headaches were constant.  Eye pain constant.  Now all that is lingering is tinnitus, little eye twitching and a little brain fog but it's lifting fast and I'm feeling like 80% normal.  

I hope you have a great weekend.  Much love to you all!  

Ps -Try not to let all the horror stories scare you because they will make your anxiety so much worse.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.  Now that I'm on the other side I feel almost invincible.  I feel stronger because it didn't kill me.  


Old Post ‐‐------

My old post at Day 12 if you hadn't seen it give some more vital information into this while crazy process.

Well I was down in South America with my father and he died.  Started taking 20 mg clonazepam and 6-10 of alprazolam w/ codeine about a year ago.  Quit the codeine first, then came home to America two months ago.  Of course I knew my dose was unsustainable and brought back 150 clonazepam and tapered that to 2 mg.  Tried to jump and was coping with alcohol and thought it was helping.  I didn't have any seizures but I did end up in tbe hospital once with a super rapid taper and then again a week or two later.  Did a quick 90 lorazepam in a month, tapering then I binged the last week.  Thank God they gave me a week of gabapentin.  So for the jump I was down to anywhere between 2-6 mg lorazepam.  I've come off IV H and dilaudid several times.  It's 3-4 days then you get better.  

I wanted to throw my 2 cents in.  Everyone says switch to a long lasting benzo but I don't think that's great and I'll say why.  If you've ever come off H or methadone you'll know H is short and strong and methadone takes weeks of sickness.  I'd rather be sick hard for a week or two than sick for a month or two.  Lorazepam, I'm on day 12.  I had all the classic symptoms, anxiety, heart palpitations, insane blood pressure, sweating... still sweating a lot, I even had a bit of psychosis / delirium.  At day 12, it's calming down.  I slept 7 hours last night, and I will do it again tonight.  

Trying to stay busy in the day helps, eating good, vitamins, valerian, ashwagandha all had helped.  2 benadryl at night with some super sleep caps herbal and some goodbye stress l-theanine and some neuriva brain supplements and fish oil I am healing.  Now I found that if you read all this, I came off 20 mg clonazepam and up to 10 mg alprazolam for almost a straight year.  If you need hope here is hope fr you.  I HAVNT had a seizure.  I did have Los of psychosis and delirium but you have to keep yourself focused on the end goal.",12,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.88671905}"

Started get shakes, palps, tremors, frequent panic sttacks, etc. Still had good days early on,, but made the mistake of taking another Ativan when another PA hit. No idea what was going on or that I could be making it worse. Finally learned about benzo withdrawal. CT for just over a week now.

TLDR posted at the end.

Posting for the first time, been following this sub for a while. A bit long post, , started benzo (mainly RC) and it was etiz last year in August, people on RC forum had convinced me it's the least addictive one.. clearly wrong there. Anyways fast forward to end of November, I was taking daily dose close to 30mg and started off with 1-1.5mg.

Came December and realized my life had became a mess. I should also add I'm on ADHD meds as well (prescribed and been on them for almost 10 years). My meds stop working (obviously realized it after as benzo counteracts it), so productivity level at work, home,  and everything else dropped. Once realized, decided to read on tapering method. I wanted to follow Ashton's method but with covid/job/mortgage, wasn't really the option. Took couple weeks off and managed to get down to 6-7mg a day (btw I switched to longer acting one, diclazapam). It's super aggressive I know. Withdrawals were horrible, body aches, blood pressure super high (which I controlled with proporanal). Soreness all over and had even collapsed multiple times due to soreness (no seizure though).

Now January back to work so decided to slowly go down but yet weekends I would try reducing by 1mg or slightly above. Last Wednesday I got down to 1.5mg, heck don't feel any sides so Friday dropped to 1mg. Again body soreness.. which I can handle now.. now here's the problem, comes Monday I can't sleep all night. So next night I increase the dose back to 1.5mg and sill can't fall asleep. So ended up increasing to 4mg in total. Yesterday similar situation, and today it's even worse. Still up and have taken just around 5mg. 

Do you think it's rebound anxiety causing that? Any suggestions would be helpful, please don't bash as I already feel down on my progress. Oh and forgot to mention, I would monitor my blood pressure and heart rate throughout. Readings won't be constant, some day normal and some day high but nothing crazy like 160+/100+,  Sorry for long post. And right now it's 2AM, still up.

TLDR: introduced to RC benzo etiz back in August of last year, started with 1-1.5mg, slowly led to 30mg a day in November. Decided to come off, took a fast taper route and by end of December was down to 6-7mg a day. January wanted to go slow but still went fast, last weekend reached 1mg, started having sleep issues on Monday, and past 3 nights increased dose slowly to 5mg. Oh and I've been on ADHD meds for past 10 years.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71921694}"

I use it at the end of the day only to help me calm down for sleep. Initially I used it as need about 3 days a week and would just struggle through with not as great of sleep the other days of the week. Eventually it got to be almost every day, at which point about 2 months ago I asked my Psychiatrist about Ambien and got a script for that, and started using Ambien (10mg) on the days I didn't use Xanax. Then over about the last month I have found myself needing both some xanax (usually just 1mg) and ambien (10mg) at night for some nights. The xanax I would take a bit earlier than the ambien.

About 2 weeks ago I really started realizing that I have become dependent on these drugs because I started noticing interdose withdrawal effects toward mid-day / afternoon that would go away if I take xanax. This is what really woke me up and made me realize I need to get off these things instead of starting to up my dosage to adjust.

So, I did like 4 or 5 days without any xanax at all, and just used the Ambien to be able to get a few hours of sleep. I use a lot of THC (inhaled and edibles) and these also helped some. Mostly those 4 or 5 days really sucked, I was a wreck during the day and could barely operate and physically my body just felt very tense / hard to breathe. Those days made me think I should switch to Valium and do a taper from that.

I have valium in 10mg pills, enough to get me through the slow Ashton Manual taper starting from 20mg Valium. I've already done the switchover (only did like 2 days of both some valium and xanax) and am now on 5mg Valium at \~10pm, 15mg valium at \~1am. This is comfortable (ish) to me already and I am managing to get some sleep. I still use some high dose THC edibles as well.

FYI: I have gone through this Benzo addiction issue once in my past- 8 years ago. I was on 3-4mg xanax at that time AND drinking HEAVILY. I got sober from all of it by going to an in-patient 30 day rehab facility (well, I was released still on Valium but on the Ashton taper so it took many months, I succeeded and stayed away from benzos for years - I specifically found a rehab willing to do the Ashton method). Thankfully I still do not drink alcohol so that is not compounding this issue this time.

Considering the meds I was on and dosages, and the fact that I feel OK already at 20mg valium, should I just try to Cold Turkey from benzos right now? On my mind is that I could rotate in the Ambien for a 2-3 nights of the first week just to get some sleep after I have struggled through a day, and just barely sleep the remaining days of that first week...

Was cutting out the Ambien as a first step a sound decision? I know that stuff can be hell to get off too.

Or is the smarter thing to do to stick to the valium taper? Maybe go to 15mg tonight already and taper from that?

I WISH I NEVER RELAPSED WITH BENZOS. However, I am glad that I understand these meds so much better this time around and am not just seeking to up my dosage or anything. My past is proof that I can do this. I just wish there were a bit of a shortcut this time around. Given my dosage wasn't super high and I was rotating drugs makes me wonder if I truly have that bad of a dependence / what level of it is just in my head?",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48462263}"
2022-01-27 23:35:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/sei8he/day_14_of_klonopin_coldturkey_after_3_months_of/,Day 14 of Klonopin Cold-Turkey After 3 Months of Prescribed Use (Cautionary Tale),"Yep - I knew better and I did it anyways. I didn't realize I was experiencing withdrawal until it climaxed on day 10, otherwise I would have called my psych to start a gradual taper. By then, I was too traumatized to risk ever taking another dose again, for fear of rekindling the withdrawal or prolonging it. I know - it's a terrible reason not to appropriately withdrawal from the substance. Do the opposite of what I did, and spare yourself some trauma and a potential trip to the ER, or worse.

Took 1mg+ daily, and gave myself only about a week of ""tapering"" to 0.25mg before jumping :/ I did not coordinate it with my psychiatrist.

Days 1-10 hit my GI system hard (I have gastroparesis, so don't take this as a sign that you'll go through the same!). Woke up every morning at 7am to vomit/heave until 10:30am, with my appetite lessening every day. Got linearly worse each day until day 10.

Days 10 & 11 were my climax, wherein I experienced everything from intense cold-sweats and delirium/hallucinations, to ""vomiting"" in a trash-bag on my bf's bed every 15 mins or so. I have only flashbulb memory of this 30hr hellblaze. Couldn't hold down any water or gatorade, and was fasting for 3 days at that point. If my partner and I weren't out-of-state, I would have had him drive me to Yale Hospital, despite how demeaning the staff is to people in these situations. I haven't vomited since this phase turned around on night 11.

Today (day 14) is the first day since day 7 that I've been able to consume over 300 calories :)

Since then, I've been in the ""windows and waves"" phase, with each day getting gradually better. The only symptoms that persist are: physical anxiety at random (usually AM), and those brain fog/memory issues. Like the first few times you use THC, but everlasting. I'm not an addict, so I'm fortunately not dealing with any cravings or need to use, despite having it around. My heart goes out to those of you who have to deal with that in addition to the physical wackiness.

Moral of the story: don't assume that you are a low-dose or short-term user, and therefore not at risk of seizures or hellblaze. Stick to your doctor's plan to gradually taper. If you can't, you need to check yourself in.

You can check my post history. I had left benzos on December 18th. I was on a taper schedule, I had been taking 1.5mg Klonopin a day for 10 days and then 1mg a day for 8 days and then frustrated from the tapering,I impulsively left them on December 18th. 

I’m in a similar situation right now. 8 days ago, despite popular opinion on this sub, and my parents and doctors opinion,I reinstated benzos for it was hell. I could not get a drink have a laugh or anything. So I begged my doc to reinstate (who is not totally aware of protracted withdrawal symptoms; she thinks I was out of withdrawal in the first 14 days). 

I was put back on 0.5mg klonopin a day after going through a month of cold turkey. 0.25 in the morning and 0.25 in the night. In 3 days I am supposed to taper it to 0.25mg a night for 10-12 more days. But I’m sick of it. I’m sick of having medicine, sick of visiting a psychiatrist, sick of being a patient, who’s totally mentally fine but still visits a psych for no valid reason. I’m mentally fine (no doctor has EVER ma diagnosed me with a valid mental illness, except for when I diagnosed myself with anxiety and doctors agree, for they need patients). My psychologist says I don’t have anxiety, it’s only me who says that I do .I treat myself like a mentally ill patient by visiting a psychiatrist.

I don’t wish to continue this taper anymore.

Truth be told, I feel dumb. I feel so much dumber when I’m tapering benzos compared to when I’m abusing them or not on them at all. I feel like my intellect is dead, like it’s not sharp anymore. Having a sharp intellect is being prone to anxiety but knowing that the cost of treating that anxiety from doctors, is losing my sharp analytical edge. (I repeat, the cost of treating my mild anxiety from medicine, is losing tha my sharp analytical edge) I’d rather not go at all. I would have and I did accept this cost some 6-7 years ago but no more.

It’s like I’m trying to turn myself into a robot to conform to society’s rule and way of life than being who I really am.

Anyhow all of my feelings aside, I have this 0.25 klonopin in front that I’m supposed to take. And then 2 times again tomorrow and then 2 more times the days after that and then once a day after that for 10 days.  

Should I take this 0.25mg in front of me, or should I say fuck it, fuck the doctors, fuck my anxiety and start living my life on my own terms? It won’t be easy but what in this short life, worth having is ever easy?!",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65162486}"

It says ""A fascinating symptom in patients undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal is that they often mention the occurrence of what seem to be intrusive memories. Their minds will suddenly conjure up a vivid memory of someone they have not thought about or seen for years [...] The interesting thing about these memories is that they often start to occur at the same time that vivid dreams appear"". How oddly specific.






Isn't that funny! One dream was about a friend of a friend who is a relatively well known DJ / producer, and I woke up being totally convinced that I had to Whatsapp him about doing a jam session. I haven't seen this guy in years, and although I think he'll remember me the thought of doing a jam session with him is kind of absurd. The second dream wasn't so specific, and about a female I was quite fond of in uni, who I haven't seen for at least 15 years, and after waking up I was convinced I had to get in touch over LinkedIn, again pretty absurd.

Maybe I'm just in a bad wave but my symptoms are awful. I know this process is not easy, which is why I put it off for so many years. Would it be just as bad on diazepam? I know crossing over to diazepam is very popular on this sub but my doctor is willing to go extremely slow on clonazepam. We cut those .125 mg ODT tablets. 

Lately I've been dealing with dizziness (that rocking on a boat feeling), sensitivity, derealization, brain fog, poor sleep and maybe depression. Those last three kind of blend together. So I take .75 mg in the morning and 1 mg at night. I've taken 1 mg at night for the whole 13 years. What I mean by blend together is sometimes I feel depressed or like I got crappy sleep and once I take my night dose, I feel better. Other times it really is crappy sleep and the night dose doesn't help much.

I know there can be crappy side effects crossing to diazepam, so if I'm still gonna have the symptoms above, is it worth it?

Also, how long should the crossing over process be? My doctor is pretty experienced so I'm sure he'd switch one dose at a time but what's a conservative time frame? Thanks.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5809416}"

It is going MUCH better than trying to cut our Xanax alone, but I’m so desperate to get off the meds and start trying to get pregnant. My therapist and OBGYN have both suggested getting on an SSRI starting now (zoloft as it’s most safe for pregnancy) but I feel so scared of medication.

I haven’t missed a day. I also rarely, RARELY go over. Typically only when traveling as I still have a good deal of travel anxiety.

I know this might not be much at all compared to so many success stories I’ve seen. But I’m still scared, to be frank. I fear I cannot deal with those panic attacks and the mental hell that sticks with them again. The Xanax has helped, undoubtedly. I could easily take much more a day, as 2-3 mg is virtually unnoticeable at this point other than reduced anxiety. But being in benzodiazepines for all my life is the absolute last thing I want to do.

Sorry for the long post but its time I finally vent about this.


Hello everyone, Sadly posting the same story I did 2 years or so ago when I first beat benzo addiction. 
To preface, The first time I successfully quit, I had been through a bunch of different RC bzds's, and ultimately ended with alprazolam 1mg which I jumped off CT due to court ordered drug test, And was successful and clean for 6 months, With the wd's being bad but ultimately i got through them and was still working at the job i had at the time on day 3, It was doable.
Ofcourse, my fucking dumbass got readdicted to the chems once I got off probo, a single ""im off dose"" Turned right back into the addiction I had before, and now fast forward to today, i am back in the same spot. 


My dosage currently where I can be comfortable throughout the day is 1.5mg flubromazepam, Emphasis on the PAM, i do NOT mean flubLAM. I know this dose is low but im assuming due to my first round with this shit is why my wd's seem to get much worse then when I jumped off xanax, I tried completely stopping already and only lasted a day with shakes getting quite violent. It's been a multi year battle of this for me where I've only taken them for maintenance 90% of the time, taking the least amount i need to just feel normal. The other 10% of the time, If even that much I would seek out recreational effects, Which it has been awhile since doing so, with my stash dwindling for awhile now inspiring me to taper down fast and low to now.


Im so goddamn fucking tired of this. I have two degrees, Recently graduating with my dream degree, and I obviously feel like I cannot do anything until getting clean due to Pre-employement DT's, and in general going through this cycle. I also want to emphasize that I have kept my dependence/addiction completely to myself this whole time other then the therapist I worked with in court (Was in trouble due to alcohol, But DT's were included hence them finding the benzos in my system), and a seperate therapist who I saw independently. Other then that, I have never revealed to anyone in my life what I'm going through even when going through my CT withdrawals while living with my ex gf. Now i'm at the point where Im ready to tell my mom (who I still live with, again recently graduating), Who i'm hoping will be somewhat understandable as she is a recovering alcoholic, and works in the medical field. My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and I feel absolutely fucking terrible having him find out about this right now, He is not the understanding type about this stuff either. My now current girlfriend is one of the most amazing human beings Ive known, and im also terrified to now lose her.


I need guidance on what to do about getting on a doctor supervised taper. I am terrified of getting sent to inpatient when I know I can function as a human being in soceity as I have for the past couple years while tapering them down repeatedly. I know with a doctors help that taper would actually end instead of getting to a low dose and maintaining there. I dont know how that all works and what is stopping me is going to the doctor for help, and getting sent to inpatient involuntary, and my whole life crashing around me with my whole family finding out as well as friends and girlfriend and yea im sure that part makes sense. Im looking for any advice on how to go about this with the doctor, And even if it seems silly if anyone has any advice on how to go about telling this all to my mother.


I should highlight the fact I have 3-4 days left of fpam to take, 3-4 as im sure i could lower my dose even more to stretch out my supply, but this is why this is like a ""coming to jesus"" moment where I'm ready to get doctors supervision and tell atleast one family member. Ive stayed away from ordering more as I cant take this anymore and want the cycle to end more then anything, Truly. Any help is appreciated.

I know this, because it’s exactly what I did over and over again until around the six-month mark of my sobriety from Benzos. That’s when I started to notice some of the physical pains easing and mentally, I began having hope that the years I spent as a prisoner to one of the worlds most dangerous drugs would become a distant memory. Although I still have a whole lot of healing to do, I can officially say today, with full confidence, that I’ve woken up from the nightmare of Benzodiazepine addiction. I am strong, I am proud, I am sober, I am healthy, and most importantly, I am happy!

 Having been through the throes of a cold turkey Benzo withdrawal, one which almost took my life, I will forever feel a duty to help protect others from falling into the same dangerous trap. Here are a few key reminders I’d like to share:

·    Benzodiazepines should be prescribed for a maximum of 6 weeks, usually while the patient is adjusting to an SSRI or SNRI. (my doctor prescribed them to me for three years, encouraging three times daily use.)

·    Benzodiazepines can be prescribed for both anxiety/sleep disorders and seizure disorders. The maximum dosage differs depending on what they are taken for. (my doctor prescribed me over the maximum adult limit for panic disorder, crossing into the dosages for a seizure disorder, which I did not have.)

·    Different Benzodiazepines have different chemical reactions and potency levels, as well as different half-lives. This is incredibly important, as it later affects the withdrawal process. (my doctor prescribed me the most potent, long-lasting Benzo: Clonazepam.)

·    Protracted withdrawal after six months of Benzo use is highly probable.  This means withdrawal symptoms can seem to end for a few days, then come back full force. The come and go symptoms can happen for several months after stopping use completely. (I can tell you from experience that this happens, and it is awful!)

·    If/when your physician begins to prescribe you Benzodiazepines, they should tell you about the risks of use, the risks of dependency, the risks of withdrawal, and go over a taper plan with you, usually referencing to the Ashton Manual. (my doctor did not do any of this with me. Not on day one, not after six weeks, not a year in, not two years in, and not when she pulled them completely.)

·    If you are already taking Benzo’s and are considering discontinuation, ALWAYS do a very, very slow taper. If you don’t have the option to taper, ALWAYS go to the emergency room and ask about local detox centers.  It may be difficult to overdose on Benzodiazepines, but it is not difficult to die during a cold turkey withdrawal.

Know your rights before seeing any doctor. Research all medications before beginning to take them. Stand up for your mind and body and remind yourself, that just because a physician is more highly educated than you, doesn’t mean that they know what is best for your mind, body, and life. They are people too, who are just as capable of making mistakes or being neglectful. More often than not, primary care doctors are the ones prescribing psychiatric medications, which is not their specialty. Between the lack of education on the topic and time they have for appointments, overprescribing happens far more often than it should. But the reality is, we have the final say over what we take or don’t take.  Our best chance to avoid these life-threatening situations is to stay educated and aware.  If anyone ever needs to talk or has questions, I am here for you!

Stopped all Xanax use two Tuesdays ago (January 11th) during the early afternoon. Prior to that, I had used 0.125mg on Tuesday, 0.125mg on Monday, 0.25mg on Sunday and 4mg or more prior. I always used alparozolam intranasally and have been consistently using approx. 4 mgs daily for about 2.5 years.  

I do have some medical issues--including endocrine issues that might make my body hold onto things longer. For detox, I used gabapentin three times (once at 800 mg and the other two uses close to 400 mgs each) and some clonidine during the first few days. 

At this point, my symptoms are still kinda all over the place, but I feel like I'm starting to get better in a bunch of ways, but I'm still hypersensitive with all of my senses to the point it's scary. 

I could go into pages long of additional detail, but it comes down to--am I through the most dangerous part of my detox?? I have been saying it now for a little bit, but I'm going to be stopping fent and should be making the final jump tomorrow and I'm curious if this is just setting myself up to inevitable disaster (like it was when I tried to quit both at once in the beginning of January).  I do have about 80mg of methadone, plenty of gaba, plenty of clonidine, some benadryl, some imodium and some ambien. If anyone has any advice on how to approach this, I'm all ears. 

Also worth noting, I need to be able to pass a random supervised urine in the near future. I'm trying to get admitted to a program for outpatient methadone in case if I don't make it through this detox as soon as possible, but I think it's another 2 week wait (as long as I didn't come up positive for benzos when I took my test last Friday). I THINK the drug test doesn't even test for fent, but does test for methadone so I'm insanely scared that I'm going to start this detox using methadone and then get notice I need to take the drug test immediately...in which case my only backup is that my patient portal shows methadone as an active prescription currently. 

Any advice about whether I'm through the most dangerous part of detoxing and how to maximize my chance of getting through all of this and being as close to healthy as possible would be extremely appreciated. Thanks.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5269207}"

I have a whole host of other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, headaches, eye pain, light sensitivity etc

But my paranoia is sending me spiraling on a daily basis

In Oct 2021 I went from 1.25 klonopin straight to .5 mg… I had to reinstate because of how bad the physical got (falling, spasming in my throat so I was aspirating good into my lungs, spasms in my urinary track backing urine into my kidney etc)

I reinstated to 1.25 in November 2021 until that dose stopped working- so I started a slow taper

I know this is totally lame and pathetic but even this wildly slow water taper is kicking my ass!

The brain fog and confusion is bad enough; however, I’ve started developing odd totally unlike myself feelings for a friend? Or something of that short- which is not so cool because tbh we are both not doing so well and I think I may be reading way too much in to it

Regardless; I am constantly paranoid that I am being manipulated and lied to- I am questioning everyone’s (every single person I know) motives AND WORSE YET is that I care so much about it: WTF this is so so far from who I am: I do not care about this shit usually.  I don’t question myself-or care to question others 
..and I do not typically care about people so quickly 

And now I’m this mess

I need to hop off the paranoia train because it’s bad enough without having to constantly question who I am and what others mean to me 

Or I mean look I am even spiraling as it is in these sentences. 

I just need to turn off the emotions lol the physical crap is bad enough 

I am constantly dizzy, lost all sense of time and what I’m supposed to be doing and when .. headaches and nausea.. shaky and tense

I need to get some control over some of this shit. I’d like to start with the paranoia lol because it is causing unnecessary anxiety leading to agh idk

1.25 mg per day for 5 days

2022-01-24 16:42:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/sbxdic/advice_on_klonopin_taper/,Advice on Klonopin taper,"Hi there, I've been on (prescribed) klonopin in some capacity for anxiety for a decade (sometimes 0.5mg as needed roughly 2-3x a week, sometimes 1mg 3x a day for long stretches). I haven't really had huge issues going down in dosage in the past, even for sustained periods of months or years, but (except for I think two times of \~6 months each), I never came off completely (and I don't remember what I did re tapering on those occasions, just that my anxiety eventually became so unbearable that I ended up going back on it).

I've been on a consistent dose of 0.5mg 2x a day (once in the morning and once at night) for roughly three years now. A little over a month ago, I stopped my morning dose, so I've just been taking 0.5mg at night before bed. I know about the Ashton method, I know how intense tapering can be if not done really slowly, and I know, while not a huge dose, 0.5 of klonopin is still fairly high, so I don't really have a good reason as to why I stopped my morning dose completely rather than cutting it in half or asking my doctor for diazepam and doing a slower taper, but I did.

I didn't notice any increase in anxiety at first. In fact, I felt happier, more excited about stuff in my life, even calmer. That continued to be the case until now. Yesterday and today I've felt much more anxious than usual (mostly physical symptoms, not really racing thoughts or anything). Nothing in my life changed right before this. The past few days have been the same as usual in terms of what I do and what's happening around me.

My question is whether this is likely related to the drop in klonopin and what I should do moving forward. I know klonopin has a long half life, but from everything I've read, you should feel acute withdrawal effects a few days after stopping, and they should peak after about two weeks. It's been almost five weeks since I stopped my morning dose, so it seems strange that I'm feeling this anxiety backlash now. I'm very tempted to start taking my morning dose again, or at least a fraction of it, but since I made it over a month, I also don't want to add more klonopin when my goal is to eventually come off of it completely (and stay off of it).

Has anyone had a similar experience of feeling pretty great after a dose reduction only to have fairly intense anxiety pop up over a month later? Does it make the most sense to ride it out rather than upping my dose? (Semi-relatedly): Assuming I stay at my current dose of 0.5mg of Klonopin once a day before bed, would it be a bad idea to continue my taper using only klonopin? I know the general advice is to switch to diazepam, but I'd rather just stay with klonopin as long as that isn't a horrible idea.

(Just to be clear, I've talked with my doctor about tapering in the past, and he's given me the go ahead to do it when and how I'd like based partially on the fact that he doesn't feel like 1mg in a divided dose is that high of a dose -- I know that isn't necessarily the case. He's of the opinion that it isn't necessary to switch from klonopin to diazepam, and that dropping in 0.5mg dosages is fine).",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48343778}"

I had no idea how potent this stuff if and have been doing a very slow taper. I can’t find any doctors willing to help me out so I’m stuck on tapering it on my own. I’m getting it from a vendor that isn’t very consistent or reliable when it comes to making solutions. I’m now getting bottles of 4mg/ml as opposed to 5mg/ml Is there a better RC to use for this taper(not sure if this is even an option for me) or should I stick tapering with Clonozolam? Since starting this taper I’ve reduced my dosage from 12mg a day to 10.5- 11mg in 8 days time. Does anyone have any experience with getting off at this high of dose or any suggestions to offer? I have a stash of some Gabapentin and 24 5mg Valium’s for when I reach the end of this. I think I should stock up on a few more bottles of Clonazolam god forbid something happens to my vendor. He had a heart attack recently and I can’t end up in the hospital or rehab as I have a lot riding on me in terms of school and rent. If my parents found out they would pull me out of school.

I used to be a very athletic, healthy, 41Y male (no prior medical history, no addictions) and since a month I'm reduced to a pile of meat without any hope for a happy future. 

Because of a severe outbreak of a lingering burnout I got intense panic attacks and couldn't sleep for days. I was out of my mind. My MD got me on a whopping 4 x 2mg of Xan per day. Totally insane. But you believe the doctor, don't you. And some benzos aren't that dangerous, aren't they (/sarcasme)? But I immediately started reading, got to a psychiatrist and he got me to 6 mg Xan per day (4 x 1,5mg) after only 8 days on 8mg. Right now I'm slowly switching over to Diaz for the interdose withdrawals and that fact that tapering Xan is outright hell (the worst of the worst). I'm somewhere in the vicinity of 5mg Xan as prescribed as follow:

4AM: 1,25mg Xan  
10 AM: 1,25 Xan  
4PM: 0,875 Xan + 5mg Diaz (Val)  
10pm: 0,625 Xan + 10mg Diaz (Diaz more at night for better sleep, although ""better"" is not the right word). 

I didn't react well to a 1 to 10 Xan to Diaz conversion, so we kept something in the middle. Some say it's 1 to 20. In reality nobody has a clue. Official UK guideline says 1/20, but Belgium says 1/10. So what is it? 

In total I'm now a good month on this poison and I know I still have a long way to go. It's pushing me deeper and deeper in a depression. My main focus is getting rid of this poison, but fast ain't the way it seems. It feels like the way ahead is just too long and full of hellish experiences, that I'm losing my mind. I have to keep going on for my 7y old son and my wife, but my life is pure hell. 

I'm aware of the Asthon Manual, but that's more intended for long time use and the tapering takes like almost a year... I can't function anymore and can't financially sustain myself much longer. Perhaps a few months. 

Please respons to these questions:

1) Does someone have tips for me? Is it reasonable to go a tad faster, like 0,25mg Xan every 4-5 days, because I'm not so long on the drug or not?   
2) Any better conversion to Diaz? for the AM dosages? Do mind that 5mg Diaz doesn't really make me sleepy.   
3) How screwed am I?

I am almost 50% down (somewhere around .42mg total per day, or .14mg for each dose). I cut about 4% per month and I've been doing extremely well, all things considered. I ran into a speed bump this summer at about 33% down and was extremely ill for a few weeks, but held for a month or two and resumed my taper.

Anyway, last night I was mixing my dose to take before bed, and usually after I do that I mix up my morning dose and put it in a jar to take when I wake up to go to work. Usually this works out fine. Unfortunately, I was on autopilot for whatever reason and, after taking my night time dose and moving on to prepping the morning dose, I accidentally chugged my morning dose too. I freaked and started crying when I realized what I did. When all was said and done the total I took last night was .28mg instead of of the .14mg I've been sitting at for the last couple days.

I'm terrified that this is either going to screw up my taper or destabilize me and induce symptoms where there really were none. I was kindled last year when my doctor took me off of Klonopin and then put me back on it a couple months later, and it took three times my original dose to stabilize. I've been doing really well after getting on an optimal cut schedule, but I'm very sensitive to changes in my dose and It only took a few doses after I  was placed on klonopin the second time to start going through awful, crippling withdrawals (ended up in ER 3 times). So obviously I'm sweating bullets. 

Does Anyone have experience with this? Will  I be ok? I took my morning dose as scheduled and was hoping that maybe just pretending like it never happened would be the best course of action. Should I have skipped a dose? I'm grasping at anything here. I know the panic is my own right now but god I can't go through this again.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5462874}"

2022-01-24 00:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/sbe0s0/my_mom_needs_help/,My Mom needs Help.,"Hi folks.

My Mom is in 69 years old and in agony with Benzo withdrawals.

For some context - she was put on Clonazapam for 35 years. She started to develop anxiety and agitation after she had her third child (my little brother) and her doctor at the time and all subsequent doctors kept her on the Benzo. She tried to taper off twice  with no success and her doctors and psychiatrists said she needs to be on Benzos for life. She developed depression while taking the Benzo and has also been taking anti depressants for over 20 years.

5 years ago she decided to try to get off them again (third time) and after 3 years of slowly tapering off them (with many withdraws symptoms) she was able to get off it completely however, even though some symptoms went away, she is still dealing with debilitating anxiety and can only manage to get 1 hours of sleep a night.

She went to a new doctor who prescribed her mirtazapine which worked very well for 6 months. This was the first time in in 3 years since going off Benzos she felt great. She had energy (even though it felt artificial) and she slept every night. Sadly the mirtazapine stopped working after 6 months and for the last 1.5 years the symptoms of anxiety and sleepless nights have slowly started to return. The last 4 months have been really hard. We are not sure if she is still going through benzo withdrawals or if she is dealing with the real anxiety she started to develop over 35 years ago. She cant sleep at all! She has been given so many different sleep medications but they don't work. She lays awake all night long.

Her doctor put her on Zoloft early January 2022 and in 2.5 weeks she developed such agitation that we had to take her to the ER and she was put in a psych ward for 6 hours alone while they monitored her and waited for the latest dose of Zoloft to leave her system. The hospital psych wants her to see a regular psychiatrist and wants her and want her to just take mirtazapine only - no more Zoloft.

We don't know what to do. Her golden years are being wasted away. She watches so many YouTube videos and they all say you can heal but it can take several years... I don't know if she she can wait this out till she hits 75. Also, what if she waits another 5 years and still hasn't healed? What if she really has true clinical anxiety that requires benzos or other meds.

I want to help my Mom out. The Benzos helped her raise 3 children, work full time to help raise a family and she accomplished a lot in her life as an immigrant who came to Canada not being able to speak any English. She wants to believe there is hope being off the Benzos but we are not sure what to do?

Would appreciate any thoughts and suggestions?

TLDR: My mom has been on benzos for 35 years. 5 years ago she started to taper off them and took her last dose 2 years ago however, she is still dealing with anxiety.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57501763}"

I was trying to switch from prozac to another antidepressant. Doc was trying to see if something else would help my valium taper faster. It made things worse. So I tapered that and never went back on prozac, since my end goal was to be off all of it anyway.

So here I am 6 months later and am only tapering .5% a month. To compare, I was tapering 1.5% a month while on prozac. The symptoms are just unbearable and I wake up with CRUSHING depression after a cut in valium dose. The nerve pain is also through the rough, I'm thinking prozac was helping mask some of these symptoms and helping me get off valium a little faster. Mind you I'm sitting here typing this with a pinched nerve in my neck shooting down my arm that I've had to miss work for.

Has anyone else found their antidepressant has helped them taper their benzo? I don't want to be on prozac forever but nearly every day for the past 2 months I've debated whether to start taking it again. For the record, my psychiatrist would like me to take it again, so he does know this situation. Just wanted to bounce it off people who have been in a similar situation. Tell me your story and if your antidepressant helped or getting on one made things worse.

I'm starting a new job the day after tomorrow on Monday.  I did 2 separate interviews and I must've done something right although I had massive F-ing headaches I still pulled them off somehow.  

I have so much more energy I actually worked out today.  Eyes no longer hurt and headaches are subsiding.  My heart isn't going crazy and anxiety is low.  All I have are some eye twitches and eye tension if I stare at screens too much.  I've been eating really well and put in about 30 lbs of muscle.  I'm 6 foot and 190 pounds 36 athletic male.  I can feel my body getting stronger.  I can feel the beautiful testosterone flowing again.  I was so happy to workout today.  I was so happy not to have to take a pill to feel good today.  I feel free of the chains that are addiction ... I no longer need a doctor or pharmacy or some pill to dictate my life.  My costs are super low right now.  I have so much more time in the day to do things.

I just detoxed 24 days ago and I figure I'd post an update to you guys.  I jumped off a pretty high dose and I still havnt had any seizures.  I've been sleeping a lot at night and trying to stay busy in the day.

I now have a new car, new job, house is clean, clothes are clean, ate 4 meals today I really cannot complain and I'm hoping that mabye this can be a positive message for anyone reading. 

 I'm a deranged drug addict and it's always all or nothing and if I can give this up anyone can.  Week 1-2 really was awful.  Week 3 started subsiding but headaches were constant.  Eye pain constant.  Now all that is lingering is tinnitus, little eye twitching and a little brain fog but it's lifting fast and I'm feeling like 80% normal.  

I hope you have a great weekend.  Much love to you all!  

Ps -Try not to let all the horror stories scare you because they will make your anxiety so much worse.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.  Now that I'm on the other side I feel almost invincible.  I feel stronger because it didn't kill me.  


Old Post ‐‐------

My old post at Day 12 if you hadn't seen it give some more vital information into this while crazy process.

Well I was down in South America with my father and he died.  Started taking 20 mg clonazepam and 6-10 of alprazolam w/ codeine about a year ago.  Quit the codeine first, then came home to America two months ago.  Of course I knew my dose was unsustainable and brought back 150 clonazepam and tapered that to 2 mg.  Tried to jump and was coping with alcohol and thought it was helping.  I didn't have any seizures but I did end up in tbe hospital once with a super rapid taper and then again a week or two later.  Did a quick 90 lorazepam in a month, tapering then I binged the last week.  Thank God they gave me a week of gabapentin.  So for the jump I was down to anywhere between 2-6 mg lorazepam.  I've come off IV H and dilaudid several times.  It's 3-4 days then you get better.  

I wanted to throw my 2 cents in.  Everyone says switch to a long lasting benzo but I don't think that's great and I'll say why.  If you've ever come off H or methadone you'll know H is short and strong and methadone takes weeks of sickness.  I'd rather be sick hard for a week or two than sick for a month or two.  Lorazepam, I'm on day 12.  I had all the classic symptoms, anxiety, heart palpitations, insane blood pressure, sweating... still sweating a lot, I even had a bit of psychosis / delirium.  At day 12, it's calming down.  I slept 7 hours last night, and I will do it again tonight.  

Trying to stay busy in the day helps, eating good, vitamins, valerian, ashwagandha all had helped.  2 benadryl at night with some super sleep caps herbal and some goodbye stress l-theanine and some neuriva brain supplements and fish oil I am healing.  Now I found that if you read all this, I came off 20 mg clonazepam and up to 10 mg alprazolam for almost a straight year.  If you need hope here is hope fr you.  I HAVNT had a seizure.  I did have Los of psychosis and delirium but you have to keep yourself focused on the end goal.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7199845}"

It started off at .25mg, which did nothing, so we went to .5mg. It helped for a bit, but I’m sure as most of you know I grew to needing more and more, to being at 1.5mg now.

I feel like a zombie. It calms me down for an hour, and then I’m back to being anxious, but now depressed (luckily not suicidal) and so sleepy and depersonalized. I feel like it’s just getting worse and worse anxiety wise and sleepy/ depression wise. I meditate to brain training etc, but something needs to change.

I used Xanax for around 5 years total, starting when I was 18 up until I was 20, I was sober for 3 years before relapsing and beginning use again at 23 until I was 26. I have always had a very high libido and no problems in the sheets, other than maybe not lasting as long as I wanted. I found that around 23, I started experiencing problems getting ready with my girlfriend. It felt like anxiety sometimes, but at other times, I genuinely would want to be intimate and could not be. I chalked it up to my use, as I was an everyday Benzo user when it began to get bad. 

I looked forward to getting sober because I knew I would get all my emotions back, my personality, and most likely my libido and sexual functions. However I am 75 days sober, and it seems to be there and then not. I have trouble when it’s just me by myself, and it’s the same deal when I’m with my GF. I feel like it makes it even worse with the anxiety of worrying “is this going to happen again this time?” thoughts every time before I even start kissing her, which is absolutely a precursor to it happening just as much as the problem is itself. 

I am hoping to have a doctor visit soon. I just feel like I am way too young to be experiencing anything like this, especially being 75 days sober. I feel trapped. I wanted so badly for it to get better when I got sober, AND IT DID, just not to the level I was hoping. Has anyone else experienced anything like this post-use? Could this be the results of neurological damage? I was rapidly taken off of benzodiazepines in the detox I went to, they did not do it correctly and I experienced seizures and almost death, as I was released early from detox and had ended up in the ICU eventually with severe hallucinations and varying heart rates. I am still early in my recovery so I know there is still time for things to improve.

An impulsive urge to use other drugs after taking Xanax. I use to smoke A LOT of weed everyday and a pack to a pack and a half of cigarettes everyday.

Generally just confused and distracted but not particularly focused on anything. I take a pretty low dose I consider but these effects have been vicious on my mental health.

I’ll describe my progression,"On December 4th I checked myself into a treatment facility. The last two years are very blurred in terms of memory. I began with phenibut which reminded me of a benzo. I began taking that a lot and eventually finding research chemicals. 

My first order was etizolam and I never stopped once I got it. I went through etizolam, flualprazolam, and Alprazolam. I quickly became a slave to it, as I had numerous times prior. 

I wanted to stop in this past spring. I started realizing how bad I was becoming but I could not stop no matter what. I had so many pills that I could have tapered myself down for an eternity. I sometimes managed to taper down for a few weeks, almost feeling like I beat it, but would always fall short into a blackout for sometimes days on end. 


REHAB:

Upon checking in rehab for the fourth time, and hoping to be last time, I started with an Ativan taper. This went on until December 13th. So I count my clean date as December 14th. 

Those days were pure hell. My blood pressure was always skyrocketed, my anxiety was so fiercely intense, I never felt it like that. I stayed for another week while they started me on lexapro. I thought leaving would make my anxiety lessen. It did not. I couldn’t leave my house, I was scared to talk to people, I felt this overwhelming adrenaline all day. 

My hands were and still shaking insanely bad. (Not AS bad now, but still bad) I felt this feeling like I could pass out any second, worrying I’d have a seizure daily. But then last week I believe I started to feel better. 

I am actively interviewing for places, exercise daily, and try to not obsess over benzos. Because some times during some days I will. I just try to not let it control me.

My sleep was already struggling for the last few months of my pain med taper and immediately after stopping it.

About 4 weeks ago I stopped taking a second dose and kept myself at 7.5mg at bedtime. My sleep was already suffering prior, but I thought it was due to my wildly changing ambien dosing and taking a second dose for a couple years.

The last month has been hell. I am able to get down now, but will wake up at 1:30-3:30 and unable to fall back asleep most nights.

The irony is so many people around me have gone on holidays, and been out to a million places, yet no Covid for a lot of them. I’ve been hardly anywhere and seen two people, because well I’m 19 months into this hell of a health battle as it is, and naturally, of course I get it. Go figure. I just laugh at this point knowing there’s gotta be some really good shit happening for me sometime in the future, lol.  

**History:**
Not repeating myself too much, go into more details in past posts, but the basics are: 
- June 2020 adverse toxic reaction to flagyl. Life imploded essentially overnight
- SSRI 
- 2.5-5mg Valium intermittently and 1mg Ativan nightly for sleep 9 months-ish
- 3 month taper
- 7 months since jump. 

Months 5 and 6 just tended to be a non-stop wave. I felt perpetually like I had a  hangover and the flu simultaneously. My symptoms are a very big mix of mental and physical. I get jealous sometimes or wonder what’s wrong with me, when I see a lot seeing people post about sweating it out at the gym or going to work, I can’t do either. I spend a large portion of time physically debilitated. 

**My main symptoms still are:** 
- tinnitus 
- sore muscles 
- back and neck pain 
- flu- like feeling 
- adrenaline and cortisol rushes in the morning 
- crushing fatigue 
- nausea 
- head pressure 
- anxiety 
- depression 
- on and off sleep issues 
- brain fog 
- memory issues 
- DRDP on and off 
- horrible cycle symptoms 

In December (month 6), I suffered from either food poisoning or diverticulitis. It’s still sort of unclear. I was bed bound for 10 days or so and it gave me horrible akathisia. I woke up in such severe pain one night that I started screaming and blacking out. We called an ambulance and waited but in the end changed our mind and cancelled it. A few weeks later, I also had neck and back pain that turned into back spasms during the night. I was unable to even lay flat. 

The ongoing feeling of not being in control, and all different health ailments have caused me a lot of panic and anxiety. It’s a combination of feeling out of control, health anxiety, fear, trauma, and amongst that being terrified of doctors giving me medication that will affect me negatively again. It’s hard constantly feeling like you’re on rocky ground, a non stop absence of feeling safe, wondering what is coming next. I just need some time to catch my breath and stand on solid ground again. A little respite from the storm. 

In saying that, there IS progress. It’s become very clear to me what people mean when they say healing is glacial and completely non-linear. It isn’t obvious or sudden and you really have to look for it. At the end of December, right before NYE, in amongst the endless suffering, I had a tiny, brief window. I went to the beach with a friend and it wasn’t until I’d been there for a couple of hours that I realised a busy beach with thousands of people, would have been out of the question, or at the very least totally torturous, a few months ago. Whilst, I still seem to live in a state of hyper vigilance, and it’s easy for me to feel on the verge of a panic attack, each time I have window, even if it is sandwiched between 60 days of a wave, it IS better than the last. 

Prior to getting Covid, and right before this 7 month milestone, I just experienced another window. This time for more like a week. It still isn’t 100%, but once again it feels better than it did. It’s not HUGE, monumental improvements but little things. For instance, my friend came over a few times and actually mentioned she really felt something had changed in the last week. I felt more myself, my personality seemed more like me. I wasn’t having weird moments of existential panic. I even went to the movies, albeit felt on the verge of panic for an hour, it’s something that again would have felt impossible a few months ago. Finally, I hung out at my friends house watching a show. The last time I was there in July, I had to deal with agoraphobia for at least the first hour of being there. I didn’t have that feeling this time. An hour long feeling of panic is more like a few brief feelings of dread now. 

Progress is completely convoluted and at times frustratingly hopeless, but it is there. So many people say they had turning points at months 7,9,10,12,15 and 18. Im really holding onto that and hope that is the same for me. I still have so much life left to life, good moments to feel, and things to achieve.",11,{'covid': 3},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6416369}"

I did not touch the stuff until late 2021 when I was going through a rough patch in my life. I then took them for only about 2 weeks and only about 6 mgs a day and stopped again and had another seizure. Then fast forward to last week when I had another moment of weakness and took them for 6 days at around 4 mgs a day. Stopped cold turkey again and you guessed it, I had another seizure. I am currently typing this from the bed of the emergency room. For anyone out there who is thinking about taking xanax, even if prescribed I would say not to. The process and whole atmosphere around taking the drug is not worth it. I have hurt people around me and myself.

Also, i have been on 1mg Clonazepam for 5-6 months and did n direct switch to 20mg diazepam which was smooth but now after wanting to have Christmas and other stressful situations come up i been on diazepam 20mg for a month now. Have Stressful stuff coming up too and also made me not drop yet.

The problem is the last 2 days been tough and today is very rough and have not even tapered yet. Problem is i think tolerance has got me and with the phenibut it makes it worse.

Today i just felt very bad feeling in my head. Felt stiff, anxious and felt like panic(felt like i was going to not make it and something bad was going to happen.) The phenibut helps but it didn't tonight and i am terrified it's going to get worse.

The problem is now I'm not sure how to taper further from this point to no longer have dependence. Dosing the flual lower is a challenge because I only have presses and I can't get them much smaller. I'm worried that switching to something shorter acting like etizolam would give me lots of rebound in the day. I have access to .5 alprazolam slow releases and I was thinking of switching to those for a week or two and eventually diazepam to finish the taper. Any advice?

I ended up getting bars off a deepweb market that upon later lab testing were shown to contain an unknown amount of Clonazolam.

I didn't know it was Clonazolam until I found a psychiatrist who would prescribe me a benzo, thinking I had been taking 8mg of Xanax (or 4 of these bars a day despite attempts to control my use) for about a month and a half. Previous to that, I usually went in streaks of 4-6 days of using Klonopin or Xanax (whichever was prescribed for any given period of time) for four years before taking breaks anywhere between 3-14 days.

Initially she prescribed me 4mg of Klonopin per day and after months of insisting that dose wasn't helpful (I had tried it and found absolutely 0 relief from WD) before trying different RC benzos and not taking the prescription at all. 
I decided to just go back to Clonazolam, which was advertised as such at 1.1mg from a different vendor. 
Psychiatrist switched me from Kpin to Xanax at the same dose, 4mg per day at our appointment 2 weeks ago. 
I am aiming to taper my clonazolam until I can take the prescription she gives me and go down to 0mg from there. I am still taking none of the prescription at the moment.

After 2 weeks of 5.5mg clonazolam spread out through the day, I tried to make a reduction of .25mg and had severe insomnia. After about 4-5 days of that (and having college to worry about), I went back to 5.5mg/day.

I am thinking now staying on this dose for 4 weeks before trying to make the same reduction could be helpful. It has been about 6 days presently on this dose again.

Has anyone else successfully done this? I wanted to make a solution to make the taper smoother, but was informed by a friend I would need pure clonazolam powder for that after already ordering another 200 clonazolam bars.

So in the interest of not wasting money and making this process as smooth as possible, I'm not sure if tapering at a slower rate reducing by quarters of the pills would be helpful, as opposed to selling the incoming order to one of the people I know who would buy clonazolam, in interest of obtaining powder or a solution.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52741706}"

Before joining the detox, I had tapered already. I was taking 1.5mg a day from 2nd to 10th December and then 1mg a day from 10th to 18th December. At which point I could not resist the temptation to quit and joined the detox program. I was already down to 1mg a day klonopin. 

Anyhow today is my doctors appointment in 2 hours and I am wondering if I ought to restart and continue my taper where I left it off.

Problem is, Even though I’m okay rn, functional in the basic sense, I still have bad DPDR ,bouts of anxiety that come and go, I can’t drink a beer without severe debilitating rebound anxiety, still can’t relax or enjoy, and there’s something about bright lights and uncomfortable situations that triggers everything.
These are problems are just what remains. These are my protracted withdrawal symptoms. Even though I am functional, I feel like I have no footing. 

Needless to say the first 14-17 days of my withdrawal were pure hell. I was in a very very nice detox facility, the premium kind and yet 2 days in, it made no fucking difference how nice the facility was. It was full dpdr anxiety restless energy nervousness all the freaking time. It’s made very very wary of abusing benzos again.

In my mind I’m thinking if I restart my taper and continue on it, after talking to my doc ofcourse, my protracted withdrawal symptoms will end forever. One month of benzos on a taper and I might never have to worry about my protracted withdrawal symptoms ever again. On the other hand, if I don’t restart and continue my taper, these protracted withdrawal symptoms might last for 2-3 more months, or maybe even upto an year.

Edit

Thanks for all the answers guys. I honestly don't trust a single fucking doctor when it comes to benzos. I was handed a script of 60 2mg and it's my fault I got addicted when life went to shit? Yeah, no. The flu alprazolam is the one that lasts the longest where I can take the least amount and feel it, or at least feel normal. I'll literally shave off microdoses until a normal amount of Xanax works again, then I'll tell my doctor to taper me off that with diazepam. Only thing that makes sense to me.

MY CNS exploded. I now found out that drinking a bit of alcohol makes me feel substantially better. Now I suspect that parts of my long COVID are actually withdrawal symptoms. What should I do now? Is it worth to test this hypothesis by updosing my Xanax for a short amount of time?

&#x200B;

Hi all,

I have been using (prescribed) Xanax for the last 13 years. Most of that time at a fairly low dose of 1x .5mg a day. It worked very well for most of the time, but now I found out about negative sides about benzos, I suspect that I have been experiencing tolerance for quite a while already and so much stuff that happened makes sense now (the overly sensitive nervous system... OMG!!). 

Anyways, I got COVID in April 2020, and it was really mild - no big deal. But afterwards hell broke loose. Mainly neuro stuff such as Dysautinomia/POTS, exertion intolerance, overstimulation, sleep disturbance, etc. I was housebound for more than a year and couldn't even take a zoom call without completely being wiped out from overstimulation. My brain would feel like it implodes, I would sweat, shake and my speech would slur and I would just kind of collapse. Just from a simple zoom call. It felt like I had become allergic to adrenaline. A simple phone call with my doctor would drench me in sweat and I my speech would slur from these adrenaline rushes. It was horrendous, the worst time of my life.

I know that these can be consequences of COVID, and I considered myself to have long covid, but I also tapered down my Xanax quite quickly around that time. Don't ask me why. Somehow I thought that it would be good to dose it down to get well. I also am an expat in the UK and get my prescription from mainland Europe, which wasn't possible during lockdown. I don't know, it's all blurry now. 

I got from 0.5mg to 0.125 in a fairly short amount of time (a month perhaps). I went from 0.5mg to 0.375, to 0.25 to 0.125. I knew noting about benzos at the time, only that you shouldn't CT. In hindsight, I suspect that I gave my nervous system a double whammy of covid and severe withdrawal. I thought I had these severe symptoms because of COVID, but I now feel that the withdrawal might be to blame. 

I'm still not fully recovered (far from), but better than I was. I can work from home, but still am not well. However, I made a very interesting observation lately. Many of my neurological symptoms get better when I drink a bit of alcohol. A glass of wine is enough to make me feel considerably better (but I get a hangover for 2-5 days in return). I haven't had a drop of alcohol for most of the last two years, so this came as a surprise. But it made me think that if alcohol makes my symptoms to get so much better, I might just be in withdrawal. I have been holding my dose of 0.125mg for more than a year now. 

With these new insights, I'm now considering to temporarily updose again to see whether I experience relief and get to a level at which I'm functional to then taper down much more slowly? Would that make sense? I'm afraid that I damaged my nervous system severely and indefinitely by this and don't know what the wisest step forward is now.

I have taken about 10 - 15mg for about 1.5 months, in the early stages I was being more careful and only did it every other day or would do 2-3 days and then take off 3. I am feeling what I believe to be benzo withdrawals. Intense anxiety, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, terror, diarrhea, etc.


I haven't found any articles on how long it'll take me to go through all the withdrawals being that I have only been doing them for about 1.5 months. Will it take a shorter amount of time and I should just stop them altogether now? Or should I taper. 


Currently I am doing about 5mg of valium per day and trying to not use any on Fridays or the weekend if I can bear it. I have severe back pain as well and the muscle tightness caused by the severe anxiety and other symptoms are very difficult. I would go just cold turkey but I have a career/house that I have to keep going.


Any advice on how to best quit or other medications I could use to help (I also have some Xanax fyi). Or how to navigate keeping my life, house and career throughout all of this would be greatly appreciated. I am so scared right now...


EDIT: Thank you everyone and sorry for the lack or response. I went the weekend without any and it was rough but i'm not down to only 5 mg of Valium per day on the weekdays and none on the weekends. Going to wait another week and cut to .25, do that for 2 weeks and then CT. Based on your advise and a few other study's, I'm going to just stick with valium.

EDIT: It's been 5 days since I last had a valium and I have not had any withdrawal symptoms! I am so lucky... and happy right now. I guess my light-ish use over 1.5 months wasn't enough to make my physically dependent. I must have just been going through bad anxiety, which I've never had that bad during that time. I was 100% certain that I was dependent tho... I stopped using 3 times and after 1-3 days, terrible anxiety would kick in and not stop. I once made it 3 days into those withdrawals and then took 1 mg of Xanax. Another time I made it through 1 day of withdrawals and then took 0.5mg of Valium. Then I used for about 3 days, using 0.5 to .075 mg of Valium and then none since last Sunday evening. I cannot believe it. I have back issues and cannot handle benzo withdrawals. I have learned my lesson and will never be using benzos more than a couple times a month, if that! I can't believe these things are prescribed for daily use. Thanks everyone who helped me during a very brutal time. I'm sure that some of it was a slight brain chemical imbalance but it seems to have gone away for the most part.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44676355}"

My main issue is whether to reinstate (I have plenty to do this). I am ***13 days*** from last dose (a rapid taper I will describe below), though withdrawal is unbearable right now.

* I was prescribed 10mg diazepam in September 2020. I did not take very often, and when I did was usually 5mg, sometimes 2.5.
* In October 2021 I became stressed with work and started taking 5mg probably every other night, occasionally 10mg.
   * Late November 2021 I decided to give up drinking, and figured I'd keep taking the diazepam to ward off any withdrawals (which I think were unlikely).
   * So we're looking at **3ish months** of consistent use.
* On December 12 I started my diazepam taper - I had read the Ashton method but didn't think I was using enough to justify such a prolonged deal.
   * So I dropped to 5mg for a week, then 2.5 for a week, then crumbs over the holidays.
* Symptoms - began December 23ish, reached what I would call an apex on Jan 3.
   * While I was in the ""crumb"" phase I started to have very bad panic attacks; like a wave in my abdomen through my heart, racing thoughts, etc. I should have recognized this was withdrawal, but I was not sure.
   * My last dose was on December 28.
   * I was relatively fine until January 1.
   * By January 3, I realized something was very wrong.
      * Extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, auditory distortion, dizziness, tinnitus, intrusive thoughts that I just cannot shake, fear, etc.
   * I had a few days of relative relief January 4 and 5, then it all came back January 6.
   * For me the issues are almost completely psychological. I feel so terrible.
* What I'm doing now and for myself.
   * I'm running a few miles a day, taking supplements (GABA, passionflower, chamomile, magnesium, theanine, bedtime tea), eating extremely well, breathing exercises, seeing a therapist once a month, starting a mediation/yoga class today.
   * My wife is very understanding and has been beyond supportive. I am grateful for her.
* **My questions/concerns**
   * Are all these symptoms normal? The instrusive thoughts are the worst, I don't know how to shake them, this is nightmare fuel. They are extremely uncomfortable. How long will this last?
   * What is the likelihood that my rapid taper caused damage? Will reinstatement remedy that? This is probably my biggest concern.
   * Am I took late to go back? *Should* I go back?
   * I know this is a very individualized experience with no set rubric, but I am seeing stories of months to years of withdrawal. My job will not allow me to experience that, so if I have to do an Ashton method taper, I will. And even then, will Ashton minimize my withdrawal?
   * I have brain fog, but am able to accomplish tasks - like I wrote an article today for work, it just took longer than normal.
   * Will I ever be normal?
* **Other**:
   * I have no any urges to use (anything) - I am fucking done. This was never a ""high"" for me.
   * There is little in the way of physical symptoms aside from some muscle twitching, etc.
   * Some days are good, some are horrific.
      * For example, I felt almost normal for two days; then this morning I had the intrusive thoughts and racing heart, and a little on the way home from work.
   * Kindling is a possibility - I used inconsistently over the past year, some weeks on, some weeks off - never noticed severe symptoms, but I was also drinking (not heavily) at the time.

I am in day 7 of sertraline and 3 days in taking half of Bromazepan.
Rn mí simptoms are feeling lightheaded w/mental fog  , anxiety , chest pain, heart palpitations and feeling unwell.
The mornings are hell, the chest pain last all day ,and recently at night I have  trouble sleeping (wake up in middle of night with palpitations).
So I don't know what to do how to taper, should I switch to Diazepam?
Should I stop taking sertraline or go through it?(I know it can make things worse for some time but maybe it can help later??)
I will go to my psych next week but some advice would be helpful!.

About 15 years ago I was on a milligram of Klonopin for sleep for 3 years and then a doctor at the sleep clinic Cold turkeyed me. What followed was about 6 months of hell. 

This past February I was fast tracked off Zoloft that I'd been on for 13 years.. In August I had the first panic attack in a series. That began 5 months of horrible anxiety,tinnitus  through the roof, reinstatement of sertraline 50mg then raised to 100mg, 50 lb of weight loss and reintroduction of Klonopin 1 mg , with a quarter four times a day. I thought when I got feeling better that I could fast taper off since it was only 21 or so days.... horrible rebound anxiety, insomnia all the original symptoms of the SSRI  crash. I begged to be reinstated as I was afraid I would find a way to end my life to stop the pain. The GP did but I had to wait a month to see the psychiatrist so now I'm on to three months and change time on.

The  Psych started a taper that seemed reasonable to me, I dropped from the .75mg of Klonopin with .25 three times a day to .25 two times a day with drops every 14 days. I didn't have any issues till the final .25. I had a week to go and asked the Dr if I could drop it to 1/8th for the last few days and he agreed. So I did. I stopped sleeping well that week but I unfortunately didn't pay attention. two days post jump on the 28th of November I went into acute withdrawal. 

 Dry heaves, no appetite, panic and anxiety through the roof, body pain, tinnitus, total insomnia, I got so dehydrated .I actually was really ready to just give up and go back on but my psych made a comment that opened the door to a new chance. He said we may have to consider detox. I'm thinking are you serious?? I'm coming off three months of Klonopin use?!? How could I possibly need medical detox? I called a hospital mental health and Addiction recovery center and got an immediate appt with one of their psychs. Long story really long. when I was desperate to go back on to stop the pain, she wouldn't let me. 

 My sister came, they fed me, walked with me, made sure I was hydrated and on Christmas day I had the first window of my recovery. I'm now starting week seven post jump and it's been bearable and the addiction psych says I'm now in post acute and I can sure tell the difference. I'm not a danger to myself anymore. 

Today I guess I'm in a wave and its been building. I pray today was the peak but who knows. waves of cold and panic, heightened anxiety with no thoughts provoking it, more sensitivity to changes in tinnitus but the anxiety and depersonalization have been the hardest. I could use a boost y'all. Any words of encouragement so I can keep going would be massively appreciated. I love this sub and y'all are the best most supportive people I've ever met. 

On a good note, for those coming after me, the difference between acute and post acute is night and day. As one poster said, it's hard but the symptoms don't run the show most days.

For the past two months I've had alot of stress-related things happen to me.. I started a new job as cashier for walmart and a new puppy ect. So I few days I would have bad days and take an extra dose, and that would leave me short before I could get more.

2. Hot and cold flashes
3. Low appetite 
4. Weird head feeling
5. Body aches
6. Irritated

Lexapro 10mg a day
Mirtazapine 15mg at night
Gabapentin 1000 mgs is day
Propranolol  20 mg 3 times a day(just took my first one to see if it helps, and it did. I've had them for 3 months without taking them. Made more tired, but stopped the racing heart. 
Kratom up to 12 grams a day. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

I see her tomorrow, she will probably write another script, but won't be able to fill till th 13th or 14th. I'm screwed.  (IM GOING TO ASK TO SWITCH TO DIAZAPAM FOR THE REST OF MY TAPER)

I just need help with tips and tricks to feel better, if there are any. My girlfriend is no help, she actually started a fight with me before she left for work. She does this all the time. I take care of her really well, but she is borderline personality disorder, so she's no help.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this because I want to know if there are some strength athletes (powerlifting, weightlifting, bodybuilding, cross-fit, etc) going through a benzo withdrawal or considering making one. 

I'm a 32 yo powerlifter with a long history of sports. I basically have done calisthenics and martial arts since I was 21, then changed to powerlifting 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

I've been an addict to klonopin for 9 years and it has been a hell of a way.

Started taking it cause i couldn't sleep, so my mother brought me to the neurologist and this is where it began. 

&#x200B;

I'm a nutritionist by profession so my recovery has been okay cause i take care of my diet, at least to keep my macros and mostly protein intake as it should be, but, i've always had recovery problems and i can't wait to come back what it used to be my recovery without benzos. 

&#x200B;

I have also gained weight through the years and my body composition got worse because I also take an antidepressant (tricycle type) to put me to sleep,  but mostly, i dont have the TMR I used to have before when I was training several times per day and lived to talk about it.

&#x200B;

I could take 2-3 martial arts training sessions per day. Today I can barely stand 4 training sessions a week. 

&#x200B;

I started my withdrawal around 4 months ago… reached the phase where i have replaced klonopin for valium and at the moment i'm taking 30mg before going to bed, now it's going to get worse i guess.

&#x200B;

For everyone, I know  this is extraordinarily complicated and sleep is trash, but I wanted to give a moment to those who do a competitive sport or basically wanna excel on their performance. 

&#x200B;

I want to know how it has been, how it is going with the WD and how it is going after it (in case some of you athletes are clean already)

&#x200B;

I also want to say: please don't quit your sport, it has helped me tremendously to keep my mental sanity and even when i'm stuck and  going through a phase where i'm basically no longer becoming stronger, but even also going backwards in terms of progress, i guess is normal to question yourself if its worth it to push it as hard as you were used to.

I estimate my nervous system to be 65%-70% healed, I think? I haven’t had a full-blown panic attack in maybe 6 months. I mean the total meltdown kind, where you are completely terrified, and feel like you have always been this way / you will always be this way.

But one day this week I had a cup of coffee before some workmen came to my house briefly, and my reaction to it was profound. (My usual caffeine intake is zero, for obvious reasons). I got completely flustered when I thought there might be an issue with our service, and suddenly I couldn’t answer simple questions or think straight. 

I was mostly embarrassed by my reaction while they were still there, and only after they’d left did it occur to me that the caffeine had hijacked my nervous system and affected me way more than it should have.

The rest of the day my heart was pounding way harder than usual, my hands shook, and a weird benzo-related tic I thought was gone returned. I tried to go to bed at my usual hour, but couldn’t sleep until about 1 AM.

I don’t mean to imply that a cup of coffee set my recovery back, but it did illustrate very plainly to me that my brain is still injured from these cursed pills, and give me a reality check as to how far I have to go.

First and second year dosages between 1mg to 3mg max
Third year 3- 4 mg (some crises with 8mg)
Last year 6-8mg (crises reaching 24mg in one day a couple of times - also mixed 2mg with alcohol a few times and once mixed 18mg with alcohol and valium trying to die)

Now I'm 3mg a day for 2 weeks.
My family last year saw the dip shit I was in now they want me taper asap. Like why can't you drop to 2mg now, start with natural medicine and then stop until the end of the month? 

I've been trying to taper, and yes I'm a mess that's failing. My doctor doesn't give a shit (but its free) about explaining tapering; he just gave me valium and imovane to trade the xanax.

I'm angry (and maybe that's withdrawal already) and lost and I will end up doing more stupid shit if I'm pressured because that's what I do.

The only medication I had at the time was Ativan for take as needed and I didn’t know it was a substance not to mess with. I soon got diagnosed with ocd so the thought of getting off of Ativan (and constantly worrying about withdrawals) made the process so scary. I used 2mg, 2 a day so 4mg total for about 3 months straight. I made the mistake of reading other people’s experiences and anticipating the same

I was so scared to taper but I knew it was the right choice (I also was taking Prozac and built that up in my system for a couple of weeks). At first, I had some bad migraines but I think they were due to my lack of eating and exercising. I had a reoccurring dream that I spiraled and needed 4mg of Ativan and had no self control - but that never happened! Once I got used to the taper (0.5 less every two weeks) I had no issues and my confidence grew. To ease my mind, my therapist also said our bodies may not notice 0.5mg missing. And now I’ve been free of Ativan for almost a month and my anxiety is down a lot!

I became aware of  this fact that I self sabotage the other day,  that there are  something's I  possibly have been doing or do not do that may help me, I  allow fear to keep me stuck too often, I get trapped in  a negative  mind set and become a long term prisoner of my own mind, as well as the  withdrawal itself also causing this symptom we can unwittingly make it  worse for ourselves too   


Which then keeps me a prisoner of the  Diazepam for even longer and I think 20+ year's and counting is long  enough.   So I've been taking a good look at myself, taking stock,  and  am now trying to find tools to help me outside of what I've already  tried as the more coping tools you have to hand the better, and  also  doing the questionnaires on these links besides being helpful to give  you a different out look is also a good distraction which will be  useful  to you as well

I graduate this semester and while I successfully was tapering I got a 4.0 but I had no life. Put everything into my mental health, school, and had no time for anything else. Now I have to resume that these next three and a half months until I graduate. Today I make a big cut. 25 to 20 mg of diazepam. I’m not gonna lie, it hasn’t all been bad. Certainly not as horrendous as some people’s posts I’ve seen. But to say im not depressed/struggling would be a lie. Everyday I pray for better days. These next two weeks will be hard on my body and mind as I get accustomed to 20 mg, half my dose of Valium I started on which I was on for 10 months. I have been tapering since august. I think a lot of emotions I’ve been suppressing have emerged. Which feels amazing but not so amazing when you want to cry 24/7. It comes in waves. Nighttime is the hardest. I can deal with anxiety and depression but it can get exhausting. I got clean from Kratom over 6 months ago after a 4 year daily habit. Quit it cold turkey. Some of what I feel may be PAWS, but majority of it is probably Benzo related. The Kratom CT was hell. I overcame it, probably still dealing with residual symptoms. But the Benzo taper on top of that and being back in my apartment sucks. And I have random body pain it doesn’t really bother me I take Advil daily and the pain gets bad at night. My worst symptom which I just got a few days ago out of nowhere is exploding head syndrome. I think it might be the Trazodone im on to sleep. I’m being pumped with ssris and trazodone and adhd meds and I’m tired of all medication. I’m just so tired. Because I have adhd and short term memory issues now I have to remind myself to even take my diazepam or meds. I’m praying for better days but I know this drop will be one of the worst, because now I found a new psych who won’t be dropping me so quickly at intervals of 5 mg every 3 weeks like my old psych who fired me because I told her she’s going too fast. I feel like no one believes my depression. Anyways I’m writing this cause I have no one to talk to. While Kratom CT was hard, this almost feels harder because Kratom I knew I would feel better eventually (I know some people here will laugh at Kratom withdrawal but it was hard ok?) but this feels dragged out depression. (FYI I experience mainly depression from this taper where they just give me an ssri which doesn’t work and I’m tired of it). I don’t know if this is PMS from my period but I feel fragile. I just want a hug and someone to tell me that getting off of Kratom and tapering off benzos I’ll be ok. And there are times that I do but there’s always a dark cloud lingering. Anyway I’m gonna go take a shower, and cry myself to sleep while I hear weird hallucinations in my ear that wake me up. Thinking of getting my vitamins checked because in august I had an extreme vitamin D defiency which I took supplements for as my dr suggested for 12 weeks but since Ive stopped supplementation of vitamin D and I started my adhd meds (which burns through vitamin levels like hell) I should get blood work done. Regardless I refuse to be a victim of any drug withdrawal but I just hope I feel ok again. FYI I usually feel fine but tonight for some reason I’m struggling. Probably stress of knowing I’m making another cut and school starting and being back in this apartment. I’m supposed to be happy. This is supposed to be great. I’m graduating in a few months. But I’m not ok. I don’t feel well! My parents don’t get it. I’m only 22. I should’ve known Kratom wasn’t just a plant and I should’ve known how hard benzos can be on the brain and body cause I’ve quit benzos before but had no symptoms but now I’m on a higher dose and now I have symptoms. But it’s nice to cry again and not be in this benzo coma! Sorry for my long post and unorganized. Adhd med wore off and I’m exhausted.

It started as a sleep aid, since my home life is stressful to the point where I wasn't able to sleep, and benzos would knock me out. I've been trying to taper down numerous times with a doc's help, but I always eventually end up sabotaging myself. Like, run out of your 1 mg of clonopin before your doctor can prescribe you more? Get some xanax and take 1.5 mg instead. Do a closing shift and your boss wants you in for an opening shift, knowing full well you'll only have about 4 hours of sleep? Take a .5 of clonopin and an additional 1mg of xanax. Seroquel not working, been up for an hour despite taking a your meds? Panic and take more xanax.

It's a cycle like this, over and over and over again. I want to be done with it. I want to get rid of this evil drug out of my life completely. But every time I try to taper, I buckle and get more. I know the constant is my home life, every psych and therapist I work with knows that it will be better once I leave. I live with other addicts, and that's how I get the unprescribed xanax. But I don't have enough to move out. I won't have enough until late 2022, is my best guest. But I can't keep staying dependent. I hate it. I hate it more than anything.

Started taking 20 mg clonazepam and 6-10 of alprazolam w/ codeine about a year ago.  Quit the codeine first, then came home to America two months ago.  Of course I knew my dose was unsustainable and brought back 150 clonazepam and tapered that to 2 mg.  Tried to jump and was coping with alcohol and thought it was helping.  I didn't have any seizures but I did end up in tbe hospital once with a super rapid taper and then again a week or two later.  Did a quick 90 lorazepam in a month, tapering then I binged the last week.  Thank God they gave me a week of gabapentin.  So for the jump I was down to anywhere between 2-6 mg lorazepam.  I've come off IV H and dilaudid several times.  It's 3-4 days then you get better.  

I wanted to throw my 2 cents in.  Everyone says switch to a long lasting benzo but I don't think that's great and I'll say why.  If you've ever come off H or methadone you'll know H is short and strong and methadone takes weeks of sickness.  I'd rather be sick hard for a week or two than sick for a month or two.  Lorazepam, I'm on day 12.  I had all the classic symptoms, anxiety, heart palpitations, insane blood pressure, sweating... still sweating a lot, I even had a bit of psychosis / delirium.  At day 12, it's calming down.  I slept 7 hours last night, and I will do it again tonight.  

Trying to stay busy in the day helps, eating good, vitamins, valerian, ashwagandha all had helped.  2 benadryl at night with some super sleep caps herbal and some goodbye stress l-theanine and some neuriva brain supplements and fish oil I am healing.

I'm 3 years off a clonazepam cold turkey which induced severe mental akathisia to levels I have never seen talked about on forums or benzo buddies or Reddit. I have had 24/7 RACING thoughts, looping thoughts jumping from topic to topic, obsessions and compulsions, intrusive memories, intrusive thoughts, phobias, my brain thinks everything is a threat. I was lucky that I didn't experience the physical as much.

However, in month 8 off benzos I was so suicidal I was baker acted and put on Remeron and Seroquel. I only took Seroquel for 2 weeks but stayed on Remeron. I have been on Remeron ever since and managed to taper from 15mg to 5.5mg over a year or so. I had enough thinking stopping Remeron at 5.5mg would stop all the racing and looping insanity I deal with 24/7. The first day I felt a little calmer, the next day I had insomnia for the first time and today I got hit with SEVERE pacing akathisia and internal akathisia. SO right now I have all three forms at level 10/10.

I have become obsessed with finding how to stop this since it started in Nov 2018. Everything I read is contradictory. One person says magnesium set them back to hell and the next person said it healed them. I know everyone has different. I have terrified myself from taking anything and all that goes through my head 24/7 are things I have read, people's experiences, horror stories, etc, and all the racing and looping intrusive thinking.

I am terrified of reinstating even though it's only been 3 days without taking it. I am just freaking out for no reason, right? I plan on taking it tonight. My next plan is to get with someone that knows individual biochemistry based on my functional tests and bloodwork and start trying supplements, herbs, etc, and possibly drugs. I don't want to live like this anymore. I do everything right regarding diet, grounding, etc but I have been totally screwed.

When I say I am one of the worst cases I am basing it on the length of time off the original drug and the fact I have mental and physical together at extremely high levels. I know this is not common.

It helped me sleep immensely, I wake up refreshed and ready for the day, but nowadays while I feel generally rested, pain free, and calmer, I feel a little de-motivated. My strict regiment of exercising 3x a week has become a random workout every once in a while and I don’t have the same intensity.

I have the impression my doctor will continue to perscribe Xanax after my mouth guard comes in next month to manage my work stress induced clenching, I’m just a little concerned about dependency.  I tried to sleep without it one or two days and couldn’t sleep. I’m not the best sleeper but I was basically tossing the whole night.

I’m not taking Xanax during the day. So I’m not familiar with the “high” associated with abuse. I take it right before I go to bed and I’m asleep in 20 minutes. But I am concerned I won’t be able to sleep without it.

I’m going to try to taper back down to .5mg and maybe use it only when I have stressful day, as that’s when I clench the most.

I don’t want to go into too much detail about my backstory but I really struggled with abusing klonopin and Xanax when I was in my early 20’s. About 5.5 years ago I hit my lowest point and finally stopped. It was such a struggle but I made it out and built a good, stable life for myself. 

Unfortunately, the pandemic has made things very tough for my mental health and I had a breakdown at my doctor’s office yesterday. This was a new doctor who didn’t know my history, and she mentioned maybe trying a benzo to alleviate some of my symptoms. Since quitting, I’ve been tempted here and there by people using recreationally, but never was offered a prescription again. I felt like time stopped in that moment, I just wanted to throw away everything I’ve worked for and numb myself from it all. Even after 5.5 years, my first instinct was to say yes and take whatever she would give me and go down the rabbit hole again. 

But by some miracle, I found myself saying no and telling her I had a history of benzo abuse and did not want them ever to be part of my treatment plan. I know it’s not that big of a deal… but I was truly tempted in that moment for the first time in a while, and I’m proud of myself for saying no and sticking to being benzo free.",75,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46027812}"

Not looking to create a big thing here:

A.) Only requirement for being present is increasing contemplation of  the stopping the use of Benzodiazepines. 

B.) 45-60 minute, structured Zoom call, Facilitated by professional Therapist (Me). The call may include a Topic Discussion, Testimony, or ‘Free Talk’. It’s simply a chance to talk about your shit. 

C.) Verbal Participation is NOT required; join the zoom, turn off your video/mic and simply listen to others if that’s what you care to do. 

**Other ideas for the group are welcome; please feel free to DM or add to the comments.**

Im fairly confident this could be a great way for some of the people who are on r/benzorecovery to voice their issues more specifically, with a better sense of community feedback. I for one, could Also use some pals in my life who Actually get the reality of this predicament!

Little did I know the depths benzos had changed mind and body.

So I (25F)  used to have another user and I posted the first couple months after getting clean and you all supported me, so I'm writting this because maybe someone needs to read this. I've been clean for 5 months now, no tapering from the high dose I used to take, while having undiagnosed and untreated severe depression and dealing with a long term relationship break up. I started therapy but couldn't take benzos because of my addiction so I have to go through it raw. 

It's not easy. It sucks, a lot. You need to learn to deal with anxiety and feeling depressed again all by yourself and it will take some time. Months, even, I'm still learning myself. I've relapsed a couple of times, but that's part of the process I guess. Sometimes I'm wondering why I'm clean, it was so much easier being high and just feeling happy, ignoring all my problems and feeling like a normal person. The thing is addiction stole so much from me, and didn't see it until I got clean. 

I became manipulative towards my ex to get my dose. I would lie, act like a fucking child to get my pills. Absolutely pathetic, and he got fed up with me and left me. My problems piled up while I got high and became bigger and bigger.  I tried to get clean twice before finally getting clean for good. You will have sleepless nights maybe panic attacks, dissociation and other unpleasant stuff that will last for maybe one month or two, but it's worth it. It's better than not having control over your own emotions, avoiding what makes you feel the need to take drugs and don't processing bad feelings. It always blows up. Benzodiacepines helped me repress the bad things going on in my life, including my mental illness. I was on the verge of doing something radical and I couldn't even see it because I was so out of touch with reality. You can't be functional while being addicted. You're  supposed to feel things and process it, because it's the only way to change what is hurting you. Being addicted to benzos harmed my liver and the unprocessed feelings harmed other of my organs. I'm healthy now!

If you're looking reasons for not getting clean, or relapsing. It's never worth it. Never. You won't see how much harm this things has done to you until you're clean. If you know how to tape, sure, go for it, especially if you're taking a dangerously high dose, maybe get medical help if you can. But it sucks, tapering or, not because withdrawals but because all the things you've been repressing while using. 

I'm not special, I'm not stronger than any of you guys. Don't focus on the physical symptoms you will experience, think about it like a flu. You're sick, but it doesn't last forever. Things get so much better, and after this experience you will stronger and wiser. Bad feelings get less bad.

I took one on Dec 30th, then on Dec 31st I missed a dose and had a few beers, I woke up feeling really crazy panicking and sweating I couldn't sit still we had to drive back for 6 hours from where we were and went straight to the hospital like I was losing my mind.

What Does Norepinephrine Do? Together with adrenaline, norepinephrine increases heart rate and blood pumping from the heart. It also increases blood pressure and helps break down fat and increase blood sugar levels to provide more energy to the body.

Anyone else experience this? After only 3 days I believe I have no choice but to pull the plug on this. Does it mellow, get worse? Quit now and not have to taper late (it’s an ER too, making tapering difficult)",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9537449}"

2022-01-04 18:35:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/rw82st/cold_sensations_most_of_the_time/,cold sensations most of the time,"Hi! I just wanted to know if anybody else has experienced this. It's a cold sensation which could be called cold oversensitivity, like I feel freezing as soon as cold air touches my face or arms, but then, if this gets out of control, it starts to feel like something added to the cold. Not pain, but intensely annoying and disctracting. 

The thing is, i've played around with clonazepam dosage (like an idiot, not following my psych's instructions) for about a year and a half now. This ""side effect"", if it is indeed caused by the klonopin, started only 3 months ago, when I was tapering off it (probably way faster than I should have). I tried suspending it completely, for around 4 days, and decided that it wasn't the cause of this sensation, but I've read experiences which do mention temperature issues (by the way, my skin actually gets hotter when I feel cold, but it doesn't affect core temp, as shown by an armpit thermometer).

I was taking .5mg divided in 2 doses each day but returned to 1mg because it, sometimes, helps with the cold. I've been to a neurologist and an endocrinologist and they have no idea what the cause of the coldness is, so now I'm wondering if tapering and getting off of klonopin would likely get rid of this weird ""symptom"".

Another problem is that I can't explain to doctors how bothersome and distracting it is, so they just tell me not to worry about it and wear more clothing. I'd have to cover my whole face and neck because even if I feel it only in a small protion of my skin, it feels horrible and doesn't let me do pretty much anything for hours at a time.

I've also noticed that it sometimes goes away after I eat a lot. Some days are good and others are hell (no disrespect to people who've suffered way worse symptoms).

So anyway... could such a low dose, or perhaps the constant fluctiation of the dose cause this? I know that sometimes one can experience withdrawal even when taking the same dose for weeks or months, so maybe it is a side effect?

I think these drugs did damage my nervous system and doesn't allow me among many things to handle properly the stress that the body and mind suffer, but well I'm not a doctor... just gonna write few things.

Almost everything cause fear to me, but there are two things that currently are on my mind since lately has been happening more and I would like to have some answers and guidance if possible...

When I do take a shower, it's extremelly stressful to me and when that's over, the problem comes when I'm about to sleep. If that same day I did take a shower and it wasn't early in the morning I would be fully awake like if I did drink 10 coffees or so, I'm not nervous but I'm uncapable to sleep until many hours after the shower (I know the best is to shower in the morning in this case but I ""can't"" do it always...), ruining my sleep schedule. I do struggle to shower a lot and this doesn't help...

The other one is exercise/workout, if I do too much (comparing with what my body can handle) I won't be able to sleep properly. After 2 or 3 hours of sleep I do wake up being fully awake like if someone did inject me something, unable to sleep or stay in bed.
And it's not that I do much... in fact I have been decreasing my exercise because of this with the course of the years.

Even after taking the sun for around 10 minutes it does causes me ectopic hearbeats, what's more natural than the sun?

**What could I do to improve this?** 

I have other issues/problem and sympthoms, but could someone bring some light into me with this? Would love to recover that range of ""handling stress"" that I had in order to improve my quality of life and then fight better to get fully rid of benzos and all what it does to me...

I’m three days into tapering and obviously am not feeling great. Pretty tired most of the time. Lots of family stress too because I ODed on New Years and outed myself as an addict after 5 years. 

Now I had a bunch of New Years resolutions and one of them was working out 3x a week. But between a 9-5 job, grad school, and family drama from this I just am completely zapped of energy. 

Before anyone asks why im not going to rehab my family said they will disown me if I do. 

So I guess the question is, is it worth it to just power through and try to work out despite the extreme tiredness or should I just keep chugging along as kicking benzos as my #1 goal until I am in a place where I can work out.

What should I do to prevent any sort of long-term damage, both with tinnitus and cognition? My dose was pretty low. Should I pick it back up and taper slower (over the course of months) to prevent damage or just stay where I am and not take anymore (I last took 0.25mg Friday).

I never take them with booze/other drugs recreationally. Just to help with sleep/anx.

I don't know anyone else who takes benzos (the person who got me in to them is no longer part of my life) so hard to gauge whether this is a problematic amount, or actually within safe limits.

My doses were between 1-3mg, depending on whether I used it for sleep or recreation.

After about how many hours after my last dose am I in the clear for seizures? I would imagine it’s within the first few days since the half life of Etiz is short but I’m not sure. Anyone have input? I would imagine I’m not a seizure risk because my withdrawal has been fairly mild but I still want to make sure.

Eventually my body couldnt handle it anymore, and I ended up in the hospital quite a few times. It was very bad. I am happy to say though, that I am currently 15 months clean from benzos and stimulants, and I am confident I will remain this way for years to come. If im being honest though, I still feel so fucked. My emotions are totally out of wack, when I have any besides frustration. I feel like I see everything from this awful, negative perspective. Its hard to explain, but I dont feel like my mind works the same way that it did before benzos, and its not good. I dont like who I am anymore.

It got so bad I was suicidal at times, depressed, and foggy. I withdrew once and it was hell on this earth. Well, being the crazy mother\*\*\*\*\*\* I am, I started experimenting and FOUND a combination that works for the withdrawal with a synthesis of ideas, backed by accurate studies and pharmacological fundamentals. I am also an anonymous medical student and actually presenting at a conference in a month with this idea- all a systemic review based on evidence-based medicine/naturalistics. Here is a summary of my research and findings- backed from NCBI. In addition, I have suggested these methods to some of my mother's friends and they have had success. However, everyone is different and its obviously important to discuss with your provider. I am NOT a know-it all so if you don't agree thats fine!

1.) **GABAPENTIN**\- Gabapentin reduces excitatory glutamate release during the BZD-withdrawal phase- reduction of glutamate release decreases AMPA activation and thus helps the withdrawal phase. These excitatory receptors are unregulated during the phase and thus any agent that directly or indirectly reduces this up regulation will help patients get off.  Their is evidence-based medicine supporting this claim and hypothesis I formulated. Please consult NCBI.

2.) **Skullcap**\- This is a naturalistic- however, it has been shown to have positive effects during the withdrawal phase and is a mild BZD-receptor agonist and may be of good value when getting off and then staying off!

3.) **Afabozole**\- This is the SHIT. Get it on amazon for about 30 bucks. Read the EBM- it has helped patients relieve anxiety and also come off of diazepam! I personally took it and it's amazing! Just dont expect to feel high! It does interact with the dopaminergic system during the withdrawal but is not associated with addiction.

4.) **L838-417**\- This drug actually acts as an anti-hypnotic with pro-cognitive benefits, but an anxiolytic (due to subunit selectivity). It has shown to be excellent in withdrawal, but yet is still in research. WTF is the FDA doing this?

5.) **BPC-157**: This has had quite a bit of studies during the withdrawal- it helps repair these delicate neurotransmitter systems and can speed up recovery. This also can help regenerate damaged neurons and may help clear up your fucked up mind.

Again PLEASE consult your doctor to make sure no medication interactions exist. If they are not sure, proceed. But my two sense- ALWAYS check reputable sites (NCBI, PUBMED) before ingesting a chemical.

Good luck- if you get off and stay off that is a miracle of the Lord.

I went through a couple of years of high dose rc benzos use about 6-7 years ago, and cold turkeyed. Mainly clonazolam, the sudden stop was beyond my control and know that's a contributing factor to the the current cognitive deficits, as well as both antero and retrograde amnesia I experience. Although I was clean from benzos for about 5 years, in 2021 I relapsed, but have kept my doses in a therapeutic range, am currently doing a sloooowwww taper. I am also sticking to prescribed benzos, namely Clonazepam, and veering away from sketchy unregulated RC's.

So I know I'll need to get off the benzos again to get my cognition and memory better. But I don't think it's ever been this bad before. I know exercise and a good diet will help, B Vitamins I need to take every day or there is very noticeable drop in my ability to recall information. 

I am also taking 600-900mg of gabapentin a day to help taper, and have read gabapentinoids antagonize mechanisms of neurogenesis. Noticed it with lyrica too, but gabapentin has been personally way easy to stop taking, so that's one thing I know will help. I'm doing a rapid taper of gabapentin right now, and have only consumed 300mg 2/3 through the day. So I hope that will help.

I am even going as far as too trial a month of nootropics like Semax and Fasoracetam, seeing if these problems cognitive problems can be attenuated by them. Solving drug induced problems with more drugs, yeah, doesn't feel completely right to me. But given the situation, and the mechanism of action of these drugs seems like it's worth a shot.

So I'm really asking the community, especially those who have messed around with potent RC benzos and became dependent, how have you dealt with and improved cognitive deficits and more specifically your memory?

I feel like I am in uncharted territory, and would really appreciate some tips. I am in job where I need to absorb a lot of engineering information, and in a life long ago before benzos, I was a young adult immersed in Music theory/ performance and other endeavors. I was pretty sharp. But not wise enough to know how to healthfully deal with emerging affective disorders. So I am into a whole new ballgame of memorizing things that are more of a STEM nature.

Permanent is scary AF especially since I already have anxiety/sleep trouble.

For option 3, prescription abuse, select that if you took significantly more than you were prescribed leading to running out before a refill or having to get some from elsewhere. 

For option 4, recreational turned prescription, I generally mean for those who got hooked recreationally and had to be prescribed to stabilize.

So you go to your GP and say that you re experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms from benzos and also btw you are an asshole for punting me on this medication to begin with! Then you find out that they have exactly zero knowledge of what a benzo taper might look like and also underestimate the ""side effects"" that you are suffering.

I am searching for advice as I have become extremely desperate. 
My little brother is 18, and has had a benzodiazepine addiction since he was around 14/15. It’s gotten extremely bad where he completely loses his mind, I walked into his room the other day and he had 50 blue tablets in his mouth and was threatening to swallow them all unless I got out and let him keep them it’s completely traumatised me. He has my parents hearts broke as well as mine and I don’t know what to do I’m so scared that he is going to die. 
Anyway, I want to know has anyone in here had any experience with benzo addiction and what helped them get off it? He has been to rehab, wouldn’t stay and left after a week. He’s tried every traditional treatment in the book and nothing seems to be working. 
So I’ve been reading about alternative treatments such as ibogaine, kambo, ayahuasca ceremonies etc. And I’ve heard that they can be very successful in treating other addictions, but so far I haven’t been able to find anyone mentioning these working for Benzo addictions. 
So my question is, does anyone know of any  of these treatments that may help or any other similar alternative ones? 
I want to get him the help that he needs before it’s too late.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7709379}"

Hardest months ever, my life basically imploded over night. 

I’ve also been on Mirtazapine since early November, and I’m at 15mg atm. 

The WD symptoms remaining are double/triple/blurry vision, headaches, some very light tinnitus, and just not feeling 100% yet in general. 

A lot of other things are gone, thank god, but I’m already getting worried about what tapering Mirtazapine will be like, idk if I can handle another terrifying withdrawal. 😞

I also woke up today feeling really down and gloomy. It’s like I’m too scared to look forward to 2022, I don’t want to jinx myself. Every time I thought things couldn’t get worse in 2021, they did. 

Idk, can anyone relate to this? I’m still too nervous to make any plans or commit to anything… I mean, I can’t enjoy much when my vision is still messed up. I feel a bit lost rn. I miss my life so much, it hurts.",6,{'vaccine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9453024}"

Then I got help from my doctor he gave me 28 days drop down 2mg a week till nothing this is when it all started to go wrong again. The rapid reduction has given me such bad withdrawals I’m scared when I come off them for good I’ll get protracted WD. I’m currently snapping my 10s into quarters so 2.5mg daily.. should I go back up to 10 and start slowly again or should I carry on as I am drag this out till my body adjusts and reduce again when ready? what are your opinions I’d like to know.

For the last 8 or so months I have been taking diazepam (antonex) on and off.

This is because i am an alcoholic and every few weeks I would binge heavily and have to go to the doctors for alcohol withdrawals and get usually 25 5mg tablets.

In the last 2 months I’ve gone down to 2mg trying to taper off with help from my doctor.

About 7 days ago she gave me 50 2 mg tablets and I am currently alone with my family in a different country so Christmas was very hard for me and i very stupidly drank heavily over the period of 3 days. But even more stupidly was taking the diazepam at the same. I tried to wien off after I had stopped drinking and had about 20 tablets left and was taking half a 2mg tablet every few hours tablets until i ran out about 48 hours ago. The alcohol withdrawals seem under control and at the moment I’m feeling okay with a headache and sweating. I’m taking lots of vitamins of water, and managed to sleep on and off last night. Just feeling really down an a bit anxious at the moment. I just want to finally stop alcohol and stop benzos 

I can’t see my doctor again to Monday and worried I might have seizures. Is taking how much I have over the last 2 weeks going to give me a bad time?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6063683}"
