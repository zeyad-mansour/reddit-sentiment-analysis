Have been stuck at 26mgs since October, that's when benzos got out of control. I needed 3mg xanax just to stop major symptoms. Months later got a doctor who would help me and she gave me clonazepam. I abused it, and now my tolerance is fucked. Also, it didn't last me 24 hours. So now I'm in the process of transferring everything to Valium. This is what I take now, 2.5(3)mg klon, 2mg xan, 20(30)mg val. Parentheses are for what I actually take, I take an extra .5 clon and extra 10mg val from my prescriptions because my doctor won't let me be comfortable. Ya, it's all a lot of benzo, 13 pills and it's not enough. I've only managed to replace a single Xanax pill in like a month with 2 valium pills, is it supposed to take this long? and with twice the dose? I tried going down half a Xanax today, feel terrible. 

I don't stand a chance in hell getting off methadone this year, much less next even if my doc is going to give me an extra klon and an extra val. It's extremely important to me to get off of methadone because the side effects are ruining my life and they are untreatable. I don't know what to do. I take a ton of Gabapentin every night, without that I'd be in gabapentin wd, but that is sustainable and I'm not planning on ever really getting off of it. It like maybe helps with 10% of the wds, but it's great for methadone wds, Clonidine is fantastic for benzo wds, I'm using it for sleep though if I don't use that all at night, I won't be able to sleep. Maybe I could find a replacement, but I don't know, I hate all the side effects from all the other sleeping meds, save maybe Trazadone. 

I'm in dire straights, Opiate withdrawal AND benzo withdrawal every single morning I wake up, the two withdrawals are VERY similar, the starting symptoms are almost identical, and because of that they feedback on one another making them worse than the sum of their parts, thus my withdrawals are worse than they really should be. I have to take care of one before the other, but who would ever prescribe me like +15 pills worth of benzo... There are fucking methadone clinics that give you HUGE amounts of opiates, why the FUCK isn't there anything similar for benzos??????????? FUCK. I've never wanted to murder myself more, and trust me that's no idle threat.

Clonidine works so well, but it lowers the fuck out of my blood pressure and I'm always fainting. I'm at .7-.8mg with that. I don't think I'd be able to get propranalol becase of that low blood pressure. Someone please tell me there is another drug out there that will make my benzo wds not hell.",1,0

I came back to my house and sobbed. I hate being this way. My nervous system is sensitized to withdrawals than anyone i’ve ever heard of. I’m so anxious and every pump of the bass coming through the walls is like a punch in the stomach.

April 22 I began tapering. At first I tried skipping a night and felt horrible, shaky and disoriented. So I settled on a reduction to 4mg. I held steady at 4mg for only a couple days before dropping to 3mg. Within the first 9 days, I had reduced from 5mg to 3. I know, probably too fast but what's done is done. 

That was about 4 weeks ago and things have been slower from there. I made a reduction from 3mg to 2.5 and held that for a week. Then I dropped from 2.5 to 2 and held that for two weeks. About 1 week ago I dropped from 2 to 1.5 and I plan to stay here for at least another week. My cuts will get smaller as my overall dose does. I really base it on how I feel as the week ends. I don't make a jump unless I'm feeling pretty good. 

Etizolam has been.. interesting.. to taper with. Blister packs or not, you're never 100% sure about the chemical structure or strength. Over the years, I definitely felt different results from one brand to another. While on the 1.5mg dose (and stable) I decided to switch from 2mg pills, to using 1mg pills. (I have more of the 1mg tablets and would need to switch to them at some point, anyways, to complete tapering). They're different, y'all. I was stable and am now experiencing the withdrawal symptoms that I typically get a few days after a cut. Aching jaw, pounding chest in the morning, irritability. You know. Nothing unmanageable but I can't deny that there is something different from brand to brand. 

Anyways, just wanted to give an update. I'm still alive, haven't given up yet and I'm not going to! I know a lot of people are facing a similar situation right now since the etizolam import/ export ban but it IS possible to taper off this junk. I can feel my brain starting to fire up again, like a rusty old engine sometimes but I know I'll get it back. And so will you. We, collectively, have got this ;)",22,0

Yesterday I had high BP, extreme exhaustion and felt flush in the face for an hour. I called the on call doctor who advised me to break my 1mg tablet in half and take that amount for a few days. After finding this thread, I think my exhaustion was caused by a combination of Clonazepam and daily intake of caffeine (coffee, preworkout, monster).

20,2021-05-29 13:18:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nnrzp2/crude_explanation_but_it_will_help_you_understand/,"Crude explanation, but it will help you understand.","Glutamate and GABA are the brain’s major “workhorse” neurotransmitters.

Over half of all brain synapses release Glutamate, and 30-40% of all brain synapses release GABA.

GABA and Glutamate regulate action potential traffic.

GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, stops action potentials.

Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, starts action potentials or keeps them going.

Since GABA is inhibitory and Glutamate is excitatory, both neurotransmitters work together to control many processes, including the brain and body's overall level of excitation.

Tranquilizers (Benzodiazepines), Alcohol and Z-drugs like Ambien increase GABA activity. (Calming the CNS)

Alcohol increases GABA activity. (short lived and does not bind as tight or as long as benzos)

Alcohol decreases Glutamate activity but it spikes back higher when the alcohol wears off (hangover, anxiety and tremors the next day).

Caffeine increases Glutamate activity. Caffeine inhibits GABA release. ---> (You feel anxious, wired, wide awake)

Benzodiazepines (as well as alcohol and Z-drugs) effect GABA by unnaturally boosting it's release and keeping it attached to the cell's GABA attachment sites (resulting in sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. Conversely the body produces more Glutamate to compensate for the now elevated levels of GABA being utilized and being kept bound to the cells. The body demands to stay in balance in a homeostatic state.

However, Benzodiazepine use over time down-regulate your cell's GABA receptor attachment sites since the body doesn't need to work as hard to utilize it's own organically produced GABA. (The receptor sites become clogged, start to malfunction, or are reabsorbed by the body due to GABA/Benzo redundancy and over sedation)

When Benzodiazepine Tolerance hits (the medication starts to fail) your GABA utilization slows down and it’s like you’re slowly letting off the brakes on the now elevated Glutamate system. This causes Interdose Withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, panic, etc. (even though you are taking your medication as prescribed). Doctors will prescribe more of the Benzodiazepine to compensate for this event (Up- Dosing), or prescribe an SSRI Anti-Depressant or SNRI but your body will soon hit tolerance once more and the Interdose Withdrawal is back. This is an endless cycle which must be avoided.

If you Cold Turkey (abruptly quit taking) your Benzodiazepine, Glutamate levels spike (no brakes) and the excitatory neurotransmitters go nuts causing insomnia, anxiety, panic, muscle tightness, elevated heart rate, muscle twitches and many other horrible side effects. This could also lead to fatal seizures. Do. Not. Do. This!!

Your cell's GABA receptors, now damaged, malfunctioning or missing due to benzo use must ""Up-Regulate"" (heal or repopulate) back to their original, natural, non-medicated state before they can once again function properly balancing out GABA and Glutamate utilization in your body. Only time and patience can heal/regrow GABA receptors once the medication is completely out of your system. Your body replaces approx 40 billion cells a day, but the over all system the benzos damaged is approx 100 trillion cells.  This is why recovery takes time.

Slowly tapering off of your Benzodiazepine over a long period of time is the only safe, logical and bearable method to rid yourself of Benzodiazepines and restore your health/homeostasis.

For most of us it took years to get into this mess and it's going to take time, patience, self- loving, gentleness, understanding and determination to get out of it. Slow and steady wins the race. Try not to fear what side effects might occur as you taper off. Everybody is different therefore the experience of withdrawal, for you, will be different as well. Just take it a day at a time.

P.S. .5mgs of Klonopin, or .5mgs of Xanax, or 1mg of Ativan are not low doses.. they all equate to 10mgs of Va|ium.. If you have been taking any of these medications for more then 3 weeks you are already physically dependent and cannot just stop. The record for physical dependency is 9 days. Additionally, some people take years to reach tolerance, some over a decade, while others can hit tolerance in a matter of weeks or less. If you require more and more of the medication to experience a therapeutic effect, you are already in tolerance. Slowly tapering off is your only option. Look up Liquid Titration of Benzo, or Dry Cutting Benzo to start your education. Do not taper faster than 5 - 10% of the dose per month.

Lastly, what is tolerance?!  Simply put, in part, when you started benzos, (or alcohol, Z-drugs) all of the GABA attachments sites on all of your cells worked.  Constant use of Benzos, (just like constant use of alcohol) started to burn out/clog up the receptor sites on a majority of your cells.  The body, to combat the constant onslaught of a GABAergic substance, i.e. benzos, alcohol, z-drugs, etc., signaled itself to produce new replacement cells with these GABA receptor sites being less plentiful or shut off, as a means of protecting itself, mainly from respiratory arrest and to maintain a working Flight Or Flight System.  How fast a person's body starts to augment (absorb) the receptor site population, or to shut the receptor sites down, is genetic and why every single person hits tolerance at a different rate, some taking years.  As mentioned above the body replaces approx 40 billion cells a day.  The entire body contains approx 100 trillion cells.  When the population of cells with damaged, malfunctioning, or shut off GABA receptor cites reached about 1/4th your body started to experience interdose withdrawal.  When this population hits over 50% or so, tolerance is achieved.  The same thing happens with alcoholics.  We’ve all known those persons who can drink huge amounts of alcohol and still functions with little interruption.  That is tolerance to a GABAergic substance.  It’s not that the substance isn’t there. It is the person’s cells no longer have the ability to utilize that substance and so it’s like it doesn't exist. Make sense?  

Recovery is the body once again producing replacement cells with functioning GABA-A attachment sites and the body returning to normal operation, or homeostasis.  This can only happen once substance use is stopped and enough time passes for the body to replace enough of the damaged cells for the entire system to start working again.  This. Takes. Time. Do the math.  Approx 40 billion cells a day are replaced.  Population of cells impacted which needs to be repaired or adjusted approx 100 trillion.  This cannot be rushed.  There is no magic bullet, or trick, or life hack.  This has to happen organically.

I am tapering Valium for some time and now I am holding at 2.5mg to stabilize.

The major thing is, I arrived at a point in my taper that I have little mental stamina, I am mentally fatigued.

Doing stuff with too much stimuli makes my right temple feels like it's burning... it's as if someone was putting acid inside my brain.

I can barely play chill videogames like Stardew Valley, I can't watch TV for too long. I am only productive for like 4 hours of my whole day, and the time I take Valium it kinda mitigates a bit this overheating feeling.

I ask this because Idk if I should treat like burnout and stop everything and maybe even quit my work (I work as an statistician... lots of programming and design of experiments). By the end of the day I feel slammed.

I even asked to work only part time but I wonder if this will be enough.

Last year I began suffering from severe tmj pain. I relied on otc painkillers to cope with it. I started physiotherapy but it didn’t really help much. At one point the physio suggested trying a muscle relaxant but I didn’t think much of it at the time. By last February the pain had gotten so bad I had to take time off work. I was basically just lying in agony at home with stabbing pain down my jaw and neck. I asked my gp if I could try a muscle relaxant, they told me they weren’t generally prescribed for tmj but gave me a prescription for baclofen anyway without explaining how to use it or any of the risks. I took 3x10mg a day for three days as that’s how much it said I could take on the label. It helped a bit with the pain and tension but made me completely lethargic so I stopped. 

Just to be clear I had never used gabaergic drugs before this and had no idea about withdrawal or kindling. I naively assumed that my gp wouldn’t have just handed me something that had long term risks. Two weeks after this I had a bad flair up, I took 30mg again on the Monday and Tuesday. I wasn’t able to sleep after stopping but put this down to pain as I’d been having disrupted sleep before baclofen. I asked for some other medication and was given amitriptyline which I took on Thursday, Friday and Saturday that week at 10mg. It made me sleep 12 hours but had vivid nightmares and made me feel off which in hindsight probably had more to do with baclofen withdrawal. 

The day after I stopped amitriptyline I began experiencing an electrical sensation in my head and couldn’t sleep at all. The next morning I began to experience violent tremors and tachycardia as well as a burning sensation all over my body. I was taken to accident and emergency where they tested my blood which came normal and was told it was all a psychosomatic manifestation of anxiety as amitriptyline wouldn’t have triggered that reaction. I tried to explain about the baclofen as well but was basically told it was all in my head and that I just had to wait it out at home. 

I didn’t sleep for an entire week after that. Another gp prescribed diazepam up to 6mg prn a day. I continued to experience tremors and non-epileptic seizures for around eight weeks after this until I no longer needed to use diazepam. During this time I began to have psychotic episodes where I would run around screaming that my brain was being raped with a cattle prod, I attempted to throw myself out of a window at one point. 

After this I was made to take mirtazapine which induced severe akathisia for a week. My whole family were convinced I’d had a psychological breakdown as they’ve always thought there was something wrong with me and my attempts to explain that I was experiencing a drug withdrawal fell on deaf ears as they refused to believe this could happen from ‘just taking a few pills’. My uncle even tried to get me committed to a psych ward which I only narrowly managed to avoid. I am currently being forced to attend hypnotherapy sessions as my parents are convinced this has all happened because of repressed memories of childhood trauma. 

Thankfully the acute withdrawal seems to have passed, I am no longer experiencing shaking fits and haven’t taken diazepam in over two weeks. However, I feel permanently broken like I am just not the same person as before. My emotions have disappeared, I feel constantly depersonalised, I can’t enjoy or focus on anything I used to. I used to be an avid reader but now I can’t even get through a page without the words becoming a jumbled mess. My favourite music now sounds grating and unpleasant. I have had to quit my job. I can’t bring myself to do anything other than sit and stare out the window. The only part of the day I look forward to is going to sleep even though I have nightmares and frequently wake up with palpitations. 

Physically I am a wreck. I’ve gone from 5’10” 140lb to 120lb despite having virtually no body fat beforehand. My muscles are all spastic and ache. Every time I move my body my joints audibly crack. Idk whether I had rhabdomyolysis but even my face looks completely different like my maxilla is sunken and all the muscle tone has gone. Even basic tasks are exhausting, all my limbs feel like lead and I can’t grip things without painful pins and needles in my hands. Even if some of these symptoms eventually improve I feel like I’m never going to go back to normal. 

I feel like suicide is my only option at this point. Obviously it would traumatise my parents but would that be worse than forcing them to care for an invalid the rest of their lives? I tried to practice partial hanging but it was too uncomfortable and felt like my head was going to explode. Overdosing is impossible without an antiemetic and I don’t have access to a gun. The only realistic option I have is jumping in front of a train but even that isn’t ideal. Feel completely stuck tbh.",3,0

After a few days I dropped the temazepam but took 1mg alprazolam for a couple of nights, and dropped the phenibut to 0.5g for the last couple of days and 0.25g today.

The main issue I have with this is that after burning out or in other words not being able to do something in a way that you thought you could, it's way way too easy to fall down and completely lose motivation for the following day or so.

So ideally one would avoid burning out and avoid that disappointment, but is that feasible during wd? What do you guys think?

What would you do?,"Im feeling hopeless as I just reinstated my klotapin after 2 half months but only because my dr after 3 weeks basically going cold turkey in rehab I was bedridden like you were. I did 21 days in a shitty rehab they tapered me with Ativan for two weeks but was bedridden after the klotapin wore off, after it wore off I was like you I literally went into a state of phycosis even with the 1mg of Ativan. I laid in that bed in rehab for another 7 days straight only getting up to make myself try and eat something to stay alive and go to the bathroom and shower every 3 days. They wouldn't give me nothing but gabapentin which did nothing!!! So I stopped taking it and hydroxazine which did nothing!! I felt so bad i literally couldn't even leave if I wanted to my truck was in the parking lot i drove myself there. But I was so out of it and this dark evil cloud of depression over me wouldn't allow me to check out i just laid there praying to God and talking to my room mate telling him to tell the nurse I needed help (they never came)I finally on my day I was suppose to graduate I was so angry with staff neglecting me not checking on me , I could of easily seized and they wouldn't of known and making false promises to me , not letting me call family that was a rule 1 phone call a week with your counselor my family didn't even know how bad my condition was and they kept trying to make it look like I was just having a hard time !! No mfs im dieing in this bitch!! I literally finally  threatened to kill myself i had begged them to take me to the hospital for days straight and they wouldn't unless I said I was suicidal so I finally did!! fuck graduating, I left worse then when I came in. Moral to this part of the story is there isn't a rehab out there unless you have big money that will taper you properly and let you stay 6 months to a year or what it should take,  so those thinking rehab is the way to go for benzo withdrawl it isn't. Everyone else was coming off dope and happy on suboxone. It was horrible watching everyone happy as I suffered because I was going through benzo withdrawl. I ended up getting taking to the hospital who didn't do shit for me for 2 days and told me I couldn't no way still be withdrawling!!  I was released ,my father picked me up im a 36 year old man with a fiance and kids and I didn't wanna go home in the condition I was in around them i was that bad. I literally laid on my dads couch for weeks begging my dr to put me back on becsuse I made the mistake and didn't taper properly she refused saying it had already been 3weeks off and i made that decision fml. She finally gave me libruim I took it for a week and it wasn't touching me finally she decided with another doctor to put me on suboxone to give me some kind of dopamine because I was so bedridden I couldn't function get dressed shower shave eat nothing  I also in the past had opiate problems she was aware of but only self medicating to fight the anxiety. The suboxone helped enough to to stop the suicidal intrusive thoughts because 3 times i put my gun to my head and almost pulled the trigger but I kept thinking of my 10 month old son. I swear it was like devil was telling me to go to the closet get my gun drive and shoot myself I did that exact thing 3 times. Soon as they put me on suboxone I felt a tad better but now im addicted to suboxone. Even with the suboxone I couldn't take the shakes and tremors, twitching, Agoraphobia,  trouble breathing she finally agreed to put me back on 3mg a day of klotapin. And I swear its Barely doing anything. My mind is just fried from anxiety. I hate myself for this the only reason I went back on was because I had been in the librum anyways so i was like its not like I'd been benzo free and If im gonna be off I want off if im gonna be on put me on. Plus I have to return to work in a week. So I wasted 3 months of my life in hell suffering,  my relationship is falling apart she isn't really supportive,  and im now stuck on suboxone and klotapin and Celexa and seroquel. I dont know what to do. Im trying to only take 2mgs of k instead of the prescribed 3 . Bevause i dont feel like its helping much anyways and my depression is getting worse. Any advice would sure be appreciated..thank you all for listening and know I never abused my meds and have a family and a 10 month old little boy who depends on me. I just want to be normal but im scared to wean and not be able to function hold my job as im suffering already on. Also keep in mind I have underlying anxiety thats why I went on benzos in the first place,  it was last resort after trying so many different ssris that made me worse I ended up with permanent eye floaters from cymbalta or changing too many different meds at once. So it's like I need something to help but I dont want to make things worse.

I started on 5mg xanax, transitioned to clonazepam at 2mg and then transitioned to diazepam at 0.25mg clonazepam. I stopped my taper at 2mg diazepam (ran out of tablets - I’d of carried on down to 0.5mg diazepam if I could of) on the 20th April 2021. 

It’s been 37 days since the last dose of my taper and I feel amazing man! I wanna give a big thank you to everyone who helped me, through this subreddit. I’ve tried to stop so many times in the past but never managed to ever properly stick to a taper and stop. The help of this subreddit is appreciated massively! I don’t think I could of done it without you.

The feeling of being free from this terrible drug is better than any other feeling though, hands down. Trust me, I used to think it was impossible to get off benzos. Here I am - 37 days clean! The fact I can say that is amazing man, I’m so proud! You can do it, trust me!",28,0
52,2021-05-27 17:35:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nmi9sr/how_long_should_i_stay_off_of_benzos/,How long should I stay off of benzos?,"So a backstory for context. **(READ TLDR IF YOU WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT)** I've had unexplainable flank pain that prevented me from sleeping. Years of medical research in a hospital ended up nowhere. Painkillers did work, but made me functionally useless during the day. I figured out that sleeping on my back doesn't hurt, but I've slept on my side my whole life so that was extremely difficult. I asked my doctor for some sleeping pills, and prescribed me temazepam. These helped me sleep on my back. But since my benzo use is not intended for therapy (such as CBT) I had to pay for these myself, and doctors do not prescribe benzo-based sleep aids for longer than two weeks.

I quickly realized that benzos are excellent during periods of work-related stress as well. I decided to go look on the RC market to see what was available - no prescription needed and far cheaper. I started using etizolam last July for both sleep and work related purposes. Rapid tolerance led to me taking 5 mg per day. For sleep they were useless after a couple of weeks and I noticed a rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms if I did not get my dose in time. I decided to quit them at the end of August, I had finished a major project so I had a week off. It just so happened that at the beginning of the same week I caught the stomach flu. I quickly realized that I could not go through withdrawal while simultaneously being extremely sick for a week. At that point I realized I was going deeper into dependence, and since I had to go back to work I could not really afford to stop, because for the next six months I had to do a years worth of work because of the coronavirus.

It wasn't long before I took clonazolam. The first time I took it (0.5 mg) it knocked me out for a good 16 hours. So I figured taking etizolam during the day and clonazolam in the evening was a good way to go. Eventually I felt no effects from etizolam at all, and just switched to clonazolam entirely. I suppose I took about 1 - 2 mg of clonazolam per day, and no I've never had any blackouts or memory problems. The worst thing I experienced was that one night I forgot to turn off the lights.

Extended use of clonazolam did ruin my sleep architecture as I noticed that - although I did sleep for long enough - sleep was no longer as restorative, because it ruins the REM phase of sleep. I also tried flunitrazolam (0.25 mg for the night, plus 0.5 clonazolam), again it helped me sleep for a while but eventually it was the same deal as etizolam and clonazolam. I lived this way for months.

I figured I cannot keeping going on like this, and missing a dose of clonazolam or flunitrazolam was giving me severe withdrawal symptoms. So I switched to a long-acting benzo called diclazepam. In hindsight I should have shifted to diclazepam WAY sooner, maybe even started with it. This benzo once again improved my sleep. Eventually I stopped taking clonazolam and flunitrazolam altogether, as I needed far fewer redoses. I recall I started with 5mg per day, but I realized I can't stay on benzos forever. I am tapering off currently myself, reducing doses by the week, and I am currently at about 0.75 mg of diclazepam per night. Only withdrawal symptoms I have noticed is moments of severe fatigue during the day that sort of blow over, and clenching teeth. I feel like I no longer need benzos for sleeping on my back, nor for stress/anxiety since I completed all my projects. (with great success I might add) So I want to quit.

**TLDR:** I'm preparing to stop using benzos on monday, currently going stable at 0.75 mg diclazepam with few issues, but coming from about ten months of heavy (but non-recreational) use of etizolam, clonazolam and flunitrazolam, my question is how long do I need to wait before tolerance returns back to normal? Can severe withdrawal symptoms still occur even if I tapered? Personally I do not experience euphoria from using benzos and so I want to use them again in the future (in moderation) for functional purposes. What led me to become dependent in this case is an unfortunate combination of circumstances and ignorance of longer-lasting benzodiazepines.

I am on a prescription of .5 mg alprazolam to be taken twice daily as needed.  I always take it at night for sleep, but sometimes take another half during the day.  I’ve been on the same prescription for 32 years.  I am now almost 72 and my doctor has informed I’m on my last prescription and to begin tapering.  She said that benzos are not recommended for folks over 65 and she would be derelict in prescribing a medication that would be harmful to me.  That pill is very tiny and the only way I can taper is breaking it in half and reducing my dosage by 50%. I know the dosage is small, but the duration is long.  She recommended I try Goli Ashwahghanda gummies for anxiety.  Well, that gummy is a poor substitute and I’m having a difficult time with half a pill plus a gummy.  I have read studies that it can be dangerous for seniors to withdraw from benzos, since the process could cause strokes and heart attacks.  That’s not good either.

**1.** Understand that you have more power than you realize. Within each one of us resides an unstoppable force that can be harnessed to overcome incredible odds, and it tends to appear at moments of extreme struggle, such as the benzo tapering experience, which is where I first discovered this inner power.  
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2.** Let go of all resentments. I know it can be extremely difficult and many of you are understandably upset at what you have gone through due to the pharma industry, but in reality, these ill feelings do nothing for you and only serve to keep you feeling disempowered.

Though it may be impossible to believe now, this is truly a gift rather than a curse, for it will lead you to a true realization of what you are capable of. This is the experience through which you will ultimately find yourself.  
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3**. No matter what else may be said, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but you have to realize that it is inside of you. Although it may be difficult to understand, belief can be used as a tool, especially once you get past the initial phase of the post-acute withdrawal. 

If you are living in fear, convinced that your next symptom is only a couple of days away, you will never be free. However, if you believe with all your heart that you are already healed and free, it will come to pass a lot sooner than you think.  
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**4**. Though it goes without saying, as lots of different drugs, foods, or drinks can be triggering, practice extreme discernment when it comes to what you put in your bodies.  Lots of commonly accepted foods and beverages are extremely detrimental to everyone, let alone people who are coming off benzos.

Once you have regained your health after your personal benzo journey, savour it and treat your body with reverence, for it was the faithful vessel that carried you through your hardships despite the toll that was taken. And besides… the human body is quite miraculous, and given the right fuel, it can heal at an incredible rate.  
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**5**. Happiness and health are directly related. From my own experiences, I found that the happier I was, the more I was able to heal, and vice versa. In the first year or so, I was left feeling quite low, but as I focused on regaining my health instead of dwelling on my pain, I gradually became happier. After my revelatory experience, which taught me acceptance and forgiveness, I found that my personal healing was greatly accelerated, as I no longer held longer held onto my pain or identified with it. 

I owned it but I no longer allowed it to control my life, and as a result it slowly dissipated. This interrelation of health and happiness is like an intrinsic reward system of sorts, because as human beings we are wired for these states.   If we have one, we seem to automatically find the other - it is only natural. Unfortunately, throughout the development of society, we have allowed other things to get in the way of these birth rights.

If you look at different cultures throughout the world, you will find that the happiest people also tend to be the healthiest and vice versa. In much of Western society, we are detached from any semblance of our natural way of being, which is living our lives on our own terms rather than following another person's (or society's) ideas for us. 

We all have our own gifts and strengths that we are meant to share with others, and they constitute a significant part of our reason for being. We were born into these lives to experience happiness through the sharing of our unique gifts, talents, and personalities with others, not to suffer in misery because we were never given the chance. In some ways, we as a people have forgotten how to be happy. 

I believe that this is the main reason that many of us sometimes seek pleasure in destructive ways, which is why it is so important to rediscover what truly makes us feel happy and fulfilled. 

I know that the tapering journey and protracted withdrawal are extremely difficult to handle, but if you can find the strength to engage in activities that bring you pleasure despite your withdrawal/healing, I believe that you will be rewarded with reduced symptoms.  It may seem like an impossible task upon first reading about it, but it is truly worth a try.  You may be pleasantly surprised, or dare I say ""happy"", with the results.  
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6**. Find your own dreams and hold onto them with all you might. What would you like to do when you free yourself from benzos? It could be anything from taking a nice walk in your favourite park to obtaining your master's degree... the options are limitless as long as you are willing to believe in yourself and your dream and take the steps to make it a reality.

Once you believe and focus on your dreams within yourself through imagination/visualization, it automatically becomes real to you on some level, and all that remains is to enact these changes in your physical life, which is surprisingly simple once you have a firm image of your desired results implanted within your mind.   
 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7.** Benzodiazepine withdrawal, as well as life itself, is entirely subjective, and though there may be similarities between experiences, your healing journey is entirely your own, and as such, there will be differences as well. In this respect, it is important that you refrain from focusing too much on others' negative experiences as if they will inevitably happen to you as well.  By doing so you are doing nothing but increasing the likelihood of their occurrence. 

Though it can understandably be extremely tough due to the anxiety and fear that goes along with withdrawal and increases one's susceptibility to suggestion, I recommend that you attempt to do the opposite instead, and focus on your dreams as mentioned above, and how your case will be different.",38,0

I've been trying to figure out the best way for me to get off my current prescription (see my previous posts for more info, but it's alprazolam 0.5mg 3x/d and temazepam 15mg at night).

Right now my options are: 

1) straight taper the alprazolam slowly and carefully (per Ashton percentages) and deal with the temazepam afterward. This might be done with help from my psychiatrist, or perhaps on my own. He's already said he wouldn't switch me to a longer acting benzo, and gave me straight alprazolam taper plan, but it's a weird and lousy plan I am not going to follow. I'm going to talk to him and see what he says about a more reasonable taper.


2) I found a benzo wise doctor who will cross me over to something longer acting (either Klonopin or Valium). They are located out of my state but have the ability to prescribe in my state. They seemed great during the conversation, and it was presented as being a very collaborative process.

Considerations:

1) I've read conflicting information and the pros and cons of tapering using your current benzo vs. a crossover. I'm not thrilled about the short half life of alprazolam and the likelihood of interdose withdrawals, but I'm also not sold on the crossover, with valium working on different subreceptors and the accumulation effects, as well as some folks just generally having a hard time crossing over.


2) The out of state prescriber is in a private pay practice. It's going to be expensive as hell. I'm alright with that part...but what if mid-taper they move to another practice, decide not to prescribe in my state any more, or something else interrupts the process? It was hell just to find them, and I'd be out in the cold and in a bind if something like that interrupted my taper/ability to get meds.

Wanted to give a quick update after being of the benzo’s for 9 months.

I spoke with a highly specialized doctor today when it comes to benzo withdrawal and he helps people in my country with the flumazenil injections. Anyhow, I learned that after taking benzos for a lof of people it takes 9 months BEFORE your cognitive functions start improving again. Insomnia lasts up to 1 year in most cases he claimed. Thought that might help some people.

Anyhow:

9 months off. Today I drove 1 hour on the highway without any anxiety which is a huge milestone for me. I am absolutey knackered after this hour and need to rest but I am proud that I did it.

What remains for me after 9 months:

- extreme fatigue. I can sleep entire days. Its really bad.
- sensitive eyes
- Afraid to be alone 
- Sometimes a low level of anxiety is still there but it’s peanuts compared to the first six months.
- tinnitus
- bad sinus problems remain eventhough docs cant find anything
- Falling asleep is problematic. Once I am asleep I can sleep for a long time.
- Muscle spasms are still there

What improved:

- my anxiety
- driving is possible again
- concentration improved
- can laugh more

All in all I hoped to be further at 9 months but it is what it is. Could be worse. I am in no state to work yet due to the fatigue.

Please help,"Over the last three months I have taken 1mg of Ativan two or three times a week to help me sleep. This usage had not caused any issue. Two weeks ago I had a traumatic event happen and began having a really hard time sleeping/grieving. I obtained 10 xanax bars to help ease what I was going through.  I took one 2mg bar each day for 8 straight days.  The night after I stopped I could not sleep at all. Then the next two following days I had bad sweats and felt very anxious. I really did not put two and two together until I took another xanax bar and the sweats and anxiety went away and I slept like a baby. Its about 30 hours since I took the last bar and Im starting to feel the anxiety and sweats build.  So I clearly am having some level of withdrawal or rebound issue when I stop taking  benzos. Is this just a xanax hangover which will go away in a few days?    I have about 30 one mg ativans and one 2mg xanax left.

So first off, too lazy to make a throwaway so I'm using my porn account I guess. Just don't look at my history, we've all got our kinks. 

Anyways, I've been weaning off Ativan by switching to Valium, before eventually tapering off Valium entirely.

I'm also on 50mg Luvox.

So currently I'm at 12 mg Valium, 0.25 mg Ativan, down from the initial 1mg per day of Ativan.

I really don't even need the Benzos for anxiety except for the rare occasion. But I'm physically addicted, so I only take them right before bed as they fuck with my brains.

Anyway, the more I up the Valium in response to decreasing the Ativan, the more tired I get. It's incredibly difficult to wake up in the morning. I'm super foggy and headaches are common. I take naps almost every day.

I need to fix this because my sleep schedule is way too abnormal. I sleep from 3am to 12pm and want to start waking up earlier so I can get a stable job, but it's just not working.

My current thought is to take a break from tapering while I reset my schedule, as it will improve my mood and lifestyle for future tapers.

I'm also looking into nootropics to ease things off. I am abstaining from alcohol, caffeine and excess sugar. But I'm vaping a lot of weed or taking edibles. I'd like to explore CBD but it gives me headaches. Similarly, I tried taking Pharma GABA tablets, and started feeling awful after a few days. 

Any advice? Am I going in the right direction here? I think lifestyle changes and some kind of supplement will be necessary for the next taper.

It's been:

* 5/1 - 0.5 mg
* 5/8 - 1 mg
* 5/14 - 0.5 mg
* 5/18 - 1 mg
* 5/22 - 1 mg

Could the nausea be a withdrawal symptom, or is this not a high enough level to trigger something like that? I've had the prescription for years but I've never taken more than maybe 2mg in a day (for flying - I HATE flying) and never more than a couple of days in a row. Usually it's 0.5mg - 1 mg and sometimes a couple of times a week, sometimes only a couple of times a month (if at all). And I didn't take any while I was pregnant in 2018.",5,0

I was cruising along with my Ashton Manual taper when I landed what I thought was my dream job. Pretty early on, though, I discovered it was a high-stress environment. Instead of leaving, I decided to pause my taper.

Fast forward a month. I left when that dream job turned into a full nightmare, and resumed my taper. I'm down from 60mg diazapam to 10mg, and I've been at it since December. This drop after pausing for a month has for some reason been the hardest. I'm disassociating so bad that it's difficult to type. I don't understand how I went from such a successful taper to feeling so out of it after a break. Part of me wonders if I'm not just feeling the major letdown off all that stress.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Does anyone have any tips on snapping out of it? I'll keep on tapering because I feel like the pause was the issue, not that I'm down to a lower dosage, but wow has this been a rough week.

Edit: I want to add a bit of encouragement if anyone's worried about working during a taper or post-benzos. My brain performed *like a champ* during that time. It was just too toxic an environment, and I was getting horribly depressed before I resigned. I look forward to finding a kick-ass environment in the future.",1,0

Please read, please","Please read to the end. I know this is long and I'm sorry. I'm begging you to please read. I'm in a really bad way. I can't eat food and it's getting to the point I can barely keep down stuff like Boost, Gatorade and even water. My lips are getting swollen and cracked. I wretch a lot. Lost 20 lbs now in 2 months. My stomach growls and I can't eat. I have constant tachycardia and when I sit or walk, tachycardia is worse and my blood pressure shoots up high. Cardiologist prescribed metroprolol but I can't take it until my daughter is safely out of the home and placed in a group home (she's 42, mentally a 6 month old). The metroprolol could lower my BP too much so I'm waiting for her to be placed. 

I was forced to go CT off 4 mg Ativan a day March 12. I took expired valium (didn't know the equivalent dose, started at 5 mg and got up to 25 mg/day) and it took about 3 weeks to stop the acute and I was able to eat again. Then my Dr reinstated me on Ativan. I didn't take the full amount because I was afraid he would cut me off again. Until that time, I didn't know benzos were addictive. Been on them 30 years. As soon as I got back on ativan at 50%, within a week I could not eat. So I eventually added expired valium, 5 mg. I did not want to go up on ativan. I think it is toxic. I could go up to 10 mg valium. But I'm getting worse. 

Would going back up to my original dose help even though it's been 2 months? Or increasing the valium since it helped before? I still have valium and could add another 5 mg to make it 10 mg day. I felt so much better on valium after it finally halted my CT and I could eat again. I found a benzo wise Dr 3 hours from me but right now I'm too sick to fill out online paperwork. He might not even treat me with the heart problems the CT caused. And of course, my husband thinks this is all in my head and he's been quite ugly to me. 

My son wants me to go to the hospital but there is nothing they can do for withdrawal. I can't talk to my Dr about this. His wife is the one that cruelly CT'd me and released me from his practice (husband got me reinstated as patient). At some point I will need a feeding tube.

You see I never “abused” benzos. I never bought bars off the street. I never ran out of a prescription early. Because I was just following the rules. Taking as prescribed (even taking less because I didn’t want to run out). 

But I guess I consider my case a bit more severe because my usage stems from 2017 to now. 

Right now I’m tapering, but I reached as high as 4mg/day prescription in the latter years. And I would take that on the weekends. 

It only took me 4 years to realize the situation I was in (yay me, right?). It took me several days to realize that it wasn’t going to be easy coming off. 

What I didn’t realize was the immense stress I was going to put on my loved ones. It breaks my heart to see my wife with tears in her eyes and she feels me shaking a little bit in bed (from tremors). 

Some days I wake up and immediately begin sobbing because the withdrawal hurts me. Then my wife comforts me. She tells me “You’re going to be okay”, she tells me over and over as I ask “Why did this happen to me?” She comforts me and I can feel tears falling from her face and landing on me. 

She tries to hide her tears but I see them. 

I tell her how sorry I am for letting this get out of control. I was only looking for anxiety relief at the doctors’ office. I didn’t know what dependency was, I didn’t know what withdrawal was. I didn’t know about any of that stuff. The doctor I trusted wrote me instructions and I followed them. 

I beg my wife “Forgive me, I didn’t mean for any of this to happen”. I feel so guilty for putting her through this. She’s my rock and I feel like I’m taking a pick-axe to that rock myself, actively stressing out our life with this withdrawal. 

She always reassures me that I’m not the one to blame. That she only wants me to be okay. She only wants to see my smile and will always be there when I need her. 

I don’t know how many times she’s called asking me how I’m doing just for me to break down in tears. Sometimes I tell her I can’t take it anymore. Sometimes I tell her about the nightmares I have. About the intrusive thoughts. About the endless random muscle jerks, the muscle pain and breathing difficulties. 

She always tells me “it’s temporary” & “I’m always going to be here for you - don’t be afraid to tell me what’s happening with you.”

I feel guilty for putting her through. She’s suffering because I am suffering. 

Benzo withdrawal is indescribable. But once I’m out, I’m never going back. Never again will I subject my family to such torture. It’s a hard lesson to go through. But one that I will remember forever.",15,0

5 years ativan use plus many unwitting gaba-ergic mistakes along the last several years that have done far more nervous system damage (I’m now super sensitive to tapering). 

Headaches, burning nerves, fatigue, back and neck muscle cramps bad enough to have me curled in a ball pulling at my hair, jaw clenching/pain, tinnitus that never ends, many digestive issues, stomach cramps like a charlie horse that last lasts hours, skin rashes that have spread to much of my body, unable to eat 90% of the food I used to due to unreal food sensitivities. 

Then there’s the typical symptoms: depression, anxiety, negative thought rumination, extreme irritability, memory and cognitive issues, and long periods of inability to experience joy or pleasure no matter what activity I do (anhedonia). 

All of this culminating in an unavoidable feeling of hopelessness, of permanent brokenness. 

I’m doing the Ashton Method. Gone from 1.5mg ativan to .22mg ativan + 13mg diazepam over about 6 months. It has been incredibly difficult just to get this far. This last reduction from 0.25mg to 0.22mg ativan has ripped through me like a freight train. 

— This morning —

I woke this morning with such bad muscle pain and weakness I almost fell flat on my face reaching for my robe. 

Took my am doses and ate breakfast. Couldn’t wait to get into a hot shower to ease my aching muscles. 

For some reason, especially in the shower I get into obsessive negative arguments with imaginary people I will meet, or people from my past. 

This morning I decided i’m going to use my time differently. 

If my mind was going to ruminate, I wanted to exert some control over what I was ruminating about.  I would say a phrase repeatedly, in order to short circuit the negative thinking. 

After trying several different phrases, I settled on “my spirit is strong”

So I said it... “my spirit is strong”about 20 times in a row. During... thoughts crept in like “this isn’t going to help you... you’re far too broken for words to have any effect, this is a sad joke”

But I kept repeating
“my spirit is strong” 
over and over. 2, 3 minutes passed. 

I kept noticing the negative thoughts trying to get in... but as the words “my spirit is strong” started to sound more like a heartbeat or a softly beating drum, the negative thoughts became much more quiet, until they weren’t there at all. 

After 100’s of repetitions, the words started to sound weird, like a strange collection of vowels, consonants, rhythms and notes that had no meaning.  

“my spirit is strong”
“my spirit is strong”
“myspyretesstrong”
“meispyrotesstrung”

more time passed 

The rhythm became the only thing in my focus. 

buh-duhduh-duh-duh
buh-duhduh-duh-duh

I became aware of how the tones of my voice were reverberating in my chest and head. It became my only focus. 

all at once I exploded in sobbing, weeping... still repeating “my spirit is strong!”... but my voice now in a crackling high pitched whining cry, short convulsions between each word “MY - - SPI — ret IS STRO-ONG”. The water from the shower hiding my streaming tears. 

Then quickly my emotions cut out and I was numb again. still repeating “my spirit is strong”.  Now the words were softer, my breathing was more labored, the words still coming out, sounding exhausted, but still persistent. 

I said the words several more times, then stopped. 

My mind was quiet. My body was sore, but calm. 

It had been two hours since taking my am dose, so that’s a factor. but my mind was ... unusually quiet. 

i’m writing this to you, sitting with the towel wrapped around me in the bathroom.  I’m looking at the various things in the bathroom. the sink.  The faucets. The decorations and various items on the counter. 

I’m able to just witness them. My mind quiet. at least for now. 

I wonder what will happen if I do this regularly.

He had absolutely no history of mental illness. But now his pretty unstable mentally. He did cold turkey off clonazepam last July after 3.5 years of use. 

So I guess my question is:

For those with no prior history of mental illness, did you develop any mental illness symptoms (mood swings, depression, paranoia, delusions, etc.) while on benzos?

Let’s say I wanted to just try to drink ok July 4th with family...am I taking a serious risk? Would the extra 5 months make a big difference?

I doubt I’d go crazy but maybe 2-3 drinks...

One part of me doesn’t think so, as even in the Ashton Guide she mentions it a few wouldn’t hurt.

Most of the calculators give an equivalency range, and man I've seen wild ranges, as low as 15mg temazepam = 0.5mg alprazolam up to 15mg temazepam = 3mg alprazolam.

Obviously, to think I am dependent on (in a relative/equivalency sense) 2mg alprazolam is bad enough...but the idea that the temazepam could make that actually closer to 4.5mg alprazolam is just mind blowing and totally disheartening, and will mean I have SO MUCH FARTHER TO GO after I get off the alprazolam.

When i’m anxious or depressed or just trapped in a void of feelingless-ness or in physical pain, I can’t relate to anyone. I can’t feel happy for them for the good things that are happening to them.

  Rehab was pretty hard. I got like a 5 day librium taper which I felt was really too short. I couldn't get my thoughts together the whole time and having bad shakes and tremors. It was hard being around all these other addicts who seemed to be getting better and looking forward to their futures when I knew I would still be feeling completely out of it for months to years. But am glad I did it as now places that didn't want to see me again have agreed to give me help. 
  I can't really do anything in this state. Just sit in my room watching TV or playing video games. I really appreciate this group for hearing that im not the only one going through this. I'd like to thank all of you. Seriously, benzo withdraw according to health care providers is like a couple weeks and you should be feeling better which is definitely not true for me. I see people post they can't go outside or function really. I thought some of these symptoms were just me going crazy. 
  So pretty much all I can say is benzo withdraw is in a league of its own. We should all get temporary disability but almost impossible to explain this. I just am having a much harder time knowing I have to deal with a DUI case. I don't know how im going to pay my fines and do all the other things that go with it.",33,0

Help and advice needed please.","As usual, long story, but the taper proposed by my new psychiatrist, although slow, is going to be out.

After talking with someone in the benzo community who is very knowledgeable, it seems the updosing/downdosing nature of it is likely to just kindle me more, and I'm not super stable atm. 

I'm going to talk to him (new psychiatrist), but I'm worried he's not going to budge on how he wants this to go. So I'm back to planning my own taper in anticipation of being on my own again. No access to valium or a longer acting benzo. I'm taking alprazolam 0.5mg three times a day and 15mg temazepam at night. Planning to leave temazepam alone for now and work on the alprazolam first.

Preliminary plan is to cut alprazolam 10% every two weeks and take temazepam at night as per usual.

My *biggest fear of all fears* is a seizure. I've seen some reports of seizure coming off of very low doses, as well as the more common high dose/cold turkey situation.

My concern is the short half life of alprazolam. Is there any chance that as I start to cut, the length of time between my 3 doses (roughly 7 hours between each dose) could precipitate a seizure?",3,0

I recently have been motivated to stop a 5 year benzo binge. I was prescribed Xanax for PTSD and all the underlying disorders that come with it. GAD, MDD, SAD. The list goes on.

Anyways, my doctor kept on upping the Xanax and as you would expect... it eventually stopped working due to the tolerance I had built while I was taking the 8mg a day that was prescribed to me. 

Living in a benzo haze and with crippling anxiety, worse than I had when I was prescribed, I seeked out stronger stuff. Clonozalam, flualp, etizolam and random pressed bars. Things got really ugly. My highest dose was probably around 60-80mg a day of flualp.

This brings me to last month. I pretty much hit rock bottom and started to taper myself off as my doctor seemed content keeping me on pills till I die. I worked my way from about 50mg of etizolam to 2mg of my prescribed Xanax. From 2mg I went to about 1mg a day in a month. Then the worst came.

I was taking .5mg of Xanax a day and thought I was in the clear. Man was I wrong. On day 3 I had a 13 minute seizure. I smashed my head, bit off about an inch of my tongue and really hurt my back. I guess my lips turned a greyish blue and my wife thought I was going to die. She called 911 and I had the paramedics take me to the hospital.

I explained to the doctor who saw my the whole shpiel that has been my life with benzo usage and that I had tried jumping off. The doctor gave me Valium IV, about 2.5mg and a prescription for 7 days of valuim.

Here is my question cause the doctor didn’t seem sure. If I take the valuim as prescribed and stop benzo usage again; how likely will it be that I have another seizure? I’m really afraid of having one and it’s making things rather hellish as I’m always thinking of having to put my wife through another one or if I die in her arms.

Does anyone have advice on how best I can navigate things from here? The doctor as mentioned didn’t seem certain but just told me to come back if I have another seizure. Ugh. I can stop at anytime, I’ve been through hell and back reducing this far but I just don’t wanna seize up again.

Thanks for reading and any suggestions you might have for me.",3,0

The extra pills that i'm buying off the streets cost me most of my money and it's really hard to find them because where i live there's very few people in town using or selling benzodiazepines and at the moment i've ran out of plugs. I really think about getting off them or at least i want to lower my daily dose without having withdrawals. I feel good taking them but i realize that this is just an artificial happiness that it gives my mind.

Anyone experience this?","I posted earlier about my timeline, and the question of whether despite reinstating before starting a very slow taper I could still be having PAWS-like symptoms, but I am curious about whether anyone has experienced this.

I'm currently taking my temazepam 15mg as prescribed, along with my BP medication, and a magnesium tablet, at bedtime. This has been my normal routine for a long time.

Around mid-March, I started waking up (honestly, it isn't like normal waking up, it's literally like being yanked out of a dead sleep), *always* between 4-5am, with very uncomfortable tachycardia. Usually my HR, when I check it 15-20 minutes later, is between 95-105. It will drop slowly over the course of a couple of hours to the mid-80's, which is my new normal since my accidental CT in early February.

It let up for a couple of weeks, but now for the past few days, it's back. It does not really fit criteria for a nocturnal panic attack (no significant anxiety, no sense of doom/dread, do not feel like I am going to die although it's incredibly uncomfortable, no sweating, no racing thoughts, no panic attacks in the daytime, etc ). It feels more like someone just gave me an adrenaline injection while I was sleeping.

I’m in for a rough ride for the next two weeks. I’ve been through many benzo withdrawls and I’ve done the Ashton taper and everything else you could possibly imagine during the most intense withdrawls (especially when I was using rc benzos) and I’ve always came out the victor but always fell back into the trap.... which well... leads me to today. 

So for the last two months I have been taking Xanax and klonopin probably at about 10mg a day dosage just because I had such an easy access to them and my addict brain kept telling me you’ll be fine just taper again like you did before (which was hell and caused me depression that was almost unbearable) but I still proceeded anyways. Now here I’am today with two 1mg k pins left and I’m getting super nervous because of seizures and what not. I’am not going to taper because I just want this to be over as quick as possible but I also have a decent amount of meds at my disposal for this two week period of hell I will have to go through (or maybe not?) so here they are: 

90x 300mg gabapentin
5 .5mg k pins in case of emergency
135 mg of methadone a day 
Some vitamins like niacin to help flush them out faster and a little magnesium and that’s IT. 

What should I do and what can I expect. Should I taper the gabapentin or only use as needed? The main reason I don’t wanna taper is because in three weeks I’m going on a month long planned vacation with a bunch of my friends and my girlfriend and everything is already paid for and as you can imagine I would like to enjoy my time there. 

Any other meds out there that anyone recommends to help make this process easier. I know the methadone and gabapentin will help big time but how much so? All help is good help I’m scared rn guys so please help me.

My husband has been in withdrawal from clonazepam since the end of July and it’s been pure hell for our family, and as a result our marriage is hanging by a thread. I have done all the research I can and understand that his brain is recalibrating. He is actually skeptical about the whole benzo withdrawal and believes all his symptoms have other sources. He became pretty delusional while on benzos and it got even worse in withdrawal. His skepticism lies in his delusions. But he actually had a window for most of March and April and I was finally feeling hopeful that things will get better, but sadly he’s in a pretty major wave right now. And with the wave comes the depression, anger, paranoia, being generally cold and mean, very withdrawn, inconsiderate, and blaming. We had a very good and stable relationship before benzos and withdrawal and my desire is to ultimately stay together. I just honestly don’t know how much more I can take, I’ve really really tried but he’s been so impossible to deal with. I’m the only one working, cooking, cleaning, and taking care of life stuff. The only positive thing he participates in is being a dad to our almost 3 year old daughter, but he checks out from that on some days. I can’t get into all the details of our issues, though I will say they all stem from benzos, but we were considering marriage counseling. However, I’m just not sure if it’s appropriate at this time. With his brain still in the healing process, will anything from possible counseling sessions stick? Will he even be able to participate effectively and apply things learned? Will he be able to process any of it? At this point, he’s still not taking very much responsibility for his faults and I just wonder if counseling will even make a difference. It’s really hard because he was so incredibly different before benzos. He was such a good, sweet, stable, and easy going guy. Super responsible and reliable. The kind of guy you could go to for help whenever. The memory of who he was is what i keep holding on to and hoping he will have some semblance to that at the end of all of this. But right now he’s basically mentally checked out. I was surprised I was even able to have a simple conversation with him to even bring up the possibility of counseling.

143,2021-05-21 01:28:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nhkxfx/recovery/,Recovery,"Hey guys. I haven’t been on here in around a year or so now, honestly it didn’t even cross my mind until now. I relapsed several times while trying to get clean from Benzos, Opioids and Alcohol, I was physically addicted to all three (although I could get by with one or the other of Alcohol or Benzos, naturally). I tried and tried, and in the process my wife left me (unrelated reasons, but addiction played its part), and I just lost myself. I ramped up dosages on everything over the course of the next 2 or 3 months, lost my job, got a DUI and went to jail, lost my truck, my apartment, friends, family, and like I said my wife and youngest son. When I got out of jail after the weekend, I went home and gave up. I regressed very quickly and ended up in a dark place and didn’t want to live or at the very least be conscious. So I dosed and dosed and drank and drank all day every day, and every day I would lie on my couch just using and crying, bawling even, and begging to just not exist anymore. I was absolutely at my worst rock bottom that I had ever hit, and I thought I had hit it several times before. I’m not sure exactly what happened inside me or inside my mind whether subconsciously or at some level consciously, but one day I told myself out of nowhere that I was going to try again. I called my aunt in Utah and my mom, both of whom had dropped little hints here and there trying not to push me but letting me know treatment is an option at the same time hoping I would change my mind. My aunt set everything up and I got absolutely blitzed out of my mind because I felt like I was giving up in a way, maybe because I couldn’t do it on my own. So two days later, my dad was picking me up from my apartment to take me down to Ogden Regional to their ACT (Alcohol and Chemical Treatment) facility, and for the first time in my life I checked into inpatient treatment in a state where I was alone with no chance of just leaving and walking home, no friends to pick me up, no family to pressure if it came to that, and these were the reasons I chose to go where I did. Something changed in me and I decided I didn’t want to die. At the point that I texted my aunt to set it up, I was puking at least three times a day, usually somewhere around 5 or 6, my body just was rejecting anything and everything and it was shutting down. I hadn’t eaten for 5 days, hadn’t drank more than a smart water bottle over the course of 3 days, hadn’t slept more than maybe 2 hours a night, hadn’t showered or left the apartment in over a week and was isolating from my wife who at the time was gone and family. My body was just rejecting anything I put into it, including drugs and alcohol. I could not keep it down and as a result I became more violently ill. I was a hollow body that just existed as a shell of a being. I had nothing to live for I felt, and no reason to stop using or killing myself. I don’t know what internal epiphany or resolve happened, but I followed through and rode with my dad to detox. I was in the detox unit for 3 days, during which period I still had a part of myself convinced that I was just going to do the 3 days detox and then come back home and do outpatient on my own. I had the most caring and compassionate counselor during my time period in detox. He checked on me constantly, gently probing me to learn more about me, and at the end of the 3 days he seemed like he knew me personally. He read me right off the bat and I trust him, so when he guided me to stay in inpatient there over the 3 days, on my last day he convinced me to stay. So they did my intake into the inpatient or residential unit, where I stayed for 28 days learning more and practicing skills and slowly getting my feet under me without being violently sick, just well enough to push through. My counselor was there with me every step of the way, all while he was determining my mental state and history, traumas and formulating a very concise insight and diagnoses before sharing them with me and helping me create a plan for treatment for both drug abuse and my mental illness to help me address everything I had repressed. I moved back in to my parents house after my 28 days in inpatient, as my wife and I were separated and I didn’t have a home to go back to. I stayed living at their house for about 5 months using them as a support system and a relapse prevention system. I felt confident but I knew relapse happens to the best of us so I kept my goals realistic. Last month, I moved out of their house into my own apartment after landing a once in a lifetime dream job in March, a job that I feel the chances of were next to nothing as I had more on my record now and hadn’t worked for about 5 months. I was offered the job and took it, I saved a bit for about a month and a half before I felt it was time. I put money down for an apartment while still living with my parents, and got some stuff moved over prior to moving in. My wife and I have been back together since December, we are doing couples therapy along with my therapy, and I am working my way through Intensive Outpatient. I currently have phased up to level 2 which means less classes per week and less responsibilities, I have a great job and a nice apartment, my relationship with my parents and my brothers is better than ever, I am reliable and more trustworthy and I feel again. I feel a love for my wife and sons more than the love I repressed before or numbed myself so much that I couldn’t feel it. I am doing great at my career and feel so much better, I look better and healthy again, and my loved ones are so proud of me which is a feeling I never thought I’d encounter again. I feel pride in myself for once, and I have confidence and as a result my anxiety has gone down. I feel competent, like I’m needed in my work and home life both, and I feel looked at as more of an equal than I have in a long time. I know this post is long and most of you won’t read the entire thing which is okay, I just wanted to get this out there and off of my chest as I haven’t really expressed the entirety of my recent life and world. I just want to say for anyone feeling hopeless.... brother I know. I know how hard it must be for you right now, and how much you’ve struggled. And the truth is I can tell you all day long that it gets better and how, but that isn’t going to matter as much to you as it does to me because you may not be able to see it. There is life and love and happiness after addiction and abuse even if you can’t see the forest for the trees right now. This group is amazing, and if you are reading this and struggling right now, reach out to me. I can talk about anything you want, or I can just listen. I want you to know you’re not alone. Thank you everyone for this group and I will be putting in more effort to be active in this group and help those in need. If you need to talk or just want a friend who understands, message me and I’ll give you my cell number. My name is Kris and I am 6 months 20 days clean today.",9,0

I had an accidental CT from prescribed benzos in early February. I was prescribed 0.5mg alprazolam three times a day and temazepam 15-30mg for sleep (for about 2ish years). I hadn't been taking the alprazolam as prescribed, I was using less, and my use was somewhat sporadic. I did take the temazepam nightly like clockwork, almost never 30mg, almost always 15mg.

Then I got prescribed 2 weeks worth of tramadol by my PCP to be taken at night for pain for a musculoskeletal issue, and was told not to take the temazepam with it. So, like a good patient, I didn't. And I didn't take much alprazolam that week either (maybe even none, I can't remember).

Anyway, over the course of a week I felt worse and worse. I now know that I was in withdrawal. I won't go through all the symptoms, you all know them.

Eventually when I realized what was going on (this was about 8-9 days out), I reinstated the alprazolam three times a day (thinking I should do what I had been told to initially by my psychiatrist) and after another week or so, I reinstated the temazepam too because I was off the tramadol and was still feeling like utter shit, I thought it might help.

Reinstating the temazepam didn't really help, and I've had nothing but problems since that time. The symptoms I'm continuing to have are consistent with PAWS, even though I'm back on the doses I was originally prescribed (and actually are higher than I was taking).

As you might imagine, I was PISSED at my psychiatrist about this whole mess, got an appointment with a new psychiatrist, and just started a very slow taper (you can see my previous post on that).

So I have been trying to work this out...am I still in PAWS even though I totally reinstated? Is that possible? And if so, what does that mean for my taper? Is it likely to be worse/harder because of this?

I appreciate any insight, I am just really trying to understand what's happening here.",5,0

Heart attack type panic, horrible sleep (though I slept every night), psychosis like dp/dr, palpitations, malaise, fucked up eating/digestion etc. turns out I was never anxious before benzos as I thought I was, just stressed due to an unmanageable life from untreated ADD. Withdrawal was a new anxiety like I had never experienced. Stayed off the pills for 1.5 months and things got a little less awful but still total dogshit. Started drinking every night I could to pass out and eating higher and higher doses of phenibut daily which did help but by the end of it I’d get the shakes once the phenibut wore off. Don’t do this. Ended up caving and blacking out on clonazolam and alcohol for half a week and ended up in the hospital on a 3 week fast Librium taper and that was it. Felt much better after the taper but still not fully back to normal. 

Now about 15 months out I’m almost fully back to how I was before, I just feel a bit less sharp post my benzo habit (I was really sharp before I used drugs). My anxiety is low, I can take a bunch of adderall to study for finals without downers and be totally fine, I can smoke weed and not feel like I’m having a heart attack (though I no longer do), and I can drink without any kindling. No more palpitations or heart related anxiety which is so nice and I now take it for granted. 

For anyone going through it my advice is to man up and tell a doctor and get on a taper. Don’t try to white knuckle CT like I did because it doesn’t work and you will cave unless your habit was minor enough to have weak WDs. Gabapentin helps for wd/PAWS once you’re over the taper. Don’t substitute phenibut it’s probably more dependence forming than Xanax in my experience. I could go on about supplements but really during acute WD they won’t touch your symptoms. Just get on a taper and if u don’t have the discipline to taper yourself go to detox.

So around January of this year I started taking Etizolam for anxiety. Previously I was prescribed Xanax but I was afraid to take it for some reason. I found Etizolam to be shorter acting and more clear headed.

Now months later I find myself dosing daily, waking up with muscle cramps and overall apathy and anxiety. Once I take 1mg of Etiz I feel much better and carry on throughout the day.

Recently I was prescribed Gabapentin and Lyrica. I was wondering if I could use these medications to come off of Etizolam. Has anyone else had success with this?

I also have Diclazepam if I I need to taper with another benzo. Any help is greatly appreciated. I hate the memory loss and general lack of motivation. Thanks!",2,0

Edit: if you dont know what diclazepam is, it's an rc benzo half as potent as clonazepam/alprazolam (so I was on the equivalent of 20mg of xanax/kpin daily) that metabolizes into delorazepam. It was very popular as a tapering benzo due to it's super long half life and little recreational value.",13,0

She has been using the farmaprm 2mg bars for about 1 month and i would say she uses the xans about 5 days out of the week with day breaks between the 5 days and usually every dose is either a half a bar or a full bar. Maybe 3 or 4 times shes chosen ti take another quarter of one but no more. So just recently she has stoped shards just cuz she was over it and recently she has gotten massive migraines and headaches that dont seem to be going away for days, also throughout the whole day she is feeling nauseous 60% of the day and she thinks that if it wasnt for the 30s and the xans that all these symptoms would be 10X worse...im worried about her and on occasion she says she feels like she might need to go to the hospital but then she realizes that its fine. My best guess is this is partly from coming off the the clear and its fucking with her brain and he body. Shes also worried that this could be caused by her not making enough bowel movements but she never goes longer than3-4 days without one.

Don't read if you get stressed easily.  Just needed to vent and get this off my chest.

I was prescribed .25mg Xanax in 2017, which ended up being 4mg/day Klonopin in 2020.

I made the decision to get off of Klonopin at the beginning of 2021.  To me it seemed like the right thing to do for my health.  Since then it's been nothing but fucking problems.  Not just problems.  These are fucking life altering problems.

My job performance has suffered greatly.

My mental health has deteriorated.  I'm in such a fucking panic everyday and wallow in a deep depression that brings me to my knees.

Today, I got chewed out at work, which made me want to fucking cry.  Back then I couldn't care less, today I want to disappear over an ass chewing.  What the fuck happened to me?  I'm tapering but holy hell and I a shell of a person now.

I wake up fucking crying most days.  I wake up shaking most days.  I can barely sleep.  My wife is stressed, my parents are stressed, I can't do my job properly, I can barely do anything properly.

I used to be so hopeful.  But months of suffering withdrawal from benzos is killing me.  I know it's going to have to get worse before it gets better but holy shit a person can only take so much mental torture.

Fuck benzos, fuck everything bro.  I just wish I had my life back.  I had no idea I'd fuck so much up at such an early age.  I was just a young man looking for anxiety & panic relief at 24 years old.  Now I'm 28, a shell of who I once was.  I was never a ""great"" person by any means but I wasn't the total waste of space I am now.  I have no motivation anymore, I barely have any will to live & this depression is dragging me so deep.  Not to mention the panic and anxiety - its incredible.  I've never felt this way in my life.

I have no idea what to look forward to anymore.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm physically & mentally depleted.  I need help.  Anything, please.",6,0

wondering if you guys can help me find some strategies to distract myself from obsessing over the idea of using. it's worth noting that I didn't have this problem before quitting cigarettes, but now that I've recently quit nicotine I've encountered a pattern that I guess I was addressing with smoke breaks and not realizing it.

I absolutely love my job, it's important to me and I do well at it, especially when it's busy. however, it's a desk job with little to no supervision and when my schedule isn't packed I often find myself sitting at my computer not paying attention and just obsessively cycling through thoughts of wanting to use/reminding myself not to use.

my job doesn't make me want to use (if anything has kept me invested in my sobriety), but sitting at my desk on a paperwork day/when I don't have back-to-back meetings is when the urges sneak up on me. some days it feels like I can't do anything other than concentrate on not using. that's all I can get done that day.

is this something that I have to ride out? is this relatable to anyone who quit nicotine while in recovery? does anyone have a helpful mindfulness practice or something to sort of shift my train of thoughts onto another track?

My problem originated in benzodiazepines, not alcohol. Being 15 months clean feels good and I feel better than ever, but I am still terrified of resetting my GABA-receptors through the accidental intake of alcohol (I sometimes drink 0.0% beer for the taste) even if the Ashton Manual suggests that one picks up 'normal' things like a glass of wine during dinner (during?)/after withdrawal.

I have little ambition to drink alcohol on a daily basis, even weekly. But I am curious to know whether it is safe to drink a glass or two on special occasions. My PAWS isn't entirely gone, so I will be focusing on recovery still the coming months. Still, a few questions remain unanswered that I hope someone that went through recovery can answer.

\- Can a glass or two of alcohol reset benzodiazepine withdrawal after the PAWS phase?

\- Does alcohol at all cause quick (physical) relapse?

I often read that people discourage it, but it is unclear whether it is the mental danger that resides in alcohol consumption or an actual physical danger.

(I would 'try out' a single glass to see how it goes, but I am frankly terrified of relapsing back a few months. I am unsure how sensitive the GABA system is.)",2,0

Please read to the end. That's where my questions are but the background is important.,"I made the mistake of reinstating at 50% ativan, 2 mg instead of 4 mg/day. I was/am terrified my PCP will CT me again (actually his wife did and lied and got me fired but my husband got me reinstated). I had slowed my CT by taking gabapentin, Fiorinal with codeine and expired valium. Before the valium worked, it was horrible and I had near stroke level BP and tachycardia and a ton of other symptoms like getting hit by a train. After the valium took hold 2 weeks in, I could eat again and the TERROR of CT subsided. But since I went back to ativan, almost 2 months, I'm getting worse. I think I'm in PAWS but not the worst of it because I'm still taking it. I'm wasting away and my BP is seriously high as is my tachycardia. That's why I need to go to the ER.  I have not gone back up to my 4 mg, stayed at 2 but added some more expired valium hoping it would help. It hasn't. Now I'm afraid I'll never be able to cross over to V. I can't do anything but lay in bed. Can't watch TV or listen to music. The worst part -- I'm having to place my seriously special needs 42 year old child (who is mentally a baby) in a group home that is not a good match for her but I can no longer care for her.

I want to taper, but obviously a daily taper will prolong any problems. Irregular tapers are not recommended so I'm curious as to how others have gone about this.

Ideally I try to go 4 days and reduce by half, but because of my weakness of mind and irrational fear of withdrawal symptoms and seizures Ill occasionally (within this 2 month period) have 1/4 a 5mg valium - but then take 2.5mg again either the next day or 4 days later.

I'm also a recovery opiates addict for more than 22 years,I'm 36 now and on methadone 80mg daily.

After some attempt I have convinced my clinic to prescribe me 2mg daily of Xanax and I immediately started abusing my prescription, here in Italy it is easy to get more prescriptions from different doctors and many pharmacies do not even ask for a prescription.

Hi started taking 4/5 mg. Of Xanax and 80mg of methadone every day,the buzz was so good, I nodded all day like if I was on high dose of opiates and I fall in love with that feeling.

The real problem start Ed when I start to inject this things,here in Italy we have liquid oral methadone 5mg/ml that's basically just depurate water and done and we have also oral alprazolam that includes fuckin alcool.

I shoot up 15/20 sometimes even 30 mg of Xanax and 100 150mg af methadone daily,I was a zombie and I remember really little and blurred things of this two years.

This last December I had two big car crashes and I started to think of quitting that kind of life,I had talked with my clinic doctor and I started to taper my high dose of alprazolam,and more important of everything I stop to shoot up it and methadone,just orally for all the time.

When I was almost at 2mg for day I started taking also Paroxetine and I find it really good for me,no more big attack of anxiety and so I dropped my dose of alprazolam to zero.

After 4 days to my last dose of alprazolam I had a big benzo withdrawal seizure,I fall with my nose and face first on the sink than on my back and I have a 2 inches cuts on the back of my head.

I was really really lucky that my little sister was at my home and found me seizuring and shaking like a mofo with blood everywhere and drooling from my mouth,that for 3,4 minutes

My sister called the paramedic that takes me to the ER and here they do a lot of exam on me,electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, blood and urine analysis and finally a CT scan.

They found nothing of abnormal, I'm not I'm not epileptic or anything, they hag the conclusion that I have tapered too much fast and re put me on 2mg daily.

So guys please also if you feel good and feel the needs to stop to take your medication don't be in a hurry!

I tried every method without medicating and its just not  enough. But  \~3-4 weeks ago i had anxiety attacks every day and couldn't  work. So I started on 10mg Diazepam. It helpes motivate me it was like  speed for others i could finally do stuff and work and feel alright.  Then I switched to alprazolam & etizolam every day when I felt  anxiety again (just enough to not feel much side effects but still  relieve anxiety i dont take recreationally it anymore really  (had 2  cold turkey withdrawals after recreational xanax). But I noticed my  tolerance goes up soo high so fast like almost exponantionally. And the  pills dont work for my depression anymore just anxiety. And for sleep  just valium seems to work. It was at a point that i even took opiods +  alcohol (ik u shoudlnt mix but the pills ran out and i took just a  littel especially opiods for my demotivation and anxiety and to be able  to use less pills). Opoids ran out now i take even more etizolam. At  this moment I have 3mg etizolam left (i have no prescription so i hope  that i can get my hands on more today). My tolerance is \~15-20 mg xanax  per day just to feel okay without anxiety. Im also on an antidepressant  lexapro since a long while. I dosed it now to 40mg because i felt it  really wasnt doing much anymore and i build up tolerance but higher than  40mg lexapro i think wouldnt help either. Already was on 2 other  antidepressants lexapro was the best but it just doesnt make me able to  function in daily life all the time. Im doing a warm withdrawal with my  mum with diazepam and she will control the dosage. but im scared that  after it the anxiety comes back and i fuck up my workplace (its  literally the only the best i couldve got because it interests me  programming games) or relapse. My opiod tolerance is also really high so  i often move to heroin im not addicted to it but it could happen i  injected it a few times snorted it and smoked it. I hate the side  effects but it helps me feel okay for a second. but i do it very  irregulary. I just wanted to share my story and maybe y'all have some  advice.

PS: I use all kinds of  drugs recreationally from time to time and smoke weed all day. but benzo  let me smoke more other wise i get panic attacks. I havent really  blacked out since this addiction but before that when i use benzos more  recreationally than self medication i blacked overdosed so often and

Started taking Xanax recreationally for a week about a month and a half ago (around 1-3mg per day), ran out and switched to tramadol and lexotanil. I’ve been taking lexotanil on and off for about a month and a half now, atleast three times a week ranging from 3mg to 9mg. My tolerance increased and it got to a point where i was taking upto 15mg a day, and am an underweight female, realised i was fucking up and stopped using completely around 4 days ago.

At first the only withdrawals I experienced were lethargy and tiredness which I deemed normal. About 2 days ago started having extreme body aches, just constant pain and exhaustion running through my whole body and it felt like I just did an extreme workout except the feeling never went away. The pain increased if i tried to lay down or relax my muscles, eye soreness and throat soreness, flu-like symptoms and sometimes difficulty breathing. Sleeping was a nightmare, almost impossible to go to sleep let alone sleep comfortably despite taking melatonin. As soon as I woke up the physical beating of my heart caused pain and have been having difficulty eating or drinking. A constant headache and the pain is more so in the lower parts of my body at the thighs and legs than the upper parts. Felt my blood pressure going extremely high at some points too. 

I didnt expect the withdrawals to be this bad as I thought I hadnt been taking them for long-term, I've researched a bit on further withdrawal symptoms and seizures are one of them. Am i going to be ok? Is there anything I can do to lessen the pain?",2,0

Going to try it but scared AF.","Long story short, tried tapering myself recently and couldn't do it, not just because of withdrawal effects, but other health issues I'm also trying to manage. I'm currently prescribed 1.5mg alprazolam (three .5 doses/day) and 15mg temazepam for sleep.

Saw a new psychiatrist yesterday and told him I wanted off these godforsaken benzos. For now, he wants me to leave the temazepam alone and just tackle the alprazolam.

He's proposed a taper that will take roughly 3 years just to get rid of the xanax, and (hopefully) keep me functional. No crossover to a longer acting benzo, just staying on the xanax for the whole taper. 

It's complicated, tbh, but I'm going to be basically taking my regular dosing schedule and then at increasingly shorter intervals I'll be cutting .25 from one dose on ONLY that one particular day. Each step is held for roughly 3 weeks. So at that rate, I'll be down .25 approximately every 6 months. He had a good rationale for doing it this way although I've never heard of a taper like this, and he is open to the potential of prescribing some support meds if needed.

Today is day 1 of making a .25 cut to my afternoon dose and as noted, I'm scared AF. Please wish me luck.",12,0

Been off benzos for over a year now since my psychiatrist cut me off my 8 year Xanax perscription (Which I was taking as perscribed and not abusing, I actually asked for a lower dose at one point).

She did this because I was lying to her for 3 months by smoking weed and hiding that from her. When I admitted it, she just cut me off Xanax with no taper. No help. Nothing. After 8 years of taking a perscribed dose of Xanax, not abusing it. She just said I was an addict and cut me off.

So in complete panic of not wanting to have horrible withdrawal and possibly die from seizures, since I did not have enough left to taper properly, I ordered Etizolam online since it was legal to do. I only planned to take it like I was taking my perscription (which, again, I was not abusing at all, I only abused weed) and eventually taper with it. But when I took that first Etizolam pill, it set me off into a manic state. It was so strong for some reason unlike the Xanax, it felt like I was on some stimulant. I couldnt resist taking more, I was taking them like candy, around 10mg per day (when I was only taking 1-2mg of Xanax per day).

I'm just so frustrated at the state of psychiatry. What happened to ""Do no harm?"" How can a doctor that was perscribing me Xanax for 8 years, I never asked for more, I asked to lower the dose in the past, think cutting me off a medication I was dependent on which has potentially fatal withdrawal, is in any way ethical? Just because I was smoking weed for 3 months and didn't tell her?

I did some crazy shit on the Etizolam and ruined my life. I wasn't myself at all. I ended up in the ER trying to get help to taper off it, and finally got a doc to perscribe Xanax again for me to taper. I wish I never took Etizolam but it seemed to make sense at the time when the doctor left me in a position that I could literally have died from Xanax withdrawal.

I have posted before and as I look back it’s pretty clear I have a problem. Long story short I’ve had access to clonazapam for about 3 years. I get a moderate 14 mgs prescribed each month. At first I could take one or two mgs on a prn basis and the 14 mg would last most of a month. In the last year it’s turned into a fucked up situation where I get the pills, take a few mg and lose all control, eating most or all of the 14 mg in a night. The last time I just remember sitting there groggy and thinking “why the eff am I doing this.” 

This was 3 weeks ago and for a couple days I would say I was edgy but have felt 100 percent for about 2.5 weeks since. My life is good, job, house, wife, kid, so I have nothing I need to escape from.

I have an appointment in the next couple weeks and I know my psych will issue me the benzos again without a thought. Part of me knows I should be done with them and part says “well what if you need them”. I realize this is fucked and am writing out this short story as a reminder to myself of this fact.

Also I am a recovering alcoholic of 6 years, however I notice after a benzo binge for a couple days I start thinking about alcohol again, so I’m guessing benzos and booze are somehow related.

Anyway feedback appreciated even just letting me know what I need to hear. With Covid dying down in my state there is every reason to be happy but my mind/conscience is wrestling with this predicament I find myself in.

So I was just 50 days clean but got my script filled and filled double at that yesterday. 2mg Xanax a day. Before those 50 clean days I was getting 1mg Xanax and 1mg clonazepam a month for a few months then before for that 2mg Xanax a day. I abused the fuck out pressies before that and continued to do so with my script and here’s why... for the 3 years I’ve been getting these prescriptions haven’t not once lasted longer than 2 days. 


I’ve had 5 grand mal seizures and the last like 3 my doctors told me I shouldn’t have made it. I like benzos too much though. I literally cannot quit. 


Since I’ve put myself though withdrawals literally 15 probably more times, how’s that’s going to effect my healing process? I have zero attention span and feel stupid.

I ate 30 mg the other week and was so disappointed I stayed up for 24 hours playing Far Cry. 


I really feel there’s no hope for me. During my withdrawals I could get out of bed to take a piss and that was about it. To anxious to answer my moms calls who just wants to say hi and ask if I need anything. Too anxious to get out of bed to make food. Sometimes even turn on the fucking tv. I find happiness in nothing. Sorry for the depression post I just hope no ones taking Xanax like I have so they don’t have to experience these kind of withdrawals. I could write 10,000 pages about my withdrawals symptoms. I feel like going cold turkey so many times from such high doses really hurts my brain. Even when I don’t have a seizure or even 2 back to back. Seizures are so ducking shitty.

I've been taking 40 mg Diazepam for 3 months every night. From then on I've been going down 5 mg every 5 days. This worked okay until I hit 20 mg. 

Now I've been on 15 mg for the past four days and I cannot function. My head is exploding, my chest hurts, I have a very strange and painful dry cough (?) and am nauseous. Also I feel like I am about to lose my mind like absolutely crazy mentally. 

Don't get me wrong, I have been asking two doctors which recommended an even faster taper I did not agree with.

Should I stay on 15 mg or go back up to 20 mg? Also can stimulants (like Ritalin) make the physical withdrawal symptoms worse? 

Thank you in advance and take care of yourself, you're worth it.",1,0
242,2021-05-14 09:47:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nc90bq/my_little_story_of_how_i_stopped_taking/,My little story of how I stopped taking benzodiazepines,"This is my story of how I stopped taking benzodiazepines some months ago. It´s my personnal experience and everybody can have a different vision and approach of the experience of course. So I don´t want to sound too dramatic, but if you are starting this process of stopping benzos I must tell you in advance that this story contains both good and very honnest dark moments I lived and still live during this process.

I´ve been taking ""legal market"" benzos for 2 years. I started with Etizolam has an help to deal with social situations. I took them twice per weak in these difficult moments and it definetly helped me to feel more confident and less nervous. Well, without even noticing it, and although I´ve red everywhere the stories of benzos dangers, I ended up taking daily 0.5mg Clonazolam and 2.5mg Bromazolam, sometimes a little bit more. And at some point I decided to stop this consumption because I realized that I was completey addict of course.

I went to a friend´s place, telling him that I wanted to stop ""medications"". I lasted 30 hours until the 1st seizure happened. Thanks god he was here, because it seems that I stopped breathing for a while...So I just remember the emergency people taking me to the hospital, and some minutes after I had my 2nd seizure...I just woke up the day after in the hospital, and it seems that they gave me some Diazepam but I don´t remember. So they just sent me home. I could barely speak and was shaking all the time. Luckily my friend realized how bad the situation was and organized for me a treatment in an addiction center (luckily I live in Europe).

The people in this addiction center had no idea about the benzos I´ve been taking of course, and they were all confused. I tried to give them the technical details, like half life and things like that, but they were still confused. They finally started to put me on 150 mg Oxazepam a day.

It took 1month just to change from the legal market benzos to this Oxazepam. It was not funny at all, but still I could adapt. Then started the real stuff...

It took me 3 weeks to reduce slowly the medication, having doctors and psychololists around, and full care. I would have never done it alone.

It´s hard to find words to describe the first 2 weeks. Time feels absolutely infinite and you feel like you are losing your mind and your pesonality...you are always walking on a dangerous path between insanity and reallity. At this point you need an ABSOLUTE WILL POWER to keep in mind that you will reach the other side, and YOU WILL. So I tried to keep in mind that this process is the ONLY WAY to go back to life. I had very logical dark thoughts about how to stop the pain, but at this point the doctos gave me an anti-psychotic. Here the main fear is to loose your brain and psychomotor skills. So DON´T GIVE UP and try to start training your brain: reading 1 page of a book, speaking with peoples, walking around (although you are doing small circules in the garden),...

And then after these 2 weeks I had finally 1 night of what seemed to be a ""real night"", so I felt again that part of my thoughts and my feelings were back. That was a huge victory! But of course it is just the beginning of another phase.

Then time started to flow again, but I still had 1 week to go to completely stop the Oxazepam, although I was taking very few. Here is when I had these crazy waves of withdrawals coming back, every 2 days I think, and when I felt a bit ""better""I was still completely lost, having lack of balance, short memories issues, crying alone...

Well, after 1 month I started feeling the real world again, but it is a tough one without benzos. This is when you start realizing what you did with your life when you took benzos: I lost friends, I did crazy things, I said crazy and stupid things to people,...Here is a world of SHAME and REGRETS. And on top of that all your feelings are coming back to you like a Tsunami. It could sound like an interesting experience, but it is not.

2 months after I´m back home. I´m trying to reorganise my life, slowly recontact friends to tell THE TRUTH about my addiction, and still fighting against these weird feelings in my body, my constant anxiety, and trying to practice again my COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOMOTOR SKILLS. Because we should never forget that benzos make holes in the brain. And it is real.

I´m defintely feeling better, I´ve been through the HARDEST THING I´ve done in my life, and I´M PROUD, because now I know I will make it. Of course things go much slower thant I would like to. That´s why I´m taking life very slowly and this is what anybody should do in this process. I really got into puzzles and roller-skating and I feel REAL HAPPINESS for the first time in 2 years :) , and here one should not feel ashamed of beeing in recovery, because this what it is: Learning to live again! And it´s worth it.

Congratulations to those who finished reading. This experience is an insane and brutal confrontation to life and yourself, and you will never be the same after that. But you will be A BETTER PERSON. Aloha!",42,0

First time post, looking for advice on coming down from 30 mg Valium per day.

I've been taking 10 mg pills, 3 times per day, for approximately 4 months now, mainly for crippling anxiety, stress, sleep issues and a recent bereavement.

Here is a short list of non-benzo alternatives which have helped ease anxiety and withdrawal symptoms:

1) ashwagandha
2) magnesium
3) l-theanine
4) omega oils (which include cod liver oil, krill oil, calamari oil and black seed oil)
5) kava
6) kratom

I also exercise daily, have a good support network and eat a clean diet with lots of green leafy vegetables and and protein.

From the list of 6 alternative supplements given above, I'd say kratom has helped the most with psychological symptoms...

However, as kratom is a very addictive substance I'm trying to taper as well (5-10g per day, current dosage)

My questions are:

Ashwagandha vs Kava, 

1) What are your experiences of helping withdrawal symptoms from Valium or BENZOS in general?

2) Which is the better supplement long term?

3) Can / should they be taken concurrently?

4) Or, should I avoid ANY gaba-ergic substances altogether?

According to examine.com they are VERY similar in terms of stress reduction, cortisol reduction, anxiety relief etc.

All experiences and advice welcome.

Tapering too quickly from Clonazepam.,"I suffered a family loss about two months ago and my Dr. And I got me on Clonazepam and I started to feel normal once I was up to 2.25mg a day. Since then I've tried tapering on my own as follows:

April 3 to April 20 - 2.25mg
April 21 to April 26 - 2mg
April 27 to May 5 - 1.75

At this point I was feeling good on my tapering, not having panic attacks or constant anxiety. Also didn't have poor balance or brain fog.

May 6 to today May 13 -  1.5mg

Last night I was suffering from some heart palpitations and this morning I woke up with a HORRIBLE panic attack that's kept me from work. Blood pressure is fairly high and resting heart rate is around 95-100 bpm

I think I may have been tapering too quickly over the last couple of weeks. I'm trying to get a hold of my GP but it's been difficult. 

Has anyone else attempted to taper off clonazepam and ended up going too quickly and had rebound anxiety? Should I go back up to 1.75 mg of Clonazepam or maybe even go up to 2mg for two days until my system is balanced out and I can continue at 1.75mg for a couple more weeks?

I was on Clonazepam 1.5mg back a couple of years ago and was able to taper over time to get off of it, I think I may just be being too impatient.

I'm still mood swinging to varying degrees, but I'm aware of it. My depression and anxiety have never been better and that's what counts. 

Everyone should do some sort of taper. Don't do what I did. I cold turkey jumped. My own personal leap of faith.  Taper. I beg you. 

Quick overview of my prior usage. On and off benzos for the last 13-14 years, maybe a few less. I don't remember the exact time. I do know that kindling is very real. I had rapid Ativan tapered twice before and two CT jumps. I was also coming off opioids all those times. It sucked, but I never would have got on them again, if I had knew their true potential. I've had tons of friends with varying degrees of usage and besides a couple seizures, even then none of us knew the true hell they could unleash. So I get on them again around age 26ish and have a period of ""stability"". I was on them daily this go around for the last 7-8 years.  I started out on 2mgs of Klonopin then moved to 4mgs of Klonopin. During this time a few years later, I start getting a script from a 'friend' each month of 60-90 1mg Klonopin. There for a few years I was taking 4-6mgs every day. I realized I was too benzo'ed out and asked my doctor to cut me down to 2mgs, because I didn't need so much. Around two years before my jump, I'm taking 2-4mgs daily now and in the year before my jump I've got myself down to 2mgs with occasional days of 3mgs. Tolerance withdrawal was going on and I never connected the dots, because I'm brain dead. Anyways, I cold turkey jumped July 16, 2020.

Symptoms:  Tinnitus, Constipation,  Psychosis, Muscle spasms/twitches, I could barely walk for like 2 weeks and even after I was walking with a minor limp for a couple weeks more, the worst headache in the world, Delusions, my back and joints hurt like heck,  Lower back felt like it was on fire to the touch, Chills, Hot Flashes, Insomnia, Anxiety, Depression, Mania, Anhedonia, Skin Tingling, Tooth pain, Tremors, Sensitivity to light/sound/touch, Benzo Belly, Irrabilitiy, Tremors, Blurred Vision, Depersonalization, Derealization, Extreme Suicidal Ideation, Fatigue, Impaired Memory/Concentration, Overall Cognitive Decline. I'm quite positive I felt like I was dying. I still have no idea how I didn't seize out. Perhaps, Gabapentin and Lamictal? Idk.

Edit: I did have seizures it looks like after further research, but they were not Grand Mal seizures. 

  I'm sure I'm missing some symptoms, but you get the drift. Granted somehow most of this stuff only went on for weeks to a month or two, some a bit longer. It hit in varying degrees. My healing was linear in many ways.  The majority of my symptoms were lifted by mid/late September, then October and by November it was smaller lingering 'minor' stuff, minus the cognitive decline/mania. Benzo withdrawal sent me on a 6+ long manic trip. I'd still say only the first 45 days were super bad, but those super bad can not be explained. It's hard to even fathom.  

Mania was the secret weapon during all this. In a lot of ways, I wanted to show the world I'd heal fast for hope's sake.  I'd smile and write how ""good"" I felt, because I knew I could take it, but I know not everyone's me. It was only as I regained my sense of reality that I realized how bad it all was and I knew it was hell, anyways. I just never really focused much on my symptoms. I had one singular thought and desire. Get off the drug and that I would survive. Things would get better.

And it all happened.",38,0

For a little there I forgot why I was doing this. It’s ironic cuz I wanted this more than anything a few weeks ago. Now I just feel so confused about everything.

There is mention of symptoms in this post so if bothers you please don’t feel obligated to read. It’s just a journal entry. 

Not having a great day but writing helps relax me. 

-

Everyday I wake up early. Not because I want to. But because I just naturally wake up too early these days. By these days, I mean ever since I started tapering Klonopin. I’ve been using benzos “sparingly” but at strong doses since 2017. 

This past Saturday morning, I woke up at 1 AM and could not get back to sleep. Normally, I’d read on my phone a bit or if it’s a lost cause I’d get up and play some video games on computer.  Emphasis on the “normally”. 

This isn’t a normal Saturday morning. It’s a Saturday morning in benzodiazepine tolerance withdrawal. 

I can’t play video games without getting really dizzy. It makes my head spin and my hands sweat. Wasn’t a problem in the past but it is now.

Since what I can do is limited I either read a little bit, listen to some music or just lay there restlessly. 

This time I decided I was going to explore some music. I’ve been a fan of Eminem for a while now. Lately I’ve become a bigger fan since learning that he has a long history with benzos & opiates. 

I just put his music on shuffle and laid my head back. I was still in bed, headphones on, to not disturb my wife. She sees me at my worst and is getting worn out. Poor soul. She’s incredibly strong for putting up with this. She gets sad when I can’t sleep, or when I’m shaking because my body knows it’s time for it’s next Klonopin dose. She gets sad but always reminds me that this is temporary. (Sometimes I have to remind her as well).

Eminems’ lightning fast raps on “Gnat” turned into Juice WRLD’s melodic tone on “righteous”. Another artist who I love (rest in peace). I can relate to the words because it’s how I feel sometimes.

Trapped. 

Trapped, scared, hopeless and crying out for help. Feeling like I’ll never escape.  Feeling like I belong in an asylum instead of my bedroom. 

I fell asleep maybe around 3am. Woke up again at 6am. 

My headphones were half off of my head and I went to turn them off to see if I could sleep some more. 

My wife turned and asked if I’d slept alright. 

“No babe, not today”. 

She responds, “I hate when you don’t sleep, I know it makes you feel worse than you already do. Just close your eyes and try again”. 

Deep down I know I’m not going to fall asleep but I half-heartedly try anyway. I was already feeling the effects of my broken sleep. It reached my already stricken appetite. I wasn’t hungry at all. 

My normal these days has consisted of a low appetite, low energy, low mood and heavy depression. Bouts of dizziness and tooth pain (?). Not to mention the over-the-top anxiety & panic. Every little thing is the end if the world it seems (to my mind). 

That day my wife suggested we go to the park. We usually take our 2 poodles so they can get out the house too. Home feels like a depressing place nowadays. I think even our dogs feel it. 

I don’t even feel like getting out of bed, but my wife wants to go to the park. 

“It’ll help you”

I scoff back “whatever you say”. 

These days my attitude has been terrible. I find myself having to rethink my responses because damn have I become rude these days.

We showed up to the park. There was my cousin, waiting for us to show up. He doesn’t know what I’m going through, he’s a teenager and I don’t like to worry him. I’m his football partner. When no one wants to play football with him, I’m always there to play catch. At least I was before tapering Klonopin. 

These days I’ve had to cut back on my physical exertion because of the dizziness. I’m feeling it as I’m typing this post. Along with the ringing in my ears. 

“You look tired”, says my cousin. 

“Yeah I didn’t sleep that much last night”. 

We started throwing the football. 

The weather has been nice in the evenings. I’m in south Texas and the days are starting to get hot & humid. 

Just getting back to that grove... The motions of my old days help me forget about what I’m feeling these days. 

When I drag myself out of bed and go for a walk with my wife & dogs, or play catch with my cousin, I feel like myself again. 

I remember that my “reality” isn’t this benzo withdrawal. I get reminded that there is life. I may feel like death, I may think that it will never end, but those moments remind me that there is light at the end of the tunnel. 

Those glimmers of hope are what keep me going. 

To everyone who made it this far, I urge you to not lose hope. 

I know you’re feeling. I understand the the terror. I understand the feelings of hopelessness and the incredibly frustrating process. I’m right in the middle of it. 

But know that you have the strength to push through. My mind tells me I don’t. Sometimes my body acts like it doesn’t. But I’m telling you it’s there. You have it in you. 

Klonopin’s time is running short in my life. One day I WILL be off of it. I refuse to let it ruin me. Yeah I’m beat down right now, but I know it’ll get better. 

Whatever benzo has a grip on you right now won’t have the same grip in the future. Plant it in your mind that you will beat this. It doesn’t matter what you feel right now. In the future you WILL come back stronger. 

There’s life after benzos. We just have to look for that glimmer of hope.",17,0

There exists some very effective drugs that eliminate benzo addiction.
I don't know all of them but
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil
Seems to be extremely effective.

I can't believe there isn't already a stickified post on this sub about it...

See also this alternative https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/gi82n1/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
And other gaba antagonists.

If your country health system is too mediocre to give it to you then you can easily buy it online. Be very careful about the doses though, and don't apply it while taking a benzo the same day.

Note that this isn't just about accelerating withdrawal, it is about repairing your downregulated GABA receptors. This can prevent more brain damage and eventual following depression/anxiety commorbidity.
In other words, even after a year of being benzo-free it's possible that your brain will never recover Pre benzo levels. Flumazenil give you a higher guarantee of reaching Pre benzo levels.
It appears to repair ~GABA affinity by a factor of ~X3!!

https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168010208000795-gr2.gif

I'd like to add that many people report that they couldn't support the flumazenil infusions and stopped it.
To this I have two main points:

1) it is difficult only if you're still on benzos, if you no  longer take benzo since weeks it should be much more easier.
2) flumazenil centers that give you injections seems to be a bit hardcore. To minimize costs and maybe to sound effective they attempt to cure you in 8 days!
This is dumb. You can take flumazenil at much lower doses than infusions and for a longer period of time, since the regrow of gaba receptors apply more for chronic flumazenil intake it makes even more sense.
So try very low doses and incrementally increase the dose.

This is a success story posted on this sub two years ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/9jigp0/for_anyone_still_on_benzos_or_struggling_to_get/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
And honestly it doesn't have to be hard, if you low dose it yourself it should be easy. No need to be in a hurry contrary to those centers.

Been feeling much better,"I posted on here some days ago detailing an awful nocturnal panic attack I had which I believe was caused by benzo tolerance/withdrawal or something similar. 

I had been taking high doses of Xanax (around 2 mg or more) during the week this nocturnal panic attack and insomnia crisis happened. I also have been using Xanax *almost* daily for at least 7 years (mostly therapeutic doses around 0.5 mg). 

Thankfully, my psychiatrist is very good and is willing to help me. She prescribed me Xanax XR, a version of Xanax which is released slower in our organism. This is everything I needed to start my slow taper. 

Since then, I successfully decreased my Xanax intake from around 2 mg daily to 1 mg daily. I’m finally having normal nights of sleep and feeling no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. Soon I’ll be tapering this drug even more to the point I’ll hopefully get completely rid of it. 

I know we like to thrash talk psychiatrists, but we should recognize it when we meet a good one who is willing to help us. 

I’m focusing on my quality of life like I have never done before in my entire life. I’m being way more concerned about what I eat, at what time of the day I go to sleep, and how often I exercise. Also trying to get rid of excessive sugar in my diet.

Message to everyone on here: keep strong. You WILL get better. Stop reading benzodiazepine horror stories. Just because the withdrawal affected someone very badly, it doesn’t mean it will be terrible the exact same way for you. 

We also should keep working on making our voices heard. These drugs are dangerous and the danger they represent isn’t taken seriously enough by the medical class or the pharmaceutic industry.

304,2021-05-10 14:48:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/n9ct59/best_alternatives_to_benzos/,Best alternatives to benzos,"Hi,

I'm just letting you know a non-widely known fact:
If you take benzos for actual anxiety (GAD, SAD) there exists medication that are as effective and that share none of the side effects:
No tolerance, no addiction, no withdrawal, no sedation, no cognitive impairment, and you can get them over the counter!

According to studies it is as effective as benzos.
I am talking about
### 1) tofisopam

And

### 2) Etifoxine

Tofisopam might be more potent than Etifoxine.
It also is a milf stimulant so begin with low dose (50mg) if you want to avoid any heart palpitations.
Also take it before 5pm if you want to sleep.

Etifoxine would be a second choice, it isn't a stimulant and hence can be taken for sleeping. It's efficacy increase after a month of sustained use but I would recommend tofisopam first.
Also tofisopam has no direct action on GABA while Etifoxine act on GABA-T (benzos on GABA-A) so if you have a benzo addiction, tofisopam might be safer. You can't get addicted on it. 

Beware though Tofisopam potentiate benzos so never take a benzo the same day as a tofisopam. 

You can buy it on Rupharma or many other sites.

full disclaimer:
1) Tofisopam like many other medication are an inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
What this imply is that it will increase the metabolism of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates. 
This topic matter but no doctor will ever tell you about that, and this matter for everything, antidepressants, stimulants or any kind of drug really.
So this means: If you take a drug that is a CYP3A4 substrate, don't take it the same day or find an alternative drug that isn't such a substrate. 
You know what else is a CYP3A4 inhibitor? Grapefruit juice... and it's actually a more potent inhibitor than tofisopam.

2) never ever take it with a benzo

3) to be clear, tofisopam is not a benzo, it is technically chemically a benzo but you don't need to know this detail cause it doesn't share any property with benzos.

4) it is safe and is on the market since the 80s",1,0

All advice is appreciated","For the past roughly 3-4 weeks I have been using alcohol (not heavily) and diazepam nearly everyday, this wasn't even my intention but the disinhibition from diazepam made it too easy(since diazepam potentiates alcohol and I barely even realised what I was doing at the time)

One reason for my recklessness is I believed dependence would only develop after a month or so (plus I have a friend who could go through 100 Xanax presses in less than a month and not get withdrawals).
I'm going to write down my dosages so you can get an idea.

Since diazepam is so subtle and tolerance developed very rapidly you can see how quickly the doses increase (these were spread over the day and weren't taken in one go)

20th April - 60mg 

21th - 60mg 

22th - 100mg 

23th - 180mg 

24th - 240mg 

25th - 290mg 

26th - 110mg 

27th - 160mg 

28th - 180mg 

29th - 80mg 

30th - 120mg 

1st May - 100mg 

2 - 0mg (couldn't get them) 

3 - 140mg 

4 - 140mg 

5 - 0mg (couldn't get them) 

6th May - 30mg Woke up with cold sweats, brainfog and anxiety ( I have previously had light withdrawals from xanax after heavy binging over a very short time period, this was very similar and I knew I would soon get muscle twitches and insomnia if I didn't start tapering)
but managed to get diazepam later in the day
and realised what was happening, so I got hold of some diazepam later in the day, then took a relatively small dose with a beer to make sure I would be able to sleep.

7 - 35mg 

8 - 40mg 

9 - 30mg 

10 - 25mg (I ran out)

Apologies for the wall of text but do any benzo users have any tapering advice for me? This binge happened not very long after my xanax binge so I was kind of using this to self treat the withdrawals.
(The xanax binges were just me taking around 20mg in one day on two occasions because I was blacked out)

I have heard that dependence develops based on time used and not the dosage, so maybe my previous ""withdrawals"" were just rebound effects or I have different body chemistry.",2,0

I was prescribed lorazepam (among others, but this was my preferred benzo) about a year ago and have only really ever taken it as needed. I know that when I take it, there’s a greater possibility that I’ll keep taking it because just one dose is enough for me to want more. I go through phases where I take regularly for periods of time, convince myself I need to stop, and so I do. 

Well, lately, it has become hard to stop. I am taking more regularly than usual, I am taking more than prescribed, because the come down is so intense that I feel absolutely compelled to take the perfect amount that will numb me and put me to sleep for a while so that the suicidal thoughts will go away. 

Anyway, I explained to my doctor that I was really concerned with what was happening to me. Addiction runs in my family, and I can feel myself becoming desperate for the next dose everyday. I told him that I’ll have an episode, pop a benzo to sleep and the next day will be a good day. Mania almost, more productive and happier than usual... until the come down. The come down takes me lower than depression ever could. I absolutely lose all stability, at the blink of an eye I go from being perfectly fine to wanting to end my life. The only relief is a benzo; the never ending cycle. 

So to put an end to this repetitive withdrawal I’ve been enduring, my doctor suggested that I just take it every single day. After explaining my fears, my reasoning for wanting to stop, he insisted that since I have some good moments on benzos then I should just take regularly instead (of as needed or coming off completely), this way I will avoid the withdrawal completely. 

Now, do I plan on following his recommendations? Not really, no. But do I have the strength to withdrawal? I’m not entirely sure but I’m afraid of what’s becoming of me and what will happen if I don’t. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. Any advice or support is appreciated. 

TL;DR: I told my doctor that I was becoming addicted to benzos (that I was originally taking as needed) and that the come downs were causing extreme suicidal ideation (causing me to need to take more regularly because benzos are the only thing to stop the thoughts and control the emotions), and his solution was to just take it every day instead of as needed to avoid the come down. You can’t experience withdrawal symptoms if you never come off.",8,0

I've been thinking about this for a long time. I am more than 3 months holding 2.5mg of V and still get easily burnt out: not too much stimuli leads me to a sensation of overheating in my right temple, I feeling some a part frying inside. It's horrible and once it starts I have to stop working or doing anything. I have to eat and do nothing and wait a lot. Almost everyday I am laying down in my bed during more than one hour suffering.

It's bad, I can't even play chill games like Stardew Valley, even tv shows might lead me to this state. I am barely living and I am holding my V for too much time and it doesn't stabilize.

Two days ago I had this presentation on the end of the day that I kept talking and explaining stuff till the end and felt really bad after it: I am still feeling bad due to it two days later.

This makes me wonder about two things:

* I am tired of not being able to work in a job I like, I am tired of making my parents worried and I am tired of suffering almost every day. I am really considering updosing until I feel fine and leave this taper to my future self in a more conservative way. I could enjoy the youth I still have a bit more then;

* With this burnout episodes I am wondering if they are somewhat related to glutamate storm or excitotoxicity and it makes me wonder if these episodes and this stress might be more nocive than the benzos themselves. So, maybe updosing is not only good for my short term confort but also for the health of my brain in general.

I am considering trying 5mg, 7.5mg or even 10mg. I don't care, I just want to stop this horrible symptoms and make my life much more liveable.

Any success stories adopting this strategy?

One more thing: I take 125mg of sertraline daily.",2,0

I’m currently with my partner who is dependent on benzos and attempting to taper off (he’s had a few relapses). He has a dependency on them and it’s been a journey understanding the specific issues and behavior changes with this drug. I grew up around alcoholics and it’s similar but different if that makes any sense. I’m also learning that addiction is never a moral failing, although it causes harm, ultimately it’s the addicts journey through what usually begins as self medicating and then goes downhill. The addiction becomes centralized and the original issue that caused a need for self medication gets pushed in the shadows. It’s just so frustrating and sad at times. It’s been a rough road but in understanding he just can’t quit cold turkey has opened me up to being more compassionate and supportive, because demanding he quit has only caused him to relapse bc he tries to taper too fast to appease me. So I had to change some things too in the process bc I don’t want him to hurt himself trying to get off them too fast and also want him to get off them successfully and heal. Obviously, my past approach of demanding he get clean this has caused major issues that just snow ball. So I am grateful for this forum bc I’m learning so much and just needed a space to vent. 

Anyways, I opened up to a friend about it because she kind of figured something was going on. He and I both went to her house and she could tell he was under the influence and so the next time I went over she asked me not to bring him. Which is understandable because she seemed somewhat triggered as she herself has had problems with opiates and benzo‘s in the past and is currently on a prescription for Klonopin although she denies abusing it I have a feeling that in the past she has. So when she asked me what was going on and I explained his situation and how he’s committed to tapering off and getting clean. She was reluctantly positive about this news (although it’s a huge step for him to commit to this process fully) and generally was pretty unsupportive of it just because she felt like I was taking on too much of his burdens and generally being mistreated by him. Which of course he has messed up and made mistakes but once I started doing my research and realize that what the benzos do and how they change someone behavior and personality. I am realizing that a lot of the behavior was because of the drugs and  not bc he’s a bad person, he really is amazing when he’s sober. When I realized that I told him I would would you be open to helping him get clean if he committed to it, which he is. Where as before I would just argue with him which is impossible when someone is high off benzos. 

Although I was honest with her about what was going on and expressed to her my own process and what I’ve learned up until now she remained unconvinced, unenthusiastic and unsupportive which I thought was just weird because she understands the withdrawls and is even scared to get off them herself for that reason. She is the only other person I know who understands the nature of this drug from her own experience., etc. I feel good about my choice in supporting someone I love but I could’ve used a friend who understands, but I also understand this reflects more on how she feels about herself. And she can only give so much space to this bc she has her own life. It’s not the first time I’ve been abandoned bc I stuck by a partner who was going through mental illness. This whole thing just sucks. I’m doing my best to stay strong.",12,0

Hello everyone, I have been stopping klonopin 2 months ago. I was taking 1mg for 8 years, tapered over a course of 15 months.

I am still feeling very dark, I feel disconnected and I depressed, cannot find myself in a large group of people.

I have been taking supplements and meditating but that's also not helping much. Also I tried kratom and atarax. 

Would you suggest any med or any sort of ssri or benzo that has no or little withdrawal effects so I can ease this deep darkness and confusion a little, so I can have some relief? I am afraid that my depression can become chronic, as a friend who works in a mental health centre said to me, if it's not treated properly.

I’m not going to set out the Doctor with his answer it was obviously his opinion. He said ( don’t quote me at all I don’t have the text right here ) he said that it is the patients receiving the medications fault for not reading about them. 

In so many words he said in my opinion that Doctors can prescribe them, but not take the time to let patience know that there body will become dependent on them. 

I couldn’t believe his response.

Positive benzo taper.,"I hate to say things or write things out loud, at the risk of jinxing them. However, I’ve quite literally been living in hell for the past 11 months AND believe, since tapering, something has shifted. 

I was damaged by an anti biotic to begin with, the symptoms very similar to a benzo CT but they lasted months. It’s hard to know what damage came next from what drug but I was subsequently put on an SSRI short term followed by Ativan for sleeping. I slipped further and further backwards after I began taking 1mg of Ativan every night and eventually after 5 months I was an exhausted, agoraphobic, anxious, insomniac, depressed, miserable person living in what felt like a dark hungover fog. 

I started tapering Ativan at the start of April this year. I went from 1-0.95 and then to 0.85 and tonight I’ll go down to 0.75. Withdrawal has not been easy. In fact the first drop although it was the smallest, totally rocked me. The most intense being a bout a week. After that, the second drop was much more tolerable. 

Even though I’m still not able to work, can’t socialise much, feel tired a lot, have nausea, tinnitus at night, anxiety etc.  Something in me has shifted and I believe and hope will continue to shift more and more until I’m free of this drug: 

1.  I wake up earlier in the morning and actually feel a sense of happiness about starting my day. I enjoy the sunlight streaming in and by day 10 of my drop no longer have as much morning anxiety 

2. I’m sleeping better than I was in my full dose in tolerance! I fall asleep easier, DREAM and wake up feeling more refreshed 

3. Pieces of my personality are returning after feeling like zombie for months on end 

4. The ability to feel happy over the little things again is slowly coming back. For months on end I just wanted to feel happy over the morning sun or snuggling up to watch a movie and I am feeling a sense of happiness again over these things 

5. I feel HOPE. I have felt hopeless for nearly a year and there is a shift in this. I can see light at the end of the tunnel when before it felt so utterly endless. 

6. I feel stronger. People always went on about how after I went through this I would be stronger and I always had my doubts. Now I can see through the fog a bit more. You start to realise you’re dealing with anxiety and sleeping all on your own. You’re not relying on anything. 

7. Clarity- things look clearer! Even though I still have derealisation a lot it’s a clearer, crisp version. Light seems brighter, things seem more crisp. 

8. The absence of FEAR. Right up until I dropped I had this all encompassing fear all of the time over nothing. The world felt dark and sinister. This is dissipating more and more with each drop.

368,2021-05-06 11:59:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/n6almg/well_be_okay/,We’ll be okay.,"-Short story about my journey so far with Klonopin. 

I was 24, seeking relief from panic attacks. My girlfriend (now wife) has an aunt who suggested I go see a doctor about it because I would feel my heart pounding out of my chest, start sweating profusely, and my eyes would turn red from the elevated blood pressure. Just wanted to make sure I was okay. 

Doctor listens to my heart beat and has me think of a stressful situation. “Yup, your heart rate goes up when you’re stressed - that’s anxiety”. Awesome, I said.

“I’m going to prescribe you 2 medicine that actually WORK, and I’ll see you in 2 months.” Great. 

Paxil 10mg/day and Alprazolam .25mg twice a day. I didn’t know what they were. A quick google search said something about they treat social anxiety which is what I needed. 

Started taking the medicine as instructed by my trusted and reliable doctor./s

“Holy shit”, I thought to myself. The alprazolam knocks my anxiety out of the park for a while. The Paxil makes me feel weird but that alprazolam does the trick. 

Months later, “Doc, the alprazolam doesn’t work as good anymore.” - Up the script to .5mg twice a day. 

I’m actually getting shit done, I’m able to go out and be who I wanted to be. I was able to joke, laugh and be charming. Until the medicine wore off. I remember mentioning to my wife that I felt incredibly depressed once it wore off. I was active on a certain Reddit forum and learned about half-life and how it was short acting. 

Months later “Doc, Alp wears off too quickly and doesn’t work like it should.” - Enter Klonopin into my life but at 2mg twice a day. 

Magic. 1 small tablet and I’m free from anxiety. “I won’t get dependent as long as I don’t dose daily” Very funny as I type this while tapering this medicine from hell. 

My wife was always telling me from the start, “I don’t like those pills. You can’t do much without them, and you get so worried about running out.” I’d shrug it off because they’re prescribed by a smart doctor. Smart is a relative term. 

“Babe I have this under control, don’t worry” I probably said this a thousand times during my using years. 2017-2021.

2021 arrives. My doctor’s office is affected by Covid and will not see patients. Suddenly I have a (60) 2mg tablets and no plan on how to get off safely. Also no way of getting more tablets from my original doctor. So I said fuck it, I’m gonna just stop and white-knuckle it. I never did dose every single day. But I dosed enough to create a severe dependency, apart from my original panic and the time spent under the influence. 

A couple days of CT and I realize that I can’t “white-knuckle” this. I lost my ability to eat without throwing it up, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t stop shaking, I couldn’t see well, I was freaking the fuck out. I was so dizzy that I couldn’t walk straight. I was experiencing intense paranoia and panic. I was losing my grip on reality. 

I remember going to the grocery store on a Sunday afternoon. I felt my heart sink for some reason as I was driving. My hands started to shake and get sweaty. I was getting severely dizzy. Luckily I got to the store to see if my dizziness would settle. I started walking and remember not being able to feel the floor beneath me. I felt like it was moving under me. I had a death grip on the shopping cart because I didn’t want to fall. When we were done I sat in the car and started crying. My wife didn’t understand what was happening. Neither did I. 

We went to take her aunt some stuff and she noticed how much weight I dropped, so fast due to zero appetite and nausea. She said “You need to start taking the medicine again. You’re killing yourself. You aren’t eating anything and your clothes are looking too big on you.” I said I hadn’t been sleeping and she gave me a blanket and told me to give it a try. I kept feeling this shock sensation everytime i was at the point of falling asleep and I’d jerk right back awake. 

“Told you so, I can’t sleep even if I wanted to” I said. 

She sat next to me and said “You can’t let your pride land you in the emergency room. We need you, your wife needs you. Find a doctor to help you”. 

I started balling my eyes out because I felt defeated. I felt like I could make it through but my body was a complete wreck. I no longer had the strength to continue. No sleep, no food and constant torture has a way of sapping your life force. 

I started crying and my wife walked me out to the car and kept telling me “We’re gonna be okay. We’ll get through this. Don’t worry we’ll figure it out”. We went home and I laid down on the couch, shaking up a storm and crying. She gave me a small piece of a tablet and in 30 minutes my entire being calmed down. She said those pills are evil. 

My dad suggested a rehab but I didn’t want to. I couldn’t afford it and I knew they’d probably just cold turkey me off the Klonopin and I would probably be exposed to more insanity. 

I started crying again and my dad gave me a hug and said “You’ll be okay son. We’re gonna figure it out”. 

I reinstated at 1mg the next morning. It took a while but I sort of leveled out. Not very much but within days I was able to somewhat eat better. I was obsessively looking through YouTube, Reddit & Benzo Buddies looking for help. 

I ended up finding a psychiatrist who agreed to prescribe me Klonopin, reluctantly at smaller doses. He doesn’t have a plan but it’s better than nothing. I’m self tapering so there’s that. 

But here I am, just a couple months away from that chain of events. Scared as hell but determined. My wife reminds me nearly everyday “We’ll be okay. One day at a time”. And it brings tears to my eyes. Because my mind is so dark. I’m in the midst of the worst depression I’ve felt in years. I feel fear like never before. I didn’t know what benzo withdrawal was. But I do know. I thought I’d be dead at this point. But I’m still here. Sometimes I can’t take it anymore and feel like giving in. 

But then my wife’s soothing voice gives me a sense of relief. 

We’ll be okay.",61,1

After almost one month of Xanax binge (1 / 1.5 mg daily i've introduced myself again on Carbamazepine,it's been 48 hours since my last Xanax dose, and i do start to feel the increased anxiety , jitters, random headaches , slight panic state , there is nothing scary at all, but its enough to make me a little bit in a ""not wanting to leave the house"" and i prefer just to lay in bed and sleep.  


Most of my WD symptoms are reduced by Carbamazepine, i take 400 mg daily , and it does take the edge off, lets by about 50 - 60 % , so i can confirm personally that benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms are better tolerated with Carbamazepine (CBZ) ,  and CBZ actually accelerate the elmination of benzodiazepines from the body due to   [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes and reduce their effectivness, preventing an actuall relapse.

Treatment with CBZ usually is for 7 days , then slowly decrease CBZ dosage in the next three days, then stop, in my case , im planning to stay on CBZ for at least 4-5 days then stop.  


Keep in mind that CBZ has its own side effects, the nasty ones are drowiness, sleepiness,numb tongue, numb taste,reduced appetite.  


TL DR : Carbamazepine at 400 - 600 mg daily its useful in Benzodiazepine Withdrawal, there are nice reduction on symptoms ,  its also speed up the elimination of benzos from the body due to [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes , shortening the time of recovery, as well preventing an actual relapse.

I hope everyone is doing well with recovery.
I tapered off valium for a year after 8 years of various benzo use prescribed usually.I jumped off at 10 mg several weeks ago. 
Yesterday I relapsed and got what I could get my hands on because I felt like I was having a heart attack. 
My lungs, heart, and entire jaw and face hurt so badly. 
I took the lowest dose xanax I could .25 then I laid down thinking if I could sleep I could think straight about what to do next. I experiences jerks in my arms and legs when I dosed off. I took another .25 to forget the horrors and sleep. Woke up and took .25 mg. Klonopin. Didn’t want any of these drugs, but beggars can’t be choosers. 
My first exposure to benzos was an emergency room ativan injection followed by a script of 120 xanax after leaving psychiatric ward. 8 years ago. 

I would give anything to have not gone to the hospital for “help” that day. I now have all the mental illness and trauma as before plus a lot more. I was suffering from psychosis for the first couple of weeks. Then severe pain and emptiness. The reason I got them was so that I could have the courage to die. 

I don’t think a doctor in my area would help me. I thought if I have enough for several days it will give me time to plan my suicide, and be brave enough to carry it out. Though I’m terrified for the repercussions to my son if I do this. 

And I’m tired for him if I don’t. How do you find a benzo wise doctor? I told my doctors I didn’t want to be a patient anymore after they threw me into withdrawals and I don’t think they’ll let me come back.

Fuck my life, fuck everything. I’m in strong need of support","I 24(F) have been taking therapeutic doses of Xanax (like around 1 mg due to anxiety) daily, or almost daily, since I was around 16-17. Sometimes I would spend 3-4 days without Xanax and wouldn’t feel anything. I never thought I had a dependence problem. Lately, I’m starting to suspect I may be suffering extreme side effects of this medication. 

It all started around 3 days ago when I woke up having the worst panic attack I had in my entire life. Heart racing, pain in the chest, depersonalization. I didn’t end up in the ER but the attack only stopped after I took something like 1.5 mg Xanax. This panic attack was weird because it wasn’t caused by any conscious thought. I had terrible nightmares - mainly nightmares revolving my death. I died multiple times during the same nightmare and woke up in the middle of the panic attack. 

After this nightmare happened, I haven’t been able to sleep properly unless I take 1.5-2mg Xanax before going to bed. When I try to sleep unmedicafed, I wake up very quickly with weird adrenaline surges, tachycardia, shortness of breath. I even considered the possibility that I developed sleep apnea and will talk about it with my doctor today, but it’s weird because I NEVER had anything similar happening to me during my (almost) 25 year old life. 

When I take 2 mg Xanax, I’m able to sleep “without any snoring or any signs of apnea”, according to my partner and according to my mother. So I’m starting to suspect my symptoms could be related to Xanax dependency or my body asking for a higher dosage of Xanax. 

Guys, I’m scared. I have never been so scared in my entire life. It is HORRIBLE to be afraid of falling asleep unless you take a significant dosage of Benzos. I’m afraid of so many things happening to me, I can’t even verbalize everything I’m thinking here. 

Has anyone been in a similar boat? I want my peace back. I want my sleep back. I don’t want to feel like I’m dying every damn time I sleep without Xanax. 

Sorry if I sounded melodramatic, it’s just... this is tough shit. I played with fire by taking this med for so many years and now I’m probably paying the price. I never thought the consequences could be so terrible.",13,0

Initially, I got some for psychedelic comedowns*. Worked great, unfortunately I bought too much 300mg pg solution. 

I’m also currently prescribed Dextroamphetamine for severe ADHD. This is where I realized how much easier it was to sleep if I took a little Etizolam after. Started sort of slowly from there. 

I would take some in relatively high doses 2 days on 5mg in a night then 2-3 days off. Then I would only wait one day and go on a 3 day bender 3-8mg a night rinse/repeat. 

Finally I took five days off then I developed a severe case of COVID. Fevers for 10 days and pneumonia, I’m still recovering. I thought I was dying at one point and decided to take more Etizolam. This resulted in a 8 day bender of around 6-10mg a night, till I felt like I had finally made it past the COVID. I took 27 hours off at that point and felt completely shitty. Anxiety, irritability, eyelid tremors, and wanting to be completely alone, away from my wife and family 

After that I caved and had 10mg (my inhibitions get so low and taking drops in solution with water is so easy). 

I’m not sure if it’s even wise to try to cold turkey anymore. I dropped to 5 mg last night and felt fine (took at all at once and made a bartarded post). I told my wife and she is controlling my doses now. 5, to 3, to 1.5, to .5 and then I’ll jump. So far today I’ve had about 1.5 mg and I feel pretty awful. 

Additionally, I’ve been addicted to Phenibut for the last 2.5 years at a dose of 500mg x 5 times a day. 

I’m so tired of being addicted to things. 
By all outward appearances my life seems good, desirable even. That’s not how the inside feels. 

Anyway, I’m barely deep into this and I feel like garbages. I wish the best for everyone going through these withdrawals. When I was young I was addicted to oxycodone 30mg 5 or 6 times a day. It was the worst experience I’ve ever been through in my life. I can see now that benzo withdrawal can be even worse than that. 

Best of luck everyone. I’m kicking the etizolam

You're investing in your future.

It's going to be worth it in the end.  Don't give up and definitely don't feel like you're wasting your effort trying to get off these drugs.

Yes, it's horrible.  I don't think anyone should go through this, especially those who already suffered from an anxiety disorder.  That's me.  I suffered (still do) from extreme anxiety every single day.  That's what made me fall in love with benzos 4 years ago.  I thought I found an answer to my anxiety because it came from a doctor.
 
When I first started this taper, I was terrified that I would die.  I was terrified that I wouldn't know how to taper.  I was terrified that I would never heal and I would be disabled forever. **The good news is healing does happen.**

I'm only 4 months into my journey.  I was taking high doses of Klonopin at my peak of usage towards the second half of the 4 years that I've been on benzos.  I didn't dose everyday but the 4 years is what hooked my body.  The weekend high doses is what got me.

But you know during these 4 months of tapering, I've learned a lot about myself.  About determination, fear & hopelessness.

One thing that we have to smash into our brains is determination.  I don't know how many mornings, lunch breaks and evenings that I've spent crying my eyes out.  Screaming out in bed, begging God for help.  How many mornings I've woken up shaking and trying to steady my hands so I can drive myself to work.  

It feels like its been an eternity but its been 4-months and I still have a ways to go on my taper.  But I'm determined as fuck to finish.  I just can't rush it because I pay the price heavily.

I've felt hopeless and I've felt sheer panic.  The type where my eyes open really big because I feel the panic attack coming on.  I've felt the hot and cold flashes.  I've felt the excessive sweating and the twitching & involuntary muscle spasms and shaking.

All those things throw me into despair.

But its temporary.  Its my body protesting against me.  its my brain trying to regulate itself while governing my body at the same time.

Its like a major home remodel.  I personally work in construction.  Remodels are not very fun in the beginning.  There's deafening noise from power tools going, there's demolition going on, everyone has their music going, there's guys barking out instructions - it gets chaotic at times and it stays that way for a good section of the project.

But when the final trim is done.  The home looks beautiful.  It gets quiet and everything seems to be where it should.  There isn't chaos anymore.  The customer is happy and you feel content.

That's what's happening in our brains.  A remodel but we happen to live in the very house that is being remodeled.  It will be chaotic, loud and cause restlessness.  But it will finish and we will find contentment in this process.

I hope that every one of you finds that glimmer of hope that we all need.  Plenty of days I've woken up saying ""This is it, I can't take it anymore"".  Then I go about my day realizing that I'm still here even though my brain told me I was going to die.

Find that hope and keep going even though it seems impossible.  This will be over soon.",68,0

1 more question -how horrible would it be to just reduce/eliminate the damn .125 and start strictly tapering my .50? I've been on this dose for about 7 days.

I need some advice. 

I have tapered down from 2mg to 1mg, with a few lapses here and there (which I have posted about here a few days ago and a few months ago). 

I am going to keep it at 1mg for now, even though sometimes I can get away with taking 0.75mg. 

The thing is, I usually take the 1mg (or 0.75) as 2 x 0.5mg (or 1 x 0.5 and 1 x 0.25) within a couple hours of each other, and usually those couple of hours are from the time I wake up, as that is my most anxious time. 

The thing that often happens though is that, even though my anxiety goes away, I get sad and weepy. 

What I am thinking of doing, though, is spreading those doses out more throughout the day. 

For example, let's say I keep it at 1mg for now, I would try to take just 0.25mg upon awakening and see how I do with that. Then, if I feel anxious later on the day, I would take another 0.25mg. Then another later on if needed, etc... Up to 1mg maximum. 

I know this might be just grasping at straws, but I am wondering what you all think of this. Has anyone tried spreading out their doses throughout the day like this?

Any advice, experiences, etc are very much appreciated. Thank you ❤️",2,0

Different doctors have different viewpoints.

For Klonopin, a doctor said to me,  Klonopin is safe up to 8 mg daily (???).

Another one said 3 mg daily ( I was at that time) was too much 

Another one, a general doctor said you shouldn't  take it for more than 2 weeks. 

But the thing is, if you have anxiety or panic attacks, just 2 weeks of it won't help much.

I'd like to read your thoughts on this.",10,0

From what you know or have read, do you think it is safer to rely on alcohol or benzos more? I am very aware of the dangers of both. I get it, benzos are terrible and I know firsthand the withdrawals. I just had a meltdown today and fought with my family and girlfriend and I know I wouldn’t have done that if I would have just taken a benzo pill. My parents don’t understand this situation, prescriptions, etc. They will just say oh you can’t take that just don’t take it because it’s bad. I would love to not rely on anything. I just feel like my life and relationships are better when I take these things. I’m prescribed at 0.5mg of clonazapem twice a day as need and I try not to take  it if I don’t have to. I never want to up the dose, ever, as long as I’m alive. I’ve taken for about 10 years with a few hiatuses. I’ve been trying to quit for a while but I don’t know anymore. I just want to get along with people and be happy. I run a ton and eat healthy. I have an 8 month old son and a history of sort of mental problems and things. 
My question is: what would you think is safer long term, alcohol or benzos. This is more of a philosophical question, I’m not taking it as advice or something to live by. I just find that my life is peaceful when I take benzos as prescribed but I’m scared of the long term. I get good nights rest, am not anxious, I still exercise, I take it as prescribed like 99% of the time. I speak my comic thoughts and eat better when I’m on this stuff. I’m definitely on the other extreme when I’m not taking them though. I don’t know anymore.",0,0

To give more details I was taking 4.5mg daily. I was taking 0.5 mg in the morning as well which was not enough but I didn’t want to take more. Some night my dumbass even took 6mg for bedtime. I mixed alcohol with the benzos once or twice a week and in general my doses were getting out of hand. I was doing this for a month or so. 

I had problems getting my Farmaprams (Mexican Pharma Xanax). At this point I almost had a seizure and got them in the nick of time. This is what led me to decide to taper, I realized that if my pills run out and I can’t get more I’m fucked. My doctor would just put me on “the list” and refuse to help me, I also heard ERs don’t always help you that much. 

I tapered down to only 1mg a night because the idea of running out ok 4.5mg a day was terrifying. The sad part is this is the second time I had to taper and I was able to taper more aggressively last time. This taper was more difficult during the rebound and the insomnia is worse than last time but serves me right for making the same mistake twice. I only started taking them again because I went three days without sleep despite taking sleep aids. I was gonna get fired for showing up to work like that and I NEED this reference it’s like all I have left. 

Now that it’s been two weeks I’m preparing to lower to 0.5mg for two weeks. Things aren’t that bad I am 19 and I heard it’s easier to quit at younger ages. I really want to get this over with so I can have my life back and keep making progress with my career Xanax makes that pretty hard. Also obviously it was a bad idea to go back but I was terrified of a psychotic break with so little sleep. I’m seeing the light at the end of the tunnel sorta it’s just I know I have lots more suffering till I can jump off which will also cause suffering. I will jump off the 0.5mg and bite the bullet like I did dropping from 4mg to 1mg. It’s a higher dose than I would like to jump off of but I am not trusting my doctor he won’t help me he will just make my life harder.

EDIT: my bad I forgot to mention I was taking daily for close to two months but didn’t take the higher doses until month 2. I also smoke weed daily and the idea of quitting two things at once seems dangerous I’m barely able to hold myself together at work as it is.",3,0

I sometimes wonder if this is getting worse as time goes by as well. I am on mirtazapine 30mg but I’m not sure if it’s helping any more. For anyone recovered or this far out have you had similar and does the depression just clear on its own eventually? I feel watery eyed and like I could break down in tears a lot of the time.

I finally quit this year and I haven’t had a single drink not even a beer. Instead I switched my addiction over to Ativan. 

My addiction to ativan has been on and off for years. Usually taking up to 4 or 5 mg of ativan. Yesterday I took 20 mgs throughout the day and I knew how addicted I was when I didn’t even feel anything. I felt nothing at all from all that ativan I took. I can’t even get high from these anymore. Yet I’m still addicted. I spend my entire day at work looking forward to going home smoking my dab pen and taking a whole bunch of ativan. 
Thinking I’m slick I decided to substitute ativan with ambien. So one day ativan one day ambien. Then I found an untouched bottle of ativan and jumped back onto it. Ambien is pretty addictive too so I’m avoiding it as wel. 
What are the steps to quitting?
The dosage I’m currently taking has only been for the past 3 days. But I know how easily I get addicted so I wanted your opinions. 
I have anxiety. Currently I have switched to buspar which helps sometimes but not all the time. Buspar will have me laying down lol. I’ve been taking valerican root with like 2 mg of ativan just to try to help

I've never done this before so truly, this is how I  learn, from hearing your experiences and cautions. I appreciate it more than you know! 

I can't believe it but I'm down 50% of my etizolam dose in only 9 days of tapering! This is a summary of how it's gone so far. All the doses mentioned are in the evening. I've never dosed more than in the evening so I decided to keep my schedule for now. 

Wed: 5mg - normal nightly dose
Thurs: Skipped a night, felt like crap the next day. Very jittery.
Fri: 4mg. Was jittery all day from skipping the night before. Took 1mg under my tongue mid day because I was just terrified of the consequences of skipping. 
Sat: 4mg - felt fine
Sun: 3mg - felt fine
Mon: 3mg - daytime anxiety appeared but it was manageable. Some heart palps, jitters, hot/cold but nothing crazy. I was able to work through it. Actually going to work helped a lot to distract me. 
Tues: 3mg - same symptoms, cut out coffee and that helped a lot with the jitters. 
Wed: 3mg - feeling more normal, still some anxiety and hot/cold flashes. 
Thurs: 3mg - felt mostly fine except that I miss coffee lol
Friday: 2.5mg - felt totally fine
Today is Saturday, I feel really good except for a headache, but I've always had headaches and migraines so it may or may not be related. I plan to do 2.5mg again tonight and see how I'm feeling tomorrow. If I'm good I might drop to 2mg on Sunday night. 

I have my second covid shot scheduled for this coming Friday so I'll probably keep my dose the same until I'm feeling better from that. I felt crappy from the first one so I don't want to dump more symptoms on top of that.

Anyways, I'm just super proud to be down 50%! And I'm really doing ok. I was terrified that my symptoms would be really severe but so far it's not as bad as I expected. So to anyone reading this - YOU CAN DO IT! Listen to your body but don't obsess over every little sensation. And everyone says ""cut caffeine"" but like, seriously, cut the caffeine. It helped me so much. I am craving coffee like no tomorrow but I rather that, then benzo brain. I know things may get harder as my dose gets smaller but today I'm feeling really confident that I can do this!",36,1
