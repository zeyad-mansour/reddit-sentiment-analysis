I have had a lot of things happen in my life, but I have a loving and amazing family & boyfriend & a good job . I am diagnosed with mania / manic depression & have some other things I work on mentally. From ages probably 18-22 I was on it, not heavily but around 1 Xanax bar a day, more as my tolerance built up & never seemed to go back down even now. I never took enough to nod out, or even be so high I couldn’t talk etc. I would waitress 8 hour shifts on it. I was a functioning addict, I lived at home when I wasn’t out partying and my mother who works at a rehab never knew. I ended up telling my dad months later after falling asleep at one of my plugs girlfriends houses and he tracked my phone bc I wasn’t answering. After that In May 2018 I was with someone for almost 2 years in which I didn’t take it. He ended up cheating but we stayed together. About 8 months after that I would take one here and there. Than he dumped me the same day I lost my job of two years & I lost it. I was on Xanax the whole summer of 2020 starting in probably in December of 2019. In September I met an awesome guy and it was causing problems so I quit in October. Within the last month a lot of things have happened and I have found myself taking it again. I feel so much better on it but I know it’s bad. I never take it more than 5 days in a row bc of withdrawal. Just having an internal struggle. Please don’t no hateful / cruel / snarky comments I am doing my best to stay positive due to certain circumstances",6,0

I tried my best to get my doctor to help me go on the ashton method but he wants non of it cause he does not want me to become addicted to another benzo. 

It seems i have to do the old taper way which i am not to happy about cause the ashton method might be better but so be it.

I want to buy a cheap pill cutter to cut off 10% of my pills or something in that range. I have looked on ebay and amazon but would like to know if anyone has a seller on ebay or amazon so i can buy the right pill cutter. Cheap if possible

I drank heavily again over the 2nd year around 10-15 heavy drinking nights only at weddings, bachelor parties, events and birthdays. I’m not a daily drinker just a social/event drinker. Last my go to was usually wine. I rarely drank beer or hard liquor. 

 So fast forward to today. Today is my 2 year mark from when I cold turkeyed. The only lingering symptoms I have are waves of body twitches especially in my calves. I get weird waves of dizziness and random ear ringing still. I also have terrible depression that comes and goes over days/weeks. 

Did I really mess up by binge drinking over the last 2 years? Could I have been out of the woods sooner if I stopped? Did I damage my brain and increase chAnces of cancer/brain disease? Has anyone else binge drank during withdrawals?

I explained to the new doc that I'm still struggling with occasional feelings of doom/despair, SI, irritability, short attention span, and insomnia.

Due to some poor planning on my and my doctor’s part, I scheduled my follow up appointment the day I ran out of my 3-month prescription, and had to wait a couple of days for my doctor to refill my prescription.
In the meantime, my doctor acted shocked that I was taking that much medication that frequently (despite those being his instructions), and urged me to only take it as sparingly needed as possible. 

I’ve since gotten my prescription refilled, but not after a couple days of migraines, nausea, insomnia, and the like. I have existing gastrointestinal issues, and this sudden change has made my existing flare up worse.

That being said, Klonopin has been the only medication I’ve taken out of many thus far that has made me feel any bit normal.  My gastroparesis(and my panic disorder) would frequently combine to give me crippling pain and anxiety, making me unable to work for a month over this past summer. 

All of this really leads me to a dead end; I really don’t know what to do. Should I begin to taper? Should I wait for a month until my next psychiatrist appointment (with one of his colleagues more experienced with controlled substances) and ask them? Should I stay on them until I move in and get settled in college in 9 months? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I would also like to note I am not asking for medical advice, I would just like to see if anyone’s had similar issues and know how they handled it. Thank you!",3,0

It’s been a month (29/09) since i started tapering, quick summary i was on 1,5-2mg etizolam everyday for 1,5 year ( + 5 mg diazepam daily and prescribed). 

While still on diazepam I started by reducing 0,3mg of my daily 1,5mg etizolam dose with a goal of 2 weeks interval, and now on the 29/10 I’m currently down to 0,7mg a day ( 0,2mg mid-day / 0,5mg at night) ! 

I did more than i tought i could I’m pretty satisfied, some days were harder than other, i took diazepam when i felt it was needed.  I’m not done yet but the progress kind of confirmed my motivation.

My goal is to kick etizolam , i will go total benzo free later. 
Anyway it’s not always an horror story for everyone and tapering is a great tool !

I have a prescription for Ativan, and in the past 3 weeks-a month I've taken a dose of 2mg about 7 or 8 times for sleep, so an average of every 2-4 days. My last dose was on the 25th, so 4 days ago. Last night I started feeling a little weird and spacey, and then I started to freak out about withdrawal from Ativan. I eventually calmed down, but last night I barely slept a single wink, I kept trying to sleep but it just felt wrong each time, like I get half asleep and I would have a mini anxiety attack. I finally started to sleep around 7:30 this morning, and had a very restless sleep where I would wake up about every half hour until about 10:30 this morning. I had really long and really vivid dreams during these periods and at one point I woke up with a splitting headache in my left temple. 

I'm currently freaking the fuck out because this basically confirms I'm withdrawing. I thought it was unlikely given the dosage but I guess not. I have a lot of anxiety about sleeping and getting enough sleep, which is why I started taking Ativan more than I was otherwise comfortable with, so obviously this super fucking scary to me. Even on bad nights I can usually count on 4-5 hours of sleep, so this going to sleep at 7:30 in the morning is awful. I'm super terrified of withdrawal and had accidentally let my Ativan usage get ahead of me because I was having a lot of external disturbances at night that were waking me up and keeping me up, and I was so afraid not sleeping that I let myself take the risk. 

Something I hadn't noticed before is that the last time I took Ativan is was because I was still up at 4 am after getting in bed at 10:30, and it had also been 4-5 days since my last dose then, so that very well could've also been withdrawal and I just hadn't realized it at the time since I was so sure that it hadn't been enough to be dependent.

So I have no idea what to do and I desperately need guidance. Not sleeping is right up there on worst fears, and it's so scary that this is happening to me. How long will this last? What do I do? Do I take 1mg or so this evening so it's less abrupt or is that just adding fuel to the fire? I have trazodone but I'm afraid of using it because of the priapism side effect, which scares me. I feel so terrified about this and I feel so trapped. I just want to get some good sleep tonight.",4,0

Managed to cut off 120 mg in two months. I feel thousands of emotions during a day, but already feel that my memory is bit better and can use my brain. I was totally numb for 5 years just to not feel reallity and the world i live in.. Hope one day I will get to zero and life life again as we all deserve it...At least to be grateful that we can be healthy again..

I took my last 28mg of Xanax last nigh to get rid of them, so I could switch to Kratom.

I was prescribed 4 mg of klonopin a day for 7ish years, along with a cocktail of other benzos (lorazepam, Valium and xannax) and some other sleeping meds. All prescribed by my previous psychiatrist.

In the past 5 months I’ve gotten down to 1mg, I’m starting to lose the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s been a really hard couple of months with the withdrawals (I’m tappering), at first I didn’t think I would end up craving but here I am. 

I know how bad they are, even though it was prescribed I know now how much damage it’s done to my mental health and especially my memory. I can’t currently remember almost anything from my day and struggle hard with conversations and remembering words.

In 2 weeks in going into rehab/hospital for the last mg which I am very grateful for. But I’m sitting in bed at 4am next to my sleeping partner thinking about how much I would love to take some more than I’m meant to. Thinking of the euphoria I felt back on my original dose. 

I’m really scared to come off it completely, and terrified I’ll turn to wanting to buy them without prescription. 

Will try attending a meeting soon I think.

EDIT: Yesterday I started the PTSD protocol for TMS alongside the depression protocol, which I started a few weeks ago.

So the Dr. prescribed clonazepam .5 mg, 2 times a day, which was the first thing to actually put me to sleep (even sleeping pills didnt work). This was my first time taking a benzo.

I took the prescribed dose for a full week, then went to half dose for about one more week, then stopped. Two days after I stopped the clonazepam, I didnt sleep for about 4 days, Finally broke down took .5 mg for two nights, then stopped, that was 10 days ago, was fine for a few nights, now last 6 days, about 1-2 hour sleep, panic all night, last night out of sheer desperation I took another .5 mg (it didn't work, I panicked right through it). And feel completely defeated, I have to restart my whole anxiety journey since the clonazepam will take so long to get out of my system

I need some advice if these sleepless nights with my heart pounding could be from the clonazepam. 

Thank you all",2,2

I'm misleading my doctor because of fear of withdrawal.,"Oof. Here we go. Been on Xanax for a decade, originally was my wonder drug (I give public presentations for a living, xanax helped me thrive in my career) but my previous doctor gave it out like candy, I wasn't properly educated and my wonder drug morphed from ""as needed"" (a speech, flying in a plane) to a 6 mg daily habit.

That doctor lost his license(briefly went to jail), enter new doctor. She is encouraging, experienced and agree's we should taper...but not yet. (Because of the stress in my life - I've lost virtually everyone close to me in two years (death from cancer, accidents, old age. I'm not in a a good headspace.) Her plan is for to get therapy, which I am, to learn strong coping and cognitive skills before a taper. Since I'm caregiver to my last family member, she is leaving it up to me when we will begin the taper.  Said many times, ""You are in control of this and will know when the time is right.""

So where is the lying? I already tapered on my own from 6mg to 2mg. She still prescribes 6 mg and I now have a stash of, not sure, roughly 180 pills or so. Reading so many horror stories of people cut off from their doctors and going through a failed cold turkey attempt that left me sobbing on a public sidewalk and people calling the police (still can't believe that happened), I'm now so driven by fear of withdrawals/losing my doctor, that I successfully tapered myself down to 2mg so I could have this ""emergency stash"" in case something happens. (I haven't been able to taper off 2mg, brick wall, don't know why).

This I do know. I can't handle stress of caregiving and tapering at the same time. Call it weak, call it an excuse, but it is where I'm at. My plan is to keep on misleading her (cringe), getting as much of a stash that I can, so if I *do* have to taper on my own, I'll be able to.

I hate it, I hate everything about this. If I tell her what I did, she would likely just start prescribing me 2mg. And my emergency stash would end and new anxiety would be introduced.

Sorry for language but how fucked is all this? I hate being this person. I'm trying, we all are trying, but when is it fucked up behavior and when is it understandable because the system is fucked. I hope that makes sense and just thank you for letting me get this off my chest.",44,0

 Ive been slowly decreasing my dosage on my own but unfortunately received an ultimatum that if im not off of benzos in 35 days ill be living on the street. 

I worked my way down from 2mg to 1.5mg over the course of about 2 months. I just cut to 1.5mg not long ago and tried cutting it to 1.25mg. All was well for two days until I was awoken in the middle of the night tonight by heart palpitations and my heart racing approximately 4 hours of taking 0.5mg so I took 0.25mg to make it go away.

I was a silly man and cold turkey jumped after using 2-6mgs of Klonopin for close to a decade. 

We're around 15 months from my jump in July of 2020 and it's been a horrible last 12 or so months. I was not feeling good mentally at all. I was struggling with holding onto my sanity. I started seeing a therapist this past January.  Great decision considering how crazy I was when I started. She's been able to see all my progress and help track it. She's provided a lot of invaluable info, as my mood swung up and down and left and right until recently.  

Which tells me something and it's something I mistakingly believed too many times before during all this and that's when I was ""healed"". That no matter how you got off or how long you're on these, things will eventually go back to normal. Our journeys may last different amounts of time and have varying degrees of obstacles but we will all get to the same destination one day. It's sad to see so many new faces come and go this last year plus.  To see so many new people join this subreddit in varying degrees of despair. It's been quite the ride, but it's about time where I leave this mess behind me and look to the future.  I wish you all well. Thanks for putting up with my craziness when I was being insane.

So I have been raised in a christian family and been forced to go to church, read the bible and pray until I was 15 years old. I was so brainwashed to that point that I thought that god and that lifestyle was the only thing in life. But one day my brother came into my room and explained to me how he didn’t belive in god anymore and that he had found out because he took mushroom. After that I just stopped beliving and fought with my parents a lot. I felt like I had to restart my whole life. I found myself a comunity that was easy to get into who did a lot of different drugs and it all started with weed and then to amphetamine and mdma. Fast forward 6 months I found out that my brother had taken 7 grams of mushroom and went into a pshycosis and couldn’t take the drivers license until he went to drug testing for 6 months witch he still havent done a year later. He found the drug benzo and absolutely loved it. He still haven’t kicked the addiction and I have found him twice laying on the sofa when noone was home with a plate with a lot of benzo and two vodka bottles. My parents called the ambulance, but everytime before they came I stole pills from him. Yesterday I did a lot of dumb shit. I bought 16 valium pills, I dont remember wich it was. I took them all trough the night. I dont remember so much, but all I know is that I dont want to end up like my brother. I still dont know how to help him.

I have tons of experience with benzos as well as dependence and diclazepam seems to be breaking some of the rules I came to expect.

Anyways, I've taken Ashwagandha with benzos before and it definitely potentiates benzos a considerable amount. However, I am unsure if this is a smart idea during a rapid taper?

Anyone used Ashwagandha for tapers? thanks",1,0

Would like to update my valium tapering..I was six years on the daily dose of 200 mg.. Due to family,
 job and personal issues...It all started with panic attacks and 10 mg of benzos along with antidepressant by my pshy...It's gotten worse so I was taking benzos as canndies.. Just not to feel what is going on around me. Didn't want to admit my self that I suffer from major depression at the best age of my life. I wanted my feelings to be dead..After all those years, I woke up one morming, shaking, full of fear and everything, going to the work my heart wanted to jump out of tge anxiety and fear. 
I look at my colleagues. They talk to eachother, going for coffee and I just wanted to be hidden and safe...

So almost two months ago I told to my self it is enough...

My mind was like how to get of 200 mg daily without other noticing that🙀..especially at the work.

Somehow first month and week I managed to wean off 100 mg, double of daily dosage. Since last week I cut one more pill so I am on 90 mg dosage per day along with 150 mg of Effexor. So far now I can happily say that I wean off 110 mg.. I put on a paper my schedule so take 40 mg in the morning, 40 afternoon and 10 before bed. Already feel weaknes, tremor, anxiety, but have to do it..Once I went throw opiate withdrawl so at least I know how it works and what to expect..
I take 1 mg vitamin C daily, b complex, omega 3, and D and Magnesium before bed too...I dont know if it's helping me but probably make my body somehow to stay healty...Left few boxes of pregabalin just in case when things go really hard.  If anyone had quality and positive advice, please let me know, especially about natural suplemment..I dont know if I should ad L theanine...

Wish me a luck to this journey and love you all...",1,0

I have been taking benzos daily for about five months now. At my peak I was taking 1mg of Klonopin a day and I did that for about one month. Two months ago just about I began tapering and I am now down to 0.125mg of Klonopin. I have been on 0.125mg for about seven days now. I plan on taking one more tomorrow and then that will be it.

My question to you all is this. My benzo WD seems to be different from what most other people report. A lot of people discuss the severe anxiety they have. For me my anxiety has definitely been worse, I am very anxious, but the most severe part of this whole process is this horrendous depression and dissociation I experience everyday, all day, constantly. Not to mention I think about suicide every five minutes now which is something that NEVER used to happen to me. 

I just keep getting this overall feeling of overwhelming doom and gloom. A part of me really believes that I am going to be dead soon and things will never get better. I literally feel like my entire world/life is ending and that I will soon crack and kill myself. I am really hoping the benzos are causing this (I should mention too I have horrible OCD, so that could be contributing.) 

I should mention too I did abuse prescription amphetamines as well and I am almost a month clean from those as well and I feel like hell. I think about abusing them everyday but I literally cannot right now from this withdrawal.

What the hell is going on? I'm just so confused because I wasn't on for that long and never went beyond using 2mg in one day (and that was just a couple of times.)",9,0

105,2021-10-23 17:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/qedw40/withdrawal_stopped_months_ago_but_i_cant_forget/,"Withdrawal stopped months ago, but I can’t forget the feeling","Hi everyone, first time posting here. Not sure what I’m looking for besides people to relate to. 

I began using benzos at 19 (2015) when I was prescribed Ativan and later klonopin following a suicide attempt/diagnosis of major depressive disorder, ADHD and GAD. I didn’t end up abusing them or purchasing benzos after my doctor took me off, but I certainly fell in love with them.

Then, in March 2020, I bought some Xanax to help cope with lockdown and my father having a stroke. Over the course of 2020, I gradually began taking it more and more until by 2021 I was taking 2-3mg a day.

Around that time I started a new WFH job as a copywriter for a media company. While it started off fine, within six months, I was doing so poorly (forgetting tasks constantly, drifting off in conversations and meetings, etc.) that I went on medical leave to deal with my addiction. That was back in June, and after taking my final piece of Xanax back on August 28, I have been completely clean since.

The first month and a half of sobriety was hell, but I can confidently say I no longer have any physiological withdrawal symptoms. With that said, I find life to be terribly boring. Nothing truly excites me anymore, and I deeply miss the “world” that I lived in while on Xanax. Everything was better — listening to music, going for bike rides, sex — it was all permeated by a feeling of wonder and possibility. Almost like I was a child again. 

Most irritating of all to me is that my hobbies are all artistic in nature (making music and visual design), and it feels like I cannot generate the same connection to my work sober compared to when I was high.

I deeply miss using, and I think about it everyday. It has begun to make me question whether sobriety is even worth it. Hoping someone else out there can talk some sense into me .",2,1

109,2021-10-23 12:06:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/qe7ovm/im_finally_back_to_normal_my_success_story/,I’m finally back to normal - my success story,"The last time I took benzos was on the 22nd May 2021 and now on the 23rd October I checked my mind and body over thoroughly and realised that I’m not in withdrawal anymore.

People who have been trapped taking these pills for years might think that someone whose usage was much shorter (total time on benzos was 4 months) will have a much easier ride than them, but as we all know this crap is different for everyone and recovery is non-linear.

My usage is small compared to many here but I hope I can bring a little bit of positivity with this post. I used Xanax heavily (4-6mg per day at the peak) for all of February this year, to cope with a severe trauma. The withdrawals it gave me after just 4 weeks were absolutely otherworldly - beyond anything I’ve ever experienced before. Let’s just say it made heroin seem like a minor cold.

I got hold of some 5mg Valium tablets and tapered myself down as fast as I comfortably could. On the 22nd may I jumped off 0.75mg. 

Honestly most of the horrible stuff happened in the taper and it didn’t get any worse after I jumped. 

However, over the course of this waking nightmare I have experienced the Full English of symptoms. You name it, I had it. Every time one would calm down, another would barge in. Neuropathy, muscle spasms, burning & twitching eyes, burning skin, back and neck pain, jumping at shadows, visual snow, tinnitus, severe depression, depersonalisation, derealisation - just every bad symptom came to visit me and brought its friends.

Now, I have none of these symptoms apart from tinnitus, and my eyes can sometimes get a bit sore (like every few days or so, but it can be fixed with nighttime gel eye drops - the best!).

My mind is clear and calm. I can focus on things to about an 8/10. My memory is at about 6/10 but steadily improving. I am happy, calm and confident again. I can look people in the eye and talk to them without tripping over my words or looking at the floor. I thought I would never come back from this one, that I’d permanently harmed my brain. But my dear, sweet brain has somehow fought through this, and I’ve promised myself I will never put it through anything like this again. I honestly feel lucky to be alive.

Finally, here are some things that helped me during the worst withdrawals. PLEASE NOTE: I am NOT recommending people take other drugs to ease withdrawals, it is purely for reference!

- get off Reddit. Most people are naturally empathetic and reading about someone else’s pain will make you share in that pain. Go on your own journey.

- diet and exercise. This helped more than everything else put together and massively sped up my recovery as soon as I started it. I went full keto with intermittent fasting (no carbs and no food between 7pm-9am. I felt amazing after about a week of this and now I’m a different person. Can’t believe how much of a difference it makes. Exercise was hard obviously, but I used Ring Fit Adventure on Nintendo switch, which allowed me to work out in the safety of my own home, with all sorts of different exercises. I focused on it being a fun colourful game and that kept my mind off how much it hurt!

- supplements. I tried every snake oil pill I could find, stacking them into fistfuls of nootropics. I don’t really think it’s a good idea, and didn’t help nearly enough to be worth it. Lemon balm, lavender essential oil capsules, magnesium glycinate, l-theanine all worked a little bit. The lavender oil in particular was very effective and calming me down at bedtime, it makes you feel all warm and cosy as you get into bed. (Those lavender burps, though…) The biggest helpers were lions mane and omega 3 fish oil. These help repair your brain and they really do work. Every recovering benzo user should be taking them every day.

- other drugs. I tried other substances to help me cope and the only ones that worked were other gabaergics and gabapentinoids. For that reason, they definitely slowed my recovery and once I stopped everything, my brain felt much, much better within a week. But with that said, what took away my withdrawals completely was GHB and GBL. Once again, I am NOT suggesting anyone use them, as they are very addictive. Pregabalin and gabapentin helped too, but I would only take them once a week or so to avoid their gnarly withdrawals. Phenibut helped a bit but I would highly recommend not going there.


Anyway, that’s me. I came here for help when my brain was on fire and I was stuck in a permanent disassociated bad trip from hell, and I thought there was no way out. I got advice and reassurance from kind folk here, and I fought through it. Now I actually feel stronger than I’ve ever been. I mean, if we can survive benzo withdrawal, everything else becomes laughably easy, right?!",34,0

Long story short I have been prescribed the does of 2mg 4 times per day of the Xanax so 8th per day since 2012. I have literally been on that high of a dose now for over ten years and my psychiatrist recently retired. To say I cried was an understatement because my fear and anxiety with the difficulty of finding a new doctor especially living in BFE (Alabama) is a complete and total nightmare to say the least. I have literally spent the last 6 months sending my records to different doctors/psychiatrists asking if they could help me and if they are accepting new patients. My doctor has since retired and it has now officially been an entire month since I have had to go cold turkey without ANY benzos and to say I’m suffering is putting it mildly. I literally haven’t even been able to take my dog out but once a day and it takes me until sometime after midnight to even do that much. I thought I had been in a bad place before mentally but this is the absolute worst that my anxiety and depression has ever been and I’ve been through some horrible things in my life. I was genuinely doing better, mentally, while living in dangerous abusive conditions then I an doing now without any of my medication. I am experiencing horrible withdrawal symptoms and am so uncomfortable every second of the day that if I’m not sobbing and struggling to breathe then I’m in excruciating pain, clenching my jaw and pouring sweat while absolutely crawling out of my skin. I’m unable to sleep more then 2 hours at a time and if I am even able to fall asleep more times then not I wake up out of my sleep in a panic attack where I’m gasping for air soaked in sweat and then immediately start sobbing uncontrollably. This is literally ruining my life or any bits left of it and I am just so afraid of my well being in general because at this point I’ve become completely agoraphobic. I finally got an appointment with a Telehealth doctor in 2 days although I do not yet know how I will pay for it since I haven’t been able to work since this nightmare began. Any medical professionals that I have spoken to while looking to make an appointment have almost all informed me that they are not comfortable prescribing even half of that dose and I’m open to tapering and getting down to a lower dose but I have been on 8mg for 12 years straight now so I genuinely don’t know what to do and am terrified. The way I am feeling is a complete and total living hell and I am not even able to take a shower or eat or take my dog outside so I don’t know how I’m expected to magically be able to function without it after this many years. I also do not have health insurance so I am quite literally so lost please ANYONE who has any experience similar please get in touch with me. I also live alone and do not know anyone nor do I have family so being completely isolated only makes the depression and actual physical symptoms that much worse because I have no one to help take care of me at all. Anyone to talk to even would mean the world as this is insanely hard to even admit that I’m doing so badly. If you’ve read this far I thank you ❤️",3,0

I didn't use daily, and had no trouble managing to go without them in the beginning. Then the pandemic switched me to online school and I became very stressed and started every-other day use. I managed to avoid seizures or any serious withdrawal effects other than serious rebound anxiety, which impacted my academic performance (had to withdraw from one of my 4 classes and got mediocre grades after typically being an A-B student). Not knowing that much about the withdrawals, I assumed I needed to be on a benzo in order to calm myself down enough to excel in school. 
I spent the next summer in high intensity stress about the next school year and almost got my financial aid taken away for withdrawing from too many classes and that I had failed a summer class I forgot I signed up for). Come July and I go to an old dealer back home from school to sell me 10 street xanax bars and immediately worked with the teacher over the summer to complete the failed class with an A, which got me my financial aid back. I made the mistake of associating benzodiazepines as a necessary tool for success in my life as I feel like I'm not a good or responsible person without the aid of some kind of substance. A delusion I developed after years of therapy didn't help as much as I wanted it to. And to be fair, since getting my ADHD treated, I've been a straight A student for the first time in a long time.
Then I found out my abusive ex boyfriend who I have a very complicated history with, who raped me had committed suicide, which affected me deeply. No one understands why I was grieving for him. I suppose I always had that lingering hope that one day he'd become a better person, which I always had for 20 years, but the last little bit of hope was completely extinguished. I still haven't fully coped with my complicated feelings about what he did to me and what eventually became of him. Dead at 24, arrest record, and alienated from every single one of his friends, and a rapist.
I had been purchasing ketamine over the dark web for a while and found a deal for 100 xanax for only 120 dollars, so I bought that since at the Dr appt I went to I was able to get a single script for 1mg klonopin, and I knew I was about to lose my insurance because my dad was laid off from his job. I also managed to get a script for my ADHD (vyvanse) which had been left untreated for years. 
Anywho I expected to go back to my typical every other day use of benzodiazepines so I could succeed at school due to paralyzing social anxiety when talking to teachers-- its been a problem for my entire life. I kept my dose relatively low but didn't notice my usage slowly increasing over 3 months until I ran out of all of my benzos (I was sharing them with my live in bf who has insomnia problems and used a quarter bar every night for a month once to get to sleep so he could be up early for work and at other times sporadically as well-- he doesn't have a dependency on them so when he quit he felt off for a couple of days after his month long usage). I got straight As that quarter so I considered it a success, but didn't realize how much xanax I had been using since I only took a quarter bar at a time (half a bar still puts me to sleep). Due to shipping issues, I went 5 days without xanax in mid-January of this year. I felt on edge, loopy, blurry vision, headaches, joint pain, and the like.
I haven't been without xanax for the rest of the year and forgot about the 5-days of purgatory I was in without them (it wasn't that bad, but I couldn't drive and my vision was affected significantly). And i managed to get 2 additional scripts for klonopin which I hoard for emergency purposes, as I find it has better anxiolytic effects than xanax does and prefer the half life. However, I was hospitalized for 2 weeks following a serious injury which caused rhabdomyelisis and acute kidney failure which caused me to be hospitalized for 10 days. The first 4 days I was in the ICU and they gave me 1mg of ativan a day, which, along with the dilaudid, got me through with minimal sds. Then I was put into their nephrology inpatient section where they put a tube in my neck for dialysis, and 5mg of oxycodone every six hours for pain, but cut off the ativan. I still managed to get sleep and forgot about my xanax self taper I was doing over the summer which I told my bf about. Then when I came home, I had 5 extra days of oxycodone and didn't take any xanax. However, when that was over I did return to taking my usual 1.5mg per day xanax. My boyfriend thought that I was jumping back into xanax use with no plans to get off of it, as the 2 weeks being doped up by the hospital had essentially lessened my anxiety. He immediately tried to take the stash of xanax from me and told me he expected me to only use .5mg a day. Thankfully I talked him into not taking the entire stash, leaving 30 or so bars which I've been speaking pieces of in order to not go into extreme withdrawals from such a large dose reduction. Over the past month or so I've managed to get down to only using 1mg per day and my symptoms are anhedonia, depression, muscle aches, and blurred vision along with feeling stress while driving and fear of doing poorly in school. I managed this by taking more of my ADHD medication which calms me down and allows me to avoid xanax during the middle of the day, as I take it 3x per day. I have tried reasoning with him about the need for a taper and trying to purchase Valium online from the dark web (recently found a vendor that sells in quantities of 100 10mg legit Valium for 375 a month) as I don't believe any doctor would be willing to taper me properly over at least 6 months with either Valium or klonopin. I have difficulty in cutting the xanax quarters into exact halves or less, so I'm at a loss for how to remove 10% of my dose every week-2 weeks. However, I can't run out of my ADHD medication before the end of the quarter so I only use it on school days- 4 days a week, and sometimes less. I managed to go without my midday dose on Friday and today, and I think I've stabilized for the most part, with the help of trazodone, which let's me get at least 5 hrs of rest a night. I have difficulty being motivated to eat, and dislike my boyfriend becoming controlling like this but I am conflict-avoidant so I've tried to avoid confronting him about this. However, this will become unsustainable within the next 2 months as I need 2 pieces a day or I'll have tachycardia, tremors, and be unfit to drive to school, which unfortunately for me switched campuses to the nearest large city and involves driving on the freeway. What should I do? I don't know if the xanax will dissolve in milk to do a liquid taper, but im sure the Valium will. I cant go to the doctors about this without being flagged for being drug seeking and get cut off regardless, so I am stuck doing this alone. I feel isolated from everyone around me as nobody understands how badly I've fucked myself over, largely due to my own carelessness and lack of research. I just knew about the seizure aspect of withdrawals and assumed when I bought my first batch of xanax that if I did it infrequently enough and cut down over a few weeks I'd be fine (and also because I didn't think I was functional before them-- they took away my anger issues and made me more agreeable to be around, even now on the reduced dose I still don't get angry, which was something I hated about myself and caused a lot of problems in the past, and got rid of my negative repeating thought loops and obsessive personality). On one hand I don't want to be a slave to the medication at all anymore because it's not worth it in the long run, but also grappling with my obsessive thoughts and anger about past traumatic events is something I don't want to return to. I want my old self back-- the part that's not chemically dependent or addicted to anything, and can laugh and joke with friends and be social, but I don't want the bad stuff to come back, either. 

TL;DR I became dependent on illegal xanax to cope with a clonazepam CT for about a year now, and I'm not sure the best method to get myself off without medical intervention which I feel would either taper me too quickly or cut me off of prescription medication forever. My bf is not understanding and is intervening and almost cut me off of my entire stash, which would have sent me into severe withdrawal because he doesn't believe I ""get"" withdrawals or understand how serious benzo dependency is. I may not be a worst case scenario in WD, but I'd be risking my mental and physical health either way. I made a 33% jump with minimal physical or mental pain such as psychosis or panic attacks, but I feel dead inside and have muscular pain and mild insomnia. 

Anyways, if you read all that, thank you",1,1

The clonazepam stopped the tremors for a while at .5mg, but then we had to up it to 1mg. I was on 1mg every day for 5 of the 7 months. 

Other daily medications: Adderall for ADHD (my ADHD happens to also cause secondary anxiety and depression), Trihexyphenidyl for Dystonia, 1000mg magnesium daily. 

She prescribed baclofen to take the place of the clonazepam, which is honestly working way better for tremors, but I am facing the clonazepam withdrawal and it is awful. Headaches that hit all of a sudden, nausea, anxiety is through the freakin roof, and I just feel gross. I’ve been on baclofen before and it has its own set of side effects until I’m used to it, but the clonazepam withdrawal is the bigger issue. 

I fear it’ll be like this for a while since I used it daily for months, and I guess I just need encouragement and a reminder that the symptoms are temporary and life doesn’t actually suck, it’s just the withdrawal. The idea of this going on for weeks terrifies me.

I was on Valium 22.5mg for 2 years and have been able to get to 18.8875 mg a day using liquid method but in the process have lost everything am now living with my brother and it took 10 months of daily hell like I didn't know was possible for a human to feel such pain. T

Last week I tried to do a rapid detox program in Tennessee using phenobarbital but my brain has a paradoxical reaction to pheno for some reason and let's just say it went very bad and had to reinstate at the 18.8875. I've never once during this time taken a ""rescue dose"" or upped the dose from the cut. Every once in a while I will end up having a couple beers because my heart palpitations get so bad I feel like I am dying.

 I've reached out before about my Valium taper but at this point I feel so traumatized and exhausted after these last 10 months I literally don't know how to proceed at this point. My psyche is just so fragile right now and with how long it took for me to reduce a marginal dosage without 10/10 pain symptoms things seem really bleak.

My new theory was trying to perhaps address underlying trauma PTSD etc. issues that one psychiatrist suggested is what is making my particular taper so harrowing. 

I also gave in after utter refusal to add any other medication and have been taking Remeron for sleep and appetite (lost over 40 lbs over the last 10 months 5 ft 10 180lbs now at 137lbs.

 I know benzo withdrawal is hell and I have always prided myself on my willpower but I literally feel like I need a break or change in gameplan. 

I held this last cut as I was in full blown psychosis and hallucinations and begging for death because of the second by second pain. 

I got another psychiatrist who says he firmly believes he can help me but that I have to be willing to add medications (gabapentin etc.) and address the PTSD and trauma aspects of myself through therapy FIRST in order to successfully taper off like so ma y others have been able to do.

I couldn’t afford expensive overnight shipping so sometimes I’d wait 1-3 days feeling the worst pain I have ever felt. That was really fucking soul crushing, I still don’t feel the same after it. I constantly crave opiates ever since I took it. Luckily I was able to get on methadone and take it to this very day. It doesn’t really do anything except starve off withdrawals. I still have intense cravings, dreams of using, periods of wd, etc. 

I loved that I was sober but hated being sober. I wanted to feel good, and relax for once. I have a lot of weird nerve disorders that leave every doctor clueless for answers. I was sick of being sick. So I started getting into RC benzos. They were cheap, good, and they made me feel great. Clonazolam at first, but the past month Clonazolam hasn’t made me feel much at the low doses I use so I switched to flubromazolam for cost reasons.

I really tried to pace myself, and even 1 month ago I managed to go about 5 days clean then refilled my soma and started popping those. If you don’t know what those are it’s a barbiturate like drug which (means it could possibly be a taper drug?) kinda helps with my nerves and anxiety but not as well as a heavy dose of flubrom which is .375+ now for me, Normal daily dose is .25. So the soma ran out and I started using the flubrom to help me till the next refill, which is Sunday and at the time of writing it is Friday. 

Does anyone have any tips? I want it to taper and get off this stuff before I become the monster I was about a year ago. And the whole RCs are evil and extremely scary benzo wd stories scare me. I have stayed up all night today and I even tried taking my regular dose but I still can’t sleep. I am just so anxious thinking about my past failed
experience with tapering and all the pain my addiction caused me. And the worst part is, my dose of methadone could be greatly decreased if they find out I’m on benzos. Stupid, I know. But that’s the private health system in America for ya.

I have only had steady access to xanax for about 5 months, and I have been very careful about taking it. I know everyone here has it a lot rougher than me and I don’t mean to minimize that by posting here, I am just seeking advice. 

So for the past 5 or so months I have started taking .75mg of Xanax, being very careful to not take it every day and trying to take it no more than 3x weekly. Some weeks I do good and only take it once, others are worse and I will take it 4 times weekly. But more or less that has been the pattern. I bumped it up to 1mg the past couple months, and this was one of those weeks I felt like I needed it more. So the night before last I took 1.5 mg because I was upset and I wanted to make sure it worked.

I didn’t anticipate any problems, but last night my heart was racing, it was honestly pounding and I could feel every pulse throughout my body, pulses pounding in my head, my arms, and my legs. I gave in and took .75 mg last night.

I’m not sure if I was experiencing withdrawal, but just to be safe I am planning on taking .5mg tonight and then .25 mg tomorrow. I know no one feels comfortable giving that kind of advice but does that seem like an okay idea?

Also, do you guys think it’s dangerous to continue taking it a few times a week? Will that still cause brain damage even if there are times I can go up to a week without it?

I have been taking 0.5mg xanax once a day before bed for a bit over a year now. 6 weeks ago a tried to quit cold turkey, which was a terrible mistake :D I was out of pills as well and had a terrible weekend, next Monday I went back to my original dose and it took 4 weeks to stabilize in terms of sleep schedule and anxiety.

Generally I have health anxiety and panic attacks sometimes. I have a good job, no major health problems, so I really cannot complain, and shouldn't experience any of these.

I really do want to quit, so I went to see 2 different psychiatrists and they both said pretty much the same thing:
They don't think I experienced physical benzo withdrawal because I only take 1 pill a day of a short half life benzo, so if I was addicted i would fell bad in the mornings and terrible towards the evening until I take my pill. So they say it is rather a psychological addiction and the relapse of my anxiety when not taking pills. Kind of makes sense, but I am no doctor.

They recommended:
1. psychotherapy to treat/manage my anxiety
2. Start an SSRI as a bridge while tapering Xanax (Lexapro - escitalioram)
3. Tapering Xanax after SSRI set (approx 2-3 weeks)

I am a bit concerned about starting an SSRI. I am concerned about side effects, mainly sexual ones and also  what if I cant stop xanax and cant stop the SSRI either? Than I would be addicted to 2 pills. This thought really bothers me so today I spoke to one the psychiatrists and told him I'm not too keen on starting an SSRI, couldn't we try something like the Ashton method and switch to Valium. He said that in my case that would be a step back, since I am not taking xanax 3-4 times a day, and Valium has a longer halflife so it could make me more addicted to benzos, plus Valium is more sedating whilst Xanax is more potent in terms of anxiety, and I am more alert during the day.

So we sort of agreed on:
1 psychotherapy - which I started 2 weeks ago
2. Tapering Xanax like 0.375 for 2 weeks, 0.25 for 2 weeks and 0.125 for 2 weeks.
3. Keeping Lexapro in our back pocket for now.

What do you guys think? I would need to be 100% functioning for my job that I love. I'd like to hear real experiences, because the doc mainly told me what these pills are supposed to do, but everyone is different.

Just take them in the morning like a chore.

My psych wants to help get me off of them. But on October 1st I woke up one morning, wondered what it would be like to sleep without earbuds, and my whole brain started perceiving the sound of dogs barking and cars humming (when I'm at my house only) as fight/flight/freeze, now it's delved into bad thoughts and while I've been doing some CBT it's been a long 20 days... I don't know if I'm in yet another wave or what. I've been making some progress and the sounds seem to be returning to more how they were before: bothersome but not something that makes me have a mental breakdown or feel like a prisoner in my own house.

Even if it is just another wave I struggle to see how I could ever get to the mental point to where I could begin my taper. The only thing that has ever worked is exercise by reducing synptoms by 95% when I was really really consistent.

I'm going to my psych tomorrow and just frustrated. I don't want to take any SSRI's -- quit those a long time ago over sexual dysfunctions. I'm on Buspar right now and while it makes me horny a lot it doesn't seem to do much for my mental health. I don't mind taking medicine that doesn't effect my sex drive... home something can be worked out one day.

What's constantly on my mind is the root cause of the issue: why? Why do I struggle with these thigns in the first place? 

It's all so frustrating. I just want to get to a place to where I can feel I can start VERY VERY SLOW TAPER... but when waves of this stuff keep coming it's like it will never happen.

I got back on them after getting off of them (oddly enough when I first got off of them in my early 20s on a rapid taper there were very little problems) when I started having suicidal thoughts over what turned out to be post nasal drip and not throat cancer 😂 dumb decision... wish I could have told myself to just wait and cope through it and find a therapist.

Aka i was on benzos daily for two years. I quit it cold turkey, didn’t think much of it. About a week later I got brain zaps, but i also started taking Kratom and was on 80 mg of Prozac, 40 mg of lexapro, and buspirone (can’t remember the dose). Then two weeks later I had a seizure after consuming a little too much of Kratom (DO NOT TAKE KRATOM - it will give you seizures, and I developed a 4 year habit that I stopped cold turkey in July and the withdrawals were hell and still are hell). Never had a seizure again, never had a panic attack or rebound anxiety. Probably because I was taking Kratom - again I do not recommend that shit is a demon and should be banned. I didn’t really experience withdrawal other than the brain zap and seizure, but the amount of SSRIs I was on could be the cause of my brainzaps as I had increased the dose of lexapro (the reason why I was on lexapro and Prozac at the same time was because I was crossing over from Prozac to lexapro - I don’t know why my psych had me on such a high dose.) No PAWS, nothing. Seizure was ruled as PNES - pseudo seizure as it looked like a grand mal, but my eyes were shut, whereas epileptic seizures with grand mal your eyes are open, i was also not spazzing enough, it didn’t look like your typical grand mal however i lost consciousness. Later, i showed no signs of abnormal EEG activity, nothing in my fMRI. It wasn’t until two years later I started taking benzos again, and that increased to 40 mg of diazepam in a year because my last psych was pumping me with them. Now I’m tapering slowly with a new psych because I didn’t want to be on them anymore - I became physically dependent, not addicted. My true addiction relied in Kratom. Now that im 3.5 months clean from Kratom, I now have to deal with benzo taper on top of that but I chose to taper. I made that decision, it wasn’t forced on me. I’m curious if I’ll have a seizure with a 6 month or longer taper. Currently on 30 mg (started taper in august where I was on 40.) I’ve had one panic attack, but main symptom isn’t anxiety. It’s depression. I presume since I’m being super careful, dragging out this taper over months, a seizure won’t be likely. I honestly don’t know if my seizure was knolopin related - I had the best neurologist in the state tell me it wasn’t. But i disagreed with his judgement and presumed it was knolopin. But it’s interesting i had no panic attacks or paws upon cessation. Just that seizure. I had depression, but I’ve always had depression. I started benzos again because I had some anxiety, and have had it since I was a kid- and thought being back on benzos would help but i never really had another panic attack until three weeks ago when I dropped from 35 to 30, but it wasn’t full blown as I am quite the expert on stopping panic/anxiety. Depression on the other hand is my main issue with this taper thus far as well as insomnia. I presume anxiety will get worse once I taper lower and lower but I completely changed my lifestyle, eating habits, found healthier coping mechanisms. My main concern is just depression and seizures. I really really really don’t want another seizure. Please. Is it possible I can avoid seizures or will it be inevitable? I am planning to taper slowly off by June, and I’ve been on 30 mg on Valium for a month, will be hopefully dropping to 25 in two weeks. I don’t want a seizure. Ugh.",4,0

Crossed over from Klon,  I've been having a hard time the last 3 weeks on Diaz, which started exactly on the 14th day of 0 Klon.

Things are slowly getting better getting to the end of week 3 here, I started taking L-Theanine and 25MG CBD edibles to help with the withdrawls and keep me from updosing when things are getting too uncomfortable.  I have to say for me, L-Theanine is amazing at 200 a dose twice a day it really helps.

My questions are about all the talk revolving around CBD and Diazepam being potentially a problem when taken together because of acting on the same receptors.  I only take Diazepam in the morning (8am) and I take the CBD 8-12 hours apart, (6-9pm).

Has anyone here tapering of Diazepam specifically while taking CBD had obvious BAD effects and interaction?  If so, how much of each were you taking and were you taking them at the same time?  If not how far apart?

Personally for me, I can't think of anything bad the CBD is doing.  I feel more relaxed at night when I take it but it makes me wonder if I shouldn't take it too long, will it cause build-up of Diaz and F my taper up?  Everything seems fine now, I keep seeing these warnings but can't find anyone who actually had a bad experience using CBD where it cause problems with Diazepam.

8am = 3.75mg Diazepam8pm = 25mg CBD Gummy

Also, when I would cut from Klonopin the withdrawal cycle would usually stabilize after around 10-17 days, usually by 2 weeks I'm straight and can feel comfortable cutting again.  After switching to Diazepam, 3 weeks later and while I'm definitely feeling better & that i'm getting close to feeling stable it's taken longer almost heading into the 4th week.  Is this from the initial cross or is it just because diaz has a little bit longer half life?

I've gotten off Xanax twice, Klonopin 3 times now, this is my first time with Diaz and last, I only switched over because this time around Klon WDs were tougher and everyone says getting to Diaz is easier..  Maybe I just need more time.  thoughts are a little scattered here but if you read this and have experience to share I'd appreciate it thanks.    


If anyone cares, non of it has been recreational I've always been prescribed.  I've leaned on it when things in the fan in life, I'm just done doing this once I'm off again I'll use other things to cope and overcome, the benzos just aren't worth it unless it's a dire situation.

Here's the problem. Whether I take the Xanax the same time every day (aka 1 mg at 7am, 1 mg at 7pm) or not (just take it when I think of it), I sometimes get sidelined by sleep. An hour or two later I'm just out.

It doesn't make sense for my body, which is tolerant at 2mg, to suddenly being overdosing at 2mg.

I'm considering breaking it in half so I am taking .5, 4 times a day and it's always in my system. It's all I can come up with. Going a little (okay, batshit) crazy here.

I posted a couple of days ago.

I'm just wondering if anyone that suffered anxiety felt better when they were off?

I have tapered pretty fast from around 20mgs of valium a day. I tried to stop cold Turkey and lasted a day. 😂 so I started at 10mgs of valium and tried to taper from there.

In 10 weeks I've made it down to 1mgs. I stayed at 4mgs for 17days then went to 3mgs for 6 days then 2 for 12 days and now I've been at 1mg for 11 days.

I'm not addicted to benzos, I'm dependent. I didn't like having to be dependent on so much but I've managed to get this low in a short period of time and dealt with the crappy symptoms.

I just don't understand why I should get off when I could suffer withdrawal for years. Not be able to workout? Not be able to listen to music? Be stuck in bed? Not allowed to eat certain foods? Lose my hair? Not be able to work? Not be able to handle the day light? My hair has thinned like I said on another post? Have racing thoughts at bed time and have to take something for sleep? Could possible get akathesia? I really don't understand the point? 

The DP/DR dissociation is annoying. I would like to feel connected to myself as well! 😭

Did anyone feel better when they got off? Especially people with anxiety issues? I have used my time in lockdown to get as low as I have and don't want it to be in vein but I also don't understand why I'm getting off if im going to suffer for a long time?

Did you get off and your anxiety got better? Your life got better and your health got better or has it been a disaster?

Anyways I went a year or two without benzos then junior year (2 years ago) I started taking ativan 0.5 mg daily, that dose kept increasing and I got a new psychiatrist who thought 40 mg of Valium wasn’t gonna hurt and he never tried to taper me off.

Is there a medication that can at least aid in sleep besides my melatonin? I’m not asking for medical advice - rather pure anecdotal stories. Is it possible I can be off by March with little to no withdrawal? She says the ashtons manual is outdated which raises red flags for me as it seems she wants me off my benzos asap.

I hope you're having a really good day or night.

I was wondering if any of you could help me as I'm searching for answers. The last few weeks I've noticed my hair is getting thinner (I'm tappering valium and at 1mg).

I know this is superficial and vein but I love my hair. I've been complimented on it throughout my life. I even had these mean girls cut it off in high school so I have a weird attachment to it as it makes me feel like me... anyway I'm rambling.

Is it even worth my continuing? I really don't see the point. I am currently taking disacioation pretty well and even laughing and joking about it to my close friends (so many find this symptom destressing) and so do I but there is nothing I can do about it right now, so I'm going with it. Even looking in the mirror sometimes I feel a disconnect and it isn't fun.

I've sorted the insomnia out for now. I have dealt with the cramps and spasms and even pushed myself to go for an hour walk 2 days ago.

I don't feel social at all but I make sure to stay in contact with my friends and even have a decent chat over the phone with one of my close friends or family members every second day.

The depression, I keep telling myself it's temporary and laugh at all the things going on. I'm naturally a happy go lucky girl with a good sense of humor. So I'm making fun of my own situation.

On the days I feel better I make sure I do housework etc. I know no one else is going to do it.

The racing thoughts are annoying but luckily I get to go to sleep at night.

Songs are always stuck playing in a loop but I love music and I go with it.

The anxiety in the mornings, I just use to teach myself what is a threat and what isn't.

The brain fog and headaches, I honestly don't mind having a crappy short term memory for now.

I feel like I'm trying to go about this the best way I can. I'm trying to have the best attitude.

But so many people suffer for so long and it really worries me. I'm sorry that this isn't making a lot of sense. I don't bother telling my friends and family the indepth version of this so called journey to getting off this medicine.

Is this worth it? Seriously? Anyone actually improve after they were off? I don't wanna lose myself, my ability to live and my bloody hair for this. I really don't. I actually thought I was doing okay because I've been positive about how to handle the symptoms and push through.

The tinnitus is annoying too but I deal with it. I also write down how I'm feeling as often as I can

If anyone has experience with this or any advice or anything positive to say, please help me because I'm losing faith. 💔😭

Thank you if you got this far.

I want to cut again because I feel stable in all other aspects besides the fact that I wake up every few hours in the night restless and my sleep has been absolute shit. I feel more stressed while I’m sleeping then I do throughout the day. 

My psych said to just do a smaller cut and that the insomnia is most likely not related to the taper but externally caused. I am a full time student, student teaching in an elementary classroom, and doing state board testing to become a teacher on top of tapering, so it could just be that.

I take melatonin, theanine, magnesium, and CBD at night. I fall asleep fine but I wake up restless with hot flashes, nightmares, restlessness, and agitation every few hours the last week or so.
This has not been the case for my entire taper, just recently. I *really* don’t wanna hold again though but I will if that’s what’s best. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what did you do/what helped? Should I make the next cut or wait? 

Thank you, I hope you all are finding some peace and calm today 🤍

I managed to go down to only taking 0.25mg of alprazolam once a day (in the evening, it is the only way I can sleep 4-5h a night so far) and I am planning to keep tampering.

When I lower the dose, I am fine for 48h and then I experience some side effects (maybe?) like clenched jaw, a bit of anxiety, feeling dizzy and nauseous, and it’s all fine again after about 10days.

I am going ti lower the dose to 0.125 and then hopefully stop taking the alprazolam and keep going with escitalopram only!

My DOC is Clonazolam which I consumed about 5mg a day. My initial addiction lasted about 8 months where I ended up going to an intensive outpatient rehab program. From there I was tapered off Librium by 7 days and prescribed Propranolol and Gabapentin in conjunction. The withdrawals after tapering were fucking AWFUL. I never had a seizure though.

Now go back to a month ago. After a year sober, I relapsed. Was just slamming down retarded high doses and not feeling anything. Maybe it was under-dosed? I think my gaba systems are fried and I won’t be able to use a benzo even for its intended purpose. My girlfriend found out I was back on it and I came clean. Shit doesn’t even work for me anymore I don’t want to take it.

I’ve seized twice in 10 days, once at home and once while at work which happened tonight. I’ve been CT the Clonazolam for 9 days though and I thought I was through the worst of it. Then I woke up in an ambulance, being taken to the ER.

Docs didn’t seem too knowledgeable on benzo withdrawal. The lady doctor who took me on both tried to tell me Librium is not a benzo, gabapentin is not an anticonvulsant. Red flags went up. 

So they sent me on my way with 50mg of librium to take for the night and to follow a 4 day taper which has me jumping off at 20mg which seems kinda high. Do I just tough it out and continue CT or should I follow this very rapid taper? I don’t want to have another seizure. I can’t keep missing work due to seizures or just the nightmarish withdrawals themselves. Also, both times I seized, were followed by some hefty bills. So on top of my month-to-month bills, I’m not making money by not working. But I can’t work till I feel better but I can’t feel better without dishing out tons of money, and I can’t keep dishing out that money if I’m not earning anything.

I just feel lost and hopeless. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,0

I was able to lower my dose a lot faster staying just as “comfortable” (pt. 2),"So my last post helped a lot of people apparently and I wanted to expand on the full list of supplements that I used during my Benzo withdrawals, as my first post only included my top 3 recommendations. Note that this is purely anecdotal but based on my own research. Coming from someone who has sadly withdrawn several times… Hopefully this was my last.

If you read my first post, skip the italics. If you did not read the first post, it is italicized below.

*Anecdotal supplement experience that sped my taper process TF up.*

*Recently quit benzos and wanted to share some things I used halfway through my taper which allowed me to lower my dose much faster with minimal discomfort.*

*1. **Emoxypine** a Russian anxiety drug which is simply a modified Vitamin B6 molecule (kinda cheap on amazon) relax comparably to benzos for social anxiety without the amnesia and a great mood boost with some muscle relaxing effects. Also helps my ability to study *almost* like an adderall. Used it while tapering at one point and that was just godsend. Just think of each emoxypine pill as a beautiful GABAergic pill just like your Benzos, or buy the powder (cheaper) to make a great GABAergic liquid solution.*

*2. My second favorite potent nootropic is **Agmatine,** great mood booster and anxiolytic. Acts primarily as an NMDA antagonist (like Ketamine) and also Ca2+ channels which is a primary mechanism of Gabapentin. Also surprisingly good for memory and as neuroprotectic against glitamate toxicity from BZD withdrawals.*

*3. **Lemon Balm,** another great GABAergic supplement that I’d highly recommend is great on its own and synergizes very well with Emoxypine.*

*And lastly, despite finishing with my withdrawals I am going to buy Emoxypine powder, Agmatine powder and Lemon Balm extract to make a strong alcoholic volumetric solution of the three combined, I’ll post on that when my powder arrives in the mail.*

**PART 2** (list of all my supplements and why)

First I wanted to add that Emoxypine or other GABA increasing supplements and Lemon Balm synergize very well, as Emoxypine, etc. will increase the GABA levels in your brain and Lemon Balm will make that increased GABA stick around longer, almost like a GABA reuptake inhibitor.

1. Black Seed Oil (aka Nigella Sativa) which acts on GABA and Opioid receptors and is a great anxiolytic and has Omega fatty acids which help neurogenesis (the making of new neurons/receptors or something) which will help build back your GABA receptors that you lose while addicted to BZDs

2. L-Theanine, it is also a great GABAergic and also for dopamine synthesis and more which are all great for anxiolytic effects.

3. Glycine, low doses (up to 2 grams) are great as Glycine is another major inhibitory neurotransmitter like GABA, and most Glycine receptors are found by GABAA receptors (same ones that benzos touch) it is calming and lowkey takes away my benzo cravings. Higher doses than 2-3 grams can be stimulating though and uncomfortable during w/d as it is also a slight NMDA agonist, but the inhibitory effects are more notable. If you stick to doses of 2 grams or less though you will not feel any of the stimulation from it though.

4. Taurine, although this one doesn’t work for some people and some studies say that it prevents BZD binding so I didn’t use it while tapering, but after my taper when I made the jump, doses of Taurine from 2-10 grams are greatly calming. It activates GABAA and Glycine receptors.

5. Magnesium, particularly Mag Glycinate or Mag Threonate. It is an NMDA antagonist like Agmatine but weaker. However its muscle relaxing effects are great and specially notable while in withdrawal. It can cause diarrhea though so I always take Magnesium with Loperamide (anti-diarrheal) which also allows you to take Magnesium megadoses (I wouldn’t go past 6-9 grams) which are calming for both mind and muscles/body.

6. Melatonin, this is great in doses of 1-5mg for high quality sleep. Helpful for BZD insomnia + high quality sleep will allow your GABA receptors to recover faster as many of these things happen during sleep.

Feel free to DM me for support or BZD related questions, and let’s get a discussion going on in the comments below! Let me know if you have any contradicting opinions or additional tips for others!

But this last 2-3 month run with Xanax, heroin, meth, and even DMT left me ruined on October 4th. I think I OD’d after shooting up meth but I didn’t pass out. I just got extremely sick and dizzy to the point of fainting. I took a couple bars to pass out which worked.

But since that next day, I have been either in a perpetual withdrawal from Xanax or I have done severe damage to my overall system as a result of overdosing plus I have preexisting conditions like asthma and nerve pain. 

I went 48 hours without any benzos but felt as if I was gonna either have a seizure or die. So I took 4mg of kpins which knocked me out right away.

So for the last two weeks I’ve been trying to kick the benzos by randomly going cold turkey or doing a rapid taper. I was down to .5mg but the withdrawal was too extreme even after taking the .5mg.

Now I’m just going to do a slow taper down from 2mg I guess. This withdrawal is truly horrible because no amount of benzos make me feel “normal”. It’s like my body is sick from the drug but still needs it just to not die or permafry my brain. It’s not like heroin where I can feel somewhat normal after a shot.

My benzo WD symptoms are INSANE too. Around 18-24 hours from last dose, I get extreme delirium and a complete disconnection from reality. People don’t seem real. Driving is surreal. But it’s kind of like frying on acid so in a way it’s fun but still painful and jarring

But actually trying to sleep without any benzos terrifies me. The last four times I fell asleep without anything, I had vivid nightmares right away that shook me awake but still trapped me consciously in the nightmare. It was like having a mini seizure in the middle of a dream. Very hard to explain but it’s not fun.

But the good news is I’ve still been exercising and going into the sauna which helps a lot. Also eating healthy food from home. I’d imagine the best way to get off benzos is to do a long taper while exercising and eating healthy. That way you maintain strength as you lessen your dose. 

Dunno man all I can say for sure is that sobriety is a gift. A lot of us stumble into a benzo addiction through a quack or something but I knew how bad drugs are and the potential pain of benzo WDs. I would trade everything to go back to this last relapse on June 12th and go to a meeting instead of picking up dope.

There is healing though. It starts with me going to the gym rn.",11,0

I am the youngest of two older brothers who in terms in money and careers are very successful. But my oldest brother has always talked to me in a very disrespectful way.

I’ve been down this road before so I know how bad it is. But goddamn. That first one is so blissful it’s so hard to quit again. 

I got Diclazepam and for the most part eliminated the Xanax and was on 1 or 2 mg of Diclazepam and about 2 mg of etizolam daily. For last couple weeks. Sometimes it’s only 1 mg Diclazepam and 2 mg etizolam. But right before the vacation my oldest brother had to be a dickhead and I got really anxious and brought Xanax with me. Needless to say my taper went right out the fucking window and i was taking like 6 bars a day while we were there.

Looking for advice.,"It's hard to believe I'm in this place, but I need to humbly accept that I slipped back into using Benzos after successfully tapering off of a Klonopin prescription of 10 years. The taper took about 2 years and I had many WD symptoms but got through it. 

Recently, life has been hard and old habits snuck in. I filled an Ativan script last summer for 10 pills, took them, detoxed, no issue. 

I had COVID this August  and the heart palpitations from that made me very anxious and so... Another ER trip, walked out with a 10 pill 1 mg Ativan script. Took those, seemingly had no issue getting off of them ( i took 10 pills over the course of the month, always breaking them up into .25 or .5 because... I was telling myself i had a handle on it) 🙄

Fast forward to now, i had an emergency eye laser surgery last Friday the 8th. My eye doctor said i needed to take a benzo for it, to which i was subconsciously excited for the excuse. Because the surgery is so invasive, i took 4mg. The next couple of days i took probably 1mg or .5 mg. Going down to .25 the last 3 or 4 days.

Yesterday i felt the first old familiar feelings of WD. I tried to take a nap and my body jolted awake and then my heart raced. Last night i didn't sleep until 6am. Up all night with brain zaps and jerks (hard to differentiate between seizure and jerk) and now idk what to do. Last night I ended up taking .25 and then a half of another .25. 

Should I taper from here? For how long? Or is this just rebound anxiety from the 4mg and I don't really need to taper. I'm scared of rekindling and am so sad that i got to this point again, after my complete success with putting Benzos behind me. Hopefully i didn't totally screw myself over and this withdrawal will not be worse than before. 

Any help/thoughts are appreciated. I'm pretty down right now. Please no fear mongering as my nervous system is shot. I'm very thankful for this community and do believe that we can do this thing together! 💚",6,1

Recently quit benzos and wanted to share some things I used halfway through my taper which allowed me to lower my dose much faster with minimal discomfort.

1. **Emoxypine** a Russian anxiety drug which is simply a modified Vitamin B6 molecule (kinda cheap on amazon) relax comparably to benzos for social anxiety without the amnesia and a great mood boost with some muscle relaxing effects. Also helps my ability to study *almost* like an adderall. Used it while tapering at one point and that was just godsend. Just think of each emoxypine pill as a beautiful GABAergic pill just like your Benzos, or buy the powder (cheaper) to make a great GABAergic liquid solution.

2. My second favorite potent nootropic is **Agmatine,** great mood booster and anxiolytic. Acts primarily as an NMDA antagonist (like Ketamine) and also Ca2+ channels which is a primary mechanism of Gabapentin. Also surprisingly good for memory and as neuroprotectic against glitamate toxicity from BZD withdrawals.

3. **Lemon Balm,** another great GABAergic supplement that I’d highly recommend is great on its own and synergizes very well with Emoxypine. 

And lastly, despite finishing with my withdrawals I am going to buy Emoxypine powder, Agmatine powder and Lemon Balm extract to make a strong alcoholic volumetric solution of the three combined, I’ll post on that when my powder arrives in the mail.

Good luck! Stay safe! And feel free to DM me you got this.",4,0

Anyway, since 29/09 I’ve been reducing my etizolam 1,5mg dose a day( ~1-2 years use) to 1mg a day, i was aiming 1,2mg since i decided to reduce by 0,3mg, but due to the fact that i could, i did it. 
It don’t seems a prowess but it gives motivation that i succeeded reducing more than planned. 
First nights weren’t full of sleep but it’s a small price to pay. Sometimes diazepam helped me at night. 
Since the 14/10 i try to get to 0,7mg a day but it’s a bit harder but it’s worth it.
I don’t think I’m going too fast, my anxiety hasn’t been skyrocketing , im far from seizure thanks to diazepam. 
I hope i will manage to quit etizolam for 2022, i hate theses new years bullshit quotes but it gives me a deadline.
Anyway, if you struggle you’re not alone , and if you get that mental click go for it !

Don't know if I actually fell asleep, sleep was really shit for what I can say. Rebound anxiety is currently the main symptom.  Do you think my symptoms are going to progress from now on? Clonazolam supposedly should have a similar half-life to alprazolam. I'm also taking tianeptine 3x 12.5 mg daily, it seems to help but these are still kinda difficult times. Do you think zolpidem for sleep is justified short-term right now? I have work to do and must have some kind of sleep or I'm fucked. I also have some pregabalin and I intend to take it for some time to alleviate anxiety. Please let me know if you think there's more to come and if I should be worried, taking in consideration that there's few physical symptoms currently, at 48h mark.

I’m in recovering from a crippling Xanax addiction. I almost died and the withdrawals were and are hell on earth. 

Where the fuck is my billboard? Where the fuck is my recovery coin? 

People addicted to benzos have seizures and can die if they are abruptly stopped. Where the fuck are our clinics? 

America only wants to accept two types of addicts: alcoholics and heroin addicts. They don’t want to talk about those of us that almost died from pharmaceuticals because it’d make big pharma look bad. 

Look, I’m happy for everyone that got over their addiction, but it feels lonely as fuck sometimes when the thing you’re addicted to gets swept under the rug and not talked about. 

Did you know Benzo withdrawal is the worst withdrawal on the planet? I’d bet you didn’t. 
People don’t want to take it seriously because it’s not talked about and not reported. Pisses me off. I’ve been to hell and back my dude.

For the Family and Friends who don't understand I offer you this with the hope to shine some light: 
 

Untitled 

The families that will find us terribly ill 
At the hands of a western med 
Yet still seem so blind to the battle behind 
The hell of the loss of the soul  

To help you along in the wake of the strong
Who have fallen but still are alive
I offer a hug and maybe a nudge
It's certainly hard on you too  

Hold on to our hands and make no demands 
We won't ask for much in return 
Urge you to help with a weakened forced yelp 
Ignore us if you think it's best  

We stutter and stammer being hit by this hammer 
Not of Thor nor a god but just man 
We were given this pill and fell tragically ill 
Please try to understand

The sick that takes place that you find a disgrace 
Is something to be overcome 
Remember us when you try to pretend
That it's only just all in our minds  

I beg to differ and words make us quiver 
As can music and colour and breath 
And sleep doesn't come because what we've become 
Is a slave in our own empty life  

I could go on and tell you you're wrong 
But you're not and what would that do 
You have limitations and smooth imitations 
Of a highness that nobody holds",12,0

My first time feeling withdrawal.,"Hi all, I've been really struggling with extreme anxiety ever since stopping Klonopin 7 days ago. I am prescribed .5mg as needed but have unfortunately found other ways to get higher prescriptions recently and have been abusing that for about a month and a half or two months. I wasn't taking it daily and thought there would be limited rebound or withdrawal since I didn't take it daily but clearly I was wrong. Some days I would take 2 mgs at once. Others I would take 2 in the morning and 1 later in the day. Other days I wouldn't take it. On average per week I would say I took it 3-5 days per week for 4 to 6 weeks. 

To add to this, I started taking Lexapro about 3 or 4 months ago which im sure isn't helping the situation.

I stopped taking Klonopin 10 days ago, but last Thursday was extremely anxious so I took .5mgs in the morning and haven't taken it since. Since I've felt the symptoms start about last Tuesday, I've been on the brink of breaking down almost all day at work every day. Its really acute and bad in the mornings when I'm leaving for work. Im a grown ass man breaking down crying and holding it back at work, struggling to focus or get anything done at work. My wife has been supportive and knows I've been taking it, albeit, not exactly how much but knows the situation im in.

Ive done some research but am hoping to gain some insight on personal experience. Im hoping this dies down soon, it sounds like days 7-14 might be the worst for klonopin withdrawal? I just want to know what to expect really. Its been a struggle to say the least for the past week. It feels like its been a month but when I look back at the calendar I can't believe its only been pretty much one week.

Any insight is much appreciated.",4,0

I think I had a false sense of accomplishment around 30 days.  Day 31-42 were pretty hard for me.  Lots of muscle tension, anxiety, headaches and trouble sleeping.  The last 3 days have been progressively better for me, to where now I feel almost back to normal.  For those of you who have been through this, is that normal? It's like wd symptoms came back for approx 11 days.  Came on strong over the course of 24 hours.  Then gradually faded slowly back to normal.  I didn't relapse, I stayed strong.

Now im at day 45 kinda scared of what's to come.  Will the wd symptoms come back again? Idk.  All I know is I'm just ready for this to be in my rear view mirror ✌🏻

(1 year clean today),"TL;DR: My psych abruptly took me off benzos without telling me the side effects. Spent the next few months convinced I had MS or another nervous system disorder. 

After being prescribed 0.5mg of Clonzapam for about 15months, my doctor abruptly took me off of them. He didn't tell me what to expect so I assumed I would feel like shit for a week or two and then would be back in business. Around 30days after stopping, I started having really bad vision problems, migraines and \*horrific\* anxiety. My symptoms would come in waves--one day my hands would be tingling, I'd have a throbbing headache and anxiety. Another day, I'd have bad double vision, coordination problems and my blood pressure would be off the charts. 

&#x200B;

I started googling symptoms and convinced myself I had something wrong with my nervous system. At the time, I didn't have a regular doctor so I got an appointment at my local clinic with a nurse practitioner. She had no interest in diagnosing anything and was only interested in treating my blood pressure and thought everything else was just a side effect. I told her that I stopped taking benzos 3 months ago and she brushed it off and prescribed me blood pressure medicine (i'm a healthy 27yo male that weighs 155 with no history of high blood pressure)

&#x200B;

When I came back (T-4 months clean) and my blood pressure was under control but I was still having significant side effects, she still was convinced it was just anxiety and wanted to prescribe me anti-depressants.  That day, she had a medical student shadowing her that basically forced her to take this seriously and order a CT scan to test me for MS. The scan came back normal so, on my follow appointment (T-5 months clean), she gave me the number of a Neurologist. Frustrated by this whole ordeal and convinced something was seriously wrong, I got an appointment with a real Doctor. After meeting him for the first time and going over my symptoms, he stopped and looked at me and asked ""have you recently stopped taking benzos?"" I told him that my psych took me off them abruptly 5 months ago and he looked at me with a combination of confusion and sympathy. He sat next to me and asked me to explain my dosage and how I tapered off of them. When I told him I didn't taper, the psych just abruptly stopped them, I could see him get visibly angry and said ""that guy shouldn't be practicing medicine. he could have killed you"". I left the doctors office feeling a combination of relief that I wasn't dying, and embarrassment that I didn't know what was wrong with me. 

&#x200B;

Since that day, I have had the worst/best year of my life. My symptoms still persist but I have more good days than bad days. Knowing that these feelings are a side effect of WD's and not a life long nervous system disorder brings me a lot of comfort. For the first time in years, I feel genuinely happy most days. I have gotten better at learning what triggers the bad days and have done my best to remain vigilant. Lack of sleep is a guaranteed bad day, taking melatonin makes it even worse. It is terrifying how insidious benzos are. At 9months in I had a week where it felt like I was in full blown acute WDs again, and had to remind myself that I wasn't actually sick. 

&#x200B;

If anyone is considering quitting, I think it will be the best decision you've ever made. Even if you're scared of the WD's that lie ahead just remember--you probably \*already\* feel like shit, at least in recovery you know that you feel like shit because you're getting better. The time eventually starts to go by quickly and you'll wake up one day and realize its been 6 months, 1 year, 5 years since stopping. The feeling of being 1 year clean bring me an overwhelming sense of peace and pride.",28,0

My trouble is that I am going on a holiday in 3 weeks and I would like to avoid travelling with illegally sourced diazepam.

* Last week I dropped my dosage to 7mg/day
* This week I'm aiming to take 5mg/day
* Next week - 3mg/day
* Final week - 1.8mg/day

**Does it look like a sensible plan?**

My withdrawals are manageable so far: insomnia, restlessness, body pain and headache. When should I expect the worst symptoms?

*I'm also addicted to kratom and I have 3 weeks left to taper from 8g/day to 0.*

Thank you for your experienced advice.

I've changed my mind: I'm going to hover at 7mg/day for a few weeks and slow down my taper. I will take some diazepam with me.",2,0

How does this effect tapering? (Serious question)","About a year ago if not longer I started eating etizolam like candy, didn’t help it tasted good too. But I got caught back up on benzo addiction which I’ve beaten before, but never on my own. Always had to go to rehab.

I work for myself and decided to not go to rehab and try to muscle through. The hardest benzo I had was flualp and I only did it on occasion. Stuck with Xanax and etizolam. 

About two months ago I decided enough. I was aimlessly popping them and started to write down how much I took. I was about 4 mg Xanax and 5 mg etizolam pretty regularly. I got Diclazepam and started taking that in the morning instead of Xanax. 

Fast forward to today, I have only taken one mg of Diclazepam and feel fine. So I believe my tolerance has successfully dropped and I have been sticking to about 2 mg Diclazepam and 1-2 mg etizolam. I keep cutting down on my daily intake but random days I’ll want to get fucked up and the power to not do it is so strong. So I’ll eat maybe 10-15 mg Xanax (I’m guessing and this is a combo of etizolam and Xanax, I’m guessing the equivalent would be about this amount) 

How does randomly getting fucked up while tapering effect your taper? I know it sounds dumb but some days are just so fucking hard! I have taken steps to eliminate them. I gave a majority of my stuff to someone I trust who will give me some when I’m running low if I need it. The plan is to throw them away once I’m free from daily using.

I posted recently about my intention to switch to diazepam from alprazolam (street bars though so who knows what was actually in them).

I used an online conversion calculator and asked for recommended doses here, based on the assumption I was taking approximately 1mg alprazolam. I started at 10mg diazepam and then in the same evening had to take another 10mg and then another, so 30mg total and still had a really rough night (barely got to sleep and spent the whole night in limbo, half awake, half asleep). Felt like crap in the morning.

What worked for me was to take a small amount of my street bars (like less than a quarter) in the morning which got me through the day, then 20mg diazepam. I did this for a few days, taking a smaller amount of alprazolam each morning until it was barely a sliver.

I'm now feeling really comfortable on just diazepam and have begun tapering off that, so today I've taken 17.5mg. I'll step down by 2.5mg every few days (unless I feel unconformable, in which case I will slow down).

This is the best I've felt in several years. I was really anxious about switching but, once my body adjusted, the diazepam started working and doing what I needed it to do but without the daily withdrawal I was getting from tapering from alprazolam.

Everyone's experience is different but the end is in sight for me now and I feel so much more optimistic than I did a week ago.

I hope this information is useful to somebody. Listen to your doctor and take their advice over what I've shared here. I just want people to know that diazepam can fill the hole if you give it time and it makes the tapering so much less stressful.

Good luck, everyone, take your own path and start focused on day-by-day progress.

Thanks to everyone for the support so far. I'll post another update when I've been clean for a week or so, so hopefully in the next few weeks. Love to everyone.",3,0

I found the ashton manual here. My doctors documented their first ever long taper, so now they have a reference for other patients.
I did Clonazepam to diazepam down from 3mg at highest, but I was taking them for 7 years. I didn’t know they were like this. 
The taper was pretty rough. I went really slow and had to pause / hold several times for other health issues. I stopped when any life issues needed more stability, too. 
I had to go back up to the last level a couple of times when I got this feeling: my whole body would stiffen up, and then I would jolt. In the beginning, when I tried to quit in 2 weeks, that led to a seizure, so the stiffening meant - back off. 

I do have PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome). My stomach isn’t fond of complicated food or a lot of it. I just eat bland and slow. I get some twitches. 
While I was tapering, I had trouble questioning: “is this what I’m really thinking or is this benzos?” 
Benzo withdrawal has those waves of - paranoia? 
CBT has those amazing “thought records” - that guide you through “is it me or the Benzos.” I’m doing some DBT and ACT, too. (Endless therapy - because my brain feels like it’s mine, again - and its rough remembering how weird I acted tapering off these things.) 
I’m eating really healthy (what I do eat - plant stuff - a lot of soup) 

I tried meditation before this - (but also made the jokes - “but have you tried meditation for your crippling withdrawals?” Lol)

I can’t believe I’m going to write this… I get these flashes of anxiety, and I really slammed this whole mindfulness thing into my head - and it works - but only after I learned it with some people focused on people with c PTSD.  In this case, mindfulness, is actually knocking on objects in your room, or smelling something. 5 things. Your mind can’t go off into rumination land. 
(I picture an evil Clonazepam pill trying to lure me back to it) 

This feels like - holding onto reality. It’s been great for anxiety. My brain can’t get anxious if I’ve assigned it to a foot soak, learning a new language, and eating blueberries at the same time. 

In the last 2 1/2 months, I’m playing music more. I started sketching again. The fog is lifting. I’m waking up and getting right out of bed. My sleep is more regular. My mood is more even.

I’m really happy I did the slowest taper imaginable- but during it - I felt like a prisoner in my body 

I’m mostly indoors still - but I’m so happy about this taper being over, I can wait  to go to a concert or anywhere - for several more months…

I am 5 weeks in after cold turkeying a very high dose clonazoLAM addiction (2+ mg daily).  The first 3 weeks consisted of very severe muscle pain / burning, confusion, and agoraphobia.  Now at 5 weeks, the muscle pain has subsided for the most part, but I still get what I can only describe as a painful burning sensation that is actually centered inside my head.  It feels as if my brain is being simultaneously burned and slightly shocked at the same time.  My eyes and sinuses have the same sensation.

It is like this most of the time and it is very unpleasant, and it is also accompanied by the most severe social anxiety / agoraphobia I have ever experienced.  Pretty much to where I cannot have a normal convo with co-workers or family.  Im also suffering from extreme insomnia every night, which I have been treating with 1800mgs gabapentin, and occasionally I'll use f-phenibut instead just so that I don't run out of the gabapentin before my refill, because I don't know how long this will last. 

My question is, am I prolonging my withdrawal by using the gabapentin and f-phenibut at night?  Also has anyone else experienced this strange head symptom that I described? I ask because I haven't seen it really described anywhere else. 

Also, should I just continue to ride this out since I'm 5 weeks in, or try to find a doctor that will get me back on benzos to do a proper taper, and if so what type of doctor is best for this (family medicine, psych, etc).

But I just can't seem to find any place that will sort of customize a stay with them. My idea is something like, 2-3 months, do the first month to get stabilized, then return to an area where you can focus on cutting steadily, and come back when you're ready to/have taken your last dose and come back and be available to dig into the shame and guilt and other matters. Because right now, with the 30 day stay, 7 day detox, I feel like i'd just be paralyzed by the withdrawal and post withdrawal effects to do anything therapeutic the entire 30 days, making it a rather big waste of money.

I was taking 4-8mg of Xanax off and on for 3 months. But had a 2 week solid run of them which I think finally put me over the edge physically dependent wise.

Now I’m on 4mg of klonopin that was prescribed by an ER doctor. I got down to 2mg of klonopin just taken before sleep but was in withdrawal for much of the day so by the time I took the 2mg I was in a ton of pain.

Now I’m not sure if I should be taking 1mg when I wake up of klonopin then 1mg before I try to sleep? So that way I’m not in so much pain during the day.

What does a legit tapering schedule look like? Part of me wants to just quit cold turkey and endure the pain until it’s absolutely necessary to take like 1mg to knock me out after 24-48 hours of no sleep and extreme pain.

Simply put: I wanna get off benzos ASAP, have a high tolerance for withdrawal pain, and don’t wanna do a weeks or months long taper.

Any suggestions? This is way different than opiate withdrawal so I’m kinda lost. It seems like everyone has a different reaction to benzo withdrawal. Mine is high anxiety combined with burning and tingling and massive dizziness and wooziness plus extreme fatigue and insomnia.

Fast forward, I decided to take xanax again after 4 months before a big trip. After that I couldn't again sleep for 4-5 days, now things are getting better again.

I hope you are all going well on your journeys!

Thank you for helping me when I was an irrational, chaotic mess and soooo anxious!

I was reading so many stories and it seemed like whether you taper or you CT you still suffer for years and years and years.

I felt so discouraged reading these posts! And thought I'm in lockdown now so why not just jump off the ledge and see what happens but with your help and advice, I tapered.

I have been prescribed all different benzos (Xanax, Valium, oxazapam, nitrazapam) since I was 20 (a decade) but was able to easily stop and start in my early 20s without noticing anything but to be fair I didn't know there was withdrawal.

This time I've been on benzos for 6 years. 

I don't know how to go about this last 2mgs of Valium? I've been on 2mgs for 10 days.

How did you guys do your last bit? Is there any success stories? Do you know what I should be prepared for? I guess it's all individual...

How worried should I be? 

Is anyone improving? Does it get worse when you stop or stay the same for a while?

I'm dealing with muscle spasms, tinnitus, inner vibrations and trembling, aching muscles, anxiety, depression and a saw jaw lol! I sleep but it's broken and I need sleep aids. Oh and brain fog but it comes and goes :)

 I've been told (and backed up more or less thru research) that the amount of clonazolam I take on a bad day alone is equivalent to almost 3mg of xanax. And this isn't even counting the other drug.

Do you think a doctor, knowing full well that I was never prescribed either substance, and only having dubious sources of info on them will be able to prescribe me a benzo that's easier to taper? 

I'd like to go the valium route coupled with anti seizure meds and a few supplements this seems to be the accepted method.

It’s been brutal. 3 hours of sleep once I wake up I can’t fall asleep and I have no motivation to do anything and have brutal depression on top of that. Certain smells will make me gag. I laid on the bathroom floor with a blanket listening to YouTube videos for 5 days straight. It was painful mentally and physically. 

However I am also addicted to Clonzolam I take 6 .25 drops of it in the morning and 13 .25 drops at night before bed. That’s 1.5mg in the morning and 3.25mg at night. 


My parents found out about my addiction and called me and wanted me to go to rehab. My mom was crying it was the worse feeling of my life. On top of that I was going through the Kratom withdrawal so I was already super deppresed they pretty much gave me an intervention. I quit my job to kick the stuff so I’m low about that too. My girlfriend works but it makes me feel like shit that I can’t work right now. 

I wake up everyday wanting to scream because I know coming off of benzos is going to be hard I think I take equal to 13.25 mgs of Xanax a day by comparison since clonzolam is 2.5x stronger then Aprazolam (Xanax). 

I normally do construction but I have major insomnia and I know that taper from benzos is going to make it impossible to sleep and I won’t be able to go back to my bread and butter till I’m clean.

I decided to start tapering today. I took 5 drops today instead of 6 I’m going to take a drop off every few days and work on getting rid of my morning dose first. Then taper my night dose. 

I’m going to try to find an easy job like Lyft or something part time till I get clean there’s no way I can go back to construction like this and there’s a lot of drug users in construction I’d say 90 percent. 

Should I taper at home I have like 3 or 4 bottles of clam and 1 bottle of diclzapam or whatever you call it and a 2ml not of flobrzolam. Im going to switch to the diclzapam at the very end. 


Im worried about going to rehab. Im worried they will give me barely enough benzos and I’ll be trapped there in agonizing withdrawal having seizures. I bet a doctor wouldn’t be much help either I heard they get a speedy taper and still have seizures from the doctors taper. I’ve been chronically depressed since realizing I’m trapped on benzos. And am in total fear of WD. Can someone give me advice on how to taper or what to do. If i could get down to just 6 drops a night I’d be so much easier.


I don’t think there are anymore rc benzo vendors anymore since they bannned them all in China. I know all the big vendors are gone so luckily I have a stock pile to taper. I’m ashamed of who I am now and don’t want to get out of bed anymore I’d rather be addicted to Herion then benzos. I’ve had phenibut withdrawals so I have an Idea about what benzo withdrawals will be like.

Chamomile , Ashwagandha , Lemon Balm, Valerian Root , Magnolia Root Bark , L-Theanine , Agmatine Sulfate , Kava Root, Black Seed Oil supplements should all assist you in optimizing  GABA over Glutamate . 

Ashwaganda also lowers cortisol even in healthy persons which will likely be spiking during W/D.

Like others have said, do not lay in bed for long periods of no sleep as you will associate your bed with anxiety, compounding the problem. 

It’s rough, but wake up at your targeted morning time regardless of how much sleep you got the night before. You can always take mid-day naps to help with fatigue, just not too close to bed time. 

B vitamins are also essential to stress-reduction which serotonin synthesis relies on. 
A few people have MFTHR mutations that don’t absorb common forms of vitamins , so try to find a “coenzyme” Vit. B complex. 

Another options is N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) , which also helps balance glutamate/GABA. 

Your brain’s homeostasis is like a rubber-band you’ve stretched , which now has to snap back.

Basically — strong will , a few GABAergic supplements, and minor CBT sleep training should move your progress along. 

Keep consistent 24 hour dosing with the Diazepam , and don’t go back to your DoC or give up too soon!

I was using the following for maybe about a month and a half:

Bromazolam 2mg - 3 mg/day

Fluclotizolam 0.5mg - 1mg
Alternating days

‐---------------------------------------------

About maybe two weeks ago I switched to Flualprazolam

-Started at about .5mg two or 3 times a day

-By the last two days of those two weeks I was at about 1mg - 1.5mg 2-3 times a day.

‐---------------------------------------------

About 7 days ago I made the mistake of trying out Clonazolam and Flubromazolam.

-I used .25mg Clonazolam 3x day for two days but quit using it bc of rebound anxiety and drastically increased tolerance with very little benefit in terms of effects.

The past 5 days I have been using Flubromazolam.

 -Started with 0.5mg the first day

-gradually upped dosage by .25 for a few days

-Last couple of days and today have been taking about 1.5mg twice a day

‐---------------------------------------------

I realize now that I need to stop before I go too far, but there are no doctors in my area that will prescribe tapering doses of benzos, or benzos for any reason to be honest, which leaves me depending on RC benzos.

‐---------------------------------------------

I cannot get diclazepam so my only options for tapering are the ones I've mentioned above:

-Fluclotizolam

-Bromazolam

-Flualprazolam

-Clonazolam

-Flubromazolam

‐---------------------------------------------

Can someone please give me advice on which one would be best for a taper? I know I have not been using for a really long time, just about two months total, but I already am feeling some intense anxiety and sleeplessness if I go more than 12 hours without the flubromazolam.

From what little I've been able to find, the bromazolam would likely be the best bet, but I'm really not sure and want to get an outside experienced opinion before I choose one to get for the taper.

‐---------------------------------------------

Also, for whichever one you think would work best:

1.What dosage increments should I be reducing the dosages?

2.How often should I be taking it each day at the decreased dose?

3.How long between each decrease should I be using each smaller dose before moving down to the next increment?

4.What would be the ideal dose to completely stop with minimal withdrawal?

I really want to nip this in the bud before it gets messy so any and all advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

It has been at the time of this post 5 days 22 hours since my last dose. It has also been 8 days and 22 hours since my last cigarette. (Only smoked for like 2-3months).
   
Here is the schedule of my doseage(diazepam):
   
8/7 - 15mg
  
8/9 - 30mg
  
8/10 - 25mg
  
8/11 - 11.25mg
  
8/13 - 1.25mg
  
8/14 - 1.25mg
  
8/17 - 23.75mg
  
8/18 - 2.5mg + 0.25mg(of clonazepam)
   
9/6 - 30mg
  
9/15 - 5mg
  
9/16 - 5mg
  
9/17 - 15mg
  
9/18 - 27.5mg
  
9/19 - 17.25mg
  
9/20 - 5mg
  
9/25 - 5mg
  
9/28 - 2.5mg
  
9/30 - 2.5mg
  
So far it has been pretty bad for the past day and a half. My symptoms atleast what I think I have felt is:
  
-anxiety/intense anxiety
  
-feeling of general stress
  
-muscle stiffness/soreness
  
-feeling like I am not existing/everything is fake/i am in a dream
  
-anger
  
-depression
  
-headache
  
-panicky 
  
-some shadow people in my peripheral
  
Do i need to taper a bit more to prevent seizures? I was on the verge of a bad anxiety attack at work today and just hate my existence in general. Also I really don't wanna take benzos but would smoking cigarettes help the withdrawals? Technically, if i am having legitimate benzo withdrawals i would be withdrawaling from both cigarettes and benzos. I just really don't wanna have seizures.",6,0

Have been tapering off 1.5mg of Klonopin for last month and a half (klono user every day for 2.5 years) and pretty quickly noticed bloat, especially AFTER eating. It seems to vary by the day but generally am slightly bloated all day or look 6 months pregnant after random meals. Can benzo belly happen that quick? 

I’ve read about benzo belly but how common is it? Is it something at least 50% or more people experience? The reason I ask is because:

— I may have other gut issues possibly going on since I have Crohn’s disease and may need to get tested for SIBO. Bloating is a huge sign of SIBO. 
— I notice gassiness and grumbles as well after eating so may not be benzo belly related and more gut health related.

I'm addicted heavily to benzos, I take need 4-6mg a day to feel normal. Im scripted those. The problem is my abuse issues, and I've been on them for close to 10 years.


To give an idea of my consideration of abuse/binge is this:


-20-30mg of Xanax or Klonopin (150-200mg of valium in replacement) no Ativan ever as I get a paradoxical reaction. 12-14mg of clonazolam fits as an option as well 


-2 22oz malt liquor high % abv so =5-6 drinks


-2-10 somas, they are a muscle relaxer (tolerance is weird with those, hence the strange number)

This has been pulled back to once or twice a month vs, almost every day or any day I find the pills.

I'm also an addict to opiates. I'm currently a bit over a month clean so that's why they are not in there.It's come to this point where that's what I have to take to feel good. I tried tapering ONCE when I was on 2mg of Klonopin, dumbass gave me a 5 day taper. Needless to say the wds were the worst feeling ever, I just quit heroin for the 3rd time, the last cold turkey, they were a 5 star resort getaway compared to the feeling.

 I cried like a baby getting the refill and just put the thought of being benzo free as an impossibility. I still see it this way, but getting clean off dope, quitting cigarettes, coke etc, I always get depressed knowing I'll be cuffed to benzos forever.

So I thought I could maybe chip away at this but I know I have to stop the binges and abuse. I've been hooked to benzos since I bought my first bar from my weed man when he had 2 didn't know what they really did so sold it to me for $2 to try first lol. 

I'm thinking of just dropping as small as I can, it's difficult with the way teva Klonopins are made. But on months where I'm short (almost every month lol) i get by on 3mg of Klonopin. 

Any info/tips/XP appreciated thanks

So, Im wondering of peoples experience with withdrawal symptoms in the different stages of tapering.

I'm down to 1mg diazepam per day now, and feel absolutely anihilated.. I did not expect this, since the last cuts of 1mg every two weeks are so small in terms of mg's..but I guess when cutting from 2mg to 1mg that is 50%.

Is it the percentage that really matters more than the amount of mg's ? Whats your experience ?

I can’t take anything like Zofran because it makes me even more dizzy, so I don’t know what to do.

Box of 10mg diazepam collected as suspected my issues may be anxiety related. Did not want to see a doctor.
Finished by 14 August so 28 taken total in just under 2 months. Stopped cold turkey, didn't know withdrawal would come on so quickly. 

Prescription given on 24th august when I was taking all the panic attacks. I have not been using them daily maybe every other day or so and usually 4mg max in the day, sometimes 6 on particularly bad ones. I still have 8 of the second prescription left, so 48 2mg tabs taken between 24th August and start of October 

Thursday 23rd of September got another box of 10mg ones.
Took 50mg over the course of 2 days at a festival on 25+26 (30 day one, 20mg about 26 hours later) of September and then 5mg on the 1st and 2nd of October. 

This totals 3 and a half months of benzo usage. Although not taken daily and the middle portion being at quite low doses, however, I am worried about the potential for whithdrawlal + seizures if I just stop them directly. 

Does this seem like a reasonable taper schedule? 
4mg 3x a week for 1 weeks ( 6 tabs)

These last few days I’ve been really pressed because of money, I’m still on daily Zoloft (100mg) with Klonopin (10-15 drops) exclusively for when I can’t sleep (I ran out of it and have no money to get more), and Xanax (2mg) to kinda go throughout the day without crying, raging or simply being able to “work” as an adult after all the trauma I’ve been through the last few months. This weekend I forgot about a ProctorU exam from university on Friday that I paid for and been preparing for weeks, plus there’s the new years planning at work and this same weekend my family had the annual Mormons conference which triggers a lot of my issues with them to a point I’d rather go out not to hear anything about the church and sleep at a park or something.

On Friday night I had like 10 2mg bars of Xanax and took them all at night to stop my brain and hoping being numb enough to sleep. I just woke up 1 1/2 days later without any memory of what happened, with the worst migraine and fever. I work from home so I know for a fact it’s not covid plus I don’t have throat symptoms, but my head is literally killing me I’ve been slowly recalling the fact that I took my last 10 bars to “sleep” which I know was the worst decision and I don’t know what to do. Nobody really cares about me here and they’re watching their little conference thing, while I’m considering the worst in the guests room waiting for a doc I just called. Like 10 years ago I had migraine because another job I used to work at and they gave me tramadol, obviously I don’t I can’t trust myself with any meds at this point (had recreational drug use too in the past, but not anymore) or afford anything else, so I’m here looking for any piece of advice if any of you have ever been in a similar situation like me.

so a lot has happened in my life since I had to go into detox in April and Although I  stayed off of them for 3 months, I started taking xans again around the end of July. 

amongst how crazy my life has been in the last say three months or so due to homelessness, breakdown of my mental health and other factors etc  - my use has got worse and im now back to taking at LEAST 10mg (5 2mg bars) a day, and when I say at least that’s the very base line of my use - I definitely have taken more on quite a few occasions. 

This is a lot less than before I had to go to detox – at that point I was taking 15 bars a day at least, but i’m not excusing my behaviour and I know that was really extreme and the ideal scenario would be for it to be reducing to the most minimal amount if any at all. 

and of course I know this isn’t good safe or any of that and I’m going to start making steps to change it. I hadn’t really had time to reflect on the change in my use until now nor had I really thought that I could be physically dependent on it again, and I guess from what I’ve described I’m definitely emotionally dependent on it. 

But basically right now for the short-term my main concern is whether at this point I am likely to be physically dependent and wether I’d be at risk if I go without any xans for just a day? 

 I’ve got an event coming up on Monday in which I am with family overnight and I really don’t think I are you should even attempt to take them whilst I’m there, it just feels like a really shameful and scummy thing to do. 

But at the same time I don’t wanna ruin it by for example having a seizure or something worse. If I had thought about it and not been in denial about how it’s got then I would’ve tried to reduce drastically for it but obviously it’s so close to the day now and I just don’t know what to expect, do or feel about it.

I already posted last week about my use (https://old.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/ptvhl6/rc_taper_and_jump/) and i have to say thanks to everyone who answered even with questions, it motivated me. 

A ban is coming on Rc Benzo like etizolam and diclazepam, and i feel like it’s a good opportunity to get rid of it. I know I’m not the only one thinking this.

I used benzo since 2016-2017 mostly Rcs.
I am on diazepam since 2018, after a benzo withdrawal related seizure. (daily 4~5mg around 17h00/ 5pm).
I used etizolam (1,5mg a day) for a year and a half, and diclazepam (0,5-1mg daily) for year, but i tapered diclazepam to a 1/8 of a mg this year.

Anyway, since the 29/09 i « cold turkeyed » my tiny diclazepam at night ( about 1/8 of a mg not a lot i know, to each their struggle) , and started tapering etizolam by reducing my original 1,5mg a day to 1,2mg a day ( i read a study about the 0,3mg reduction being bearable) and i plan to reduce this dose every 10 to 15 days. 
I know it’s been a year and a half since i took it daily but my use was not that high ( the maximum i did this year was maybe 3mg once), and i have diazepam daily that i can increase if i feel too much febrile. 
I won’t lie i didn’t sleep that good as usual this week but i want to make it, and take a another try at this life thing.
I post this message just to be sure i’m on the good path and not doing it wrong because here i read and find people with the same struggle.

I have built a tolerance and dependence but i dont want to up my dosage, i want off. I feel stuck. Because even where im at right now, not even tapering, im having massive panic attacks and psychosis episodes. Ive been awake for so long. Around 130 in the morning i had a huge episode and wanted nothing more than for it to stop or just die. I cannot sleep, im so scared. I think i may check in somewhere Monday to stay and get help.

 Ive been trying to split my 1/4th of 0.5 up throughout the day and see if i can take less but i never can without having psychotic episodes that wont cease until i take the rest and even then im still super anxious and panic attacks. I cant imagine actually tapering. I cant do it without having something else to keep the bad, scary things from happening. And then when if i can get off, I'll need something to take daily. I'll basically be back at square 1 except i took a detour to hell along the way. Im just really terrified my brain feels all wrong. Im scared for what the future holds and dont know if i have enough fight left in me to do it and not lose whats remaining of my sanity in the process. I'm 24 and my life may as well be over.

Ive been having these bad experiences since March. I thought i was just worse off than i thought so i started taking the klonopin daily. I didnt know that that was happening because of my dependency and it's gotten so much worse since then. Had i known in March what was actually happening i wouldve tried to get off then instead of worsening it. I wish i never took it.

I have had anxiety for around 40 years and depression for 25.  I was on antidepressants for about 15 years, but have been off them for four.

I was managing ok, then things got hard earlier this year.  I have been in the middle of very intense trauma therapy, as well as a move between cities and houses, and some other health issues, and a relationship breakup.  And basically I stopped sleeping, maybe an hour or two a night.  And none of the supplements I tried worked, including melatonin, cbd, valerian, etc.

So for a while I was using around 15mg oxazepam a night to sleep.  Then my psychiatrist added low dose seroquel (50mg) because the oxazepam wasn’t working.  Then I switched from oxazepam to diazepam at night, generally around 5mg but some nights as high as 10mg.  And I would take oxazepam during the day as needed.  Many days I didn’t take any; some days I would take 15 or 20mg total.

Some nights I would sleep four or five hours; some nights I would still only sleep two or three.  The occasional oxazepam on stressful days helped, and I wasn’t increasing my dose - in fact I was going the other way.  I find 7.5mg once or maybe twice a day will get me through and then I can stop for a few days after that.

Still I don’t want to be on anything, so I’ve been trying to come off.  I’ve now been off the valium for two weeks, and the seroquel for four or five days.  I was taking oxazepam instead of the valium to sleep - 7.5mg at bedtime and then 7.5mg again if (when!) I woke up in the night.  Last night I substituted zopiclone for the oxazepam and slept well.

But if I don’t take anything, then I don’t sleep, and that seems bad.  The insomnia isn’t worse than it was before the meds, but it isn’t better.  Same with the anxiety.  I can figure out other ways to cope with anxiety, but not sleeping really hurts.

Anybody have any similar experiences and figured out a way to sleep without the addictive medications?

I've quit Klonopin/opiate's and heroin twice this year. I'm back up to 3mg kpins and every other day I'll take 4-5mg. My first quit was horrific. Doc pulled me off at 1mg and I was locked in my house for a month out of my mind. Another doctor who I traveled 6 hours to put me on 3mg possibly higher if I want but we agreed on 3.

After that my cravings for opiates took off again and I went on another run, ended up in rehab and kicking them wasn't so bad I was smart and told them I'm taking twice what I am and had a nice Subutex taper. Didn't do the same with benzos though I should have. Obviously it's a detox center and you can't stay forever so they did a 6 day Ativan taper.
I never really recovered from that. So about a month or so after rehab I called in my script and back off of to the races I went. This time it would be benzos only. Wrong. Called the dope man about a week later and have been dabbling ever since just not enough to fully go into withdrawal when I'm without. 

Long story somewhat short my dad laid down ground rules after rehab and I obviously broke them, I started drinking a pint of vodka with my Klonopin whenever I wouldn't score oxys. Came home from a girls house trashed I'm lucky I made it home or didn't kill someone and my parents are done with me now I'm living out my car and in shitty hotel rooms. I also lost my job because I start a new one on the 12th but I blew that last night. 

I was at this motel, drinking taking my usual Klonopin dosage and my neighbor had their door open having a party so I wondered in and we kicked it and I smoked a bunch of weed and did a line of coke. HR is going to call any day for me to piss test and I'm nearly broke now so that's fucked.

Idk what to do , I mean I had everything going okay when I got back on the Klonopin I got my life back. But at the same time these things make me impulsive and I just don't give a fuck on them and do stupid shit. I'm at a cheap motel getting plastered next door to some hooker now. She's been getting fucked all day so gotta be a hooker doors constantly opening and closing and only my bathroom light works no tv nothing lol. I took it to far this time and idk if I'm gonna make it out. I have a check from my last job I just have to pickup but I hope I don't blow it on dope.

For a couple weeks I couldn’t sleep before 2am which, luckily for me isn’t terrible for me now, but when I get another job that won’t fly and i’m planning on it soon so I had to figure something out. 

Doxylamine and melatonin/zzz quill ‘pure sleep’ have both been super helpful however they only work if i’m already wound down, not if I need help winding down. Enter taurine 

I saw that it was a weak gaba agonist and reported to activate glycine receptors, also reported to restore the gaba/glutamate balance and this is what really intrigued me. I figured i’d be willing to take the chance of a rebound to see if it would help or not. It’s been an amazing help. I take it around an hour before I want to go to bed and it’s really helped me wind down. 

As far as rebound, I have experienced none whatsoever. Ive taken it for close to three weeks now with a couple multi day breaks to test and see if I would miss it and so far so good, no rebound anxiety and no worsened sleep when not taking it even for 2-3 days.

But my doctors think i only take 0.5mg 4 times a week amd they rhought that was too much. They refused to up my dosage and i see why. I have only had 3 hours of sleep going on two days now and im not the least bit tired.


When im desperate to sleep I take 4mg xanax and i only feel relaxed and calm not even sleepy

My current doctor is adament about not increasing my dosage so I was thinking about switching doctors and trying explain what im taking and how much a day so I can try to get on klonopin which I have heard has less of a tolerance issue.. then maybe get some sleeoing medication

I dont know what to do i really wanna get on kpin so i dont have to worry about seizures from not dosing properly and its half life etc since its so long acting. Idealy i want to still try and find an alternative but in the mean time i dont want to have to worry about seizing out.

Since doctors can only see what i share should i try an independent doctor and explain my usage and issues and see if they are willing to help me?

I don’t think I have the physical will to get off on my own. Addiction is a fucking bitch. This drug literally has ruined my life and so many opportunities however has saved me when I was at my lowest. Love/Hate,9,0
