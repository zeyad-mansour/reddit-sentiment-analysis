2021-11-29 19:09:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/r59le1/psychiatrist_fired_me/,Psychiatrist Fired Me,"I have been on 25 mg of Diazepam for ~3 weeks. I started on 40 in august when my old psychiatrist kept me on that high dose for 10 months and I decided to taper down to 35 and find a new psychiatrist who wasn’t pumping me with benzodiazepines. Since my drop I’ve experienced really bad depression and concentration skills and and asked for two more weeks to stabilize on 25 mg before jumping down to 20 like she suggested. She said no. I’ve been tapering 5 mg a month but it’s only been 3 weeks since I jumped to 25 from 30 (I jumped in early November) and I’m worried about suicidal ideation which I experienced with my last drop. I asked for her to let me stabilize for another two weeks and she said no, and since I’m not complying, she will no longer work with me and I have been banned from the practice. She said I’m tapering too slowly. Then she said in January she’s gonna jump me from 20 mg to 10 mg. That’s too large of a jump. Any decent psychiatrist would know that. And I said that’s a terrible plan and she got angry and said if I was suicidal to ""just go to the hospital"" and now I have been blacklisted from the entire psychiatric office. I asked her if I could see a different psychiatrist there while crying my eyes out and she said no and I’d have to go to a completely different psychiatrist office. I have finals these next two weeks and will fail my exams. I wouldn’t wish benzo tapering or withdrawal on my worst enemy, I’ve been through worse in life but I’m a full time student who’s suffering at the expense of a fast taper I’m not comfortable with, and now I no longer have a psychiatrist. I am shocked but maybe I shouldn’t be because I have yet to meet a single decent psychiatrist who cares about the well-being of their patients. As a psychology student about to graduate, I am embarrassed to be studying this field, I am embarrassed by the lack of empathy in the healthcare system, I am embarrassed by how much money is prioritized over a patients wellbeing. There’s no excuse for it. I actually wrote an essay for my biological psychology class on medications being over prescribed, the lack of empathy and medical knowledge from the psychiatric field a few weeks ago and it was selected and published in my school newsletter, and I go to a school with 40,000 students so that’s a pretty big deal. I explained the situation to my mom and she took my psychiatrists side. I feel alone and hopeless. I want off this shit and I always said slow and steady wins the race and I wanted to do this slowly so I’d have minimal discomfort. I’ve had a seizure before, I’m at risk, and the fact that any psychiatrist would taper this quickly is disgusting. I have made it clear I want off this garbage, but I didn’t ask for a quick taper. Psychiatrist also said when I first met her the ashtons manual was outdated. I see no way out. I can’t breathe.",35

Here in the UK, it is INCREDIBLY difficult to get prescribed diazepam, even if you make it clear, present all the information you've been given and being under the care of a drug and alcohol organisation.

The only way I ever got prescribed diazepam was when I went to the out-of-hours GP and let my regular GP know that I cannot in any way go cold turkey, I did get prescribed 2mg diazepam tablets, but even then I just gave up because I had to phone up the doctor's surgery just to get a prescription and it was like jumping through hoops, so yeah, I ended up just purchasing the diazepam online instead. 

Now here's the issue, buying diazepam online rarely if ever, comes in anything but 10mg.

What's the best thing for me to do? Contacting my GP is not an option because I'll just be fobbed off as an addict and they will refuse to prescribe. 

I just want to know the best way I can reduce my dosage using only 10mg pills, I am going to buy a pill cutter, but I don't think I'd be able to make 1/8th cuts.

Just wondering if someone could chime in who's had similar experiences.",2

Here are my other posts that cover my benzo recovery:

[Finally hit a tapering milestone! (aka my wild saga of trying to get below 0.25 Klonopin)](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/nroelt/finally_hit_a_tapering_milestone_aka_my_wild_saga/)

[I jumped off Klonopin today!](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/pe3an0/i_jumped_off_klonopin_today/)

Overall, I'm doing well. I expected to hit another period of acute symptoms after quitting the benzos completely, but that never materialized. No new symptoms popped up post-taper that I didn't have either before or during my taper. So the good news is that I'm functional, living my life, working full-time, and getting back to my freelance writing work on top of my other job. I volunteer at my kid's school and sing along to Stevie Nicks (my Klonopin recovery hero) in my kitchen. I exercise (walking or slow jogging + weight training) 6x a week. I eat pretty much the same foods over and over, but I was able to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner without throwing myself out of whack. (Back to no gluten, no soy, and limited sugar and dairy after Thanksgiving, though.)

One thing I'm really grateful for is that I'm not currently dealing with mental symptoms. I can look back at my taper and now see clearly the phases of mania and depression I went through. Those were rough, and could have been more consequential than they were (example: during some mania last winter, I tried to sell my house and literally all my stuff. Fortunately, this didn't work). Trusted family and friends have commented on how much I seem like me. That's good -- I feel like me again too.

I've never had a windows / waves pattern. I went from OK to REALLY BAD to marginally better, all while still on benzos. Then I would have a new symptom pop up for, say, two weeks, and go away just as suddenly as it arrived, never to be heard from again. The symptoms I'm still dealing with have been around for a long time.

**laurenishere's symptoms rodeo:**

*2020 symptoms that never change:*

24/7 jaw tremor: remarkably consistent since July 2020

24/7 eye floaters: remarkably consistent since August 2020

24/7 tinnitus: remarkably consistent since September 2020

&#x200B;

*2021 (taper) symptoms that I'm optimistic about:*

insomnia: This peaked when I was at 0.125 Klonopin. I was in the 0 - 3 hour range for the whole latter half of my taper. I started seeing improvement at about a month off Klonopin. Now I'm comfortably around 5 - 6 hours most nights. It's still broken up for now, but I think that will improve.

muscle jerks / nerve twitches / hypnic jerks / restless legs: This all feels like part of the same thing. It's getting better! I used to jerk awake every night, or be tortured by restless legs during the hours of 1am - 5am. This rarely happens anymore.

POTS: Actually, this is a 2020 symptom that felt absolutely catastrophic when it appeared, as the tachycardia left me bedbound for months. Now it's improved to the point that I can deal with it. I don't monitor it w/ a pulse ox anymore. It's predictable to where I know if I'm doing chores or cooking, I WILL have to sit down at the 30-minute mark or it'll feel like my heart is going to pop out of my chest. But I'm really thankful for those 30 minutes.

Pulsatile tinnitus: This one has actually gotten *worse* recently. I hate it. It only happens when I'm lying down. I've decided to cut caffeine for 2 - 3 weeks and see if I have any improvement. (I've been able to have 1/4 cup of coffee with oatmilk without much consequence. But maybe over time it's been revving up cortisol. Dunno!)

**FAQs:**

**How did you taper?** Water taper method. Started w/ 0.25 Klonopin and 300ml water. Tapered from 12/25/2020 to 08/28/2021. (Highest dose before that was 1.0 mg.)

**Isn't that pretty long?** I guess for some people. But I needed to stay functional to work full-time.

**Did you have a doctor help you taper?** No. I looked for a psychiatrist but eventually gave up. The GP who prescribed this shit to me kept prescribing it, with few questions asked. He probably doesn't even know I quit taking it.

**Were you kindled?** I don't know. I took benzos before, but a long time ago (December 2000 - July 2001). Would that have still been affecting my nervous system in July 2020? Maybe? Also, having to updose before doing a proper taper wasn't GREAT, but it was the only way for me to get stable.",6

Basically just ruined all of that last Tuesday I got kicked out of a telly and was dopesick I decided to go to the ER and don't remember that just look back at text with my ma and I apparently went home that morning and packed for rehab. I just got out of inpatient after 6 days there and looking back at text pictures and my room and just everything is so overwhelming how I have like nothing left. My boss isn't answering even though we had a really good relationship and I was honest idk and I was feeling good like all week thought I was ready to get out and do good but these feelings I've had been suppressed because I just didn't know they were there and was constantly distracted by groups and TV and food and everyone there.

I'm 18 and have been through it all and somehow I still got my family but I'm in debt like 400$ and honestly don't feel like leaving or doing anything but I'm going to try and get to a meeting tonight :/ that's what not even 12 days of xanax has done to me.

After many months of tapering, I was finally at a low enough etizolam dose that I could switch over to my remaining supply of diazepam. I tapered down to 1mg and finally discontinued last night. 

Believe it or not, even though my diazepam dose was extremely low, I'm feeling it. I crashed last night, only from external factors (jet lagged, exhaustion from the day) but found myself wide awake with a migraine and extreme facial pain around 1am. That puts me at about 36 hours since my last dose when withdrawal symptoms began. It's now about 9am and I have the classic pounding chest, hot/cold flashes, facial pain/tension and an upset stomach. 

I know it will be a rough few days but I'm hoping that I'll essentially ""level out"" at my new dose of 0. Usually I leveled out within a week or two, so really hoping for the same this time. But even if it takes much longer than that, I've come off etizolam completely, switched to an arguably much safer drug and managed to taper that down and discontinue it's usage. I used to sometimes think ""fuck it, I'll just take etiz for the rest of my life"". I honestly can't imagine how shitty and short my life would have been if I continued that way.

Keep fucking going. There is light at the end of the tunnel.",5

During that time I also abused various other substances including a several year addiction to opiates.  After losing my job and totaling my car, I finally decided to stop this nonsense.  

Now I have a new job that doesn’t suck. I’m mobile again, working on my health and genuinely sober for the first time in my adult life. However, I’ve been watching emails come in from various etizolam, rc and kratom vendors. I even looked up the closest kratom store to my work and thought about driving there at lunch.  I’m bored with sobriety, anxious about work, the holidays and everything else. I’ve been fantasizing about drinking as well.  This year I actually got myself a hotel room so I don’t have to be around my family the entire time. I knew that would trigger me and I wanted some privacy.

Has anyone else ever found that boredom or anxiety lead them back into addiction? I imagine I’d waste the money only to regret it.  Still, it’s on my mind. Not so much a physical demand, more mental and emotional. Hopefully I’m doing the right thing by being honest with myself.  I’m not a one and done type person. I like to do drugs everyday.

I took mucho melatonin and slept most of the night. I do think that I *did* somewhat taper down a bit during the few weeks before I ran out and has to be one reason I am not aching and sweating or feeling like death.  My body feels strange but it's nothing like what it was to go without heroin when I was younger or Tramadol when I abused those for a few years.  That is why I think I must have done a better job at tapering than I'd thought because I know from multiple videos and other stories that benzos withdrawal is the absolute worst and most dangerous.  
   Anyways - here is my question for you experts: tomorrow is Monday and I believe my RX will be filled. **What should I do?**  At the time I will be going past the pharmacy it will be 72 hours without any alprazolam.  Would I be smart to just NOT take any of the alprazolam if I am already this far?  Or does this danger zone last much longer than a few days and should I just try to do .25mg for a couple of days?  Obviously I then run the risk of having a bad day and taking more, etc.  I'm hoping to only go through this once if possible!

I am so upset right now...,"I am so pissed off. Here's my background: I took .5 mg Ativan every 2 - 3 days (one of those nights I took 1mg dose). I took this medication **for** **LESS THAN 2 WEEKS**. The last time I took Ativan was **20 DAYS AGO.**

For several days now, I was going back and forth debating on whether the symptoms I was feeling were benzo related or were purely anxiety related. I literally posted on here two days ago trying to figure this out. I really thought it was just anxiety. Guess not.

I stopped taking supplements because I did research that certain supplements could worsen your withdrawal symptoms or cause setbacks. I wanted to be safe just in case, so I stopped taking supplements altogether ever since my last dose. I SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT GOING.

I really thought I was not going through withdrawal and wanted to focus on treating my severe anxiety symptoms. So I started taking L-theanine a few days ago and it helped. Only took it that one time and the whole day I felt great until it wore off. I researched that magnesium helps with anxiety so I bought a magnesium oil spray and I bought magnesium glycinate supplements. I used it the first time yesterday. I lightly sprayed the magnesium oil spray a few times on my feet in the afternoon and it made me tired so I took a nap. Didn't help much with the ""anxiety symptoms"" though. So I took ONE (100mg) magnesium glycinate supplement later at night to help with sleep.

Later that evening, I felt this **soreness/weakness in my left ankle** that I remembered initially having when I first stopped the Ativan. That soreness lasted for a week or so then it went away. Well it's back! That should've been my first sign before I popped that Mg supplement. Later, other symptoms (that I put in bold) came back. **DP/DR felt worse**, **adrenaline surge came back, balance issues,** terrible muscle tension in arms/neck, **severe** **chills**, **extreme fatigue,** hypersensitivity to cold, visual disturbance, tinnitus, **internal tremors (mainly in head),** extreme weakness. I took 20 mg hydroxyzine last night and it helped but barely. I really want to take L-theanine but I'm afraid to take now. I can't believe this. I was healing and I didn't even know it and now I messed it all up! This is ridiculous. It's the next day and I feel slightly better but I also don't.",1

When I started taking 1mg of Xanax when needed (social anxiety/panic disorder) I felt like a god.

Felt anxious? Panic attack? Pop a Xanax and in twenty minutes it was all gone. I also liked the high, which eventually got me chasing the dragon. I have tried bunch of different drugs before and never got hooked, actually I hated being high from weed or opiates.

Maybe a month or two later I was popping 6-8mg a day just for the high. I was hooked, I couldn't stop. At this point I have almost zero memories, i was completely blacked out all the time.

Fast forward a couple months, now I'm doing 15-20mg of Alprazolam daily. If I didn't get high, I added opiates, alcohol or other benzos such as Clonazepam, Etizolam or Diazepam. One day I had a moment of clarity and realized I've been doing 30mg of Alprazolam a day for a week and felt absolutely disgusted.

So I stopped cold turkey, thinking ""it's only been a few months I'm fine."" And honestly, I felt completely normal until the third day when I had a tonic-clonic seizure for five minutes. I woke up with EMTs in my living room and was hospitalised for a night. 

The first week after the seizure was a hell on earth, I had huge withdrawals, I was very paranoid, I slept 1-2 hours a night. It's now been two weeks since it happened and this was my first day of not feeling any symptoms, so I decided to write this wall of text. A guide how to do everything wrong. Stay safe!",39

I was hospitalized 6 weeks ago and the psychiatrist on the unit I'm on wouldn't give me an equivalent dosage (logical, I know). I asked him to switch me to Tranxene (clorazepate), but I just saw that there is no drinkable solution...

So I thought of Valium (diazepam). I'm currently taking 10 mg of Tranxene per day in 2 doses (1 capsule of 5 mg in the morning, the same dose in the evening).

So far, I feel stable.

But I really want to find the right words to convince the shrink that Valium would be ideal for me.

https://www.benzo.org.uk/bzequiv.htm

15 mg of Tranxene = 10 mg of Valium.

So if I go straight to 10 mg of Valium, can it work?

I don't want to use too technical terms in front of the psychiatrist, otherwise he'll think I'm ""superior"" to their expertise...",1

I know when I was going through withdrawal I was desperately searching for actually positive messages where people successfully got off benzos instead of the hundreds of horror stories!

I was taking about 4mg of Xanax a day for a year.  I tapered down to zero over the course of about 6 weeks, they sucked but weren't too horrible. The first few days after my last dose were bad - insomnia, anxiety, sweating, nausea, etc.  After a few days my symptoms started to improve, so I thought I was through the worst of it. But around day 10 I started just feeling overwhelming anxiety.  This lasted about 4-5 days, and through this period  I strongly considered relapsing with a small dose, but was able to resist. 

Then one morning around day 15 I realized I had slept through the night for the first time in what seemed like forever. My anxiety was still there a little, but much better than previous days. Over the next few days my sleep continued to get better, I felt less anxious. By 4 weeks my brain fog had lifted, I was sleeping normally, my mood had improved.  Really the only thing that scared me was tinnitus - I'm not sure if I developed this from the benzo withdrawal or not, but even the tinnitus started to fade and was completely gone by week 6. Now I'm at week 8 of no benzos and feel better than ever.

I hope this helps someone get through their journey a little easier. It's hard as hell, but just keep reminding yourself it's temporary and you will get through it. Don't let the horror stories you read on the internet scare you like they scared me. You got this.",24

Most of my doses have been low like when I go days without taking it I will take .25mg just to keep the withdrawal at bay and not so bad … so my question is . Is 2 weeks on .25mg good enough to quit cold turkey after ? I could also do a few weeks of only using .25mg every few days then going cold turkey until someone’s willing to help …. I truly need the medicine and I have this big job opportunity coming up and I really don’t want to mess this up by having panic attacks and anxiety… I also have chronic pain but that’s another subject.

I started by taking maybe 0.5mg a day, and had to up the dose regularly. Yesterday I had to have 1.5mg just to function normally. I expect to require the same dose today.
In the beginning xanax made me feel high and very calm now it's barely enough to just keep the shaking away. 

Anyways my last day is Tuesday and I planned on stopping right then and there.
From what I read it's generally OK to stop cold turkey after just 3 weeks? But I'm concerned, seeing how fast my body built tolerance to it.
It's very possible that I will be up to 2mg in Tuesday. Should I taper back to 0.25mg over a few days?
I just don't like the idea of prolonging my exposure to the thing for a week or two in order to taper when I only took it for 3, you know?

I’m trying so hard, I am just over 5 months off prescribed benzos, but 17 months into an ordeal that includes a toxic reaction to an anti biotic, an SSRI and then benzos. 

I am such a productive, positive and happy person by nature and this experience is tearing my fucking soul out. I might make a tiny bit of progress in my windows but it all comes crashing down again in my waves. 

I don’t feel like myself and most people, bar a few very close to me, have given up on me, because they don’t understand this situation and cbf to. I can’t work still (I’m a teacher) and I am so fucking depressed I think about suicide daily at the moment just to end the suffering. 

For me in my waves, on my worst days still, I can hardly leave the house. I feel like I could sleep for days, feel depression like I’ve never felt before, nauseous, all over body aches like the flu, burning brain, tinnitus, DRDP; the list goes on and on. 

It’s the basic things that I’ve lost that make me feel like life is so excruciating to get through. For instance, I see a lot of people say on here that exercise helps them a lot. I can vouch for that when I’ve managed it too….However, I go through periods of weeks at a time where I’m lucky if I shower and make it to the couch. This feels cruel in itself because I LOVE exercise, I WANT so badly to workout, to feel good. I used it to manage my anxiety and depression long before this. But I’m physically unable.

I use to be on 3mg of clonazepam a day, so I made some progress in my opinion. I hate the long lasting nature of clonazepam. I heard that Xanax works fast and doesn’t last as long. That would be perfect for my situation because I only need it for the onset of bad anxiety/panic attacks. I have worked with my therapist for tools I can use while having moderate anxiety so I don’t need to take a clonazepam. How would I ask my doctor to switch? He is very open and easy to talk to, but I know some doctors believe that Xanax has the potential for more abuse then clonazepam due to its short acting nature. Any advice we’ll help, thanks!",0

In late October (October 25th) I checked myself into a mental hospital for suicidal ideation. I was given Wellbutrin which caused extreme anxiety. To counteract the anxiety I was given Lorazepam. During this time I was also prescribed blood pressure medications for my anxiety which has caused Tinnitus. The Tinnitus has been going on for a few weeks now.

In this process I'm trying to taper off Lorazepam ASAP because I've been on it longer than a month now. I've read online how tappering off benzos can cause tinnitus and I don't want to add to it. I really want my T to go away. 

Here is the schedule my N.P. has me on. I was originally taking 2mg a day, after two weeks I've gone down to 1 1/2 mg. Then in 2 weeks down to 1 mg, then 2 weeks .5. 

My question is, is this too fast of a tapper? I can't chance getting permanent tinnitus from this. In fact my N.P. wanted to keep me on benzos because of the blood pressure meds causing tinnitus. This isn't the first time medication has given me T, in past experiences it clears up in a few weeks to 6 months but reading about withdrawals from benzos I'm absolutely terrified I won't go away this time.

I don't trust my N.P. at this point that she's properly tappering me off.

I had some of these symptoms before I started taking Ativan but a lot of these are new symptoms, never experienced them before. At times they increase in intensity (like the tinnitus, for example). Just last night, I started feeling this tingling/crawling sensation all over my head (very unsettling). This new symptom is what’s freaking me out.

They (usually) have no problem writing prescriptions amd getting people hooked but then vastly exaggerate how easy it would be to quit.

I've been on Klonopin for 18 years. I attempted to quit five years ago but couldn't quite do it. I dropped from 3mg a day to 0.25mg a day. I was horribly sick for months.

I see a doctor that I'll call Dr. B. She is a general practitioner but she said she would continue to prescribe my K if I was tapering. I set up a water titration plan and I've stuck to it. I was very confident and excited about this plan. 

I needed to see a doctor but Dr. B was unavailable so I saw a different doctor, who I will call Dr. Shit. I went to Dr. Shit and he completely avoided all of the symptoms I was presenting with (girl issues) and decided that changing my psych meds was what he needed to do. So he switched my SSRI amd told me to just stop taking my K. 

I continued to taper and got down to the last refill I would need. My refill request went to Dr. Shit for some reason instead of Dr. B. He refused it. I sent it to Dr. B. She said that Dr. Shit told her I no longer needed it and to not fill it.

So, I needed 48 pills to successfully complete my taper. Now I have to do it with 3. I genuinely do not understand why doctors think they can decide whether or not someone is going to go into withdrawal. How hard is it to get fucking educated on something that is rapidly turning into an epidemic? It's pathetic and terrifying.

For the entire 60 days, possibly longer, I have had some strange issues with balance which has increased in severity the last 2 weeks. 

Symptoms- I cant sit in a seating position or lay on my back without feeling slightly spinny and nauseous. More severe while sitting in a chair, which is stopping me from participating in recreational activities and group activities here at rehab. They think it is laziness and want to throw me out.

A pressure in the right side of my forehead that feels like sinusitus. Anti-inflammatory OTC does nothing to improve this. 

While sitting, one side of my head feels heavier, and causes a motion sickness sensation.

Ability to concentrate has gotten so bad that it almost feels like an attention disorder, both because my brain can't focus, and also being so uncomfortable and can not relax enough to focus. Even watching Youtube videos is near impossible.

Meds I take: Clonidine 0.1mg, Remeron 15mg (have been on this for a year), Olanzapine 10mg, and Keppra 500mg 2/day. Just went through a week of taking an antibiotic as well with no luck (thinking possible sinusitus would clear up).

I am posting this as a last ditch effort to see if anyone knows or has experienced vertigo and lightheadedness this severe while going through withdrawals. Suicidal thoughts have become an issue now because of the intense discomfort and inability to be active. I have just seen an ENT who gave me no relative information and told me to come back in a month for follow-up testing (pretty pissed about this). People tell me I am still going through withdrawal, but honestly the symptoms feel much more on the physical side. I am tempted to taper off one med at a time to see if it is a cause, since most of the medication I take have dizziness as a side effect. Any suggestions?",3

Hi guys, I’ve been addicted to diazepam for 4 years, always taken stupidly without a prescription. Initially as needed, then 5 mg daily before bedtime until I reached 10 20 mg daily.

This summer, I talked to my psychiatrist about how I wanted to get clean. He sent me to a public clinic where I spent 22 days.

I tapered from 10mg to 0 in 9 days (I know it’s not advisable, is crazy,and it’s extremely hard but it seems like they do it nowadays) suffering I managed it, meanwhile I was given 50mg of quetiapine to sleep until I reached a dose of 100 mg (50mg normal + 50mg retard).

Now I’m 70 days off from Benzo and I’m slowly starting to feel human again, although I still have some unexpected anxiety attacks and some problems with concentration and attention.

I talked to my psychiatrist about taking some supplements for anxiety and to recover the brain after years of bombing.

In her opinion, supplements are counterproductive because they hinder the brain’s natural recovery.

What is your experience in this regard and if you took supplements during your recovery from benzo, which ones helped you?",2

So far it’s been ok. Physical symptoms are very minimal if any. The most disconcerting thing is this feeing like my head is filled with helium, or an empty feeling. It shows up when I try to make the jump to .75. Seems like there’s a muddying of my cognition too, though not sure if it’s any worse than it has been the past few months on the full dose.

I think the benzos are linked to my anger issues. It's almost impossible to anger me when im not on benzos.

I started taking benzos nearly about 10 years ago, started with a xanax script, then about 1mg klonopin a day for the past 8 or so, except for about 6 months last year I didnt have access to them... I got into the REALLY bad ones. If you know you know, if you dont you dont need to. That led me to completely ruining a relationship and any chance of ever renewing it. When I got back to my home state, i looked so fucking bad when i looked in the mirror after stopping the bad shit and getting back on 1mg kpin, it was hard to recognize myself. My cheeks were sunked in, i was using other substances as well, all fucking kinds, but those are not my problem, and i no longer am, except benzos. I honestly don't know how the fuck im alive but i have a theory that Kratom works as an an opioid antigonist and that is the ONLY reason I'm alive. Seriously. (used actual opioids for the first time in like 6 years after getting back while on immense benzo doses,) I was doing all those drugs out of pure depression, but not benzos. These have a grip on me and its very hard to confront a doctor because honestly I don't have a prescription since I had the Xanax like 10 years ago.

I'm also bipolar which is maybe kind of mixed with mild aspergers meltdowns(I don't usually bring that condition up because it's almost not noticable, you'd have to really know me)  and not properly medicated I think, but at the same time I think my old psychologist was right in saying I'm probably better off if i can do this without meds. I would sure prefer it that way. I just fucking destroyed one of my computer monitors like an hour ago dude, and it wasnt from gaming or anything trust me. I have fucked up my life pretty bad.

I quit for over about 2 months straight back in may to july. It was pretty bad, but honestly I think opioids were worse for me. The only part that kind of scared me was I think I had very minor seizures in my sleep. Would wake up sore and sometimes id catch myself almost falling into a seizure as I fell asleep.  I think I was starting to get my mind back.

10 years. What the fuck do I have to do to stop this for good?",4

Reading all the horror stories made me really anxious and I want to stop. I've been taking 0.25mg a day so lowest possible. I have tried missing a dose a couple of times but I also find I get incredibly anxious towards the end of the day if I don't take it and end up caving in and taking it again. I recognise I'm taking a very low dose for a very short amount of time, so I wonder if it would be ok for me to just stop straight away or do it slowly? I have 0.25mg pills so technically I could half them, but if not needed I kind of want to just stop.

I am a bit worried though because I'm taking it for a sensory disorder and tried many things but benzos seem to be the only thing that helps. I have heard of people staying on a low dose for years and not having issues, but from reading stuff about it I feel like that would still be a big risk?",2

I was still in college and I started having these fearful urges to leave the grocery store. Then I had a major panic attack on the highway and had to call emergency responders. I later discovered it was panic and was prescribed clonazepam. The honeymoon period was like a year and a half. I remember thinking is this what normal feels like? I was no longer anxious or worrying about things. I was able to fly, again. Took trips around the world. Did a study abroad in France. 

Over the years things gradually went back to square one. I developed a fear of driving on the highway. My anxiety and panic is much worse than it was before I started taking this crap.

Discovered Benzo Buddies and developed a fear of tapering. Bought all the tools. The jewelers scale, graduated cylinders, different sizes of ml syringes for liquid tapering. I would dissolve a full dose and feel defeated because it took so much f'ing work. My doctor was never on board with any of these methods. She wanted to cut and hold .5 tabs and told me I'd never find another doctor who would go slower.

Finally found a new doctor who actually read the Ashton Manual. Had experience tapering one patient over 2 years. Thankfully a lot of the decisions have been left up to me. I initially wanted to crossover to Valium but the Ashton Manual even says clonazepam patients might find this difficult. So we put a plan together with ODT tabs. 

Morning dose is now .5 tab, 1/2 .5 tab (.25), .125 ODT tab and 1/2 a .125 ODT tab. Night dose is just a 1 mg tab. So my first cut is .0625 mg. 

I know this is slow and even the pharmacist was giving me dirty looks because going this slow is not very common. I just did the cut, so my anxiety is a little heightened but what else can I expect? I've been in tolerance withdrawal, so I hope I one of those lucky cases that starts to feel better further into the taper.

I also want to leave hope for those struggling to find a benzo educated doctor. It took me 13 years! 

The manufacturer of my ODT tabs is Sun. They come in a regular bottle, not a blister pack. I couldn't find any info on being able to cut these but so far they cut fine. They actually cut better than my .5 tabs that are scored and meant to be cut.",16

I usually never totally run out, but today I’m totally out of the med. the office is about to close for the day, and I went out drinking (not the usual for me at all) but was goaded into going out by a family member and ended up blacking out. 

Now I’m worried that someone I was drinking with may have drugged my drink which led to the blackout. (I think I just accidentally overdid it). 

With the urine compliance check, if any illegal substances came back during the check I would not be prescribed the medication any longer to continue the taper. 

Anyway, my mind always plays tricks on me on what could possibly go wrong anytime I totally run out? 
Anyone else?",10

It's taken me over 4 years to get from a prescription of 4 mg a day down to .047 a day.

I've also been prescribed Depakote for almost a decade, for no particularly good reason, and my doctor and I both want me off it. I was on 500 mg for years, got down to 250 mg about two years ago, and will try to go to 0 as quickly as I can after stopping Klonopin. 

My question is how much worse is the end of Depakote withdrawal going to be as compared to Klonopin? Depakote isn't a benzo but does affect GABA. With both medications, each drop has resulted in excruciatingly unpleasant brain zaps and general odd head sensations as though I've had way too much caffeine. I've never had a seizure but after years of taking both of these, I'm terrified of having one during withdrawal. But I need my life back and don't have the luxury of a lot of time to take this super slowly.",1

Not a lot of people post their success stories and I know everybody reacts differently to withdrawal, but I wanted to share mine. I was using Etizolam daily since January and got up to about 4mg a day. I used an aggressive taper (one that people here don't recommend) of cutting down my dosage to 2mg, then 1 mg, then 1 mg every other day to eventually every 3 days. This was done over about 6 weeks and I won't lie, it was horrible. 

I decided I had enough of waiting and jumped off two Sundays ago. The first 4-5 days were pretty brutal but it got better a lot faster than I expected. 

I took GABA, l-theanine, valerian root, melatonin, and THC to get through the insomnia the first few days. By the end of the first week, I felt 90% normal. Last Thursday I decided to jump off of the THC (I have been using it daily for 6-7 years). I haven't been sleeping well but I do feel the best I have felt since I can remember.

Everybody is different and my use was pretty short-term, but after reading through so many posts here it is not horrible for everyone. 

I wish everyone the best of luck.",23

I have used benzos along with ritalin alcohol and marijuana for 10+ years along with some other antidepressants. First 2-3 years I have used 3-4 mg xanax and 5-6 liters of beer every day. After this period i decided to stop drinking, and went to see e psychiatrist. He put me on 4mg of clonazepam and 20 mg of escitalopram. Being an addict i decided to use marijuana along with my prescription for 2-3 years. I have researched online for a cure for my addiction and found some good stories about ibogaine helping with opiate addiction and thought it might help me kick my benzo + marijuana + escitalopram usage. Underestimating what benzo withdrawal is, and how hellish it can be, i started tapering off too fast, i quit my escitalopram and marijuana along with tapering down to get ready for my iboga ceremony. I thought i could quit 4 mg of clonazepam in 2 months, i started tapering 1 mg every week and after 4 weeks i was sober from all of my medication and drugs. It was really hard but the hell came after 1-2 weeks being sober from all of it. I lost a lot of weight, i slept for max 2 hours and some nights did not sleep at all. 3 weeks sober i became psychotic, i was convinced that if i dont kill myself somebody would kill my whole family because they were after me and i tried to kill myself. Fortunately the knife was dull and i survived, i did not seek professional help and decided to stay sober and go in Amsterdam for my iboga ceremony because i was convinced that once i take it all my addiction will be over and i would have a happy life. I took the iboga and had 0 effects, no visions, no stopping of my paranoia and delusions obviously and 0 benefit. I was still withdrawing from benzos and could not eat or do anything. I called my sister when i was in Amsterdam and she came from Germany, convinced me to seek help from a professional in Munich. I was convinced by then that i have schizofrenia. The doctor in Munich was very professional, she said that i suffer from depression and psychosis from benzo withdrawal and from not sleeping. She put me on antipsychotics and antidepressants. My delusions got better, I started to sleep but the withdrawals continued for months. After a couple of months i started using benzos again since nothing helped for my depression, this time i was using 8+ mg of clonazepam a day, and about 360 mg of ritalin (10x36mg concerta a day). After 4 years on this dose i decided to go in a detox center because i could not afford my medication. I started detoxing on june. They put me on some antidepressant+lamictal+antipsychotics and cut off my clonazepam from 8mg to 3mg. After 2 weeks being on that dose they lowered my clonazepam from 3mg to 2mg and 2 weeks later they cut my clonazepam and put me on 10mg of diazepam. I could not imagine to go any lower, and after 5 weeks being in detox i got out in early august. So in 5 weeks being in detox, i went from 8mg of clonazepam to 10mg of diazepam. 4 months later and i am still experiencing withdrawals and i could not lower any further. Currently i am taking 10mg of diazepam along with some other medications (lamictal+tolvon+reagila) and life is not good but it is better than being a full blown addict.",18

I jumped ~3 months ago and started my taper in January of this year. Throughout this entire process, I really haven’t felt like myself at all and have been rather depressed. I often (daily) dwell on the past and it just makes me sad. I have trouble trying to reassimilate back into the most simple social settings and just generally feel pretty hopeless. My friends all go out and are able to meet new people but I still feel anxious in these settings - so much to the point where I bottle up and don’t talk at all and it really bums me out. I miss feeling like myself.

I spoke to my doctor, and she had mentioned trying SSRI’s as this may be beneficial with my depression and also as a way to start feeling like my “old self” again. 

I’m tired of spinning my wheels and getting nowhere, but I also don’t want to become attached to a substance again and so I’m pretty worried. Has anyone here gone this route and could throw in their own two cents? Thanks all and I hope everyone here has been well.",2

It was hell trying to quit the benzos because they were the only thing in the short term helping me deal with my anxiety. The Prozac has helped immensely with those problems and was able to finally taper the benzos with only discomforts being cravings. Not having chest pains that made me feel like I was having a heart attack and sent me to the hospital on multiple occasions was a game changer. Since I’ve quit I’ve started going to college again and I have 2 B’s and an A, I left my cooking job at a shitty restaurant and I’m now a sales associate at BestBuy which is really improving my social skills.

To give some background - I am young (22M) and nearly died in 2019 due to a rare medical condition (had several heart attacks, 107 degree fevers out of nowhere - otherwise, I am perfectly healthy). I've also been psychologically abused by my family my entire life. It is likely that I suffer from PTSD as a result of both of these.

I've recently been prescribed a ""trial run"" of 0.5mg Xanax twice daily to help with issues related to anxiety and sleep. To be honest, it completely changed my life for the better - and I don't know if that is something that should concern me. It made me realize that over the last several years, I haven't had a single night of decent sleep. It also made me realize that I have been dealing with incredibly high levels of ""baseline"" anxiety outside of having completely disabling panic attacks. For the first time in my life, I feel normal. I can actually focus on things without intrusive thoughts. My mind isn't running at a million miles an hour. It's not like I experience some kind of high or sedative effects from the Xanax - I just feel normal, and that feeling is awesome.

I have been on five different antidepressants and been in and out of counseling for years to no avail. Benzos feels like the solution - so, my question is: is this a slippery slope? I feel like the benefits are amazing, but based on what I read on subreddits like this one, I feel like I should be worried. What is your opinion?

If anyone needs any more info, please let me know. I'm really trying to figure out how to best help myself and appreciate any feedback.

Edit: looks like this post has gained a lot of traction. Thank you so much for all of your responses. I think the best course of action will be for me to ask for prescriptions of limited quantities to use on an occasional basis. The medication has truly helped me, and I believe that using it sparingly will be a lifesaver at times",4

I’ve tried tapering and it hasn’t worked for me. I’ve even tried using another benzo such as Valium to come off of Xanax, but that hasn’t worked either. I just feel … awful. I feel like it’s the worst decision I’ve ever made and it effects every single thing I do. It makes my relationship unnecessarily hard. He’s very supportive and wants me to get treatment, but I’m scared to come off of it because I don’t know how I’ll be able to handle life. Everything is so bad. I want to do better for myself and everyone that I’m involved with, but I have finances and school and life in general to worry about. I know at the end of the day they’re just excuses though.

She gets it prescribed for anxiety at low, as needed doses, but within a week shes out and calling for refills.  Currently, she is prescribed 2mg clonazepam at bedtime, and up to 4 -1mg  xanax per day.  Of course this means she takes all 4, and then some everyday.  

my question, or advice i am seeking is how i can help her with her anxiety and depression while she is also fighting guilt and the compulsion to lie about her medications without getting angry or frustrated.  I will concede that she is taking as prescribed, but even if she is, its like shes in slow motion.  everything takes so long, her thoughts are scattered and she often trails off before finishing a sentence.  Normal tasks take longer, making the bed takes 45 minutes.  Its hard for me to not get frustrated and i feel like i am adding to her anxiety.  Simple things like signing into email or netflix takes her multiple tries.  I want to just grab her phone and do everything for her.  

as i said, i'll assume shes taking her meds as prescribed, and i understand there is a risk vs reward as far as alleviation of depression and anxiety with these meds.  how do i know when the side effects outweigh the relief shes getting from her pain?  moreover, how do i not treat her with impatience and frustration while shes going through this?

After the withdrawals are over I'm really considering switching to a low stable dose of Phenobarbital just to take the edge off the PAWS that are gonna last forever and take an occasional benzo on top because my anxiety is severe and it's the only way I could do exposure therapy. I don't want to live in a warzone for life. I'm agoraphobic anyways and am used to living in hell so I'm not worried about withdrawals in 10 years because then I will just switch to methadone and clonidine as mild NMDA-antagonists are neuroprotective from glutamate excitoxicity, clonidine helps my tics and according to wikipedia it should prevent olney's lesions.

To summarize the story briefly, I told a friend about my fear of using ativan. My friend could not understand this and asked why. I told her about the horror stories I read on the internet and said that they will happen to me too (I've only been using it for 1 month). When I told him that I was going to have an epileptic seizure, she laughed and looked at me strangely. She said she had never heard of such a thing in his life. I replied to her angrily, ""How would you know?"" She laughed and showed me the 1 mg Xanax pack that she had taken out of his pocket. Don't worry guys, the question that came to your mind also came to me and I asked her. I said, ""If you are still using it, then you cannot have lived Withdrawal."" She told me that she used 2mg xanax a day during the quarantine period (9 months) and quit it easily. Of course I never believed that. She told me that she only did the 6 weeks of tapering and then quit. I never believed it because what I read on the internet never matched what my friend was saying. I've been reading hundreds of horror stories on this subreddit and on benzobuddies for about 2 months, how could this be possible ? I was so obsessed with this and i asked to his boyfriend about reality of this story. The guy confirmed to me that she was taking 4 x 0.5mg xanax a day and does it every day for at least 8 months. I can't tell you how I felt at that moment. I kept saying to the girl, ""Don't lie, at least you've had a few symptoms, don't hide it."" The girl said she didn't even know that xanax caused such a withdrawal like this, she said that she only had trouble sleeping for a few nights but that’s all. I was shocked at that moment. According to the stories I read, there were people who used it for 2 weeks and had Withdrawal symptoms for 9 months. How could this happen? Then I thought of my father's wife. I remember my father said that his wife was taking xanax all the time and even drinking alcohol when it wasn't enough. He told me this about 5 years ago.

I immediately called my father and asked this question. Yes, my father was surprised too because he could not understand my questions. I was asking him if his wife had seizure from xanax withdrawal( maybe it's normal for him to be surprised lol). He told me that his wife did not take xanax for 3 months this summer and had any problem. So I asked how long she had been using it. And yes he answered… 7 years!! 

I didn't know what to say at that moment and of course I didn't believe my father either. Although I hate his wife, I said I wanted to talk to her and she confirmed it. She said that she quit xanax with only 2 months of tapering. My father and his wife did not understand meaning of my questions. He was like “WTF why she can’t quit it, what are you try to telling us?”  Then I started to explain him the legend of xanax(worse than heroin wd etc). This time, my father laughed. He told me that his wife quit xanax very easily and now she is highly functioning (Even his wife is a successful journalist lol)
 I was thoroughly confused, weren't those dark, painful stories true then? Was everyone fooling me? Finally, I went to the doctor's office for my doctor's appointment. I was looking for an answer to this question. While in the waiting room, I saw a box of ativan on the assistant's desk. I directly asked the question. Because this topic was killing me. The woman told me that she had been using ativan 2x 0.5mg every day for the past year and quit it easily. She even mentioned that she had a much harder time quitting the paxil. Although she was the assistant of the psychiatrist, she said that she had never witnessed any of these horror stories and stated that there were hundreds of patients for whom they were prescribed benzos. Moreover, most of them were able to quit without any problems! I was like WTF!!! My mind  was going to blow up Afterwards, the doctor called me in and I directly asked this question in my mind and talked about all these stories. He smiled at me in response and asked me if I had ever heard of the “nocebo effect”. Of course I didn't know. As I understand it, it's like placebo but not the effects of drug but the side effects of drug. My doctor said that as long as you believe, the brain will show all sorts of side effects. After thinking about it, I realized that there were dozens of people around me using xanax and none of them had terrible stories about xanax. Because in my country there is no website like benzobuddies or reddit where we have horrible stories about benzo WD.


I was enlightened at that moment. I realized that 90% of benzo withdrawal (especially anxiety and depression) symptoms are the nocebo effect. All these people I mentioned are people who quit xanax easily, and none of them shared their stories on the internet. Because these are people who do not know that xanax can cause such a WD. On the contrary, the more horror stories you read, the harder the withdrawal period will be. In particular, your anxiety symptoms will be worst. As Ashton says, most withdrawal symptoms are simply due to fear of withdrawal(which come/from horror stories). And those who experience it will also share their horror stories, and as a result, a vicious circle will occur. And I think even most of the PAWD symptoms are the nocebo effect. For exemple people with short-term memory problems may be experiencing this nocebo effect. If they have memory problems for another reason (eg, anxiety disorder), they will attribute this to withdrawal.

I'm sure there are some of you who really go through hell, don't get mad at me. But I want you to stop and think. Stop reading horror stories, don't do what I did. Even though I've only been on ativan for 1 month, I'm experiencing ridiculous anxiety symptoms because I've read so many horror stories. Like my friend's example, I'm sure there are millions of examples out there and I'm pretty sure they don't know about benzobuddies. Many may not even know that xanax is causing such dangerous withdrawal symptoms. (Again, i am sorry for my awful English)",4

My drug of choice was heroin and I feel like one of the lucky ones having been clean 20 years now.

In my eyes addiction is addiction but I am aware benzos like alcohol can be dangerous to quit.

My question here though is why are doctors getting away with prescribing benzos long term, when it states clearly they are only meant to be prescribed short term.

Like a week or two short term.

Aren’t doctors letting people down leaving them on benzos for years?

Especially when I hear stories of people being treat like junkies and told no more prescriptions… when it was the doctor who created the problem…

I don’t know but to me this looks like malpractice.

So why do you think they’re getting away with it.

This is happening in both the US and the U.K.

Surely any doctor leaving you on a tablet for years that’s only supposed to be taken for days is in the wrong.

It infuriates me being a recovering addict seeing so many struggling from a problem mainly caused by a doctor.

2021-11-18 13:36:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/qwwd2t/having_a_really_hard_time/,Having a really hard time,"Hey guys, once I got to 5 mg Valium I started to have a really hard time. Was able to drop by 1 mg every 2 weeks.. if I’d kept that up I would’ve been done by early December. Now even dropping by .5 mg sends me into full brown wd - severe anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations.. feels like I’m buzzing, crazy fatigue, brain fog, etc. Over the last month and a half I was able to get stable and slowly lower myself down to 5.5 but once I got to 5 mg again my body couldn’t take it so I have to go back to 5.5.

We discovered my nervous system is damaged from 10 years on klonopin and the effects I’m feeling is the effects of my body not being able to tolerate being off this drug. 

My doctor wants me to consider a medically induced detox to get off the Valium because at this rate I’m going down by .25 mg to tolerate the drops and even that is too much.  

I’m starting neurofeedback (insurance will cover) to help calm my nervous system down. I think this will be essential to get me sleeping better. It takes 10-20 sessions to feel a difference though. I recommend anyone who is tapering look into neurofeedback, it can play an essential role in making a full recovery.

So idk, I want to try to finish this taper by lowering by .25 mg even if it will take another 6 mo but my doc is concerned i may not be able to do it so medical detox may be my best bet plus it’s faster. The only reason she is advocating for this is because I tapered slowly and my dose is so slow I’m no longer at risk of seizure. Medical detox sounds really intense and I don’t want to do it though.

This really fucking sucks :(",8

It was literally what I thought to be a miracle pill.    WRONG.    From 18 to 27 years old I started taking Xanax as a way to be normal because I suffer from heavy Aspergers and social anxiety.  I could not have functioned without it.   Benzos allowed me to discover the person I am inside however it quickly became a crutch.

I would only become the version of myself I wanted when I was on a dose of benzodiazepines.


Started with 0.25mg 0.5mg occasionally and quickly was taking 2mg daily by age 21.  I then was heavily abusing and experimenting with cocaine and that just made everything 90000000x worse.  The cocaine addiction left me with debilitating anxiety up until age 26-27 which i really started accepting the help I needed.

I’ve been on this subreddit a lot and what scares me the most are seizures.   The threat and fear of seizures made me apprehensive to jumping off.


45 days ago I was taking 4mg daily of clonazepam because it was the only thing that worked anymore.   I quickly became in fear of life after being on 4mg daily for 30-45 days and in those days I had an epiphany.  I wanted off IMMEDIATELY.  I wanted my life BACK.


I dangerously tapered ultra fast down to 1mg daily and then to 0.5mg daily, every other day, then every 2 days, every 3 days, then COLD TURKEY OFF!!!

The withdrawals were ultra minimal in fact I don’t even remember withdrawing too bad.  I was also able to quit Kratom towards the end of it but I was also heavily using red Kratom during my withdrawal which not gonna lie, it helped.  

Everything I’ve read on this and other places told me that I would have a seizure but it is a miracle I did not.   Every day I would do yoga, meditation for minimum 20 minutes , breath work , and hard exercise.   It was because of my self care regimen and daily journaling that I was able to make it thru withdrawal with the armor of God!!!!

In the past couple months he's started using coke and opioids. He started working towards a degree in the fall, but he just failed out due to various benders and hardcore procrastination, and is now back home living with his parents. So he's at his lowest so far.

His buddy has also been screenshotting their text conversations and sending them to my fiance, involving some very dark messaging alluding to suicide. This isn't news, as it's known that he's struggling with depression and anxiety, and he's been going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist about it. Needless to say everyone is really worried.

Major problem is he's extremely stubborn. He flip flops between acting like he's totally in control and can get over it himself, then crying over the phone with his parents while vomiting from withdrawal. Parents are pushing him to join a 28-day rehab but he won't have it.

Any advice on how to reach him? I honestly don't know how to strike the right balance of being careful considering his teetering mental state, but also assertive enough to get him to take control. I've been so stuck in mental gridlock figuring out how/what to communicate to him that I've just been doing nothing.",1

I'm currently tapering for bromazepam use and i usually use prazepam. I checked all the equivalency tabs i could found and i noticed something weird. For every benzo the equivalence is compared with a dose of 10mg of diazepam. For example 0.5mg alprazolam = 5-6mg bromazepam = 10mg diazepam (Valium)
But for prazepam, i always see 10mg diazepam = 10-20mg prazepam. So wtf is that 10mg, 15mg, 20mg ? Because it makes a great difference. I usually take liquid prazepam but currently i only got valium cuz i need to get a new prescription. and i don't want to take too much diaz bc that would fuck with my taper.

I’m in a fucked up situation. Please note that none of these fucking doctors will do the Valium/diazepam taper. They don’t know what they’re doing.

I’m being treated for bipolar, generalized anxiety, BPD, ADHD. I was put on klonopin 0.5 3x a day 4 years ago. 

I have tried under a doctors supervision to taper. Each time it ended in disaster. I twitch, I feel sick, my bipolar gets worse, I become suicidal. Last time I was hospitalized and put back on klonopin and had my other meds adjusted. I felt fine after that. 

I recently moved, my previous doctor isn’t allowed to treat me in the county I live in so I have to find a new provider. Note, I’m symptomatic. My bipolar has been bad.

I saw a new doctor yesterday. She refused to keep me on klonopin, and wants to take me from 3x a day to 2x a day and go from there. 

From experience, that is extremely aggressive. I told her no, please at least get me stable first and then let’s taper. She didn’t listen.

I’m fucked. I don’t know what to do. Fuck this drug. I don’t know if I should keep looking for a doctor who will keep me on it or suffer and wait everything out.

She said if the taper gets that bad, to go to the psych ward to detox. I don’t know what to do. 

My primary care doctor, who I really like, said she will bridge me until I find a new doctor, so I just left a message for her on what I should do.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I stay on it? Suffer through the withdrawal and maybe go to the hospital? I feel fucked. 

What if I need it in order to treat my mental health symptoms ?

PLEASE don’t recommend other supplements, weed, CBD, etc. none of that shit works for me.",8

So I’ve had addiction to other substances, and have taken (prescribed) suboxone for opiate dependence for over 5 years. I was doing well, moving from an initial 32mg, down to 12mg, with the hopes to be clean by this time next year.

Then the last 12 months hit me light a freight train; not just the pandemic, the loss of a job, the start of a new one but in a much lower position than I’d hoped (but it’s a job, which is more than others have, right?), and then I find out I have MS. My world gets turned upside down. I knew I had adhd, and it felt like I was getting worse cognitively, but then the physical symptoms started, and it ultimately led to a diagnosis.

I got to keep my job, but my hours drastically reduced and any management position is no longer within reach. I’m now immunocompromised during a pandemic thanks to the treatment for MS, and I’ve been avoiding my latest MRI for so many reasons. 

The anxiety grows…it grows to the point where I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I write letters to my loved ones because I have so many physical sensations that make me feel like death is on the horizon. My psychiatrist tried me on many different antidepressants, and even antipsychotics, but the side effects are intense..some even causing more intense muscle spasms and inability to function. I become agoraphobic. Every waking moment I’m paralysed with the fear of death or seizure, fearing it will happen in front of my 9 yr old, who would not cope..she has learning difficulties.

My psychiatrist tells me she doesn’t like this, but our only solution is benzos, and I’m prescribed two 5mg diazepam a day, and .5 Xanax for panic attacks. In my country these drugs are heavily controlled…now I see why. 

Day one and I take the prescribed dose of diazepam and feel somewhat better. Work is about to start and the panic is so bad I want to vomit and can barely stand properly, I take the Xanax…and feel it’s not working properly, so take another half. I find out later I didn’t give it long enough, but the relief I felt was something I had not experienced in MONTHS. For almost a year I was a ball of fear, and this changed everything.

Day 2 and I take it all again…but with a little extra because I like feeling relaxed, it hasn’t happened in so long, and I need this, right? 

It’s now been 10 days and I’m taking way more each day than I should, and I’m scared when I run out, I’m back to the fear of seizures. I tell myself each day I will reduce, but I do the opposite. But I need to reduce, I have to.

I understand it’s early days for me, but I know from experience with the opiates how quickly this will turn into a nightmare. 

Today I’ve had 2mg Xanax, 30mg diazapam…and need to know if it’s safe to just stop. To stop taking anymore, and with it being this early, it should give me any adverse affects, right? 

Do I try and lower it to one diazepam a day and zero Xanax? I don’t know what to do. No one knows, I cannot tell anyone. But I also can’t go back to living the way I was; not sleeping because I was scared I wouldn’t wake up. Not being able to drive without pulling over every 5 minutes to make sure I wasn’t passing out. 

I come from a long line of addicts, and I guess I wasn’t lucky enough to avoid it. Can an addict take these medications safely? Can an addict stick to the prescribed dose? I’ve tried meditating, I’ve tried cbt and it doesn’t work. I’ve considered trying medical marijuana, but the process is a lengthy and difficult one to be approved here…but will I end up in the same position anyway? 

Sorry, I just don’t know who to ask, or what to do. I just want to relax without guilt. I want to be free of fear, and free of addiction, but I’m not sure I’m able to have both. What I need is a lockbox…a lockbox that will only give me the passcode to the correct amount of medication at the correct times of the day…there’s something for anyone more clever and technical than I to create. Willpower doesn’t seem to exist in my world.

Any and all advice welcome.",1

But then I remembered there are people browsing this sub *right now* looking for help.

I was on 2g of Phenibut and ~ 4-6mg xanax (equivalency) for 2 years. I say equivalency because it wasn’t xanax, it was RC benzos but I’m just using alprazolam as a reference. At first it was etizolam, then several others, until these past couple months where I was on 2mg flualprazolam.

I’ve gone through both benzo and Phenibut withdrawal (separately) and they were both hell in their own separate ways.

Well. I’m currently 10 days off of Phenibut and 4 days off of benzos. Because I checked myself into a psych hospital. Not for detox really, but because my occasional suicidal thoughts had turned to constant suicidal intentions.

When I was in the hospital, I figured I’d start up the keto diet again. They were doing the cooking so I could have as much eggs, sausage, and chicken as I wanted.

In the hospital, they tapered me on ativan over 5 days. Starting at 4mg/day and ending at 0.5mg.

I’m now 10 days free from Phenibut and 4 days free from benzos. Either withdrawal alone would have me losing my fucking mind but I feel quite good.

In fact my depression has almost entirely cleared up.

I have tons of energy and I’ve turned into somewhat of a social butterfly.

I have had a few panic attacks but it’s nothing unmanageable.

I could go into the science of *why* the ketogenic diet would help with WD (the keto diet alters brain function in many different ways), but it’s very late and I should be going to bed.

(20m),"I'm currently going through fent withdrawal, used it for maybe 5 months and I've been using benzos daily for well over a year as well as weaker opioids like trams and stuff like that. the real reasoning behind it might sound corny but at the time I didn't care about getting addicted to these substances, I was in a really bad place mentally and I'm still fighting my way out of there.

back when I started doing drugs in high school I genuinely believed I wouldn't make it to 20, or at least I secretly hoped I wouldn't make it to 20. I was planning to die from the start. then when I graduate high school I take a full year off just to work a few shifts to make my car payments and do drugs. so when I finally go to college I took it serious for the first week or so, and then I just started showing up to class high as fuck.

I still passed all my classes but looking back on it I realize how much of a fucking loser I was and I'm trying to break free of that mindset and become something better. this year, of being 20 years old has been the worst year of my life by a landslide due to a health condition plus the fent 30s I was sniffing now every day and doing some benzo every day along with it. 

I'm going back to school next semester and going to the doctor to let them know I want to taper (my doctor knows about my benzo use) and also going to a specialist that my doctor has referred me to but my lazy barred out ass can't be bothered to fix my own health, I'm just letting myself slowly die basically and I've ignored it up until a few days ago. 

I'm a complete fucking idiot and totally responsible for the situation I'm in with the drugs. right now, I live in constant agony and numb myself to it every day, I consider myself a pretty intelligent person and I'm trying hard to accept that I might be broken. but I have a burning desire inside me to repair the pieces, and I have absolute confidence in myself that I can push through any physical ailments if I get my mind right and fully pursue the many passions and hobbies I had before the drugs.

I've never wanted anything so bad in my life.",7

I'm still tapering and fortunately have found the root causes behind my prescribed benzo precriptions. No Western doctor did that for me. I knew that it was early menopause symptoms but my symptoms were pathologized/ gaslighted by doctors over and over again along my 18 year journey with Harmaceutical drugs.

What strikes me most in my benzo support groups is the massive amount of people who have been prescribed so many Harmaceutical poisons for a myriad of reasons. Others, have found these poisons on the streets or through friends.

The question is: What are the true reasons for benzo use?

It seems to me that far too many people are being told, or led to believe, that whatever stress they are feeling is only THEIR problem. It's not the society that they live in, not the job, not the family, not the environment in which they live, not the trauma of living in a sick society. 
It's only THEM.

Pathologized to the limits, we take the drugs.
Gaslighted into believing that it's only our problem, we take the drugs.
Finger-pointing and guilting and being singled out in a vulnerable state and on and on, we take the drugs.

And for what?

Are you anxious? What is causing anxiety?

The bottom line: I refuse to believe that the millions and millions of people around the world are being placed on Harmaceutical poisons for the good of their health.
I refuse to believe that doctors know what they're doing regarding benzos.
I refuse to believe that millions of people around the world are truly ill.


I believe that each and every one of us is struggling now more than ever.
I believe that this brainwashing and drugging needs to stop.

I believe that Big Harma are psychopaths that need a taste of their own ""medicine"".

I believe that there is a serious problem with how we are conditioned. Those of us who know there is definitely something wrong with the way we are forced to live life plays a hand in this whole shit show.

TLDR: In my experience, licensed drug dealers a.k.a doctors know diddly smack about prescribed drugs and simply brainwash people into thinking they have some bullshit ""mental illness"" when it just may be the state of a world, run by psychopaths, who prefer to drug rather than heal.",7

Right now I am becoming extremely worried and depressed about my cognitive ability. I feel like I can’t think which causes me many issues including: socializing (can’t really hold a conversation), learning/memory (had to drop out of school because I can’t function well enough to keep up with work). I’m just so awkward now when talking to people because I have no idea what to talk about or what to say. I haven’t seen any improvement in this area and it is really troubling. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience. Thanks.",3

First it was Ativan, then Klonopin. I was taking them daily, again, and at one point for about one month I was taking 1mg everyday. At the end of August I began tapering and have been off completely since October 25th. Overall all I was probably averaging 0.5mg-0.750mg a day.

Today is now day 21 of being benzo free and I am still feeling very...off. The WDs are not excruciating. I am not feeling any physical pain or akathisia like some people on here. Mentally however I am doing very poorly. I am constantly dissociated, depressed and anxious. More so dissociated and depressed than anxious, oddly enough. I was on Adderall/Vyvanse for a long time and have had to stop that since coming off the Klonopin so I am wondering if that has anything to do with it. I am not sure when I will be ready to go back on the ADHD meds since ever since I began tapering whenever I would take them I would get completely tweaked out. My tolerance was reversed.

Overall my main concern is how off I am still feeling despite being on a relatively low-medium dose for a small period of time. Nothing compared to some of the people who have been on 3mg of Klonopin daily for over a decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I kind of feel like I am going crazy. I've been feeling this way ever since I began tapering.",1

Just need a breath of fresh air but can't get there.,"31 year old male here. First off, I did this to myself. I screwed up and accept that. My wife has been amazing helping me through this and idk where I would be without her.

About a month and a week ago I stopped taking clonazepam. I was taking it almost daily for 4 months. Anywhere between .5 and 2+ mgs a day. Irresponsibly. I had some acute withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks. It was terrible as im sure you all know. Extreme anxiety. I was crying before and at work every day until finally about two weeks in the symptoms started to reside.

Then, about 1 week later I decide to take alprazolam / Valium in conjunction with oxycodone almost daily for two weeks. The oxy was between 20 and 40mgs a day, snorting the majority of it. The alprazolam was between 1 and 2 mgs a day, Valium was anywhere between 20 and 40mgs a day.

This is where the shit hits the fan, but in a good way. I reached out to my parents and siblings saying I needed help. My dad convinced me to go to detox. My last day using was Friday, November 5th. I went into the detox program on Monday the 8th and got discharged on Thursday the 11th.

I take 10mgs of escitalopram daily and have for about 4 months now. The hospital has me on 300mg gabapentin and 10mg propranolol three times a day, daily as needed. This definitely helps, but im still getting elevated anxiety almost daily. Its very apparent when I get to work and throughout the day at work. 

I just need a breath of fresh air. Everytime I think the symptoms are good, I wake up with anxiety or it comes out of nowhere and drags me back down. Im struggling to get through work. My boss quit last week so my workload is almost two fold now to top it all off. Will these withdrawal symptoms compound with my previous use of clonazepam? I'm hoping it takes 2-3 weeks to reside since I only used these for 2 weeks on the nose. How long can I go taking gabapentin before I become somewhat dependant on that and need to ween off?

Any insight or thoughts on the above are much appreciated. Just struggling a bit right now.",1

I told my doctor I wanted to get off this terrible crap and he switched me right away to 18mg Diazepam. I’ve been cutting monthly and am down to 12.5/day now. 

A couple of things I’ve been noticing…I don’t even notice the change in dosage on the monthly drop - that’s been nice and can only hope it continues. 

I also feel less anxious and seriously think that the clonazepam was the root cause of my anxiety for a number of years now. 

The only negative I’ve noticed is that I feel much more impulsive now and have been drinking and using other recreational drugs more often. In the past drinking/drug use would give me pretty serious anxiety the next day which was a great deterrent, but it hasn’t been lately.

I feel way more sharper mentally. I can form sentences with ease and when I’m feeling good, I love talking to people. Before I could barely form a sentence.

The WD symptoms do come in waves though. Hour long boughts where I have terrible tremors and sweating through every pour in my body.

It was just keeping WDs at bay.

Is my brain damaged?,"I don't see this symptom reported too much and I am starting to feel not only lonely but also a lot frustrated as I can't pinpoint why I feel this.

It's basically a feeling of burning as if some nerves of the right temple of my head were in flames, like a processor overheating. What triggers this feeling is using the celphone too much, screens or anything with too much stimuli: even a board game I tried with my friends days ago made me feel this. Lack of sleep and getting hungry seems to make easier to get into this state.

It's debilitating: once I enter this state, I need to eat some rice (it seems to help), take a nap, stop everything and do nothing and stuff that doesn't demand any rational effort. Intelectual efforts trigger this, creative efforts don't.

I am barely working well at my job. Everything feels like too much and I have to take long pauses. Any rational effort for some time feels like I endured days of hard effort on my brain doing some math and managing a lot of stuff. If I insist ignoring the sensation the symptoms get really bad. Online meetings/dynamics feels like a torture.

I am also at 225mg of pregabalin which seems to help... actually 300+ dosages were enough to make this much much manageable but pregabalin is another drug to taper so I am considering quitting it. This symptom started as I finished my cross taper from alprazolam to diazepam and this was more than a year ago.

Does anyone here have this? Does anyone have any lead about why this particular symptom occur?",4

How to get off this help please,"So after i figured out how easy it is to get benzos in tijuana, (i live around a 4 hour one way drive from the border in california) i decided to prescribe myself farmapram. I was taking 40-44mg of alprazolam a day. My first day taking them was the 26th of july. So its been roughly 3 months since ive been on 40-44mg of alprazolam a day. I would just like the ability to escape real life, i liked living in the other reality of being on benzos. I cant even recount the number of drives ive taken down there and not to mention idk what would happen if i got caught i would always cross back with at least 5 bottles of 90x 2mg alprazolam (farmaprams) straight out of tijuana roma pharmacies so they were definitely real. I tried quitting around a month ago but the withdrawal was so unreal like my mind was still in that benzo reality while i tried to return to normal however now feeling all this anxiety and fear, so i got back on after about a week. I now want to quit, and its been around 5 days since my last dose. Those last few days on, i was on some pressed Adderall though that i obtained from a guy i know who gets his drugs from the darknet. They are definitely not legit but made me feel good (dealer said he tested to make sure they weren't meth and said they only tested positively for amphetamines but he couldve been lying of course) and only took 30mg of alprazolam in the the afternoon plus some sleeping medicine Nyquil in order to sleep. That's when i realized again i had a problem, on those drives home id think ""dang im so high right now that i don't care if that was meth"". I haven't taken them since but now im definetly feeling the withdrawals and ive think ive become physically dependent on them as im having these muscle twitches, im experiencing nausea,  im dizzy and i just feel completely dissociated from reality with a lot of anxiety and fear. I feel as if i have to take at least 2mg today. This isnt a success story yet and know it probably isnt as exciting to read about as a success story, but id appreciate some advice from you all. I keep wondering if this if cold turkey is the best route, probably not, but im so sick of this addiction i just want out as quickly as i can. What im most worried about is if stopping cold turkey could cause some permanent damage (even though i know my insanely high dose was more damaging). I already know this isnt safe and i should be asking my doctor",2

I do get a prescription for Klonopin, but not nearly enough to taper off of clonazolam.

The best way I can think of going about this is to lower my clonazolam intake very slowly, and then finally making the jump over to klonopin. What are your guys's thoughts for ideas on this particular situation? Any comment helps, thank you",5

mid july i got an Rx of ativan 1mg 15 tablets that i took over the course of 2 months every few days or so.

in mid september i got a script for klonopin and was taking 1mg on average every 3-4 days.

i didn't realize i became dependent cause i never took it two days in a row. but when i stopped taking it cold turkey, i had panic and tremors.

so basically on lower dose benzos for 4 months taking them every 3-4 days.

my question is would it be better to switch to daily dosing and taper from there, or keep the every 3-4 days and taper the dose there?

So, just a quick description: I have been recovering from long term use of
Diazepam for a a few months. I went gradually from 30mg a day to 5mg a day using that table provided by the Professor Ashton’s website. 
I was doing everything by the book, however, I didn’t calculate my supply properly and run out of diazepam teo days ago and I am now going CT and worried.
I do have other benzos available (that I’ve tried briefly a year ago) to keep me going until I obtain a new script for Diazepam so I can carry on with the cleaning process. They are just not the best ones for a detox, if I understood the manual correctly.
My question is: would it still be better if I took the equivalente dose of Diazepam but with another benzo? If so, which one would be best? Lorazepam or Clonazepam?

I binged hard in July. 20 xanax, 15 valium, 30 zoplicone in about 10 days. I know its a short period of time, but its a lot of stuff in a short span. A couple of days, and I had the worst anxiety attack on my life. Went to hospital, thought I was dying. Started SSRI. felt awful for days but started getting better, then bang, another huge anxiety attack. I felt unimaginably awful. It was hell. This stuck through all of August basically.

I had a few days that were slightly better and I'd usually get a decent window in the evenings. But id sleep broken, wake up anxious and depressed at 7am, dry heave, muscles twitching, zero appetite, just total misery. Every day took 100 hours it felt. By 8am I could start eating and enjoying a movie or something. I didn't realise it was benzo wd, I thought it was ssri side effects.

10th of September I woke up 4am, rang the crisis team, and they told me I was medication seeking. I wasnt-I got my drugs illegally to begin with, if I wanted to them I could have had them. Anyway I felt so awful I was like 'I will show you' and tried to throw myself in front of cars, tried to sit in the middle of the road. I couldn't do it though.

From the day after I started to feel more determined and positive generally. I still had some bad days, but started having much better ones. The contrast certainly made things better. Had some waves too, but from 28th Sept until October 24th I had a great window. Was a bit mentally fragile and anxiety prone, but basically normal. Was able to do things as normal, with just a smidge more anxiety, which is to be expected given I was a bit anxiety prone anyway and I'm still on a low dose of ssri.

Anyway, I had a two week wave from 24th Oct, got better 5th November and though I feel apprehensive and scared of the return of symptoms, I'm feeling optimistic that the windows are starting to become my dominant state.

I know this isn't quite a success story, but for those of you still in your earliest days it can hopefully give you some hope that things can sometimes turn around fast",3

I am now also prescribed gabapentin and trying to get off of it or at least to a lower dose than where I’m at now but it scares me so much to taper considering I live alone and I think I’ve developed a really severe panic disorder from this drug. My anxiety is so bad lately and I can’t help getting insanely paranoid when I do taper even though I’ve only tapered by .5 once. I’m so afraid to go down another .5… does it seem to be safe to be doing this and going down by .5? I’m really afraid of getting a seizure. Any tips/advice? :(,1

I started off at .5mg twice a day. Then I got up to 2mg a day then finally 3mg a day for GAD and panic attacks. I mentioned to my doctor that I wanted to start taking a smaller amount. I went from 3mg to 2mg and now I’m at 1mg everyday (This has been over the course of 7 months). Now he wants me to only take as needed. I get a prescription every 3 months with three refills. When he said take as needed he gave me 15 days worth of .5mg twice a day for a month and 3 refills. I called them the next day and said I think I still need it everyday and he called me into his office and kind of gave me a lecture, but gave me a 3 month supply of .5 twice a day everyday. I see him next month for a prescription refill. I want to try to take as needed which means he will only give me a 15 day supply of .5 twice a day. I am thinking about asking him for 1mg once a day as needed instead. Then work my way down to 10 a month.  I don’t think I can ever get off of it completely, but having it for emergencies only will be okay I think. I tested myself by not taking any Clonazepam for the last 5 days and I have had no withdraws. And my anxiety is fine, but it feels good to know that I have some just in case.

Some background info: I've been on Xanax 2mg/day for the past 3 weeks or so (in combination with lots of other substances). Kind of an irresponsible decision since I don't really need it and didn't inform myself prior to using but yeah it is what it is and now I need to deal with the consequences. 

I've been informing myself a lot about the topic and most people suggest doing a taper instead of doing cold turkey due to the risk of seizuring or portraying it as life-threatening and such.

I guess I w-ve've been wondering how I should go about the taper; as in, how much less I should take each week/how often etc. Not expecting an exact plan/schedule but if anyone would have the time for that I would truly appreciate it.

My parents are suggesting to go to rehab where they would take care of me but in my mind, this is not an option right now (last time backfired) and I would like to do this on my own. 

I know I can handle it, I have been through much worse (no need to go through details) but this is the first time I find myself in such a situation so I honestly could use just about any advice/experience. 

Also wondered how long it would take for my life to go back to normal; as in, how long the withdrawals would last for and such.

Thank you for reading this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1

I have been on lorazepam for a while. Since early August I have been taking it pretty much everyday. With doses ranging from 1mg - 3mg daily.

I calculated that over the last month I took 2.25mg a day on average. The month before that I was on approx. 1.8mg a day. Is this 0.75mg cut really causing withdrawals?

I have actually withdrawn from Diazepam before, I was on a much higher dose though, taking around 40mg a night for roughly a year, I did go cold turkey, although looking back that was not a great idea, it made me extremely sick, I couldn't function, but after around 4 weeks the symptoms eased and I started sleeping again, and after around 3 months, I felt my self again.

So this time I have been taking Diazepam for around 4 years now, starting again around 2 years after I stopped the previous time. I have only ever taken relatively small dosage during this period. I started on 10mg and never went above this, over the last year I have managed to get down to around 2.5mg by cutting a 5mg tablet in half, however I cannot seem to taper off lower than this. As soon as I drop to 2mg, I get symptoms. I am seeking help, and they have advised just to stop as 2.5mg won't be enough to cause any life threatening symptoms. I haven't taken any for the last 2 nights, the first night was fine, slept well. Last night was like hell, tossing and turning, sweating and an extremely dry mouth. They also recommended using Amitriptyline, which I have taken before, as a substitute to help me sleep, but it seems counter productive to me to swap out one drug for another.

So the question is, should I just try and taper, or am I at a low enough dose now to just completely stop taking the Diazepam? And should I try the Amitriptyline or just put up with the lack of sleep? The main thing for me is the sleep issues, I only really get mild anxiety and no depression. Any help would be much appreciated.",2

TLDR-Anti Acids gave me intrusive anxiety. I was getting better after stopping, but then took my xanax, and adhd meds, and the anxiety returned a couple days later. Could it be one of the meds I took that caused me to go backwards?


So I'm not really active on this sub, but I thought people here would be of some help. 

To make a really long story short, early this summer I started having pain in my stomach that was diagnosed as gastritis. The anti acid I was prescribed caused really bad anxiety. Thankfully I had a xanax prescription as I have GAD. I didn't realize at the time the the anti acid was causing the anxiety, and thought it was just because of the stomach issues causing anxiety/depression. 

As time went on, the anxiety and depression continues to get more severe, to the point where I started having intrusive thoughts. 

During this time, because of my anxiety...I didnt want to even take my xanax(funny how that works)

I realized it was the anti acid, and stopped taking it. It took a few of weeks but I got to a point where I felt back to normal for about a week straight. For a couple of days I took my xanax at night to get a good night sleep, and I also took 1/4 of my adderall a couple days in a row(which I had also stopped for a while). 

Well a couple of days after that, out of NOWHERE, the anxiety and intrusive thoughts just hit me randomly, and its been about couple months and it hasnt let up since. Because I was doing so well and thought I was just going back to my normal self, this was really unexpected...I was thinking that maybe the xanax or adderall threw me back out of balance or something. I havent taken either since, but have considered taking half a xanax(.5mg) to try and cope. I dont want to do this if this is just going to prolong the healing process. I’m not wanting to see a dr, because they will just push an antidepressant on me, which is actually what caused my anxiety years ago. I also never needed it before the anti acids. 

Any input would be great!

I need your advice!

I'm in benzodiazepine withdrawal for 3 years.

I started at 40mg vallium, went down to 25mg in 6 months.

Then I changed molecule and I switched to Prazepam, for a very short time but I still went down to 20mg (equivalent +- to 15mg of vallium)

I've been on clorazepate (Tranxilium) for almost 2 years now. I was at 10mg this summer (about equivalent to 7,5mg of Vallium) but I had a serious accident on my motorcycle and I had to increase the doses to 15mg because I couldn't have my routine anymore which helped me to wean myself...

But even with the increase, it didn't help me. I don't feel like increasing more yet.

I wanted to know, if I switch back to Vallium, could it be beneficial to me after more than two years of stopping? (Knowing that I used it for 6 months, I had stopped it because I had a paradoxical reaction at the end, but I was at ""high"" doses at that time) 

Or will I just not feel anything anymore? Each time I switched molecules, it helped me to lower my doses quickly because it relieved me immediately. 

It would also be better for me because the drops are much easier to wean off, my microbalance is not the best.

2021-11-08 21:56:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/qpu5hj/success_story_from_an_8_year_klonopin_user_that/,Success story from an 8 year Klonopin user that finally quit,"I felt it was important to hop back on this subreddit after an 8 month hiatus during which I was withdrawing from an 8 year addiction to Klonopin.

For some back story, I was on Ativan for about 2 years (1mg/night) then switched to Klonopin (1mg/night) and was on that for 6 years. The last 2 years I was on about 1.5mg/night. I always had bad anxiety but made sure to limit my usage to nighttime. I suffer from depression and bad insomnia, that eventually got so bad I developed an anxiety disorder and my psych prescribed me Ativan because absolutely nothing else would put me to sleep. We tried all sorts of safer meds to try and fix the underlying issues but the depression just kept getting worse and worse. After several years, it was clear that the benzos were doing more harm than good and realized that as long as I was on them, it was unlikely I'd ever kick the depression, and was likely even preventing the antidepressants from working properly.

My psych ran out of options as we had tried just about every antidepressant out there, so he threw the kitchen sink at it and prescribed me Zyprexa. It's an antipsychotic, which was a really bad idea in hindsight. Never take an antipsychotic unless you are clearly and professionally diagnosed bi-polar or are suicidal and absolutely nothing else has worked. I can't blame my psych for trying to help but take my advice and don't do it unless you are completely out of options. So anyways, the Zyprexa worked magically for my sleep for about a month then stopped working almost completely. Also, my motivation tanked hard and I couldn't even sit and work for more than 20 minutes at a computer before needing to just lie down. It was bad. Mind you, I was also on the Klonopin still, so my brain was getting hit pretty hard every single night even though the Klonopin was becoming a sugar pill for me and only the Zyprexa was really having any noticeable affects but was wildly inconsistent... If I took it a few days in a row, it would become less and less effective, but if I didn't take it at all, I just wouldn't sleep. So I'd reduce my dose for a few days then take a higher dose after 4 days and finally get a decent night of sleep, but even that wasn't consistent. I was a wreck. Tired all the time, completely exhausted from lack of sleep, deeply depressed, super anxious, nauseous all the time, stomach problems, had trouble eating... I knew if I didn't kick these meds I was assuredly going to kill myself going on this same track.

So this is it. It was around the middle of March. I spent weeks slowly titrating the Zyprexa and Klonopin in tandem. I knew it was dangerous to withdraw from both at the same time so I got off the Klonopin first and then the Zyprexa several weeks later. I had no choice, I simply was no longer getting any kind of benefit from either of these drugs so I just need to stop taking them and bite the bullet. It was going to be intensely uncomfortable but I just had to do it because every time I tried before it never worked and I would always go back on because the anxiety and insomnia would get way too intense after several weeks. What followed was probably the closest thing I could imagine Hell being like on this Earth. Intense depression, dissociation, anxiety, nausea, stomach issues, muscle twitching and soreness, insomnia, and the worst thing of all: akathisia.

I had read about akathisia many times before but finally knew, first-hand now. A deep inner restlessness and anxiety that never stops no matter what you do. If I tried to lie down and relax, I felt like I needed to stand up and move around. If I stood up or moved around oh, I felt like I needed to lie down and relax. It really is the most horrific feeling you can imagine and it's far beyond normal anxiety.

All of these symptoms went on for about a month-and-a-half. I have been living with my parents for the last 2 and 1/2 years after failing to hold down a job despite my best efforts. I was able to cope and scrape on by for many years but I finally had to move back in with them if I had any hope of getting off these medications and healing without the stress of a day job and bills. I timed this so the worst would be hitting me when my parents were going out of town for a 3-month vacation. Weirdly my anxiety never made me feel like I needed to be around people, it just made me feels a little better being alone and not burdening other people with my problems.

Anyways I tried to at least go for walks or low energy bike rides just to get out of the house and be in nature because obviously lying around all day wasn't going to help. I'd often put on podcast or chill YouTube videos about video games while going for walks and bike rides. I am a programmer and was playing Stardew Valley at the time and decided I should build a calculations app for the game just to give me something to keep me busy during the day. Life was awful but everyday was getting just a little bit easier, ever so slightly after that first month and 1/2 of utter Hell.

It's November now and it's now about 8 months since stopping the Zyprexa and Klonopin. I can't really say exactly when the anxiety completely stopped but I did notice about a month ago that I had no anxiety anymore at all. I still have sleep issues and depression but these things predated the anxiety and initial panic attacks that exacerbated all of these things. Now I can continue trying to focus on the depression but feel better knowing that I have a better chance of an antidepressant working should I need to go back down that route. 

I'm here to let people know that it does get better. I had tried so many times to slowly, carefully, and responsibly get off the benzos but my awful sleep issues and anxiety always caused me to cave in after several weeks of my last dose. I just want people to know my story so they have some hope that they can and will get through this. It's incredibly hard but you can do it and once you do it you realize that nothing can stop you. It really is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with and I can't imagine experiencing anything else in my life that will come close but that's made this victory even sweeter. It's just crazy to me that the constant anxiety, nausea, and stomach issues are finally gone. I should absolutely be dead but I'm not and I felt like I was going to kill myself for sure. You can do this. If I can withdrawal from a powerful antipsychotic and an eight-year Klonopin addiction, you can kick your benzo habit even if you've been on them for many years.

I love you all and I really appreciate the advice and help this subreddit has provided me along with other help forums online. After a few weeks I knew I just needed to stop researching and looking online because sometimes you can become paranoid reading other people's horrible experiences and thinking you are going to experience the same thing or feel like you're permanently damaged when you are not. You are not permanently damaged. You will recover. I truly thought I was going to die or go completely insane from the lack of sleep and exhaustion but I didn't. Trust me, I have severe insomnia and I am still alive and I'm able to program again and I'm picking up the pieces again one day at a time but I'm no longer actively thinking about ending my life, nor suffering from debilitating anxiety, which is a huge relief. Hopefully this can help someone else out and get them to pull through when it feels like the world is ending and there's no hope and that the pain will never stop. It will stop, it just takes time. For me, it took about 2 months to get through the worst, then it started getting easier and easier. Everyone is different but I was in a really bad place. Don't be afraid to ask for help and don't feel bad for needing to lean on others. We are only human and we need each other. Hang in there. It will get better. Trust me.

PS. Before people ask, I had tried several of the usual supplements like magnesium for sleep and relaxation, theanine, valerian root, passion flower, but I knew that my Gaba receptors where completely desensitized and down regulated from the Klonopin usage and heard that it would be hard for those receptors to recover as long as I was still hitting them with Gaba related supplements so I essentially did this all with no supplemental help. Yes it was awful and difficult but I made it through. Also I had gone to a point where literally nothing would help whatsoever and I mean nothing. It was a scary place to be in but I made it through.

PSS. People should REALLY be cognizant of their poor sleep hygiene and habits. Try to be off all electronics at least an hour before bed, but imo, people should really trying being off all electronics after sunset. Electronics give off blue light which suppresses melatonin production which hurts sleep. When your sleep sucks, everything sucks. I'm not convinced blue light glasses and blue light filters are enough. Even besides that, staring at your phone for hours a few inches from your face can mess with your vision and perception and social media sites are AWFUL for mental health, be it due to arguing over politics or getting into fights over silly things, or getting in a negative mental rut from looking at all your friends having kids and being successful when you feel like a piece of shit... consider deleting your social media accounts, but if not, at least don't use them before bed. I deleted my Facebook years ago and it did wonders for my anxiety (or at least was 1 less thing adding to my stress). Also, exercise. Doesn't have to be strenuous. Even just 30 minutes of walking a day is really good for you and exercise also helps your blood flow which aids in removing all the toxins from your body. I tried working out hard and that actually made me more anxious, so just find what works best for you, be it walking, bike riding, swimming, whatever. The thing is you won't notice a difference immediately when you improve your sleep hygiene. You have to do it every single day, consistently, for weeks and weeks before you notice a difference. It's hard as hell, too, because everything is online now and it can be uncomfortable sitting in silence or being alone with your thoughts but for many people, their dopamine receptors are burnt out, so many people need to force themselves to be kind of bored for awhile. I notice when I don't touch my video games for like 3 months, they're a lot more fun and engaging when I go back to them, which quickly peters out after about a week as I sort of can't stop myself from binging. All things to keep in mind.",21

I am currently at .75mg of Xanax a day. (.25mg 3x a day) 

I have been doing 10% cuts and holding for 2 weeks before cutting again + some weeks of holding longer or updosing, so it has been a slooooow process.

I’m tired of it though. I just want to rip the bandaid off and be done. I did the math and it looks like I won’t be at anywhere near a jumping point until April or May!! 

Also, I’m going on a weekend trip to Disney world in March and I will still be tapering by then. A plane phobia and flying to Colorado is what got me into this taper mess so I am terrified I’ll go back to square one. I want to figure out a game plan for that because I know I’ll need extra on that trip.  

I’m in my last year of college too, student teaching full time, and getting multiple endorsements for teacher certification, so I *really* have to be functional. 

I get scared and sike myself about about seizure potential and manic episodes of I cut too drastically. I feel like my fear of each cut keeps me from potentially making this process easier and faster.

Is there anyway to speed the process up and still be functional? If anyone has any experience or advice with tapering quicker or more drastically with manageable side effects, I’d love to hear about. I desperately need some support right now. If anyone feels up to DM, I would be very grateful 🤍

Have a lovely Sunday everyone",2

In the spring of 2020 my then psychiatrist ""tapered"" me off 15mg V per day to zero in 15 days, I now know this was a CT. I ended up inpatient in a psych ward. There I was put on 1mg K twice a day. That stabilized me within two days. In June this year, I had a total right knee replacement and was on high doses of opioids for about three weeks. After I was done with the pain meds started noticing some interdose benzo WD symptoms, by august I was in full-blown Tolerance WD and I started to taper, I'm now down to .5 mg per day. My next cut is supposed to be down to .375 per day for a month then .25 for a month then .125 for a month then jump off. My doses give absolutely no relief from WD symptoms and usually actually make things worse. I have been told this taper is too much too fast but I just can't see dragging it out if I'm getting no relief from doses and they actually make things worse when I take them. Has anybody else actually done a similar K taper and had it work out ok?",3

This k taper is literally killing me, I’ve lost too much weight and cannot eat unless I’m taking a daily piece of my .6mg allocation - and then barely - my GI and central nervous systems go agonizingly haywire. Also having heart problems associated with the stress of taper. Dr is very concerned with weight loss and possible resulting infection/pneumonia. He’s ordered a full body CT scan for other possible sources of the loss, severe migraines, body weakness, debilitating physiological anxiety, etc. He’s not involved with the taper, isn’t the prescriber but also doesn’t think that’s the cause. I think these tests will turn out like the blood labs and other tests with nothing serious but we’ll see. My bet is this is 99.9% from benzo tolerance withdrawal.

Options as we know are limited and not good. If i up-dose I’ll probably never get off the poison. If I don’t I’ll be in hospital soon suffering WD and maybe a feeding tube. There are other darker options which I don’t wish to contemplate.

Dunno why I’m posting I guess other than maybe somebody else has been in these similar shoes & offer words of advice.",9

I push around an office chair most of the night until around 1 am. But I still don’t feel safe laying down to go to sleep until around 3 am or after. Whenever I try to sleep before that I jolt up in bed and have bad panic attacks. I’ve been told I have akathisia on this thread before but shouldn’t it be going away if I am still on the medicine and taking more? I’m absolutely terrified of being alone now even during the day. I pay my little brother to stay with me at night. I wake up hungover every morning around noon and just cry all fucking day and feel numb to the world. I’m so afraid now that the clock is turning back another hour tonight. I have been doing this routine since July and I feel like I’ve lost my mind at this point. The only time I feel ok is around 6-7 hours after I dose until I go to sleep. I do still shit in grocery bags most nights and pee on the floor. 😭not proud of myself at all.,4

Something that has really been bothering me is the fact that I was taking 3, 0.5 clonazepam a day, for over 4 months. My “ taper” was then being prescribed 1 a day for 1 week and then after that I was cut off. I didn’t realize at the time that this was a huge part of why I had a nervous breakdown until months later. Just as I was taken off the medicine, I went through some horrible things, and literally had a nervous breakdown that I’m still recovering from. ( March is when I cracked) Now is it just me, or was it cruel for my doctor to stop the medicine so abruptly like that. Is one week of taking it once a day, then it being stopped the normal? I know it’s in the past now, but I don’t feel I’m the same. I didn’t realize how helpful the medicine was until I didn’t have it anymore. I was in full blown panic mode for months. Cried screamed hysterically all day, didn’t sleep, didn’t eat all while trying to take care of a small child and going through extreme mental abuse. It was the worst I had ever felt. I would wake up and have full blown panic attacks I was a disaster. Sorry for the rant and I don’t exactly know what I’m getting at, I just feel like it was in humane to stop clonazepam like that. I’m angry. I’m so angry that just as things were getting bad my doctor would stop it while I was trying to parent. I was desperate to get it back but he said no.

Started on 40 mg diazepam in mid august. Tuesday I jumped from 30 to 25 mg diazepam. Not much to complain about. Symptoms are normal. Slight increase in anxiety, but anxiety doesn’t bother me nor will it kill me. This i have learned. It’s human. 
Other than nerve pain and waking up early and some depression/not able to concentrate as well I’m doing fine. I take adderall and drink three large green teas a day. No panic attacks. I’m mainly fatigued if anything. Anyway. I’m doing fine. In a few weeks I’ll be down to 20 then probably taking the taper slower. Positive thinking actually neurologically rewires your brain. I exercise, eat healthy. I don’t focus on my symptoms and if I have it I trick my brain into thinking it’s something else. When you learn numbing anxiety artificially by taking a pill instead of taking care of yourself or talking to someone is not the way to live life, no matter how hard things get, and accepting symptoms as healing, you’re already there mentally (just not physically). I learned from quitting Kratom CT ~4 year habit daily about 5 months ago that I needed to address the root cause of my life’s problems. No one told me to quit Kratom. No one even knew I had an addiction to it. I woke up one day and said I’m done living like this. No one told me to quit benzos. My psychiatrist loved pushing them at me knowing I’d need to come back for his script so he can make money. He loved it. He told me it was a great dose for 10 months of my life. I disagreed. I dropped to 35 in august, told him, and he got mad. Told me 40 mg was a perfectly normal amount of Diazepam. A week later I fired him. Found a new psych to taper me off slowly. So. That’s how it’s going I guess. I choose to think positive. Kratom withdrawal was hell and pure torture. But in a weird way I enjoyed it. And how strong I was. Haven’t experienced that torture yet with this benzo taper, then again I’ve only cut ~40% of my dose so. Then again I quit benzos cold turkey (ativan) freshman year of college and had no mental withdrawal. Didn’t even know there was a withdrawal. Was uninformed. Probably a good thing. Quit Prozac 80 mg cold turkey had no withdrawal. So now I don’t think about benzos. If I feel a negative emotion, I don’t immediately think THIS IS BENZO WITHDRAWAL! That way of thinking might not help everyone but dwelling on rebound anxiety and assuming you’re trapped in despair for months will only worsen your taper. Keep busy, stay positive, and be confident. if you told me 6 months ago i would make the decision to take away all these feel good meds at my own choice i wouldve laughed in your face. Mind over matter my friends. if i had known stopping ativan cold turkey 3 years ago would give me  anxiety i probably would be dwelling on it 24/7. giving me more anxiety. now that i have coping techniques for anxiety that i didnt even have 10 months ago, and a different mindset im prepared. if i have a panic attack it wont kill me. if i have a seizure which i highly doubt ill have given im doing a 7-8 month long taper on a drug i had been on for 10 months, i will have one. cant do much about that. if i feel depressed, i know it will pass. ive learned to accept emotions and i think that is crucial to recovery. and if youre going through hell, keep going.",8

Today like yesterday I took 3/4 of the M30 pill but today no Clam. I’m on 2.5 ML of Flualprazolam which should be 1.25 mg. 

Is it better to be on Flu than Clam? I have Flubromazolam which I’ve only tried once and I heard not to do it for many reasons. I also have Bromazolam and I can order another RC if necessary I think since the FDA benzos I have have many issues. 

Valium is the hardest for me to metabolize and causes me severe issues and klonopin is not much better. It also doesn’t seem like trying to get back on my Xanax bars makes any sense, right?

I’m just lost af on a long Leave of Absence from work AGAIN and doubtful that I’m going to be able to be a functional member of society when I’m constantly in a state of flux and sleep my life away cuz I’m drugged up all day everyday.

Anyone who cares to share their own personal experiences or opinions are very much appreciated. 

I’ve been using clam almost daily for 1-2 years now (much more in the last year than the prior). I know how dangerous that is so obviously I’m thinking I’m fucked and there is no way out especially since I’ve been on benzos mostly klonopin for about 7 years but in the last 2 years I’ve been on a benzo dose and type rollercoaster resulting in further damage abs kindling and now my old opiate addiction from years ago is back adding even more danger.

Just to share a small success story: it’s not as great as some of the other stories and I am aware I wasn’t on a high dose of aprazolam (only 1mg/ day, sometimes 1.5 on bad days) and only for a few months (6 months) but still, can give some hope to « short time » users who, like me, developed a quick psychological dependance to the drug (in my case, I started taking alprazolam because I had anxiety linked to a somatic disease I had that sent me to intensive care - tried prazepam and diazepam first but they don’t make me sleepy and I wanted something to relax instead of a sleep inducer like lormetazepam or zolpidem. So I took alprazolam because it had the best effect on me - and of course, I was afraid to spend more sleepless nights without Xanax).

I experienced bad anxiety induced insomnia and alprazolam helped a bit.

I tapered down to .125 now (I’m sure it’s more of a ´placebo’ dose for me at this point but hey, will jump when I feel comfortable :-)) with close to no side effect (bit nauseous, bit anxious, clenched jaw/muscles and that’s it) and… I can sleep again!

Ok so I’ve been on legit prescribed lorazepam (Ativan) for the past 14 months. I’m on 3mg daily for anxiety. I’ve been at that level pretty much the entire time. I am also on methadone for a fentanyl/heroin addiction (128 mg, daily liquid methadone). I’ve been on that for 6 months. I’m clean and haven’t used any illicit opioids in 5 months. The methadone truly saved my life. Like I said I’m stable on both meds and everything is going good. I would really like to get off the Ativan as I don’t think I need it anymore but I’m def dependent. I’m sure it would be disastrous to jump off cold turkey. 
Anyone have a taper suggestion that might work? I’ve only been on Ativan for 1 year and 2 months. Take 1 mg 3 times a day. 
Thanks for any advice!!!",3

Reflects our own worth

She has had a prescription for about 10 years for  panic attacks.

Never really understood how addictive these can be and how the symptoms of withdrawal can be days after the last dose unlike other drugs.

She takes about 5mg (half a pill) about once a week or sometimes none for several weeks, other times maybe even twice a week but not often  more. Takes them only at night to help with terrible insomnia she has had all her life as they work great and sleeping pills so far haven't worked well.

She can't really recall withdrawal symptoms between doses,  with this but until now didn't know that these would hit several days after the last pill so maybe she was who knows.

As she feels aniexty and depression often and is ADHD, it might be hard to know if maybe the withdraw is happening between does or whatever and mimic this or if taking a dose once a week is because of the symptoms she is masking .. if that makes sense.

One thing is this drug is one of the best to put her to sleep and going nights without sleep is awful so taking pill seems mild but having an addictions doesn't.

How can she find out if she is dependant on this drug and what should she do to quit. Don't worry we will talk to her doctor also but hope we can be open here to ask advice as a great first step we have chosen to take.",1

Apparently, screens aren't my only issue as I tried to play a not too complex boardgame with my friends but it was too much information to manage and I reached the same state.

It seems that my mental endurance is low, very low compared to my previous baseline before quitting alprazolam.

Given that, I noticed that 300+ of pregabalin helps a bunch but I don't want to be stuck with another drug.

That being said, I was wondering if there is something that helps with this particular symptom or that at least in theory could help.

I was thinking about NAD+ and/or LDN.

What are your views? Suggestions are much welcomed.

Blurry Vision, Brain Fog, Really heightened anxiety, Crushing headaches, sometimes tension, sometimes migraine, Muscle weakness, Fatigue, Dizziness, Inability to concentrate, Aches/Pains, Weight loss

I know it was a low dose, but as I said with me having a sensitive system I do believe this is withdrawal. Today has marked 14 days since I took my last pill, I likely should’ve weaned, but I didn’t realize any of this and I guess it’s too late now. I have had countless physical tests and blood work, and my blood work has come back 100% healthy, so I can’t think of anything else other than withdrawal.

I was prescribed 0.5 mg klonopin daily for about 4 years. After learning about the dangers of this medication, I wanted off. About 7 months ago I started to work on a taper with a psychiatrist with Valium. I have been doing great up until now. About two weeks ago I was taking 1 mg Valium every other night without issue. I was told after this I could safely drop off. I then started to take 1 mg intermittently last week. My last dose was last Thursday. Yesterday I experienced nausea and diarrhea. Today I’ve had a panic attack, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pounding headache. Could this be withdrawal or something else? I freaked out and just took 1 mg and I still feel sick. I reached out to my psychiatrist to ask for help, but wanted to see if anyone here had similar experiences. I have a lot of GI issues to begin with, and this stomach ache and headache came out of nowhere today. I just want off this medication, but don’t know how to do it and still function.

So it's been 5 full days since I took anything.

Did a 5 week taper of about 2 weeks at 0.5mg, 2 weeks at 0.25mg and last few days at .125mg. Seems fast compared to many of the posts I've read on here, and maybe it was, but I started taking mirtazapine right before my taper and was able to go down easily to 0.5mg right away since it helped so much with sleep.

I actually didn't really have any withdrawal issues during the 5 weeks other than some minor increased anxiety. However, starting yesterday and into today my anxiety has been through the roof. I'm having panic attacks, constant anxiety, head pressure/headache, vertigo, heart rate is up 20 beats higher than normal, etc. I'm also now freaking myself out worried about having seizures since I tapered relatively quickly.

I was thinking it might be worthwhile to resume tapering again tonight starting at like 0.25mg for a few more weeks, but I think that may be the anxiety kicking in.

If I wasn't panicked about having a seizure I would probably be fine. But I also don't want my fear of having one to cause me to restart my taper if I just need to wait a couple more days to feel better.

**History**: 

Severe toxic allergic reaction to an anti biotic flagyl, led to prescription of Valium, an SSRI and later Ativan. Total use of benzos around 6-9 months. 1mg Ativan to sleep, and intermittent Valium during the day. 3 month taper. 

I was only prescribed these for side effects caused by other medications. I previously suffered anxiety but managed it without meds. 

**Remaining symptoms**: 

- head pressure, vice like feeling, achy back of head, tingly sensations, stabbing feeling (lots of head related stuff) 
- DRPDP has improved a lot but still remains and causes existential looping thoughts in public sometimes 
- agoraphobia 
- achy head, neck, back, shoulders 
- patches of depression and hopelessness 
- tinnitus 
- issues with memory and brain fog 
- face and eye pressure 

**Things that have gone:**

- the brain fog has diminished a lot  
- rocky boat feeling 
- daily crying 
- skin crawling feeling 


I seem to be healing in windows and waves. In my waves all above symptoms are severe, and in my windows everything is more mild. In the last couple of months I have been to a picnic, a cafe, beach and the shops. However, things are not yet comfortable. 

I don’t feel anywhere near up to working yet, which makes me sad and hopeless sometimes, as it seems many on here manage to work. I miss being a teacher more than words can express. 

My symptoms are both mentally and physically debilitating, which I think is largely due to the nature of being polydrugged. I’m also on a strong natural gut protocol to get rid of some gut issues I believe made me vulnerable to all of this in the first place. The supplements are strong though which I think is adding to my feelings of being unwell. 

I’ve met so many amazing, kind, caring, inspiring people on here and they’re honestly a big reason I keep going. It’s comforting to meet others online who understand exactly what you’re going through. I’m grateful for that.",8

Quit Kratom with Psych prescribing me benzos but then got hooked on my Xanax 1mg's this past week. I was taking them as prescribed for one week and then had a huge panic attack and everything collapsed in life at once again and I decided to snort one. Then I did the next day too then the next more then more. Now I am here doing probably 4mg everyday. But I have only been doing this for a week now as well. Someone please help me get back to when I was doing good as prescribed. I had a taper plan and great outlook then I started doing too many and it went opposite and I'm so scared. Please comment anything. I appreciate and love you all for helping me. We all got this I keep reminding myself that but I'm the advocate for my own demise I feel sometimes. So I just want to reach out to a trusted community here who Understands.,2
