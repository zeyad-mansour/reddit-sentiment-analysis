To make a long story short i was cut off from a long acting benzo after 7 years.  A two month taper was not enough and I am still struggling.  This is a terrible thing to deal with.  I used about every RC benzo out there till I got discouraged and started with etizolam without knowing its extremely half short life.  I recently read something about using phenibut to jump off and that there is a toxicity level above on Etizolam above 2 mg per day.  I know where i can phenibut but do i need that problem as well? When I woke up this morning after using 3 mg of the 50 I have left (live in a state where it is not illegal) so I am not in legal trouble.  I was feeling sedated and after using about 5 g of bali and eating an apple i felt back to normal.  The other day i also felt very sedated and sick so I used a shot of OPMS Kratom and it was though the scales fell from my eyes.  I think I should not take the whole shot anymore though because I was hyper and I think my significant other noticed.  I have not hidden it from anyone as some users do.  My friends and family are on my side. This etizolam is so strong that it is impossible to wake up and have used all the packages. I admit it does help me fall and stay asleep for at least 3 to 4 hours and then I have to redose.  I am now writing down how much i use since the last time I ran out i could not find a doctor or treatment center to help me except for one that severe heroin addicts and alcoholics at the end of their rope use.  I was in hell waiting 9 days till my next package came and I cannot let it happen again, so i am splitting the pills in half one at a time so I have 100.  Since Bali Kratom helps me wake up and stay up, .... and in my case it is not hard to come off of, I am more inclined to use that as well as lemon balm during the day to help stay awake and reduce cravings.   We are going shopping Saturday and I have a list of Gabargenic foods.  I also have nutritional shakes and have a list of foods to stay away from.  So yes, reducing my dosage and getting the things I need including exercise and the hot tub and sauna/steam room help.  I should be going there daily.  I finally got a call for a job that may start soon and since the half life is so short i pray they don't test for benzos and it won't be found in my system.  As for any nausea it seems to go away with food.  I will pick up some ginger. Any thoughts?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49936575}"

I normally get up 7:30-8 and was 100% stabilized before this cut. Nothing I ‘be learned in therapy worked for getting back to sleep this time. Fortunately I have a job where I can wfh today and call in sick tomorrow, but idk. Maybe I should go back to 0.125mg for a little longer and cut at a better time. This level of sleep just doesn’t feel sustainable for me long term, but it’s also been only 2 days...

I haven't taken klonopin in the past 2 days (took 4 days straight before), and my question is should I try to have a more uniformed taper?

I'm obviously wanting to talk to him before proceeding getting off these pills. But from what I've read online to taper off correctly you cut the pill 10-20% every three weeks. I only have 7 of these 0.5 Klonopins left too so I need to make them last as long as I can also. 

In March and then July I went cold turkey off of these and it was PURE HELL. So obviously the correct way is to slowly get off them.

I have tons of Gabapentin pills as well, and I've read that these can help withdrawal effects as well.

But they would not do a benzodiazepine detox because of the time and type of treatment involved.  I was seeing a county drug counselor for help also.  He helped me with a method to get proper medical treatment for the benzo detox.  After he explained how I needed to go about this the choice was mine.  At this point I was ready to anything to get off these.  The way it worked (and it did for me, successfully) was for me to admit myself to the ER at a county hospital and explain that I was contemplating hurting my self(suicidal).  They admitted me and soon transferred me to the county psych ward.  After being admitted a staff member brought me to a room for an intake interview.  The people present in the interview room was a psychiatrist, medical doctor, and RN.  The question from them was what my plan for taking my own life was and why.  For my response I looked at them and stated that I did not plan on taking my own life, or hurting myself and that they were my last option for getting off and safely detoxing off of benzodiazepines. I pleaded my case and told my story and they told me they would help me with this and get me through the medical detox part then help me find a treatment center.  It definitely was not a place anybody would want to spend anytime at all in, but I was there for a little over a month then moved on to a residential treatment center.  The bottom line is they help me detox safely off of the benzo's.  My life is much better today, in fact it's great.  I really love and enjoy life nowadays.  I hope this help's anybody that is stuck in that hopeless dark place I call hell on earth.",22,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5052686}"

Over a few years, I maybe used about 15 of them, for the prescribed reasons. No huge deal there.

I don’t have an ongoing prescription for Klonopin anymore and that doctor has disappeared off the face of the earth, so the ~45 tablets was all I had left. I was diagnosed with a severe mast cell disorder a few months ago that causes me a lot of horrible, painful, anxiety-inducing symptoms. Desperate for relief - as I’m still very sick and not well controlled by my other meds - I took 1mg of Klonopin (it’s a mast cell stabilizer), and it really, really helped. I also realized that I really liked how it made me feel. My condition has made me very depressed and hopeless and I feel blissful on Klonopin. I’ve been taking it daily for a little short of a month now, sometimes taking 1.5mg instead. It helps my symptoms, but I know I’m taking it because I like it and I feel like I need to take it. I take it at night but I feel foggy in the mornings and it’s beginning to affect my schooling. I want to stop. I have 10 tabs left.

I don’t even know if I’ve been taking it long enough to worry about physical dependence. I tried to look online to see what I could expect if I just quit cold turkey, but all I found were help lines for people in crisis. I kind of want to stop now and leave those remaining tabs for their prescribed use (my PTSD anxiety attacks) but I’m not sure if just quitting is safe.

My questions:

 1) If I quit cold turkey after about a month of 1-1.5mg daily Klonopin use, what are my withdrawal risks? Is this a big deal following such a short timeline of use, or can I just go for it?

2) Should I try to taper with the remaining 10 tabs? Would that be at all helpful or necessary?

It was fifteen years ago this month that I received my first prescription of Alprazolam. Little did I know what a profound affect that pill I had vaguely heard of would have on my life.

 It was prescribed to me a few months after I had a mild stroke, or TIA. Though I had mostly physically recovered, I began to have sudden episodes of dizziness and vertigo, as well as bouts of severe dread. After numerous tests my neurologist sent me to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed PTSD and Panic Disorder and wrote that first scrip.

The pills worked for me right away, and for months I was able get by with only needing to take them (1mg 2xa day) a couple times a week. I was able to continue working as well as most of my social activities. Eventually, though, my panic episodes started to become more frequent, which eventually led to my taking the Alprazolam every day for the following eight years.  

During that time I began missing work as the thought of leaving the house would bring on a panic attack. Then there were the bouts of depression that became so bad that I was hospitalized involuntarily for a short time. That experience led to being put on and taken off of various SSRI and psych drugs which only made things worse. It got to the point where I had to medically retire from my job and go on disability.

I was finally able to do a short six month Valium cross-taper and wean myself off of the benzos. That in turn led to my doc prescribing me Seroquel in order to ""smooth out the rough edges"" of the benzo withdrawal. That was about seven years ago, and in that time I stayed housebound for nearly two and a half years. I also deal with brain fog and tinnitus every single day, and at times my short and long term memory is shot. I also put on about fifty pounds and my blood pressure is quite high. 

I should apologize. I didn't mean for this to scare anyone dealing with you own recovery or bring you down. There are plenty of people who have recovered and are leading successful post-benzo lives. I am just mourning what I have lost these last several years to this drug. I used to be a very active person that enjoyed traveling and hanging out with people. Now I can't drive more than 20 miles from my house without feeling uncomfortable.

I started abusing etizolam about 3 months ago, what drew me to it was the reverse tolerance for the first month of use. I could take the same dose every day and get higher and higher. Mostly I’d take it orally but sometimes I’d IV it when I was high on my oral doses (up to 100mg in a sitting). I probably went through about 1.5 grams in 2 months (1mg etiz=10mg Valium roughly). 
One of my last doses was 750mg orally. After that I tried to ween off with the remaining 250mg. I had no idea what I was doing. 3 days later I took my ration for the day of 10mg but still had a pounding head ache so I decided to go around to my mates house because I knew his girlfriend had gabapentin which I thought may tickle the same receptors to avoid breaking my taper. She offered me codeine instead and then morphine. Long story short I ended up in hospital that night where they defibbed me back to life. 
From then I spiralled out of control and ended up taking my 250mg in a week. 2 days later it was back to hospital after I collapsed outside of alcohol and drug counselling where they put me on 40mg of Valium a day for a week. I then met my psychiatrist where I convinced him to put me on clonazepam 4mg a day instead for its longer half life. I stayed on that for a few weeks until I went to the psych ward for a supervised taper. 
They started me on 120mg a day there and over the course of 3-4 weeks I was brought down to nothing. 
My shakes have only just started coming right but the anxiety is still killing me.

A) Lexapro side effects?

B) Klonopin WD. Noticed I was way more anxious this morning and had not taken klonopin for 72 hours.  I did take .25 mg this AM. 

C) Anxiety is just part of me and I need to not look into this too much

D) All of the above?

I have a very healthy respect and fear for benzo dependence and want to be as cautious as possible. I'm just having anxiety that I am now dependent on it and if so, what would be the best way to taper, when using .25/mg not every day? 

 I also want to be realistic that these symptoms could be caused by the Lexapro and as I adjust to this medicine, my overall anxiety will decrease and I will smoothly be able to transition to stop taking the klonopin at all very soon and am reading too much into my symptoms and they're not klonopin withdrawal?

I've been taking SSRI + Xanax (on ""as needed"" basis) for 4 months and to be frank with you, in the beginning it was good for sleep and anxiety spikes caused by an SSRI, but now I feel it's completely unnecessary as my sleep is good and everything's fine, however if I don't take it, within 24 hours I get ""teleported"" into a kind of parallel universe filled with this feeling of utter dread and madness which is so untolerable that I feel no option but to take another Xanax pill. Basically I'm on a rollercoaster - every day I experience these ups and downs, feeling fine, then horrible and I can't take it anymore.

I've tried tapering it on my own without success. I dissolved my pills in water and measured precise amounts which I would take every 8 hours, and tried to reduce bit by bit, but the results were bad, I was still basically stuck on that same dose of 0.25mg a day.

So, what do I do? I'm pretty desperate. As I said, my psychiatrist doesn't even believe I'm dependant 'cause it such a ""small dose"" and ""short amount od time"" that I've been taking it, but I wouldn't say that 4 months is a short amount time, and day by day it's only strenthtening my dependance because I'm unable to go off of it.

I have a bunch of Diazepams (2 mg) laying around the house, should I attempt to convert to Diazepam since it has a very long half-life and go from there or will I get myself even more dependant (poly-drug dependant, cross-dependant or whatever)? Does Diazepam ""taper itself"" because of half-life and will it free me from these frequent ups and downs?

On December 15th I said enough is enough and went on an ill advised CT. Honestly I was a bit jittery for two days but after that was fine and was about 3 weeks off no problems. I had some serious life events, near suicide of a close family member amount others and was having trouble sleeping to reached for the poison known as zoplicone. This crap works for me maybe once, then after that causes so. much anxiety and a withdrawal feeling that its not worth it. Couple this with the personal issues I deal with at this time and I went and got a very limited script for clonazepam. Now, I know my tolerance, being a muscular 215 man is up there, but two days in a row, in the evening I took 5-6 mugs, no more. Was not high, just allowed me to mellow out a bit and eliminate the residual effects of the sh itty zoplicone. Anyway here I am on Saturday , feeling just fine, but my old faulty mind is worried that ""oh I'm addicted again"", here come the withdrawals, etc. I know logically this is not likely the case as I said I feel fine, esp only after 2 days of use, and have no intentions of using it again.

Reason for deciding to post is that all of what I read were regarding people coming off long term benzo use(1yr or much longer). 

Before I start I’ll give a short back story. I’ve been addicted to opiates for far too long than I’d like to even say due to being ashamed. I am currently on methadone(horrible decision) and have been for almost 2yrs. I also suffer from horrible depression and anxiety which led me to begin taking Xanax and sometimes Klonopin. I was always against benzos because I was scared to death of all the wd stories and would only take them to get sleep when wding from opiates. 

Fast forward to current and I’ve gained an addiction to benzos. Few months back I was taking Xanax for at least 3months straight 2-4mg daily. I knew not to quit ct so I was fortunate enough to get klonopin and used those on a taper schedule. I quit and was fine. I stopped using benzos for almost two months and then unfortunately relapsed and started using them again right after Xmas up until now. I’ve done around 100mg since Xmas. I started off taking 4-6mg daily and realized I was messing up bad and have tapered down to like 1mg daily. I have 3 bars left and then I’m screwed.

Does anyone have experience with this type of short term use and know if wd symptoms are going to be severe to where seizures may be a possibility, missing work, etc? The seizure part scares me because I live alone. I also have a very good job that I can’t jeopardize over this so missing work isn’t a possibility. I do have the option to sometimes work at home if i feel it gets to bad I can’t be around people. I’m just so mad at myself for starting them again. I was so proud for stopping and feeling back to normal. I just suffer such bad anxiety and depression that sometimes I can’t take it and I know there are other options but my work schedule makes it hard to get in to see a Dr and in my area they all want to throw prozac at you which I’m not interested in.

Been looking to talk to like minded people about my ongoing problems for a while now. I guess I should share my story.

I suffered an initial withdrawal from Valium around four years ago, that lasted about a month - worst experience of my life. I then suffered what appears to a protracted withdrawal two years later which I have to this day. I must say it isn't from a relapse of taking the drug, I haven't touched a single one since.

I was never prescribed Valium, stupidly, I bought it on the black market being told they were sleeping tablets. I used to suffer with a bit of a bad sleep pattern so I thought these things were great, naively.

I'm a big guy 6'5"" 260lbs, so I built up a tolerance really quick. I took them for around one year, at times taking as much as 100mg.

When I eventually could no longer source anymore I wasn't too fussed, sleep was quite in check. Little did I know two weeks later, I would be hit with a withdrawal from hell that I didn't even know was a thing. It truly was the worst experience of my life, I thought I had went insane, it wasn't until about a week into it that I figured out what it was. Lost my job because going into work wasn't even an option.

The withdrawal subsided after a month or so, and I swore I was done with any form of drug - and I have been, other than the odd bit of booze here and there.

Second part of the story is around two years ago, two years after my experience I started to feel like how I did back then all over again, albeit not quite as severe, but still clearly what I knew to be a withdrawal. It all made no sense, I thought the withdrawal was over, upon doing a bit research I'm now fully aware some of us can suffer protracted symptoms, and that's where I still am today.

Even since the initial protracted symptoms kicked in, I have gotten better, but I'm still not perfect, they come and go. Mainly the cog fog, and a hazy distant stoned feeling at times.

I'm getting on with my life, and trying to not let it effect me too much. Don't know if I'm just being defeatist, but I'm starting to feel that I could be like this forever. It's just been so long that I've felt 100%.

I'm wondering if anyone else has a similar story to mine, and would be especially interested to hear from anyone who has made it out of the other side after being trapped in a withdrawal for so long.

thanks,

(Story),"The process for me took three months, first I didn't know I was experiencing tolerance withdrawals, but before I got into it let me tell you how I found out it was.

About seven months ago I was experiencing severe depression, depersonalization, derealization, thoughts of self harm, terrible panic attacks in the middle of the night and more. It was so bad I was calling a crisis line every week. I had no access to a therapist or medical services because I moved to another country and was still an immigrant at the time, therefore I rationed what medicine I could.

Obviously it didn't turn out so well, I didn't take klonopin for three days and after a short nap, I woke up and felt an urge I never experienced before, the sinking feeling of hopelessness and to end my life. It was then I had a severe panic attack, passed out twice and had seizures. The shaking wouldn't stop, I was extremely agitated and felt like everyone was against me and nobody understood me. What was worse was being isolated because I didn't know anyone in this new country I moved to besides my wife.

After I was rushed to the ER, placed into an outpatient treatment centre and went back on my medication. After a few months the symptoms subsided a little but wouldn't let up. I was then convinced it was something to do with my medicine. When I finally got medical coverage I had my hospital bills paid for, switched anti-depressants and started my klonopin taper.

Today, I feel better actually (knock on wood). The withdrawal symptoms were hellish, but I feel okay now. I do experience withdrawal symptoms still but they're quite manageable thanks to my new anti-depressants, a new therapist and a loving and understanding wife. 

If I can get through this, you can too, but remember you're never alone and you must accept that you need support to get through this. You must also accept that it might be horrible to experience this, but it'll go away in time like all things.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66052526}"

I was first put on benzos at age 16 for panic attacks related to an incident with a mushroom 'overdose' and the depersonalization that followed. Long story short, all of that resolved itself for the most part over the past 6 years and I'm now just dealing with chronic depression. 



Here's the thing though.. I've been on this dose of clonazepam for so long that I'm not only experiencing acute physical withdrawals in the hours leading up to my daily dose but I've noticed a very clear relationship between my treatment resistant depression/anhedonia and the fact that I'm entirely dependent on this drug. I can only think clearly, focus, and somewhat enjoy things *after* I've taken my 1mg @ 4 PM. More and more the thought of facing a taper or withdrawal has made its way into my mind because of the starkness of this daily cycle. 

Am I fucked? I mean, the thought of being trapped in bed with even worse depression + pain/muscle spasms/insomnia and potential seizures just makes me contemplate killing myself right here and now out of a purely pragmatic stance. (No, don't worry, I'm not a naturally suicidal person and I'm not going to do anything) but those are the types of thoughts running through my mind as I ponder what lies ahead for me if I should choose to pursue a taper. I've seen a lot of success stories online but a hell of a lot more despairing people with very little hope.. And the fact that my cognition/body are so closely tied to this drug only makes the thought of starting withdrawal even scarier.

Story and questions.

I've been addicted to benzos going on 10 years now. Currently prescribed 2.5mg of Klonopin but I do tend to add to that.

I was diagnosed with panic disorder 10 years ago when no one cared it seemed what they gave out. I was on Xanax for 7 years from the lowest dose to 5mg a day. The scary part is I started at 16, my brain wasn't even fully growing. My current psychiatrist decided to switch me to the Klonopin I'm on now. 

I haven't had a panic attack in 5 years. Heck I haven't had anxiety in really long time. I wanted to get off this for years because even a day and a half without it the withdrawal would come and I couldn't stand it. I hated waking up knowing I was going to work needing a pill to simply get through the day. I felt like I was hiding some dirty secret. But I guess we all have them.

I finally have time to go to treatment. I'm lucky and I have good health insurance. I knew what I wanted in a treatment, a detox, a 30-45 inpatient stay then PHP. That's hard to find. Warning, I spoke to like 67 people, either brokering addiction centers or running their own. When you look up detox and addiction online you get all these random websites that you call, but they tend to be kinda salesy from my experience. And many get a fee for placement so know that. Always go with your gut. The one I chose was small, privately owned, and the guy I talked to didn't give me the song and dance. He was honest and said how fucking hard it would be to come off this after being on it for so long and relatively young. He was, God, I can't say enough about these honest and truly caring people.

I leave in 3 weeks, and I'm terrified but ready. I went out of state to make it harder for visitors because I've been inpatient before for something else and the people who had lots of visitors left early. 

For people that have gone through medical detox, is it really terrible? I'm most afraid of that. I don't care about inpatient, I've done it before. But I started taking these at 16. I'm 26. This has been with me over 1/3 of my life. I'm afraid I'm gonna be a different person. In your centers what did you find most helpful through your journey?

We have a wicked genetic variant in our family for anxiety.  I somehow found myself in sales as a career in 2003, and after awhile the stress and anxiety started to periodically hit me, but I still enjoyed sales so I decided to ask around the family on how they were dealing with panic and what not.

My dad then told me that he took a little white pill called Lorazepam, that helped him before doing presentations at work.  He gave me one.  I took it before meeting with clients and it became a game changer.  I was selling like crazy and the anxiety was gone(while on these little magic pills). Then I started seeing his Dr.  the Doc already knew about him so reluctantly prescribed the medication to me, with an addiction warning.  

Fast forward 10 years.  I’ve been addicted to the pill physically at least 3 times and self-tapered each time.  I’d say I took between .5 and 3mg per day and averaged about 1.5 most of the last decade.

Now after(yes after) joining this subreddit, I realized that a lot of my symptoms ...muscle pain, confusion and difficulty learning were causing major life issues.  not to mention I was also diagnosed with both ADHD and CPSTD and prescribed adderal and abused both together while drinking alcohol.  I also noticed while on this concoction I felt both energized and anxiety free but I was also becoming difficult to be around.  So now I am drug free, while still consuming alcohol in moderation.

This addiction cycle I was averaging 1mg a day, tapered to .5 and yesterday, zero.  As I was tapering I immediately noticed joint and muscle pain diminishing.  Today at the gym for the first time I felt my most clear headed with greater strength.

about a year ago I had a major depressive disorder episode, I was hospitalized in psychiatry ward. They put me on antidepressant and temporarily Xanax. I weaned off the Xanax during a period of 2-3 months and was ok. I don't remember the exact dosage, but I think It was 3-4x0.5 mg daily.

About three weeks ago I began to experience anxiety again. I took some Xanax from the leftovers I had at home.

I was taking 0.5 mg pill daily for about two-three weeks. Slowly I began experience sleeping and mood disorders. I realized it must be the Xanax. I stopped taking the pills three days ago. Now I cannot sleep, have terrible depressions and all kind of muscle sores. After just one 0.5 mg pill daily.

THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT!


I will be setting a plan with my doctor on the 23rd to taper off Klonopin. 

I’m prescribed 2mg pills, three times a day. However, I only take one 2mg pill before bed and only take another if I need it (which I haven’t in a while).

History - I will be 42 years old this year - I was first prescribed Lorazepam when I was 19. Slowly my milligrams were increased when they lost effectiveness.

Then I was switched to Xanax.  I weaned off the Xanax while trying to get pregnant in 2009, was off them for the pregnancy, but had my husband bring my Xanax to the hospital so I could take one the day after having my son (I didn’t breastfeed). 

In 2014, a horrible psychiatrist switched me to Klonopin, which I have been on since. 

Back when I was about 21, I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressants, all different kinds from age 21 to age 40.  All of them failed me. 

I do believe now that the benzos caused my depression and I should have never gone on antidepressants. I weaned off the antidepressants with my doctor and my last dose was 5/31/19. 

I was very sick coming off the antidepressants, even weaning slowly. I started taking CBD in August which seemed to balance me out - I even joined a gym.

However in November I went downhill. I have PTSD and I believe I repressed mostly everything until I was no longer numb from the antidepressants.  

I’ve been extremely depressed and to add to that, I have PMDD, so once a month I feel like I want to die. I will never attempt suicide because I would never leave my son.

Anyway - I’m not working. My husband makes enough to support us and I’m getting disability.

TLDR / the point of my post - Can I tough out the taper at home or do any of you who have come off benzos recommend checking into a hospital for it?

I don’t drink alcohol or so drugs except I smoke weed (since 1994) and take LSD maybe 2-3 times a year (I do not plan to take any psychedelics during my benzo taper).

I'm a male, 24 years old, 5ft9 and 75 kgs. For the past months I've been tapering diazepam. In December, I took a break at 8 mgs. One week ago, my regular dose felt way more sedating than usual, and by now I even feel sedated if I take 0,25 mg a day. I'm not sure what has caused this sudden increase in perceived sedation from diazepam, and am scared to decrease my dose too quickly. Conversely, I don't want to feel the effects as I want to taper down and get of this drug, so I don't want my dose to be too high either. I would really appreciate any insights or help. Thank you all so much. Some more information below.

I was diagnosed with heart disease 1,5 years ago. For the last 6 months, i've taken the exact same drugs/supplements:

* Nicorandil 20mg x2 daily
* Ranolazine (Ranexa) 500mg x2 daily
* Bisoprolol 2,5mg x2 daily
* Omega 3 fish oil x 2 daily
* Vitamin A, B, C, E supplement x 1 daily
* N-acetylcysteine 600mg x2 daily
* Magnesium malate 2000 mg daily I do not drink grapefruit juice.

Aside from these drugs/supplements, i was prescribed 2mg Xanax daily 1,5 years ago as they suspected my symptoms were due to a panic disorder. As soon as it was clear that it was heart disease, i started a taper to get off Xanax. Over the course of 5 months i gradually tapered down from 2 mg's xanax daily to 1 mg. At that point, i was switched from 1mg xanax to 8mg diazepam over the course of 1 month (November). I tolerated the switch without any problems other than ringing ears. In december I was on 8 mg diazepam daily (4x2mg every 6 hours) without tapering down, to adjust to the diazepam. I take my medication on a fixed schedule. I'm 100% positive i never miss a dose or take a dose twice, as i prepare my doses for a few days at a time. I do not drink any alcohol, soft drink and i do not smoke.

In the first 4 weeks of 8mg diazepam daily and no more xanax, everything felt pretty stable, with some mild withdrawal symptoms but overall far better compared to xanax alone. One week ago, out of the blue, I felt extremely sedated by the exact same doses i was taking before. Nothing has changed regarding my diet, medication, lifestyle,..

My main concern is obviously that i don't want to go backwards in my taper. However, I do not understand what would cause me to feel this sedated while nothing has changed.

I started the taper about 5 days ago and to be honest I still haven’t really found a dose that keeps me stable, as it’s hard to gauge what my body is used to because I was abusing unprescribed benzos, so I was just taking whatever it took to get barred. I started my taper at 2mg diclazepam a day, I tried this by doing 1mg in the morning and 1mg at night, and by just doing the full 2mg at night. Both ways I experience semi-severe interdose withdrawal symptoms. So I’m thinking I need to up my dose to 3mg a day (1mg morning, 2mg night) and maybe even more because I was abusing these other benzos daily and quite heavily, though only for a period of about one month (however this is my second time going through benzo wd so I’m sure kindling has taken place.) so to get to my main point, is it normal to have interdose wd at your starting stable dose? Or should my starting stable dose be a dose where I feel no wd, but also don’t feel any benzo effects and just feel completely normal? And if the ladder is the case, then when I do begin to start tapering down should I expect to have interdose wd symptoms? Or should I only decrease my dosage at a rate that I don’t experience wd at all? (excluding the final phases where I know wd symptoms will be felt) I have read the Ashton manual but it doesn’t really apply to short term but heavy abusers like myself, and I just need to know if dealing with this interdose wd is a good thing that means I’m recovering, or if it’s just needless suffering.

· Severe anxiety and cortisol surges.

· Insomnia. Only able to sleep an hour uninterrupted, total sleep 2-3 hours per night.

· Hypersensitivity to bright light and unexpected sounds.

· Lack of appetite and nausea. Bloated benzo belly. Lost 25 lbs, but was also exercising.

· Dp/dr. Was worse at work especially while trying to maintain eye contact.

· No filter. Extreme irritability and anger.

· Short term memory problems that were like having a black out.

· Tinnitus.

· Headache.

· Restless leg. Just one.

· Sweating.

All of these symptoms are either gone or so minimal that I’m no longer bothered by them -- with the exception of insomnia which is why I was prescribed diazepam in the first place. My sleep is better than it was during my withdrawal, but I still have nights where I only get a couple of hours. Still trying to get off trazodone (for sleep) and that has taken longer than my benzo taper. Amazing that it can be so difficult to get off drugs that aren’t even helping anymore.

I credit a lot of my healing to daily exercise and being outdoors. I power walk, and average 5-6 miles daily. (I live in a warm climate which makes that possible.)

Hope you are well. I have realised how much I messed my 30s up, with benzos and booze after working in high profile positions. This isn't good, but I can't do anything about it and have to look forward. I'm thinking of retraining once I can cope with recalling things, my memory and mental process are severely affected.

Now, I have terrible anxiety - the drink helped me socialise first then the two took over, to the extent that I am scared of leaving my flat.

I know many people here suffer similarly and well, I am open to suggestions of at-home activities I can do to rewire my brain. In my early 40s, I am going to relocate to where my family lives in a small town, get out of London UK as it's just stressful enough and I'm not working atm. All of my friends have left, and I have had enough and want a fresh start.

So I suppose my question is what next? What without freaking out can I do from home that will help me to improve? I hopefully will be going to rehab but for those who have come out the other side any, even small advise that helped you would be great.

Over time I began having difficulty going to sleep and I began to taking 1-3 mg a night to fall asleep. Over time this escalated into taking them every day Untill after a year or 2 I found myself taking 2-3 2MG bars 3 times a day or about 15mg a day. My drug dealer got thrown in jail and then I became desperate so I began working with a old high school buddy who was a pharmacy tech to forge prescriptions. I succeeded in this and was prescribed 120mg a month plus excess pills that he stole from his work. This went on for about a year, during which I managed to wean down to about 3MG a day. About 8 months ago my front door was kicked in by the pharmaceutical police unit and my parents were flash banged and hand cuffed while the police utterly destroyed my room and took about 200 mg worth of pills from my room. 

Having my come to Jesus moment but also Not knowing what to do The next I went to the ER hoping to be treated for Benzo withdrawal. I went in on a Friday night, was thrown into the psych ward, had my phone taken from me, and out into purple scrubs. I sat on a gurney in the hallway for 16 hours due to overcrowding where I received minimal attention. After 7 hours I was given some Ativan, I obviously felt Better. Then a few hours later I was told I was being discharged because my symptoms weren’t “acute enough.” So I decided to go to my aunt and uncles house and detox on my own; I had heard detoxing in a non familiar environment was recommended. For 5 nights I went through a total psychotropic experience often hallucinating and having what felt like 8 years of anxiety occurring non stop all at once. I was sweating, having mild DT’s, couldn’t eat, didn’t want to drink, hallucinating scary shit, and feeling like I was having some sort of life or death struggle with my mind. After those 5 days I went back to the hospital after my mom yelled at psychiatrist friend to make the ER treat me even tho it’s against protocol (total white privilege moment) and I went in received a extreme minor dose of kpin and gabapentin. I was off the kpins after 7 days w/o any major issues and off the gabapentin after. 30 days. I’ve been extremely fortunate in that I have a very supportive family and girlfriend to care of me. I can’t imagine doing this on my own. I was basically a useless blob for 2
Weeks unable to make major decisions or do the simplest of tasks without anxiety. But I got better quickly, to IOP for 3 months which also helped. Right after the police charged me with 23 charges for the prescription fraud, possession, and even though I wasn’t selling intent to distribute. I eventually went to court got it reduced to 3 misdemeanors and 2 years probation. The court sentenced me to 5 NA meetings a week for 6 months and now I’m on month 2 of that sentence. It’s been a real whirlwind but i feel so blessed to be clean and to be mostly devoid of cravings. And when I do I smoke some 1:1 CBD flower and it fades away.

I know staying busy helps but I’m also lethargic as hell so unless there’s something I absolutely have to do I just don’t want to actually do anything, it’s a real catch 22.

So I was wondering what some of you guys coping mechanisms are? Things that you find help get you through the free time when you’re so restless yet lethargic. I live way out in the country in GA on 90 or so acres of land with several ponds to fish and I’m able to hunt the land and really do as I please, (these are 2 of my biggest hobbies) but even with this available to me I rarely have the desire to do either of them, and since it gets dark at 5:30 and has been raining almost non-stop I rarely get a chance to do them anyway.  So I was hoping anyone and everyone who has found something that helps them get through the down time could give some suggestions for me or for anyone else going through this.

I powered thru it with exercise and focus and was able to get off them. Bad WD lasted about 3 weeks but then symptoms started to ease up the following few months. 

Obviously this was great and I loved some of the changes (short term memory is back! Woo!) but my anxiety really spiraled this last year to the point of me being nearly unable to leave the house.

New to this subreddit, but glad to have found some kindred spirits. I’m posting to see if anyone has some advice or clarity regarding my situation. I started taking clonazepam for panic attacks about 3 and a half years ago. At first, all I needed was a quarter of the 0.5 mg prescribed, and I was only using it for panic attacks (once or twice a month at most). Fast forward a year later, and I eventually ended up on Lexapro, during which time I was able to keep my klonopin usage confined to mostly “as needed”, however, I began taking clonazepam more frequently for GAD/PTSD symptoms, thus was taking it anywhere from 1-3 days/week, anywhere from 0.25 mg – 1.5 mg in a single day. I stayed at this dosage and frequency until foolishly, last October I asked my psychiatrist to try a different benzo as I felt that it was sometimes difficult to tell when the clonazepam had started working. I was prescribed lorazepam at 0.5 mg, which I found effective for the first two months, however I did find I needed more than the prescribed, at least 1 mg per dose.

 Cue a series of stressful events and my frequency of usage started to increase, as well as my tolerance. From what I’ve read, clonazepam is much more potent per weight so I’m not sure how much it’s actually increased, but on the days I do take ativan, I need at least 3-4 mg throughout the day now (1-2 mg at a time), and even then sometimes finding that ineffective. As of the past two months, I’ve been taking ativan at least 4 times/week, but in the last three weeks, that’s increased mostly to 5 and sometimes 6 days in a week. I keep a detailed diary of my usage. Now I understand that its wisest to opt for a long taper for people taking them everyday. But what about in this scenario, where I’ve just recently run into a wall? I want to stop but typically can’t make it past 1-2 days without some sort of trigger. It’s been quite hard to separate my actual anxiety from a developing dependence or addiction. 

On top of the fact I have an extremely stressful job and living situation, as well as the fact that I recently tapered off Prozac about two weeks ago. I am attempting to chalk up my side effects to the lack of prozac, but when I read that I could be risking a prolonged withdrawal from benzos if done incorrectly, I wonder what the best course of action is, or if that advice even applies to someone in my situation, who has been using mostly PRN for several years. I want to stop completely now but don’t want to make things worse in the end than they already are. My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to appreciate the severity of my symptoms at the moment, but I’m also sure she’s not thrilled I blew threw my ativan scripts so fast. I’m currently out of ativan because I used it all up before my refill. I have a couple of 0.25 mg xanax that I’m holding onto for panic attacks only. 

My main concern right now is differentiating the symptoms of SSRI discontinuation and any possible benzo dependency/withdrawal, so I can develop a plan of action. I find that benadryl has been a godsend, particularly at night, which makes me think that a lot of these symptoms are from my body adjusting to life without SSRIs. This is day 17 off prozac, and I’ve previously never made it past 8 days, when I attempted to jump off at 10 mg. This time, I slowly tapered from 10 to 1 mg over the period of 6-7 months. I figured this would prevent the majority of SSRI discontinuation side effects, but this blows any other previous mental health crises out of the water for me. They don’t even compare. It feels like what I imagine opioid withdrawals would feel like. Inappetance, dysphoria, profuse sweating, hot and cold spells, flu like symptoms, depression, disinterest, anxiety, and sudden crying spells. Also important to note, the symptoms don’t seem to retreat much (except for panic) when I take a small-moderate dose of a benzo. It helps but its not nearly enough. Is 3-4 weeks of taking ativan 5 times a week even enough to cause withdrawal? If anyone has any helpful information or suggestions I’d really appreciate any input",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.586168}"

If no one replies that is ok I feel good typing it.  I am three years sober and in the past would drink and take klonopin at the same time although that was only for a bit.

Three years ago after five years benzo free I had a rough patch after quitting booze and took some klonopin as I took it a lot in the past.  (My doctor should never have given it to me) I started getting paradoxical reactions then I went acute tolerance?  And went three/four days with zero sleep on just 0.5mg per day.  My shrink said it was all anxiety but I had classic interdose as my legs would go weak in the evening before my next dose.

Was given ambien in the er and Ativan.   I felt calm and no reactions and convinced them to cut me over.  They gave me 2mg total per day.  Two months later the Ambien and Ativan started to make me have memory issues and anxiety went crazy and had to take a leave from work where I quit the Ambien and took mirtazapine.  I stabilized and in hindsight did not realize  the Ambien made it all worse for my receptors.  Went up to 2.5mg Ativan. 

Had issues with mirt and tapered still slept after that jump.  Main issues were my fatigue and minor muslce issues on the Ativan.  Started my taper last December and at 2mg actually felt better.  At 1mg my mood improved my work was much better and other than muscle cramping I actually thought I had narcolepsy from the sleep attacks I would get.  Often needed to nap every day.  I also went from dosing four time to three times.

Well late November I cut from 0.5 to 0.375 and just twice a day dosing.  Sleep started eroding, vision issues and nerve issues and anxiety surges all morning.  My PCP said go back up to .5 and it worked for two days then things got worse.  Three days no sleep, Benadryl gave my terrible restlessness and lack of sleep started getting akathisia almost went to ER.  Psych gave me trazodone and propanol.  I took a one time rescue dose during those but it made my restlessness worse!  I went paradoxical.  

The traz worked great the first night, now I get this very odd sleep where I feel like I did not sleep yet I drift immediately into some super intense dreams and some how hours have passed and my body has not moved.   I can’t lose more years of my life the second half of this year was good and now it has hit the fan.  I don’t think a facility would take me at only 0.5mg but I feel like I won’t be able to take care of myself and want to detox or go inpatient.

I stopped using the edibles and was fine a week after, but developed panic attacks out of the blue. They mainly happen as soon as I go to bed, and it is almost impossible to fall asleep. Even when I fall asleep I wake up in \~2 hours with a panic attack. I have a history of insomnia and anxiety at night but has never been full blown to panic attacks until the bad reaction to weed. I went to the ER again about 2 weeks ago due to a panic attack from not sleeping for 2 days. They gave me Ativan which was a miracle drug, and I was finally able to sleep at night. They let me pack 5 pills to take home. I then went to my family doctor to discuss things and he prescribed me another 7 tablets of Ativan. I'm currently on my last two tablets. I had a follow-up appointment with my family doctor and he has prescribed me another 7 tablets of Ativan (for emergency), 2 weeks worth of Propranolol (which helps tremors, heart rate and such) as substitute for Ativan and Lexapro for a long-term solution. Problem is, I took the Propranolol last night and it did absolutely nothing for me. So I stayed up all night and suffered a panic attack (had classes I needed to go to today and the anxiety of needing to sleep made things worse). Needless to say I didn't go to class and gave in to Ativan. I slept the entire morning.

I'm at my wits' end. Being sleep deprived makes me want to end the suffering, and the anxiety is making my body feel all sorts of weird.

First time use was 4 and 1/2 years ago at a high school party. 2mg ""hulk"" and drank a lot on accident. But I don't remember most of that night. Vomiting the next day. Fun till I blacked out. 


2 years ago around Dec 2017-Jan 2018 I used my friends Rx R039 yellow bars by activas.  For 2 months. Starting at doses like .5 mg in the am and .5 mg in the pm in December but starting upping doses till End of January where I stopped completely with 2mgs in the morning and 2mgs at night, didn't KO so high tolerance. Quit cold turkey. 


A month after that, my last semester at school. I was a senior in undergrad. Abused BARS again cause they were around for $2 a pill for 50 bars, did that twice but only took 20 bars for my own self both times. So 40 bars total that semester. Couldn't get a plug for xans anymore in March 2018. So I had to quit. Found someone who got me 2 bars in April and blacked out cause I drank a large beer with .5mg and woke up with half a bar left. So I took a whole bar while blacked out lol. 



Fast forward to mid-March 2019. Doctor gives me celexa for my anxiety. I use for 2 weeks and makes me more anxious so he gives me alprazolam .25mg-30 count In beginning of April. And I have a check up two weeks after. By that time I was out. He then gave me 40 count-0.5 mgs a month for 2 months. Then up to 60 count-0.5 mgs a month in the end of June. Since then I've been getting my 60 count supply since then. 

I quit in August for a week cause I took shrooms and realized I didn't need benzos. When that wore off I started to use Xanax regularly again after a week. Since then I've tried to quit them but couldn't. Instead I started using more since I had extra from that week and got some legit Rx kpins 30-1mg pills xmas time. Only took 6 of those myself but will now use for taper. I abused them lately and feel like it's done with. Leaving benzos in 2019. 

And to top it off I got SCAMMED on here for $80 for 20 bars last Friday 1-3-2020 (knew it was too good to be true) and that's when i knew I had a problem and decided this is it. No more of this devils drug. So now i am serious and am on a taper (kpin) not by my doctor and don't plan on drinking for a while and just gonna take care of myself from now on.

2020-01-07 17:02:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/elikfr/can_benzos_cause_depressionanger/,Can benzos CAUSE depression/anger?,"I posted in another group but didn’t get the answers, the two people who responded just focused on the prescription.

My doctor doesn’t want me to come off klonopin yet, because I just weaned off antidepressants this year. (Last dose was 5/31/19, I weaned over 7 months). 

I was on antidepressants for 20 years. None of them worked for me and now that I’m off them I’m finally facing the trauma from 2015 and 2017 (two separate incidents caused me PTSD). My anxiety is high because of it.

However, I’ve been on benzodiazepines for almost 23 years. 

Started with Ativan in 1997, switched to Xanax somewhere around 2008, I weaned off Xanax over a 2 month period while trying to get pregnant in 2009 and stayed off during pregnancy but got right back on them after he was born in 2010.

I was switched to Klonopin in 2014, and the milligrams increased after I was diagnosed with PTSD for the second time. 

I’m prescribed three 2 mg pills per day, but I only regularly take ONE 2 mg pill at night. 

There are times when my anxiety is extremely high and I have taken all 3 throughout the day, but 99% of the time I’m only taking 2mg.

I am on disability because of my PTSD. 

I feel as though the Klonopin might be causing depression.

I want to sleep all day (most weekdays I only get up to bring my son to school, go back to bed, and get up to pick him up - and then I stay up until bedtime). I don’t have an interest in anything. I get angry, irritated very easily.

Antidepressants do not work for me, and I am not going to go back and try them. 

I want to get off the Klonopin because I’m sick of feeling like a zombie. 

Anyone ONLY on benzos experience depression, anger, exhaustion as a side effect?

I’m an intelligent 41 year old woman, I know I can’t just stop taking medication. I weaned before. This isn’t about that. 

In my post in the other group the two responses were focused more on the dosage I was prescribed (even though I said I only take 2mg per day) and that I could have seizures and my doctor could lose his license and then I won’t have the pills blah blah blah. 

(I had three separate doctors prescribe this to me so it’s not illegal or anything where I live). 

I want to know if anyone else become depressed BECAUSE of benzos and once you got off you were better. 

I believe the Klonopin is causing my depression and anger. I am going to be weaning off them, I just want to know if anyone else has gotten off benzos and their depression/anger went away.

I’m at the end of my rope here. This isn’t living.

EDITED TO ADD : I don’t drink alcohol or do any drugs except I consume THC and CBD and I use psychedelics 2-3 times a year. 

Thank you for the responses and you’ve given me hope that I will feel better once I get the Klonopin out of my system, however long that will take.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8486657}"

As a teen i was suffering from anxiety and panic attacks, and was terrified pretty regularly. Went to the doc, prescribed me paxil, which seemed to really help for a few months to a year, until the anxiety came back. Returned to the doc, who then prescribed me 2mg xanax per day. Felt like a miracle, all my anxiety was gone and felt fantastic. Jumping forward to 3 months ago, when I went into the hospital for medical supervised detox because I had run out of xans 2 weeks early. Started a taper of librium, starting at 25mg in the hospital and for a week after, and reducing by about 5mg per week. Now that I'm down to 5mg per day, having severe anxiety and depression every day and am basically unable to function. Calling off work, staying in bed pretty much all day, and avoiding all social interactions as much as possible. Is this taper too fast? Doctor is pushing me to jump off, but I don't feel comfortable yet. Not sure if I'm ready, I want to be off but I want to make sure it's successful. Think this depression and anxiety is par for the course or from tapering too quickly? Will I be better off starting a slower taper or from eventually being off benzos?

If you make it to the end, thanks for reading. 


Well folks, its time for me to face the past, and present.  Some of this may seem unbelievable, dont worry i won't be offended if some don't belive my story, in this post, or later posts. If I had told myself what  was gonna happen, and what I would go through , about 6 years ago, I wouldn't have believed me, either. 


6 years ago: I had been abusing various prescription drugs; Various  Benzos, (Xanax, Clonazepam, ambien, Adderall, Ritalin. Some street drugs too; Morphine. Also that over-the- counter, devious bastard, Phenibut. 

 For the most part my Drug abuse had taken place over 3 years. I would rotate drugs, or use drugs to withdraw from other drugs, so everything was off and on. Toward the end of the 1st year, I heavily escalated my Phenibut dosage, over the course 
Of a month. At the end of that month I quit and went through some pretty bad Withdrawlas. I tried mitigating the Withdrawlas  by Drinking a bottle of wine, which helped a little. This was my first withdrawal experience. 

I of course didn't learn from this experience, and some time later, went through Ambien Withdrawls. I was awake, anxious and strung out, for 2 days straight. Until I had my then girlfriend, intravenously inject me with Promethazine which knocked me out. 

A couple months later I went through xanax (I think?) Withdrawlas at work. I took a 15 minute break, drove to the liquor store, bought and chugged some Everclear, and went back to work. 

Toward the end of 3 years, I was rotating Ambien, Xanax, Clonzapam, Phenibut. The drugs had wiped my memory, and I was an idiot, so I thought I could quit everything by a 5 day taper of Xanax. On the last day of my ""taper"", i shoplifted 4-5 energy drink shots, pounded them, and went for a run.  Que massive panic attack. I tried to overcome it using relaxation techniques, but it was too much. While the panic attack was rocking my world, it left me with the feeling, deep in the core of my being , that nothing would ever be ok again. 

A couple hospital visits later, some Ambien, Clonazepam and wine, and I decided to cold Turkey, or die trying. Oh, also a meth and Adderal  Binge, that ended with me thinking the Earth was under attack from light aliens, (the lights from Various Poles). I could see the light beings fighting against government on a distant hill.  

During this period of quitting, I  went through several, the best i can describe, seizures. One involved me sitting down in my parents front yard, ( I had moved back home amidst all the confusion in my life) as shock waves of stress, and terror, ripped through my body. I was confused, and didn't understand what was going on. I remember seeing the air waving, and undulating , with fear and terror.  

With the final fatal resolution of a lemming , I quit everything.  Had a cerebral seizure, and laid down to die, I knew this was the end. My whole existence became a point of white light in my brain (I know, how cliche), and I told God I was sorry, and he could have my life. 


Eventually I came to my body, feeling like a newborn baby, absolutely helpless. Some part of me realized a good portion of my memory had just been wiped out, and I would have to re-learn a lot of things. 

After this I tried regrouping my life, started reading the Bible which helped, but the months of anxiety , fear,  confusion (at this point I didn't really Remember what had happened, I just knew something really bad had happened)  were too much and I had a mental breakdown.  I quit working l because I was too afraid of having a terrible panic attack at work. 

Off to rehab.  The sudden relocation, unfamiliar environment and people, brought on a lot more side effects, fear, and confusion, and I planned on killing myself by running into the Ocean and Drowning Myself.

 While attending a Church in the rehab, I gave my life to Jesus. Later at the same church, while listening and singing to worship music,   I had an experience with God where he lifted everything all the stress, fear, and intrusive thoughts off of me, and I felt an all encompassing love and Peace. The peace in my heart was astounding, and impossible to explain, and though I would still go through a lot of things mentally, and physically, the peace remained for several years. I would have killed myself had God not intervened. 

After 5 months in Rehab, I escaped one night, and purchased a grey hound bus ticket home.  

I'm back home, and able to work, thank God. Ive been through a lot, and am still recovering physically from what I went through, though things have gotten immensely better. I would say 95% of my memory is back, it took almost 5 years, to get the healing. My body still goes though up and downs, and I still experience times of stress, and anxiety, and traumatic memories  and emotions, that I surpessed to get through. 

If you made it This far in reading, thanks!  I understand everybody doesn't believe in God, or believes in a different spiritual reality , but I cant tell my story without involving God, it wouldn't be true or authentic if I did. 

This is just quick write up, I left a lot out, and there's gaps, because I just wanted to finally get everything out. My family was very little help, when I was going through the worst of it all, I tried explaining that I was going through benzo withdrawals , and they ignored me, or told me I was making it up.

Trying to keep my mind occupied and not overly focused on my mental health is difficult, as I work in the mental health field. I find myself hypervigilant to the point (today) of paranoia, depersonalization, just second guessing everything I think and do.

I'm curious what others do in this situation. I am at work and feel so odd and uncomfortable. Staying home seems like a cop-out. I'm trying to act normal and probably am. I just feel so strange and incredibly self-conscious. At home, I sometimes try and find things to make me laugh to jolt me out of this, but at work, it's a bit harder.

I went to the doctor a few months ago because I had a bad experience while flying. I told her I had some anxiety around flying and she prescribed me 0.25mg tablet of Lorazepam for anxiety. I was told to take a quarter tablet if I felt anxious to help me relax. I am generally healthy but during Monday morning I felt like I couldn't breathe and started panicking. I decided to take a quarter dose of the tablet and felt really dizzy afterwards but it wore off and I got on with my work. The next day I started getting anxious again and decided to take another quarter dose. The following day I felt fine but the next few days I had trouble sleeping. I kept having a sharp pain from muscle tension in my back and felt like band was strapped around my chest and I could take a deep breath. I decided then to take another dose to help me relax and go to sleep. The next few days everytime I went to sleep I had the same symptoms and kept having to take Lorazepam to sleep and eventually had to take half a tablet to sleep. The next day I felt like I couldn't breathe and called my doctor about taking the medication and she told me to stop taking it immediately as I wasn't supposed to be taking it daily. The next few days were rough and I had trouble trying to fall asleep. I told my doctor about it and she said that it should be out of the system by now but I never had these problems before taking the medication. I read up on the withdrawal symptoms and felt like I was having increased anxiety and panic preventing me from sleeping. It's been a few months since I stopped taking the medication but I feel like I have been having more instances of anxiety and pain associated with stress and anxiety than before I was taking the medication and now things that didn't typically bug me I have anxiety about. I know it wasn't for a long time and that at such a small dose I really shouldn't be having these problems but I felt like this has impacted me somehow and was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6597918}"

&#x200B;

After alternating between Circadin, Apodorm, Quetiapine and Zolpidem\\Ambien for over three years my physical and mental health is pretty ruined. I did not take doses higher than reccomended, however after 8 months of taking mostly Zolpidem and some Circadin I almost went completely insane. The fact that I have schizophrenia in my family may have been a contributing factor, as such, I obviously shouldn't have taken these pills for long term, yet somehow they subtly warped my judgement completely. These pills are truly the Devil.

I've been completely drug free for 4 weeks now, the worst discomfort seem to be over but I still struggle with following:

\-Chronic pain and stiffness in neck, shoulders and arms. At some point it was so bad I thought my neck had prolapsed. I got a scan of the area and it showed nothing unusual. I got full mobility and the location of the pain varies so it's most likely nothing physical. 

\-Mood swings, this is slightly better now.

\-Extreme clumsiness\\bad coordination. I broken so many things.

\-Memory, concentration and motivation is messed up.

\-Digestion is messed up, I've been vomiting every day since April last year. No matter what I eat, my system can't handle it.

\-Increased appetite and cravings for sweet stuff, not a good combination when digestion doesnt work.

&#x200B;

About 2 months ago, the pain was at an all time high and I could not do anything but suffer and contemplate. I tried ever medical options I could find to no help. I decided I had to either quit the drugs or kill myself. I've tapered off for 3 weeks, and now I am on 4 weeks  completly drugfree.

 I'm asking myself how I let this poisoning go on for so long, it was like I was another person with zero judgement. I've always been careful with what I put in my body but for some reason the warnings about side effects just didn't register. I just hope that I have not fucked up my system permantently, and thats why I posted this here.

I'm qurious if anyone else had similar effects and how long they lasted after quitting. Perhaps any tips to speed up the healing process. I tried googling this but there's so much useless info, I rather hear from first hand experiencers.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8740424}"

I'm a male, 24 years old, 5ft9 and 75 kgs. For the past months I've been tapering diazepam. In December, I took a break at 8 mgs. One week ago, my regular dose felt way more sedating than usual, and by now I even feel sedated if I take 4 mg a day. I'm not sure what has caused this sudden increase in perceived sedation from diazepam, and am scared to decrease my dose too quickly. Conversely, I don't want to feel the effects as I want to taper down and get of this drug, so I don't want my dose to be too high either. I would really appreciate any insights or help. Thank you all so much. Some more information below.

I was diagnosed with heart disease 1,5 years ago. For the last 6 months, i've taken the exact same drugs/supplements:

* Nicorandil 20mg x2 daily
* Ranolazine (Ranexa) 500mg x2 daily
* Bisoprolol 2,5mg x2 daily
* Omega 3 fish oil x 2 daily
* Vitamin A, B, C, E supplement x 1 daily
* N-acetylcysteine 600mg x2 daily
* Magnesium malate 2000 mg daily
* I do not drink grapefruit juice.
* Slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST = 46, ALT = 160, was told this was mild elevation and would not have any effect on drug metabolism)

Aside from these drugs/supplements, i was prescribed 2mg Xanax daily 1,5 years ago as they suspected my symptoms were due to a panic disorder. As soon as it was clear that it was heart disease, i started a taper to get off Xanax. Over the course of 5 months i gradually tapered down from 2 mg's xanax daily to 1 mg. At that point, i was switched from 1mg xanax to 8mg diazepam over the course of 1 month (November). I tolerated the switch without any problems other than ringing ears. In december I was on 8 mg diazepam daily (4x2mg every 6 hours) without tapering down, to adjust to the diazepam. I take my medication on a fixed schedule. I'm 100% positive i never miss a dose or take a dose twice, as i prepare my doses for a few days at a time. I do not drink any alcohol, soft drink and i do not smoke.

In the first 4 weeks of 8mg diazepam daily and no more xanax, everything felt pretty stable, with some mild withdrawal symptoms but overall far better compared to xanax alone. One week ago, out of the blue, I felt extremely sedated by the exact same doses i was taking before. Nothing has changed regarding my diet, medication, lifestyle,..

My main concern is obviously that i don't want to go backwards in my taper. However, I do not understand what would cause me to feel this sedated while nothing has changed.

Thank you.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.472144}"

Down to 10 mg a day of valium now, after first being introduced to Xanax well over six miserable years ago. Depression and anxiety are through the roof, will be looking at my vitamins and supplements but I know this is normal. Still off the booze so I suppose my brain is in overdrive. I can't stop but look back and think of how messed up I have been, and feel like a complete failure as an adult. 

I am doing group therapy but it is not a 12 step program and I haven't been to a meeting in years. Thinking about hitting them up atm, anxiety through the roof makes leaving my place a daunting experience.

Thinking about rehab with a CBT approach rather than the 12 steps. Just wondered if anyone else here had done a longer rehab and how they found it? I realise my depression is a lot worse than I imagined and I have to be fully clean and have no benzos in the system till I can go in. 

What is to be expected? Any stories here would be very welcome right now. Thank you in advance.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8597606}"

The summer was hellish. I somehow escaped seizures I think probably because I have my medical marijuana card and stayed pretty medicated with Indica and CBD but had and still have many symptoms although I am markedly better and improving in big brain ways every day.

It’s true, after 9 months I can finally feel my brain working hard to work hard. Sometimes it aches because of how hard it’s remapping is working. I love to stand under a hot shower and let the water run over my head. 

I’ve had muscle weakness, blurred vision. My left eye has been especially damaged, it leaks, is very light and dark sensitive and I’ve noticed in photographs it’s squinty like it wasn’t before the jump off benzos. Nausea, spinning, and for me one of the worse things intrusive memory...I can’t even explain that right now but I will say it’s finally quieting down and I feel like I am doing some major healing now. 

The New Year and new decade are ominous with all that space to fill up living. But for the first time in months I can say I’m glad I made the choice to actually feel my life and get the hell off of those drugs.
