Few weeks? I don't know I ate a month's script (90 mgs) and then some because I didn't always take the full dose so 100+ mgs of Xanax, in 10 or so days after nervous breakdown. 

I made it 3 days before going to the ER which was an absolute nightmare and one of the worst things that I've ever experienced. Not the ER, they were nice, the withdrawal. They gave me a Librium taper. I want to stop the Xanax, I never told my psychiatrist she has weapon's grade incompetence and I just wanted to be done with her honestly. 

But my God. 

I'm down to my last 2 Librium capsules and the mental toll between doses is borderline unbearable. I'm worried this taper was too quick. Thankfully I'm on a leave from work though I was *really* showing out before and am honestly lucky to still even have a job. The shame and humiliation of that situation on top of this is absolutely destroying me. I have cried all day, every day, the past 3 days in absolute mental agony. 

I expected the anxiety, but I'm barely clinging on with this depression. I hardly eat. Just lay in bed all day wanting to die. I have never experienced such a prolonged bout of depression at this caliber before. 

How does one cope with this? People tell me that I'm making the work thing out to be a bigger deal than it is but my headspace is so warped I can't hardly tell what's real life or isn't.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989838004112244}"

Went cold turkey off 2mg with an assisted NAD infusion detox. It didn’t work, and I had HORRID withdrawal (insomnia, wild akathisia, extreme anxiety, amongst many physical symptoms). I literally thought I was going to die multiple times. My psychiatrist gave me every medicine he could (besides benzos) to help me get out of the pit and stay off Ativan, but nothing really helped. So we ended up trying diazepam, and I metabolized it too quickly. So then we tried clonazepam for a short 8 days, and I don’t think I was ever on a high enough dose of it to stabilize. Anyway, We decided to quit all the meds I was on and then was in HELL for 22 days. Really really wanted to die and thought I maybe would. I ended up in the hospital more than once, and the last time they insisted I go back on Ativan and put me on 4mg. That was almost 4 weeks ago. So now I’m doing a slow taper, which is what I should have done all along. I’m already down to 3mg bc I could tell that 4 was way too much for me. My current plan is to reduce by .125 every week or two, if I can stabilize with each cut. I have a history of being very sensitive to meds, and a history of not doing well on benzos and then having a wretched time coming off. I already did my first .125 cut on Monday, and it’s now Thursday. I haven’t had any worse symptoms than I’ve already been having (interdose withdrawal or maybe just bad side effects, I’m not sure). So I’m hoping this taper rate will work well. I’d like to go down a little faster, but I’m utterly terrified of going back down into the pit. Anyone have any advice or encouragement for me? I know Ativan isn’t the easiest to come off of, so it really sucks that I can’t switch to diazepam.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992340803146362}"

Sonata seemed like one of the better choices as it was the one of the 3 I mentioned that for sure acted on the GABA receptor. Also, my Klonipin isn't coving all of my Xanax withdrawals, no 100% cross-tolerance like there is with opiates, so there is this gap that needs to be filled.

2021-04-29 14:56:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/n1be9v/tolerance_withdrawal/,Tolerance Withdrawal?,"Hi All. I have a question related to tolerance withdrawal, that infuriating alleged phenomenon whereby people on long-term benzodiazepine prescriptions can actually experience withdrawal without actually tapering or going off their dose. I have chronic fatigue syndrome, and have been prescribed .5mg Clonozapem for several years. Last year, after a new GP refused to pick up my longstanding prescription, I tried tapering off the medication. Long story short, three weeks into being completely off the med, my body slipped into a profoundly enfeebled state in which I could barely function, much less work consistently. After 3-4 weeks of being off my dose, I went back on at .25mg. And when things were only around 50% better, I returned to my original, longstanding dose of .5mg. After that, things seemed to stabilize for the most part. 

But earlier this year—around 8-10 months after going back on the medication—I noticed myself experiencing a lot of new symptoms: worsened brain fog, worsened memory and cognition issues, mood disturbances, mild depression, mild derealization, reduced appetite, and even intermittent dizziness/lightheadedness and brief snatches of anxiety (which is extremely unusual for me).

Hopefully this will help reassure someone that it's possible to come off of massive doses. 

Today I'm finished with 6 week stay in inpatient treatment to get off of benzos. Ideally I'd have finished my taper at home, but because of drug supply chains getting fucked up from covid, I ran out of benzos half of the way through my taper and didn't have any choice but to go be honest with the doctors about the position I was in. Given that I'd been taking 7 mg a day of an RC benzo, flualprazolam, for the past year, which 2x the strength of xanax, the only way they'd be willing to work with me is if I did inpatient for the remainder of the taper. It actually went surprisingly well. When I went in they'd switched to the equivalent dose of Ativan for where I was at with my taper, 12mg. 

Honestly I went through the worst part of it during the initial stages of the taper when I was still at home. One of the shittiest parts was when I knew I was going to run out of benzos. I'd had a two week supply left and I had to figure out what the fuck I was gonna do to make sure I didn't go into real fucking bad withdrawals. There's a language barrier where I'm living, and people don't do drugs here like back in the US, so the doctors had no idea what RC benzos were and had never seen anyone who'd taken more than 6mg of Ativan. 

Because of that, I had a really hard time convincing them that I was indeed taking as massive of a dose as I was. They'd set me up with a bed for 3 weeks out, which was an issue since they were very hesitant to prescribe me anything for the week gap of when I'd be out of benzos. I had to go to a couple different doctors before I could find someone willing to work with me. It also doesn't help that doctors here aren't willing to prescribe anything stronger than Ativan, and the pharmacies here don't dispense medication like in the US where pharmacists count out meds and give them to you in an orange bottle. Everything comes in prepackaged boxes, and the highest amount of Ativan they have is a 50 pack of 1mg tablets. I think the fact that the doctor would have to write me scripts every four days for a medication that's highly frowned upon to prescribe in low doses, nevermind the dose I was at, created a kind of mental barrier that they didn't want to deal with. The doctor I was able to get to help me was also kinda shitty to work with because everytime I'd see him, he'd completely forget what my situation was and why I needed high doses. He also forgot put me in the system to get into the clinic for inpatient, so my 1 week gap turned into a 2 week gap.

The uncertainty of the whole situation and continually running into walls when I was trying to get help before I ran out was really fucking shitty and stressful. That being said, I know I was asking a lot of these people when I'd dug myself into this hole. So I guess I can't be that upset.

Once I got into the clinic, everything went way way smoother. The doctors and nurses were fantastic and the whole environment was really chill. The clinics for psych stuff here are way more relaxed than what the US has to offer. I'd never been in a position where I'd need that type of treatment when I was living in the US, but I had friends who had to go into for suicide attempts and breakdowns, and I remember when I'd visited them it felt like the ward they were in a prison because of the general environment and restrictions on what they could do. I was able to stay in an open ward where I could come and go, you can keep all your shit on you and don't have to hand over your phone or shoelaces, and the rooms felt more like a hotel room than anything else. There were also a bunch of different types of therapy. 

I guess being able to go outside during this wasn't really an issue in terms of being tempted to relapse since I'd completely went through my supply of benzos, and you can't find benzos on the street here. Or any prescription drugs for that matter. The hospital is also on the hedge of a huge forest, so that gave me somewhere to explore that wasn't affected by the covid lockdown.

It took me 4 weeks in the clinic to come off the remaining 12 mg of Ativan, then I spent another 2 weeks adjusting to being off of them. Honestly I have no idea why I didn't have very many issues coming off such a high dose. We'd made a schedule for my taper that could be adjusted as necessary if the withdrawals were too much, but I never had to take more time than planned for any of the reductions. If I had to guess, I'd imagine the stress-free environment helped a lot. It kinda makes me think that the anxiety you feel during benzos withdrawals essentially just amplifies any other environmental stress you're dealing with, and if you don't have much environmental stress, there's nothing to really amplify.

The only really stressors were when my ex hit me up to talk. Trying to deal with the really messy breakup with her was one of the major factors that caused me to start using benzos in the first place. Also it didn't that the university hospital my clinic is at is the same area of the university hospital that I'm doing grad school at. During normal times I'm here every day to work in research labs, so a lot of the doctors here are my colleagues. Luckily none of the doctors on my ward were involved in research what so ever.

I was actually super fucking hesitant at first to go here for treatment due to the obvious uncomfortableness that I'd be going through one of the shittiest experiences in my life in what was essentially my work place. It really bothered me at first before I'd come in. But I guess eventually I got so pissed off about my struggles to stop using this stuff, and the continuous barriers I was running into trying to get help from doctors, that I just stopped giving a fuck about it. I did run into colleagues a few times, but I just made up some bullshit about what I was doing here. Usually that I was there for a meeting or something. I do have colleagues who are close friends who I told everything, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the stigma about this kind of stuff when it came to interacting with other colleagues.

So that's my story, or at least the most recent part of it I guess. Hopefully some people will see this and feel encouraged that they can make it off of this stuff. I'm nervous about going home and not having the same structure as I do here, but I've lined up my schedule with meeting with friends and seeing my therapist. So hopefully that helps some. I really haven't had major cravings for benzos yet. I'm interested to see if that's still the case when I go back to the environments I associate with using them. I'm planning on moving apartments in the next month so I can feel like I've closed this chapter of my life.",8,"{'covid': 2, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9941548705101013}"

I had abused pregabalin and diazepam I'm 3 weeks clean from pregab in stupid doses.
 I'd been taking about 10-20mg of diazepam 5mg every monday n Friday for a year on and off. It's only by getting off these drugs that I've seen most of my illness and anxieties have been inter dose polydrug withdrawl.

My current symptoms are major panic attack on waking (trying to push through with panic meditations and keeping busy) this lasts an hour or so. I have a very active nearly two year old and I have a meeting today to be back at work tomorrow.
 I've been on bezo buddies and I tried to read through the success stories. I dont wanna cave and ask for small amounts of diazepam because yes it will immediately alleviate my symptoms and make me feel better. I'm guna try make it to 3 months off and update. On my doses and not every day abuse. My withdrawls aren't unmanageable but because I have stopped two difficult drugs I just wondered if anyone had a timescale I could give myself to compare to. I've dropped 2 stone in three weeks and still struggling to eat anything other than complan until an evening. Should I just stay strong and power through. I know going back on benzos will be an 'instant cure' but I want to know I'm strong enough to manage panic and anxiety with just my sertraline (taken from a young age due to lots of trauma) 
 From the outside world I've got a little house, my husband, my children a job I like although not the best pay. I just want to be able to enjoy life again, this combination of drugs ruined my life. I didnt even realise i was a completely different person for a whole year, taking risks, constantly exhausted wanting to just sleep all the time. Was just a huge depressive episode over the full year. This last three weeks has been had but the first 10 days ct off pregabalin was much more severe than this. I can function and get out of bed so surely I must be healing?

I'm looking to taper from 15mg nightly Oxazepam for 3 months. I'm aware that the benzo I'm taking isn't as strong as many of the other benzos and that it's a relatively low dose, but I still want to do a slow taper in order to avoid possible rebound insomnia and anxiety. The antidepressant I've been taking (Effexor) has been working well to decrease my anxiety, and I would like to keep it that way. I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow and I'm thinking about bringing up to her one of the following options:

* Outright halve the dose in the first week and go from there (keep halving the dose each week). Last time I tried to do that I was unable to get to sleep (I cut half of the pill, was unable to get to sleep for 3 hours, and had to take the full pill in order to finally get some sleep). With those factors in mind, I'm looking to avoid this option as much as possible (that taper is probably too fast to avoid WD symptoms and I'm trying to minimize those as much as possible).
* Cut 1-2mg from the pill each week. I doubt I'll be able to do that though because only 15mg Oxazepam pills are sold in my country and they only have one score halfway, so I don't think it's feasible to cut 1-2mg from these pills.
* Folllow the Ashton Manual and ask the GP to switch me to Diazepam and do a very slow taper by cutting 1mg from the Diazepam every two weeks. The first week I would halve the Oxazepam pill and take it alongside 12mg Diazepam and on the second week I would stop the Oxazepam altogether and take 15mg Diazepam to compensate for that, and start taking 1mg off the Diazepam every one to two weeks. That would be a very very very slow taper (3 to 6 months), but I'm more inclined towards this option given that it's very likely to not give me WD symptoms and it allows me to have some kind of fallback in case some stressful or anxiety inducing event comes up and disrupts my night sleep. The only problem I see with this option is that perhaps my relatively low Oxazepam dosage and time I have taken it doesn't justify such a slow tapering process, and I don't know if my GP is willing to follow this plan. I feel that bringing up an entirely personalized taper plan of my own would be too awkward.

I'm looking for opinions on what I should do and how should I bring this up to my GP. I'm only trying to minimize the chances of rebound insomnia as much as possible while following a slow tapering plan. I'm really not looking forward to sleeping little to no time and be dominated by anxiety and intrusive thoughts all night long again, but I also don't want to sound pretentious or come off as somebody who thinks he knows more than the doctor.

Clean for 8 months now! Tapered way to quicly after years of on and off benzo but mainly ambien usage prescribed by my doc.

The first six months were by far the hardest I’ve ever gone through in my life. I can honestly say I would rather have had cancer with a 50/50 chance of surviving or break all bones in my body.

I went through severe mind terror daily, incredibly tired, sick, dizzy, tinnitus, could not walk straight/balance problems, agoraphobia, fucked up sleep, incredibly painfull legs each day, severe depression, blurry vision, heart palpitations and suicide ideation. Brutal to say the least.

For 6 months I could not read a book, watch tv, game, or have a conversation with somebody without having a really painfull and awful feeling in my brain and eyes making me flee to my dark room.

I have numerous doctors in my family and they all thought I was crazy/overreacting. Literally no support besides a bit from my father but he doesnt believe I am currently experiencing paws.

I started to improve by month 7 though! 
The brainfog became a bit less and I was able to focus a bit better and even watch tv! Huge victory! 

Since the beginning of the 8th month I can even play some videogames again! Feels amazing! 

I still have a long way to go however but I am thankful for at least getting some skills back. 

This entire ordeal gave a huge blow to my self-confidence however. Always used to be a confident and outgoing type, not anymore though. Hope it will come back.

Things that are remaining in the 8th month:

a low baselevel of anxiety, some fatigue, bad sleep, less agoraphobia but scared to go on long drives and concentration problems. Tinnitus is still there but less than before. When I don’t rest enough I completely crash and end up in horrible waves with severe heart palpitations and a pulsating body for numerous hourse. I became extremely sensitive to stress.

I am not complaining though. I can notice progression which is the most important thing! 

Things that helped me get through the worst of it:

Meditation, walking daily (even if you can’t), eating okayish and this sub! I avoided the fearmongers on facebook etc. I also keep a logbook of symptoms and rate them so I can track my progression. 

Only subs I use are Omega 3, vita D/B and a strong multivitamin.

WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE WILL HEAL!

I'm new here but not new to etizolam. Back in 2014 I was prescribed valium, 2mg AM and 4mg PM. It was for back pain. I never took it daily (afraid of dependency) and instead took 10mg once or twice per week when my back pain was really high. I can't really remember when I stopped refilling the valium and switched to etizolam, but it happened. For a long time I had a strict rule of 2 days in between doses. I never dose more than once per day (not now, not ever). It's not recreational for me. My dad passed away about a year ago and I started having more painful nights. I know it was physical manifestations of grief. At the time I thought... whatever. I function fine during the day, I'll just take this stuff at night to help me sleep. I've done that for about a year. It's slowly increased from once every 2-3 nights to pretty much every night. I don't always take 5mg, sometimes just 4. Anyways, with the export ban I became acutely aware of how much I have remaining and decided I want to be done. It's not recreational for me, I don't really get a buzz, it's not fixing my back pain, so I want to get off.
About 5 days ago I decided to start a taper. At first I skipped a night. I felt jittery the next day so I decided to keep my schedule the same and focus on reducing the dose. 
I took 4mg per night for 2 nights, and 3mg per night for the last 2 nights. So I'm down from 5mg to 3. I'm thinking that I'll keep my doses the same during the work week (I absolutely must be totally functional at work) and reduce by a mg on Friday nights.

2021-04-27 13:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/mzttm0/quick_tips_during_withdrawal/,Quick tips during withdrawal,"Hey guys. I’m about 3 1/2 months into this benzo withdrawal journey. As we all know, it’s something straight from the pits if hell. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. But 3 1/2 months ago I didn’t think I’d be alive at this point because of my dependency to Klonopin - that’s how terrified I was. 

Just a quick rundown of my story (more in depth story in my post history). 

Prescribed .25mg/twice a day Xanax in late 2017, October I think. Over the next 4 years that would escalate to 2mg/twice a day Klonopin. 

Now I wasn’t taking them everyday but I was taking atleast 12mg a WEEK at my peak. I had 2mg tablets and would just randomly take 2 or 3 tablets during the week but I was taking 2 tablets every Saturday and Sunday minimum. 

Jan 2021 i decided to try and come off. I didn’t know what I was doing and tried to CT. It was disastrous. I’m surprised I didn’t end up in the hospital. I lost 25lbs because I couldn’t eat solid food nor sleep more than an hour or two each night after a few days. I developed pretty bad symptoms. I wised up a bit and started a taper. 

I’ll save the symptom list for another post. 

Just want to share a few things that have helped me during this taper. 

**1) Acceptance**. At the beginning I was beating myself up everyday (mentally) because I could not come to grips with my situation. I would cry every single morning. I’d cry on my lunch break. I’d cry after work - and multiple times a day on the weekends. Because I felt incredibly stupid apart from being terrified. I just learned to accept that I’m in this situation and it is ‘temporary’. No matter what my mind tells me.  I felt guilty for letting myself get to this point, but that doesn't matter anymore.  We're here now and need to deal with what's in front of us.  The past will only burden us.

**2) Avoiding horror stories**. Naturally, when this all started and I didn’t know what was happening to me, I started googling and YouTubing anything benzo related. I found good info but I also found horror stories. They just made me feel worse. Like “that’s what’s waiting for me”. They add to the negativity that we’re already facing. Yes it’s good to understand what could happen, but they only made me feel worse. I actively avoid them. Not only did the risk of severe symptoms scare the hell out of me, there's people who post about having PAWS for years on end.  I didn't need to hear that when I first started tapering.  Your story isn't there's.  Yes it might take some time to get better but there's no amount of worrying/panic that will shorten it.

**3) Most doctors don’t understand benzo withdrawal**. I asked multiple doctors and they either avoided it or gave a watered down answer like taper it - without giving a solid plan (thanks). Don’t get discouraged by that. There’s plenty of videos showing different tapering methods.  The best thing would be to not even mention a taper or anything, you need the supply. Unless you have a compassionate doctor who listens to you. Mine didn’t so I had to scramble and find a different one who didn’t understand benzo withdrawal but he did recognize that I needed a prescription.  My recommendation is not to freak out at a doctor over this, if you can help it.  You need to take control of the situation, as hard as it is and try to get a steady supply to taper.

**4) Look for support**. This is a must. No one understands what you’re going through. Only those that have been through it. But if you have family, friends, even online platforms - utilize them. You’re going to need them to tell you that you’ll be okay. Plenty of mornings I felt like I wasn’t going to survive. I thought for sure I was dying. Reassurance goes a hell of a long way in withdrawal. My wife or parents telling me that I was going to be okay meant I had a bit of confidence for a little while.  It's hard as hell trying to get through this without anyone to lean on.  You need to be able to tell someone, anyone, what's going on and how you're feeling.  Hell, even message me if you have no one else. I feel like I can make decent conversation. 

**5) Understand that you aren’t your symptoms**. I developed lots of symptoms from this whole situation. I still suffer them and will suffer them for a while. I let my symptoms dictate me in a way that made me believe I’d never be normal again. The right mindset to have is “Yes, I am experiencing scary symptoms but they are temporary. They do not define me”. Many symptoms had my wife contemplating taking me to an ER. Because we didn’t know what was going on. Now I have a better understanding of benzo withdrawal and see that some of these symptoms are a normal part of it. Understand that they will go away in time. You will be your old self, who you were before the meds. The symptoms will subside over time.

**6) It can be a rollercoaster**. At least it has been for me. Some days I’m “okay”. Other days I’m not. I’ve cried more tears during this withdrawal than any other period of my life. From the morning terror, to some other freak symptom, I breakdown. But that’s part of it. Our brains are repairing themselves so we’re going to feel weird sometimes. I’ve had fits of rage, insomnia, manic episodes, downright insanity at first, but things seemed to level out somewhat when I steadied my dose. Not saying I feel good, but I feel better than I did at the start. That gives me hope for the future. 

**7) Keep a journal**. Write down what you’re feeling. Write down what you’re grateful for. Write down your goals and a small message to yourself a week from now. Just spill your thoughts onto it. It helps me track things like how I’ve been feeling and motivates me. Because that’s what we need. Motivation. Benzo withdrawal is a monster but we can get through it. 

**8) Exercise**. Some days I can’t muster up the strength to walk for 5 minutes. I get it. But when I drag my ass into the gym to do a light workout, I feel much better for a while. It’s the mixture of distraction (because I’m thinking about withdrawal all day) and physical exertion. Our body was made to move. I feel like even worse shit when I spend my days sitting down and laying down all day. A brisk walk, light weight lifting, whatever - just something that will get you moving. Headphones, good music and some movement will make you feel better and possibly sleep better.  Endorphins are the MVP of helping you feel good. Don’t feel bad if you can’t do much at first - go slow. Withdrawal robs all of our energy from us. 

**9) People have recovered. You need to maintain the same hope for yourself.**

I’m still tapering. I believe I’m at 0.8mg Klonopin a day now. It’s hard to tell because I’m dry cutting but it’s somewhere around there. I’m cutting 5-10% of the weight of the tablet every 2-3 weeks. I’m not symptom-free, I have some hard symptoms but I’m still somewhat functional so that’s better than nothing.

Whenever I would try tapering before, the insomnia would be back within days and I'd go right back to 1-2mg. I'm happy to say I'll never take 2 half mg pills again. Never again. I've cut out an entire half of a pill! I feel like I'm getting a little sliver of my brain back to myself each cut I make. 

Those of you that were on 1mg of Klonopin for about a year, or something similar, was there a point where it became difficult? How quickly did you come off, and were there long term effects? Am I doing this right by cutting 10% every two weeks? Although I'm happy to be doing it, it is kind of intimidating.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931574463844299}"

He has been taking high dose Xanax for almost 30(!) years. He’s now beginning detox in a treatment center.,"He is an incredibly anxious person. He’s also a hypochondriac. I guess with age he has been going downhill for awhile ie more anxiety, insomnia, and more scarily, confusion, forgetfulness, and some paranoia. After multiple trips to the ER in a week, his wife and he decided that he needs help. 

After a false start at one treatment center that wasn’t a good match, he’s been transferred to a more medicalised one. He has been placed on a Librium taper. Is that a common treatment? One benzo replaced by another?

Sorry I just needed to vent a bit. It’s been so scary. We are all feeling so guilty that we didn’t know how bad things were becoming. Has anyone here stopped taking Xanax or has heard of someone stopping after such a long dependence on it?

Yayyy! 

All was well and good, riding high on life, until I had a crazy panic attack in December (never, ever had a physical panic attack before, ever). Things returned back to my new normal within a couple of weeks. 

Recently, my ENT prescribed a low dose of Valium taken at bedtime 1/day for 7 days to help relax my jaw at night. It didn’t click that the muscle relaxer he prescribed was a benzo until after the course of treatment when I began to experience a panic attack with withdrawal symptoms: minor hyperventilation, + delusional anxiety about a mold in my home situation which triggered a major depressive episode (my doctor declared me as in remission from depression a few months ago). 

Of course, I attributed my recent episode to the Valium + PAWS and felt so much better after making the connection. But my psych isn’t convinced the Valium had anything to do with anything. 

Thoughts, anyone? Anyone experienced withdrawal symptoms after introducing a benzo, taken for a short amount of time, once tapered from klonopin?

I come from Chile but moved to Berlin, Germany, back in 2016.  
Back in 2013 i had a huge traumatic episode because of a sudden breakup with a girlfriend that used to be my friend for 12 years, ended up with a depression and Insomnia. 

My mom back then decided , instead of bringing me to therapy, to make an appointment with the neurologist (to give treatment to the insomnia) , which is basically why i became addicted.  

Back on those years and till today, in Chile as in many other countries in North, central and south america doctors give benzos like candies.  
Started taking 0,5 clonazepam and today i take 3mg  every night to sleep.  
With the help of my psychiatrist i have tried 3 or 4 times to decrease the dosis 0,5mg per month with a side medication that makes me sleepy, so i can actually rest.  
Now, after 8 years, my sleep quality is the worse it has ever been.  

Regarding my daily life... this has affected the ways i had relationships with other human beings...being mostly because im always tired and i have mood changes, but also, that i cant sleep overnight with someone on the side, as i wake up with every little movement.  

As side medications to sleep i have been taking this past 5-6 years between Seroquel (quetiapine) and Surmontil ( Trimipramine)  
Nowadays i interval between them every 1 or 2 months, as im loosing effect on both of them and i have increased the dose as well, on both of them.  
Today, im taking 125mg of quetiapine on the side of the 3mg of clonazepam, but is not helping anymore, neither the 125mg of trimipramine.  


So i have decided to give it a change once again to withdrawal the benzos and i have made an appointment at Charite ( Psychiatric clinic in Berlin) to Withdrawal them and its on 11th of May.
I came to the point where i dont enjoy living anymore, where i function at a 20% instead of at least a 60% as i used to function all these years. 
I look tired everyday and my libido is on the floor.

I have been physically active since im 20 and the past years i have been mostly doing powerlifting and strength sports but my recovery is trash, i even got injured, cause my sleeping structure does not feel appropriate.

I wanted to ask you about how to proceed now, as my psychiatrist said hes got ""out of ideas"".
I read that some of you recommend Pregabalin as a side medication to withdrawal Clonazepam, but also, to do it regarding ""the Ashton Manual"".
The ashton manual recommends to distrubute the dosis 3 times daily but ive been taking the 3mgs before going to bed all these years.

Also, if i do it as ""the Ashton Manual"" says, it would take me up to 6 months to get rid of the benzo instead of 2 weeks being inside of the clinic.

Once i came to the point of reducing till 0,5mg, but, because of my unstable life back then as an immigrant in Berlin, i had to higher the dose as i needed to properly function during the day.

I would really appreciate feedback from you, as at the moment im living hell and i needed to make a post here as ive recently discovered this community.

I worked my way up to 3 mg per day within a couple of years. I took 3 mg DAILY for 5 or 6 years...Or 7..idk🤷🏼‍♀️!! But I was prescribed 4mg daily as needed from a psychiatrist !! I literally only went there for the meds!! I’m sure he knew that Bc I would go every six months and he would ask how I was. I’d say fine and blah blah blah !! Then 5 mins later he would give me a 6 months prescription. Which is exactly what I wanted. Omg I was a fr drug seeker 😩Anyways I made myself become slow and dumb to the point of embarrassment from my time on Xanax !! And this is crazy, but I also feared being cut off, so I wanted to stop while I was in control !! Anyways, COVID gave me so much time to read and research and decide that I CAN do this !! So on July 25, 2020 I started tapering. 9 months later a bitch jumped 😄!! 

And my symptoms weren’t too awful !! Stomach pain and jumpy legs at night are literally all I’ve had !! And brain fog of course. But compared to how dumb I was while taking 3mg a day it’s NOTHING !! And I know it’s possibly gonna get worse in 3 weeks, but hopefully it won’t !! I have NOT had horror stories like I’ve read about and expected to have !! I’ll let y’all know in a month if I still feel this way 😃!!

**Edit** June 1, 2021 (a month and a week or so after original post) So it’s been a great month. I haven’t had any REAL issues. I am eating a lot and getting fat 😩, but pretty sure that’s just a personal problem 😁!! One weird thing is that I was having such stomach struggles that I made an appointment for a GI to get it checked out. It turns out I had 3 ulcers in my stomach, but they said it was due to a medication I’ve been taking for like 20 years. I ignored it for a year Bc I assumed it was from Xanax withdraws! So who knows how/if it’s tied in to the withdrawals 🤷🏼‍♀️!! Either way it’s being fixed now and I have no more stomach pain🥳 !! Overall I would say I have had ZERO w/d after jumping !! I take my Tylenol pm for sleep, but I’ve always taken something to sleep. Which is the main reason I loved Xanax to begin with!! I would say I’m back to normal (though I’ve never been truly normal 🤪) except for the memory issues. I still have short term memory problems 😩but it’s like 70-80 percent better than it was when I was taking Xanax 4 times a day !! My leg jumpy things at night time went away a couple of weeks after jumping also !! I was terrified that was going to last a long time and possibly get worse !! Hopefully I’m in the clear tho!! Bottom line is this: It CAN be an okay experience!! It wasn’t as awful as all of the stories I read about !!

Used to drink heavily and had withdrawals. Moderate ones. Quit drinking in 2019. Had two drinks again on March 7, 2020. Before this, I developed panic attacks in 2017. In 2019, I was prescribed Alprazolam 0.25mg as needed in panic episodes. I was taking them 0.25- 0.5mg once or twice a week for maybe 2 weeks max, then 0.5mg daily for about 12 days. Decided it was giving me rebound anxiety. I stopped taking it. I had major panic symptoms when I stopped. I do not know if this was psychosomatic because I was in mist of constant panic episodes and I was giving myself a complex or if I had legitimate withdrawals from the Alprazolam. I was not mentally addicted at all and that was in December 2019. I’ve managed without really well and took one random dose of Alprazolam 0.5mg for a severe panic episode on March 7, 2020 — same day I had 2 drinks. I had panic and anxiety for days and wondered if it was kindling or if I just get really wound up because I am scared of it. Haven’t drank at all and have no interest since that date. I bring drinking up because I know it affects the GABA receptors the same.


So... please don’t tease me but I have really severe dental anxiety and I haven’t gone in 12 years. I have a procedure coming up on Wednesday and they scripted me 0.25 Triazolam to take the night before and then an hour before. 
I won’t take the night time dose because I am not worried about sleeping. But I am so worried I will get withdrawal type stuff from this one dose. 
I do not worry about anything addiction related as that has not been my issue whatsoever. I just don’t want to spin out. I have deeply considered not taking sedation and suffering through the appointment but I have PTSD with being leaned over and feeling like I can’t leave and I am afraid I will panic. 

Any thoughts or advice? I know this probably sounds dumb but I filled my script weeks ago and go back and forth on which is the better of the two choices.

Tapered off of valium for a year after 8 years of being thrown on various benzo prescriptions. 
A couple days ago after having suicidal thoughts for weeks I got scared that I might do it. 
I don’t really give a shit about my life anymore, but I’m afraid if I really go through with it that my son will find out and hurt himself. He’s only 13 years old, I want to be around for him, but I’ve had chronic pain for most of his life. Two years ago he started staying with his grandmother more and more, and eventually he didn’t come back. I am devastated and in almost constant pain. I don’t sleep and I barely get out of bed. I have zero quality of life.

I told my boyfriend today that I am tired of living a life of torture, and that the er wouldn’t help and there is no place left to go. 
He thinks I should see a neurologist to try and treat my pain (stabbing earaches and charlie horse type pain in my face) Daily. For over a decade,  I also suffer with endometriosis and have had 2 surgeries for that. 

My boyfriend said that he understands why I say I want to die, he says he thinks I need to consult a neurologist and try to get a third surgery for the fibroid. That I have to exhaust all options before I resort to something drastic, but ultimately I know that my diseases are for life, and I’m essentially living in a torture chamber. He saw that there was no real help in the er, and they just wanted to get rid of me. 

When my doctors told me I was in withdrawal and cut my dose from 10.5 to 10 mg. It essentially ruined everything I was trying to do to rebuild my life. I stopped going to work and school, and my son stopped coming to see me despite daily efforts to try and talk to him. 

After the er visit I stayed with my mother so I could be close to my son, and she ended up calling me a dumbfuck and almost went to hit me so I went back home. I constantly think of ways to die and I know a prescription I can get that would help me to do that. 
My question is if you had no quality of life, and were hurting others by being alive would you eventually end it? 

I know my son and boyfriend would be devastated. I was thinking if I can find a way to make it look like an accident then they might be ok.

These aren’t really accompanied by anxious thoughts, but I’ll often feel that “pit” in your stomach that you get when you’re anxious for no reason, racing heart, etc. There isn’t really much I can do about it and sometimes it feels physically paralyzingly (like if I wake up with the feeling I can’t get out of bed). I also have an extreme sensitivity to caffeine now. I used to drink a cup of coffee every day but now if I drink any caffeine it seems to trigger the physical anxiety symptoms. 

I also have a lot of trouble sleeping now. I used to struggle with insomnia a lot, but in the past it’s always just been trouble falling asleep. Now my sleep always feels very light, and I tend to wake up in the middle of the night/early in the morning, which never used to happen.

Please tell me these symptoms are not forever, that I'll get back to more of myself eventually. I just posted here for support, really. Thanks.

What are your suggestions?
- Is replacing it partially with supplements or anxiolytic stuff like kratom a good idea?
- Would cycling with other benzos work? Or adding a long-active benzo to replace like half of the dose?
- I can ask my doc for like one good med, maybe beta blocker or gabapentin or whatever works best against anxiety.

I have a whole catalog of things that could help like exercise, meditation, low carb diet and so forth but I have no idea if the effects of such things are worthwhile.

I've split the extra pill I had and it seems to help but I've been researching about tapering. Can I ride this out or are there any things I should worry about. My friend can get more so I can taper if its not safe to just stop CT.

should I worry about seizures? I can take the pain of withdrawals, I never want to take the pill again. The only reason I want to take it is because they recommend a taper even for small doses to prevent seizures.

Smoking/Vaping Cannabis helped me a little, even though it gave me anxiety, it was a different type. Eventually the feeling became more tolerable but this might not work for everyone.

I started taking .25 xanax about a month ago to help with sleep. I had a knee injury about 6 years ago that flares up every now and again. It started waking me up in the middle of the night, and since I didnt have any pain meds at the time I took some xanax to help me get back to sleep.

Lost track of how many nights in a row i was taking it, and after about a week my sleep started to suffer. I didnt put two and two together, so I kept taking it to help me sleep. 

It's been about a month now, and while there has been a few days in that time where I didnt take it, (sometimes 2 or 3 consecutive days) it's been pretty consistent. Now if I take the .25, I wake up 3-4 hours later and have to take another to fall asleep. 

Earlier in the week I took .5 before bed so I worry that my tolerance is going up. This insomnia is driving me insane and I'm anxious and on the brink of tears all day. I just pace around and worry about sleep. 

How long does everyone think this will last? I want to just stop taking it but every night I get anxious and I end up caving in and taking one which just kicks the can down the road.

I have a benzo dependancy, doctor prescribed.
I told him I want to quit and he says cut dose by half every 3 days till  no more and I'll be fine.

This sounds like a recipe for a long term disaster and possible suicide. I could not take a 2 or 3 year protracted withdrawal less any permanent damage. I'd rather just end it now. 

So I feel I have to taper slow on my own. Luckily my idiot doctor will give me any pills I ask for. Great doc right!

So after severe symptoms I Upped my dose of Valium to get stable. It worked mostly to get me 80% stabalized. 

Now I'm at 50 to 60mg Valium a day and will taper as slow as I need probably use Ashton method, to because I'm so scared of the nightmare stories of protracted 18 month plus withdrawal issues from a cold turkey.

Seems like benzo is the type of drug u gotta get out of your system real slow but I'm wrestling with the idea of being semi sick for 1 to 2 years.

The first 6 days were purely horror/crisis management. He is now on day 12th. He is finally more stable and this facility is managing his detox much slower. I saw him via Zoom for the first time and although he has lost a lot of weight he is stable, feels safe and ready to do the work. While detoxing they are also working on behavioral therapy to help him cope with his severe childhood trauma (what led to benzo use) It is going to be a long process and the drs tell me it comes in waves so even though i can’t stop them I am learning to ride them.

I was taking extremely high doses of the benzo analogue Clonazolam (15+mg per day) for months. I was also taking large doses of klonopin for about 10 months before this every single day. I had to go to a medical detox and the first three nights were awful. Then everything was okay.

Now I do still have a lot of rebound anxiety but other than that I feel normal. I’ve been diagnosed with panic and anxiety disorders so it’s not an unfamiliar feeling for me. 

I don’t feel like I’ve done any damage to my brain, I can still function normally and concentrate and think clearly. When I was taking those really high doses, I never once blacked out and just had a naturally high tolerance for benzos. I was a heavy binge drinker for about 7 years but have been sober from alcohol for a year now too. Maybe the years of alcohol abuse somehow programmed my brain to withstand high doses of benzos with little effect. I’m not sure but there may be some cross-tolerance there.

I was expecting to be struggling a lot more than I am based on all the posts here, but maybe I got off them just in time before they really grabbed a hold of me. In a way, it almost makes things more difficult because the fact that I had a pretty easy time getting off of them makes the demons in my brain tell me it’s okay to take more. But I do know that it would only be harder the next time if I ever got addicted again. 

Anyways, just wondering if anyone has shared a similar experience as me. I see all these horror stories but in all honesty, it was no more difficult than quitting caffeine or marijuana for me. I have cravings here and there but they are manageable. Other than the first three days of physical withdrawals, of course.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7440613508224487}"
2021-04-20 10:32:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/murnqx/grief/,Grief,"Hey guys,
I hope everyone reading this is doing ok or finding a way to be ok today. 
I’ve touched on a small bit on the subjects of Anger and Gratitude, but today I really want to talk about grief. 
I think it’s important to realize that regardless of which benzo you’ve been taking  or for how long- that these chemicals can have powerful effects in terms of dampening negative emotions and increasing feelings of wellbeing which is why we as people can become so drawn to them anyway. 

For me personally, while benzos were first prescribed to me for anxiety and physical pain. I noticed myself taking them more and more for the emotional pain that was going on in my life. When I was completely controlled by the pain and fear of my own emotions this med. allowed me to drown that out. When I had no one I could connect with in my life to safely talk about my feelings or to give me a hug, a warm touch on the shoulder, compassion, or love this medication was able to effectively give me the feeling as if I were being taken care of emotionally. 

It quickly became my replacement for love and also my escape from lacking it. I think it’s appropriate to keep in mind that losing that chemical crutch can cause a significant amount of grief. After all if you are no longer able to suppress your negative feelings at will as you are used to, well you can begin to grieve in a such a way that we would as if we were losing a close family member or friend. Relationships aren’t always with people. In fact, it’s strongly theorized that people will either form relationships with one another, or in the absence of the ability to do so will form a connection with an activity or substance instead. 

It is my belief that the very nature of addiction is formed on the lack of emotional connection. Human beings are social creatures and need human connection to survive, so it only makes sense to me that in the absence of that people will desperately search for what can give them those feelings of connection instead. I would like to take the time today to acknowledge that we are all indeed going through a grieving process at this time, I think it’s important to know the full scope of what we are up against.

I would love to hear you guy’s opinions in the comments below. Do you recognize some of your emotion and behavior patterns to be that of a person experiencing a loss in the more traditional sense?

When she was first out of the hospital it was a max of .5mg 4x daily, but fortunately she was on that dosage for a **very** short amount of time. Lately it's been .25mg either once before bedtime, or .25mg at about noon and then another .25mg sometime between 6 and 8 PM before bed. Her prescription is .25mg every 12 hours as needed. She is also currently on 10mg Oxycontin 2x daily, tapering down to 10mg 1x daily next week, and then cutting the Oxy out completely. We're also finishing up 300mg gabapentin before bed, last dose is probably Wednesday.

She has stage 4 lung cancer with mets to the bone, but it seems like the treatment she is on is massively reducing symptoms and improving her outlook - thus the taper of her narcotic painkillers - she had been on 20mg Oxy 3x daily when the cancer first took hold.

She didn't take any Ativan Saturday, even before bed, and Sunday was *rough* until she took .25mg at noon, and then again at 6:30 PM. Today she is back to more or less normal and doesn't seem to be having any withdrawals. We are hoping she only needs to take it before bed today.

I'm concerned about the Ativan usage long term, but I don't know if she is stable enough with her cancer, the fatigue (that we think is from the cancer/treatment), and her current narcotic taper down to taper down the Ativan at the same time, or even how we might go about tapering that small of a dose of Ativan.

Visual stimulation or bright lights would give me eye strain so bad that it felt like a pressure headache behind my eyes. I couldn't drive anymore because of this. Anyway...

The detachment and depression plus the visual sensitivity is now getting worse and I have a constant headache with dizziness. So my question is are all my issues related to the benzos?

Eight year long benzo user. First dose 2013* 1 mg. Ativan injected without knowledge or consent in ER. 
Was admitted to the psychiatric ward from there and diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Started on .5 milligrams xanax per inpatient psychiatrist. Was told several days later, upon discharge, that xanax is addictive. When I asked the nurse why that is she answered
 “because it is” 

Left ER with #120 .5 milligram xanax pills.
Eventually went off cold turkey for 1 year. 
Experienced auditory hallucinations of clicking sounds inside my brain when I opened my mouth, laid awake all night afraid if I moved my head I would have a seizure. Did not eat - could not.
Went back on benzos after I got down to 85 pounds. 

I made the decision to taper when my psychiatrist got investigated and their license pulled by the DEA. 
I knew at that point that it was only a matter of time before doctors would rip me off of it - 
Knew I wouldn’t survive withdrawal again. 
Got a primary care physician and switched to valium to taper. Did this for 1 year. 

Primary got ignorant with me and cut dose by half after stating I was in withdrawal on current dose - valium 10.5 milligrams. 
I was livid. 
Lost my job, and had to quit school because I could no longer function. 
I’m 4 months benzo free. 
I see withdrawal from these chemicals as an inhumane barbaric form of torture that millions are being subjected to. 

But part of beating this game that the health “care” system is playing is about strength of mind. 
We can and will beat big pharma through strength of mind and spirituality. 
Someone else said it best - I don’t know this person (they posted a comment on YouTube) - 
to paraphrase the comment:  “benzo withdrawal is a spiritual experience, you will never be who you were again, you will die and be reborn”. 

100 percent true. I’ll never go back to my chemical lobotomy. I’m writing a book about my experiences to raise awareness and to help others who are suffering. I would love to conduct interviews with patients in any stage of the benzo brain condition (people on benzos, people in active withdrawal, people suffering from PAWS -Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, practitioners that have prescribed, etc...)

My opinion - let’s blow the fucking lid off of what big pharma is doing to everyday people!! 
If you are interested in speaking with me for an interview - or resources for further support, just shoot me an email (or reddit message) at: Jahoney30@gmail.com

I’m very slowly tapering off Diazepam, how do i manage the withdrawal effects and make the tapering process easier?","I was first prescribed ativan as needed around august 2018 because i have severe anxiety and my psychiatrist was having a hard time finding an antidepressant or antipsychotic that worked. Of course i soon became dependent on it, i also have bpd but hadn’t gone through treatment at the time, and only got diagnosed with adhd 7 months ago. My psychiatrist at the time was incompetent and would increase my dose. Eventually i was prescribed to take it daily, and then he switched me to clonazepam. Summer 2020 I was taking 2.5-3mg clonazepam a day (i was prescribed that amount). I told my psychiatrist i thought it wasn’t healthy to be on this dose and i wanted to taper down, he switched me over to diazepam because apparently it’s easier to wean off of, but i was taking (and was prescribed) 30-35mg a day to start off (about equivalent to the clonazepam dose i was taking). Thankfully in September i started seeing a new amazing psychiatrist who seems to really know what he’s doing, he immediately diagnosed me with adhd and started to taper me off diazepam, the plan was to go down by 2.5mg every 4 weeks, i was also prescribed adderall which does make the tapering process easier. I’ve been sticking to this plan 100%, I am now down to 17.5mg a day. However, I have become unbearably anxious with heart palpitations and a very tense chest. I’m also much more paranoid and sensitive, and it’s making the symptoms of my BPD and body dysmorphia (a form of OCD) worse. Does anyone have any advice on how to make the tapering process easier and ease my anxiety a bit? After 2.5 years of being on benzos daily how long will the withdrawal effects last?

*Find something bigger than yourself to believe in whatever that looks like for you
*Practice self care, research what can help you feel better & put it into practice
*Be gentle to yourself and practice gratitude for people that do or have shown you kindness

Rapid-fire summary once again: I was on 0.5mg of Ativan 3 times a day for 6 weeks straight and then did a taper over the course of a couple of months. I had my last dose of Ativan (a quarter pill, 0.125mg) about 3 weeks ago. For the most part, I feel like I've been kicking serious ass; I've been walking pretty much every single day and it's been such a huge boost to my mood. My appetite was great and I was having full meals again. Aside from some (probably unrelated) weirdness with monthly cycle, my side effects were getting better.

And then for whatever reason, yesterday happened and I had a bout of intense anxiety that I hadn't felt in months. That anxious feeling where it genuinely feels like you need medical help because of how intense it is. I was able to ride it out somehow, but it lasted quite a long time. I was hoping maybe it was just an off day, but today I woke up similarly. Less anxiety, but horrendous nausea. I ended up taking a zofran as prescribed by my doctor but even with that and physically holding myself back from getting sick, I still vomited. Needless to say, this really sucks, as I hadn't had any issues with dry-heaving or vomiting ever since I was prescribed the zofran about a month ago. I wasn't even having to take it daily for the past couple of weeks. 

I just don't even know where to begin. I don't have anything specific that's causing me anxiety, and I really have nothing TO be anxious about. My therapist told me it could very well still be the pandemic subconsciously causing me stress, but even so, I thought things might improve as life has been improving. My psychiatrist recommended that I take a half or full Ativan (0.25mg and 0.5mg respectively) as-needed, but if these symptoms are still somehow withdrawal-related, I really don't want to mess anything up. 

I just want to be better again. It's so frustrating having all of this great progress only for these weird feelings to come up again with 0 explanation. It makes me doubt myself and start to worry that something is seriously wrong with my body or my brain. I'm not sure what to do or where to go next.

It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been on a benzo, you can taper off regardless. Don’t let anyone tell you other wise. 

Me personally and with my life of addiction and mental illness my future shows benzos in them. This is something definitely not to brag about or something that I am happy about. Everyone’s body is different and everyone will feel the affects of withdrawal differently and deal with the side effects in a different way. 

If I could go back to my first year of taking them I would pretend a train is coming at me and run! I had no idea ( which is my fault for not educating myself ) how addictive and dependent benzos can make someone. 

It is an amazing medication if you are in the middle of the worse panic attack of your life and you have to go to the E.R and they calm you down with .5 mgs of Ativan. 

I am so proud of anyone in here tapering down there dose and or getting off of benzos for good. 

I’m not trying to blame doctor’s, but I wonder how many of you were told by your doctor how dependent these meds can make you. I remember being prescribed Klonopin when I was 17 years old. I told my Doctor that I needed more and he referred me to a psychiatrist. I was on 3mgs. 

I just new that when I take one of these pills everything gets better.  I can be normal again after years of crippling anxiety. I wasn’t told that when I wanted to stop taking the medications my body had different plans. 

I am far from perfect because I self medicated. I personally believe benzos were my gateway drug. A magic pill with no side effects something that just makes you feel normal. 

As the time went on my dose just wasn’t enough. Again I didn’t educate myself on tolerance or how my body would start need more and more just to feel normal. 
Maybe I didn’t want to know because as soon as I walked into my Doctor I would tell him things are fine. I just wanted my prescriptions. 

Instead of going with the SSRI or something that takes a few weeks or you have to be a guinea pig for I just had my mind made up that I would just take the quick fix. 

Now I am 41 years old. Yes I can ( technically ) taper off of benzos and live with uncontrollable anxiety the rest of my life. I look at it like why should I waste a couple years getting off of 10mgs of diazepam 4 times a day when I’m already 41. 

The only thing I can do is give other people advice on how dependent you can become on a benzo.  Without even knowing that your body is dependent, 2 weeks of 1 mg of Xanax can do it. 

I see so many people in here asking for advice and taking the right steps. Keep fighting!!! You can live happily off the benzos! Just taper off safe. 

Anyone can get off of them. I might sound like a hypocrite considering I’m choosing to stay on but there’s a lot of my life that isn’t written with the variables and factors. I wish more then anything I could taper off. 

I do know how hard it is. I am sorry, I have to write this stuff. 

Remember that you become dependent on medication. Your body does. It doesn’t mean you are an addict. 

I wish that they had special treatment centers for just benzo recovery. Remember if you ever end up going inpatient tell the Doctor everything. Speaking from experience I personally think that tapering off from home is a lot better then a facility. 

After being off benzos your body will thank you! You will feel so much better. You won’t have to worry about long term problems and you will be able to help other people. 

There’s so many charts out there as far as a taper scale and if some is too much for you, just do it a little bit slower. If it’s easy for you maybe you can do it a little bit faster. 

Please make sure to check your blood pressure at least once a day. It is so important. I was 19 when I realized I had hypertension and I know that it wasn’t my first reading that was high. 

I’m far from being proud of this but when it comes to benzos and information about them I co-wrote the book.

Just wanted to provide an anecdotal experience in this sub. Finished my 16-month taper about 9 months ago, and been healing incredibly well. Have been dabbling with Nootropics, Vitamins and Exercise to increase my overall health, and two weeks ago I have had a very negative experience with Magnesium L-Threonate. 

I had been taking L-Threonate for about 2 months already, but only at a 30% (144mg) of the recommended dose. Upped the dose to 100%, and had one of the worst weeks since I stopped tapering. Tremors came back, couldn't sleep, anxiety through the roof and a constant buzzing in my head. Stopped taking L-Threonate all together, and after a few days, I was mostly fine with some residual effects lingering. Then a few days ago, I took another 144mg pill, and well... withdrawals returned. It also made me incredibly sensitive to caffeine again; very much like when I was tapering.

I'm pretty convinced at this point that L-Threonate, through some GABA function must trigger my withdrawals, because I am used to experiencing benzo withdrawals in the past 5 years, and this feels way too familiar. Other than L-Threanate I only took L-Theanine and Fish-oil during this experience, so perhaps some cross-reaction was at play; although I have never experienced any issues with L-Theanine.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9904324412345886}"

And the long half of the Valium for me was harder and longer to get off of. So I went to .5mg 3x a day. 2 days ago I completely stopped my day dose. The withdrawal is ehh, tolerable I guess however I was given 25mg of hydroxyzine and it does slightly take the edge off. I’m waiting for my doctor to call back but would it be a problem to double up and take 50mg each time?

In the past I took xanax for about 5 years at 0.5 mg - 1 mg daily and went cold turkey at some point,  well with a small dose of klonopin and clozapine to help me with insomnia,  but even that withdrawals was hell,  took me 4 weeks to recover,  so I'm kinda aware of benzo stuff. 

What I did now its that I started to have high anxiety and kinda needed to do some errands so I started taking xanax more often,  dosages was 0.5 mg to 1.5 mg at maximum,  there was some days where I just pooped 1mg of xanax and going outside to have some beer with friends... I know it's kinda stupid. 

Anyway I just did have some days where I didn't take it at all , mostly I took it every other day,  or you know,  last three days I took 1mg with some lyrica, and my last dosage was today because I had a really stressful event,  1mg of xanax and 10 mg of diazepam,  I was so chill and sleepy. 

From my perspective it was a mildy binge with small breaks,  however I'm worried about withdrawals now, since from tomorrow I will stop using any benzodiazepines for a good two three weeks, and there won't be any more binges like this. 

I'm prepared for some rebounds,  but dunno how long will last   , what you guys think  ? 

All I hope its to not have those nasty withdrawals like 6 years ago when I cold turkey xanax after 5 years of daily usage.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987416863441467}"

I have taken clonazepam Heavy the last 30 or more days I don't know my memory has been shit cause the pills. I have taken around 150 2 mg pills these 30 or so days, i take between 4-10 mg a day usually and have always had a high tolernace and have had benzo addiction before.

I'm planning to taper i have 24 2 mg pills left I'm taking 1 tonight so i have 23 left tomorrow.

My taper plan is to tomorrow take 3 pills, 1 in the morning, 1 in at afternoon then 1 at night.

Then from April 17 to April 21 taking 2 a day 1 in the morning then 1 at night.

Then from April 22 to May 2 taking 1 a day a half in the morning and a half at night.

Is the taper necessary or can i just quit without withdrawal and if i can't is this a good taper plan, i have been drinking some GHB and Alcohol and also been taking some ambien during this time which i know can effect the withdrawals as they all affect GABA receptors.

forgot to mention 2 months before i started taking clonazepam i was taking 3 to 6 grams Gabapentin in those two month and felt som withdrawal from that so started taking clonazepam to temporary get rid of those withdrawals from the Gabapentin. So It's a about a 3 month addiction daily with the Gabapentin and Clonazepam

First time I’ve ever blacked out off a bar.
I was doing them just on weekends sometimes Friday and Saturday. Took 2 weeks off and felt fine. Then took 4 bars over a weekend. I suppose this is where I fucked up. I didn’t use for 10 days and had a panic attack like I never have had in my life. I took an Ativan and managed to sleep. Now the next night same thing and I took another. I guess I’m having withdrawals (I’m a huge fucking idiot I already know thanks). Anyway I had got rid of the remaining presses but have some Ativan still. I know switching to Ativan probably was not the smartest but I was losing my mind. If anyone has any insight on what I should do now it would be greatly appreciate it. I feel like such an idiot.

2021-04-14 04:18:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/mqm65z/my_success_story/,My success story,"Hi everyone. It's been a long time since I've visited here.

I was on 2 mg of klonopin for about five years, and then switched to 10 mg of diazepam for another five years. (I know that in itself is a pretty dramatic cut but I wasn't paying attention to the equivalency and just switched without many problems). I was on benzos for almost ten years total. During that time I also abused alcohol.

I decided to withdraw during lockdown. I quit alcohol and cigarettes first. Then I tapered down off the 10 mg of diazepam, and ""jumped off"" in November. Here I am in mid April. I have to say: I feel basically normal and have pretty much felt normal for a few months now. In the beginning I had migraines and was twitching all over with involuntary muscle spasms. They weren't painful but they were annoying. I had really bad anxiety.

That's mostly all gone now. I go to small social gatherings (I'm vaccinated) without alcohol or benzos. I've made new friends. I make better social decisions. When someone is treating me badly, instead of popping a valium and just pressing through, I set a boundary. I still have some cognitive issues and haven't been able to return to full time work, but I suspect that's only partly due to benzo withdrawal. I also didn't work during the last years I was on substances, and rather just lived off savings and the occasional project. Right now I'm supposed to be jumping into something completely different so I think I'm more than anything worried about a new endeavor than I am being impeded by benzo withdrawal.

I don't have any insomnia. Different ways of thinking that I'd lost while on benzos are coming back. I'm able to remember the way I used to study at university and approach learning in a similar way. I'm able to see every situation much more clearly. It really does feel like having an entirely new life and being a completely different person. One thing that I did not realize while I was on benzos is that the benzos were making me depressed. They were making me anxious. I used them not to think, not to feel; I used them to override my natural hesitation about things I should have been hesitant about. Certain things are supposed to make you feel uncomfortable because they aren't good for you. Benzos flattened everything out: things, people, situations that should have made me pause didn't make me think twice. That led to so many problems I can't even count.

While on benzos I neglected everything: I let long lingering minor health problems go on unaddressed. I allowed abusive people to stay close to me. I did not learn new things or try to learn new things. Worse, I stopped imagining that I could do new things, or could fix health problems, or could meet healthier, better people. The horizon was too murky.

I have a completely new life. I'm humbled by it. I feel hopeful about it. If I can get my ability to focus back, and become independent doing that work, I will have gotten everything from before benzos back and more. Have faith.

Literally everything has turned negative. I used to be that go-lucky guy in my early 20s (28 now). Every little thing affects me to the point of tears. Someone said I was a lazy POS (they don’t know that I’m tapering a benzo) and I was hurt by it when normally I’d say fuck that dude and move on. Literally to the point of tears. That’s not who I am. 

I can usually deal with some of the symptoms- the tinnitus, the sound/visual sensitivity, the stomach problems, the brain fog +many other strange symptoms but what brings the worst out of me is the tremors or shaking. It doesn’t happen often, but when it starts up I just lay there & cry. For some reason it makes me feel like I’m going to be disabled forever because it’s been a constant symptom. The look on my wife’s face, or the look others give me when I’m involuntarily shaking or moving just makes me feel worse. 

I’ve slowly but surely been losing confidence in this process but I keep going because 1) I don’t want to be on Klonopin anymore, 2) I’m going to run out eventually. 

But this has fucked me up. I have no positivity left. 

Im just having one of those days. 

 Someone just fucking tell me I’m not going insane. I just need some motivation. I’m broken. But I need to keep going. I feel like I’m losing grip on reality. If you kicked this shit already, you deserve a Medal of Valor.

Edit: Thank you guys for encouraging me. You don’t understand how much you’ve helped me today. I’m not suddenly “cured” but you guys helped me feel like someone is there to listen. That goes such a long way. Thank you.",56,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994487166404724}"

This is the longest I have been off of klonopin since 2012. I went to ASU for school and spent my entire time there taking klonopin prescribed by the dr. He had overprescribed me 5x2mg DAILY and I abused the shit out of that. I worked in a nightclub and would go out at night with a pocketful of klonopin and wake up wherever, next to whoever, broken ankles, fell in a cactus, whatever the story may be. I blacked out every single time I drank and thought I was having the time of my life. My friends would physically remove me from nightclubs, and I would make my way back. There was a pool party one afternoon and I was destroyed by 11am. My friends took me home and put me in bed. I woke from my short nap and drove across campus, and didn't come out of my blackout until I walked in the hallway and saw my friends faces. I didn't remember driving my car, I could have killed people. I did this for about 4 years straight, every single night. I am positive there is some permanent damage there, but I cant describe how much better I feel within the short time I have been off of klonopin.  I have tried countless times to get off of klonopin, but this time it finally stuck. I tried very hard right at the beginning of covid but one week in, couldn't handle it.  I would try for a few days here and there but would always run back to the bottle. This time when I ran out, I didn't refill the script- cant take it if I don't have it. The biggest difference this time was I didn't feel like I was forcing myself to get off of the drug, I felt like it was just over with, I had my run and that was it. I really think this was the determining factor. The first week sucked, super irritable and just being a dick. the second week was around the same temperament, as was the third. During the third week I kept getting anxiety attack's which I never really had before ( I was prescribed for social anxiety) and would constantly think about how we don't life forever and I would get really sad. I was trying to use weed as much as possible, but realized that was probably a big root cause of my anxiety, and have since used cbd. By the forth week things started to turn in the right direction. This isn't to say I'm not still withdrawling, but now its controllable and it doesn't bother me because I know it will be better.

I really want to push this home as much as possible, there is not only light at the end of the tunnel, the tunnel is fucking awesome! I don't feel stupid anymore, I can form sentences quicker, I don't pause and forget, my math is on point. I was so scared at first because I know I have done damage to my brain, but that fog has subsided now. The biggest accomplishment for me is having dinners. I always hated this because I tend to talk a lot and when no one is talking I didn't know where to look, what to do, I would stare off, be extremely uncomfortable, but that is not the case anymore! I have had a few dinners since then and had a great dinner last night at a restaurant.

You can do this. Nothing is stopping you from quitting except yourself. When your having a rough day, do what makes you truly happy. Don't wallow in self pity. Get exercise, the world is opening back up get some sun. Do what makes you uncomfortable, once you realize it wont kill you, it will be a walk in the park- I never thought those words would come out of my mouth.....",22,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988883137702942}"

After a slow ashton manual taper I jumped just over 3 weeks ago. Withdrawls were brutal for 2 weeks then began to fade I thought I was doing so well and actually felt better than I have ever felt in YEARS. I felt happiness again and it was short lived. Someone on here suggested CBD and its been the biggest regret of my life. I took pure cbd in VERY high doses. Double whats considered high because I read that cbd is safe even at way higher doses than I took. Iv been smoking weed for 15 years so I didnt think much of the CBD. Then the nightmare began... I woke up about 3 weeks after jumping with the loudest ringing ever in my head 24/7 non stop ringing which drove me insane. I went to the ER and other doctors and basically they all said its tinnitus and most likely permanent. I never had tinnitus and im almost certain that the high doses of cbd triggered it. The noise is unbearable and last night I took 0.25mg of clonaz and today I also took 0.25mg mainly because the tinnitus was making me suicidal. I have never had a suicidal thought in my life until now. Anyways now my dilemma is will I get kindling? Should I even continue the jump. I had the best week of my life up until the ringing in my ears started. The ring is louder than my fan and my tv both its maddening and giving me more anxiety than I have ever had. I dont know what to do. If this ringing doesnt stop than I dont want to live anymore I just cant its pure torture. Im thinking of taking 0.25mg for a bit just to see if the ringing will stop and then re taper. The taper is peanuts for me in comparison to the tinnitus. What do you all think about this?
 
Btw anyone thinking of taking cbd after jumping DONT it doesnt help withdrawl symptoms hardly enough where its worth risking getting tinnitus. My biggest regret now is someone here recommending it. After doing some research it can definitely itself trigger tinnitus",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976670742034912}"

I was on .5 Lorazapam once a day for almost 6 months for GAD. Way longer then I wanted to be. I tried many different antidepressants through that time to assist with the anxiety. Nothing worked. I grew a tolerance to the benzo , but never increased. I developed depression with it as well. I decided to go all natural with my treatment and hired a hollistic doctor and schedule hypnosis for trauma counseling.
My medical doctor told me I could do a quick taper because of my low dose. Well I cut to .25 daily and have had issues. More depression. Tremors. Increased panic. Insomnia. Body aches. Blurry vision. Dizziness. You name it. I ordered CBD oil and some supplements to assist and am awaiting their arrival. My doctor prescribed Gabapentin, but I do not want to take it with risk of another dependency.
I did not take my .25 yesterday. I was ok. Today I woke up not and just took it. My doc wants me to try every other day now then in a week do 12.5 every other day. Is this good advice? Will it make this process worse or give me interdose withdrawal? She also told me once im off, I could keep rescue doses. Is this safe to do or will I hurt my process?

This is my first time posting something here and I'm not even sure if this is the right thread, so bear with me (it's mostly just me venting). Also sorry if I make any mistakes, english is not my first language.

A few days ago I was by myself at home (I live with my sister outside my home country) and I decided to take a few Ativan pills (I had them prescribed and been taking them for a few months now, along with antidepressants) because I was feeling a little down (I'm always feeling kind of down out of nowhere, I'm diagnosed with BPD among other things. Anyway, just the usual sad, it wasn't like I wanted to end my life or something). So I decided to ignore my phone because I didn't feel like talking to anyone and then took around 15 mg (which I have never done before) and actually got a little better, but after some time I decided to take more. Now, this is where everything gets blurry. I have never in my life had a blackout from pills nor alcohol. I remember I started taking all the pills I could find, and ended up taking around 100 Ativan pills, some Valium, some Dexketoprofen and some Ultran, mixed with a little wine and beer. After that, I can't really remember what happened. I guess some time passed and suddenly I noticed that I had blood all over my hands and legs and realised I was cutting myself with a blade, the only thing I can recall is having the feeling that everything was now out of my control. I somehow managed to text some friends, and luckily they were able to contact my sister and I got hospitalized after two stomach pumpings. I have never cut myself before, nor I had any desire to do it. I'm not an impulsive person and I tend to be really responsible, even with recreational drug usage. I certainly didn't want to kill myself so I'm extremely confused. The worst thing is that I don't feel bad for myself and I don't regret it, but I do feel really guilty for worrying all of my friends and family and losing their trust in me. Also, not happy with all of the wounds I have all over my legs. Anyway, we went to my psychiatrist after being released from the hospital and she told us it was a dissociative episode, which also has never happened to me before.

I have read about blackouts with benzos and stuff, but what I don't get is the self harm thing I did. I don't remember ANYTHING at all which really frustates me, and I just don't know what to do to feel better/less guilty. I know it's gonna take a while, it's just really weird and I still cannot quite believe it happened.

Well I startet using Lorazepam (Ativan) August 2019 due to a depressive phase, which is over since then.

My usual dose is 0.5mg to 0.75mg lorazepam. I would say i took it 3 times per week on average, always in the evening and never more than 0.75 mg.

Sometimes it was 3 nights in a row (which was very rare), sometimes just one night and then with a gap of 3 days between using. Sometimes i stopped for 5 days and took it only on weekends. I cant say I ever took it more than 3 days in a row. But Im doing this for more than 1.5 years now, occasionally.

In January I quit for 10 days without experiencing any withdrawal symptoms. I wanted to quit there totally but I enjoyed it taking too much to stop it completely. Since then I take it regularly 2-3 times a week again, 0.5mg max.

So my last dose of lorazepam was saturday evening. I dont feel any wd symptoms, but Im scared they could show up or I could experience a seizure out of nowhere.

So far, my withdrawal from clonazepam has been the most painful.  So far I've been getting splitting headaches, bulging veins on my temples, tremors, body-wide aching that I can notice through my other chronic pains, and after reading some stories about other's withdrawal experiences, I'm aware this won't go away for a while.    


I was on it for a bit in high school, was prescribed it again when I was 20, and was taking .5mg from then until last Tuesday.  First day just felt strange, second was incapacitating in its agony, and the last few days have been a mixed bag.  Laying down gives me a headache, and I feel like I just got sucker punched, but still feel like someone just took a bag off my head that's been there for as long as I can remember.  I can \*feel\* the people around me in social situations.  I'm autistic, so social situations have always been somewhat of an alien thing for me even though I enjoy them, but as trite as it sounds I ""feel human"" now.

Benzos I abused for 8 months: Clonozolam , Etizolam , Diclazepam , Diazepam , Lorazepam , Clonazepam , Alprazolam , Nitrazepam - All in high dosages especially clonozlam

I then switched to Valium as I really enjoyed the long lasting affects without knowing I tapered down since the benzos I used we’re extremely high potency , I genuinely thought this is the wd that’s gonna break me my last withdrawal was last year and that lasted 2 months of pure fucking hell every symptom I copped.

This was my first wd that didn’t shatter my fucking life I was training hard as fuck during the first few symptoms I ate extremely healthy I took vitamin d vitamin b 12 magnesium & fish oil daily I was getting sunlight daily I was doing shit when I felt like shit and some how all these things in combination fucked off all symptoms!!! , I Ct’D off diazepam around a week ago with no symptoms and the dosage was 5mg split into 2.5 for a week so 1 tablet every 3 days & I stopped I shit my self thinking this is the end but no was I wrong instead of extreme wd came extreme happiness extreme dedication extreme motivation

Summary - I stopped using randomly because I just don’t like taking pills. I was taking them because I felt like it was helping my intercostal muscles relax, I had injured the intercostal muscle after having the flu. I had anxiety from it because I wasn’t able to breath to the ER prescribed me Ativan. I had no idea what that was I thought it was like Advil or something. 

Made me feel good but I was interdosing, which made me feel anxious the days I didn’t take it. I got to the point where I was hyperventilating, and I couldn’t handle hot temperatures outside, it was wild what this shit did to me. I couldn’t believe I was having dependency on this from that little amount use. I still didn’t believe it until I went in Reddit. I stopped cold turkey in July, and I went through hell for the first two weeks. I literally thought I had MS from all the symptoms. I even joined an MS group on Reddit. 

Long story short, I started improving little by little. Every month I had a slight improvement, but it kept my self busy with long walks in malls, parks. My nervous system wasn’t used to walking, I couldn’t even walk with out being out of breath. It was the scariest thing for me because I was very fit before that, trained 7 days week, did Brazilian jiu jitsu. I was 195lbs at 14 percent body fat. I had dropped down to 160lbs. I really looked like shit.  

Fast forward - it’s April, and I’m feeling much more normal. I feel like I’m 90 percent healed. Maybe because I’m not in shape the way I used to be or think I should be.  But the twitching of the muscles has decreased, I’ve been getting it recently whenever I have a rigorous weight lifting session. Especially when I do Olympic lifts, my shoulder starts twitching. I don’t know if this is normal but I hope it gets better. 

I’ve been able to do the skiierg, I did 1000m at 4:30m which is ok I guess. There was no way I would’ve been able to do this in July. I’ve gained 16lbs, I’m at 176lbs now, I feel bad look much healthier and normal I think. All my friends don’t know what I’ve been through. They were just saying to me “man you’ve lost so much weight”. 

I’m feeling better guys, and I think everyone else can. I think the key is to have a good sleep schedule, eat good foods, and exercise is key to strengthen you nervous system. I would said work out atleast three times a week, and build your body’s nervous system. I have even started drinking caffeinated drinks, which there was no way in hell I was able to do before. I started by drinking kombucha, and my brain finally was able to handle it after a few months. I keep the caffeine at 45mg for now. 

I’m just worried about the twitching I get after training. But I hope that’s not going to be permanent, and I hope I’m still going to improve. Just wanted to let you guys know what’s up and if anyone has any idea about the twitching let me know I’d like to hear if anyone has completely recovered from random twitching.

My sister is 23 years old and just last year was diagnosed with bipolarity and OCD. My sister has been to the ER 4 times for abuse of clonazepam or melex. She always says the same thing ""I didn't want to kill myself, I was feeling very anxious and that's why I took too much."" Right now we had to admit her because the 2 mg of clonazepam did not work for her and she became super angry because she could not control the medicines.

She will be under surveillance for a month in the hospital, due to the covid we cannot see or contact her. I have ADHD, my father also and I am coming to think that perhaps her diagnosis is not 100% correct. These ""crises"" that she gets were mainly because she started looking for medicines when she felt bad.

I'm posting this because a female friend of mine I recently met, has an addiction of clonazepam.

She came to visit me one day to watch a movie, and when she came in she told me she was extremely high because she had a panic attack a couple hours before and took way too much clonazepam. We tried watching the movie but she didn't understand anything that was going on, tried talking to her but she was just gone for several seconds while looking at me, then she ask me to repeat myself and then not understanding anything I was talking about.
She got progressively better tho, had a good time, she was able to speak and have decent conversations afterwards.

After she left, I started questioning her on whatsapp, why would she take such dangerous doses of an addictive substance. She just said she does what the doctor told her. I kept asking, and found out the doctor gave her a prescription for a dropper, of a very high dose of clonazepam. And told her that everytime she feels bad, *to use as much as she felt she needed.*

I might be talking out of my ass because of ignorance,  but that last part is what seems completely unreasonable to me. Why would a doctor prescribe that? That will 100% lead to serious addiction. The dropper already was of a high dosage, about 0.6 mg per drop. And she tells me that she constantly uses +15 drops to calm herself down. This is completely insane for me.

She said she started low, a drop was enough to calm herself down for a whole two days. But then she started to develop a resistance of the substance, and fear of having another panic attack, so she slowly started upping up the dose. Following her doctor's advice ""taking as much as she feels she needs"" lead to the abuse of the drug

Again, I might be talking out of my ass due to ignorance, and the prescription was actually ok. But I just know how bad the side effects are for this substance, and how hard and dangerous it is to stop consuming it. I've heard how dr Jordan Peterson described his detox of clona, and it sounds so terrible and painful.

I just wanna know if I'm in the right, and this prescription is insane. Hopefully it isn't.

I hope this is the correct sub to post in. If not, I apologize.

My situation:

For about 14 months I have taken about 1 mg of Xanax (illegal, not prescribed) daily. During weekends  - meaning friday and saturday - I have been up to 6-8 mg those days. I've managed to go down to 1mg on weekdays without much withdrawal symptoms though. In addition, I know I drink too much but had a ""sober October"" last year without too many difficulties. The Xanax use continued though.

So the situation today:

About 1, sometimes 2, MG Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday 6 - 8 MG. Sunday 1 -2 MG.

Obviously, I am a recreational user, I am buying illegally, but this has gone too far. I notice that my tolerance is way too high.

I just went 24 hours without any pills and (this MIGHT be psychological), and I started getting paranoid for getting tremors (is this the right word? English is not my main language). So I ended up eating 1 MG after about 36 hours.

So - all in all: I am looking for advice to be able to taper down my Xanax use. I notice my tolerance is a lot higher now, however, I manage on 1 MG/day. Also, I want to mention, for various reasons, doctors are out of the question for now.

I have been thinking a bit. Might something like this work:

Week 1:

1 MG every other day.

0.5 MG every other day.

Keep it like this for say 2 - 4 weeks?

Then strictly 0.5 MG / Day for 2 - 4 weeks.

Then either:

1. 0.5 MG every other days'
2. Cold Turkey

Also, since I am buying this illegally I have to keep my stash stacked up somewhat. If I should reach a point where I am om 0.5 MG every other day, then due to stupidity go on a binge on a Saturday, will everything be all fracked up again - having to start tapering all over?

Other info: I am in a stable job as software developer, so I have to somewhat function on a daily to daily basis without too much discomfort. I have cold turkey'ed opiates earlier in my life and that made me unable to work. From what I read, Xanax is even worse.

I appreciate all answers, please don't judge me. I know I have brought this upon myself, but I am seeking some advice from kind souls to get out of this.

Thank you.

We got a patient in, 70 year old lady who had fallen while on blood thinners. She had a massive bleed into her abdomen under her skin.

She had a psychiatric history and was prescribed 1mg of alprazolam three times a day with 500mcg triazolam at night. The team decided to stop these medications as they thought they could make her drowsy. No thought was given as to how long she was on them or to the dangers of withdrawal, they were just stopped outright.

Of course 24 hours later the patient becomes really agitated, confused and aggressive with visible tremors. She was refusing treatment and was incredibly difficult to manage. She ended up getting sedated with an antipsychotic agent (haloperidol). I suggested benzodiazepine withdrawal as a potential cause of her symptoms but nobody listened, I was just the intern after all.

Several days later she got a psychiatric review and her medications were restarted. She easily could have seized and died, and this was all in a hospital setting with 24 hour care by a team of doctors.

It's crazy how little your average doctor knows about the dangers of longterm benzo use. They assume because these are prescription drugs that they can be stopped and started on a whim.

So I’m almost 7 months out- post taper. Iv been back in a bad wave for about 9 days now but before this wave I was doing so well- for about 8 weeks I was in a window(shaky moments but mostly completely fine) I went back to work last month im a nurse etc etc been doing great. THEN the Friday before last I had some Botox.. I haven’t had any for around 2 years so I really felt like I needed it and wanted to feel good again etc! Well that was 9 days ago and since then Iv had acute style symptoms- like the adrenaline dump feeling in my chest, headaches and head pressure, palpitations, loud tinnitus which is constant, just generally feeling “off”, uncomfortable and on edge, feeling of being on a boat and dizzy at times. It’s hard to explain how I feel. If I had to try to explain, it feels like my body is plugged into a socket and I have an electrical current going through constantly, making me feel like even my eyes are shaking and I’m vibrating!! 

Anyway my question is, has anyone else experienced this with Botox? If so how long did it last? 

My sister is a doctor and she insists that there’s no way a tiny amount of Botox could do this as it is placed in a localised area, she thinks that this is a coincidence. I have heard of people reacting to different foods etc but I dont react to food. I did at one stage while tapering but not since I jumped. Also i must add that I only got the smallest amount of Botox, a lot less than normal in case of a reaction as I understand my CNS is still very sensitive.

I am just really worried incase I am stuck like this!!(i know everyone thinks like this and I’m trying not to be too irrational) It’s so difficult not truly knowing what causes our waves and not knowing how long it’s gonna last and how long it’s gonna take us to feel better 😩

What’s crazy to me is that I went on Kaiser’s Permenate website and looked up benzodiazepines, there is a section specifically on how to taper a patient down from benzos.

Quick rapid-fire info, I was on 0.5mg of Ativan 3 times a day for 6 weeks straight and then did a taper over the course of a couple of months. I had my last dose of Ativan (a quarter pill, 0.125mg) last Saturday and overall I've had some really conflicting symptoms. Going down to 1mg is what really kicked by ass, and though I'm having some nausea, headaches, anxiety and the like, it doesn't feel as bad as it was during that part of the taper. 

However I've now been having some fun new symptoms that I can't even tell are related to the benzos or not. Last Saturday night, I began to notice a dull aching pain in my lower back/right buttock and right thigh, and over the course of this week it's spread to also affect my left buttock and left thigh. It goes away pretty easily with ibuprofen. On top of that, (sorry for potential gross TMI) I've had this weird brown discharge in between my periods for the past couple of weeks. My GYN thinks it's just breakthrough bleeding being caused by my birth control, but in the 8 or so years I've been taking it, I've never had this issue before. I genuinely don't know if this is just hormonal changes caused by getting older, or if benzo withdrawal can affect this sort of thing. I did notice my last period when tapering was a lot harder to get through so it could be that.

Lastly, I've had some increases in anxiety lately that have just thrown me for a loop. I know rebound anxiety is a thing but the intensity of it the past few days has been really scaring me. One of my worst fears has been the thought of potentially backsliding into how bad my anxiety was back in the winter (the whole reason I was put on Ativan in the first place) where it was so bad I genuinely thought I was going to die. I really don't want to go backwards in progress, I just want to be done with all of this. 

Any advice or any experiences you guys have had are greatly appreciated. I've never gone through something like this before and I'm very sensitive to medication in the first place, so I don't even know what's considered ""normal"" or not. I jumped off at such a low dose but I know that Ativan is pretty strong. I was making such good progress before I jumped, so it's just really disheartening to start seeing some of this weirdness crop up again.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973457455635071}"

If it’s quitting smoking, i wont even breathe. 
It it’s eating healthy, i will rail lines of diet whey.
And If its studying, i will use amphetamines during the day and then use benzos as the eject button when I think i’ve done enough. This last example is the situation that I find myself in now. 

I’m currently in my last year at one of the top 3 universities in the UK studying law, i won’t say which because I don’t think they like their alumni to be openly doping.

But since November i have been using Xanax intermittently for high stress events, like giving speeches to my fellow students about shit I don’t even understand and participating in moot court cases, or dosing prior to the first dinner with my girlfriend’s parents - i had to very cautiously walk the line between drinking enough wine to seem polite and not enough to enjoy that forbidden fruit of benzo/booze mix, dying on the dinner plate; much to the, almost certain, dismay of my girlfriend’s parents.

My exams are less than 3 weeks away, i am using speed 3/4 times a week but benzos everynight. Although when not amped up; I only feel that i should have 3 valiums (bought in preparation for a taper) to make sure i don’t convulse and die before the exams come around. This seems sufficient. On nights of higher energy, perhaps 9mg of Xanax is required for a good rest. 

I can’t say the whole studying supplement line up isn’t pleasurable, it is. But i fear that when it comes time to stop, things may be darker than I am imagining, by all accounts given on this subreddit.

I’ve read the ashton manual, and you will all collectively detest me for saying this: I do not want to be tapering off for a third of a year. I want to taper fast, suffer and learn. 

I have a creeping suspicion that - yes, while my GABA and dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin receptions are all outta whack - I don’t anticipate to go full Ian Curtis in my epilepsy and subsequent suicide (watch this space) but I do anticipate great discomfort. 

How likely is it and if possible, how long will i have to wait until I can return to using benzodiazepines as they are intended, not the classic 2-4 week period, but intermittently, to achieve the best performance I can?

I’ve slid down the slippery slope before. A benzo for this talk, a benzo for that dinner, a benzo for my trip to the barber, a benzo for a trip to the shops and worst of all, a benzo to mong out to some shit TV with loads of food that i’ll not remember and have to rewatch tomorrow. 

I have been dependent and addicted, to a much greater extent before and I quit with very little discomfort then, tapering 10mg of valium a night from 70mg and being off in one week. I’m aware of the kindling effect and what this might mean for the next few weeks and I hear you already saying, you can’t control yourself, they hijack your mind - but I believe this will not be the case again. 

When used appropriately, they are fantastic medicine - almost cheat codes. I want to get back to cheating my own nature and my misfiring anxiety survival response. 

Please do not make psychoanalytical assumptions about me from this text - but, objectively, can one quit and return to therapeutic use?

(All prescribed, when trying to get off of it) but I never really had the strength to stop. 

I took 2mg every day & 4 months ago I stopped after a month long taper. (The details of that are in another post) but I just wanted to say that it gets easier and it gets better 😊

When I initially stopped, my anxiety was THROUGH THE ROOF. I always get awful side effects. Even now, I’ve been off my SSRI for a week and it’s honestly so terrible. Nothing was worse than the benzo though. And I’ll never forget it but the point is, it’s possible!

In the moment, it sucks, it’s awful, it can be life threatening which makes it scary and makes you more cautious to do it. Tapering is important but taper in a way that you’re not just prolonging the process.. you don’t need to shave down the pills, it’s just going to delay you finally getting better! Talk to your doctor & do whatever they recommend but usually lowering by .25-.5 is standard. 

I could say so many things about my experiences on the medication & how it was getting off of it but if you have questions or anything please message me 🙃 I want you all to succeed and want you to get healthy because I’m happier than I’ve ever been (despite that SSRI withdrawal now 😂) but hey, it’s a process.

I know they act differently. But I don't want a refill, I got 5 left, gonna cut them in half, quarter even and still take my Ativan for now.

My 9 months is coming up soon. Then a year before I know it. Recovery has not been easy.  I've been trying to get my ex-gf back this whole time. That made this whole ordeal extremely difficult.  It was liberating in a sense as I felt vindicated when she finally met me sober, but still upset I failed. But then again, I didn't fail. I recovered. Or am Recovering...

I feel good but I do feel slightly crazy. I don't know if it's from this sick game I've been playing with her or if benzos really mess up your mind for this long. I guess when you were only using 5-10% of your brain when you hit 60-90% it feels like 100%! It's a great feeling though. Don't give up people. If I am able to recover from my usage than I like your chances!

 Hi all! I am almost 15 years in recovery from Benzos, Alcohol and cocaine. I now work as a certified recovery coach and also run small, private detoxes in AZ and CO (and soon to be TX and NV). We do benzo detox (and all other substances, including VERY high levels of methadone, like 300mg!) where you come to us for about a week and then we oversee your final 6 week taper via online telemedicine to make sure you are successful. We created an atmosphere with only 6 private bedrooms where you have your own room with a TV and a queen sized bed, allow electronics and smoking and have an IV method of detox that keeps you really comfortable during the detox. More importantly, I know a TON of places and people that can help across the country - so please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you need help! This is not for money, it's to give back!

The question is: can you guys tell me your experiences with gabapentine and possibly clonodine? 

I'm still on my taper and I'm doing it pretty fast and the discomfort is starting to really set in. My doctor said we can slow down at any point but even my psych has commended me for sticking it through so quick but also gave me caution to not overdo it, especially since I've always been on the ""I wanna get off this ASAP"" mindset. In the last month or so I've dropped from 20 mg to current 8 mg of Valium. I've been on Valium for a few months if you guys check my history here of stabilization. First week we went down to 15 then the next was to 10 and that was a killer for a bit. Now I'm at 8 and holding for now because it seems like discomfots starting to catch up.

To digress, my doc prescribed both just in case one works better than the other. I'm a bit more interested on the gabapentine side. I was prescribed 100mg and can take as needed. I haven't tried it yet just because I like to avoid introducing more drugs into my system.

I got off numerous medications including opioids in the last 8 months and am experiencing PAWS, dealing with an untreated thyroid issue and major depressive disorder. My symptoms include anhedonia, depression, insomnia, anxiety, psychogenic itch, fatigue, poor attention span and memory, random aches, pains and spasms, tmj, weight loss and more. I have gotten off everything except for 1 mg of klonopin. I’ve been prescribed benzos for the last 9 years. This is the primary predicament. The klonopin is clearly adding to my depression and anhedonia. The anhedonia is unbearable and makes my life torture. I have been in a cycle of anhedonia and depression for 6 months now. I don’t feel that I am stable enough to resume tapering my klonopin and the more I mess with my dose the worse my symptoms will get. I am looking at a long road to recovery. Another 3-12 months before my anhedonia get better. Then 6-12 months of tapering my benzos. Then 6 months to 4 years before I am through wd and PAWS from the benzos. 

What is the best course of action? At this point I feel that I need to get my thyroid stable while I deal with PAWS before I can taper my benzos. I am in a terrible place psychologically. Does this seem like the best thing to do? The benzos are perpetuating this cycle of depression, anhedonia and more. But getting off benzos is no easy feat and people in the community recommend the patient is stable and feels confident about trying to taper before starting.. I am neither stable nor confident. I am completely depleted of all neurotransmitters. I feel nothing day to day. All I feel is fear, cry a lot, am angry, sad and miserable. I am down to 1 mg of klonopin as I was able to taper in the past but haven’t started tapering again like I’d hoped. I don’t feel that I’ll be able to resume for some time.
