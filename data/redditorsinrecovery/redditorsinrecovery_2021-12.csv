I immediately went back and plugged into AA.

I’ve stayed sober the whole year and worked the 12 steps. They’ve been a great experience but now something isn’t clicking. Meetings have been making me depressed and something doesn’t feel authentic. I’ve tried switching meetings, talking to new comers and doing service but that’s not really it. I went to a refuge recovery meeting and it was nice to mix it up a bit. I also have some outside help. I also recognize it’s the holidays and this is a tough time.

I don’t want to drink but I’ve been thinking about using mushrooms again. I can’t tell if it is my ego or my intuition but they’ve helped reveal some things to me in my past. Some questions I have: What is sobriety to me? Should I stay in AA and go further or look for another path? What else is missing? Should I not use all substances?

I’ve already talked to my therapist and he is on board with me doing it and even offered to be on call with me if I need it. I also talked to my sponsor and he said that it would break his sobriety but if I need more information I’m going to do what I’m going to do regardless.

Yesterday afternoon, I attended a Christmas dinner with my daughter and her circle of friends. I only knew her and my son.

I brought my yarn so I could have some thing to calm me and help me not be so overwhelmed. After about two hours from that point, I hit a wall physically where I was so exhausted I could not keep my head up. I have never been that drained before in my life. I think that's because I've always drank to get through those hard social situations. I drank to be an extrovert.
Truthfully, I now get overwhelmed. I realize now that may be playing into my lack of meeting attendance. After working so hard as a teacher every day, I don't have the bandwidth to be present in a meeting from my share much less anyone else's share. I've got to figure out how I deal with this

**Basic Text, p. 25**

We are people accustomed to placing all our  eggs in one basket.  Many of us had one particular drug of choice that  was our favorite.  We relied on it to get us through each day and make  life bearable.  We were faithful to that drug; in fact, we committed  ourselves to it without reservation.  And then it turned on us.  We had  been betrayed by the only thing we had ever depended on, and the  betrayal left us floundering.

Now that we’ve stumbled into the rooms of  recovery, we may be tempted to rely on another human being to meet our  needs.  We may expect this from our sponsor, our lover, or our best  friend.  But dependence on human beings is risky.  They fall short of  perfection.  They may be on vacation, sleeping, or in a bad mood when we  need them.

Our dependence must rest on a Power greater  than ourselves.  No human force can restore our sanity, care for our  will and our lives, or be unconditionally available and loving whenever  we are in need.  We place our trust in the God of our understanding, for  only that Power will never fail us.

**Just for today:**  I will place my trust in a Power greater than myself, for only that Power will never let me down.

For the last 20 years I drank almost daily and went hard during family get togethers. My family loves to drink and I have childhood trauma that gives me a lot of anxiety. 

I’m 25 days sober and had an anxiety attack from hell yesterday. Literally laid on the kitchen floor for an hour trying to calm myself. I wanted a drink so badly to take the edge off. 

In treatment I had visualized my currency to have a drink as some kind of bill, but instead of monetary value it was sacrificing my amazing, supportive boyfriend, my two beautiful sons (10 & 4), my job as an RN, my family, and most of all, my self worth. 

This is the only thing that keeps me from drinking/using when I feel numb/anxious, which is half the days. I feel so much better today and it was a great Christmas. 

I get my sons tomorrow morning and just knowing I will be able to enjoy watching them open presents and not trying to secretly drink a hangover away with a coffee mug of wine is the best feeling.

First, I want you to know I have been sober for over 14+ years. I became an alcoholic because of my traumatizing upbringing. I ended up clinically depressed, with complex ptsd, amnesia, brain damage, and learning impaired, plus a bunch of physical problems. Currently, I live on disability.

The self-hatred and self-destruction my abusers (my mother and two older sisters) brainwashed me to believe about myself was buried deep. My family cruelly saturated me in their hateful words; I heard them so much; I came to believe them. I had no one to tell me different. Our brains record what it hears often enough. Isn’t repetition how we learn in school?  

I did not realize how much my upbringing tormented and tortured me until I cleared some of the hatred out of my head. I was used to it; I knew no different. I had to undergo hypnotherapy to reach that trash in my subconscious. Certified in it, my therapist did my sessions; I had been going to her for years at this point.

Today, I live grateful because it changed my life; I still have lots of problems, but my thoughts don’t punish me like they did. My mind is quiet, plus it is easier for me to come up with solutions and goals I can work towards. My self-esteem is healthier! I have read that the shape a person’s self-esteem is in determines how successful they will be in their life. I see that clearly now. I see my improvements over the years and how I manage better now. 

It's Heaven!! 

What I did was this, and it was scary to do, but I got through. If you have never done this, don’t do it alone. I needed my therapist's guidance through the first couple of times; after that I felt comfortable accepting other putrid fighting I inherited from my abusers on my own because I knew what to expect. So I caution you; don't start this on your own, please!

It was hard at first to even think about the thoughts I pushed away for decades of my life, but once I accepted them, they became weaker. 

I think you know what I am about to say: I had to accept HOW my family made me feel because the abuse and lies they pummeled me with hurt and damaged my feelings. I had to work to heal them, just as if I had cut myself. My feelings hurt, and I benefited from accepting how my so-called family wounded me. I validated what my feelings already knew. 

I recorded my hypnotherapy sessions so I could work on this at home in between appointments. Most days I listened to the sessions twice a day; sometimes three times. It was really painful, and it took me weeks of slowly making my way through those sad emotions, but I did it. I also watched sad movies that made me cry to continue to grieve over what they upset me over. Can you think of some movies that make you cry too? They might be helpful in this way, for whenever you are ready to tackle this. 

What astounded me was being able to think and talk about those problems without being crippled by them. I might cry a tear or two and my voice might crack, but I can talk about them. I don’t end up crushed like I did. 

Do you see that? The power of those words in my head that once stopped me dead in my tracks was much lower. 

Over time, I realized our brains record the information. Our emotions tell us what is going on around us and inside us, whether that is happy, sad, or any emotion in between. As I resolved more and more of what hurt me, my instincts became stronger as well. That really rocks!!

So, what do you think? 

Pace yourself; do this only if you feel it will help you. Your recovery path differs from mine. What might work for you could be a variation on this process I use. And if you don’t do this now, you might want to later on. 

It’s not for me to tell you. That is your decision to make.And if you want to, message me about your progress!",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7699884176254272}"

**Basic Text, p. 58**

The Twelfth Step reminds us “to practice these  principles in all our affairs.”  In NA, we see living examples of this  suggestion all around us.  The more experienced members, who seem to  have an aura of peace surrounding them, demonstrate the rewards of  applying this bit of wisdom in their lives.

To receive the rewards of the Twelfth Step, it  is vital that we practice the spiritual principles of recovery even when  no one is looking.  If we talk about recovery at meetings but continue  to live as we did in active addiction, our fellow members may suspect  that we are doing nothing more than quoting bumper stickers.

What we pass on to newer members comes more  from how we live than what we say.  If we advise someone to “turn it  over” without having experienced the miracle of the Third Step, chances  are the message will fail to reach the ears of the newcomer for whom  it’s intended.  On the other hand, if we “walk what we talk” and share  our genuine experience in recovery, the message will surely be evident  to all.

**Just for today:**  I will practice the principles of recovery, even when I’m the only one who knows.

**Basic Text, p. 68**

Tales of our antics in active addiction may  be funny.  Stories of our old bizarre reactions to life when using may  be interesting.  But they tend to carry the mess more than the message.   Philosophical arguments on the nature of God are fascinating.   Discussions of current controversies have their place—however, it’s not  at an NA meeting.

Those times when we grow disgusted with  meetings and find ourselves complaining that “they don’t know how to  share” or “it was another whining session” are probably an indication  that we need to take a good, hard look at how *we* share.

What we share about how we got into recovery  and how we stayed here through practicing the Twelve Steps is the real  message of recovery.  That’s what we are all looking for when we go to a  meeting.  Our primary purpose is to carry the message to the  still-suffering addict, and what we share at meetings can either  contribute significantly to this effort or detract greatly.  The choice,  and the responsibility, is ours.

**Just for today:**  I will share my recovery at an NA meeting.

I've done other drugs in the mix (Weed, Ecstacy, LSD) these past few years. Honestly I've been experiencing these cognitive issues since one day I had a bad high from smoking a lot of weed. I was using Meth but not on a consistent basis but it could be blame. I didn't start to fully get addicted until I really started having brain fog and it's been like this for about a full year. I stopped smoking weed 6 months because I knew it wasn't helping at all. With stimulants, I quit 3 months ago. 

Everyday I have a blank mind, I experience little to no pleasure in anything(nothing excites me anymore). Have chronic fatigue and constantly tired. Have a little energy through the whole day. Suffer badly from social anxiety that I avoid going out in public. Have very low self-esteem. Can't seem to be able to hold a conversation with anyone at all (even suck at small talk). Can't seam to speak coherently. My brain feels cooked.

But whenever I used drugs especially stimulants, I'd start to feeling like myself even though I think it was doing some serious damage in the long run. When I was in the psych ward and rehab, I felt like I was in a intermission. I started feeling more like myself. Could socialize better. Less brain fog. Actually made friends from there but being back in the real world, I feel so disassociated. I don't know if it was better when I had friends that could understand what I was going through.

Now I'm back to just being by myself constantly. I tried making contact with people outside from the psych ward or rehab but it either was unsuccessful or they just got too busy with their lives. I can't seem to make any friends at my new job. I mostly sit by myself on breaks. I don't know if this is because I inhibited myself from the real by either getting way too high and putting myself into an institution or some sort of delayed brain damage.

I did it through the 12 steps and AA. For the majority of my recovery, I worked a strong AA program. However, when meetings went virtual during Covid I stopped attending all together. During that year, I felt like I was constantly on the verge of relapse. I couldn't deal With the lack of my built in support system, and I didn't like virtual meetings.  I ended up taking an overnight job after getting laid off. I became extremely depressed and my waking hours were dedicated to arguing with people on Facebook about politics. At some point, enough was enough and I went to therapy for the first time. Therapy has changed my life. I also was formally diagnosed with a mental health disorder, which I am now medicated for and thriving. 
About 6 months ago, when meetings reopened, I joined a new Homegroup and went back to AA. However, I found myself being unable to stomach meetings. Something has changed, I know it's me, but am I at fault for that? I still speak to my sponsor every few weeks and she knows about my apathy. Recently she asked me if I wanted to leave AA for good. She wasn't saying it aggressively or anything like that, just putting it out there that my internal conflict with even continuing with the program seems like something I've been dealing with for a long time.

The following is a lit review. 
Harm reduction approaches to alcohol use: Health promotion, prevention, and treatment: “Although several studies have demonstrated that controlled drinking is possible and that moderation-based treatments may be preferred over abstinence-only approaches, *the public and institutional views of alcohol treatment still support zero-tolerance. After describing the problems with zero-tolerance* and the benefits of moderate drinking, the research literature describing prevention and intervention approaches consistent with a harm reduction philosophy are presented. 

Overall, *empirical studies have demonstrated that harm reduction approaches to alcohol problems are at least as effective as abstinence-oriented approaches* at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences.

Hi I’m new to the page. TL; DR is hubby has enforced a strict sobriety regimen on me (and himself to be fair) but as a binge drinker I don’t qualify for most recovery programs bc it’s a “problem drinker” situation vs an “addiction” issue. I have no intention of maintaining abstinence but I do want to regain my self control around drinking and I am in a TPT program. 
Here’s the issue and I’m hoping for suggestions. How do I help my husband understand that no, I will not be abstinent forever? We’ve spoken about it and he says he gets it but then informs me I won’t be “permitted” to start having a glass of wine now and then until I can prove I can do it in moderation.

I was not even a legal adult yet. I’m not going to go into what went on from 2011 to 2019, but I will just say I was on opioids on and off. There was a good four years of sobriety somewhere in the middle of that and at some point, all the usage picked up and amped up pretty severely. 

What’s important is that today I am 25 months completely sober and I’m happy. My goal in life is to change how people look at addiction, change how people look at recovery, and to reform the criminal justice system and the drug war. I know that these are bold goals and I don’t expect to reach them all or even reach any of them. But if I can change one person’s time perspective,  I’ll be happy.

It is my personal belief that most people are looking at addiction all wrong. I’m not talking about addicts. In fact, I look at them as blameless victims in this whole mess. I’m talking about the supposed ‘addiction professionals’. What’s amazing is that opioid addiction is one of the most deadly diseases for young people in the United States, but research surrounding the issue is almost nonexistent. They have spent almost no money on learning about the best solutions to opioid addiction yet they have spent a ton of money on incarcerating suffering addicts on trumped up charges For example, if someone has a half oz of H on them, it’s automatically assumed that they were selling. There could be concrete proof that their grandmother gave them the money and they immediately bought the drugs to use for themselves. They will still be charged with distribution and most likely sent to prison for multiple years. This, to me, it’s just one of many ways that the legal system is rigged against drug addicts. 

One of the biggest things happening within the drug addiction industry in the US is something called the Florida Shuffle. Essentially, private rehab companies that also operate halfway homes target drug addicts from all around the United States and sell them a pipe dream. They offer them treatment in a 30 day rehab and they market the facility as if it were some all inclusive resort. They advertise things like hot tubs, spas, the ability to use your cell phone, and more. They even pay for the patient’s flight to get to the facility. 

So basically, put yourself in that situation. You are a hopeless drug addict and it is the month of February and you live in New Hampshire or some other cold ass state. Those of us opiate addicts know how much more painful it is being dope sick when it’s 10 degrees outside. 


Maybe you’re dope sick 50% of the time you are miserable. You are not in the right frame of mind to make a life-altering decision. Someone on the phone is sweet talking you and offers to pay for a flight to Florida to a fancy rehab and promises you that when you get out of the rehab, you can stay in an awesome trendy sober living and start a new life. I remember being in rehab in Florida and I already had my living arrangements settle when I got out, but I swear to God, my entire stay at rehab they were pushing this halfway house and they were trying to make it sound like it was the most trendy thing. They even gave it a cool nickname and called it, “halfway” for short. Like, “what are you going to do when you get out, are you going to halfway?” Meanwhile there is nothing cool and trendy about these places. In fact, if you are in one, you are most likely going to keep it on the DL, or you are just going to get through it. That’s how I looked at it. When I was in a sober living, I looked at it as it was something to get me adjusted to sober life. Now, looking back at it in retrospect, do I think it helped at all? I have mixed opinions, but my answer leans towards, “no“, but that’s a whole different post. And I feel it’s a post worth making and I will definitely talk about halfway houses in the future. 


But let’s get back to that phone call from that guy in Florida who’s promising you the Florida getaway of a lifetime. Meanwhile, you’re not thinking straight. You actually think that this person on the other line has your well-being in mind. But they don’t. Your well-being is not even among their top 20 priorities. Their only priority is the money that you are going to make them. And you are going to make them literally thousands. Because guess how much that rehab cost? Anywhere from $15K to $30k. Sometimes even more. Guess how much that halfway house cost? If they can get you to stay for six months, that’s another three grand in their pockets. Oh, and let’s not forget their other urine test racket. They basically make you pee in a cup once a week and they charge the insurance company about $300 for that. So, essentially, you are a piggy-bank to them. And, they are using every manipulation trick in the book. They are bringing up the truth and splicing it with their narrative. They are telling you that so far, your own decisions have led to chaos, so maybe it’s best to let someone else ha for your affairs for a change. For them, this is a great tactic because they have a good point. Unfortunately, just because you are in the mitts of a rough time doesn’t mean you should let someone take advantage of you. Always be wary of people. Never in 1 million years does a stranger across the country want the best for you. The truth is, we live in a capitalist country. So, at any given moment, if complete stranger is being nice to us for seemingly no reason, It’s always a possibility that they have something to gain from us.

Anyway, this is the racket called the Florida shuffle. And basically, the Florida Shuffle isn’t best for your recovery. At that vulnerable moment, running away from it all and starting fresh feels like it’s the best move. But, when decisions are made that compulsively, there’s always something you are not thinking of. There’s always something you’re not considering.

When you are at rock-bottom and you are struggling and your life has caught up to you because of your fuck ups, it feels like the number one thing to do right now is to walk away from the situation you’re in and hit the ‘reset’ button. But, that’s not always the best choice. Granted, sometimes it is. But, we have to consider that different things work for different people. 

The truth is, next to losing a loved one, moving is one of the biggest life stressors. It’s in the top 10. In other words, even if you are a completely normal person who is not recovering from a drug addiction, relocating across the country is one of the most stressful things a human being can endure. Now, let’s think about doing that WHILE recovering from opioid addiction. To me, that sounds like a recipe for failure.

But like I said, every situation is different and we need to address the fact that for some people, going right back to the unhealthy situation you were in before it’s just not an option. And that’s a fair assessment. But there are ways to deal with this that don’t require you to pack up and move across the country. First of all, let’s say you lived in a big house where a bunch of people shared it and everyone was on drugs. Or maybe you rented a room from a homeowner and it was you and your significant other and you were both using. Or let’s say you lived in a studio apartment and right now it’s pretty much barren And there is nothing in it and going back to that apartment is going to make you depressed and want to use instantly. These are all very real situations. And, I would say the best way to handle them is to figure out a way to move back to the general area where you came from, but with modifications. And what I mean by that is call mom move in with your family if possible. Moving in with your family can provide you with structure that you didn’t have in your previous living situation. Maybe moving in with the family is not an option. For me, I fell under this category. In that case, sober living might be the best option. However, why pile onto the stress and go to a sober living more than a thousand miles away? It’s probably best to get a sober living arrangement somewhere near where you used to live. This way, you can learn how to adjust to life in the area where you came from. This way, you are not running from your hometown. You are facing it head on. And, you can wait however long you want, and then at some point you might have the ability to revisit your previous living situation or a different one.

Basically, what this all comes down to, is that a lot of addicts have grandiose plans to move to Florida with the girlfriend or Just pack up and move away thinking that this is going to fix everything, meanwhile all it does is suck up resources. And what I mean by that is, unless you have tens of thousands in the bank, if you just decide to pack up and move tomorrow across the country, chances are you are going to have to get rid of all of your furniture, a bunch of your stuff. If you have a pet, you light even have to get rid of them. And, all of this for what amounted to an impulsive choice that didn’t help you at all. 

And if you feel the need to pack up and move across the country in order to get away from a host of problems you have, at least do this much before making that decision: Google “change plan worksheet” and you will see A worksheet that is like a formatted list. Basically, right every single one of your problems down on that list. And then write down what you want to change. After that, you write down what you need to do to make those changes. And at least at this point, you will have a clear picture of what you are trying to run away from. And then, hopefully you can be honest with yourself and realize that moving away isn’t going to solve any of that. Rather, the only thing that is going to solve any of this is to actually work on the problems.

And, with all of that aside, it’s just unhealthy to make moving across the country a part of your recovery because a lot of times, attached to that are expectations. And I see this all the time. I see people who are unhappy placing huge expectations upon certain things and plans, all of which are temporary. Meanwhile, they are not addressing that inside they are unhappy. Basically, until they address that inner unhappiness, the problem will persist. And I want to see everyone happy. It’s important that we take care of our mental health. And moving or even going on a trip He’s not going to fix chronic problems like drug addiction. For chronic problems, we need chronic solutions.

So, I hope this makes sense to you guys. Basically, in recovery, we are dealing with some heavy issues. And simply moving across the country is not going to solve the issue. We might be looking forward to the drive over there. We might be looking forward to trying some new food. We might be looking forward to the sunshine. And, in those cases, I say maybe go for a road trip somewhere far away to clear your head or maybe take a day trip to a state park and get away from everything temporarily. Sometimes, we just need a reset like that.

After I moved out of there, I went to meetings less often but I did still go. I met someone and have been dating them since, engaged to be married in the fall!

At first, I was embarrassed to tell her about my past. Eventually though, I came clean, and she’s been supportive. Overbearing at times.

I suppose I'm writing this to reach out for support. After over five years clean, I relapsed about a month ago. It proceeded along these ugly lines:

\- Within a few days of 'normal' drinking at home, I was rushing downtown to buy crack cocaine. After paying a woman downtown to get the crack, we drive around smoking it in my car and she's convinced I'll kill her (paranoia). I finally arrive home to finish it, and the night ends with me weeping on the phone to the suicide prevention line. I could not believe what I did. I was so grateful I managed to avoid heroin.

\- After deciding that was a bit too much, I find coke and Xanax on the dark web. In some vain attempt to feel normal and connected to another person, I bar hop around high out of my mind alone, looking to start conversations with anyone I can. I eventually call an ex girlfriend and cause a terrible scene, insisting she leave me on the street to sleep, and 'just let me die'. I sleep it off in my car. Still, grateful I was too drunk to find heroin.

\- I half heartedly go back to a few meetings, terrified of checking in as a newcomer. At this point my sponsor knows.

\- I buy another bag of cocaine off the dark web. I again awkwardly bar hop, and manage to tag along with a group to a dance club. At 2:30 AM or so I finally work up the nerve to buy heroin, and I smoke it until morning. To top it all off, I had quit smoking cigarettes - and that's all out the window.

I'm desperately afraid of throwing my life away. I have a job and an apartment and savings. I have a relationship with my parents (who assume I'm doing great). I'm terrified that my window of opportunity is closing on me. I've had my issues with AA in the past (higher power, etc etc) but not willing to die over it.

My name is Irene, I m 32.

I always wanted to smoke as a child, the first time I tried a cigarette I was about 9 I'd say. I bought my first pack around 13 and became an addict right away. I discovered weed at around 14 years old and started to smoke daily when I was 15. From that time I tried everything I could and felt in love with psychedelics, mostly LSD, but also shrooms, salvia and DMT. Alcohol was already a big part of my life at the time.

My first boyfriend was a dealer and I spiraled down a coke addiction from 15 to 19 years old. We made a lot of money, traveled and lived on it (I left my parents house at 15). When I began to feel my body getting fucked because of the Coke I had to do something. To quit I decided to go away, booked a flight to India and got sober on my own. I stayed 6 month there, alone, and discovered ket and Mdma. I didn't like the K and never touched it again until this year, same thing with the Coke.

After a mental break down (psychedelics related) when I was 24, I entered another extreme addicted period. I went full on Opium during one year, along with anti anxiety pills at large amounts and amphetamine to be able to do stuff in between. After that period, my junky of a boyfriend left me and I got sober on my own again. I went through hell and never touched an anti anxiety pill again. 

I eventually put order in my life and went back to university. From the opium and pills period I was really into beer, everyday, still smoking pots from morning to evening. I got a bachelor and there I started to try to get sober. I tried to give up the drinking and the smoking maybe 80 times, no joke. The best I could do was a few weeks before relapsing.

This year I met a group of crazy people I got very attached to, they were all using. I was ready to go back into everything with them, but, amazingly I didn't . I took coke once, it was cool but didn't crave more. I took opium it made me super sick. I even smoked Heroin once again for the fun and that s it. Now I'm studying for my master, I gave up tobacco 3 weeks ago and took a vape. I'm five days without THC, first time in years, and 22 days alcohol free. And guess what? I m fine, like, yeah I get cravings and mood swings, but I m super happy to see my sober days counter everyday. 

If I manage to quit everything now, I must admit that my experience with drugs will be mostly positive. It brought me many friends and amazing adventures. It took my anxiety away when I needed it, made me see the wonders of life and love, let me sleep and wake up when I wanted, opened the door to divinity even.

 I would never say to anyone to go into drugs, it s a fckg dangerous game and I felt many times. But I don't regret. I took everything I wanted, smokes all the joints possible, drank hectoliters of beer and that s it, I saw it all, I want something else for the second part of my life. If I was asked the reason why I didn't fall into life threatening addiction, I would answer that I was very lucky, I had a very balanced childhood with loving and clever parents. The friends I lost on the way didn't have that. May them find rest where they are now.

Wish me luck, nicotine and alcohol are the worst, I'm still not fully convinced I will be sober for the rest of my life, but now, I'm getting high on sobriety and I can't wait to meet myself once I ll be done with the withdrawal symptoms.

**Basic Text, p. 31**

“Survive my emotions?” some of us say.  “You’ve got to be k\\idding!”  When we were using, we never gave ourselves the chance to *learn* how  to survive them.  You don’t survive your feelings, we thought—you drug  them.  The problem was, that “cure” for our unsurvivable emotions was  killing us.  That’s when we came to Narcotics Anonymous, started working  the Twelve Steps and, as a result, began to mature emotionally.

Many of us found emotional relief right from  the start.  We were tired of pretending that our addiction and our lives  were under control; it actually felt good to finally admit they  weren’t.  After sharing our inventory with our sponsor, we began to feel  like we didn’t have to deny who we were or what we felt in order to be  accepted.  When we’d finished making our amends, we knew we didn’t have  to suffer with guilt; we could own up to it and it wouldn’t kill us.   The more we worked the NA program, the better we felt about living life  as it came to us.

The program works today as well as it ever  did.  By taking stock of our day, getting honest about our part in it,  and surrendering to reality, we can survive the feelings life throws our  way.  By using the tools available to us, we’ve developed the ability  to survive our emotions.

**Just for today:**  I will not deny my  feelings.  I will practice honesty and surrender to life as it is.  I  will use the tools of this program to survive my emotions.

I'm a little over a month clean and have been going to NA. Ive been in and out of the rooms for 11 years.  I've always really struggled with the fellowship but not really with the steps or sponsorship.  I have autism spectrum disorder, am very introverted,  and also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Because of the way I am I find it extremely draining to be around people for real lengths of time and am pretty comfortable on my own.  I also am not neurotypical and am very different to most people especially when it comes to socialising. I am also gay - this is relevant and you'll see why soon. 

My problem is I've found a sponsor in NA who's very flamboyantly gay,  and all the meetings he goes to are gay and all his friends are gay,  and mostly all very flamboyant,  lots of drama,  and just VERY different to me.  People are very surprised when I tell them I'm gay.  I'm pretty chilled out and low key,  quiet and stoic.  My sponsor has become a ""friend"" and he's always calling me and organising stuff to do with him and at first it was good and helpful,  but now I find myself getting very annoyed by him.  He's also always trying to take me out to dinner and movies and stuff,  and it's just getting to be too much but as he's my only friend I've just been going along with it. 

I'm beginning to resent him but feel guilty about it because he's ""done so much for me"" and spent a lot of money on me.  But I just don't really like him to be honest.  He's like a girl and I find him really annoying but he IS a really good person has a good heart and means well.  He also keeps trying to get me to go to his meetings with him but I don't really like the other guys there,  just very different and I can't really relate to them.  I feel out of place. I prefer normal meetings with a mix of people not just effeminate gay men.  It also seems like these meetings have zero recovery and are just a social thing where they can all gossip and banter with each other,  while I'm looking for spiritual guidance.  I just don't really respect any of the recovery at these meetings.  

My question is - am I just an asshole and need to overcome my resistance to socialising with these people?  Am I wrong for dreading my sponsor calling me?  He calls me maybe three times a day.  Im starting to really resent the shit outta him for it.  

But IDK maybe I just don't like ANYONE,  or maybe I haven't found the right people yet.  I was supposed to meet him at a CMA meeting tonight but theres usually only 5 people there all with under 6 months clean time other than my sponsor who has 3 years.  I was dreading it all day until last minute made up a lie to stay home, do an online zoom meeting of one I actually like,  and chill out watch some. Netflix before bed.  

I'm just looking for advice on what to do.  I'm starting to really wanna leave NA again. I feel like I got myself into deep with my sponsor and it feels like he's suffocating me and I'm starting to hate him,  but I think he just wants to help me.

Trying to pass it on.,"A few years ago I was a year into my recovery journey, and let me just say it was fucking rough. I thought I was in a nightmare i couldn’t wake up from and I pleaded with god the universe or who ever every single day to let me feel something that wasn’t just depression, extreme anxiety, horrifying sadness, complete numbness. 

I came here almost daily to get me through, and one day someone posted “five years in, still noticing improvements every year!” And it gave me this hope… every single year I could get a bit better. So I just kept going at it. I worked my fucking ASS off to be the best version of myself. I worked out, ate healthy, got out of the house, did things that challenged me and made me anxious and even if they were failures I did it. I got my license, I became a student, I became a better mom.

And every few weeks or months or whatever I would have a day where I felt a bit better… and I held onto that feeling for dear fucking life and told myself “if I keep going, that will be my new baseline” and it did. And then that became the pattern, a day came along where I felt even better than that, and then THAT became my new baseline.

And let me tell you, that person wasn’t lying. Im FOUR years in now and I just started the most purest exciting joy I’ve felt in so long. And it lasts, and it’s beautiful. And it gives me fucking butterflies man, and I look the best I’ve ever looked, and people tell me I’m so fun to be around because I’m always so happy and excited about life and silly and my energy and joy for life is radiating outwards. 

I felt that and it’s dipped a bit, but guess what? The pattern keeps going. I hold on to that feeling and remember that’s my new target that’s just a baby step away, and the place where I’m at is fucking awesome and insanely happy already so I’m not even in a rush to get there man.

Think about it like this… when you’re using it’s a slow decent into hell. You don’t become your worst self, rock bottom in six months.

I’m an 18 year old freshman and college and 5 weeks ago I tried cocaine after a rough night with a girl. Didn’t feel a change at all and had no comedown, a week later I tried it again and again still felt nothing different. 

I haven’t done it since and have had no urges to do it, and was very happy for the last 4 weeks. 

However this past week I came home for winter break and am experiencing all the symptoms of withdrawl and I’m extremely depressed  and I don’t know why, I don’t crave it at all I’m just very depressed and have convinced myself I’m an addict. I’ve gradually gotten better but still feel very anxious and sad and have a pulsing sensation in the back of my head

Is it possible to be experiencing withdrawls 4 weeks later when the past 4 weeks have been completely fine.

Am I addicted and is this going to be the rest of my life or am I going to be my old self again. Please be honest.
Once again I have no urge to do it but all I can think about is that I’m addicted and am extremely depressed when I used to be the happiest kid in the world.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9732787609100342}"

For context I abused stimulants for almost two years, using them 3/4 times a week for functional purposes (was using 2-fma, an RC similar to vyvanse). I would also smoke weed and drink alcohol pretty regularly.

By the end of July, after my last exams, I started getting some panic attacks after my last binge and since then I feel completely broken.

I have lots of problems nowadays, I have trouble reading, thinking, can’t even hold a conversation with my closest friends because of the brain fog, coordination and bladder problems, have 0 libido, vision problems, memory problems, basically I feel completely retarded. 

It’s been 5 months since I quitted everything, apart from drinking 2/3 times a month and things are not getting better.

I’m really starting to feel hopeless, lost my job, stopped studying, I’m loosing friends…. I also have a huge college debt to pay and I just feel hopeless because I can’t do anything.

Spent all my savings on doctors and psychiatrists and none of them was helpful…

Could some of you share your personal experience, what were your symptoms and how long it took you to recover?

**Basic Text, p. 82**

Love is like an elixir for some of us.  The  excitement of a new lover, the intrigue of exploring intimacy, the sense  of release we get from allowing ourselves to become vulnerable—these  are all powerful emotions.  But we can’t forget that we have only a  daily reprieve from our addiction.  Holding onto this daily reprieve  must be the top priority in any recovering addict’s life.

We can become too involved in our  relationship.  We can neglect old friends and our sponsor in the  process. Then, when things get difficult, we often feel that we can no  longer reach out to those who helped us prior to our romantic  involvement.  This belief can lay the groundwork for a relapse.  By  consistently working our program and attending meetings, we ensure that  we have a network of recovery, even when we’re deep in a romance.

Our desire to be romantically involved is natural.  But we mustn’t forget that, without our program, even the healthiest relationship will not guard us against the strength of our addiction.

**Just for today:**  In my desire for romance, I will not ignore my recovery.

I did every drug I could get my hands on but downers like heroin and benzos were what I mostly wanted. At the end of my active using, I had been Narcaned 4 times and survived 2 seizures from benzo withdrawal.

    I have been attending NA since I got clean and have really done my best to learn about the steps, something I didn't do in previous attempts. I have an amazing sponsor who doesn't hesitate to tell me the truth and for the first time outside of my mom, I've felt like I love someone. I really don't think about using much these days. Something I thought would never leave me.

     But I seem to be struggling and it feels like things are getting harder. I started writing on the 6th step and I know I need to change patterns and thinking or go bacl to using and I'm scared.

     I'm having a lot of trouble just being. Like my life has gotten a lot better. I have my own place and im more independent, I'm clean, I have people that really care about me and want me to do good. Nothing major is going on besides wanting a new job and feeling discouraged I'm not getting any calls back.

     I'm struggling a lot with codependency and social anxiety. When I'm not in a relationship with a woman, I am filled with thoughts and fears. ""I'm going to die alone."" ""I'm never going to have a family."" ""I am missing out on my young years."" ""I am ugly."" ""You are getting older and missing out on when you are most attracted to women."" And it's really becoming obsessive to the point I'm looking up how to be better with women but the end result it feeling hopeless because I have always been quiet, shy, and struggled with confidence in that area. I was in my 20's before I even kissed someone. It's is really becoming painful and I am struggling to live in the present. 

     I have this image of the man I want to be in my head and it's so far away from the man I am. I feel shame for struggling with this issue. It's like I'm still chasing that thrill of a women being interested, the first sexual experiences. At times, it feels like the only thing that really excites me.

     I am working on positive affirmations and a gratitude list like my sponsor has told me to and I'm sticking with it. I'm back in the gym, trying to get in shape again because last relationship, I quit going to the gym and got heavy again because I have a pattern of doing that when I start seeing someone.

    It's been feeling like this is how its always going to be and I'm scared. I don't want to be codependent, I love sex and I love women but its like I am trapped in a person that doesn't feel comfortable around them and women aren't stupid, they know. I'm struggling to see how I am going to remain clean because fuck, this shit feels lonely sometimes. Like there is a part deep inside that cannot let the guard down. Like I can't feel closeness with many people.

    I guess I wanted to vent. Addiction is kicking my ass in this area and I don't always like talking about it at a meeting because it makes me feel kinda like a loser or undesireable or unlovable. My sponsor keeps encouraging me it will get better. It won't always be like this. I feel like the steps are my only option because its the only thing that has ever kept me clean this long but I am struggling to feel happy. I should feel happy I am clean and living better but the depression got pretty severe when I had covid and for a bit after where I didn't even have energy to get out of bed. 

     I hate this disease and I hope the other areas get easier to manage like the not picking up has.

Long story short it was the worst advice I've ever listened to and over the next 2 years i slowly went from 2mg daily to 8mg and then weaned myself off slowly currently its been about 7 months without them and i feel fine but just been struggling with anxiety and depression and the only thing i can pinpoint is withdrawing from subs. Has anyone else ever felt like this after stopping subs? I don't think i ever needed them in the first place because i kind of hit a point in my recovery where i know what will happen if i relapse and just kind of got baited into getting on them for the cash grab from when i was still in a sober living. Currently i moved back home living with family and it just feels like they took my spark away from me. Not worried about cravings/triggers those are at the bottom of the list for me. Just feels as if i lost my drive and motivation and feels like I've spent all this time getting clean and now I'm 25 and having nothing to show for it. Never really struggled with depression/anxiety but i just feel beaten down and i know for a fact that i felt great before i got put on them.

ive taken xanax on and off since i was 14 years old. for the past almost 3 years now its been consistent usage because i got a prescription. i am still using but trying hard to wean off with the help of my girlfriend. obviously at this point id benefit most from professional help but its expensive and i have a hard time taking my own experiences and hardships seriously. id be guilted by my mother if i chose to seek professional help because im on her health insurance, i literally want to get married to my girlfriend so i can be on hers instead and i can go no contact with my mom. 

anyways, i have a prescription for 60 1mg pills, this time i made them last like 16 days. my tolerance goes crazy and i end up having to wait two or three weeks in between prescription refills so theres a time period where all i feel is withdrawal symptoms and pain and its fucking awful. i cant sleep for more than 3 to 6 hours at a time, i wake up in the middle of the night. im having diarrhea this time which ive never had before honestly. i get a headache every day and eating sucks and isnt fun but thankfully i smoke weed (lifesaving plant in my opinion, and not something ill ever give up) so it can help sate these symptoms a bit but its a constant craving. all i want is some fucking xanax. 

to be fair to myself im doing way better than i have in the past- the last time i refilled my script it only lasted seven days. going through sixty pills in seven days is insane. i was out of my mind. i recently saw videos on snapchat from a year ago where i was just visibly barred out and talking, slurring my words and losing my train of thought. i hate seeing myself like that. i hate that its been a year and im still on this evil drug even when ive said multiple times now im gonna stop going back to my doctor for it. i hate that my girlfriend has to help me with this and i hate when she sees me high. im doing better, im not buying bars off the street anymore to supplement my prescription, and i got my dosage upped so i can take less and go through the pills slower. but its still not over and im not at a point where i could ever see my life without xanax. its sad and painful.

im just posting this cuz i hope maybe someone relates, someone older than me or with more experience, or maybe someone who has recovered fully from a xanax addiction and can tell me its possible to do. i dunno. i guess i needed to vent to like minded people. thanks for reading if youve made it this far.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998658299446106}"

I am away at uni, but it's been hard to study, and I found myself relapsing again. Nothing else helps to alleviate this stress. I remembed how truly empty I feel without codeine. When i'm on it, everything is fine. I wish i never had to come down. I've been trying to take doses as small as possible, but I fear falling face first into addiction again if my dog dies, and if it happens, I have no money at all to pay for addiction treatment.

**My Present to Myself**  
I am sober. Today. Today, I am sober. Today, I have not had a drink. Today, I will not have a drink. Tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day. I don’t know if I will have a drink tomorrow. I will think about that when tomorrow comes. I won’t worry about it. I won’t ruminate on it. I will wait until tomorrow to decide. Today, now, this minute, I decide not to. I remain sober. I am enjoying this moment, staying in this moment. I will leave the next moment for The Future.  
The Future is there, looming, weighing down on me. It wants me to think “what if”. It wants me to worry about what it may bring. The Future advances on me, relentless in its inevitability. It will bring what it will bring. All I can do is live. Live now. Live well. Live proud.  
I will not fight The Future. I will wait for it to be The Now and I will embrace it. I will wrap my arms around it and immerse myself in it. But, not until it is time. Not until it is Now. And Now, I am sober. Now, I choose life. In The Now, I do not drink.",49,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9960930943489075}"

We were supposed to have the first family Christmas is 13 years. That's not happening thanks to my brothers. 

I am part of a large family and my parents are my only advocates. My mom told me if I wanted to travel the 600 miles for Christmas that I was welcome, and anyone who had a problem with it could not show up and that was their problem. 

All my brothers told her that if I was allowed home that they wouldn't talk to her and cut communication between her and the grandkids until she ""got her head right"".

She called me balling her eyes out saying how sorry she was and that she still wants to see me. However, for her sake, I told her I would respectfully back out this year until my brothers are ready. 

It broke her heart and it tore me up seeing how she was manipulated. That being said, I'm going to turn this into motivation to reach out so no one has to cry like her. 

If you're alone this Christmas season and need someone to chat with, hit me up! No one has to be alone this season. We are all in this together and get through this by sharing our pain and figuring out ways to move on. 

No matter if you're welcome or not, you are loved and worth loving. Don't let the exclusion seperate you from everyone. There is always someone to talk to and I'm always here for anyone that needs and ear. 

Take care everyone and happy holidays 😁",34,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5029412508010864}"

I have a little over a month clean. I've been addicted to almost everything but heroin has always been a constant. IV cocaine and meth were probably the most problematic though and I feel like they have done the most damage to my psyche, and have damaged my brain significantly, although I'm hoping most of the damage is reversible in time. My question is kind of abstract but I can't seem to find any stability in my routine or mood. Sometimes I try and force myself to wake up early and do all the 'right' things - meditation, journalling, step work, exercise - but it takes soo much out of me to have a 'good, productive' day that it takes me like 2 days to recover from the effort and I end up just being a vegetable. Left to my own devices I can sleep like 12 hours a night. It's really discouraging because it takes soo much energy and effort to not just be a bum. However, sometimes I feel really motivated and life seems relatively easy to do all these things.

My question is - is it always going to be a grind and a struggle to override my natural instict to sleep all the time and just watch TV? Or will I eventually be able to be an adult without so much of a struggle. I'm feeling really discouraged at the moment. I just feel empty and at a loss of how to help myself. Is early recovery always this hard? My max amount of clean time is 9 months, and I've been in and out of 12 step programs for 13 years. I won't stop trying, but goddamn it's so hard.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987473487854004}"

It may piss some people off. Basically , I was a bad alcoholic/drug user. I did do a year in AA and was able to successfully break my habits. I'm at a point in my life where I hardly drink , maybe once a month, but I smoke weed every day. I'm productive, healthy , and have ambition. I'm seeing a therapist, doing yoga, meditating, life is good! However when I do drink I go overboard and I really do some damage to my life and people that rely on me as a friend and family member. 

I'd love to work a program where I can work on the drinking, but can keep smoking weed as that isn't my problem,  it actually helps me! I respect AA and I wouldn't feel right getting high and participating. My therapist mentioned s.m.a.r.t recovery which sounds interesting and I guess more custom to qhat my goals are?

They work in an artisanal brewery and love talking about different types of beer and drinking beer.

I've never had any problems with alcohol but i don't drink because I'm sober. My friend used to constantly offer me beer but i told them I'm sober. They continued so i told them hey, I'm an addict in recovery, i don't want to drink and i don't want to be offered drinks.

Since then they talk about beer less but still do. Theu haven't offered me beer which i appreciate. I get their passion and am happy for them. Not sure if it's making me want to drink if at all but seeing a person passionate about alcohol, a drug, and drinking it daily and being alright and not being totally dysfunctional due to it kinda is triggering me.
