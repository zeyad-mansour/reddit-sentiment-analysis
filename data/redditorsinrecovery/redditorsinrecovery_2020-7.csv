This year my anniversary didn't carry much meaning, it has become just a number, like my birthday. I remember how the 6th or the 9th year had much more weight to me. It was the first time this year i celebrated a little, i told some people about it and they expected a cake :) so i made one.

I just listened to Janis Joplin and remembered all those people i knew who died of fucking overdose, suicide or ""accidents"" while being high. It hit me hard. All those wasted lives. I still have depressions, i still suffer from cPTSD, i still have a eating disorder and i still crave occasionally for drugs. **But it's getting better.** The depressive phases became shorter, i can deal better with the PTSB and i make baby step progress with my eating disorder. I learned to play music, i learned painting, i found poetry, i started to form real friendships. All this was only possible because i stayed clean (or started again after a relapse, i first stopped taking drugs \~14 years ago)

I say: it's worth the struggle!

Now that I'm 11 months clean, I've thought about it and I'd really like to work somewhere in the recovery field or anything that has to do with substance abuse. What kind of jobs are out there? I know a lot of positions require bachelor's or master's degrees. And I'd like to go back to school and get at least my associate's. But I have a high school diploma and almost a year of clean time. I know about recovery coaches and treatment assistants at detoxes/rehabs. And one program told me in order to become a recovery coach, you need 2 years of clean time with 500hrs of volunteer work (plus passing some tests/taking some courses). But what other options are out there or whats something I can do in the meantime until I hit 2yrs next year? I'm flexible and would love to do literally anything that has to do with helping addicts & people struggling with substance abuse. Also are there any courses I should take?

Hey all, porn/erotica addict here. I was clean for about 4 years after finally getting caught red-handed, and started going to Sexaholics Anonymous. Unfortunately my schedule changed and none of the in-person meetings in my area worked out, so I stopped going to in-person meetings. I relapsed twice over the next two years, only got caught the second time. Wife nearly left, I checked myself into overnight psych observation because I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself (although I know intellectually I'd never do it.). We've reconciled and are moving forward together. She's semi-active in COSA and it helps her a lot. It's been about 4 months since last relapse and its fallout. 

I could've been going to phone meetings once the in-person meetings stopped working w/ my schedule, but I didn't. After relapse I did 90 meetings in 90 days w/ a Daily Sobriety Renewal format; now I'm going 3x a week and doing 'step work' or reading from the White Book on most 'off' days. 

Thing is, the 'step work' I have is through this 'Steps to Freedom' workbook that I don't really feel like I'm getting anything out of. It mostly just asks me stuff I already know and understand, although admittedly I'm only a little ways into step 2. But the questions are so detailed and specific that I can't come up with an answer for a lot of them, even after sitting and sincerely pondering the question for a while. 

Often when my wife gets an emotional trigger, she asks me ""What's different this time?"" to which my answer is ""I won't stop actively working the program ever again."" 

But I'm not really sure what that looks like. What does 'working the steps' mean, and what does it look like? With all the COVID stuff going on there's no in-person meetings in my area. Do I need to get a sponsor again? If so, how do I find one that works for me? I've had a sponsor once before but we didn't really 'click' and he relapsed and stopped coming to meetings anyway. 

So what am I supposed to do? I am willing to do the work, but I don't exactly what that's supposed to mean or what it looks like. I could really use some input here.",2

I had been smoking weed every day for almost 3 years, drinking vodka all day every day for a year, got a DUI, etc. My life was falling apart and I couldn’t function. It was either get sober or off myself because i just couldn’t live like that anymore. I went to an inpatient rehab for a few weeks, got out and started intensive outpatient, eventually graduating to regular outpatient (mostly because i was going back to college and didn’t have as much time to make it to the facility). I won’t say it was easy to get to this point. There were definitely hard times and days where I wanted to drink or smoke weed, but by going to meetings and talking about it I was able to remain sober. I gained back the trust of my family, my girlfriend, people can count on me now. But these past few weeks have been extremely difficult for me. Nothing has been going particularly wrong, there wasn’t any terrible event. I just really want to fucking drink or smoke. I wanna feel different. I want an escape from myself, from my own head. I’m on naltrexone, which really helped for a long time, but lately i don’t feel like it’s doing anything. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to relapse and have to start all over. If i fall off the wagon I know it’s going to be so hard to get back on. But i can’t keep feeling like this. It’s like this gnawing desire to just...escape? To get some relief? I don’t know, it’s difficult to describe. Maybe some of you will understand.

TLDR: I’ve been sober for 7 months and I didn’t really have a desire to drink in that time but the past few weeks the desire has been intense and relentless.",18

2020-07-22 22:51:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hw7vt3/127_days_off_alcohol/,127 Days Off Alcohol,"Hi there, I don't usually post here, I usually hang over at /r/dryalcoholics, as my biggest problem was my drinking, but that's not my only addiction.

Overall, I've come a long way, and I'm incredibly grateful for that. However, I have to recognize that removing one drug didn't solve my problems. If anything, it made them all the more clear. And still, I've been running away, living effectively in denial.

 I still smoke weed. And a decent amount, few joints throughout the day. Sure, not ruining my life, but it's still holding me back. Recently I went a grand total of 4 days without weed. It was hard, but I had my girlfriend with me. I was far away without access to any, so I accepted it. I meditated. I attended meetings. I journaled. I played music. I read. I did those things I wanted to do. I noticed my days felt longer and I had more energy.

Once I got back home, I got weed delivered that night. And since that, I have been on a binge. An everything binge. My days have been spent playing online chess. One more thing to obsess about, and like video games, gives a false sense of accomplishment. 

I'd much rather smoke weed than drink. And I'd much rather play chess than play video games. But really, I'm using these substances and behaviours in the exact same way.

And porn. Wow the porn. This is something I have not dealt with, but it is a problem. Weed, chess, porn. That has been my day for nearly 2 weeks. No meetings, no meditating, no writing, no reading, no music.

I did buy and ride a bike and got to see people so it wasn't a complete waste of a week, and better than any week drinking, but I'm not accomplishing any of my goals and I'm sick and tired of this. I'm still the little boy that doesn't want to do the work, I'd rather play my games and stay in my little world, where nothing matters as I have no obligations. And touch my pecker a bit too much.

This is where I'm at. I heard something the other day and really resonated with me. I am exactly where I need to be right now. Look down, that's where I am on my path. Recovery is not straight, easy process. Ups and downs, and if you don't let go, you get dragged along. Switching one addiction for another is like switching seats on a sinking ship.

I'm away again, with no weed. Can I make it a few more days? Sure I can. I know I can. But I still bought a pack of cigarettes today, despite being 124 days cigarette free and ~38 days vape free. Ah well, that's part of my recovery too. I can forgive myself, one day at a time.

Not sure what my point is. My mind is a bit scrambled to be honest. Reaching out and sharing has been the most important part of my recovery.",45

About 2.5 months under my belt, and frankly, things don't seem much better or worse. I thought I just had anhedonia, but it's deeper than that: I have virtually no control over my thoughts, mood/emotions and general cognition. This in turn leads to Absolutely no focus, racing thoughts/uncontrollable overthinking, intrusive thoughts and unexplained, unpredictable shifts in mood, energy level and everything you can imagine. Worst of all, even though I can't focus on one given thing, it seems like my random thoughts always gravitate towards something negative. One moment, I'm worrying about some stupid existential bullshit I don't wanna think about. The next moment a headache (from TMJ) is capturing all my attention. The next moment, I'm worrying about something else.  **It's like trying to catch positive thoughts/emotions are like ice cubes: slippery, really hard to hold onto and melting rapidly. Negative thoughts/emotions, however, are like velcro: easily caught and hard to shake off.**

**Pre-stims, I'd had anxious tendencies where I'd overthink or ruminate on distressing shit. Regardless, I was pretty much always able to find something positive to focus on and generally get too absorbed in life to let intrusive thoughts and anxiety fuck with me. Now, given the post-stem anhedonia, utter lack of focus and racing thoughts, it seems I just can't shake unwanted anxious thoughts. I just can't ever feel good. Feels bad, man. Anyone else?**",20

We've known each other since we were 7, we were kinda friends but not really - if that makes sense. It was in jr high and high school that we didn't run in the same crowd anymore. He def. gravitated towards people who were doing some not great things. Although his dad passed away when we were 10 (heroin, but his drug of choice of coke, crack and meth/ basically any form of speed) my boyfriend still ended up dabbling in drugs. It started with him just smoking weed, no big deal. But the issue was he started drinking and then one by one he would say yes to more stuff. I know he's taken prescription meds like ADHD medication, he has done lean a few times, taken some pain pills/ smoked blunts with pain pills in them and then all of this eventually led to him saying yes to cocaine. 

 He was doing cocaine everyday, multiple times a day, from the end of 2017 until the start of 2018. He went into the air force so he had to stop everything he was doing, ended up being discharged because he barely failed his drug test in basic for weed. He came home and did cocaine one more time then quit for good. 

  So he has been sober from about December 2018 until now. We're both 24 so it's a weird situation because on one hand I feel like we're so young and it's weird to think it even got so bad at our age, but on the other hand I went to a huge party school that actually has an issue with sugar babies to fuel cocaine addictions - so I get it. 

 I am someone who NEVER got into drugs as a teen and I've never done anything 'too bad'. I didn't drink for the first time until I was 23 and honestly the total amount that I've drank since then is less than some people are drinking in a night of partying. I smoke weed occasionally, honestly the harshest thing I've EVER done is a fat dab. 

 This makes it hard for me to know what is a normal 'oh in high school' story vs. a story about addiction. Like I never grew up thinking doing drugs was normal or anything so my boyfriend will tell me stories and be laughing about it and I just sit there because I don't think it's funny.. like I want him to talk to me about anything he wants to but when he actually tells stories about being bad off on drugs and is treating it like a good memory it makes me uncomfortable. 

 Yesterday is a perfect example. We were talking about people working in the steel mill and how dangerous of a job it is - literally someone has life altering injuries or someone days every few days, which is obviously why they pay so much. We were talking about how when one of his friends worked there he would end up making around $100/ hr during his mandatory overtime etc. and this somehow turned into him talking about them doing coke (and yes, I know this friend did coke with my boyfriend and I express my concerns about that a lot). He literally told me that him and this friend would do a ton of coke then my boyfriend would DRIVE this friend to work at the steel mill - where he could have killed himself or others - and how this friend would just be there working for up to 18 hours a day with no sleep and coked out of his mind because him and another one of my boyfriend's (old) friends would sit there all night and just do coke legit every like 30 or so minutes - literally every time they started to come down from the high. When I hear that I hear something terrible, my boyfriend tells it like it's hilarious. 

  Is this a coping mechanism? Like is he telling me stuff that bothers him and he is just laughing because he's uncomfortable? Or does he legit think this is funny/ okay? Because if you talk to him about coke he will tell you how awful it was etc. but then he'll tell you a story like this (which is an AWFUL story) and be acting like it's funny/ a good memory...",14

I also went on a *trip* and found it very meaningful. I laughed for the first time in ages. A gut busting smiling so much your face hurts kind of laugh.

Well, pretty much everyone knows that I relapsed. My old sponsor and my old sober living room mate just showed up at my house, looking very concerned, disappointed, said some somewhat condescending things.

I want to do the right things. I also want to do right by me. And if an occasional dose of something has helped me so much, maybe that is something, as an adult with 4 years of hard work sobriety has the prerogative to do.

&#x200B;

2 days ago, after group, I must've had a panic attack. I think it was regarding me having to move from one base to another. My mind went on straight autopilot. I went to the store, bought a bottle of Robocough (DXM), went home, and had the whole thing. It was only 300mg luckily for me that's not TOO bad. However, I'm on anti-depressants, and one thing for sure is DO NOT TAKE DXM ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

My body must've knew I fucked up, because something triggered the ""throw up your entire stomach contents NOW"" about an hour in. I did, but the stuff was already absorbed by my body, I didn't see the pills in the mess of puke I made. So here I am, alone in my room, with a shitty chemical in my body that I can't get out, I said ""alright, guess I gotta ride it out now.""

The trip was AWFUL. When I mean awful there was about 2 hours of come up anxiety, 2 minutes of trippy closed eye visuals, and then a day and a half of comedown. I had a splitting headache and my entire body hurt like hell afterwards, pretty much my bodys way of telling me ""what the fuck dude"".

I regret it so much, I was doing so good. The last time I used DXM was the suicide attempt which is 49 days ago. The sober streak ended, but my path to staying clean won't end. I'll remember what this felt like for a really long time. Especially where my head was that day. To the part of me that wanted that stupid drug, fuck you. You hurt me. You hurt me real bad.",5

I've been having a great deal of anxiety lately about possible brain damage from drug abuse that lasted about 2 years (ages 20-22).

I was very reckless when it came to drugs and partying. The dangerous combo I'm terrified may have caused permanent damage with my brain is Phenibuit and alcohol.

I've been lingering over the possibility I could've caused CNS depression that could've led to respiratory depression that may have caused permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen in the brain.

I only did the dangerous combo four times but when I did I drank a decent amount and took atleast 5gs. I have no way of knowing if I stopped breathing those nights since I was blackout. It's been over a year since I last used Phenibuit.

I've always had mental health problems (probably the reason I made such reckless decisions) I'm afraid i'm getting dumb and I'm feeling depersonalized more times than not recently.

It could be that stress and anxiety are causing these symptoms but I can't help but be fixated on these fears at all waking hours.

What kind of brain scan would I need to find out if I fucked myself? Is there any treatments for this or am I SOL? What are the chances I sufferered from respiratory depression and not need any medical assistance? Would any nootropics help or would I just be digging a deeper hole?",4

That’s not my intention but Isint it ? Really I put my needs first when I picked up right? I’ve been an addict since my teens, on everything one time or another. I’m forty now and still don’t wanna give it up I guess really.... or I would have thought twice before affecting my family like this. Everything’s great in our lives but me lying and using. That also means that unfortunately  the bad traits that come with addiction out weight any type of person I could be no matter how good my heart and intentions are.  I started a.a five months ago, haven’t picked up alcohol but started smoking pot more which was ok cause it wasn’t my d.o.c. The COVID hit my routine was tossed away, no gym, didn’t maintain structure. That was where I fucked up first... then I went camping took some of my wives phentermine, and in my head I was fucked. I had to tell my sponsor I was smoking  which he was fine with which in turn just gave me an easy excuse to continue riding that fence. Then addersll  for the last month or two , no gym , no meetings, hardly reached out. I couldn’t stop. I knew I was in a bad spot and had to get back. I had to tell someone. I didint have the balks to pick up another white chip. I really needed a friend, I told my wife. She was furious and for three days even though I wasn’t using and was trying for a restart she still accused me. Now here I am. Wife’s gonna probably leave again. I don’t blame her. My word means nothing. I don’t even know why ,I never stopped to think about the repercussions. Hey but I’m not drinking right? I’m just writing this to whoever reads this rant. Because I just want someone to understand. I’m sure some have been there. I hate this . I hate using, but I sacrifice everything positive for it. I just wish my wife could know that I’m always on our families team. I wish that I could believe it also,now as I write this I see the irony.
What the fuck are we without our word? Just a soul floating with the tide. No control.  Nothing good about us . Just  a liar, and  an addict once we break our promises. I’m proud of you guys out there battling this. Keep it up. I’ll be fine. Maybe I’ll grow the fuck up before I’m dead.   Love you guys.  I don’t know where this post belongs lol...",4

Being out of school, living alone, not able to go to my usual meetings, my mind started to get the better of me and I dabbled again in psychoactive substances/ Shit hit the fan fast. Luckily everything is fine.

I got sober because the girl I was using with was scaring me, because she was acting like me. It occurred to me how lost I was at that time. I realized how much of my life I was letting pass me by. And how much I was hurting my loved ones.

After two mornings of waking up with that old feeling of dread, which I hadnt felt in years, I realized I was off track.

I messaged the mother of teh girl in question. She has been MIA for over a year.

During the 4 years Ive been clean, I went back to school and am almost done with my associates degree., I have built relationships with my family, and I have found myself.

I can see how easily I can undo all of that.

I have been struggling with loneliness. Been feeling old hurts. Unable to ""find the girl"".

I just wanted to express myself and reach out to anyone who feels like I do.",16
2020-07-09 19:50:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hoe9h5/how_i_think_i_got_better/,How I think I got better,"I struggled with a substance abuse  disorder for just about ten years. During most of that time, I had essentially given up on the prospect of ever having something approaching a normal life. I expected to die from my illness, and I almost did, and I have a scar bisecting my chest to remind me of that fact. But, somehow, I did get better. And since I did it, that means other people can. What works for me won’t work for everyone, but in the interest of helping those who I can, I’ve decided to share my thoughts on what I think is helping me. 

How did I do it? 

The honest answer is that I’m not sure. And the other honest answer is that it’s dangerous to call myself “cured” and pretend like it’s all rainbows and butterflies from here on out. I’m sure that bad things will again happen to me, as they happen to everyone. And I’m sure that I’ll make some bad decisions. I’ll probably have days where if a rig magically appeared in my hands, I’d be tying off in the next second. But I’m a year sober and feel like I have the tools I need to stay that way. (I’m sure there are some people reading this who are thinking “just a year? Just you wait.” To which I say - go fuck yourself). 

There are several things that have helped me - mindfulness, first and foremost; therapy and medication to a lesser extent; changing my conception of addiction from moral failing to mental illness; and finally, several conceptual strategies whose main purpose is to increase compassion for yourself and others, and to hopefully increase connection with others - the usefulness of which I rank up there with mindfulness. Goal setting, too, is extremely, extremely important, but maybe a little obvious, so I won’t elaborate on it. 

I’ll start with therapy and medication, because while they can’t help you truly create your life as you want it to be, they can save it. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything else without first stabilizing myself. Therapy can take a lot of forms, but I personally consider CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and “positive psychology” type therapies the most useful. CBT is a pretty standard, almost universally accepted form of therapy, valued both for both its efficacy and its efficiency. In short, it allows you to identify the areas where your thinking is distorted, and to challenge them. You might worry that since you failed one time, you will fail again and again, or you might not even consciously think this but behave like it’s true. And CBT allows you to assign that type of thought to the “not useful and most likely not true” category, and you can start to move on. Therapies descended from positive psychology mostly focus on unconditional positive regard and on acknowledging the validity, if not necessarily the usefulness, of your feelings. It isn’t really a discrete form of therapy as far as I know, but it is a good foundation. 

—-

Medication, weirdly, is a touchy subject for some recovering addicts. There’s a certain sense, in some circles, that if you are using any type of psychoactive medication to help you stay sober, then you are not truly sober. This is an utter crock of shit, and I feel it is barely worth the time to write about it. But since the idea harms some people, I will. MAT (medication assisted therapy) saved my life. MAT has saved the lives of many other people. In any other circumstance, there is nothing wrong with learning you are ill and taking a medication to help you. All medications can be misused to some extent, and yes, in the hands of an addict there is certainly more potential for misuse. But it doesn’t mean you’re still an addict if you need mood stabilizers, or suboxone, or methadone, or whatever else, as long as it’s used responsibly and in the service of a larger goal. Ideas like this keep people from getting the help they need, in favor of sometimes totally unrealistic abstinence based techniques. It also ignores the fact that addiction isn’t purely a matter of physical dependence. Addiction is a mental cloud that mediates your every interaction with the world; when you aren’t well, most choices an addict makes revolve around how they might impact their ability to use. MAT it is not. 

———-

I grew up thinking addicts, and really most other people with mental illnesses, somehow deserved it in one way or another. They must’ve done *something,* or they must just have had no will, or no character. They weren’t fully *human* to me. But dramatic irony sometimes happens in real life too, and I would end up becoming exactly the sort of person I once hated. And I didn’t realize it at first, because I had internalized a lot of the toxic ideas found in our culture about mental illness and addiction, but I hadn’t really chosen to be that way, and no one truly does. You get there stepwise, slowly. You’re born with certain traits, and you’re raised in a certain environment, and for a certain number of people their traits combine with their environment to form mental illness. All this is to say that it really helps to contextualize any mental illness, but addiction specifically, as an *illness,* and not as a character flaw. This idea is starting to take hold, but not nearly enough. 

————
Finally, mindfulness - to me it has been the most important tool I have, and I believe it will remain important for the rest of my life. 
I am by no means an authority on the subject, but in just under a year of attempting (and mostly succeeding) at integrating mindfulness into my daily life, it has become more beneficial than I would’ve ever thought possible. It’s a very simple practice, but paradoxically extremely difficult to maintain, because of the way the human mind works. In first starting your practice, you’ll find that it almost seems pointless - you try to focus on the breath, or your heartbeat, or the sounds in the room, and you keep finding yourself lost in thought. But this *is* the point. It allows you to watch how your mind normally works while you aren’t paying attention. How thoughts just pop out of nowhere and derail attempts at concentration, or how negative thoughts set off a chain reaction that culminates in your feeling terrible, all without you really knowing what’s going on. And it, finally, after much effort, teaches you that you don’t have to identify with every single thing that goes through your mind. You are not your thoughts. You are a million other things. You’re the sound of waves crashing, or a beautiful piece of music; you’re the sensation of your lover’s hand in yours, a feeling of warmth, or chocolate melting on your tongue; you’re the color blue, or a painting, or the way the sunlightdances through the blinds at the right time of day. It may seem like I’m trying to be poetic, but I’m being literal. All these sensations take place in the same space as your thoughts, so why would you give your thoughts primacy? It is an extremely freeing, expansive way to think. 

Additionally, I have a few conceptual strategies I use. The most important one, I think, is to imagine yourself as a child. I know this might sound a bit silly, but I think it works. It’s easy to feel all sorts of negative things about yourself as you are now - why did you do *that*?, or why didn’t you? Why did you hurt this person and not that one, and why did you hurt yourself? What about all your regrets? But everyone can have compassion for a child, and everyone was once a child. Didn’t you, when you were young, deserve to be happy when you grew up, regardless of the things you might’ve done since then? Didn’t you have dreams that were worth trying for, as “unrealistic” as they might’ve been? Didn’t you deserve a life as free from suffering as possible? I think that when thinking about yourself in this way, it’s almost impossible to entertain the usual recriminations and self-doubt that can normally occur. 

The second strategy is, to put is simply, compassion. Having compassion for others is sometimes hard, especially if the object of compassion is a certain type of person. But you find that in cultivating compassion for others, in trying to find joy in someone else’s happiness, or in trying to have sympathy for someone else’s pain, you’re doing these things for yourself at the same time. You realize that we’re all, despite our differences, very similar - we all want the same things, even if not everyone has the best ideas about how to get them, and that if you can extend this feeling to others then you can also extend it to yourself. And even in the absence of actual connections with other people, real compassion for others can still foster a larger sense of connectedness. 

The third strategy comes from mindfulness. You learn, when paying close attention to your thoughts, that you aren’t as in control of them as you may feel. They come, and then they go. There’s really no stopping it, excepting the few moments of “pure” mindfulness you may experience after practicing for a few months, at least. Even when you don’t realize you’re thinking, you actually are - almost every experience is filtered through the prism of your current thoughts. And if you aren’t fully in control of your thoughts, in the same way that you can’t control the next sound you hear, or the next sensation you feel, you realize you don’t have to follow them. They’re just another aspect of consciousness. Important, amazing, useful, even miraculous - but not so different from any other feeling or sensation that may cross your mind. You can look at them, acknowledge them, and use them if they’re useful and discard them if they’re not. This is an incredibly valuable thing to realize when dealing with cravings, or negative ideas, or sadness, or anything else, really. I’ve found it’s even useful to apply this logic to positive emotions - yes, this is nice, and I will enjoy it, but I won’t become attached to it, and feel worse when it’s gone. Because I used to feel like I was doomed to live out my days in the pit of hell, but then I escaped, and this taught me something, something that I can apply to any negative experience or thought in the present moment: this, too, will pass.",8

I have been dating an addict for 2 years, he was sober for 2 years.  We met on tinder (yeah yeah) and it just ended up working. He had an open mind, loving heart, and amazing intellectual and emotional understand of who he is and what he wants.  Or so I thought.  A little over a week ago I found out he had done heroine. He told me he was visiting a friend he knew from his past, he was bringing him and his girlfriend food! He told me how his friends girlfriend was crying about how sweet my boyfriend was and how amazing he was for bringing them food and hanging out.  Our roommate (my boyfriend's friend, they met in jail) was home for a little, he travels a bunch for work, and he noticed my boyfriend was super off. I had noticed earlier he was nodding off and acting kinda weird. Long story short after a short group talk my boyfriend expressed that he had stole some kratom from me that someone gave me about a month ago and took it all. Mind you when I realized I couldn't find it I thought I just lost it, long story short my boyfriend had stolen it and ended up buying a bunch more. After he expressed this incident our roommate asked if he had done anything else. He said he hadn't, I had stepped away to cool off and try and understand everything, my roommate didn't believe him so they took a drive together to talk. They were gone for over an hour and while I was waiting for them to come back I knew, I felt sick, I knew he was going to come home and tell me something I didn't want to hear. And that is exactly how it went down. He told me he had done heroine, mind you he wouldn't have told me unless his roommate encouraged him. I didn't know what to do so I just left, I left the house and never wanted to come back. In the end of the night I asked for my boyfriend to leave the house stay with a friend (a good one) and he did. The next day he pretty much acted like nothing had happened, he did apologize but it wasn't enough for me honestly. After long talks and trying to understand we are trying to work things out. But here is my issue... He is a compulsive liar. He lied about when he visited his friend and his gf, he constantly goes through my phone and accuses me of anything he can, he lies about literally nothing, and doesn't address how to move forward in life. He would rather sit there and say ""I can't do anything right.. you don't love me.. I'll never be enough... I fuck everything up.."" I understand he feels that way and I cannot imagine the emotional and physical stress being an addict hinders your life. However if he can't stop lying and accusing me of cheating/leaving him I will never be able to be happy again. 

I guess my long story short is:
What is your opinion/experience with compulsive lying and addiction?
Would you recommend supporting him or does he need to do this himself?
Will he ever be trustworthy?
Am I hindering his growth because he is so worried about disappointing me?

Thank you and please anything helps, if it relates to this specific post or you think it's just good information please teach me and help me understand.
Thank you",4

It took me 12 years of getting 30-60 days (never more) if I was lucky at a time. Then I hit a bottom so low, i was so tired of being locked up, tired of ODing and being saved with Narcan. 

I surrendered and hit my knees and cried in a cold jail cell locked up by myself. I allowed myself to cry and ask my higher power for help. I knelt with my hands on the wall and cried until I was sure God heard me.

2020-07-07 13:14:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hmyowi/1_week_sober_from_alchohol/,1 Week Sober from Alchohol,"Today a week ago was my last drink. I'm proud of myself! I made a series of bad decisions while drunk that led me to lose so much. It's unbelievable to me that it took such a great loss to finally start my recovery. But I'm glad I'm finally here.

Before a week ago today I was in denial that I was approaching rock bottom. I was watching myself spiral down and half denied it. The unfortunate thing is that I got good at hiding my problem from my friends, roommate and partner. I have been working two jobs for almost 5 months now. All I did was work. I didn't know I had it in me to work so much and so hard. My main reward was to drink in between shifts as much as often as I could and just enough so that I could show up to my next shift sober. A day didnt go by that I didnt have at least 4 drinks. I gave myself the excuse that I needed them to wind down. 

I soon discovered that working graveyard shift didn't matter as much because I worked completely alone. On these days I would drink in the morning or midafternoon and then sleep the rest of the day off. I became unreliable to my partner and absent. In my absence she stopped trusting me and would occasionally accuse me of being somewhere else or with someone else. But the truth was that I was too drunk and ashamed to contact her during the worst moments. I could never bring myself to tell her I was struggling because I was so ashamed. I didn't know what was worst, that she would decide to stay with and live through it or leave me. 

Showing up to both jobs or dates hungover became a regular thing. It was exhausting. I was always tired from not getting good sleep from all the drinking. Eventually I resorted to calling out and not showing up to work at all. The main nights I did spend sober were when I stayed with my partner in her house. Even then I would find a way to always get a drink in. All of the new activities we were doing involved drinking. If I knew it would be that kind of event I would always sneak a shot or two before to get a heads start. I was always the one in the group that drank the most and pushed for everyone to follow. At this point my tolerance was so high I barely enjoyed drinking with other people. 

I tried so hard to make my drinking look casual. I thought to myself that as long as no one made a comment about it then it wasn't noticable. It started to be obvious on how unreliable I became and unethused for life. This trend always led me to my worst depressions. My worst depressions led me to drink more. I stopped loving myself completely. I gained weight and lost interest in everything. The only thing that kept me going was the love of my partner. But I realize now that was such a heavy weight to put on someone. Our relationship grew strained and eventually ended. 

I made a lot of bad decisions because of my bad unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Ones I can't take back or even fix. I find myself alone now and I'm finally ok with it. I have come to realize that I cannot keep bringing good people into my life and expect greatness from if I don't correct my toxic behaviors. I was by definition toxic.

I have had this problem for over six years and the repercussions of my decisions have and are continuing to cause large rifts in my relationship with people that are close to me.

My problem has come to a point where I am now lying on default, and often times I'm lying for no reason at all. I'd like to see if there are any community groups that people might be able to point me towards, or otherwise have any resources/advice on how I can work on my problem. I haven't had much luck finding communities by googling liars anonymous. Thank you all very much.",23

My little brother just went into inpatient for fentanyl. I have no experience with fentanyl so I am reaching out to Reddit for help. 

The goal here would be to send him a letter while in rehab with words of encouragement and advice from Reddit. I've been sending him cards daily because we all know how much those mean to us! Looking for some outside perspective maybe someone who has been through this. What words do you wish you had herd while you were in recovery? Or any words of advice would be really helpful!

2020-07-06 19:56:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hmjljk/considering_this_a_win/,Considering This a Win,"I work at a hospital and it's been a difficult few months, but an especially hard couple of weeks. A couple of days ago on my birthday (yes, I was born on July 4th. No, I don't like being born on Independence Day - I actually kinda hate it.), I saw a video a friend had shared on Facebook. It was of a guy making a large bowl of an alcohol-filled fruit drink with a little soda, like for a party. I was sitting there thinking ""That looks really good - if you take out the alcohol."" Then I thought about how much more alcohol I would have put into it if I had been making it myself while I was still actively drinking.

In 10 days, I will be 8 months sober. I've honestly lost track of how many times I have relapsed - the last time I relapsed, I gave up my longest period of sobriety, which was just over 1 year, 4 months. I am feeling really good about my sobriety right now and am really proud of how far I've come. I've even got friends now who, although they aren't recovering alcoholics, they don't drink and they support my recovery as best they can and are understanding.

At the risk of sounding HELLA cliche: I never thought I'd say this, but I am grateful to be in recovery today. It is one of the hardest things I have ever done and, with the help of my friends, I am living a much happier, healthier life. To quote The Beatles: ""I get by with a little help from my friends.""

Thank you for letting me share!",4

I was looking through the threads here and I noticed a few posts about alcohol withdrawal and seizures. I’ve never thought about or worried that happening to me.

I’ve gone weeks/months before without so much as a shake. 

I’ve been to several mental health facilities and I’ve always been told I’m an alcohol abuser, but but an addict. I can go without and be fine, but if I have 1 drink, I have 5.

The past few days Ive been drinking every night. Before that I went about two weeks without with a little anxiety at night but after about three or four nights in, I was able to fall asleep and not really have any worries.

I guess I’m making this post because now I’m afraid that even though I’ve never experienced withdrawal symptoms, could I still possibly have a seizure or some kind of complication?",5

I am almost 28 years old, female. I have close to two years clean from a really nasty heroin addiction. I got clean after my fiancé passed away and have a lot of my own traumas stemming from dark places my addiction took me. I started going to school for Alcohol and Other Drug Counseling and am a couple semesters away from my certificate, although I think I’m gonna keep going for a bachelors. I got a job at a 90 residential treatment center for women and prenatal women or women with kids under 12. I started in the end of March. I was head over heals in love with this job and it quickly became my life because helping other women is my passion. After about a month and a half my background check came back with warrants in another state and my job allowed me stay with the intention of letting me clear them up. I got a $2 an hour raise for “my hard work and dedication during covid-19” not too long after the background check. I am working with my lawyer to sort this background thing out, but I may get probation and that could mean losing my dream job at least for a couple years. There is possibility of suspended sentence which would mean I could keep the job, but I’m not sure. I am so anxious about all of this and am constantly going into work thinking they will find out who I really am or they will get tired of waiting for me to get it straightened out. I also have these feelings of not being fit for the job. Sometimes I feel like I am just not good enough and that I am not emotionally stable enough to be helping other people at this level. I do a good job, but this job can be so emotionally draining and I am so new. My supervisor just threw me in and is expecting to catch on and be great, but we are so understaffed and it is so difficult! I get so wound up about this stuff and it effects my job performance as well as my personal life, which is basically non existent anyway. I am just reaching out I guess to see if anyone has a similar experience.",52
