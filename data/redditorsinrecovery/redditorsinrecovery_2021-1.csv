This hasn‚Äôt been my first time trying to quit but has been the longest period so far. Since I stopped it‚Äôs not been something that I‚Äôve gone without thinking about on a daily basis - not always in an extreme way but it always pops up at some point. I‚Äôve found it tiring lately to reason with the weird inner dialogue that I have about having a drink. I don‚Äôt have the same distractions that I had pre pandemic, like going to work and to the gym, and I‚Äôm just alone with my thoughts about it so often. 

Although exasperated by the isolation, these feelings have been with me in some way since I stopped drinking and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I feel like I just keep pushing through to the next day but like pressure is continuously building or something. I just don‚Äôt always feel like I have this total control over what‚Äôs happening in my head to keep this up forever, but I also know that I don‚Äôt want to go back to how I was living before - I‚Äôm just feeling tired of the push and pull.

I don‚Äôt have any friends who don‚Äôt drink because they have issues with it and because of that feel like I can‚Äôt honestly discuss it with them in some ways. All of this to say, I‚Äôm seeking some advice or support or whatever behind the veil of the internet lol. 

Should it be this tough over a year in? How do people manage sobriety successfully for entire life times (maybe too big of a question haha)? Is the push and pull feeling a common experience?
Anyone have any words of wisdom or similar experiences?

I'm now eight months out from the marijuana and Vyvanse overdose that made me give up both. I still feel pretty awful.

What worries me is that I don't really know if I'll recover any more than I already have. There are two scary variables here:

1. I was prescribed Vyvanse in the first place because a few years ago mononucleosis seems to have attacked my brain and caused some problems: chronic fatigue, brain fog, depression, loss of libido, flattened emotions. It feels like my brain is swollen all the time.
2. Something really bad seemed to have happened during the overdose. Parts of my vision temporarily went dark. In the days after, it felt as if I could only have one thought at a time, like they just sparked slowly in my brain, disconnected from each other. My body felt weird to me. Sometimes, for example, I would try to use the restroom, and my brain felt like it was ""looking"" for the right parts to use. I'm worried I did permanent damage.

These days the fatigue is worse than it was before the overdose, the feeling of my brain being swollen is worse, the depression is worse--I just feel so hopeless. Leading up to the overdose, everything in my life was already falling apart. Now it's fallen apart further, and I don't understand where I'm supposed to get the energy to even begin to put it back together. I spend my days unable to stop thinking about every shameful thing I've ever done, about how there's always seemed to be something off about me, and about all the people I feel would actually enjoy my suffering if they knew the full extent of it. These are horrible thoughts, but I have no will to fight them. And yes, I'm seeing both a talk therapist and a psychiatrist.

I'm aware that people see improvements past the eight month mark. I'm aware also that it may not be surprising that recovery seems unending in the middle of a pandemic. And I am taking steps to improve myself: I read every day, I exercise at least a little, I've been playing video games and piano to stimulate myself. I'm not taking this lying down.

But some days, like today, I just get really scared that this will be my life now. I'm scared that between the post-viral syndrome and overdose, my brain is so trashed that I'll never really enjoy life again.

I'm one year sober now, so actually got sober during the pandemic. Towards the end of 2019, I was at my ultimate rock bottom moment and I don't think I'd have lived much long if I'd have gone on using and drinking the way I did. I've been sober since January 3rd 2020, so almost 13 months now. In the beginning, I actually felt healed. As in the opposite of white knuckle sobriety. I genuinely didn't want to drink and didn't even have any cravings. Most importantly, I felt 'connected to the universe, in spiritual alignment.' I guess when the quarantine just started last year, there was the novelty of (re)discovering my sober self, attending online meetings with people from all over the globe,  playing musical instruments, practicing gymnastics etc. I even went back to college and everything was amazing. As in, I was actually living my dream. 

But in October, something happened which probably made me go into shock mode. I then felt completely detached from the rest of the world, and especially from the AA programs. People advised me to do as many meetings as possible, to do an 11th step meditation etc.... which I tried but it didn't work. I'm not blaming it on the program, I'm blaming it on myself. So I know this is not a 12 step sub, so I'm also exploring other ways to remain sober. 

Lately though, there's so many people relapsing. A lot of them are blaming it on the pandemic. But if so many people around me are relapsing, I kind of think ""why not me?"" 

I'm so glad about how far I've come but I just feel so empty, so hollow. So the thing that's basically missing is a feeling of happiness, of fulfilling a purpose or something. I've heard from people around me that relapses only make their condition worse.  A lot of them have said that the amount they consume doubles. I absolutely don't want to go back to those hangovers, arrests etc..... actually, just looking at a person drinking from a bottle in a movie or something triggers my gag reflex.",30

Except 2 months in ‚Äò16; half gallon a day 3-5/7days a week) , but **currently**, I‚Äôve been drinking minimum one 12 pack (max 2) of twisted teas maybe a few vodka nips every. single. day. Since last week of September. Mostly started drinking like that because I stopped doing hard drugs.  

I‚Äôve detox myself from fentanyl multiple times in the past 2 years with no issues, first time I was sober for almost a year, relapsed when my bf got out of prison (and once when he first went in) in April ‚Äò20, then back and forth from when he died from an OD June 31st until I got off the dope during the last week in September(was already off since Ithe end of July but somebody stole my suboxone and I relapsed again, detoxed, now here I am) and that‚Äôs when I started heavily drinking again. I don‚Äôt even care about the dope really . but I‚Äôm worried once I detox from the suboxone my cravings will come back full force either that or go back to shooting coke (my DOC. Only did dope here and there to come down before suboxone habit) 

I got a suboxone habit *before* the actual dope habit from the same bf referenced above, that started October of 2018. Haven‚Äôt even tried to detox from that. I‚Äôve tapered myself down the past 4 months from half strip to a little itty bitty corner piece and can *sometimes* get those 3 days in before feeling shitty. (Mostly extreme restlessness, generally uncomfortable, sweats/chills) 

Drinking has been a lot harder to me to stop because of how accessible it is especially when the liquor store is legit a 2 minute walk. I already had RLS since I was little so I can‚Äôt get completely off of it by myself. I just can‚Äôt and I need help. 

**Here are my questions**

What‚Äôs an estimate of time will I be in the **detox** itself? About a week?

From your experience do you *think* they would most likely give me Librium for the alcohol withdrawal? If not could I ask if they‚Äôd consider?

I have state funded insurance. (MASShealth- Fallon) would they help place me in a halfway/sober house? I honestly don‚Äôt know the difference. 

What are basic services most detoxes offer?

It‚Äôs hard because I am so used to being able to relate to others in my peer group. We all share the same disease and there‚Äôs a way to get better. There‚Äôs literally a list. 

I haven‚Äôt told anyone other than my husband and parents about what my doctors are saying. My final test results come in this week. I‚Äôve been keeping it together around my 2 year old. I don‚Äôt want to drink but I do want to escape - that is what scares me.

2021-01-23 05:07:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/l39k28/modded_minecraft_addiction/,Modded minecraft addiction,"Probably not the usual thing here, but I'll share what I've been up to.

I'm not exactly sure if I can even call it an addiction, maybe 'obsession' is the better term. Because I feel there is some 'meaning' in playing it. I feel like it's teaching me lessons and I have to finish the pack because. . .  Because justification ABCDEtc. For those unfamiliar - an 'expert pack' is a set of nested automation tasks, the game is basically a factory simulator where you put together >9000 lego blocks to reach some final items. However it's also like Animal Crossing and you can make things all pretty - a balance between aesthetic and logic.

From the rational point of view it's plain to see that Minecraft and specifically modded is very good at hijacking your basic animal survival/achievement drives and sense of completing tasks - like Animal Crossing but more extreme, more like a really OTT power fantasy. Not a fantasy in the sense you would dream about it, but power in the sense of seeing numbers go up, like watching your bank account rise. Like Cookie Clicker or idle games with extra steps. The real good shit that makes you feel like a total lab rat, like that feeling when you close your YouTube or social media tab only to immediately open it again. You don't even really enjoy it but at the same time you feel like you should just do it a bit more. Like how someone told me; Men can binge on How It's Made documentaries, learning survival tips, or watching sport, specifically stuff like UFC, etc. pretty much indefinitely. Because that simple circuit of 'Ug dug. Provide. Give tribe shelter, make tribe safe' is drilled into our fucking spinal chords basically. And women can endlessly watch makeup tutorials and follow social media trends, drama, etc. I'm not trying to make a sexist inference, both can be just as degenerate as each other. Just pointing out it's easy as f to get strung up on these hardcode hooks.

I imagine it's similar to being a workaholic. And funnily of course like most video-game 'addicts' I have no job no partner no responsibilities. A huge escape. Though I still keep up fitness, hygiene, cooking, etc. I have done the typical addict thing of deleting it like 10 times only to reinstall and restart. Binge for a week then delete it. Binge for a day then delete. And now I feel like I have to 'get it over and done with' in a way. Like the reason I come back is precisely because I didn't finish.

The reason I post is basically because of that. I am mentally split all the time. One part of me, the 'good' part is saying that it's a huge waste of time, the other is saying; yes, it is a waste of time, but that's your conscious choice to be hedonistic and a leech. Then of course that is immediately followed by the third voice: It is all about balance, if you only play for an hour a day it's perfectly fine. Quite similar to the 1 more drink 1 more hit, etc. mentality. Though that's my internal debate: Play in moderation or not at all.

Over my life I've been a very extreme, perfectionist person that never finishes things. So that's how I justify it to myself philosophically. That continuing to play is the moderate decision, quitting will lead to more extreme mentality and derailing. That's - just one way, how Minecraft as a game and 'art' can feel healing.

Just gotta actually stick to my limits, haha. . .   I kept thinking, that you have to construct life like a game, the way Jordan Peterson, Mark Robber and many others have talked about. Or how Sam Hyde put it; Some people are so bad at achieving anything that learning how to work out or win at a baby's game might actually help. Bleh. .

Anyway, there's all my rationalisations. Curious to hear other's thoughts.",10

I am here because my boyfriend struggles with addiction. He recently checked in to rehab for the third time. This time, it was his decision. He says he did for himself, me, and for our future. 
I am wanting to help him through it. I just don't know what to do to help. Idk if he needs to be completely clean. No weed, alcohol, etc. He did heroine for many years and quit that. He was put on suboxone, but he also wants to quit that. When he relapsed, he took Xanax, did cheese, and something that looks like oxy but it's way stronger (he said people have overdosed on this pill). That's when he decided to go to rehab, because he knew he had messed up and disrespected me by relapsing. 
I honestly was more worried about him than I was mad. I didn't get on to him. I didn't yell. I was calm the whole time. He would sit next to me and tell me he's sorry he relapsed and cry on my shoulders. He said he wasn't even thinking about doing them, it was more like he was just on autopilot and it happened. 
How can I help him? What can I do? How am I suppose to be? Do I baby him? Do I get mad? Should I be on his ass about stuff? Should I be ""toxic"" and go through his stuff? Do I remain calm? What do I do when he gets out?

It took about 9 months of being sober before the anxiety subsided. Now it's come back. The tiniest of situations cause my anxiety to go crazy. Telling myself that there is no need to get anxious, or that the situation doesn't matter doesn't help at all. It's slowly getting back to the level that it was when I first stopped drinking.

I've also had no ability to feel any kind of pleasure since I stopped drinking. I have no desire to do anything, and nothing makes me happy. I've been to the Dr. every month since I quit. The Dr has tried 13 different anxiety medications with no results.

Basically, I'm restless, irritable, and discontent. I feel myself getting back into the same cycle that I was in when I was drinking, and I don't see any way that this ends except for me drinking again and/or dying.

I've tried meditation. I've tried all the meditation techniques that they taught in rehab, but it just makes me more irritable. The medications that the Dr has given me haven't done anything. 

I know that going back to AA would help, but that's not an option right now because of COVID. Basically, I'm just lost right now, and every day I get closer and closer to just giving up and drinking again. I know it sounds stupid, but drinking seems to be the only thing that brought meaning to my life. I realize that the meaning it brought was evil, but I'm starting to think it was better than where I am now.

But she only made it into her fifties, due to a slow death as the result of a lifetime of active alcoholism. I remember visiting her on her last birthday back then. I think I gave her a Stephen King novel, because she was a fan. She was visibly pushing towards the end, hiding a myriad of medical conditions from me, as I learned later. But even as I saw her get worse, I just did not think it would end just yet.

We hung out that day, smoked, watched tv and she cooked me some lunch. I went back to my place then, and that was the last time I saw her. On February 15 I got a call at work and the rest is history.

I barely remember her, 15 years later, and I barely remember my real mom, the sober one. That is probably because I'm fighting any memory tooth and nail. The last thing you want to do is sit in 2021 like a broken mess and ugly-cry about missing your mommy.

To end on a happy note: I'm sober today. I don't have to end up like my mom. I have a solution. And for that I am really grateful. Alcoholism has wrecked my life ever since I was born, first secondhand, then first hand. My own alcoholism is arrested today, just for this day, by a limitless and loving higher power who keeps me safe.

Theres other amends I cant make, namely with my father who is on his deathbed and still wont talk to me or attempt to meet his new granddaughter. That's an issue I will probably need counseling for, cause at this point the hate kinda goes both ways... I wasn't ever Really terrible to my dad. Not pretty, but not evil either.
Anyway just wanted to get this off my chest to folks who get it. Wish me luck.

Edit: Yes, I'm familiar with the literature on these various drugs.",14

I had a hard day today. But here I am, still sober at the end of it. 

It‚Äôs the first day of a new semester and I had several new (anxiety-inducing) things on my plate. A wrench was thrown in to my carefully crafted day plan and my emotions got the better of me because of it.

I was scolded today for not ‚Äúgoing with the flow‚Äù. Reader, let me tell you, there was no flow. It was a shit show. The wrench was an absolute shit show of an attempt by an irresponsible party to claim ‚Äúorganization‚Äù 10 days too late. And I am expected to pick up the slack for it.

I am working on my ability to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, to understand that a lack of preparation on someone else‚Äôs part does NOT make an emergency on mind, but also to recognize that I can‚Äôt change anyone. This is a situation I HAVE to let go of, otherwise it could be very detrimental to me. 

I need structure in my life. Absolutely need it. But I also need to learn to let go of what I can‚Äôt control. 

Happy to be here. Happy to be sober.",18

My first stint of sobriety lasted 7 months before I relapsed because I had issues with my local AA fellowship. But I learned that I was truly in fact an addict. When I chose to get sober again I took it much more serious this time, and sought out other methods of recovery than just AA (mainly CoDA, more work with my therapist, and focused on my emotional sobriety above all else).

Today has been a really off day, idk why, I just woke up feeling off. It's my time of the month and my body is just EXHAUSTED and even though I went to a meeting earlier in the day it didn't really help. I have another meeting at 8 and luckily it's my home group and seeing everyone will make me feel better. But it REALLY didn't help that my neighbors decided to smoke up the entire building with weed so much I almost couldn't breathe. Then I went to a vape shop to see if they could fix my vape pen (cause I'm trying to quit smoking cigarettes now) and just EVERYTHING is about smoking weed and being a stoner and for the first time in a REALLY long time I started missing it. I missed being able to live that life, and it made me wonder if I could ever smoke moderately again, if any part of me could ever go back to that life. I know that's just the addict in my brain talking, because I tried that when I first relapsed and obviously I learned that none of that can be true for me. 

99.9% of the time I LOVE being sober. I feel so great not needing drugs or alcohol to feel okay and I've even curbed most of my nicotine addiction (not getting a new vape pen), and I KNOW how much my life is better without it. But sometimes, in that .1% of time, I really miss that part of my life and feel sad that I can't go back. And idk, I just wanted to get it out somewhere. I'm not nearly close to using, have no way to use even if I wanted to, and I'm just having one of those ""good ol' days"" moments and I know it'll pass.",31

When I looked at some of the answers someone had put every time I use heroin. Now I‚Äôve been clean for 6.5 years but this simple question just hit me that way. Then seeing someone answered it exactly how I was thinking has me a little off today. I am so grateful I‚Äôm clean but I‚Äôve been thinking about something a friend back in the day said. We were both wasted and he looked at me and said ‚Äúdamn man I don‚Äôt think humans were meant to feel this good‚Äù. That guy overdosed a couple years ago but what he said didn‚Äôt mean much when he said it. A few months later when I got clean it became a phrase I would tell myself when I wanted to use. After reading that question it still seems weird to me that something that brought me to the brink of death. The thing that helped me give up my will to live is the first thing I think of when the word comfort is used. I think I‚Äôm just ranting I‚Äôm actually kinda shocked.

1. My maternal grandmother's health issues have taken a turn for the worse and her husbands (my grandfather) was diagnosed with cancer in early-to-mid December and started hospice less than a week before Christmas.
2. My mother has been in the hospital for the past 24 hours or so. I originally brought her in for psych help due to her being actively suicidal and they learned that she was in DKA, so they admitted her to the MICU this morning before transferring her to a general medicine floor this evening.

Between these two things and some other stressors, I've been really wishing I could drink like a normal person. I find myself wishing that I could just get drunk to take the edge off and then wake up and not continue to drink. However, I'm also finding that I'm wishing I could use drugs. Because I'm an alkie and addict, I know that either of these would be a relapse, which I don't want to do.

I know I can stay sober and I feel a strong push to do so, I just really needed to say something to people who understand what addiction recovery is like. I know I need a meeting (I'm thinking of trying to do a phone/online meeting when I get off of work in the morning). I really needed to say something, though, especially since I work in a hospital. While I don't have access to any of the meds in the hospital, I still felt the need to express that I'm somewhat struggling before the desire to drug/take certain types of meds became any stronger.

(Last week).After being clean for a little over 2 years. I have finally moved on from feeling ashamed and guilty about it and I feel more sure that I want to live a clean healthy life.

The biggest thing that really made me feel ashamed was having to call in sick at work.. I feel so proud to finally be working because I spent such a big chuck of my life just being an addict and not doing much else. I can now truely my see how far I've come and how quickly getting high is a steep slope backwards. I think in my head before I did it just recently the urge to do it had been building up for a while and I had convinced myself that working and being sober didn't make sense.. I think I was a little bored of my whole routine, and after doing it I was so miserable and felt so detached and had no desire to do anything. I realized. I love who I am sober, I love the strength I've found in myself that for years had been buried under the drugs. My ability to push myself harder than I knew I was capable of. I like how much more comfortable I am with myself and with others  people. How I have conquered my anxiety.

I think it's really easy to beat yourself up when you have a lapse in recovery but I think looking at the big picture is important and it's what brought me out of the slump I've been in. As an addict I'm not going to beat myself up being disappointed  I reverted backwards I'm going to remain proud for my time clean and greatful for my continued desire to move forward.",17

I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and last month my anxiety spiked once I tested positive for Covid. I started out taking .25 mg of Xanax two times a day and have cut it down to either .25 mg or .50 mg once at night, since that's when my anxiety has been getting really bad. 

I finally got with a psychiatrist and was prescribed lexapro and am on day 4, and now I want to tackle getting off Xanax, but how should I go about this? I have 2 mg bars and can't split it any lower than .25 mg (even splitting a .50 mg piece results in a chalky mess) each, so would it be safe to eventually go from the .25 mg once a day to none? I've heard of the possibility of seizures, and I know the amount I'm taking is pretty small in comparison to what I see people taking here, but it still sits in the back of my mind. Also, how long would it take for symptoms to go away? Any answers would be greatly appreciated",20

I got in with a bunch of young guys in recovery who became my roommates and had the time of my life.

I got a sponsor and worked the steps. I had a year off work so we basically went to meetings, did step work, and went fishing. After 8 months I started sponsoring other guys. The next 10 years were the best of my life. I stayed active and did things I only dreamed about. I eventually moved back to my home state and got involved in AA there as well.

Fast forward to late 2019 I tried phenibut. It was sold in convenience store energy shots so I thought nothing of it. I quickly became addicted. In early 2020 I took alprazolam that my dogs took for thunderstorms. Just .25mg and having an anxiety order I felt great. Within 3 months I was taking 30-40mg per day and wound up in detox in July for 9 days. I knew 9 days was a mistake at the time, knowing my brain needs 12-18 months to heal,  but went ahead anyway and went straight back to work. 

With meetings being impossible to find besides zoom I did very poorly mentally immediately. Even talking to my sponsor and program friends didn't quite understand.

Now I picked up alprazolam again 6 weeks ago. I got a bed in a minimum 90  day place (likely 6 months or more) ready for next week, have done the interviews, made arrangements with insurance, and paid $4k out of pocket, so I am going, but not until Wed. 

The scary part is that I've spent my entire career (43) now in my family business and some family members (9) total have decided it's time to cut ties. They will buy out my shares Monday and I will never be able to return. I work with my brother and dad everyday and love them dearly and will miss them horribly since I'm going out of state. I'm terrified because I've never had another job and this job has paid me more money than I ever imagined I'd make. It's just fear of the future. I have no degree. What the hell am i going to do with my life now once I'm stable in recovery again?

I don't plan to return to my current state since it kind of sucks and I'll never work in the business again. Just some encouraging words please. Fear is driving me mad tonight.

TLDR: fucked up, even more fucked up now and terrified.

Exactly 180 days ago I decided to JUMP! No taper. Nothing. Serious problems call for serious solutions. I jumped from 2mgs, which my doctor had me on for many, many years. I use to be on 4mgs but I came down a couple years prior. I also had a street benzo addiction. I was full fledged addicted and dependent. I had been for way too long.  But I gathered the strength to stop that day. It was the first big step I took to regaining control of my life. 

Anyways, here we are and I have no doubts that I am anything but 100% healed. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this good.  A very overlooked aspect of benzo and it's subsequent withdrawal is the absolute mind fuckery these pills do to you. That is very important to know if you've been on these long term or when jumping imo. 

Anyways, when you sober up you realize a lot of inconvenient truths. I made a huge mess out of my life. It's not going to be easy, but I know I can do what I need to. I wasn't living life but simply only existing. But its got much better in such a short time and it's going to continue to get better.

A little background on me, I've struggled with my own poly drug addictions for at least 7 years. One of the best things I ever did was to get a personal trainer/life coach to help redirect a lot of that addictive energy into fitness and exercise. This has had such an impact on my life that I decided to change careers and become a certified personal trainer myself so that I can help others.

So I have my own perspective and experience that has helped me, but I'm interested in getting the perspective of others in the recovery community. Would personal training be something that would interest you in your recovery? If so, is there anything in particular that you would look for? Workout plans, nutrition guidance, and goal setting are the bread and butter of personal training, but I want to know what else I could do to help.

First, let me say that anyone in this sub, posting or not, I'm really, really happy that you're in recovery or thinking about it. And I'm rooting for you all.

My partner started his recovery about 1.5 yrs ago from alcohol. He's quit many a thing, but this is the hardest battle he's had. It's gotten to the point where it's cost him his job now and pushed his liver close to the brink according to his GP. He's gone through severe withdrawal three times in the last year. At his worst, he was drinking a fifth a day. He's tapered down to two shots or so in the last months. He started seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, and taking medication about two months ago (you have no idea how proud and happy I was to see this happen, literally danced around).

He's hit his first bout of relapse (back to a fifth a day for the past two days), and I just...ugh. It sucks to see him back where he was at his worst, because he was starting to laugh like a normal person again.

Anyway, if you have any advice on how I can support him through this, would love to hear. Reading the stories hear of victories and slip ups makes me feel better. Beginning to realize that they're more realistic than just the one and done recovery stories.

Also, yes did try AlAnon and it didn't click for me. Will give it another go now that I'm in a better place.

Okay one more thing, a bit of a mini rant on the sheer volume and presence of alcohol commercials like ffs can we not just get a MINUTE",5

I do not have the urge to relapse or anything. The main reason I've managed to stay clean is because I cut all ties with that side of my life and moved 15 miles away. I literally disappeared; I was there one day and gone the next. I sort of left my so-called best mate in the shit when I disappeared. That shit has since been sorted out by my family (my saviours) in my absence but I now feel a really strong desire to let my ex friend know that I'm ok, I'm happy and I'm clean. I know they were probably really worried when I disappeared and I know that no one in my family has told anyone what happened to me so they have no way of knowing.

Why do I feel like I want to contact them? I would use my old Facebook (I've made a very private new one since moving) and would deactivate it afterwards. I don't want a reply from them and I definitely don't want to reconcile. Is it because I still care a little? Is it because I'm proud of what I've done, despite them being a shitty, enabling/scrounging friend.

Would it be a wise move? Would it give me closure? I just don't know. Has anyone been in the same situation? What did you do?

Extra info: I started casually on coke then quickly became addicted to crack for 10 months. Was a professional mum of 2 teenage boys. Hit a mid-life crisis or something.

I'm coming up on six months sober (knock wood), and I'm putting the cart a bit ahead of the horse, but I've been a little preoccupied about dating in the future. 

I plan to wait until the one year mark, but I hear people say that recovery has to come ahead of any relationship. That makes sense to me intuitively, but in practice, it seems like it would be hard to tell another person (at least a person who isn't in recovery) that he or she will never be the most important thing in my life and will always need to take a backseat to my recovery. 

My personal defects include a lot of insecurity, so perhaps I should instead work on understanding that I'm worth my sobriety and that if someone else can't understand that, I'm worth passing on that relationship - instead of assuming that it's going to bother a partner and be something that I can only hope they will grudgingly tolerate.

How has that gone for folks? Do partners who aren't in recovery seem to understand? Has it been an item of contention?",3

This is my thoughts dump but they have been stirring around inside me since I got 8 months ago. Some of us know what its like to be uncertain of what we did to our bodies and mind, amd although young, we must face consequences and our own mortality.

Alan Watts says death is like you go to sleep and never wake up or have no concept of living to compare it too and therefore is completely free of suffering. I believe it. But I am unsure how comfortable the moments leading up to death are. What happens to our conscious?

I (25F) am a recovering drug addict. I've been drug free (with a few slip ups) for the last two years after 7 years of drug abuse. Mostly weed, amphetamine and painkillers, but also a whole lot of psychedelics (probably around 150-200 trips). I drink once every or every other month, but not large amounts. I don't enjoy it that much anymore. 

It's not hard to stay away from drug, I barely even miss it. Of course at times I can miss being fucked up at a good rave or taking amphetamine by myself doing stuff I like, but mostly the thought of drugs just make me uncomfortable and disgusted. 
A couple of friends died and my best friend tried to end his life by diving through a window on the second floor after having a year long psychosis, which for me became the tipping point that made me decide to quit doing drugs and that whole lifestyle. I couldn't take being broken into pieces over and over again.

I quit hanging out with most of my friends and became secluded, just to get away from that enviroment and ever since I have had a hard time adjusting socially. 
I haven't got a lot of friends, barely any that lives in the same city as me. I've been working and really gotten along with my coworkers, but not been making friends with them outside work. 
Now I'm back in school to get my grades fixed, so I can apply to a university. I really like some of my class mates, but I can't seem to connect with them. 

I rarely tell anyone about my background. If anyone asks I will tell, but I don't spontaneously open up and it feels as if I'm a fraud. I don't feel like I belong. And often when I do tell, people don't understand, which I get, but I really long for that mutual understanding and recognizing of each others backgrounds. Or simply for me to be recognized. 

I was so molded during those years, it is such a big part of my identity. I feel so lonely, because most of the people I can relate to are still doing drugs. So for my own sake, I need to keep my distance. 

I just wan't to be open with people, because I like it when people know that part of me. But I don't know how to tell. 
And I don't know how to belong. I can rarely laugh together with my classmates, because most of them have such an untroubled sense of humor. 
And it's not like you can star a conversation with ""once when I did heroin at a train station.."" or something similar. It's not just the drugs through. With a bipolar father, I had a rough childhood. I've been through a lot of other trauma too: I was once kidnapped for three days while being beaten and extorted, I had an abusive coke-crazy boyfriend, my old best friend (who I introduced to heavy drugs) died in an overdose, a man at work had a heart attack and died in front of me at work last summer and also not to mention the great amount of bad trips I've endured that made my existential anxiety so much worse. 


I feel so lonely. I just want to connect. And by keeping my past to myself, I also keep a lot of the good stuff to myself, like my interest in music and dancing. I feel anonymous. Like a mirror, copying to fit in and by that lying about who I am. 

I'm in therapy and it's all right, it has helped me with coming to terms with some of my past trauma, but it is the social adjustment that is the big problem and I do not know what to do about it.

&#x200B;

I've become a bit worried about my cousin and his experimentations with drugs. My cousin and I (21 and 22 years old respectively) are very close, and we discuss all sorts of things, no matter how personal. And he enjoys talking about his experimentations with, and usage of, certain drugs. He sometimes does weed, almost exclusively with his friends, which I'm not really worried about; this doesn't happen often, perhaps once or twice per month. However, this past year he's been trying harder stuff, again with friends - he told me he tried MDMA and cocaine. I can't remember how many times he tried each, but iirc he's done cocaine at least twice. He also mentioned, almost bragged about, how he's more able now than before to get hold of drugs if he wanted to (the uncle of a friend of his deals drugs, and it's through him that my cousin was able to try MDMA). He said that he was only trying MDMA and cocaine for the sake of experimenting with his friends, to see what it's like and have fun.  


My cousin generally is a happy and very relaxed person, I've never seen him stressed out about anything. And his life seems to be in a good place; he got his own apartment this past summer, and a girlfriend. He has a good relationship with his closest friends and his family. I can't, however, avoid getting somewhat worried that he's slipping into a world of more active and frequent drug usage, and that he will want to try very heavy stuff. He has had mild depressive episodes before, so he's not exactly immune to sadness and depression. I've told him he should be cautious, and to watch out for any signs of him becoming addicted. We've talked about addiction several times, and how easily anyone can become addicted. I don't want it to happen to my cousin, he's like the little brother I never had. I care about him. 

&#x200B;

So, with the risk of sounding stupid, can you see any warning signs in my cousin's drug usages, and the way he talks about it? And what were your experience of becoming addicted? Do you know why and how it happened? How did you perceive yourselves and the risk of becoming addicted? I'd love to hear your stories and inputs. Thanks in advance.",2

I‚Äôve learned so much from all of you and I‚Äôm doing al anon meetings. I feel I‚Äôm in my own recovery... and trying not to question to much but today was a day... My behaviour towards my boyfriend who‚Äôs now 30 days clean from coke has changed. I can‚Äôt take him anymore... 

To be honest I‚Äôm starting to feel like he‚Äôs a lost cause. He said that at the rehab center that he‚Äôs at that people are sneaking drugs in, (their friends are leaving drugs by a fence), and that he‚Äôs not getting therapy and wants to leave. They also cancelled a bunch of workshops and speakers that they were supposed to have because of covid.

Now I‚Äôm questioning if all of this is true or not. I think the canceling of activities is, but the rest, idk. 

Also, 2 weeks into being there I did feel like he may have done coke while there... but I can‚Äôt be sure, obviously. It‚Äôs just that his voice on the phone was weird and he told me he was playing a video game on his phone that he used to play when high as fuck, and then we were talking more and he forgot what day it was. That also could have just been his brain rewiring itself. Idk. I could be paranoid as well. No idea.

Today I was supposed to send him a letter and ask him for space over the next 2 months while he completes treatment but when we got on the phone he just rambled on and on for an hour about how shitty the place was and about how it was a waste of money ($2,500 a month), and that he could be sitting at his Mom‚Äôs house (he knows I won‚Äôt let him move back in here yet) and getting tons of therapy for that cost. He has a point, but he will need more therapy after rehab anyways in my opinion. He has childhood trauma that he will need to work though. He also told me today his counsellor totally thought that it was fine if he didn‚Äôt give up smoking weed. WTF? 

Am I with the biggest liar ever or what? Isn‚Äôt rehab supposed to be like a brotherhood? Why would you want to leave? If drugs really are being snuck in, are you able to stay away from it? What‚Äôs the actual issue is what I‚Äôm wondering. 

He says he wants to come out and do an outpatient treatment. He already did the research, but I think he doesn‚Äôt realize that everything is on zoom... everything is closed. So he wants to leave rehab to sit on his Mom‚Äôs couch? 

He also said he has absolutely no coke cravings... well I find that hard to believe since he‚Äôs been using for over ten years... on and off, but near the end of his ‚Äúbottom‚Äù he was pawning stolen items for money for coke. 30 days later he has no cravings whatsoever?

Please talk some sense into me, lol. Btw, I was super clam today and told him that he knows his body best, and encouraged him not to make a rash decision. He said he wouldn‚Äôt and that he always want to be honest with me (hope he means it). I appreciate that. But... I must say I‚Äôm very disappointed. I‚Äôm trying to understand what might be going through his head, but I‚Äôve never been to rehab. Thanks! 

P.s. I‚Äôm still prepared to give him the letter I wrote, but timing didn‚Äôt seem right today. I will eventually need a lot of space and time away from him to heal and he will need to earn his trust back.",3

I feel bad sometimes when I go to a meeting and hear what other people have been through when I don't have any comparable stories of my own. It's easy to understand why someone would turn to alcohol after some kind of traumatic upbringing or event; it is less easy for me to rationalize my own journey, as my use doesn't seem justified for similar reasons. I had a lot going for me before I started abusing substances. It just seems that I went out of my way to ruin what easily could have been a nice life with good opportunities, and I deal with a lot of guilt around this.

A conversation I recently had with a fellow addict also had me thinking whether the 2/3 figure is actually a conservative estimate. He just said something along the lines of, ""well obviously we have all had our own childhood trauma."" For whatever reason, I felt the need to correct him, and he said that this would make me part of a very small minority. When I was in rehab, we learned that addiction is a physical disease of the brain that has a large genetic component - my understanding was that we could very well be born this way, with our neuropathways already miswired. The possibility that I could have been born with this problem has helped me deal with the guilt around ending up this way in spite of having a positive upbringing, supportive family, etc., and I feel like the idea that it has to stem from trauma basically invalidates this. I guess I just wanted to share these thoughts, and maybe feel out if it indeed is as rare as I've been told or if any others here have similar feelings toward their trauma-free experiences.",21

Hi Matt,

Because of how much I love you this is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I really was the happiest I've ever been in my life when I met you, but because of all the things that happened between us, I question everything. Because of how much I love you, I am in so much pain. I am in more pain than I've ever been in my entire life. I lost myself trying to fix you. I stopped loving myself. My whole life was about you, and also wanting to feel loved by you again. I got caught up trying to make sense of everything, and like you said, comparing myself to people I should not have been comparing myself to. As I told you before I lost my self-esteem, my self-worth, and as I try to get it back, I still find myself constantly questioning myself, doubting myself, you and our future. I know I can no longer bring up the past, but I still do not feel closure, and I know that this is unhealthy for us if we are to be in a relationship. 

I don't know if you'll ever be able to bring me that closure. I don't know if you‚Äôll ever be able to prove to me that you are who you say you are. I would love to believe and trust that you are no longer in contact with your ex-girlfriend. But unfortunately, I don't. I would need to feel more secure in our relationship in order for us to move forward. I let so many things slide. I let you break down my walls, my boundaries just so I could feel wanted and loved again. The sick and sad part is that I don't even know if when I did that if I was receiving true love or not. I don't know how you could prove to me or show me that it is true love. I don't know if perhaps you'd be able to show me look, my ex, she's reaching out to me, but I'm not replying. It doesn't bring me comfort to just tell me she has not reached out. Knowing her, she would have tried in many ways. I would feel more comfortable knowing she tried seeing desperation in messages that would only be sent by someone that wasn't receiving a reply... or why not finally get the do not contact letter made up? Either way, these aren't things that you should be thinking about during rehab, but they would have helped or may help us in the future. Your sobriety comes first. It is the most important thing in your world right now, and because of how broken I am at this moment I also know that I can no longer offer any type of emotional support. I love you, so I wish things were different. I would love to be there for you. But I need to fix myself. If we are to have a relationship in the future, I need reassurance, security, proof, closure, communication, healthy communication... I need to feel like I can ask to see your phone and not be told that I owe you an apology for that. I need to get to a point where I don't have doubts, don't question anything... And you should be helping me get there... All of this was your doing. You play a huge part in rebuilding trust. But, right now, you‚Äôre in rehab. Our relationship is secondary. 

I know that this is going to be one of the hardest fights of your life, but at your age and for what you have to lose, it is so important you fight as hard as you possibly can. If you're truly an addict, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to smoke weed again. At least not for the next 5-10 years.

For what it's worth, and if you are questioning our future, may I please remind you that I want a warrior. I want a fighter. I want a man who‚Äôs proud to hand me their phone, who loves me unconditionally, proudly posts my pictures all over social media, so everyone knows to stay the fuck away because he loves his girl, and proudly turns another girl down. After all this shitty pain that I've been through I can't accept anything less from anyone ever again. I hate what I've been through. I hate this pain, but I'm going to use this pain in a way that serves a purpose in my life. This pain will always be a reminder of what I will not accept. It‚Äôs my wake-up call for what I deserve. I will never lose my self-worth again. I know that I will trust again. I know that my heart will be open again, and I will fucking make sure it's for the right person, and I also know that the right person won't ever stop fighting for me. I know that the right person won't ever let anything ever get in our way and will do anything to show me that. They won‚Äôt tell me what I want to hear. They will show me. I also know that that person will never put me down or call me names and will have utmost respect for me. If I don't see this person in you when you're out of rehab, that's okay, but I encourage you to be that person for the right person in your life. I feel that you have every opportunity to have everything you've ever wanted. I encourage you to work on yourself. If we have any chance at a true relationship, and the one that we both said we wanted, I know that I need to get better. Either way, I need to get better, and I firmly believe that you do to.

I believe in you, Matt. I always have. I don't believe that you're this horrible person, but you've been horrible. And I also believe that you are one drink or drug away from living that horrible life again. Trust in what I just said. Work the program. Surrender yourself. Life will reward you. And I also believe that the best support you can receive right now are from other addicts and ex-addicts. Not from me, not from your Mom. As far as us, I really just want to leave it at this: if I am your life partner, once you‚Äôre healed, I know you'll do whatever it takes.",6

The night I came back he overdosed again and EMTs were called/cpr/multiple narcans with help from his roommate. I am debating on whether to tell his parents and get them involved. I cannot do this alone. I feel so alone and helpless and I need more support but he feels so guilty burdening his parents with his addiction. They have been through a lot with him over the past ten years. Should I get them involved? I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Recovering addicts, have you been in this position? Has anyone gotten your family involved behind your back? Do you resent them still? help please...

Edit: this is probably relevant- he is 28 and I‚Äôm 26. He owns his own house and does not rely on his parents so I think that may be contributing to him feeling like they don‚Äôt need to be so involved.

This is the first time I've ever taken my sobriety as seriously as I should. I've been to rehab 5 or 6 times, but ironically the times I've had any substantial length of clean time was when I had to do 8-12 month court ordered programs through Drug and Alcohol, which is a county funded treatment organization/facility. Twice I've done Prop 36 where I successfully completed everything with relative ease, although now I'm doing sobriety completely on my own without being forced by the law and it feels pretty good to have more self control than I've had in the past. I think I just care more about myself and others now.  


Anyhow, over the past 60 days it definitely hasn't been easy at times, although I think that's the way life tends to be whether you're sober or not. I'm slowly gaining back the trust of my girlfriend (she will be my wife in the next couple years, hopefully) as well as my grandparents, who are the ones that raised me from the age of 7. I have a small family and only really have 2 people in which I would trust with my life, that being my future wife and my grandmother. My family, like a lot of people say, is pretty fucked up. My mother is mentally ill and my dad left when I wasn't even a year old. I won't go too far down that road because that isn't quite the correct sub for that, but nevertheless it plays into the reasons why I decided to do hard drugs in my mid to late teens. Fast forward 10 years and here I am sitting in my room at my grandparents house in the COVID era, soon to gain back the privilege of driving and ultimately the absolute trust of my family to know that I won't just go down to the dealers house and get a sack. I am going back to making payments on my car in under 2 weeks and this is a huge step in my recovery. I've gone though this cycle, like I said earlier, maybe 5 times with driving and each time it becomes a bigger and bigger deal. I seem to have more and more to lose with each time I get my car back. I'm not on probation either with makes it better and worse depending how you look at it. At the end of the day, I'm slowly but surely getting my life back on track and it feels really good, but also gives me doses of anxiety here and there. I try to remind myself that it's healthy to feel just a tad bit nervous, that it means I truly care about my sobriety and those that care about me as well. 2021 is going to be a good year for me and that's what I feel in my heart.   


This may have been longer than I wanted but I don't care, I really needed to share this with you guys because I missed my home meeting today and I have other obligations to tend to tonight, so no meeting until tomorrow. I really hope this helped somebody out there tonight. Randomly I came upon this sub a couple months ago and since then it's really helped me in some ways. To everyone out there, I urge you to share your experience here because you will not regret it. Only good can come out of it. With that being said, I hope you all stay safe and have fun with your Christmas presents. :\^) Love you all.",11

Am I safe to take naltrexone in the morning? Or am I not understanding how it works? Everything I can find only says that an opioid dependent person needs to wait until acute withdrawal is over so the opioid/dopamine receptors upregulate/sensitize, but shouldn't my brain not have had the time to downregulate/desensitize? It was only one time, and not a ton, so surely my brain is essentially the same as yesterday. Therefore, shouldn't I be good for tomorrow? 

I really appreciate any advice or anecdotal evidence. I'll probably nibble on a sand-grain-sized piece either way, just to be safe. God forbid I get blasted in the face by the full 50mg of naltrexone and it turns out I'm wrong.",2

Yesterday was 21 days sober, not my first time. I'm swimming, kayaking, painting and going camping next week. Life is good, depression is fading but craving still haunts me. What do do sober when you're exhausted from all the exercise, I have more time and money. 

Thankyou to everyone who has posted their own stories, it helps to know of  your strength and will.

A good friend of mine passed away from this horrible disease. He had many sober years it just took one time of too many beers and drugs.  But what is bothering is his best friend is really hurting. I feel like I should message her. But I am at a loss for words. Just so many emotions and saddness. What should I do? Any advice would help. Thanks,3
2021-01-01 22:50:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/koq5uy/the_momsized_hole/,The mom-sized hole,"I heard the term a mom sized hole. And I felt that. All of my life I have been drinking and searching to find the person or thing to fill my mom and dad sized hole in my heart. It wasn‚Äôt the stress or the perfectionism. I was trying to fill the hole. The pain I felt from not being accepted and loved in my family killed me. I chased that acceptance and love from everyone else in my life. And alcohol was there to soothe me when I couldn't  find it. And now that it is gone, I‚Äôm having to face the hole that was left. And I‚Äôm doing that on my own. There is no one in my life to fill that hole, only me. I have to be enough. My love has to be enough to comfort me at night. To comfort me when I‚Äôm upset. Whoever comes in my life next needs to add to that journey to love myself. For the first time on August 11th, I chose to take care of myself because alcohol lied. It was causing more pain, not relieving it. And I had to learn how to feel all the pain without alcohol numbing it and making it better. Because, in the end, the pain was still there and it had festered. I read once that alcohol only postpones the anxiety. When it‚Äôs gone, my brain had made the anxiety even worse and my hole I was in was deeper. In July, I was losing my soul to the alcohol. 

For the first time in my life, I don‚Äôt have to leave the house to feel better and getting ready to leave the house is a pain. Whereas before, I was always at the bar by 2:00 on days like today because I couldn't be alone. The hole was too big. I still find myself wanting to escape and feel a little less. On Christmas Day, I grieved what my family never was and what they would never be to me. The tears started at 1:00 and didn‚Äôt end till 7:00. A few days later, my relationship with Sean ended for good, and the old feelings of abandonment came rushing in. My counselor reminded me that the abandonment had happened before the relationship ended. This pain was not new. The actual state of the relationship was catching up to the reality of what it had been. 

The pain has to be felt. And the tears have to be cried. Years of tears has been the way I‚Äôve described it. I am going to fill the hole that my family created, the mom and dad sized hole. It‚Äôs going to be slow and sometimes it‚Äôs going to hurt. But, it‚Äôs a start. What hole are you trying to fill with alcohol? It won‚Äôt fill it. You‚Äôll have to. Bring people in who will help you fill that hole. But. It will be you. And you can do it.",22
2021-01-01 22:26:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/koprwr/eight_years/,Eight years.,"Eight years ago today I made the hardest decision of my life. I said goodbye to one of my best friends, to my shield, to my constant companion. It wasn't easy. But eight years later, I still don't regret it. Not even a little, not even at all. 

If today is the day you make the same decision I once did, I'm proud of you, and I wish you luck. If today is just another day on your recovery journey, I'm proud of you, and I wish you luck. 

Thanks, and see you next year.",20
2021-01-01 16:32:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/kojler/day_1/,Day 1,"Hello, I have been alcohol and cocaine free since Sept 2009. Jumped into AA and was involved for about a year and half before life became busy and I just did the bare minimum. 

I would go to maybe two meetings a week and somehow stayed sober or more like clean until March 2020. Having to work from home took me out of my meeting routine and I stopped going all together. I really have not been doing anything to treat my alcoholism/drug addiction for years and I am surprised stayed clean as long as I did. I started taking hydrocodone in March, it was prescribed to me 6 months prior for shoulder pain, but I started taking more for the brief high. By August I was smoking weed every day. 

This past Monday I woke up and decided enough was enough and started praying and began reading the Big Book. Went to a lunch meeting Tuesday and picked a white chip. Yesterday I was stressed out and went right back to weed and hydrocodone, it was easy convince myself I will start over tomorrow being a New Year and all.

One question I have is I have been relapsing on outside substances but I am definitely alcoholic. I know AA has a singleness of purpose and I am not sure if I should share about weed and such in an AA meeting.

Thanks",10

No awful hangover, no withdrawal, no dreadful need to seek out a substance. I shared about a week ago how I hit my 90 days. Well I decided to go public on Facebook and tell everybody everything. The alcohol, the drugs, the pancreatitis, everything. It was very unnerving showing the world who I really am but I also felt a huge weight come off my shoulders. My hope was that I could help at least one person. I've been to many detoxes, behavioral health institutions and rehabs. I've met a lot of great people along the way and some of them I am Facebook friends with. Well this one guy I knew from my last detox saw my post and he decided to give sobriety another shot! He also woke up today sober. I really think I got the courage from groups like this. So thank you everyone! Enjoy you're day!",16

The holidays were prime time for me when I used... lots of free time and usually some extra disposable income. The thoughts of using were still there but no real cravings. My dad did not try to get me to drink during xmas dinner, and with NYE one of my best mates got some alcohol free beers in for me to have and did not call his dealer. Told him that if he wanted to it was fine but I would leave probably pretty abruptly. We were at his house so his rules, but he went along with it. So things have been going well. Better than expected even. Can‚Äôt wait to pick up my 60 day chip!",9
2021-01-01 10:12:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/kocrqy/7_days_sober/,7 Days Sober,"I have been aware I am an alcoholic for about a year and a half and have tried to quit several times. I thought just knowing was enough, but always ended up at the store buying more. Over Christmas I visited someone that was married to my dad that I have been in and out of touch over the last decade. I remember once when I was young my stepmom took me to an AA meeting, but looking back she was the strongest, smartest (fill in the blank of everything you admire about a person) I knew, but AA just never felt right for me, I am an atheist and viewed it as just replacing one habit with another and did not want to be the AA GUY.  

I have tried to come clean with friends and family about my struggle and even asked to let me commit to them I was going to stay sober with daily updates. When I told my friends/family they were very kind, they reacted how I would to something I don‚Äôt fully comprehend, quiet and comforting as best as they could. But I still ended up back at the store buying liquor eventually.

I have had increasing stomach issues that I am sure is related to the drinking, but I kept drinking on top of the pain, one day coming to the full realization this was going to kill me. I continued the game of I will have a couple drinks here and there but I am really quitting, just slowly and surely. But I always landed back at my peak of a half a bottle a night. 

Subconsciously I was aware I was in a losing battle, but I don‚Äôt think reality have checked me yet. This last Christmas have an opportunity to see my stepmom in a long time, I felt compelled to reach out to her because nobody seem to really understand what I was going through. All I said was ‚ÄúI was wanting to talk to you about my drinking problem‚Äù, and unlike my friends and family prior, she wasn‚Äôt quiet she was bold and gave me a long and awkward hug, as uncomfortable as I was at the moment as family was looking at us, I also silly felt more comfort than I have ever hand in my alcoholic struggles. She immediately took me outside so we could talk alone, and started off very jovial by asking what my favorite drink was, once I told her she immediately responded that she also loved it and I could just see her almost salivating at the idea of drinking. I had never seen this side of her before, I was feeling so many things at the moment that finally someone understands, somebody that I greatly admire has gone through the same struggle, But they I have always seem so put together that I could not comprehend them being as pathetic as I felt I was. This last week has been so overwhelming, but in the most euphoric way. She is giving me all kinds of insight of where the struggle comes, and that it‚Äôs OK two except your powerlessness against it, which I never even thought would be the approach. For anybody out there that is trying to do it alone, if you find yourself back at the store buying more liquor, I know for me it is already had a huge impact talking to someone who really understands, a veteran of alcoholism if you will. I am only on my first week of this new recovery, but I feel stronger than I have ever before, I feel like every failure in my life can be rectified to some extent, and I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how foreign those feelings are to me. I want to share this, in hopes of someone else going through something similar and also as a reminder to how I feel at this moment",51
