I used to drink due to loneliness, body issues and past trauma (I‚Äôm sure you relate...) 
My drink of choice was vodka water and weekends meant I was on a liquid diet mostly  I was very skinny. 
My skin was horrible, my mind was worse and my work life suffered tremendously. 

Getting sober has been one of the best decisions and daily decisions I‚Äôve made. But lately I have been so stressed from work I have been using food in the same way. It worries me because although I try to rebel against what society has taught me about looks and standards it‚Äôs so deeply ingrained it feels almost impossible when I‚Äôm being honest with myself. 
My clothes don‚Äôt fit anymore, I don‚Äôt feel sexy and I‚Äôm alone most of the time. Which for the most part of this year hasn‚Äôt been a problem. 
But my ex is back in town and reached out to me, only to then ignore me, I had a triggering fight with a relative, and my work is exploiting my time and work ethic. 
I‚Äôm trying to look to tomorrow and strengthen my strategies. I am very scared of going to a gym but I guess I will have to. 
I‚Äôm not looking for advice but more stories of relation - or affirmation, stories of regrettable relapse, even. I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone to speak to about this right now. So hopefully one of you feels a resonance with this. 

I don‚Äôt want to drink but I can see the warning signs of my thought patterns and the way I am using food in the same way. 
I even considered buying drugs for tonight but have thankfully come to my senses and decided to have a night in. I have made breakfast plans for the morning instead of plans of debauchery for the evening. The intrusive thoughts of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù keep surfacing.

I wanna share a short story with you about me + mdma, and I would like to ask for your advice.

I got to try mdma/ecstasy last May at a small - legal - party with a friend and it felt like nothing I've ever dreamt of, I had so much fun and got more social and the whole experience, but that was it I didn't really crave it afterwards, I remember feeling so happy for days or weeks afterwards.

date: 1.12.2020

I had to change my weed dealer so I got connected to another dealer who sells pills too, I asked about xtc and he said he has 300mg pills, I bought 20 and thought I would give 15 to my friends and 5 for me and thought these 5 would last me till end of 2021, I took one the same night to remind myself of what it is like to be high on mdma, and I basically did the same thing every night

date: 20.12.2020

I'm calling the dealer again because I ran out of pills, I got 20 more and thought this time I only do it on weekends with friends or at parties, I did it with or without friends everyday, I don't even feel high anymore, I just consume it to make me feel normal and it doesn't even do that anymore, I feel like I don't remember who am I, and today 31.12.2020 I realized I only have 5 left

since 4 days,

I can't sleep well, and I'm having really bad morning that makes me wish I never wake up again

I'm always tired, just walking makes me feel exhausted I feel like I'm losing control here

I remebered being in bars I didn't know, with a man I didn't know and just that horrible feeling of shame and remorse. 

As I laid thinking about it stronger memories started coming back to me. I remembered snuggling with my puppy on the sofa in the early evening and going to bed early with a book. Did I drink the night before? No, I was certain that I did not. Relief flooded through me. I get to keep my days and I get to keep my sobriety. 

In a way I'm happy about these dreams because they give me little reminders of what would happen if I drink. Quite often now I refuse alcohol in my dreams.

I must say, I‚Äôve been struggling very badly this last week. My DOC is always just a couple minutes from wherever I am. I pass it in the store, see it on Uber eats, see it on commercials, sit at the table with friends who are ingesting it, etc. 

I submitted an order for three bottles of wine the other night, but I cancelled it before my courier had been assigned. Didn‚Äôt know what I was thinking. 7 months took so much effort, but gets immediately tossed away by one impulsive decision. Glad I resurfaced.

But sometimes I realize just how truly boring life is without alcohol. I‚Äôm so bored, despite being surrounded by things to do. I used to think that even if I died young, at least I was having fun at the end of my road.

So, in my sobriety, the easy part for me was stopping drinking. I only crave drinking when I am encountering a situation I have never done sober for the first time and my first thought is to drink. My second thought is it will fuck up my anxiety if I drink.(Sober Powered Episode 22). So I don‚Äôt drink. Then I enter the pain that would lead me to drink in those situations. On Christmas day, the grief and the pain was overwhelming. The tears started at 1:30 and didn‚Äôt stop till 7. At 5:30, my friend suggested I write. Writing this blog has been such a huge part of my recovery, why hadn‚Äôt I thought of that sooner. I wrote a letter to my parents. A letter I am never going to send because that is not where my healing will happen. I will never get the apology or acknowledgement I need.

Instead - I saw the choices I made from trauma and forgave myself. My two marriages were trauma choices and yet I am still the mother of two amazing beautiful children. Sean was my first relationship that was not a trauma choice, and it was the space in which I finally began to heal. I have not made the same trauma choices I usually make in my breakup. By now, I would have already hooked up with at least one person to heal the loneliness. And, I have not. That is HUGE! I saw myself achieve in spite of the trauma. I have created boundaries in the last year to protect my family and my children. And now they are flourishing.

My word for 2020 (the new big thing in recovery in the last few days) is bloom. My friend sent me a calendar page of that word: Bloom: to come into or be in full beauty and health; flourish; become radiant and glowing. Goal: Bloom where you are. Know that everything you need is right inside of you - your strength and ability to grow. Nourish your body and take care of your mind. I am working on nourishing my body part as my appetite has not come back since I have been sober. My first step of 2021.

If trauma or unheard feelings is part of your recovery, I recommend writing that letter that you‚Äôre never going to send. There is so much healing in putting your truth out there. No one has even read my letter yet, and I already have so much compassion and grace for the woman I was. So much appreciation for the growth I have made in the last 4 and ¬Ω months. And, I survived six hours of crying on Christmas and cried years of tears. Use this week as you head into the new year writing that letter and sharing your truth, forgiving the person you were at the time who was doing the best they could. Surround yourself with love. You deserve it. I know I have had so much healing by going through the pain. There is so much resentment that was released when I wrote that letter on Christmas. I didn‚Äôt hold back. I wrote everything that I know would upset them if I said out loud. I said my truth. I was a goddamn Cheetah.",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.438591}"

Towards high school and college, she had gotten her life together, was clean for years and had a stable job as well. I am now in the Military and away from home, so this has been hard to deal with.


Recently, she has spiraled worse than ever before and has lost custody of my younger sibling in the process. She called me recently begging for money for food and gas, and also that she didn't want to withdrawal. I said no, I do not want to buy your drugs for you, however I can order food and get you ubers to where you need to go. She promptly refused so clearly food and gas was not the issue. 


This was the first time she asked me personally for money because my grandfather, bless his heart is an enabler. He gives her money whenever she asks because he is afraid she will end up on the street.  


She refuses to do inpatient rehab, because she says she wants to get a pain management doctor, and get prescribed methadone while she does outpatient. This seems like an excuse to me, because she has said the same thing for months, and never has been to an appointment with a pain management doctor.


She clearly doesn't want to get clean because she sees drugs as the only reprieve from her pain (that may be caused by withdrawals anyways). 


So what do I do? I don't want her to be another statistic and I do not want my sibling to grown up without a mother. She has already hit rock bottom as she lost her job, her home, and her child, so i'm not sure what can motivate her besides getting that back.

Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from Methadone, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I‚Äôve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by ‚Äúlove‚Äù or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.
There is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It‚Äôs been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn‚Äôt comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I‚Äôve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.

There is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection.

I was very isolated, not working a program, and over-run by self will, disappointment and resentment. And fear.

I was never much of a drinker. I was always a drug person. I thought drinking wouldnt be so bad. 

I went from a half pint, to a pint, to a 5th, to a gallon a night within a couple weeks.

in that time I think i broke some toes. I woke up in the hospital once, too. Apparently my smoke alarm went off and my landlord had to come in because i wasnt answering the door. She found me passed out with all the burners on my stove on. No food. Just empty pots.

My neighbors saw the whole thing. I endangered them.

She called an ambulance because I was unresponsive. I did come to long enough to cuss them out.

I had to walk back from the hospital across the city at 1am in my pajamas.

There was one night in which i drank so much that my hands shook so bad the next couple days I could not raise a fork to my mouth and consequently couldn't eat or walk for two days.

Ive decided to move back home into my parents house.

I descovered one of my neighbors, a friend from highschool, is also in recovery and there are meetings every night here.

Ive been going every night for the past week.

I feel so much better. I have hope again.",63,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44858205}"

As the title says, I am at work and it is my boss‚Äôs birthday. She is an amazing woman and practically a second mother to me. My boss is aware that I am a recovering addict and is a positive influence on me. She handed out a slice of cake to everyone and opened a bottle of wine. She asked me if I wanted a glass, I then paused and hesitated on declining. She realized then what had happened and apologized but I said it was no big deal and went back to work. 

I know her intentions were not bad, as it was just a nice gesture to offer. But I‚Äôm more concerned that it took me a moment to decline. I normally don‚Äôt hesitate as I‚Äôm around alcohol often due to having family and friends that drink. In that brief moment I thought about all the good times I had drinking wine with friends and past partners. I also thought about how my life spiraled out of control from a single drink. 

I just thought of this moment as a test and a wake up call that I am not over my disease. No matter how many times I tell myself that I can overcome it, it is just pure arrogance and lying to myself. I look forward to tomorrow, day 667. Thank you for letting me share.",105,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.62432086}"

Things have not been great, recovery-wise. I have been stalling any personal growth and have been kicking hard at that doorstop keeping my alcoholism from slamming into me. Doorstop was somewhat solid, but if I keep kicking it, it will come lose.

And what's more than me kicking that thing, the alcoholism being held back by it is a serious mf that can't shut up for a day straight. ""I won't jump you if you take off the doorstop"" it says. ""Not this time. I mean, listen to yourself if you won't listen to me. You don't even want to drink.""

True. I don't want to drink. Yet. I just want to be left alone, and to cut all contact to people that have saved my life, quite literally. Stop applying principles I have come to embrace.  I don't want to keep doing daily things I have done for almost 3 years now and that keep the doorstep solid.

It's always ""different this time"", right? After so many years of relapses, hospitals, and crap, I know for a fact that ""doing it alone"" does NOT work for me. Couple weeks will probably feel like freedom. Then I will feel restless. Then I will drink. It's almost like physical law.

So you see, the rationalizing is in full swing. All it takes is a text or call to someone saying I am out. Heck, I don't even need that, but it's apparently part of my M.O.

Knowing all this, why not just firmly push the doorstop back in place and go about life?

I'm not sure anymore what I signed up for anymore. I did not exactly choose to be alive, I was just pushed out of a hospital bed and into life. A life in which I can FUNCTION. I can work. I can get through the day. I always have food and a roof over my head. Talk about ungrateful. My life is bland, dull, and painfully messed up when it comes to mental health and emotions. I know these are excuses.

I just can't keep on FUNCTIONING like a robot, feeling like I am made of glass when people talk to me, finding it at times difficult to tie my fucking shoes. I did not sign up for this? Or maybe I did. I just don't think I can do it anymore. And the big guy upstairs? Is awfully quiet. This is not a relationship to a power greater than me, this is a fucking *marriage*. I get *nothin*.

My BF is on a binge and I don't feel safe here.,"I am newly in recovery. My boyfriend has had his own issues, in and out of rehab several times, after which he has been a binge drinker. Since I got sober he has only brought home a 6 pack of beer twice (that I know of) and both times I followed my sponsors advice and just kept my distance and let him do him.

His behavior and attitude has been unusual the past few days, I thought it was because his 13 year old son was here for the holidays. He's been staying up all night, sleeping all day and been grumpy and picking petty arguments over everything, where no amount of apology will end it.

Its 5am, I just got up to pee and he just went on a 45 minute rant about how I ruined his life by having him goto rehab 2 years ago.
 Anyway I went into the bathroom can came across 3 of the 1.75L bottles of bourbon. One empty, 2 still full.

Not only is he miserable to be around when he's drinking, but I'm new in sobriety and have no desire to be around either him OR the bourbon. He particularly nasty when drinking liquor, and I haven't seen that from him in about 8 months. 

That being said, his problem is his own, I have to leave it to him and his HP and this post isn't really about him. Its about MY sobriety and I am not comfortable in this situation.

 My roommate and good friend rents our basement and she's away for the next week. I want to go stay there. My own son is out of state visiting his grandparents, but if the BF keeps drinking like this I don't want him around my son. I am so overwhelmed and upset and its too early to call anyone. I'm not engaging with him, I know he won't be coming to bed but when I wake up I need to get away from this.

Ready for a story? This‚Äôll be a long one! Lmao! 

Ok so I (39m) and my ex (26f) have this weird relationship thing going on right now and I was looking for opinions/suggestions/input. I know I probably won‚Äôt like most‚Äî if not all‚Äî of them. lmao. Ok so here it goes. But you‚Äôll need to know the back story. You‚Äôll need to know where we started and all the trials and tribulations that went into whatever it is we have‚Äî at least a shortened version of some of them at least. 

First tho, I should give a trigger warning as we‚Äôre both in recovery right now and there will be talk of past drug/alcohol use. I‚Äôm addict/alcoholic and she‚Äôs an addict. There‚Äôs also going to be talk of cutting, suicide, and eating disorders. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more triggers in here as well. Soooo back to story time. 

We met back in February of this year (2020) maybe around 5pm or so‚Äî idk w/e. We hit it off pretty great as friends and there was definitely a spark there. I met her over my buddy‚Äôs house, and gave her my number in case she wanted to talk more some day‚Äî literally 5 minutes after I left she was blowing me up. We talked all that day/night up until she got a call abt her aunt in the hospital dying around 4am. She of course immediately went to the hospital to meet with her mother and spend what little time she had left with her aunt. The next morning she borrowed her mother‚Äôs car and left the hospital to get fresh clothes for her and her mother and got pulled over. Now this is the part where I tell you she had a warrant and got arrested for a probation violation (OD‚Äôd) and was immediately jailed. Our story would‚Äôve ended there because at that point we had only known each other for about 12-15 hrs and she didn‚Äôt know my number by heart. We barely knew each other. 

But it didn‚Äôt end there. Oh no. Not at all. lol. That next day I was over some friends house. I, of course, was talking all abt this amazing woman I had met the day before and how I just felt something different‚Äî yet something just familiar. It was a feeling I haven‚Äôt felt before. And I have known love before. My fianc√©e and I had broken up abt 8months prior after being together for almost 14 yrs (story for another time), but w/ this woman it was just different. Idk. Anyway, I was just gassing her up to my friends and we hear a knock on the door. My friend goes to answer the door and it‚Äôs the police. Apparently she had a warrant out for her arrest. So my friend, of course, gets arrested. Now unbeknownst to me (or my friends) at the time the girl I had met the day before had been incarcerated. I figured she was just busy with the dying aunt. 

So my friend calls me later that night after processing to talk to her boyfriend and try to figure out arrangements to bail her out. And right before I pass the phone off to him my friend asks me the name of the girl I had been talking abt. Well, I‚Äôm sure you can guess the rest. As fate would have it, it was indeed the same girl. So my friend was able to give this girl my number and she called. And we talked. And we talked. And we talked and talked and talked. And we wrote letters to each other back and forth daily. And when I say wrote letters I mean that. Our letters would be a minimal of 10 pages front and back‚Äî my longest was around 23 pages front and back. (She loved them piss yellow legal pad pages I wrote to her lol). We got to know each other rather well, and after about a month she asked me if I would commit to her‚Äî if I would be her boyfriend. Well, it was a little more cute than that, but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. So there I was dating a con. A love story for the ages. lmao. Anyway, things continued pretty well. She ended up being locked up for about a month and a half and was released early due to coronavirus. She was out for 4-5 days before she checked into 30 day stay. And we spent just abt every waking hour together. She was sober, I sadly was not, and we were happy. She checked into inpatient and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs when the cracks started. Nothing major, but our communication was severely cut. Phone calls were more limited in rehab, but we still talked almost daily. Since she was only allowed one call per day she had to divide that between her mother and i, but we still wrote daily for the first couple weeks until her counselors started giving her shit abt not putting as much effort into the program that they would‚Äôve liked to have seen. They advised her to start journaling and writing me less‚Äî even though our letters were pretty therapeutic for her. Anyway, our communication decreased‚Äî instead of being on the phone for hours a day we went down to 5 minutes most days as that was the max clients were allowed to use the phone. Instead of murdering trees by the hundreds we wrote a few pages here and there. On a side note, I wondered for a time if her counselors had not limited our communication if things would‚Äôve been different?

Anyway, 30 days came and went. Her mom and I had formed a pretty decent relationship during that time. Her mother was pretty skeptical of me at the beginning‚Äî since, well, this girl hadn‚Äôt the best track record in her previous relationships‚Äî on top of the fact her mother thought the worst of me drug wise. Yea, I am an addict/alcoholic now in recovery‚Äîand so is she‚Äî but our DoCs were different. I‚Äôm not saying mine were worse or better either. An addict is an addict is an addict. So her mom naturally thought my DoC was the same as her daughters. She was relieved to find out it wasn‚Äôt and thats I think where the trust started forming. 

So 30 days later we were finally reunited again. And it was great. She had jail/rehab behind her and we were moving forward. We had plans and we were happy. And that lasted for about a solid 2 months. I could feel it. I rly could. I felt her slipping away and isolating. I starting noticing the deception and lies forming. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. She was testing me. Prodding me into a corner to try and make arguments, and I tried my damndest not to fall for it. This culminated until we hit our boiling point. She started disappearing for hours/days. And we finally had our first argument. And then another. And then the truth finally came out. She was hanging out with an acquaintance of mine. A local dealer much closer to her age. She had ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù for him‚Äî lol not the drugs of course. And I tried to warn her that the path she was choosing would ultimately be her downfall. I pleaded with her that even if we couldn‚Äôt be together just please don‚Äôt do what she was with who she was. All that hard work and sober time would be lost. Her son she was trying so hard to get custody back of would suffer for it. I spelled out for her what literally ended up being the next two months of her life‚Äî and I was right. Everything happened just as I said it would, up to and including losing complete custody of her 18 month old son. We broke up, she relapsed (well, she technically did before we broke up), and things went south for her fast. I should also mention that when we broke up I told her not to contact me anymore. That I needed to clear my head/emotions if we were to continue our friendship. I wanted her to be happy, but I knew I needed space‚Äî and she was not very happy about that. She threw it in my face how I told her I would ‚Äúalways‚Äù be there for her and I was her best friend. And I told her we needed space. We needed it or we would have nothing. Anyway. 

Now, I‚Äôm not a bad guy. And I do love her. And I‚Äôm the type that empowers, not controls, so her life was her life to live. But we have mutual friends, so I still checked up on what she was doing. And it wasn‚Äôt great. She was going bad. First came the alcohol, then the pills, and the party drugs, and finally‚Äî well, I don‚Äôt need to go there. I talked to her mother still after her and I broke up every couple weeks. I let her mother know abt this other guy and his business. Told her that I wasn‚Äôt giving up, that I just needed space. I still wanted her friendship, but things had been getting toxic and any friendship would be lost if we continued that toxicity. And I warned her mother to please just watch out for her. Please just be cautious. And I let her mom know some of what I was hearing here and there, but I made sure to emphasize that what I heard was just that‚Äî hearsay. Rumors. Things that could be or not be true, but I still wanted her to know. 
So during this time my previous ex and I had gotten back together sometime in July and got engaged again. And again, another dark, dark story. But one night my friend told my this girl had started doing what I dreaded she would. And I had to let her mother know. There‚Äôs a line, and I can let some slide, but I wouldn‚Äôt be responsible for an unnecessary death if I could have spoken up and said something. My previous ex wasn‚Äôt too keen on me still caring, but I‚Äôm sorry, a life is a life. So I called her mother the next day. I told her that her daughter was in a rly bad place and she needed, needed to get her back into detox/inpatient. Little did I know that she had OD‚Äôd the day before (the news I heard was abt a day late). The mother told me that her daughter was checking into rehab that next morning. And I asked her mother to please ask her daughter to call me. And she did. I told her that even tho I was away that I was always caring. I never stopped caring abt her as a friend. I let her know that I wanted the space to salvage our friendship, and if we hadn‚Äôt that the toxicity would‚Äôve ruined everything. And she finally saw that. She admitted to me that I had been right all along, but she just needed to learn it on her own. We talked for a good 30minutes before she was admitted, and we patched things up between us. This was now the beginning of August. 

So. My ex was getting the help she needed. I was engaged again to the woman I had been with for almost 14 yrs. And I had my alcoholism just abt under control, or so I thought...

Now this is where I mention without going into much detail that after my 14 year old relationship ended the year before I spiraled. Like big time. Spent thousands and thousands of dollars, suicidal, lost my job, drug/alcohol abuse like crazy, lots of sex with multiple women‚Äî many times in the same night. Just like for real I lost it. It was extremely traumatic for me. Hint: I wasn‚Äôt at fault for the breakup. Add to the fact 3 months before we broke up my 10 year old cousin committed suicide. It was just rough. 2019 was a horrible year for me. But during that year I started seeing a counselor and getting my life back on track. And tbh, things started getting way better for me mentally after I had met that girl in Feb 2020 and we started dating. Like I swear to god she saved my life. I believed in love again after her. And even tho we hadn‚Äôt worked out, the love I have for her is like none other I can explain. Like I rly don‚Äôt know how to explain it. It‚Äôs just there. Like it had always been there. Like everything that happened in my entire life led me to her. But yeah, she saved me. I would probably be dead by now if it hadn‚Äôt been for her. So there‚Äôs that tidbit of history. 

So, mid August my ex is in rehab and we‚Äôre talking here n there‚Äî pretty much just making sure she‚Äôs alright n stuff. I‚Äôm in a relationship. Engaged. The fianc√©e and I are trying to patch up our new relationship from what she had done the previous year. Things were looking alright for me. And then it happened. My fianc√©e left me again‚Äî for the same damn married man‚Äî AGAIN! And I loooooost it. It was like that whole year process of me getting back somewhat ok again was gone. The anxiety attacks. The hurt. The trauma. All of it. Only this time it was worse. It felt condensed. It felt like a year worth of hurt and anguish and the desire of death flooded back like a damn burst. I spoke to my ex in rehab 2 days after my fianc√©e left. And she pleaded with me‚Äî begged me to be careful. Told me when she got out she was maybe hoping she could move in with me‚Äî as a friend, of course. But I was gone. My sanity broke. My soul crushed. I wanted to be nothing‚Äî to feel nothing. See, my problem with alcohol is that I use it not to feel. To numb my brain. I literally had been on a bender for a little over 20 years. Sans 6 days in that 20 years I had not drank. That‚Äôs it. Less than a week in more than 20 years. And when I‚Äôm in a dark spot I would drink until I couldn‚Äôt feel. And then I‚Äôd drink more until I couldn‚Äôt move. And then I‚Äôd pass out and drink again the next day. I‚Äôm what they call a functioning alcohol. And I was for 20+ years until I wasn‚Äôt. That night I talked to my ex in rehab I told her I‚Äôd be ok‚Äî that I‚Äôd try to be safe. And I was for the most part. I was over a friends and then left for the bar. And then I got arrested after I left the bar around 10:30. I was somewhere in the 4-5x the legal limit, yet I was still sober in my mind. I literally still had hours left in me and another 20beers waiting for me that I left at my friends house. The bar was just going to be a quick in/out. Only had like 4 beers n a couple shots. But I had lost it. I ended up being arrested and thrown into the mental ward and put under suicide watch. The officer saw the cuts up and down my arms that I did a couple days earlier. Yes, I‚Äôm a cutter. I hadn‚Äôt done it in many years, but I was a wreck and I felt it was better to cut the pain away then to end the pain. But I‚Äôm not going to lie‚Äî I wanted to die. I was working myself up to killing myself. One last hurrah as it were. Because in my mind I had nothing left to lose. And I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt about to go where I had been again and deal with another year of that pain and suffering. I was over it. That night I ended up going exactly where I needed to. There was no wreck. No speeding. The cop watched me pull out of the bar and took a chance and got me. I‚Äôm not angry abt it. Everything in life happens just as it needs to. I firmly believe that. And this was my time. I spent the next 5days under suicide watch in the mental ward, and then was transferred to a 30 day inpatient treatment facility. I was able to call my ex‚Äôs mother (the one in rehab) to let her know what was going on so my ex wouldn‚Äôt get worried. I did talk to my ex in rehab the night after I got arrested. I wasn‚Äôt moved right up to the mental ward because I needed a COVID test first, so luckily I was able to speak to her once. 

Ok, so if you‚Äôre still bearing with me I am getting close to the end of the backstory. Thank god, right?! Lmao. 

Ok, so I got outta the psych ward and then made it to rehab. Called my ex‚Äôs mom. Told her how I could be contacted. The rehab I was in was great. And it was very low intensity. 3.1 compared to my ex that was in a 3.5 if anyone knows the difference. So I had access to my cellphone and everything where I was. Ok so my ex went in beginning of Aug and I went in mid Aug., so basically I was going to be in around 20 days longer than her. 

Well, while she was in rehab and I was dating my ex on the outside, my ex in rehab met some guy. A good ol fashion rehab romance. (Sweet right?! This story has it all! lol) And when my ex got out this dude AMA‚Äôd with her. Started living at her mom‚Äôs while I was in rehab. Now my ex assured me that this guy was only staying with her for a very short time as he needed a more intense 90 day program and was leaving for that shortly. Whatever. She told me she was ‚Äúenjoying the company‚Äù until then and it wasn‚Äôt anything serious. Ok. Whatever. Not like I could  talk or do much, or for that matter in any kinda mental space to even want anything other than working out my own demons. I needed to do me and get my head right again. So my ex and I talked a bit while I was in rehab. She sent me some nudes/videos for some reason I still can‚Äôt figure out. But whatever. Anyway, while I was in rehab she and new dude started using. Betcha didn‚Äôt see that coming?! She graduated from bumping to shooting‚Äî new dude‚Äôs preference. And then she OD‚Äôd again. I called her PO (while I‚Äôm in inpatient) and told her what happened and talked to her PO for quite awhile. I pleaded with her PO not to throw her in jail, but to get her back into rehab at a new place since the one she had gone to (twice now) was garbage. Her PO saw how much I cared and knew I wasn‚Äôt bullshitting her and so she was lenient on my ex and made her start an IOP program instead. And when I got outta inpatient I started the same IOP. Btw, not that it matters but I wasn‚Äôt court sanctioned into anything. I went to inpatient/IOP on my own. I needed a fresh start in life and something different. Ok, so I think we‚Äôre in the end of September now. I‚Äôm outta inpatient, she‚Äôs outta inpatient, we‚Äôre both in IOP, and dumbass dude is still living with her at her mother‚Äôs. Everyone for the most part is doing what they need to do‚Äî except dumbass dude. Ugh. He never ended up going for that extended treatment he was so intent on going to. Surprise, surprise. lol

Wellllll, as one might suspect she gets knocked up after abt a month and a half of knowing/being with this guy. Yay!!! Right? lmao happy ending!! Well, not quite. I should also say by this time her new dude HATES me. He, uh, well he goes through her phone/social media all the time. Reads all her texts/DMs/etc. Goes through her purse. Just very jealous and has no trust‚Äî kinda like the opposite of me I guess. lol. Well, he read and doesn‚Äôt like the text messages I had sent her from a couple months back and especially the fact he found the pictures/videos she sent me while I was in rehab and forbids her to speaking to me. I mean, we still did/do, but whatever. We‚Äôre like best friends. But like when she sent those, and I sent her the messages I did, they weren‚Äôt even dating so whatever. When they started dating I cut things off again. Told her that she‚Äôs with dude and I‚Äôd be her friend, but I was giving up. She of course didn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt want me to, but that‚Äôs where we were. Well, she ended up using again, falling out, and her mom/dude found her in the bathroom. He calls her PO the next day‚Äî one of the things I did he hated me for (called me a snitch)‚Äî and she gets sent back to inpatient again. She got out beginning of November and we‚Äôve still just been talking since. I mean, her and I never rly quit talking since we met. The only time pretty much was like those 2 months right after we broke up because I told her I would contact her when I was ready again. 

So, yeah, we‚Äôre like rly good friends. Like best friends really. We both trust each other and love each other and it‚Äôs just idk. It‚Äôs like nothing I‚Äôve ever had. For as fucked up n toxic at times and confusing and idk. It just is what it is. 

So since she got out in early November we‚Äôve kept our friendship up as we always have. It‚Äôs just a little different and not as open because we have to hide it from her boyfriend/future baby daddy. And since she‚Äôs been out she‚Äôs been sober. This past time combined with the fact she‚Äôs pregnant has really I think helped her for now. And I myself have been sober since I got out at the end of September or whenever it was. Except for one slip. My buddy‚Äî the one where me and this girl first met‚Äî passed away. And no, it wasn‚Äôt drugs. He had a blood clot in his stomach. It was sudden and just very unexpected. Him n I had been friends for about 20 years. And I planned on just drinking a shot n leaving one for him on the bar, but well, it was my wake up on why I cannot drink anymore because I couldn‚Äôt stop. But in the past 120days or so I relapsed once. I just never dealt with death before sober. Anyway, that doesn‚Äôt matter. 

So, one last thing and then I can get to my question stage and get some opinions I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt like. lol. So while my ex was in rehab this last time her dude started using again. Nodded out, burned tf outta her bedsheets, and just been lying to her and just all of it. Just getting high asf around her and giving no fucks. Hasn‚Äôt gotten a job, makes promises abt going back to school but doesn‚Äôt, keeps telling her he‚Äôs going to go to an IOP program and quit using, etc. All while he should be getting his shit together and saving and getting ready to take care of himself, my ex, and the baby. Mind you, I wanna say he‚Äôs 24, I think. Around that. Idk. But yeah, not my circus not my monkey. She made her bed there‚Äî quite literally. 

So this past weekend he left to go home to see his parents abt 4hrs away or so and was gone until today. And every day since he‚Äôs been gone my ex and I hung out. Went shopping and bought her son some Christmas gifts, went to the mall and walked around. We actually even kinda goofed around and went to the jewelry store and she tried on engagement rings. That was me being kinda sneaky there because it was sumin I always wanted to do with her when we dated that we never got to because of all the bullshit. Hell, we even found a rly nice one that she loved that was within my $7,000 budget (I think it was like $5,500 cuz it was 30% off, princess cut on a cushion kinda setting, carat and a half total weight, and sparkly asf). Lmao! But yeah, I mean we just had a great time all around. And I got to feed the fuck outta her. And I love feeding her. Lmao! Oh, another thing that should be noted is we both have eating disorders. I‚Äôm pretty much anorexic and she‚Äôs a chewer/spitter. Lmao!! We‚Äôre all kinda fucked over here, folks! But now that she‚Äôs pregnant she‚Äôs actually eating and taking care of herself, so I fed tf outta her finally! And we hung out a lot at her moms and just cuddled on the couch and watched tv n stuff. And no, we didn‚Äôt raw dog, or fool around or anything. It was for real just rly nice quality time that we hadn‚Äôt had in a long time now. Oh, and we exchanged Christmas gifts. I got her a Rick n Morty hoodie so she‚Äôll quit trying to steal mine and she bought me a rly soft Animal Crossing blankie. Just small stuff, but we loved them. It was just a rly fun time. 

So like, this is now where the problem is. She told me a lotta stuff Monday night. She told me that I‚Äôm like the perfect guy and she was stupid asf for not seeing it. I told her she wasn‚Äôt stupid‚Äî we were both in active addiction n we both had problems. She said  she completely trusts me and she loves me‚Äî I mean we‚Äôve always told each other we love each other, but I think she meant it a little differently this time. She told me she sees a future with me she doesn‚Äôt with him. She asked me if I still wanted to marry her‚Äî of course, yes I do; and just like a lot of other stuff. She told me she hadn‚Äôt planned on getting pregnant. Sent me a TikTok video of a daughter adopting her mom‚Äôs boyfriend and told me that could be me one day. Told me that she‚Äôs going to end up having 3 baby daddies because of me. And like a lot of other stuff. She‚Äôs not hiding the fact she‚Äôs interested in me still. 

But she also told me she does love this other guy, and she wants to give him a chance to step up and be a man. And I mean, I get it. She wants a clear conscience. She is pregnant with his baby after all. Like, I get her. I rly do. And I feel things like what she‚Äôs thinking. Ffs, I told her she was pregnant before she knew she was‚Äî dumb bitch owes me $50 for that btw! Lmao!! I‚Äôm just kidding abt calling her that, but frl. I was even the first person she told she was pregnant‚Äî even before her mother. Like I know why she wants to do what she‚Äôs doing, but it still sucks for me. And I told her I wasn‚Äôt waiting around for her. That if I find someone (even tho I‚Äôm not looking) I‚Äôll still be her friend, but I mean it‚Äôs all her choice. And she said she wants to give him a chance to keep his word and be sober. To get off the boi‚Äî which ain‚Äôt gonna fucking happen at this point in his life. But she wants to give him a chance. I called her out on that and asked her if I‚Äôm just an option then and she told me no. She thinks of him more of as the option because she sees me being in her life longer than him. Idk. Makes no fucking sense. 

But I mean, even months ago when she first found out she was pregnant I told her I was giving up hope on us being anything more than friends and I was ok with just friends as long as I was in her life, and she told me that I was being stupid and that we can‚Äôt predict the future. That things could always change with us. 

Like I rly do love this woman. I do. With all my heart in a way I‚Äôve never loved anyone, but I honestly don‚Äôt know wtf is going on in her head. And idk if she even does. She rly is smart asf, but like not at all when it comes to relationships. And maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 39 and she‚Äôs 26 and I was in a long ass relationship before her that I got a little more experience than she does when it comes to relationships, but idk. I mean, before her and I dated she dated her first baby daddy for 3 years and he was abusive asf to her. He got her hooked on shit and used it to control her. She doesn‚Äôt have many friends either. And like she‚Äôs insanely beautiful‚Äî like frl like model material, so most guys that come into her life rly only wanna try n fuck her, so she has bad history with that shit. And there‚Äôs been some sexual assaults in there too. So idk, I might be one of the few guys if any that‚Äôs actually treated her as not only a woman, but as a person. So there‚Äôs a lot going on in there I think. And I‚Äôm kinda at a loss on a lot of it. 

And like idk if it‚Äôs only her hormones making her think like this on top of it‚Äî even tho she kinda was saying some of this type of shit before she was pregnant. Like a lot of this is kinda just the same as how it‚Äôs been always been between us. And I wouldn‚Äôt mind being the step-up daddy to her unborn child, or to her first. I know it wouldn‚Äôt be easy, and there‚Äôs a lot that goes into raising a child/children, but I‚Äôm willing to do it. I‚Äôm willing to help her get her firstborn back and deal with all that court stuff. Like I will always, always fight for her and be there for her. I just want to help her and for her to have a happy life‚Äî whether or not it‚Äôs with me. 

But like I saw her yesterday before her boyfriend came back and I brought her some Chick-Fil-A (again, love feeding her n taking care of her) and like she literally sat on my lap and we just hugged and held each other for like 5-10min and then I got up to leave and we hugged again for a long ass time and then she kissed me on the cheek. I could tell she wanted to actually kiss me, but with her dating someone I knew she would‚Äôve felt guilty and didn‚Äôt want to do that to herself‚Äî she said she already feels bad enough over all this as it is. Like again, I can feel what she feels and it‚Äôs super weird asf. 

I just rly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on here. Anyone got any advice or insight besides get away from her? Any questions I should ask her, or like any topics I should bring up next time we talk? Like foreal, this is the part im here for. I‚Äôm not exactly the best at this relationship shit if you couldn‚Äôt tell by now! Lmao! I‚Äôm much better at getting fucked up and NOT dealing with life. 

I mean, I‚Äôm still working on me. I got a 3 bedroom house a few months back, just started working a government job that pays well, and I‚Äôm going to start working on my TEFL certificate for a side huddle, and then in a few month pursue getting my real estate license. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not doing me still or this is occupying my entire life. It‚Äôs literally one of the few things that idk what to do about. 

I think I gave a pretty good history on us and what‚Äôs going on here, but if anyone wants clarification please feel free to ask questions. 

And thank you if you‚Äôve read this far into it. I appreciate that and any opinions/suggestions/wisdom/insight/etc anyone has. <3",4,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5026184}"

2020-12-21 16:45:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/khr0e8/love_letter/,Love letter,"Dear Cathy, 

I chose you this week and weekend. You are amazing. You are starting to shine so others can‚Äôt help but see your strength and badassedness. Because you are choosing you. You are a better mother than you have ever been because you are choosing you. You are thriving at teaching because you are choosing you. 

On August 11th, you chose you. This process has been happening for a while as you have gotten stronger. Alcohol almost took that from you. I forgive you for thinking alcohol was your self-love and using that to take care of yourself. You didn‚Äôt know any other way because that is the only way that felt safe and good. The anxiety and the pressure felt too much to hold, but you‚Äôre doing it. You have done 4 and ¬Ω months on your own without Alcohol. And, you‚Äôre making it. You did good things while you were drinking and that time is not lost. Do not beat yourself up for that. You were already undoing the trauma that was your childhood. You chose not to be the mother you had from the get go and your children are better for it. You never would have stood up to your mom the way your children did last year. That was because you were not the Mom you had. You set boundaries to keep you and your family safe this year before Covid hit.  You didn‚Äôt know it then, but this would be the year you chose yourself. 

You began to love yourself. You are working out because you feel better, not to lose the god awful weight and meet expectations. You quit drinking during a time you always drank to cope. You knew there had to be a better way. That way wasn‚Äôt working anymore and you were losing the things you knew to be true, you are a great mother and great teacher. You said, ‚ÄúNot this!‚Äù Drunk Cathy would not be around anymore. You are doing hard things by choosing yourself and people who will love and support all of you, even when you‚Äôre loud about your recovery and your goals. You do not need to be timid anymore. 

You stepped out of what has been the best relationship in your life because you knew there was more. Someone to love you completely and who loves themselves. Someone who is willing to look inside like you are and become better than you were yesterday. You faced the pain and fear of being alone because the loneliness of not being understood or heard or accepted was no longer okay. 

Create the small habits that care for you in your time this break. You can do this. I believe in you and I love you. You know your life actions have been a result of your trauma and you are refusing to be controlled by that trauma. You choose to heal through the Emotion Code so that old trauma does not influence your choices. Keep prioritizing yourself. 

You have got some big steps coming up. Do not be afraid. Continue to grow and delve into who you are and grow towards the woman you have always been but have not let live out loud. You can say these hard things out loud and you will find the person to hear these things and love these things as much as you do. Let your knowing rise. The voice you have always heard say, ‚ÄúThis is not right.‚Äù The voice that led you to leave Greg even if you got lost in that journey.

I still don't like the culty vibe that the 12 step programs sometimes have with some people but the results speak for themselves for me. I hope to have many clean days after today, and finally not be a slave to the substance anymore.

Mind blown. I have believed in myself as a mother and as a teacher for a long time. Even when I was drinking, I knew I was a good mother and a good teacher until I saw myself
on 8/11
. I knew those things were on their way out the window unless I started loving myself and choosing myself. Finally the choices that I was making destroying myself were impacting what I knew about myself that I was a good teacher and a good mother. So, I had to stop so those two beliefs would stay true. And, I had to acknowledge that alcohol was starting to make those two things not true. My journey of self love began on that day. It was about loving the woman who was those two amazing things and letting go of what I thought helped me be those things and acknowledging the damage it was doing.¬†
My self love started with not drinking. It started with learning how to manage and feel all of those feelings about the demands of my children and my job and trust in myself to do those things without drinking. Further in my journey, I learned that I could fall apart because the feelings were so big. I could feel all of them and be an even better mom and better teacher because I let myself feel those feelings, fall apart, rest, and rise again. And that process is happening more and more often as I get closer and closer to my true self. Someone can believe in their ability to do things and achieve goals and still not love themself. I have done that for years. I know I have super powers as a parent and as a teacher. But showing myself love by not destroying myself with alcohol is my first real act of self love that I can look back on and know that I did because it was about me. I had to take care of me so those other things could continue to be true. I had to build up the supports in my life so that I could continue to not use alcohol. I gave myself the gift of time by going to meetings. I had never dedicated an hour to just myself in a day. Quitting drinking is an act of ultimate self love and supporting that decision and action continues and honors that act of self love.¬†

Choosing people to be in my life who honor, understand, and support that action and the journey of recovery for me is continuing that act of self love. Letting go of relationships that don‚Äôt reaffirm my self love has been the journey of the last few months. I let go of Sean in my recovery. I worked for so long and so hard to be worthy of his love. And now that I am outside of that, I realize I was dishonoring my worth. I can‚Äôt work to have someone love me. My worth is not tied up in my work. It is because I am. And I am learning if others in my life don‚Äôt see my worth, they cannot be part of my life. Dedicating time in my life to take care of myself is the ultimate act of self love. Was drinking taking care of myself? I used to think it was. And, now, I know that I was discounting my worth when I thought drinking made me better. Choose to love yourself. Begin with putting it down. Continue with honoring that decision and making your world and life something you don‚Äôt have escape from by drinking. Choose the people in your life based on how they support your journey of self love because that is truly what recovery is: learning to love yourself.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5313627}"

Addictive personality making life hard!,"Hello! I have been clean for almost four years after eight years of daily drug abuse. I went to rehab and went to 12 step meetings and so on for maybe two years. The last two years of my life i have quit meetings since i don¬¥t seem to need them to stay clean. So far so good.

My problem is that i have what i would call an addictive personality/i am an addict. I assume that many of you have the same problem, and i am curious about how you handle your lives due to this problem?

I feel like i have to eliminate everything that i find pleasurable in life since i get addicted to it. If i have an orgasm while having sex with my gf i want to cum all the time and i start watching porn and  get stuck in that, not good. So i have to do NoFap and avoid having an orgasm during sex.

I can not play video games, not even on my phone. I can not eat candy or cake or something that i enjoy eating because that will make me binge eat and gain 1kg/2pounds a week.

I have fully accepted that i can never drink alcohol or do drugs again, do i have to realise that i can¬¥t have sex, eat candy or play games neither or what do you think? How is it for you?

It feels like i had better controll in these areas earlier in my life but that might have been because the drugs was my main addiction. 

I have also been thinking that it¬¥s my mindset that is the problem. If i think that i can¬¥t game, have sex or eat unhealthy it becomes the truth, that what i have learned about addiction in 12 step programs have made me think and therefore act in this very addictive way.

I would like to be able to do these things in moderation but i might have to stop them all together forever to not be compulsive with them. 

TD;LR Do i have to eliminate all things that i find too pleasurable because otherwise i will be addicted to them and let them rule my life?

This post is longer than intended but I wanted to give nuance, background on my psychology/proneness to drug abuse/previous treatments/etc..

\~\~\~\~\~\~

Hey guys, anxiety ridden as I type this, fingers shaking... 24yr/old Male, 5'11"", I have never broken 125lbs. Maintaining a weight of 110 to upwards of 120 during a very good month. I have always wanted to gain weight but it's incredibly difficult even with full appetite, eating nutritious meals 2-3 times a day for months at a time (which is more than my usual).. My metabolism is much faster than most, (based on what my Phsychiatrist/Prescribing doctor said from experience)

Been on medications for Major Depression since EARLY High School (roughly 8th grade). Family history of serious depression, so it was more clear than for my brother when I was the same. Started with every SSRI you can name from Lexapro to Prozac. Tried treating it with a multitude of Mood Stabilizers, anti-convulsants, SSNIs, and many more. Lucky my dick still works with some decency...  Without fail, even when taking max doses responsibly, I always still had severe depression, that, while coming in waves of a month to 3 months at a time was constant to a point. Severity was the only change. Sometimes with accompanying suicidal thoughts.. During late high school, after dealing with MajDep Type - Recurrent, I was still depressed and did what any responsible young adult does--

&#x200B;

I experimented with a plethora of different drugs. Marijuana of course, LSD, MDMA (Not weekly or anything, but often not taking breaks like the recommended 3 months period..) Opiates, which I never really took a liking to, even when Actavis was still around and semi affordable.. Cocaine.. Then I found Xanax... It was my dream drug. Good for everything. Insomnia? Xan. Upset tummy? Xan and Weed. Depressed? 2 Xans and weed. Social Phobia I've had my entire life that stems from Mommy issues, as well as my now recently diagnosed ADHD was dead. I was confident, funnier and more outgoing. I had more friends, and honestly I finally felt like ""myself."" I hated drinking, hate drugs that induce nausea, and was sub-21, so if a party got raided or something, while I still always looked for my escape route upon entering any house, and putting either keeping on, or putting my shoes next to that window/door/etc, my goal as a kid was to never get a Minor (and I never did).. I just started getting invited to more parties and get-togethers than ever before because I didn't come across awkward and creepy like all through high school...

Then my good friend (who's probably the most button up kid you've ever met, very good with computers, Networks, SUPER smart, etc etc but decided to peep around the dark web). Queue him buying boats at a time,  me driving to his city, picking up 100-200, then sometimes upwards of 500 or more at times. Buying legitimate, real, 2mg Bars for about $2 a pop. GG249s..... Started selling for $4-$8 a pop depending on if you're a friend or not. Giving some for free to friends, taxing $10 a pill for others who don't know what they're doing... And doing some other real grimey shit during that period. Not only unknowingly addicted to the drug itself, but also the sight of a ziploc full of the drugs, the money that was coming in, and tbh the power that came with being the only person in the town that anybody knew our age (this is now 19-20y/o, post-graduation).

A bar would get me GONE, a 2nd later in the night was usually inevitable, even towards the end of that 8 months period, ending with my name on a Police Whiteboard in a local city along with my local friend that wasn't only my best friend (to this day, he's now sober) but \*protection and connection\* wielding as well. We moved spots, blocked the girl we heard snitched on us, moved towns, and started working.. Cleaned up for maybe 2 years. Still ALWAYS on some sort of prescribed meds...

And tbh, the withdrawals weren't too much worse than being laid up for several days..

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Queue my General Anxiety from there on out. Never had it before. ""Anxiety about.... Nothing? Wake up anxious?"" Yea I was antisocial/social phobia, but I didn't feel my heart beating outta my chest some days for no reason..

Tried treating it with a multitude of Mood Stabilizers, anti-convulsants, SSRIs, and many many more.

Close to two years ago I was so crippled from it, that I was experiencing severe depression and WEIRD symptoms we couldn't pinpoint.. Then what really made my doctor think ""Oh maybe more Anxiety related than I thought"" was feeling lightheaded and dizzy often times.

He prescribed .5mg of Klonopin 3 times a day. Didn't know how the hell a Benzo was gonna make me LESS fatigued, lightheaded, etc but ""who cares, I'm getting KPins!"" I picked them up that morning right after, took one, and by the time I got to work after my 45 minute drive I felt so normal, so elated, so motivated to work that I legitimately felt cured. I was amazed.. But after roughly a a few months, it was upped to 1mg Klonopin 3 times a day.

Then when I knew I was on the verge of losing my job, taking my 3 a day still, along with other medication combinations, the only ones staying consistently was Gabapentin and newly added Adderall, in addition to the Benzos prescribed just slightly before being prescribed Klonopin, which honestly saved my life for a second there. (Both the Adderall and the Klonopin felt like breaths of fresh air after struggling for so many years.) But the depression still persisted till I hit a serious wall Dec 2019. After I was hospitalized for such serious suicidal thoughts that I actually went and reached out to my doctor online for help. Police showed up to my house next morning, mom let them in not realizing she doesn't have to do that, and we don't trust police but she's a Saint who grew up Catholic and disobeying authority (or exercising rights, really) isn't in her fort√©, I don't blame her; they tried coming in my bedroom, I'm INCREDIBLY confused, they're saying I gotta go with them, and No wasn't an answer.

I simply don't trust police in my town, I've had bad experiences as a 16 and 17 year old getting caught with a dime bag of weed and getting searched and car torn apart while being belittled and laughed, at by main officer plus the K9 backup (w/ no dog present) seeing the enjoyment of kinda terrorizing a couple teens that really didn't do anything bad save for smoking a lil weed at the time- standing in a light jacket in 20 degree weather, while it's raining/sleeting.. Standing for over an hour just to get charged with drug paraphernalia from the two EMPTY baggies in my coat pocket. The ziplocs that buttons come in with a new shirt.. (Yes, one had green powder coating the inside from weed but c'mon that's it?)... Was on Piss Test Probation for about a year after that. Never cheated or failed a test, but still smoked daily until a week before.

Back to the officers in my home, they were actually kind enough to offer to let me ride with my mother to hospital while they followed cause I just wasn't going to get in their backseat, probably cuffed for their ""safety"" and honestly was probably truly willing to fight them in my mindstate if they tried to force me. I committed no crime and had no obligation to listen to them, nor have them enter my fucking bedroom so they got pushed into the hall real quick and we talked downstairs..

Went to ER, stayed the day. Refused to put on the gaping sheet that lets my ass hang out, I wanted MY CLOTHES.. I've got serious sensory issues- My therapist who diagnosed the ADHD also gave me an unofficial diagnosis of (SPD), Sensory Processing Disorder that has quite a bit of backing but isn't recognized. Anyways, they take my belt and shoes, so I can't hang myself from the ceiling tiles or something... I'm freezing, I get a blanket and these very dope socks for old people that are thick, warm and grippy that I still wear.

Then I talked to my Psych. He said we need to just get me thru this period and said, and I quote ""I don't know how to make this sound without coming off as strange... But for now we're gonna kinda turn you into a zombie, just so you don't 'care' so much. Brain needs rest, etc etc.""

He switched me from three 1mg kpins a day, to three 2mg Xanax bars per day. 90/mo. The addict in me said ""Wow, ok hell yea"" but I did stick to the script.. Really. Only taking less on certain days if anything.. In the beginning....

Then I needed the full 3 to get me thru. Then I sometimes threw in a 4th because I was still anxious.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

That brings us to present. So from December to December, I've been on 2mg Xanax bars 2-4 times a day. The list of meds I'm on RIGHT now are the Xanax, Adderall (40mg IRs x2/day), Buspirone (15mg tabs morning and night), Gabapentin(400mg x 3/day), am supposed to be taking Prozac with the Buspirone as well but stopped Prozac cause I didn't find it worth the money and money is tight now, and I just have way more Buspirone left over somehow. Will use till gone. And I'm not gonna cold turkey my Adderall and Xanax obviously.

I'm now thinking ahead and don't want to rely on having to take 5 pills when I wake up, 4 Midday, and another 3 at night, give or take a few if I miss a Busp, or skip a Xan, or Gabap, or an Adderall dose.

The Xanax is my focus and the biggest long term issue imo, so that's what I want to focus on. But I went 24 hours without and thought ""Yea I can definitely see how someone could die from this, cause I'm only a day in.....""

So with this cocktail of drugs I'm on, does anyone have any advice on how I should go about getting off them? I CERTAINLY need them right now. 12 hours without and my chest feels like it's full of air, pressured, ANXIOUS.

My only idea would be to taper, but I don't know the dosing and timing, I don't want to tell my doc to lower my dose and help in case I really just fucking need an extra but have a lesser script... (He doesn't know I need 4 a day sometimes, honestly I just say ""need a refill on Adderall and Alprazolam"" and he sends em to the pharmacy... He doesn't know the extent of my issue, so I don't want to cut a tool out of the toolbox. But maybe that's the addict talking....

Still, I can't afford therapy, and can hardly avoid visits with him, and I've told him that. That's why he doesn't do monthly checkups. I don't schedule them. I'm already drowning in Medical Debt from Mental Health treatment that ironically causes some serious suicidal thoughts at times when I see the bills they send. Being harassed by multiple collection agencies, and now LAW FIRMS asking for payment I couldn't ever possibly afford, threatening me (during a Pandemic, and now a Depression. Not Recession.. this is a Depression in America at this point let's be real, where I haven't had a job since March, and anxiety has only grown during this period, and I know this will be a very very dark winter... Not one I wanna be having suicidal thoughts and anxiety from acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms.. Not when I have Unemployment Insurance Appeal Court Case in January for some serious wrongful termination that I do have proof of but need confidence in presenting. For desperately needed, money that I'm legally certain I'm entitled to.)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

So, what do I do? Everything I read says taper with therapy. I can hardly maintain on current dose, tapering seems incredibly prolonged and difficult... And I simply will not be able to afford therapy along with it, nor recurring visits to my doc... Where do I start other than here? This is my first step in trying to fix this, and maybe I'm a few steps away from bringing my doctor in to the process.. But I stumbled across the subreddit and decided that support and advice from a forum is better than nothing, and is the least I can do when I'm cognizant that I'm not even supposed to BE on Benzos this long, let alone at this dose...

Any suggestions, stories of your struggles.. Anything. Constructive criticism is welcome, but please don't be too harsh I'm having a lot of trouble as it is and I just feel like I need to reach an arm out and hope someone grabs onto it for support.

I'm tearing up a bit now, tbh so I'll end it there, I've vented enough and given plenty of info for you guys, and if you need anything else please just ask. I will likely feel comfortable filling you in on any pertinent details possible..

Thank you and I'm sorry for such a long post.. I just haven't talked to another person- a friend... For probably 4 months. I cut off some, others cut me off. So I'm alone, save for my dog. But I need some sort of reinforcement or advice cause I don't know wtf to do. Thank you again, in advance. This sub seems like a reasonable place to start.

This was my second time in treatment. I had an idea on what sobriety looked like but I truly didn't know how to obtain it. Coming to treatment this second time I was sold on this dream that I can get and remain sober if I stick with the winners in recovery. So that's what I set out to do. I started watching the people in treatment. They read the basic text, got sponsors, became vulnerable talked to the counselors and staff. So in my quest of sobriety I decided to do the same. While doing that I would notice things in the basic text that didn't align with what was being done by the very same people who I considered ""winners "".  I started noticing flaws, character defects that would send the winners back into relapse one after another. I started questioning myself. I started questioning my judgement. Am I that naive? I took a step back recalibrated my thinking and started looking inward. What are my intentions I would ask myself in my room at night? I came across a part in in the big book saying this is a selfish program. I took that and that's where my new found journey in recovery blossomed. Getting through treatment was rough. It was rough because I searched for someone to validate my recovery only to be let down time and time again. So and so quest looks nothing like mines. I read the text, I asked questions, as my homie in treatment said I stayed away from the suckers.. and that got me through. I made it to the transitional housing program. I thought of it as a victory until the second I walked through the door. More of the same bullshit. More freedom meant more rope to hang myself with. Along with 6 others guys. My thinking was they got this far I can do the same. Truth is I was in a smaller version of the same bullshit I escaped in the treatment center with added stress.. I'm getting turned down from work because of my past. I'm surrounded by men who confuse accountability and snitching. Now we are adding women to the situation so the 13th step is dropping dudes like flies...  I started questioning myself again, fell into a depression, and truthfully considered using again. That's when it hit me. With everything going on, I'm still sober. And that became a victory in itself. I started searching for things to occupy my time. I enrolled into college. I maintained a level of self love that cant be damaged. Lowered my standards on employment found a job in fastfood. And now I have a sense of hope. I have a guide. I'm not where I want to be but now I have goals to work toward. This shit ain't the breeze I thought it would be, but for the first time in my life I'm content with my progress. I'm proud. I hold my head high and flip the shit outta some burgers. I know more challenges are awaiting me but truthfully I'm not even looking that far ahead. For right now my needs are met. I gotta money in my pocket, and last but not least I'm sober.  And cant no one take that from me.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6008254}"

How death saved my life.,"Addiction has been a huge struggle for most of my life. My DOC is IV meth. I had a good chunk of clean time until I was raped in Iraq by a fellow soldier in 2011. The next almost decade has been filled with death and drug use. 8 soldiers to suicide, one of whom was a close friend and lover, multiple family members, friends. My dog. My mom and dad. Then I found my real dad. My best friend went to prison. We were really close. Like platonic soul mate close. She got out. On July 8, we got high. I went home. On July 10 I got the call at 12am that my dad had passed away from alcoholism. The next day, I found out my best friend had also died on the 10th of heroin overdose. I was crushed. So angry. Absolutely destroyed. That moment caused something to click in my brain. I haven't used since that day on July 8th. I made a promise to her mother that I wouldn't use again. I made a promise to her childhood best friends. Most importantly, I made a promise to myself that I would not let her death be in vain. I've made a commitment to sobriety. All my paraphernalia is gone. Online meetings are a thing now. We still have in person meetings. I got a face shield so I could go. (PTSD and masks don't mix. I can wear one to run into the store real quick. For a 90 minute meeting, I'll wear a shield.) This is the most sober time I've had since 2011. I think the one thing I was missing was that total commitment. I will not use. Her death has to mean something and this is the only way I can make sense of it. I'm looking forward to Jan 8th. Six months clean is a huge accomplishment. I haven seen this in a very long time. So, I'll be there. In person to collect that chip. I haven't collected any of the others because I've done all that before. 6 months. It's so fucking big. I miss them all so much. Greiving while sober is literally the hardest thing I've ever done. Being present in that grief. Feeling that grief. It's horrible. It's also so, so cleansing. I'm nurturing my grief like I nurtured my addiction. Paying attention to it. Processing it. I'm letting the tears come. I'm letting the laughter come. I'll grow Sunflowers in her honor in the spring. I'll make sure there's a trucker hat and a guitar in there for my dad. Grief isn't the enemy. Grief is healing. I'm finally learning that.

In that time I've endured losses and celebrated amazing changes & additions to my life. Here are some things I'd like to share with this community.

1. Life doesn't stop just because you got sober. Expect change - some good and some bad - even after you've put down the drinking and the drugs. I've lost a brother, a marriage and a career in sobriety (and in a single calendar year, actually). I've also gained a much more fulfilling new career, an amazing family (two partners and two children with a third on the way), and even moved to a new state where I've established a great life that is so much closer to the person I really am.

2. Stay humble, be honest, and have integrity. Humility allows me to not take things too personally - I'm just another person stumbling around through this world trying to figure things out as I go along, just like everyone else. So long as I am honest FIRST with myself, I can be honest with others. It also helps me keep my thoughts, words, and actions all in alignment and that integrity allows me to like myself - an important thing for me to stay sober. These are things I learned from working AA's 12 Steps. While I am certain there are other ways to learn them I couldn't tell you what those are.

3. Find your thing that helps you feel connected to something bigger than yourself. I've read a few sociological/psychological studies (can't find links; sorry) that talked about a sense of connection and community being what helps people stay sober and that jives with my own personal experience. In sobriety I've found a couple of things that get me there - one of which I was involved with before drinking/drugging and the other which I've discovered in sobriety. Whatever your thing (basket weaving with a group, basketball with friends, meditation, etc.) just make sure you do it with people that respect your sobriety.

That's really all I can think of right now. If this post helps even one person then I am happy. Feel free to DM if you want to know more about my journey, need some support, or you just plain want to chat!",116,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8046581}"

Quitting drinking is the easy part. Unbecoming everything that led me trusting alcohol as the soother of all things is harder. Why did I use alcohol to sooth my feelings of being different overwhelmed. Partly, because if I said thing too out loud, I caused pain for everyone else. And that is still holding true because I am not okay with the status quo. You can't be in my life right now without looking at things harder. And relationships where I can't say things out loud are becoming weaker and estranged. While the relationships where I am my authentic sad and happy and supportive self are flourishing an thriving. But that voice to sooth and manage the anxiety with alcohol is still there. I've lived with that voice and followed that voice since my brother first had a party at our house when I was in 4th grade, the first time I had a beer. When my family had fun, there was alcohol. It wasn't often, but I saw it. When I was 17, I drank to hang out with my 21 year old boyfriend. I drank to silence all my insecurities. I drank to deal with the huge sexual steps I was taking that I thought I had to do to keep an older boyfriend. I drank to deal with the conflict in my family because I was no longer satisfied with the way we did things and being overlooked. I had found other families who thought I was amazing even if my family didn't. In truth, I was still working towards so many things that would finally make my family believe in me and be proud of me. I used alcohol to silence their voice of disapproval that said I was too much. 

This process of becoming is hard because friends are reluctant to agree with me now because agreeing with me means taking a long hard look at their own drinking. Confronting that your drinking is problematic is so hard because we don't want to give it up. When I quit drinking, I didn't think it would be for good until it was for good. And choosing that every time I want to drink is so hard. And, I am learning my friends who saw the drunk me and who are worried that will happen again cannot ride the road of growing with me and that makes me sad. They go back to the Cathy in July who was in so much pain and the alcohol wouldn't fix it. I see that as the eventual outcome if I ever use alcohol again to numb my pain. This becoming is difficult and a challenge. I think people who drink can go on my journey with me, but they have to be willing to step into the light of their own drinking and recognize and name their own patterns. Our society says moms need wine. Just look to the Tropicana Closet Mimosa Bar. Our society says teachers deserve wine to cope with teaching in 2020. Ask yourself if you have given bottles of wines or gift cards for alcohol to your son or daughter's teachers. I know I have. For most of these groups of moms or teachers, this is not a big deal. But for those few, it is a huge deal and it is a monumental for them to say no and find their voice in this culture. My post about Tropicana has 0 likes. No one is willing to touch it with a 10 foot pole. Maybe you read my blog to help find your voice in my struggles. Sobriety only starts with putting down the bottle. It grows with your unbecoming what the world says is okay and forging to find what you say is okay for you and is your truth.",22,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44052276}"

I‚Äôm over six months clean from Vyvanse abuse now, and even though I feel awful at the moment, on the third day of a rough PAWS patch, I‚Äôm trying to remind myself that I have seen signs of improvement recently.

But that‚Äôs how bad PAWS can be: I can have ten days of unambiguous improvement, feeling my feelings, getting things done, becoming more hopeful, and then a single bad day of PAWS--let alone three--can cast doubt upon all my progress and upon any hope that I‚Äôll ever feel normal again.

When I force calm upon my thoughts, I know that having nasty symptoms six months into recovery is entirely normal and no real indicator of my recovery prognosis--in just another few months I might feel awesome--but I still have a hard time really believing that reasoning. When the symptoms act up, I lose all hope so fast.

Fucking up your brain chemistry really puts typical feelings in a new perspective. Hope, for instance, must be some expectation (an idea) plus a positive feeling associated with that expectation. Without the positive feeling, the expectation means nothing and hope becomes impossible.

I want to articulate a few of the feelings because a) writing it out is slightly soothing, b) I hope one day to recover and to be able to show future sufferers what depths they can recover from, and c) I need to scare myself into never ending up like this again.

1. How I can be so tired yet so unable to sleep is unfathomable to me. I have slept only a few hours for each of the past nights, but if I try to sleep when I‚Äôm anything less than absolutely exhausted, my body throws itself into a panic for no clear reason.
2. The anhedonia is unbearable. Formerly enjoyable activities leave me numb, while the smallest tasks overdraw my motivation account. My brain seems to have the impression that food will get the neurochemicals flowing, but it never does, so instead I stew in guilt for overeating. I fear my boyfriend would feel betrayed if he knew just how incapable I am of feeling the joy and affection he used to inspire in me. I still love him, I‚Äôm certain, which tells me that the roots of love are deeper than mere feeling, but on days like today the glow is gone.
3. The mechanisms for feeling negative emotions, on the other hand, are mostly intact: shame not just for the drug abuse but for all the fucked-up things about me that drove me to it; regret because I know I once had everything I needed to live a good life but was ungrateful and therefore squandered it all in a selfish attempt to take more than my share; and a pale unpoetic depression that refuses even to be elevated into a more exciting emotion like rage or devastation. In fewer words, this shit sucks and sucks *boringly*.

I woke up this morning watching my daughter smile, turning 10 months old, knowing she never has to see her dad high, and myself smiling in the mirror turning 28 years old, happy. Something I never thought I'd be. I'm proud of myself today. I believe in myself, my daughter has her daddy, the mother of my daughter has her person back.

Wtf is my brain doing?,"Hi, everyone. Please bear with me, as I'm extremely confused/concerned and I'm not sure how to beat explain it.
As far as drugs go, I used any/everything I could, but for the last year and a half of active addiction, my DOC was methamphetamine. 
I also happen to have ADHD (currently unmedicated). When I am on a low dose of stimulants of any kind- prescribed or illicit- I see improvement in symptoms involving concentration & executive functioning. But once I reach my body's limit/surpass it and am just compulsively using, I actually tend to be more hyperactive/hyperfocused, I'd say even manic. 
All that to say: I'm around 4 months clean from all substances, but for the last week or so I've been feeling like I'm on a high dose of meth: trying to do all the things on my list at once while simultaneously adding things to the list, however what I do accomplish isn't what's most important at the moment; hyperfocusing/ getting stuck on one action (such as surfing reddit) for hours despite needing and wanting to do other things; increased heart rate; extreme fatigue comparable to having been awake for days on end...
My new job has my sleep schedule all out of wack, too, and my stress and anxiety have been through the roof for a couple of months, so that may be contributing..

Bottom line, wtf is this?? PAWS? Exacerbated ADHD symptoms? (Am I creating irrelevant ties between meth use & ADHD?) Some weird stress-related shit?

I genuinely feel like I've been awake and on one for about 5 days. It's bizarre and extremely uncomfortable and not at all pleasant.

Any/all input is greatly appreciated.

Thank y'all in advance & may everyone have a fantastic day. And remember- 
We Do Recover.


*EDIT*
*Update*

GP says I'm likely to be bipolar and that what I'm describing does sound like it. Also, she's my childhood best friend's mom, so she's known me for 20 years and practically raised me- if I wasn't home, I was at her house. So I trust her education & her opinion. She's setting me up with an appointment with a mood disorder specialist that she recommends from personal experience. 
I can't thank y'all enough. I NEVER would have considered bipolar disorder. And even if it ends up not being what it is, at least the process of elimination will be moving along and we can explore whatever the next avenue is.",31,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5032708}"

Can CBD help?,"I don‚Äôt want to beat around the bush so I‚Äôll get right into it. I would say I have been dependent on benzos of some time for about a year now after initially using them to help me come off opiates which I am clean from illicit use for more than 2 years but still taking 11mg of methadone per day. 

I was taking around 2-3mg per day of Xanax at my peak, reducing to 8mg of diazepam for a few months then a medical prescribed reduction as follows:

1st week: 8mg/day
2nd week: 6mg/day
3rd week: 4mg/day
Last week: 2mg/day

Everything was going fine until I got to 2mg and towards the second half of the week things started to get nasty. I felt like how I imagine a woman on her period feels, irritable, sensitive, emotional, struggling to sleep. I ended up continuing to take 2.5mg of diazepam daily after I was supposed to have stopped, with the understanding of my recovery worker who agrees that the taper I was put on was too rapid.

Things have gotten a bit better and anxiety is fairly minimal compared to when I came off xanax before and struggled with panic attacks and seizures, but I am really struggling to sleep. I wake up every morning after a maximum of 4 hours of sleep generally and I feel awful. I wake up with a tightly clenched jaw and bunched muscles and my hands gripping like claws. It takes me some time before I even start to feel better. I notice if I try to sleep in more than 4 hours the feeling is worse. I could deal with it if it was just like this for a week or two but it has been almost 2 months on 2.5mg and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting any better.

I work full time and most days it is a painful struggle to get up and go to work. Getting enough energy to even shower and do routine tasks is difficult.

Anyone who has been here before, is this normal? I‚Äôve been through countless opiate withdrawals and I always found the restlessness and insomnia to be the worst. It‚Äôs really starting to grind me down feeling like I won‚Äôt ever feel normal again or be able to take care of myself and keep my job.

I got a bottle of 300mg x 10ml full spectrum CBD vape oil today. Has anybody found CBD helpful in alleviating benzo withdrawals?

Sorry if this is a bit of a ‚Äòpoor me‚Äô post but I feel like we‚Äôve all been in this spot with withdrawals and if it was opiates which I‚Äôm more familiar with, I could handle it, but although similar and easier in some ways after the taper, the lingering insomnia and the fitful disturbed sleep and the way I feel in the morning when I wake up are really starting to grind me down mentally. I have a surgery with general anaesthetic the day after tomorrow and the recovery from that will be painful enough without this added on top. Any kind words or advice are appreciated especially from anybody who has been through this specific symptom which is hard to describe but a mixture of akathisia and insomnia.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7248177}"

From all the lack in my life, year after year, lacking basic fundamental needs I have never fulfilled, my parched soul still screams. 

Can you hear it? It takes a toll on me, as it does many who grew up like I did. That is why my focus is on getting those needs met, because I am then in better shape to help others. I hope my focus will be clear. 

Beginning with the basic needs all children need to grow into happy healthy children, I received hatred and abuse. There was no way for me to grow up confident or happy. Every day was a struggle for survival battling the three people society and my school told me were the people I could go to for comfort and unconditional love. 

As the youngest, I somehow survived a childhood so traumatic my family locked it away in amnesia by overwhelming me, bullying me, and teaching me hatred. I know beliefs fuel behavior; what did they lock away in my head that something might trigger horrid buried deep inside me I know nothing about because I cannot reach it? 

As expected, because of that monstrous upbringing, I have multiple mental and physical health problems. From clinical depression and complex ptsd up to autoimmune health problems, spinal stenosis, morbid obesity, and crippling chronic fatigue, I wonder how different my health could have been if I had grown up in a healthy home. 

Would you like to know what is worse? There are billions of people around the globe who know this firsthand because they survived it too. Sadly, many have not. Not all of us make it out of domestic violence alive, I am heartbroken to say.

An abusive childhood not only burdens the child's mental and physical health, it does not prepare them for life as an adult.  Depression‚Äôs burden leaves kids starved and needy for any attention that can get, even unhealthy attention that leads them into sexual abuse and incest. 

I know that because one of my abusers bullied me into it and the second I took part in, willingly.

Carrying the suffocating burden of child abuse and domestic violence is like dragging around tons of putrid toxic waste and having to make it through each day despite that megaton weight.

Is it any wonder the abused end up acting out, become addicts, disabled, in poverty, unable to help in their communities because that toxic waste is an enormous obstacle they cannot get through. 

Because of that, their lives are a huge, long distortion, littered with mental illness and physical illness, products of self-loathing and self-destruction to such a degree that they may never know their talents.

From experience, please don't ever try meth. It seems so casual and is a shit ton of fun, but damn does it wreck your life.

It puts a hook in your brain that never goes away. The hook is there forever. 

By hook I mean the desire to do it, the craving the taste and pipe and experience. You can easily rationalize it as being less severe than it is.

Imagine everything dear and precious to you. Family, friends, pets, hobbies. Meth will take it away. Meth strips your emotions and empathy and you lose the emotional connections with everything. 

And every second of pleasure you get, you will pay back  to Meth after you use it.

Anyway I purchased an amp that should arrive this week and I hope I can get back into my music and stay off of the bottle. And I can't wait to finish my Xanax taper and be pure and clean ready for the new year.

But I really get a sense that for most people (or people on the outside as I use to say) they have this belief / stereotype that someone with addiction must be a drug addled homeless individual in a dark alley somewhere. At the height of my addiction, I still had a job, still went to work - still functioned. I think a lot of people would be surprised by that. Some of the other misconceptions I've heard / faced.  


\- It's a choice, you can stop if you really want to  
\- You didn't have to start  
\- Once an addict, always an addict  
\- You've been sober for years, surely you can have one now  
\- After years of doing fine, why would you go out again?  
\- You can't possibly be addicted to THAT  
\- I was able to stop, why can't you?  
\- You're just using that as an excuse  
\- That we don't love those around us.  
\- That their actions and words don't hurt us

(I thought) I had some really important friends and relationships. I felt like I had a group and we were there for one another.   
As I cleaned up, I focused deeply on my mental health and as it came together, it also all started falling apart. I saw through so much of the illusion around me. I tried to keep involved with socializing (pre covid), I went out and partied but I stayed clean. It was a nightmare. It was all too obvious how none of us actually had friends at all, we were just doing drugs and validating it together.   
My mother died this year due to Covid complications. I had just met her for the first time in my life, last year.   
We lived in separate countries but she came to visit as soon as we connected. I got one week with her, I was clean so I'm so happy for that. I invited my closest friends to come and meet her too at a little get together at my place.   
Each one of my friends were so messed up, it was an absolute embarassment.   
My 'best friend' brought a gf that got so drunk, she sucker-punched me in the face and broke my tooth out of nowhere.   
Another friend tried to drive home drunk and ran into a parked car outside our place as she left.  
I was so embarassed and angry, I couldn't believe I had allowed myself to be associated with these people. I was mortified that my mother saw that as one of the first introductions  to what I did with my 30+ years since being adopted.   
When she died, I wasn't allowed to travel to be there due to Covid lockdown. It's been a mess for my depression but I've stayed clean.   
My friends know about my mother dying but haven't really said anything. I didn't really reach out about it to be fair and I've always resented them all a bit for that night they met her.   
I keep telling myself that although I'm lonely and isolated, I'm making the healthiest decisions I've ever made to date. I'm clean, healthy and focused on work/projects.   
I don't know what it's been lately, maybe it's Covid isolation making me lonely or something but I've really hit a low depressed state again. I'm starting to question myself and what I'm doing.   
I worry that I've not given people enough of a chance. Maybe I lack patience. Maybe I'm not a nice person for writing people off, being selfish, all these things.   
I feel like I've been going through the biggest and hardest things I've ever faced and I'm completely invisible. I have no friends, no family, no support. At first I felt empowered but now I feel like I just don't know how to exist and like I just don't matter.   
I don't know how to be sober and matter to people. I'm feeling so insecure about... everything.   
I've started having dreams about relapsing and very small cravings. For the first time I'm just feeling scared and hurt and angry about it all.

I used this checklist to decide.,"When I decided to quit drinking 44 years ago in September there was no question, I was drinking  too much. I was blacking out almost every time and waking up to people I didn't know in places I'd never been not knowing how I got there or what I did. Usually it wasn't good.  I suffered some very bad consequences. Fortunately avoided killing anyone by driving drunk!

But after I started drinking 10 years later because...well you know...Jesus turned water into wine for a wedding so it must be OK to drink.... it was all downhill from there. I should have had a clue after that first glass of hard apple cider.. I wasn't satisfied until the bottle was gone. And so it went for another 10 years...going from the glass of wine to the bottle, to the small box, to the big box.... .. But you didn't drink wine with fish fry...that came with a pitcher of beer... and when you mowed the lawn and went fishing... so it went from a 6 pack to a case of beer too. Different occassions called for different beverages. Or... eventually, whatever was available.

By the time I finished my masters degree and was a full fledged counselor I had also become a pretty full fledged alcoholic. It was one of my clients and a couple of colleagues that challenged me to consider whether I was drinking too much.  I rationalized that because I hadn't lost my job, I didn't drink in the morning, I hadn't ended up in jail that I was in control.  These are some of the questions that I had to ask myself.... I didn't like the answers, so in March of 1996 I quit.  In April I went to Florida on vacation, and of course you can't go on vacation with friends who drink and not drink, so once again made a fool of myself and that was it. Last drink was April 6, 1996.

I decided to check off which one‚Äôs fit... there were way too many! 

1. Have you used this to escape dealing with feelings?
2. Have you felt that you should cut down?
3. Is it causing problems with family, friends or work?
4. Have you gotten annoyed when people express concern about it?
5. Did you feel guilty after doing this behavior?
6. Did you sneak it or do it in private so no one would find out?
7. Is this costing you money or time you don‚Äôt have to waste?
8. Are you at risk of getting in legal trouble for doing it?
9. Is it causing you health problems?
10. Does it make you feel separated from God- your higher power, when you are doing it?

I have ADHD and began taking adderall at 20. I quit after 14 years of daily, constant use 15 months ago. I only ever took it as prescribed until a traumatic situation pushed me over the edge. I started taking more and also drinking and after about 3 years of doing this, my body completely shut down Last year.  I would have panic attacks constantly, I became agora phobic, life was absolutely miserable and I was terrified. I turned to my doctor and he immediately cut me off. At that point it wasn‚Äôt a big deal because things were so bad I think I was in a reverse tolerance situation. I went from being able to have 80 mg per day to not even being able to handle a few granules. In hindsight, I do regret going to my doctor because now I have cut off my supply (Should I need it again). Something inside me knew it was absolutely time to quit and more importantly, physically I couldn‚Äôt handle it. So 15 months ago I quit drinking entirely, quit adderall and benzos.

&#x200B;

The worst part is that I actually do have adhd and my productivity is horrible now And I do miss it. If I were to try and get it again I would have to try to find a different doctor and I have a fear that they will somehow know what happened or ahve a sense of what happened and not prescribe it. I don‚Äôt even know if trying to go back on is the answer as it seems my body chemistry changed. I just know that when i was on it and things were good, it did help with depression and focus and weight control And MOTIVATION. My sex drive is also gone. It is much harder to motivate myself and I do not concentration is so tough- even watching movies or tv is very difficult. Ideally, I would love to be a success story that can lose weight, feel pleasure and live a full and productive life off of this drug but I am not there yet.

It was perfect and my situation with criminal activities and drugs abuse became so distant. They let me go 7 months after and i was finally headed towards a better life. A life with a normal me, with normal and good tendacies. Good family relationships. Me being able to help my younger brothers and my mom.   


4 years later. I Just broke up with my girlfriend a month ago. Me and her met way too early, I wasn't ready and she wasn't doing very good mentally either at that point. We've been together for 3 years. So i've had a relapse every fucking weekend since and it sucks. Yesterday i spent 20000 on cocaine and  hookers. How do i feel? Like shit. I miss my fucked up girlfriend. I miss the presence, the safety and the connection. But i know deep down that it is fucking bad for me and her. Told my mom about this. She didn't give me the slaps i deserved but instead some understanding - which was much nicer.

Update:
Thankfully, I'm feeling a bit brighter now. I have so much to be thankful for.

When I look back to those dark days I can't believe just how bad I'd got. Most of the memories are panicked, desperate feelings and obsessions. It was an absolutely horrible way to live and I never want to be like that again. However, there's still that little voice in the back of my head reminding me how good it felt. And oh my god, did it feel good. I've read a little about how drugs rewire the pleasure centre of the brain but I've not found anything saying how to reverse it or if it can be reversed.

Turns out it's spider mites, so I end up spending 4 hours spraying down the room with isopropyl, trimming and washing and hanging the buds. I wake up to her loudly vaping so I tell her we have a spider mite infestation. Boom shut down again. 

I'm just so tired of this. She's an ex marine, shes broken her back and it's the 10th year anniversary of that so it just blows my mind she has no backbone at all to accept the reality of life without villianizing me. The first time I made an inventory of my behavior and apologized but this time im having a hard time. She didn't/doesn't do any research ever, she smokes and just loves to play the victim. Not sure what to do because it feels like I can't ever be honest with her and just have to coddle her. If I ever talk about my trauma she always tries to one up me and I'm starting to feel like I can't be myself and open up without being trivialized or villianized.

Ok so I (26M) have a cousin (25M) who is addicted to meth (among other stuff but mostly meth). He's been using maybe around 2 years. At some point over a year ago, because we don't use our garage, we agreed he could turn it into his own personal tool shop where he can store all his tools (saws. Wrenches, workbenches, basically what you'd imagine someone who is really good with their hands and plumbing would have). We agreed because it keeps him busy, and acts as home base for the various odd jobs he picks up. He runs his own small business picking up odd jobs here and there from building fences, to plumbing work, to restoring houses and water heaters. Hes kinda a jack of all trades master of none. At first it was a cool agreement. He uses our garage to work out of and stay busy (and hopefully stay sober) and in return he occasionally helps out with repairs needed around the house. Then he started doing meth.

At first no one noticed, then things got worse from there. Suffice to say that he's been erratic in the last 6 months as far as work consistency is concerned. Most of his family has cut him off completely, calling him a druggie and writing him off. My family is really all he's got left. I told him he had to stop using if he wants to continue using our garage. I've been patient, listened to him vent, and he's quit now multiple times ranging from a week to a month. He's talked to a few professionals, went to rehab for two weeks, and swore up and down he'd stop. Then the voices started talking to him

See now, he's convinced the government or some really bad people are watching his every move. They're hacking his phone, stealing his tools out of the garage, following him around town. He's absolutely CONVINCED that he's hacked and being watched. He hears voices insulting him, they whisper that his stuff his being stolen, he CONSTANTLY locks himself put of his cell phone because he changes his password so often.
Sometimes I hear him talking to himself.


I'm at a loss here. Whereas before, I more or less had solid advice for someone struggling with addiction, he's borderline schizophrenic all the time now. I'm completely out of my depth here, I mean I was before the voiced started, but now? I have no idea how to help him. Just recently, he showed up at my house 48 HOURS without sleep, completely paranoid mumbling about hackers. I calmly keep explaining in detail how its not possible, but of course he doesn't believe me. I mean I don't blame him for not believing me. I have no idea how I would react with voices constantly lieing in my ear.

So it seems I'm at a crossroads. I told him months ago he was to NEVER show up here high, and that he had to be clean to continue to use our garage. But now? I really don't know. His workshop is one of the few things that keeps him busy. Its his job, ya, but also his passion. He just loves making stuff. He great at it too. Now that almost everyone has abandoned him I don't want to take away the one thing he loves too.i feel like he will just turn to meth MORE after I take it away, and he won't learn a thing. 

So why write this long winded post?
Well, I'm completely out of my depth here and was wondering if anyone had some advice for me here. Anything at all really.

How do I deal with these schizophrenic episodes?

Do I take away the garage in hopes it gives him a wake up call? 

Rehab hadnt helped, talking hasn't helped. Calmly supporting him hadnt helped, I'm at a loss here. I know I can only do so much but man, with my own depression and problems, lately this feels like ALOT. at what point do I cut him off completely? I just wanna help him out but this is turning into a full time gig. Any and all advice is GREATLY appreciated. I've never dealt with anything like this.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5296784}"

I'm sober almost 500 days, am grateful for it, but I'm increasingly frustrated by -- and alienated from -- AA. Some of this has to do with the structure and rhetoric of the steps; in practice, for example, when working with a sponsor, it aways seems my problems aren't dramatic enough for the steps. 

In a bigger sense, though, my alienation from AA stems from a circular logic I've found there: When you bring up some of the problems that AA and the steps raise for you, the solution is always AA and the steps (to be hyperbolic, that's much like drinking: solve the problem with more of the problem). Because of this, admitting my own problems with the program often feels like my own failure. I know AA is not the place to seek alternatives to AA, but it's hard to find spaces and communities outside of AA.

There is only one other meeting here in our entire county and it's celebrate recovery. I attended their meeting and felt we needed an NA meeting ran by people who have had very serious addictions to drugs of all kinds for many years because as we all know addiction and what the addict has been through can't truly be learned from a book. Not that I'm saying those who aren't addicts working in this line of work aren't as helpful and worthy so don't get what I said twisted r take it the wrong way. I feel everyone who is doing their part to help addicts are great people who deserve recognition for what they do. Anyway back to what I was saying, we saw there was a huge need for NA here so we asked an elder of our church if we could hold meetings in the fellowship hall and he gave us a key and the go ahead to have our meetings one night a week. Now as we grow we may start having more meetings through out the week but we feel once a week is great for now. We're also holding virtual Zoom meetings alongside the in person meeting we have. Considering we know so many people who are addicts recovering/active addiction both alike we have alot of people wanting to attend our virtual meeting this Saturday. I ordered some literature and a starter pack as well as sent an email to the NAWS website to get our meetings listed but my main concern is the reason to be alot of people attending this Saturday and I need some advice on how to make it more interesting so the people joining us for the first time this weekend will want to continue to come back. I've learned from last Saturday doing virtual meetings is much harder as well because no one except for me and my fiancee have any of the reading material so I end up reading everything which is going to end up getting old. I want to know how we can get everyone involved and the best way to go about it? Also I spent alot on the books and stuff and am curious if it's okay to ask members to donate to help fund the meeting so we can continue buying more literature and maybe even order our members journals and the steps book?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5320855}"
