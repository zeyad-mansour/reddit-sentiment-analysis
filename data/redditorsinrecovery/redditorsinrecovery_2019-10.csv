He's a recovered meth addict, about 2 years now. He's very healthy, happy, etc.

My question is about sex. When we have sex, sometimes I feel like he just isn't there - off in ""another place"". My mind races, it makes me anxious and sometimes takes me out of the mood. Because I wonder about how his relationship with sex while being high for a couple years might have an impact on how he has sex now.

Is sex different for recovered meth addicts, and if so, how? What's that journey like?

Trust me, I know communication is key. I've asked if things are good, but he reassures me things are great. I just wonder if there are ""things I should know"" from those who have experiences with Party and Play (PNP), ways that I can support him or be a better partner. Ways that I can overcome my own anxieties. Any insight helps.

TL;DR: Unsure about my sexual relationship with my partner who used to PNP/use meth.",5

I could control it. Well... until now. I'm 34. I started using meth when I was 16 and played around with it up until almost three years ago. I've now started to drink so much that I black out and become combative. I've always enjoyed having sexual intercourse WHILE high/drunk. I think sober sex is boring and I want nothing to do with it. BUT, I have a long term boyfriend, whom I'm in love with and want to be sexual with him. I just don't find sex fun if I'm not buzzed/drunk. I've tried doing other things, in the bedroom, to 'spice' things up. I just feel like I can't let myself relax, during sex, because I've been drunk/high during all of my sexual encounters. It's getting worse. It's scary. I know this is all over the place but I almost cheated on my boyfriend last night because of my drinking that's gotten WAY out of hand.

I have been sober since early February from alcohol and I am very proud of it. I previously had 3 years sober, but relapsed very hard last year and then again in January. I was a morning to night, mostly solo drinker and never much of a partier. I am having some confused feelings lately about my sobriety.

I have a small sober circle of friends, but in general most of my friends (including my partner) are not sober. I recently went on a trip with my partner to see my friends and got into some situations I probably shouldn't have been in. My partner essentially chain smoked weed for the entire trip, as did all of my friends. On one particular night everyone decided to drink, smoke and blow coke.

Needless to say I was shaken. I didn't want to use, but the discomfort was so immense. I felt angry and scared. I felt alienated at being the only sober one there. The only thing I could think to do was to smoke cigarettes and try to ignore it.

Honestly I don't know what to do at this point. My partner's constant smoking bothers me to no end and I don't want to dissolve my relationships with my friends over their substance use, but maybe that is the only course of action. I feel like an absolute baby when I complain about feeling alienated or articulating how uncomfortable I feel in these situations. Have you been in this position before? I am really upset about this.",8

I've never been in a long term relationship or even know how to be with a woman so there is most likely no chamce of moving out with someone I meet amd fall in love with.

I fucking worry every god damn day of dying without finding love. I feel like a broken person and unlovable to the opposite sex. I used to shoot heroin and have anxiety and depression. I find it impossible that anyone could ever love that. 

I just want to give up. Thats all i want. I dont wanna use i just feel like dying. I cant even kill myself because of how much my mom loves me. I cant do that to her. Since 17 ive always said when she dies, I die.

I don't know how to deal with the fear, and the lonliness anymore. I'm so fucking lost.

I go to meetings everyday and do my best to follow my sponsors suggestions but i cant escape the negative thoughts. I cant stay in the present day because I feel like im convinced at how im going to end up. Alone. When my mom dies ill have no one left. My sister is going to have her own family and im not close with my dad.

Im so scared i just want to know if everything will be ok but I cant know that. I am clean and i know that using doesnt hide the pain anymore. I still feel this when i use.

Im overwhelmed right now. Just need somebody to share with me they felt these things amd they are ok now.",7

I'm coming up on a year of total sobriety 2 weeks from today, and I'm still having extreme sleep issues. I sleep alright enough to feel well and energetic the next day about 2-3 nights a week, and the rest are shit. I pretty much re-live a groundhog day of being completely exhausted about every other day. My quality of life is awful.

I've tried every OTC sleep aid you can think of, and they are a night to night crapshoot whether or not they will work. If I don't take anything, I'm pretty much guaranteed a terrible night's sleep of 4-6 hours, and if I do take melatonin/valerian root/unisom, I MIGHT be able to get my much needed 7-8 hours. Even taking those though doesn't prevent often waking up at 4am and not going back to sleep the rest of the night.

During my addiction I did massive amounts of adderall and cocaine and stayed up all night hundreds of times, so I'm sure this has had some sort of impact on my circadian rhythm or something like that. That said, with 11 months and 2 weeks of sobriety under my belt, I would've thought this would be getting better by now. Honestly, it's not really even showing any signs of improvement.

When does it get better? I can't keep living like this. It's like every other day I am completely miserable and running on fumes and unable to function properly or enjoy anything.",23

Yesterday we checked in with our county substance abuse center. They referred him to the ER to manage the withdrawal. They gave him meds to bring home, Librium and Zofran. After he has 72 hours from his last drink, he’s eligible to enter their residential program. He’s at 43 hours now. 

It was his idea to start treatment. I’m incredibly proud of him. 

I’m starting Al Anon, and will bring his mother with me. Also reading a book on codependency. I know I need to work on myself so I can be a good support person for him through this. 

Mostly wondering what I can do for him over the next 72 hours to help. I know withdrawal is shitty, no way around it. But are there little things I can do to make him more comfortable and keep him chugging along? Movies? Dark room? Hydrating? Hot showers?  

Also, if you’ve been in a program, are there things your family did for you that you found helpful? Things that were unhelpful? How can I make his return home positive and supportive?

I’ll be spending the next month cleaning up whatever I can. Any stressors like unpaid bills, some work that needs done on his motorcycle, cleaning up the house, staying in contact with his family. Whatever I can find to improve so he’s not coming home to a bunch of stuff to worry about. While also making sure I’m taking care of myself and getting the help I need. 

I should mention I’m a recovering addict, almost a year out from opioid addiction. So I do have some understanding of how excruciating withdrawal is. I know the two substances are different beasts, but I at least “get it.” 


And as I’m sure it will come up, he is considering AA. 

TLDR, looking for ways to support him through his home (medicated) detox and anything else I should know.",2

I have over 3 years sober now and I have to say I absolutely love my busy, full, and beautiful life. When I got out of treatment I followed directions, got a sponsor, started working the steps, 90 in 90, I was terrified and unsure I would be able to stay sober. I got everything I could have ever wanted and more. I don't like to say ""I owe it all to AA"" because AA didn't get me out the door to those meetings and my sponsor never called me, but I do believe the program works, I've seen it work for others and it worked for me. 

These days I have a full-time internship, on top of full time senior in college, and I work one day on the weekends to try and have some gas money during the week. I have a loving family and wonderful friendships with whom I try and spend my inbetween time with. Like I said, I love my life. 

I don't like going to meetings, I think they are sort of boring and I often am exhausted. They're not completely pointless, but I have always had anxiety about sharing no matter how much or how little I have shared in meetings. the whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I'm not completely against them, I just really don't like them. Plus I'm busy. So I don't go to meetings often. I called my sponsor yesterday to ask if we could do some step work next week and she told me she didn't want to do step work with me if I wasn't going to 3 meetings a week and calling her every day, she has been my sponsor for almost two years. Honestly, I really feel like this is a ridiculous request. I literally don't have the time for that. I feel really sad/not good enough that I'm not overly enthusiastic about AA, meetings, fellowship, the Big Book, etc. I WISH I felt that way, I just don't. I also felt unsupported by her, I don't really have friends in the program and maybe that is what I was looking for. 

I just want to stay alive and have a pretty decent life without feeling like a POS for not going to enough meetings. 

Sorry I don't really know wtf this is about, I just felt like I could post here and maybe get some feedback. Has anyone ever felt like this? What happened? What did you do? What was it like?

I'm 29 and recently hit 12 months sober from alcohol. This was done purely (perhaps foolishly) on my own - my home life was at breaking point and was about to fall apart. I had no other choice but to admit to myself it had to stop.

Looking back over my 20's I can see my alcohol consumption increasing steadily. The last 2 years before I quit were really quite terrible - it's as if all the horror stories that can happen did happen.  


* I lost a job
* I gained a couple of facial scars - one from falling and putting a tooth through my lip and another across the side of my head that I don't remember happening
* I was arrested twice, one time ending up in court because I had wandered into a random house with a family watching TV and sat on their couch (yes - really)
* I woke up more than once in random locations, often outside
* Barred from all my usual hangouts
* Multiple (emphasis on multiple) sexual encounters with different people
* Ended up in a couple of fights
* *the list goes on*

Easy to understand why I had to stop!

I've not had any real difficulties stopping - I was lucky enough not to develop a physical addiction to the substance itself so could go cold turkey without any withdrawal side-effects and honestly, not to belittle anyone elses experience as this is purely my own, it was quite easy.

What I'm looking for advice on is this feeling that's been rearing it's ugly head lately - *I hate that I don't have a choice.*

A lot has happened to me this past year of being sober - as much as I try I've been unable to find a job so there's a constant gloom of worry hanging over me about my money running out. My Mother passed away in January and I was unable to cremate her until late-March due to a misdiagnosis (Huntington's Disease - which can be hereditary and added to my stress at an already painful time) that I was combating - the ward told me they wouldn't do a post-mortem out of respect to my Mum and it took me liaising with the head neurologist at the hospital to advance it - by then they couldn't run the full tests due to how long she had been dead but they did manage to rule out any of the more common neurological conditions (death certificate now states undiagnosable disorder). Both my elderly dogs were diagnosed with cancer within a month of each other - one with bone cancer in their toe and another of the bladder that has crippled me financially (even with insurance) and without a job I have no means of clawing my way out of this currently.

Yet throughout all this I've never felt the urge or need to drink. It's been a non-issue.

Now that the worst of the storm has passed from all of the above, however, I've found myself simply hating the fact that I **can't** drink if I wanted to. I simply cannot take the risk of going out with friends and just having one - I know this so emphatically that the thought of slipping and doing so terrifies me and I absolutely resent the fact with every fiber of my being.

Has anyone else had similar experiences of this? Apologies again for what turned out to be a wall of text - I've never really put anything like this out there before (and honestly the process has been quite therapeutic!) - and if you've read this far thank you!",2

I remember birthdays in college. I would see my family and feel a glimpse of joy and love - then they would head home and I would retreat to my apartment. It was in those moments that loneliness was a pleasantry, in comparison to the vast nothingness I felt my life was at that time.

No direction, no hope, and an absolute fear that I was destined to be “apart from”, forever. I had lost my path and I didn’t have a clue as to how I would find my way back - to myself.  I didn’t have a semblance of an idea who “myself” was. 

I was consumed by the destruction of my choices and the collateral damage bestowed upon my loved ones and friends. I guess with my mental state at the time, it was more-so those that loved me rather than loved ones. I had no comprehension of love. I didn’t care to understand because I felt incapable at the very core. All I knew was pain. 

The delusive point-of-view that I was “not meant to exist within this world”. So I buried that pain for years. I compromised any value’s I loosely understood and made a decision to escape every moment that I could, biding time - until, just maybe, I could find my way home. 

Eventually, love brought me home. My mom never gave up. She fought and suffered - but persevered. A sheer testament to a mother’s love for their child. 

Eventually, I found recovery. I watched from the outside for almost 4 years and marveled at the way some of these people changed their lives. My life became easier - but it wasn’t enough. 
I made a decision to wager my life once again. I made a decision to return to the hell that I had once thought long passed. Blissfully unaware, I believed that I could now finally have it both ways. 
I re-opened the metaphorical wound - only to bleed all over those that fought so hard to pull me back. 

In retrospect, the wound never fully healed. I wasn’t ready - until I was. 
Relapse, rehab - wash, rinse, and repeat. This time, however, something changed.
Through all the darkness I finally saw a glimpse of hope. In a way it reminded me of being 7 years old at the lake house, staring up into the sun with my eyes barely cracked. Cracked just enough to let a touch of light into my eyes.  

I made changes, on faith. I shut my mouth (as best I could :p) and I learned from those who have walked the path of recovery, health, and freedom. I chose friends that didn’t need or want my approval. I listened to their thoughts and feelings without comparing and contrasting experiences. I learned to listen to the inner voice. The voice that never died, it was merely drowned out for years and years by all the noise. 

Fast forward 3 fantastic birthdays, pleasant christmases, and even tragedies - that didn’t break me and so much more. Fast forward to this very moment, my 29th birthday. 

Tonight I looked around my backyard, covered in a light drizzle of rain. I saw friends that have become family. People that love me enough to come sit in a back yard covered in dog shit and pouring rain; just to celebrate my birthday. My beautiful, kind son, that chooses to love me and his best little buddy are jumping around and playing with the sticks we have yet to burn. I see joy, love, support, empathy, compassion and SO MUCH MORE in every single one of these people. My wife making sure the kids have eaten so that I can enjoy everyone’s company. She has the most warm and gentle soul - and she chooses to spend her life with me. Blessed is a sinful understatement.

Point being: I never once thought I would be raising a child by choice - and LOVE every second of it. I never thought I would see so much of myself in his words and actions, in a positive light.   I never thought I would be surrounded with friends who want to celebrate with me. I never thought I would meet a partner that I would bicker and squabble with then kiss on the forehead every night before she sleeps.
I never thought I would forgive myself.
I never thought I would be able to sit and just breathe - even for a moment.

It doesn’t matter I’ve been through. It matters how I show up when everything around me is covered in flame and ash. A conscious effort, which leads to a conscious decision to act with love and compassion. 

I’m still in disbelief.

I wrote this for myself. I wrote this for those that loved me even when I made it damn-near impossible to do so. 
I wrote this for someone that may be contemplating suicide.
I wrote this for someone that may have a son, just like me, sitting in their room getting high - believing there’s no way out.

I wrote this for my mom so that she knows I wouldn’t be here without her grit. 
I wrote this for my dad, my sister, my aunts and uncles, my grandmas, and everyone else that contributed the joy that is my life, today. 
WE made it - WE did this. 

Hey Mom. We made it out. 💙

No life is worth losing. If my story makes any bit of a difference, no matter how small, I’ll tell it. 

Trauma and pain became my gateway to truth. I found myself because I just tried. I tried my hardest, and it worked. That tells me that if you try your hardest, it can work for you too. 

Don’t give up. I’ll love you until you realize how wonderful you’ve always been. 

I couldn't have dreamed a better ending for my story - and it's only just beginning.

To my joy, my love, my wife, Coleen - thank you for taking me as I am and showing me how much love I deserve.",7

I was almost right. About a year after that, I developed an acute MRSA infection of the tricuspid valve - endocarditis. This required open heart surgery, and I almost died. It... wasn't fun. But it was exactly what had to happen, in retrospect. I was either going to die, or come so close that help would be forced on me. 

At first, I felt that such a tragedy only confirmed my worst suspicions about life - that it was painful, meaningless, and short, and that there was nothing wrong with using heroin and cocaine to wring every last bit of pleasure from it, even if it would destroy me in the process. I lasted a grand total of 6 days after spending 4 months recovering in the hospital on a heavy antibiotic regimen. 6 days until I was shooting up again.

I would be lying if I said I knew exactly what drew my back from the brink. I have some ideas, and the mostly involve love, humor, and cognitive behavioral therapy (😀), but after that initial setback, I've been completely sober for almost half a year, and I feel confident that I will make it out alive ( well, not alive, but you know what I mean).

I have to admit, it felt great to try something genuinely new. My experience in a SMART meeting was very positive. The group was run by an approved facilitator. We did a CBT exercise from the book, and I honestly felt like I was given some real tools to use. A lot of times the advise Id get when trying to get back into AA would be along the lines of pray, keep coming back, call somebody. Which is useful advice. I’m always impressed by the kindness of strangers when I go to a meeting, but that experience can be overwhelming for me. SMART was calming for me.

I am 38 years old, I have autism and live on a little disability check. I am trying to be really positive. I figure its normal to tell ones larger story that lead into the addiction on their birthday, but I do not really want to, it depresses me. When I got onto Reddit I did dump my entire life story, most of it anyway, on here 18 months ago, this is that if anyone is interested.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8mjyx5/this_is_my_story_trigger_warning/

The addiction part is fairly simple though. I never drank irresponsibly overall that was just because I did not drink too often, 1, 2 and never more than 3 times a month. I did that until I was 32. I also did not use hard drugs often, until 32 as well I had a rule I did not buy them. I came from poor people, so free drugs were not common, once every 6 months or so on average. I did anything besides opiates when they were free though, which frightened me. Then at 32 a long term friendship ended badly, the stuff from childhood came up, and I began drinking until passing out every day for 4 years.

I will spare people the normal story of how that went, I was always kind and determined not to be abusive, but I was an increasingly sad, venty person who was hard to be around, and I wrecked all my relationships, some 10 and 20 years, slowly over those 4 years. People did not have any better tools than me is the issue, they kept saying drinking was a legitimate solution and then did not know what to do when I grew worse and worse, I was always so passive and kind, ghosting was all they felt they could do in the end. I get it.

Then I jumped off a bridge, no matter what my internal feelings I had never done anything before, that is what got me into therapy and recovery. I got help from an addiction counselor, a trauma therapist, a general social worker, a mental health drop in center, and on Reddit, that was my program. I did harm reduction for 1 year, and am now sober for 1 year. I cannot express how grateful I am to the people who have helped me. I am actually feeling quite down or depressed, and do not know if that is normal on a sobriety birthday.

My people and family and such are not the most pulled together. But well half are in active addiction or so the other half are in recovery at this point, my mother has 6 years and a sister 4 years, but they do not think of things like that, so not a friend or family member remembered, not a person has phoned, and there will be no real celebration. The social worker will take me to lunch in a couple days, which is incredibly kind of him. Just feeling a bit down is all. This is really a positive and happy thing, in any larger sense I am really happy. I have trouble giving myself credit, but this is a good thing. Anyway I just thought I would share, thank you so much to anyone who reads this.",66

i've been smoking daily for about 3-3.5 years. there have been a couple months mixed in where i've tried to cut down and only smoked like 3 times per week, but i've been smoking every day for at least the past year. i got really into it because i have a lot of depression and anxiety, and i got very attached to not having to be in my own consciousness 24/7. i've always liked to be altered and i'm lucky that weed is ""all"" i ever got addicted to. i do have a full time job and am in school, so my use hasn't ruined every aspect of my life (yet), although that is mostly because again, i've just been lucky af. i've definitely done a lot of questionable things. 

i've known for a while that my use is out of control. i can do my job and kind of school but that's it, but i haven't been interested in cutting down, because i hate life anyway. for the past few years i've been high almost whenever i'm not working or studying, forgetting everything that happens while i'm high, phoning in all my relationships, just kinda waiting to die or for something to change. for whatever reason, last night i decided (again, but for the first time in a while) that it's time to make the change, so today i'm not smoking. 

i wrote down a list of all the cons of smoking weed, which i think was a good idea and i recommend it to people who are struggling with starting the process! however, i'm stuck on my next step. i don't know what to do or how to do it. 

i don't want to and really can't commit to quitting completely right now. to be honest, the idea of quitting now and never smoking again not only terrifies me but seems unnecessary. surely i can enjoy a stoned day at the beach every so often, or smoke when i'm hanging out with friends on a saturday night! also, if i feel like i can never be allowed to smoke again then i'm just gonna say f it and not do this at all. it's too much and too scary and i'm not ready to make that commitment. but i've cut down before and just gone right back. maybe i can start by taking one full week off and go from there. maybe i can have a rule where i can only smoke with people, or a certain number of times per week or month or something. or plan out my days ahead of time. i don't know. 

i also don't know where to go for support (besides here i guess). i thought about marijuana anonymous, but i don't know if that's appropriate for me.. first, they really want you to quit forever... and i also don't think the twelve step model would work for me... it absolutely works for a lot of people and i always recommend twelve step programs, but that higher power stuff is in like every step. and i know you don't have to believe in a god, but i don't believe in anything at all, and you have to believe in something powerful for the steps to even make any sense. i also worry about running into people i know. i have a therapist and will work with her on it but that might not be enough, she's not an addiction specialist or anything. 

anyway... has anyone successfully cut down significantly on their drug of choice and gotten their life back without quitting completely and without using a 12 step program? and if so what'd you do? (i do know how this sounds and have a feeling that if i get comments, at least some might say that i probably just need to quit forever. for the aforementioned reasons, i don't know that that's gonna be helpful for me right now. but if you genuinely believe that that's the only way, not just for you but for me too, feel free to let me know!) 

sorry this is so long, especially since i've never commented on anyone else's posts (..yet! i just found this sub and am new to this whole thing). thank you so much in advance for any advice/support! <3",3

My then fiance and I had a trailer in Bellflower, CA and were raising our 2 year old daughter in a house of complete chaos. Constant drug traffic, we were cooking meth, gang members and guns were a regular site at our place. The trailer was raided; dope sniffing dogs, cops in tactical gear and our daughter being snatched from our arms. Off to jail I went for the umpteenth time.  When I got out 3 months later, my fiance had left me, I lost the trailer and my daughter was in someone elses custody. Homeless, hopelessly addicted to meth (and anything else I could get my hands on) and out on the streets for a few weeks, I had finally hit bottom. 

October 15th, 1998, I made a phone call that would be the beginning of the rest of my life. I entered a 1 year live in program, and 6 months later my ex-fiance called the home, crying, asking for help. We got her into a program that day. She stayed at her program for 6 months and went to her sisters until I finished my program. We were married after I got out, and shortly after that we had full custody of our beautiful daughter again. We both had jobs, our daughter back, our family trusted us again and we were clean and sober! God and recovery were at the center of our lives!

Today, my wife and daughter and I serve in Celebrate Recovery. I'm the Ministry Leader for a wonderful CR in So Cal, my wife is on our leadership team with just over 20 years herself and our daughter runs The Landing, Celebrate Recovery for teens. She's never had a drug or alcohol problem, but CR isn't just for drugs and alcohol, but any hurt habit or hangup. God has restored my family by me putting my trust in Him and working the 12 steps of recovery. 

I'm a grateful believer in Jesus Christ, I'm in recovery for drugs and alcohol, my name is Travis. Thanks for letting me share!",171

Today is the only day I have to stay clean. So that has been my focus. Today.",82

I've been sober for over two years but in my dreams...it's a different story. 

In early recovery I'd have the same nightmare where I'd accidentally take something and realize to my horror that it was too late to go back. 

Then it progressed to having the same realization that I had accidentally broken my sobriety, but then remembering that it wasn't actually the first time, that I had done it before. 

Nowadays I don't even freak out when I do drugs in my dreams. I'm aware that I'm supposed to be sober but it's a feeling of, ""But remember dude? We agreed that weed is fine"", or ""Remember? You decided to make the exception that drinking over the holidays is still within limits"". Last night I had a feeling like, ""Hey, I've been easing up on all of these restrictions and it's been totally fine, is sobriety even something I should be making a big deal about?""

I wake up and it feels like a miracle to me that I have actually gone 763 days without a single drug or drop of alcohol. It doesn't even feel real at first. What the hell is my brain doing to me?? Does anyone have experience with getting these dreams to go away??",28

I’ve been clean since I found out I was pregnant (2.5 years). He’s now at an IP BH facility and I’m wrecked. 


How can I be supportive of his recovery while also watching out for our child? I don’t know how I can ever trust him again, how can I trust him to keep clean around our child? I haven’t spoken to him since I found out he was admitted—I’m scared I will say something I’m going to regret, but I’m also angry. This is his 4th time being hospitalized since we started dating, he’s been in rehab twice and IP twice. 

He’s been calling me daily since he’s been IP, how can I effectively talk to him without impeding his recovery. I want to tell him it’s over between us, and if it was only me I feel like I could try and make it work, but now I have to think about our child and what’s best for little one.",15

One of my biggest issues  was downtime and boredom outside of a marriage that im still stuck in but due to a unique situation im able to be away from home which heavily aided in my recovery.  So here is a small list of things that have helped me and sorry if this is all out of order not to good at putting the thoughts in writing. So first things first a hobby absolutely find a hobby I took up drones started off with a 90 dollar drone from Target and decided I really liked it that set the path to a sort of money pit im now 5 drones in but got one for the long term now so will stop pouring money into that. 2. Drone got put up for the summer as triple digits and lipo batteries dont get along thus I discovered drag racing at the Tucson Dragway a nice man at the window my first time there asked if I was there to race or to watch didnt even know that was an option at the time so I watched the first time and the next event that came up I ran in my car is not fast yet but fell in love with the feeling and it has become somewhat of a money pit now as well lol but it was the first thing I found that doesnt require drinking on a Saturday and that you can stay out past Midnight doing and meet some really awesome people have yet to win a race but its all for fun anyway and leaves me plenty to research afterwards for my next upgrade. 3.) Started a youtube channel for all my drone footage which im still in the process of getting better at but editing video is a pretty hefty project also one thing I failed to mention much maintenance comes after flying for an hour putting batteries into storage voltage reviewing video etc. 4.) Start a facebook page for something your passionate about that can potentially help others mine was for doing mods and upgrades to naturally aspirated Mazda 3s once you get going youll find it to be very time consuming and will keep you busy. 5.) Get a calendar and make a schedule for everything not sure if its my current medication for arthritis or my thyroid or the years and years of drinking but I cant remember sh\*t anymore so I literally write down everything. 6.) Develop a new routine or find ways to alter the old ones I used to drink heavily when watching college football I still watch college football but replaced beer with La Croixs sparkling water I buy all the flavors and alternate through the day to keep the flavor going or I drink coffee. 7.) For people in Tucson who need a place to go thats open til midnight and has great coffee check out Black Crown Coffee on Speedway this place is awesome. I hope this helps someone feel free to message me if thats available on here still kinda learning reddit lol.,7

2019-10-01 22:41:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/dc47q9/12_step_wisdom_and_thoughts/,12 step wisdom and thoughts,"Hey all.

Over the last 20 years I have had many extensive experiences with recovery, and as you know you only get the good after all the bad. Recovery today (especially in the USA) is still so heavily biased towards 12 step programs despite the growing field of addiction science that it is staggering to me that we pay anywhere from 3k to 50k for rehabilitation programs that essentially are 24/7 12 step meetings. While not currently active within the rooms of my city I can safely say I have been around the block... several times... which when added up would likely be a marathon amount, for all sorts of substance and behavioral concerns.

I do lurk in some recovery subs though and at times get pulled in. Rarely do I write a freaking essay though, but that is what happened today. In a week old thread on top of it, and have no idea if anyone will ever see it. I do think there is good info there, for those new or struggling with the 12 steps and some of the ideas floating through those rooms. If you would like, you can continue below where I have copied the text. Please consider that I am a humbled man and by no means do I claim that I am an expert beyond my life experiences and self education into the matters at hand.

TL/DR:
Copied a post I wrote to a newcomer in recovery from his gambling problem. May be useful for you or others.

A note before the wall of text:
I believe addiction is a behavioral issue, that stems from continually reinforcing problematic behaviors in our brain. I strongly argue against ""once an addict always an addict"", because I believe that if our behaviors have changed over time the pathways we have created in our brain erode, change, go away or are no longer dominate. My post below came in response to that message hitting home with with this individual, who then expressed other concerns regarding 12 step programs.",1
