So I accidentally pissed off this guy I’m living with. I was like “please don’t start shit” and he started saying I’m the one who started shit. I started having a panic attack and left the place to buy some cigarettes(was literally 1 day off them and was trying to quit so damn bad). Then after the smoke it kinda set my head straight but then I grabbed a screw driver and hid it in my jacket in case he decided to fuck with me. I’m laying in bed now and starting to realize this ain’t normal behavior. I’m wondering if I got ptsd or some shit. I’ve been choked unconscious before and beaten up and the idea of someone doing it to me makes me extremely hostile. Also I’m  17 days off Kratom but many many months off speed. And 3 days off weed. And just because you take away the drugs doesn’t mean your mind is automatically cured. I still remember what happened. I can’t afford counseling or a therapist as of rn but I might in about a month or so. Any advice until then? Because its been effecting my daily life since I was a kid.

Most of my best friends are from meetings or rehabs and a good chunk of them are still/again getting high. They're such amazing people and they don't pressure me into picking up on purpose but it ends up going that way all the time.

Worse yet I've been one foot in one foot out fir a long time and a lot of my friends are the same way. We'll both have a couple weeks or a couple months and we get together and somebody jokes about picking up and then it's not a joke anymore. Last time my homie joked about smoking some crack so we picked up a 20, next thing you know I'm kicked out of my SLE and I pick up crystal (my DOC) on the way over.

A good half the time I'm either the one who starts the joke or makes it happen or both and I respect people who've cut me off for that reason even though it hurts. But I've also had so many people reach out and help when I'm unsure of my recovery that it's really hard to tell people I can't hang out because they're not serious enough or I don't want to talk on the phone until they're at least trying to get clean without feeling like I'm betraying them and by proxy myself when I'm in that position.

 I'm starting to understand the importance of the ""stay in the middle of the herd"" concept. I tell myself I'm going to set boundaries next time someone hits me up but they're just such fucking decent people even when they're using that the words don't come out of my mouth. I'm sure sometimes it's about subconsciously keeping the option open but sometimes it's just about wanting to stay close with people I love no matter what. Being a good friend to people who have supported me is really, really important to me and I just don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice that trait in favor of my own safety and well-being. And yet I know where it leads, and unlike some of my friends I'm not always capable of being a good friend when I'm getting high...

I’m a 26 year old woman who just got dumped out of the blue by a 30 year old woman. She said it had nothing to do with me, and that she just “wasn’t feeling it anymore”. This came out of nowhere as we had literally just been talking about our future together. We were about to buy one plane tickets to Europe, we were planning on buying a house, ect. People close to both of us have reached out to say that they’re equally as confused as I am by this because it came from nowhere.

So now my life is in a state of disarray. There were no warning signed and now I have to rewrite my future without her in it. I’ve been through break ups before, but honestly never felt that anyone loved me like she did. For the first time in my life, I felt loved. 

And now all I want to do is throw away my clean time and use because I can’t stop crying, I can’t do anything, and all I can do is feel this horrible pain in my chest all day every day. I would kill to numb this pain.

I work at a treatment facility so my job entirely depends on my clean time. I am in school (finals week too) and I was doing really well up until this point. And now I want to relapse because what’s the ducking point anymore? I’ve never felt this level of pain before. I just want it all to go away.",28

I've been so effing sexually frustrated/disappointed  in my marriage that it's been unbearable and just so sad. Could use some practical advice. Also I appreciate spiritual advice and love the 12 steps. 

I'm wondering if I've been switching addictions. 
Does anyone have experience with sexual addiction? 

 I've been clean off hard drugs for 12 years. Picked up a bad masturbation habit for 2 of those years on meth n addy. Got clean, Did no fap for 4 years. Got married. The sex was pretty awesome at first because we really love each other and were so excited to be doing life together. 

Once we had kids we were so tired our sex turned into quickies all the time. I'm pretty sure she has a hormone deficiency. She wont really see the doctor I have to do everything. 

Now I totally regret having quickies. And I fuxking hate our sex life. Everything rests on me. She just lies there. She claims she really likes sex and she moans pretty hard and ever once in a while squirts and says she really enjoys it. But . I've begged her to just do anything sexual. Give me a dance, put on a skirt. Do some foreplay. Honestly any God dam thing she would do I would be totally happy with.

 I would like it way more  often
 But honestly if it was really good I might not need it that much. 
. I want to see her face. I want to see her being attracted to me. I want to see her aroused and try to arouse me. How it was earlier. This is disappointing as fuck. I can't even hardly sleep in the same room with her because it's just fucking sad.

What have I done to help: Say alot of nice things, sweet notes, take her on dates, watch the kids, fix/clean the house, give her alot of space..I could do more but I'm fucking exhausted from it. It doesnt get anywhere. But I am happy to make her happy and she is getting stronger and happier I think. Also I used to come on to her and romance her and touch her alot. Now it just makes me sad so one sided so I backed off. 

So I love my wife and want to serve her and be there for her as best I can. I think she has hormone deficiencies. I could be more vocal about this but I feel like I've already said too much and Im worn out from trying. 

Weve been married 7 years  and kids for 5. That was rough but massive joy. We're just grinding it out in expensive California pretty broke and working alot and raising our kids. So I want to be nice because she's delt with alot of shame and insecurities. 

I think the problem is when I'm stressed I want to have more sex. I see it as a pleasant distraction . Especially if I'm trying not to drink. But she wouldn't care if we had sex a few times a year.",6

Within a couple months, I was trying to quit. I could make it a couple days sometimes. Other times, a week or so. In nine months, unable to abstain, I told my husband. It was so hard. He had so many ideas about addiction that weren't based on medical science but rather were based on the moralism that people with substance use disorders have been dealing with since our suffering began.

I am blessed. My husband read the research I shared with him. He was skeptical but grew to be supportive. I got involved in advocating for changes in drug policy and more access to treatment. Then I relapsed again after a few months. But the advocacy was so important to me. Even high on meth, I showed up. Then someone called me a leader in the recovery movement and I knew I had to find a way to make recovery stick.

I made plans to quit again at the beginning of September, 2019. I told my husband about my new relapse and that I was going off to the woods to detox (because fuck fluorescent lighting). I came back and my final year of school began. It was so different. Being off meth, I could show up 100% for my classes and my clients. Every day felt like such a blessing. Still, the cravings were terrible. Some tv show I was watching suddenly had someone smoking a meth pipe and I was pulling out my phone to find where the party was at. Thank God I was too drunk to drive.

Everything changed in November. I had been out at a bar and I met someone who was talking about psychedelic mushrooms. I'd been trying really hard to do things that could heal my brain damage but I was constantly finding myself pressing up against places where I used to have capacity and I just didn't anymore. I had read that psilocybin could potentially help with neurogenesis. So I bought some and I did a mushroom trip with a dear friend. The next day, I woke up without nicotine cravings. I haven't had a craving for nicotine or used nicotine since that next day. The next time I saw someone using meth on TV, I felt nothing.

The mushrooms made it so clear. I am so happy today. Meth made me unhappy. I prefer being happy to unhappy. I have no interest in ever doing the drugs that made me unhappy ever again.

Now I try to do mushrooms once a month. It helped me quit nicotine, stopped my meth cravings, changed my relationship with food and alcohol, made me love my job and broke me out of post-acute withdrawal depression. Psilocybin may be the best thing that ever happened to me. Imagine being lost in the darkness for so long and then suddenly someone turns on the lights and the scary things aren't anymore. You can see what you're doing and where you are going. I am so blessed and there's nothing I want to do more than help others who are lost in the dark turn on the lights and find their way home.",5

His specific problems include the following: at least two years of regular benzodiazepine and alcohol use, occasional other drugs including opiates and ketamine, a general anxiety and ADHD diagnosis, and a lot of past emotional trauma. He reached out clearly looking for help, but has overdosed on benzos and other drugs and taken himself to the hospital twice in the last 24 hours. Though at moments he wants to pursue a detox and rehab, at other moments he’s angry and afraid about what the future holds, and that combined with withdrawal and addiction pushes him back to using. He lives out of state, so I’m only currently able to help him remotely. He’s in his late 20s, and has struggled with addiction on and off for about a decade. He had a very strained relationship with his parents, but they’ve indicated that he’s been at a hospital to treat overdose repeatedly over the last two years.

A) this isnt an NA meeting, B) most people at meetings dont glorify and express how badly they want to get high, sure it happens sometimes but for the most part it is about the steps and the solution. And this guy does this. every. single. week. I tried to respond  like this, along these lines but what is the point? You cant talk sense into stupid, just like you cant talk an addict if they truly want to use. I am so close to telling him to shut the fuck up you dry drunk slum lord piece of shit.

hey all.  i'm sooo close to a year sober :) -- but i've been out of work for about 6 weeks now and things are starting to look very bleak in terms of money and opportunities.  i've been on the hunt for jobs and it's bringing up all sorts of issues for me.

most notably is that my resume is full of holes.  i've been fired from pretty much every job i've ever had due to my alcoholism.  there are months long gaps from when i was either deep in active addiction or trying to get sober.  i'm not confident in what any reference from these jobs might say about me.  i currently have one former boss (who is 30 yrs sober, and gets it), and 2 friends (one owns a restaurant, the other is the head of HR at a big company) as my references.

also my work experience consists almost entirely of kitchen work, i am a chef by trade.  as much as i love it, it is just physically too much for me nowadays.  also, not a great environment for continued sobriety due to the hours, stress, drinking culture, etc.  and since i live in a medium sized city, i definitely have a reputation for being unreliable after all these years of fucking up.  plus i'm embarrassed as fuck.  so jobs in the restaurant industry are hard to come by.

anyone have any advice for how to handle this situation?  tips to improve my resume, career fields that might be good options (i have some college education but no degree), or even just a pep talk on how you got through it yourself.  thanks in advance, this has been a really rough time.",7

Five years ago today, I stumbled into the rooms 

And today I am writing to express my gratitude 

My life is evidence that miracles are possible

&#x200B;

In 2015 I was 21 years old and I had had enough

Of bipolar disorder, resentment and vomit

Of broken glass, ashes and loneliness 

But lacking courage to end my life

&#x200B;

So I made my first meeting, took the first step and set fire to my old self. 

&#x200B;

Over the last few years the time spent in these rooms has taught me:

* When uncomfortable or stressed blank –Be patient. **Comfortable silence** **resides within**.
* When failing or controlling – Accept. **Let go**. **Or you will be dragged. Friction burns.**
* When self-centered – Humility. Every time. **Always be kind. No exceptions.**
* When the path feels hard, tread lightly. **If it’s not effortless, it’s not right.** 

With discipline, I have been given the courage to rebuild my life with intention

And in exchange for faith, I have been granted an existence of belonging and serenity

&#x200B;

Brothers and sisters, from love we come and to love we shall return 

Blessed is each fighter that has passed and each still to come

That no addict seeking recovery should ever die

&#x200B;

It's not the first thing I want to talk about when I meet someone. My past is really messy and could be interpreted as a major red flag. I'm embarrassed to some degree of the choices I've made.

I've been sober for just over two and a half years. My drug of choice was weed but I had occasional issues with drinking more than I wanted to.   


Through my recovery I've come to appreciate how little my addiction has had to do with the substances themselves. I've been an addict because of chronic anxiety and patterns of avoidance. I continue to see this play out with screens: my phone, TV, video games, surfing the internet, etc. I will spend more time than I want to tuned out of the world because the thought of doing what I *actually* want to do (clean my room, study for a test, folding laundry, meditate) is unpleasant and overwhelming.  


The thing is though, my recovery has been very spiritual and based in a practice of mindfulness and acceptance. Through accepting, for example, that I went longer than I wanted to without cleaning my room *and that's ok*, I've been able to shed a lot of the negative self talk (""You're lazy"", ""Your life is a mess"", ""You're never going to amount to anything"", etc) that made facing the less-than-pleasant things in life such an overwhelming and anxiety riddled process.  


Without going into too much detail, my life has changed around quite a bit since I stopped using substances. I feel like I'm in a really good place, and next month I'm going to be submitting an application to grad school. Lately I've been feeling like I could go back to using substances if I wanted to and be ok. Why would I want to? Because despite how much trouble they've caused me, substances have also enriched my life in various ways. Psychedelics have been a huge spiritual tool for me in the past (and made me confront the fact that I needed to stop using for a while). Weed is a very social substance, and I would enjoy being able to connect with certain people in my life in that way again. And I wouldn't mind making a nice boeuf bourguignon and relaxing with a nice glass of red as I sit down to dinner.  


In my mind, substances are no longer any more of an issue than internet usage. They're something that's potentially harmful to me but that means that I need to remain mindful about how I'm using them and the impact they're having on me. So right now my plan is to start grad school in the fall (about 6 months from now), graduate after another two years, and then seriously check in with myself about my relationship to sobriety. All the while I'll be continuing my recovery and working on the patterns of avoidance in my life.  


I'm wondering if anyone can relate to any of this, and/or if people know of anyone who's approached recovery in this way.",8
2020-02-11 17:37:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/f2ghw1/leaving_aa/,Leaving AA,"Hi guys,  


Firstly, thank you for reading this :)  


I am sober 1.3 years, got sober at the age of 24 from alcohol, weed and other drugs. Was a huge mess ( surprise) when started my recovery process.  


I got sober in AA, I live in a country where there are no other offline support groups available, I am really starting to understand that AA program is not for me, I am terrified because for the last year my life was heavily centred around it and I do believe that the reason AA worked for me was the incredible and loving support I got from the fellowship. I came to AA where I was at a stage of not caring where to go, very broken. And for the most of first year my mind was elsewhere, I did not really analyse the program, in fact I believed it's better not to, AA will only work if you believe in it and I unfortunately can't hide from myself anymore that I do not believe in some higher power participating in my life on the level of mundane, everyday activities and also do not think that mindset of ""powerlessness"" is the way i want to build my life.  


In a nutshell, I believe the social aspect of recovery community is crucial for my sobriety, and I also very much appreciated the recovery principles of AA - subtracting the God stuff- which I summarised to the principal ""Don't be a selfish \*\*\*\*\*\*\*"" for myself. I thought I will go to meetings and try to ignore the higher power stuff - but it's getting increasingly difficult and feels hypocritical.  


I would appreciate to hear your experience and stories of leaving AA and  tips for staying sober .  I also feel like the insistence of AA members that AA is the only way to stay sober is unhealthy and rigorously overemphasised to be true.",46

Last night i spent hours feverishly carpet surfing, to no avail, of course. I feel like a fool. My blood pressure seems to be remaining low, better when I'm laying down, standing is the worst. I'm dizzy all the time, struggling not to dissociate as all the bad feelings come rushing back. PTSD, hello my old friend. I despise these memories. How silly that once, they were my solitude, forever reminding me of my strength. Now they just seep in like the plague, reminding me of how weak I was to give in. 

I weighed myself on day 2, back down to 105 pounds. I had been doing so well, 116! But I lost it all in those few weeks, shouldn't be surprised. Now I can hardly eat without the urge to vomit. Food has no taste, just bland, foreign mush in my mouth. I force myself to eat anyways, I cannot regain strength from vapor anymore.... 
Day 3 i had parent teacher conferences, i should have been so happy for my kids, they've been doing so well. But i could hardly muster a smile. What kind of mother am i?

I started drinking at 14. First time I got drunk i ended up in the hospital 3x over the legal limit but luckily didn’t need my stomach pumped. (I was chubby lol)

First time I started dabbling in pills (benzos,  amphetamines, and opiates) I was 17. I started off with Klonopins. Fell in love.  My cousin got prescribed Ativan and she’d always sell them so I started taking them frequently. Used adderal for no reason at first until I realized how clean my room/house was when taking them lol, I started on opiates when I sprained my ankle and they gave me Vicodin. 

**Here is where my life turned into complete shit** 

I started shooting coke when I was 22 (I’m 24) after my father passed away due to suicide. I had been on that slippery slope since drinking all the time at 17. Then I completely fell off because I was doing coke **a lot** since I was I think 20? Nobody knew I was shooting up. *nobody*. Not even my live in boyfriend. Around that time we were dating 7 years and had fell out of love and had complete opposite work schedules so we barley saw each other even though we lived in our own apartment. Anyway, when we got that apartment is when I started drinking a lot again after slowing down almost completely. (I’ve been an alcoholic since 18/19) 

My troubles really began when I left my then boyfriend in 2018. I was shooting coke but it was every weekend or sometimes every other. We had other issues unrelated to my drugs use and so I left him. I even quit my job. &amp; I’m not proud of this and I’ve apologized and paid him back recently.. buuuut when I left him (he was working) I took all his money, his weed, grabbed some of my clothes, and left. **To clarify:** that was the first and only time I have ever stolen from anybody I’m close to  like that. I’m not an asshole so I don’t rip people off. I just wasn’t in the right state of mind. I was up all night on adderal (I worked full time overnights at that time) and I have a breakdown. But the break up was better for both of us. That’s 1 good thing my addiction did for me. 

I was sober after that for 3-4 months and I was with my now boyfriend. he was sober and he helped me get off all that shit. And then I ended up assisting in his relapse. Once again, not proud at all. 

We started using once every couple months, to once a month, to once a week, to days binges. It all escalated so fast.. I couldn’t stop it (I could have but I was so fucked I didn’t realize how bad I was getting)

**Now here is the worst of my addiction**

It was beginning of last year, 2019 until recently. I started using more and more, and then going on week binges sometimes. I was living with my boyfriend (also an addict and now sober again) outside of Boston. Now, if anybody has ever here of [“Methadone Mile”](https://www3.bostonglobe.com/news/bigpicture/2016/07/16/boston-methadone-mile/cLqxOAY7X9tHiooOGuATAI/story.html?arc404=true) you know where this story is heading. If not, click the link and it’ll tell you all about it. 

If you’re to lazy I’ll summarize it. It’s the Boston, MA. Well Roxbury to be specific. It’s the  “skid row” of Massachusetts. It’s literally a mile of methadone clinics and shelters. There was South Hampton st Shelter. It is **NOT** a good place at all. It’s extremely dangerous. It was a little stretch of road  and that’s where all the drug addicts hung out. You could get **anything**. It was a lawless part of Boston. (As long as there’s no violence) people literally walk up and down the strip yelling “GOT THAT BROWN” “GOT THAT GREASE!” (Grease= potent crack) or you could just walk yourself and yell out “I NEED XYZ”. (Methadone Mile is no more due to the cops “clean sweep” mission after a correctional officer got assaulted on his way to work in the jail that’s it literally 50 ft from south Hampton shelter. I actually saw it and I’m even on the camera footage) Again, **NOT** proud.

Anyway, we started hanging out down there. Shooting coke, meth, herion, crack. Anything we could get our hands on. We were a fucking mess. That lasted the entire summer. We were worn down. Looked like shit. The only advantage we had was his father allowed us to stay there. If not, I guarantee we would have stayed out there. 

So me and my boyfriend became long distance in August. (He’s in prison for violation of probation, he’s now sober too) since then, I slowed down using. I was using every few weeks (unknown to him)  

Then I stopped shooting it and starting smoking coke. Notice the little progress? 

Well. I **FINALLY* stopped since New Years. On New Years, I did *one* line and said to myself “you know what? No. This ends now” and I left the party.  I haven’t touched it since. I know it doesn’t seem like a long time but the amount of good things that have been happening to me.. I’m proud of myself for doing it so long. 

Edit: I even had my cousins boyfriend doing coke right in front of me and offered me. **I declined!**

**Here are some good things that have happened since I’ve stopped using:**

1. I got a job after being unemployed for over a year. (Longest I’ve ever been unemployed) and I actually love my job. 
2. I’ve rekindled my relationship with my mother
3. I’m no longer too fucked up and worrying about my next high that I can help my mom with my 2 younger sisters (5 &amp; 14) 
4. My hair is healthy and my skin is clear. 
5. I’m just overall happier.
6.  I can keep money in my pocket 
7. I’m earning people’s trust back
8. I don’t turn to drugs as soon as something upsets me 
9. I’m just a much better person after all.

Okay, bear with me because this might get a little long. 

My husband (35m) and I (34f) are high school sweethearts. We have been together for almost 20 years, married for 5 of those. We had always gotten high together but after I had my first daughter our drug use got out of control and we both ended up having a raging addiction to oxy’s and heroin. I got clean about 7 years ago, he got clean a few months after I did. I got on the suboxone program and after months of him taking mine I told him he had to get himself on the program or that was it. Things have been awesome since we got on the program, we both have good jobs, drive nice cars, own our home, and I recently went back to school to pursue my substance abuse counselor license. 

Things changed back in may though. My husband decided he didn’t want to take suboxone anymore, so he went through a detox and got off of it. He did great for the first two months, and then I think the never-ending lethargy and lack of motivation started to get to him. He started drinking every day. After a month of that I put my foot down and told him I would not stay married to an alcoholic. We have had so many arguments, I just can’t take it any more. I have so many dreams of using now and my stress level is at a constant 100%. He stopped drinking during the week, but once he starts drinking on Friday afternoon he doesn’t stop until late Sunday night. When he has a long weekend off or any day off, he spends it drinking. I took him to a concert a couple weeks ago for his birthday, and he drank Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, took Tuesday-Thursday off, and started drinking on Friday again. He tells me he doesn’t have a problem because he only drinks on the weekends. I am at a loss. I have told him that I can’t be with him if he chooses to continue, (my dad and brother are alcoholics, I lost my dad to drinking and driving when I was 12 so alcohol is the one thing I can’t tolerate). Even though I am going to school for this, I’m having a hard time dealing with it in my own life. Our daughters are 9 and 13 and they love their father dearly, which complicates things. I’ve tried being supportive, I’ve tried being firm, nothing gets through to him. My patience has run out though and he knows I am at the end of my rope but he still does it. I just want to know what other people think and what they would do, some outside perspective might help me make a decision.",2

I have been so proud of myself this last week, tapering my doses and sticking to my schedule. I don't know why I thought this would help ease my detox, it hasn't. After my last dose yesterday morning, I slept for hours, all I dreamt of was redosing. I woke up to a phone call, to the sound of your voice, you are forever keeping me grounded. I blocked my plugs number with shaky hands and slowly drifted back off into my numb slumber. 

This morning, when I opened my eyes, I felt my body starting to react to the absence of the poison. My blood pressure crashed, my body temperature is the lowest I've ever seen it, my once beautiful face now pale with sharp cheekbones and shadowed eyes, my lips are cracked and bleeding, a sharp pain in my stomach, a darkness in my mind... How foolish I was to be hopeful that the inevitable could be avoided this time. Now I shake as my skin crawls, every vein begging for a taste of that poison, my lover, for she is my only cure.

Asleep again, plagued with memories of using. How it felt, all those months ago, to feel it for the first time... How it used to make me dance, how it made me feel like I was super woman, how I became the world's most productive worker and mother. But when I opened my eyes, moments later, I am reminded of the damage I have caused... 

I called the kids in sick from school today, claiming the family had all come down with the flu. The reality is I couldn't drive them safely, fuck I couldn't even stand. We're all in the living room, I'm letting them watch TV and tell them mommies sick so they need to be good to me today. My 9 year old feeds his little brother breakfast, and he leaves me a poptart next to my chair. These boys, I have failed them... 

I know I could have it much worse, that my life isn't as bad as many of those before me. I have been an expert at hiding, well, mostly... But, in retrospect, I could have failed more, despite feeling I've been the worst. No jail time, no institution, no social workers at my door, no suspecting teachers or coworkers or friends.... I tell myself it could be much worse, I still have something left to rebuild. None of those thoughts stop me from the guilt, none of those thoughts can ease the crushing weight of the things I've done. 

How did this begin you ask? It's been a life long affair really. I started out as a foster kid, knowing exactly how to handle that first baggie, knowing damn well what it does to people, having seen it and lived it, but I didnt care, I was so numb and dead inside, and in actuality, no one would even care. So it was then I met the love of my life, her poison washed over me, making me feel like the first time I was truely alive. She gave me confidence, she allowed me to survive, she got me through the years of abuse and unwanted touches, she kept me firm on my journey and eyes set ahead on my goals. 

Years later I was adopted by a wealthy family. They had horses, even bought one just for me. It was a dream come true, everything I had ever wanted. They loved me as if they made me, even though by that time i was already 14. I remember the first time I quit, mom thought I had the flu, she stayed home from work and took care of me. My body bounced back quickly, back to school i went.. No one ever knew back then, by that time the substance was such a constant in my life that no one had even seen me sober. Straight a student, president of my 4H club, captain of the swim team... But now they all knew something was off, i wasnt myself... I began to lose friends, i withdrew, i dropped out of the swim team, and i asked my mom if i could go to school online instead. I got sober for the first time at 16, but it didnt last long. I went right back to the only love I've ever known, and she was there to welcome me. This time was different, she didnt treat me like she did before... 

Maybe I had chaged? Maybe because I was no longer using for the sense of survival? In either case she brought hell... At 17 my parents forced me into a rehab program, their disappointment was immeasurable. They didn't understand what happened, why I did this, why I ""changed"". They could never understand that all I was trying to do was be myself! I finished highschool online, somehow still managing a 4.0. I graduated early, top 3 of my class, and with honors, that's about every thing I accomplished in rehab. Still, I was able to find my footing and decide I wanted to live without my love. 

And I did! For 12 long years, I lived my life of sobriety. I went the college. At 19 I bought a house. By 20 I met the man of my dreams. Years passed and he became abusive, we had two kids, and I left him at 24 after his abuse shifted to the boys, for I knew I was a strong woman, and I would give my children the childhood I never had. Fast forward, he dipped state,I struggled to support two kids financially but I managed. Met another man, we dated two years, split on mutual terms, he's still my friend, just texted this morning acutally. And then I met *her* and my entire world shifted. My heart stopped the moment our eyes met, and from that point forward it's like it beat only for her. And to this day, it still does. 

... Looking back I dont know how I got to where I am now. Things just slowly fell to pieces. I lost focus, I gave too much maybe, and then I gave in. 

Idk. I'm going to cry again. I should shower, I feel so gross. Maybe I'll write more later.",8

I am looking at very likely switching from Subutex tablets to the sublocade shot. My insurance has already approved it, and my doctor has agreed to let me switch. I’ve been stable on subutex for 4 years and I’m so ready to step off. 
My goal is to start the shot, and then after three months of being on it I am going to allow myself to taper off. Well, it won’t be a traditional taper, but the shot apparently leaves the system so slowly that weaning isn’t as bad as you would think. W/d symptoms are bearable, according to the few I’ve spoken to who have gone through it.  So, I’m trying to gain some insight from those who are either on it or have been on Sublocade. I understand that it is still relatively new, and many do not yet have access to it. This is a shot in the dark, for sure.

I wasn't sure I belonged here because I'd only been using for a handful of years, I'd never been arrested, and I'd never been to jail. Eventually I learned that in my head, I'm just as sick as the rest of y'all in the rooms. Once I came to that realization, it was easier for me to get focused on my program and make the steps work for me. It's been a wild journey, but I wouldn't change it for the world.

I noticed on our first date that he could put away hard liquor without flinching, 3yrs ago. We moved back near his hometown for a job promotion just over 2 yrs ago and the life transition just went terribly. I have lived with partners before, he hasnt. I went beyond broke unable to find work, and his finances just werent organized to cover. This combined with old toxic friends, arrested interpersonal skills, and dysfunctional family history led to unmanaged stress, more drinking and here we are. None of it was done on purpose, it was chaos that seems to make sense now that we know where much of it has come from. 

He is not abusive, he is distant. He doesnt party in bars or have the trigger of seeing other people drink, he drinks alone at home after work. He realized he was an alcoholic in Sept 2019, and started his outpatient program this week. We have went thru spells before of almost splitting up, no sex, distance, leading up to realizing that addiction is the center of the problems we've faced. 

What can I do to support him and connect with him, without smothering him during his program? I was looking forward to having a few evenings off of work (I am a waitress) to spend time with him and it's very eerily quiet here at home. He hasnt had a drink in 3 days and I can tell he's adjusting. I have no idea what going on in his mind, I dont want to smother. He is subdued, distant and feels cold. He came home from his meeting last night almost in tears and didnt say much. I hug him and tell him I'm proud of him. I make us tea and fold his laundry. 

His program is 3 nights a week, they want more but wprk with him because his work schedule is demanding. I hope to adjust my schedule to be home at night more. I just dont know what to do to help keep it together. I DO and WILL continue to make a point to take care of me even though I hate where we live. 

But if I'm being honest I'm not sure if we will make it. I'm not sure if he is capable of showing up emotionally in the ways I need in order to build a life together. I currently feel like there may not be room for me. I hope on the other side of rehab the man I met is still in there for me and us, but I also wonder if he even knows who that person is inside. 

I dont want to give up on us, but I want to feel loved and wanted too. 

I guess what I am asking is, in hindsight for those of you who have been thru alcohol rehab, what did YOU need when you were in that space? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks in advance, yall are rockstars.",17

I'm in my mid-forties, and have been a functioning addict 4 all of my life. I drank heavily and indulged in anything I could get my hands on until I was in my mid-20s, starting around 14. In my early twenties I developed a love for speed, as a result of the circles that I ran in, mainly cocaine. I've always beenable 2 maintain a job, and my relationships usually allowed for me to sell to other users, that I might get my own Supply relatively inexpensively.
By my early thirties, through seemingly endless struggle, I was able to stop using everything but pot. With the current attitude surrounding marijuana, I feel silly even posting this. I don't feel the problem is with marijuana itself, but it has everything to do with my attitudes and the way that I think.
 I'm simply an addict.
Regardless of what it is that I feel is providing me with my happy space, I go ahead at 110%... and then figure out how to push the envelope further. My life has been littered with behaviors that I had to cut out completely because I couldn't figure out how to participate in a healthy moderate manner.
My days are the same as they've always been, I wake up 5 in the morning start smoking, work out, smoke, head to work where I proceed to smoke 4 to 5 times throughout my work day, before heading home to wash rinse and repeat. I should share that this is absolutely Anon acceptable behavior in my workplace. I would instantly lose my job, which is subject to drug testing, if my usage were discovered. I have a wonderful wife who at most drinks a few glasses of wine throughout the course of a year, and I feel like she deserves somebody stronger.
The deal is, after everything else that I done, herb just seems so not dangerous. I feel like I've learned things from it, but I also feel like I'm ready to move on. There's nothing about the substance that I feel is problematic, rather the problem resides within my head. The problem resides in trying to stay as high as I can all day, because that helps to keep my mind from searching for other things, and it scares me a bit.
I had overdosed a couple of times as a teenager, and I have been through several faith-based recovery programs, but my faith has become very personal, and no longer aligns with the recovery programs of which I am aware.
Are there recovery programs for people who are simply addicts? I think it's more of the adrenaline and escape-probably just the escape-that I am addicted to. I've been in counseling for almost a year now, and while it has shed some light on some of the issues in my past and I am working through that, I don't feel like we're making any progress on my issues with being sober.
Anyone out there with similar histories, or suggestions?

I mean there are innumerable gifts in sobriety, FROM sobriety, but one thing I still can’t help but hate is when I feel weird. I hate feeling unusual, different, like I can’t participate just because I’m sober. I mean, I got sober SO I COULD participate in life. But there are still things, times, events, where drinking is so woven into the fabric of it, that I can’t help but feel like an outsider.

The super bowl is basically the best example of this for me. 

This year will be my second super bowl sober — I got clean 5/13/2018. I love football, but more than that, I love to get together with people and drink. Even if everyone else was on beer #2, while I was using the last swallow of beer #7 to wash down some oxy in the bathroom before picking up #8. Even if I didn’t know the people that well, or didn’t care about the teams playing. Even if I didn’t especially like the people I was with. It was a day out of the year that I looked forward to, that I felt like I could day-drink in good company and feel good about it. 

The super bowl comes every year, and now I’m clean. I normally feel good, satisfied with my life decisions, but during the super bowl I kinda fall back into feeling weird. But just like super bowl Sunday comes every year, so does Monday. Whether I like it or not. And now I get to wake up on Monday without any embarrassments or regrets. I might be a little afraid people at work will ask me what I did, and I’ll have to admit I just went to the gym then watched it at home with my wife. But at least I don’t have to wake up wondering how I got here, or when I fell asleep, or what I did or said, or what embarrassing place I threw up. 

Today is super bowl Sunday. Since I got clean, I got my private pilot license, and I’m working on my instrument rating. Tomorrow morning, I am meeting my instructor at 4:30am for a flight lesson, to prepare for my checkride that’s scheduled in about 5 weeks. I try not to bitch and moan about my sobriety because truthfully, I get to do things today that I never would have even DREAMED of when I was using. And while I still haven’t totally figured out how to be comfortable in large groups of people without drinking, or how to participate in these big American holidays like the super bowl or 4th of July... I’m deeply appreciative of what I DO have. I have a life now where I get to push myself, where I get to line up difficult challenges and then work really hard to achieve them without colossally fucking up. My wife is pregnant, and now I get to be that dude in a meeting talking about how grateful I am that my child hasn’t seen me piss myself or drive drunk. 

I am immensely, deeply grateful that I now have a life that I’m really proud of. If I have to give up the super bowl for that, then fuck it. It’s an easy choice",40

I didn't do a lot of coke but from time to time on a party I did it. Problem was that every time it was quite good and I only felt worse the day after, so I didn't think that it can do me any harm. Every time after 2 days I was completely alright. The last time I did it was the most I've ever done, it was 2 weeks ago and basically from that time I feel somehow different. It's this constant feeling that I am looking on the world through glass, I don't feel like me. I am thinking all the time if I didn't fuck up my brain permanently and from time to time I have panic attacks about it. I am very sure I don't want any more coke but I am just so scared if I'll go back to normal. I finally was getting good in life after a big accident and a break up and then this happens. 

Also I did quite a lot of alcohol, was getting fucked up probably twice a week. I want to stop drinking for at least a month now till I get back to normal hopefully.

2020-02-02 14:42:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/extuya/principles_before_personalities/,"""Principles Before Personalities. """," So I’ve been going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for quite some time now with my dad. Neither of us drink and he claims to go because he wants to meet people and reconnect with old friends apparently. I just go just for my personal amusement. It’s fun to watch losers talk about their pathetic lives in front of other losers.

But as you would expect, I’m not vocal at all about this at meetings. I just sit there silently trying to blend in without saying anything aside from the shit that everyone else says when everyone holds hands and are in a circle. It’s a feeling of *epicaricacy* that is hidden from everyone else.

I’ve heard some unique stories from my time there. There was once this man who grew up with his adopted family in Tijuana and then one day a robber came murdered his entire family when he wasn’t home. This guy claimed that the event put him in “so much rage” that’s what made him a drinker. When I told The Boy Named Crow about this, he just said “Damn that sucks.”. I said I thought that moment was pretty funny because of how cartoonish it was. It’s kinda weird that this one guy was apparently able to murder an entire household when just trying to kill 2 people on your own can be pretty difficult. It just fell into the realm of unreality.

There always seems to be an old woman with brown hair whenever I go there. I don’t know why.

Yesterday me and dad went to this meeting and this guy was telling this very long story and since we just walked in during the middle of it I don’t really know the whole story and he kept going on about rabbis and god or whatever. The room was really dark which made sense since it was at 10 something PM and I just kept staring at the white LED lights hung on the wall behind him as he spoke and the patterns they made or the ceiling fan and the slow movement it made before it made it’s eventual stop. I remember there was this old guy sitting in a chair in a corner of the room on my right saying stuff like “Oh god is this guy still talking?” but no one except me seemed to notice him when he said that at all.

When the guy finally stopped talking all of a sudden some guy in the crowd got up with his shitty acoustic guitar and started playing some shitty song and singing. I told dad “This song is shit.” and “We should split.”. But dad wanted to stay and said no and I can just go to the car and wait for him if I’d like. But I insisted that “We should go.” and eventually I decided to walk home by myself and asked for house keys, which he gave to me.

I just walked home alone that night listening to some podcast that doesn’t suck and went to sleep not long after returning home.
