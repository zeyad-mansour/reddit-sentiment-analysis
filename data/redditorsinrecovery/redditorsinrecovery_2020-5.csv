I'll start with some background. From March - June of 2019 I got clean off benzos, adderall/vyvanse, and drinking. Admittedly, I couldn't give up weed, but I felt a lot healthier mentally and physically having kicked the other crap I was putting in my body,

June 3rd, 2019 is where my progress ended. Sadly, my best friend shot himself that day. I'm not even close to getting over this, and it's becoming more challenging as we approach the anniversary.

In the time between my friends suicide and coronavirus lockdown, so about nine months (June 2019-March 2020), I've gone up and down as far as how sober I've been. There have been some low lows but also some periods of high functionality. I've been able to hold down a solid job this whole time and have a handful of good friends who provide me with support.

But ever since life became dominated by this virus, things have gotten even worse. My grandma died in March (although not of COVID) and even though this death was a more ""natural"" death than my friends suicide - she was 83 years old and passed peacefully in her sleep - it still rattles me, and gives me this awful feeling of being surrounded by death. And under lockdown, I am just alone with my thoughts, and I can't go hang out with friends and distract myself that way. I miss going to the movies, restaurants, etc.

So here's my current struggle. I just can't stop getting high all the time. And it's not just marijuana, either. I always want to add something ""extra"" to it. I've gone back to my old drugs of choice, unfortunately. Adderall, Ambien, and alcohol are the main foes in my rogues galley. 

I am not sure how physically addicted I am to any one of them, but psychologically I find it incredibly difficult not to take at least one daily. I just get so bored, or sad, or angry, or some other negative feeling and I alleviate it with drugs. I am weak. As silly or cliche as it might sound, I feel like I've lost a lot of the strength that I used to have. I feel like I used to have a lot more character before drugs began to take up so much of my time.

I want to get better, but what worked before seems almost unattainable now. I feel like it's impossible to get good therapy with my current setup. A telehealth appointment is really only helpful if I can find a private, secluded place to discuss my issues freely. But I live with a few other people and I wouldn't want them to overhear the conversations I have over the phone or webinar with a therapist. We have thin walls. It's a tough obstacle as minor as it may sound.

I don't know. This is all stream of consciousness. It's been helpful just to type it out. Would love to hear from any of you, whether it's advice, encouragement, opinions, whatever it might be. Thanks.",5
2020-05-29 21:45:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/gt5smt/reflecting_on_an_old_friends_recent_overdose_14/,"Reflecting on an old friend's recent overdose, 14 months into my own recovery. 💔","I've never posted here before but I have been a lurker for quite some time and I found myself going through a lot of emotions tonight and I just felt the need to post to try to process them all.  I hope this post is okay here, I also posted in r/opiatesrecovery.  I'll try to be brief.

About an hour ago I found out an old friend of mine overdosed on heroin last night and passed away. I'm heartbroken from the news.  It just hurts so badly.  He was such a gentle and sensitive soul. 😪

I haven't actually seen him since March of 2019.  I have been clean and sober since March 12th of last year.  For me, part of getting clean and actually staying clean this time involved largely cutting ties with everyone that was in any way a threat to my sobriety.  This included everyone I used to get high with and he was on that list.  

I would still check in occasionally on messenger, mostly with words of encouragement, letting him know that I cared about him and believed in him and wanted to see him clean and happy one day.

But now that won't ever happen. 💔

This isn't the first friend I've lost to addiction but it is still always a shock and ever so painful.

I found myself going through some of our old conversations and I was not prepared for the strong, complex emotions it brought up.  Or the way it would trigger me.  The conversations brought back vivid memories of the time we lived together with some other people in what was essentially a trap house.  I then found myself profoundly missing those times.

Which is insane.

It's hard for me to articulate this but sometimes I'm still caught off guard by how confusing and seemingly illogical my emotions can be and this time they were powerful emotions all intertwined with grief.  I know, beyond a doubt, that my time living there and for a short period after that were the worst, most chaotic times in my life.  I remember hating myself and wanting to end it all many times.  It was a constant cycle of trying to scheme a way to more money so I could stave off being sick for a little longer.  I was a slave and hopeless inside.  It was such a dark time.  I'll be continuing to pick up the pieces from that period of time for years to come.

And yet, at the same time, I missed it tremendously in ways I don't even understand.  Maybe it's that I was never alone then?  There were always people around me.  Even though I know all those people were just fellow users and it was all tangled up with our addictions.  It's difficult for me to pinpoint the reasons for my acute sense of longing for that era.  Maybe I just miss my old friends despite everything else.

Some of them were there for me during times when there was no one else there.  Desperate times.  I still miss them and love them, despite everything, even though I know none of them can be part of my life as long as they are in the midst of their active addictions.

I guess the short story is that, as you all know, recovery is a challenging path and can often be fraught with powerful emotions and urges that are so obviously counterproductive and illogical and yet overwhelming nonetheless.

I am going to miss my friend forever and it breaks my heart that I will never see him again and that he will never join me in recovery. 😪😪😪💔💔💔

I hope and pray that this is the last friend I ever lose to addiction.  

Thanks for reading this to any who do.  Recovery is possible.  Addiction is self-hatred and hoplessness.  Recovery is hope and love.  I believe in you.

TL;DR:  I'm 14 months into recovery and tonight I found out an old friend I used to use with passed away from an overdose last night and it brought up a lot of powerful and complex emotions for me.",31

I did what my program asked of me, and changed people places & things. That has worked great for me. Recently, one of my friends from middle school has gotten in contact with me. We we're best friends growing up, and very much like sisters. We were friends our entire lives pretty much. Which means eventually we also used together. She is not in recovery. I haven't spoken to her in about a year, she knows that I've been trying to get clean, although I don't think she understands the extent of it like most people dont if they arent in recovery. She wants to hang out, I talked to my network, and came up with that I could meet her at a park with her kids and we could hang out there. She's excited about that, but also suggested that me and her and some other friends from middle school hang out. I'm having some trouble telling her no, I haven't said anything at all. I know if I was to say yes it would be to not hurt anybody's feelings and to people please. I also don't want to just say no with out asking what hang out means to them.. But i know what it used to mean to me (using something). Nothing is worth my clean time.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to react to this? Any experience strength or hope?
Maybe Im looking too deep into this and should just see her at the park, calling my network (for accountability) before and after, and see where it goes from there?

What are the possibilities or answers after I cease to exist?,"People either choose to accept or refuse the inevitable cessation of existence but in the end we all think alike because we are all essentially the same, breed from the same energy and atoms the universe is made of. I don't want to cease experiencing and suddenly forced to lose everything valuable to me such as my memories and loved ones. It's scary to imagine ceasing to exist and experience anymore. It also pains that we cannot prove nor dissaprove what may occur after death without experiencing it. The thing about that thought is that I can't even imagine trying to experience nothingness as it is no-thing. I mean why do we have to learn to love this reality and then inevitably forced to die; not posses the ability to experience or be aware? I wish we all had the power of god and never had to deal with this anxiety. It's just not fair. Why is this part of the process of nature? Who made this rule of entropy and if so why do we have to deal with it? Why are we the pawns and why can't we part of the decision making?
My biggest questions revolves around consciousness and the purpose of gaining the power to love just so we can eventually loose the possessive ability to be aware. 
Is it a blessing or a curse to possess the ability of self awarenes and consciousness?
Are other primitive creatures lucky to not have to fear the ponder such anxieties?
Would it have been better to live a relaxing life not having to worry about not being able experiencing such joy anymore? Just like a cat does.
Would it have been better to have not experience at all so that we dont have loose eventually everything? I know I am asking a lot of questions that have no answers to. I know the outcomes are impossible to determine and is incomprehensible. Which is why it terrifies me and as a logical and critical, scientific perspective mind I have learned to learn. I cannot find a resolution or excuse to cope with this constant anxiety and fear. I am always yearning for answers, but it doesnt help when its impossible to determine or comprehend.
I am only 15 and I understand I have so much more to learn and understand. I know I have to eventually find my own purpose and meaning but it's difficult when I always think ahead, I to come to a dead end that which is death and then I begin to loose the meaning of everything. Perhaps I need to teach myself to give everything a meaning... I don't even know at this point because my thoughts just cycling over and over again to the same things. I find it so hard to sleep or even focus because when I do it reminds me of what I fear. When I close my eyes I imagine what it would be like to not posses consciousness, it's like going to sleep but without dreaming... That closing my eyes for one second is equivalent to forever but without ever realizing it. The more I learn the more I become more freighted of this reality.. Ever since then I search for a reason or a resolution to this suffering, constantly repeatedly finding my in the same spot. Not being able to ease nor rest my mind or soul till the day I die.. I guess that's when peace will take its effect, hopefully. This universe and reality is ludacris having no choice but to partake in it again.
My corrupted imagination is the result of my fears, born with these amazing and wonderful abilities but with every positive outlook there is a equal price to pay.

Idk. I guess I’m just looking for some help. I never want to go back to where I was but if I continue “chipping” that’s the only destination this path leads to.",3

i’ve been sober (heroin addict) in AA for 3 years this past april. i have 2 sponsees, a sponsor, home group and service commitment. i attend weekly meetings and have a spouse in recovery who has 4 years. 

lately i’ve been feeling distant and confused, wondering where my life lines up with recovery and questioning my 1st step.. the only step i’m told i MUST work right, or else. 

as i take my sponsees thru the work, i’m faced with the fact that i’m hearing my voice in a language that seems distant and foreign to my current day self. i’m beginning to refrain from seeing and interacting with certain people because i fear the feelings that follow, such as my desire to drink and test the waters. i spend some days researching different recovery programs and studies on people’s ability to maintain normalcy and controlled drinking after recovery from addiction. 

i speak to my husband about it and he sees and understands what i’m going thru and wants me to have my process. 

i just don’t understand why i feel like this. but i can’t ignore the fact that something doesn’t feel right. is remaining sober out of fear at this point in my
recovery healthy? how free can i truly be if the motivating factor is the fact i’ve been told ‘to drink is to die’ and stepping away from this program is ‘signing a death warrant’. 

why can’t i just be ok with this idea of turning my life over to god? am i supposed to be like the women in my home group who share at 7, 8 years sober that they still want to kill themselves? maybe i need to find a new group? 

i am not looking for an answer, more of an experience. everything in me tells me that it’s ok to grow and search for new experiences. but i feel programmed to believe these thoughts are my ‘disease’ trying to sabotage me. 

i’m not planning to act on any feelings in this moment but i just need to put them out to the universe.",1
2020-05-19 10:09:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/gmp9lt/needing_courage/,Needing courage,"Hi everybody. This is my first time using reddit and my first time reaching out for support from fellow addicts. So here's my story: I'm a 28 year old female who is addicted to painkillers. I suffer from life crippling anxiety and depression. I first started using painkillers when I was 19, a boyfriend introduced them to me and I had no idea how addictive they were or what I was getting into. I was raised in a Christian household with strict rules and was in a rebellious phase. I used painkillers for years untill I got into a subxone treatment program. Eventually I didn't need the suboxone and quit that and was completly drug free for about a 8 months. But then I met another boy and turned out he used painkillers. I should of just broke up with him but I was 23 and in love so I didn't. Eventually I couldn't resist the temptation anymore and started using again and it was all downhill from there. I ended up getting fired from my job because I came in noticeably high and ended up in a mental hospital for being suicidal. That job was my life, well at least that's where all my friends were and it paid well with benefits. I thought that was me hitting rock-bottom. So I broke up with the boyfriend and moved back home with my family who is still unaware about my addiction issues. I think they have a suspicion but they have never confronted me on it. My family is big on avoiding issues and not talking about our emotions or promblems. 
I ended up finding a new job and had my addiction under control, I was still using but I was managing to keep it under control and it wasn't effecting my life in any major ways, mostly just my finances. But then I ended up getting a dui, which I totally deserved I was drunk out of my mind and had no business being behind the wheel. I had my first hearing but then managed to get a 2nd DUI before I was offically convicted of the first one. The 2nd dui was a little bit different. I had stopped after work for dinner with friends and had 2 beers and a shot. I felt completly fine to drive, didn't even feel tipsy. But the cops were watching to see what cars were at the bars and when i left they pulled me over using the excuse that the lights were out above my back licence plate. I took the breathalyzer never imaging I would be over the legal limit but I was just barely over. So fast forward I ended up getting sentenced to 45 days house arrest and a year long suspension on my license for the 2nd dui. 
While all that legal trouble was playing out i had managed to find another job, a great one that paid well and had good benefits. Only promblem was it was a 45 minute commute from my house. So when I got the second dui sentence I straight up panicked. All I wanted was a fresh start and to be able to stand on my own two feet and make a life for myself. So I kinda sorta never reported to probation. And wierdly enough they never came looking for me. So I just kept ignoring it. But since I had to drive to work I ended up getting pulled over for driving on a suspended license. Which I also ignored like an idiot. Once again no one ever came looking for me. So I just kept going on with my life.
However it was affecting my life because I lived so far from my friends and I only drove to get to work because I was too scared to get pulled over again. And I was living in constant anxiety. At this point I was just so terrified of dealing with my legal issues because I didnt want to start all over again like I had to when I thought I had hit rock bottom. 
So I ended up getting pulled over again for a second time with a suspended license and now my court date for that is rapidly approaching. I finally managed to save up ebough money to afford a lawyer and I know i need to go to this court date. But im still just absolutely terrified. I've stopped drinking and im back in a suboxone treatment program. Im not the same person I was years ago when I got the dui's. I've grown up alot and have gotten a tad bit wiser. But I know I'm pretty much screwed and looking at jail time and losing my life again. I know now that if I ever want a true fresh start im going to have to face the consequences for my past actions but that doesn't make it any less terrifying. 

So if anybody has any advice or encouraging words for how to deal with your past mistakes coming back to haunt you when you finally have your act together i greatly appreciate it.",1

NEED ADVICE,"I’m going to try and keep this as direct and to the point as possible but we have an immense amount of back history that pertains to this situation, so it will be difficult.
Best friend since middle school. We both liked to party as teens and young adults and by our mid 20’s we both became addicted to heroin. I had a short run, around 18 months. My friend has been going on and off for 9 years. Lost both her kids, brother overdosed and died last February. Father died unexpectedly in 2009, mother is an alcoholic. The girls been through it.
When I did a stint back in 2013 and got paroled to a sober house about an hour away from my hometown I decided it was best to start over in a new area because “people, places and things” definitely hindered my sobriety. 
Jump to 2018, my friend is struggling HARD. She is now suicidal and tells me she just wants to buy a bundle and end it all. That’s when I jump in full force to “save her” 
Within 48 hours she has moved in with me. We set the rules and make a plan for her recovery. You guys need to know that leading up to this she had already been to multiple rehabs. 
Her moving in with me was a last resort. 

So, she moves in. She finally has a safe, warm and clean place to stay, with food in the fridge and anything she may need at her fingertips. We (husband and I) lay out our expectations; meetings, drug tests, contributions to the household (accountability) 
I helped her get a job right away and we agreed that I would monitor her income and store her money in a safe we had in the house and would essentially make sure she wasn’t buying dope with her paycheck. All was well, she lived with us for 3 months. Once we all felt comfortable with her progress we found her a nice one bedroom apartment and at that point she had saved enough for the security deposit, first months rent and still had a sizable amount of money as a cushion. So we go and open up a bank account for her and within days she relapses.  Fortunately, it was a quick  relapse and she got back on track. It’s been about 2 years now and since she’s been in such close proximity to me I get to see her often and know when she’s using and  when she’s not using. We have a very open relationship and she has always been honest with me (when I confront her) (stinger)
I know there has been multiple relapses but she always owns it and gets back on track....
Today was different. And this is where I need some help. I stopped by her apartment like I do all the time and her boyfriend (who has been in and out of her life for 4 years) walks outside and has marks on his arms and hands that were very clearly injection sites. 
My friend is smart and was wearing long sleeves, cause I would have freaked out if I saw that on her and she knows I’d call her out. 
So friend walks to the front of the house to spray for ants (the reason I came over, to bring her some spray) and I ask her boyfriend about the marks on his arms (very nonchalant) like, “dude, what happened to your arm?” He then quickly says he had blood dawn and changes the subject. THESE WERE NOT MARKS LEFT BY GETTING BLOOD DRAWN. 
As I continued our conversation I made a point of Discreetly checking out the rest of his body. His hands had the same marks. I know all about injection sites and I knew right away with the location of his marks and how they looked that there was no doubt in my mind he was using.  I can only assume that my friend is also using.
I’m at a point where I feel I’ve done everything I can do to help her in her recovery and to help her stay on track. 
It pains me to know that no matter what I say or do she is going to continue to make her own choices and essentially continue to dig her own grave.  I’m beside myself. I don’t have “girlfriends” 
I grew up a tomboy and she really is my only true friend. 
I don’t know how to interject at this point. 
I feel like I’ve done everything I can possibly do to help her. It’s so out of my hands. 
I reached out through text, essentially saying “yeah, I know what’s going on but I love you regardless” 
But, the big question is, how do I continue our relationship in a healthy way for us both? 
I wish I was in a position to put everything in my life on hold to make sure she doesn’t relapse again but that isn’t a reality. She’s a big girl and I feel that at this point no matter what I say or do, she is going to do whatever she wants regardless of the support she has and the consequences that lie in her continuing to use. 
I don’t know how to continue our relationship. Do I distance myself? Do I express myself honestly and in turn hurt our relationship? Do I allow the distance and spend who knows how long wondering how she’s doing? 
I feel like I need to be easy with all this because I’m so afraid she will shut me out and I won’t know when she’s struggling and she won’t be comfortable reaching out to me.  It’s such a delicate situation. I’m really at a crossroads. Any insight or advice would be great appreciated.  Such a rant, thank you to all that made it this far.",1

Lately though my tolerance has been rising as expected when once uses anything addictively for sometime, you need more but that doesn’t automatically means that more will give the same effects or that they will be as strong as they were say after you stopped for sometime. Again I’m not entirely sure what this post is because I have a bad habit of forgetting the important thoughts or revelations that occur during these hard times, I can only try to recreate it but to no avail.",1

The warm weather triggers something in me- but being honest, I don’t need a reason to drink or use. Sunny day, rainy day, bad day, good day to celebrate, spilled coffee, promotion. Doesn’t matter. I have over a year clean and sober and I sat out front a liquor store yesterday, I also texted an old friend (aka dealer) to start the scheming process.
Now my son is with his dad for a week vacation- so my disease is telling me no one will know, I deserve it, my hearts broken, self pity blah blah. 

Now I know last time, and every single time, I tried to have one beer, one glass of wine, it ended badly. Maybe not that day, or week , sometimes it sneakily waits for a month. And then BAM, I’m literally at rock bottom, missing work, losing custody, not payment rent and alone because my family is over it.

I’ve struggled with not being able to go to meetings, yet that’s jsut an excuse. they are online, xa speakees dot come is available, I have my book. But I’ll use covid as a reason. I’m restless irritable and feel discontent. I’m lonely and bitter and angry. I’m a dry drunk, as I have not completed the steps so I have found that spiritual freedom I’ve been looking for my whole life. 
I guess today is a good day to not pick up, and put my recovery first. 

Thanks for letting me share. Xo

\*edit\* - I should mention that I'm already enrolled in drug therapy, but due to the virus I've only been able to do online meetings with my case worker. I know I have an addiction, I have tried groups but I found them to be a little lovey-dovey. I want practical advice, not to have my ass eaten in a zoom meeting every week.

I'm 23, have been smoking weed since I was 14, chronically and daily (give or take a few months here or there) since I was 17. I'm getting to a point where I feel like I have to quit in order to pursue my goals. I've recognized that my use is largely to deal with depression and anxiety as a result of a shitty childhood, but it's robbing me of money and focus that I could be putting into improving myself.

I've tried to quit multiple times, so I know my psychological withdrawal sucks. However, what I'm dealing with is almost  kind of nihilism regarding my use. Like, the world is crumbling and life is short, why should I stop something I enjoy? This attitude clashes with my desire to be more, and I'm kinda caught in the middle. Today is the first day of a new attempt at cold turkey. I've tried to phase it out before and it never works for me, I'm too impulsive.

So, I guess I'm looking for some advice. How can I get past this defeatist mindset that is just helping me cave when I'm feeling weak. I know there are positives to sobriety, and I'm well aware of all the negative effects of my use, but still I'm trying to bargain with myself. Any advice would be great.

Best,

I come from a fine family. They did tell me I couldn’t be home/around my younger brother as long as I was under any influence. I get it. Now that I’m getting clean and sober they are letting me come home.

My younger brother (12 now) is starting to ask questions about why I wasn’t around so much these past few years (I’m 23 and haven’t been home for a holiday in at least a year). My family did a pretty good job of keeping the truth from him while maintaining a positive image of me (school, with my girlfriend at the time, travel issues). I would still FaceTime occasionally. I don’t agree with the lies, but I respect it. 

Now that I’m getting my act together, I want to tell him the truth. My family does not support this decision and I have no experience to look at. I obviously don’t want to tell him all of the details but he’s a smart kid. He knows something is up. 

I’d like to tell him that I was really sad and instead of asking for help I used drugs and alcohol to try and feel better but they actually made things worse. I’m still sad but I’m getting help from professionals and support from friends and don’t want to drink or use anymore. I love him and if he ever feels sad that I will be here for him. Mental illness is no stranger to our gene pool. As you can maybe tell, openness about them is. 

Anyway, is he too young? Have any of you talked to a kid about getting sober? How did it go? Are there any books or articles I can read about this that you’d recommend?",6

My clean date is November 14, 2019, the day I woke up in a treatment center in Pembroke Pines, FL, and away from the people, places and things in Houston, TX. that brought me and kept me in my active addiction and made my life unmanageable.
After 16 days of partial hospitalization program and 1 1/2 months of intensive outpatient, I had to return to Houston to return to work.
I'm with the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship.
I have since been in a constant state of nearly relapsing, several times each week, due to isolation, work sidelining me (which excuses me from any random drug.testing) and somehow, I managed to tell myself each day, not to pick up. 

I crawled my way to my imaginary blue keytag. But I'm afraid of what day 186 or day 190 or day 201 will feel. I have other addictions that are not drug or alcohol related in which my sponsor just can't help me with. But she has been calling me each day to figure out coping skills from my many other demons and she has helped a lot so far. 

This is just a piece of my journey. I'm a newcomer here. And I will resume my lurking around to stay clean.",72

I am a very high functioning addict by the way but I finally got the courage to admit I’m an addict today without crying. With that revelation I decided to tell my mom I’ve been using. I didn’t tell her to the extent or how bad things are but I did say how I use my scripts up and then need to buy off the street and that if I quit I would go through withdrawals and I’m scared of that. 

She responded by telling me if it makes me happy then so what. But it’s not so what. My tolerance is getting higher every day and I’m scared I’ll switch to something more and worse and when I tried to explain that she just told me not to. Then got mad at me because I went to get on my nightly NA meeting, calling me selfish for being on my phone even knowing I was attending a NA meeting. 

I just wanted her to tell me that she will support me with recovery. Or tell me she was going to help me get help. Instead I just feel like she justified my use. The only thing she was mad about was that I was using my money for drugs instead of helping her with bills. 

And it’s not that she doesn’t understand addiction. My dad is an alcoholic who has been sober for 10 years so she knows what addiction is and still just pushed mine aside because when I use I’m productive and helpful and nicer. The problem is when I run out or when the day comes I’ll need something more. 

I just don’t know what else to do or how to get help. I’ve tried quitting all week and get to 24 hours then relapse. I just can’t do this alone.

Edit: I go into detox and then residential treatment on Monday. I explained more to my mom about my addiction and that I need help and although she still isn’t the most supportive I have opened up to others who are supporting me. Thank you everyone for the kind words",25

I've been struggling with my drug addictions during this quarantine. I want to be sedated and just waste away during this time but I have realized that I can't because I need to further myself up the ladder and get the fuck out my rock bottom hole. 

However, a part of me badly wants to use drugs ""responsibly"" and also get shit done. I can't do so without using the proper drugs like Adderall and Oxy80s. Compared to Meth & Fentanyl and the occasional puff of crack. 

I've been doing really well with my health as of recently and don't want to fuck shit up. 28 days ago I had my second overdose and ended up in the hospital. Shit sucked, and my Mom flushed away $$$$$$'s worth of drugs.

That alone made me want to relapse immediately and still is fucking with my mind to this moment and time.
I want to get an education. I want to be buff. I want to be smart. I want to have fun!

Drugs don't do that alone for me. I need a good environment and a happy life. I used drugs during the best times of my life and that's whats made me confuse the two. The drug alone did not bring me all that happiness. It was the people, the environment etc and me being high fused together that created my addiction.",6

She didnt really seem overly affected by hearing that news which pissed me off... her narcissism and selfishness is off the charts. Look at me though lol. 

Anyway I'm wondering how many people can relate to this junkie manipulation? 

On a positive note I havent relapsed since the breakup so tomorrow is day 13 for me. We go on the same Zoom AA meetings and its been so tempting for me to just curse her out in front of everybody. She fuckin posted a bunch of shit on facebook about the breakup for everyone to see then blocked me.

 I have way more recovery in my 13 days then she does in 10 months. I'm trying to ease the hate and resentment as my sponsor reccomends. It's not easy tho, definitely a whirlwind romance the whole time. When we met I had a year and she had 60 days. 2 kids plus a baby daddy that she ditched for me. Of course I was going to prove everyone else wrong by having it be a successful relationship. Now my friends are all ""I told you so.""",18

My boyfriend of 2 years is currently in treatment after 4 years of sobriety. Today is his 4th day of treatment (after a week in a detox center).

He leaves behind debt, a dog (of which I have assumed guardianship), a lease with 7 more months, and possible criminal charges in the wake of this relapse. He has also stolen items and money from myself and his family to feed his addiction during this time.

As he's only allowed one 10 minute phone call a week so we've been writing daily letters. I've been reluctant to talk about anything other than how the day is going, how everyone is doing, and words of encouragement. I don't know if it would be useful to this stage of recovery to share my feelings about how I've been affected by this. I know that time for amends will come later and that it will be up to him to make those.

My question to you all is, in the early stages of recovery, what kind of things would you want to hear from your significant other that would support your recovery best?",4

To all you mothers out there. So now to get to the title. Well lets see tomorrow i start treatment at this inpatient facility and im terrified that its not going to work or help me reasons being is that two years ago i was here this exact same spot about to start treatment but under different circumstances like court ordered and not so much a facility more like incarcerated and the jail treatment program which is 90 days but actually turned into 124. I participated in that program with my whole heart i out everything i had into trying to be better and it worked for about seven months and then i relapsed and relapsed again and relapsed again with this last one lasting until present. After that first relapse i felt completely broken and like a fool to believe that i could change and that i had it in the bag that addiction wasnt a thing i had to worry about anymore. And now the scary thing is that i feel like part of me has accepted this as this is who i am and who i will be like its ok or something even though i know its not. Like i used to think better of myself but since i went down this path i just feel like im a scummy person who doesnt deserve good happy things cuz look what i choose to do to myself over and over again. I know my self worth is shot and self love is next to nothing. Im just scared that my brain is thinking this way. Like have i gone to far??? Is there a way to fix these thoughts i have about myself. Do people really learn to love themselves after addiction or is that just what they say cuz thats what they have been told over and over again?? Is there really a way to learn to cope without drugs once you have done it with drugs for so long??? I want so bad to be who i  was before i went down this road. Is it possible??? Can i be that sister daughter friend wife mother that i once was or am i always just going to be this low life?? I feel so hopeless and scared and defeated and low low low. Im supposed to be going into treatment monday and hopeless is not how i should feel i should feel hopeful right??? Any advice or if anyone has felt these feelings  how did it turn out for you? How can i change how im feeling??? Is the reason im feeling all these things is it because i have been actively using for so long that its just the drugs or am i really starting to see this for what it is and what it is im screwed and forever a junkie i will be??? I just dont know???,8

I'm the admin for a non-profit recovery center in a rural community. We serve primarily incarcerated, recently incarcerated, struggling parents, and homeless populations. Our primary funders are Medicaid and grants- I say that to say this, we do our best but we're not a fancy resort center on a beach. Calling it something like ""The Palms' is just going to make people laugh. 

Our program includes individual therapy, group therapy, intensive outpatient therapy, psychological testing, psychosocial assessments, dietary consult, parenting, marriage, and family therapy, and employment services. We're working on housing services soon. 

&#x200B;

Our program has grown significantly in the 3 years since it began and we no longer like the name. Currently, it's just called Addiction Services- which feels really clinical and a little shame-y. We'd like something new to call the overarching program. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, if we were the creative sort, it would have had a better name to start with. So I'm open to suggestions.

At 17 months sober, I've spent my recovery in 3 sober livings; 3 months in a halfway house, 2 months in a 3/4 house, and the remainder in an ""advanced recovery"" house.
At this point I live in a pretty plush environment, when the owner of the house isn't coming by to give unwarranted life lessons about trivial things. I have my own room, and 3 people living in a house with 5 bedrooms.
I am a musician, and am in 2 bands, and have a few craft hobbies I like to exercise. However, the responsibilities of being at certain meetings certain days a week along with house duties outside normal chores are starting to weigh in on my personal time. Before covid hit, and when meeting Halls are reopened, I will have a solid idea of when and where any meeting going on is.
I have been wanting to move out into a less structured environment for some time, as I believe sober living can become a crutch, and I have spent over a year at my current home. 
One of my bandmates tonight mentioned that he has a 2 bedroom apartment and an extra room he'd be willing to rent me. This would help, since I wouldn't have to put down a first/last/deposit upon moving in; and they are into similar things as I am. We also get along very well.
The part that concerns me is that he smokes weed somewhat regularly and drinks occasionally. I have been around drugs and alcohol in my recovery quite often and have has no issue with any desire to use.

Most of us would not normally hang out together or be friends but we have this damn disease in common.  Getting and staying sober has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me, by far.  

I make a lot of mistakes, I fight.  I bitch and moan.  I also am giving, loving, dependable, spiritual, teachable and chill.  I’m a human being with a range of emotions and no longer ruled by the drink or drugs.  

If you are new and thinking that it’s impossible to get 11 years or 11 days, I get it.  I used to think 30 days was impossible and people that could were Gods.  My alcoholism was crippling.  My vision was myopic.

Today, it is different.  Today I can be my best self and recover if and when I make a mistake.  A minor bummer is that I can’t blame my bad behavior on alcohol like I used to.  It’s just me, a sober human being doing this life thing in the middle of a pandemic one day a time as best that I can.

Was released from a psych ward after a 4 day stay mainly to detox. Left with no medications, because i was crawling in my skin and was clearly not thinking correctly. 

I was abusing acute acting benzos heavily (~ 5mg xanax daily) for 3 weeks prior. Feeling shaky and as if the Librium treatment didn't fully withdraw me from benzodiazepines.

My question is whether or not the Librium is out of my system in order to garner me access to live in a sober living facility? Or do i need to detox again? I'm at my wits end

I took Ecstasy and Tramadol/any Painkillers , for the last 3.5 years I’ve been taking pills non-stop. Smoking made it worse in the long run, it’s funny they tell us don’t do drugs but never get into which ones and how they look. At 15 I realized I had Depersonalization (Mental illness) but ignored it and kept doing drugs. All sophomore year I was drugged out , skipping school or not going at all. I ended up missing many days of school which lead me to going to court during the summer . During this phase I came to the realization that it was drugs keeping me away from %100 great mental health again. I was scared to smoke in fear of jail time so I quit, but pills? They stayed until 4 days before my court date. I had the worst withdrawals in my life that summer and it sucks. My last court date comes and I go, finish what I was told to do and I get dropped off home. I’m now in my room in a empty house because my family left (work) . I grabbed a bag of weed and rolled it up and after the first hit, my sense and grip of reality left. DP set in and I realized what caused the problem for my mental health. I threw that shit away but I still took pills, weed withdrawal isn’t something I cared about because the pill withdrawal hurt. I’m 16, going through terrible withdrawals hurting this where I went down a dark abyss. I was in drama/bs in school, povert at home, and a addict going through DP everyday. The only highlight of getting up in the morning, are the few seconds before I open my eyes and realize my problems and struggles. It’s a small moment of bliss it’s the closet I felt to being happy, oblivious to my problems or my own self harm before reality sets in. Pills pushed me backwards I wanted to quit but I needed them to get out of bed , speak, be productive, shower, leave my room, if it was anything physical if I wasn’t high I didn’t wanna do it. I was fucked up and ignored it because it’s how I coped. I would cry when it got bad on my knees balled up in the bathroom wanting to be free but the withdrawals hurt. I wanted to kill myself at one point thinking it’s no way out For me, this is life and for a year and 7 months it was until it got so bad I had to quit smoking and doing drugs or it was like nothing was real (DP). I was tired of crying, hurting my self, hurting my mental health , pretending to be fine, so I stopped for 2 months and hit some weed again, cool temptation will get u if your not strong. Finally on December, 27 2018 I smoked for the very last time I told myself I’m done and as of now , 16 months and 24 Days of no smoking. I still was popping pills I couldn’t handle withdrawals at work/school. I worked as a dishwasher, 17 new to it all. I had to be on drugs to work or I’d be sluggish barely working. I was ashamed of it but I brushed it off like I always do because I hate being social about myself . Depersonalization got worse during my pill taking, I couldn’t do anything without them like I’ve mentioned but it got worse because I finally had money of my own to buy drugs. I used to steal and burglarize for money . Everyday to go home to a terrible home where I slept on the floor , no pillow , covers , nothing but couch cushions that were too small. I’m really crying I used to cry about not having nothing to my name. My father died and we went into poverty. Tears are coming out of me because he was the reason why Im like this now I lost him before I graduated 8th grade . I wish He could see me, see what I’ve done, see my first girlfriend, my first conflict at school, my first job , my first fight , I was too young to understand how much he had done for me, I’m too late to let him know now. After that I’ve done so much and it hurts my dad can’t see me become a man on May 27 . I wish I could show him who he raised, walk across the stage , go to college, he left and I got into the street’s as of June of 2016. I can finally say it’s over dad, Im out the streets dad no more stealing pops , no more drugs , Ive been hurt for so long And it’s finally over. I’m sober as of May 3rd 2020. I quit April 1st last month due to Covid-19 and no job I couldn’t support my habit and that’s the best thing I got out of it. I don’t feel like I need to be high during work anymore, to socialize, talk to my family, friends, to love , to care, anything I’m finally starting to feel better, no withdrawals/ losing weight (I’m 97Ibs) /I drink more water and exercise at home. I naturally feel great without drugs and I love it. I don’t need pills Anymore dad your son made it out his situation. I’m going to his old house to take pictures and pay tribute at your grave pops.

1. i fucking love xanax
2. my prescription to it controls my life
3. i have tried to reduce/stop my use unsuccessfully
4. i have purchased it illegally
5. i take it when i dont need it
6. it kills my motivation to do anything, even things i once enjoyed

8. i want to stop taking it but i can’t
9. if i had access to any other downers, i would probably take them
10. i have taken other drugs when i didn’t need them (prescription percocet)
11. all of this makes me hate xanax

I don’t know if i’m an addict or not. i feel like i don’t belong in AA or NA because i haven’t had a “rock bottom”, i don’t have any war stories, i don’t do street drugs. so i don’t really feel validated. if you would share your advice or opinion below it would be really helpful. i feel so trapped.",4

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."" I think about this often when trying to battle addiction. Drugs are the equivalent of giving a man a fish because they instantly give me a good feeling, but only for a small and temporary amount of time. Not doing drugs is the equivalent of teaching a man how to fish because without them I can learn how to feel good on my own, without relying on drugs.

Fighting your addiction is taking the hard path to happiness and satisfaction. But in the long run taking this path will lead to much higher levels of happiness and satisfaction that will last for a lifetime rather than a temporary period of time.

I talk about this a little in a youtube video if any of you  want to check it out.
