I’m finding myself having so much more energy to focus on more important things. 2020 is going to be the year I turn it all around. If I stay sober for all of 2020, it’ll be the first year I’ve gone completely alcohol free since the first time I picked up a drink when I was 12.... in 2000. 20 years of drinking. I’m so excited to see how great a year can be without alcohol. I’ve completely forgotten what that’s like. 

I’m so excited to become the best version of myself.",76

I have recently started taking a guy through the steps, but he relapsed, checked himself into a mental health treatment center, and he just got out but I haven't chatted with him much since, so Im not sure where we stand.

My sponsor asked me to do some service work and give a lead tomorrow and I told him Im really not sure because I get nervous speaking in crowds, I gave a lead another time and it lasted 15 minutes and there was still 30 minutes left in the meeting, I felt so embarrassed. I share in meetings and like to talk one on one with other alcoholics, but I really don't want to lead.

Am I wrong for thinking this, and would it be wrong to tell him I don't want to do it on very short notice? I've tried to psych myself into it and its just not something I want to do.

Any advice could help!",10

I've never had time to focus on an actual life since all my energy has gone into either sustaining an addiction or 'white knuckling' it in sobriety.

It seems like a shift has changed recently in the past 6 months where I don't actually even get a positive effect from ANY substances anymore. Like at ALL. Which is really crazy because there has ALWAYS been SOME positive effect whether it's the rush or immediate feeling of bliss or whatever, but all that has kind of faded and it seems I no longer really value ANY aspect of the experience. It's kind of depressing but also a godsend and a miracle because my desire to use chemicals has kind of faded on its own accord. I didn't really do much other than experience the negatives so much that these days it's like I really just sort of get tired when I even think about using. Despite this, I have still been experimenting once a month or so. 

I have decided to stay completely abstinent from everything other than my medications (obviously) with the end of this year and new beginnings all that shit blah blah. I was wondering how others have coped with realizing that you're actually gonna start trying to live life without drugs, and that means a career, money, responsibilities, especially emotional responsibilities such as being able to function without chemical crutches, or being there for loved ones even when you're 'too tired' or 'too stressed out', or physically ill. I'm basically like FUCK, I have no skills, no career, no nothing. Nothing to show for the last decade of my life, at all really. The only skills I've learned are basically how to survive on the streets, how to 'thrive' in jail, how to steal and scam, and how to be violent when I need to be. Basically EVERYTHING i've been working on developing is now USELESS and I feel like i'm starting over as a shell of a human. This is depressing.

Does anyone have any advice on how to become a wordly, decent human? How do I manage time and know how to devote what time to what? Can i even afford to have hobbies or down time anymore or do I just need to play extreme catch up?

&#x200B;

TLDR: 27 year old man - child deciding to finally get completely sober, realizes he knows nothing of the world, and only has skills and abilities that serve drug using/selling. Feel like it's too late to 'make something of myself', looking for tips/advice/how other people faced this big looming fact that i've wasted all my life thus far....

Carlin once said that ""stuff"" will eventually bring “[almost \[only\] pain and \[...\] hardly any pleasure](https://lsd-something-something.tumblr.com/post/157228080656/i-think-theres-a-degree-of-luck-and-intellect)”.  I’m reminded of these words as I sit alone at 1 am in my apartment, unable to fall asleep and feeling genuinely sad for myself. After abstaining from ""my thing"" for almost a month, I was hoping today would be a roller coaster of pleasure and satisfaction. Instead, I have strained my body to its limits - I’ve had almost no water all day, haven’t eaten anything since lunch, heart rate and blood pressure are absurd (cardiovasculaRIP), I can’t catch my breath, I’m fidgeting and sweating like a mother fucker and my two most sensitive organs are wrecked, no exaggeration. All for nothing because I’ve had the suckiest sesh ever. My expectations were as high as the subsequent disappointment. I never learned to listen to myself.

There is a silver lining though. I’ve had ""my thing"" since Monday yet I’ve managed to resist for an entire week. With surprising ease I might add. Even more surprising, the thought of finishing what’s left of it repulses me. This has *literally* ***never*** happened before. I want to believe it means I’ve broken the habit. I have escaped. 

I no longer need you, old friend. I accept *with all my heart and mind*  that it’s not possible to achieve with you what I’ve been trying (and failing) to achieve all these years. These voids must be filled some other way, I *understand and feel* that I have to find solutions not substitutions. It’s been fun (this time for real) and I’m grateful that the saga ends with such hopeful conclusions and not with uncertainty, fear, delusions, unfulfillable promises and false expectations. I’ve reached the point Carlin’s talking about. I am done making excuses on your behalf only to get hurt by ~~you~~ myself.

Goodbye, old friend. ",6

I came so close to just asking for a line which would have sent me in to a spiral... 

I made it through the night stayed out till 3am in the bar without touching it (just a couple energy drinks) and I'm so proud! It was my first night out since becoming clean. I went to bed when I got home and fell straight to sleep. Didn't lie there heart racing and craving another to keep from coming down. I didn't have a running sore nose. I didn't have a come down. I've woken up this morning feeling great! I did good. I'm proud of myself. 

This was a big step for me just wanted to share it.

Edited to add:
This isn't a frequent thing. It is our yearly Xmas meet up but last year I was using it. I had a sober friend with me all night which helped. My other friends group apart from one don't use either. I stayed out as we planned to share a taxi to our home town. It was definitely a rare thing and hope reunion next year will feel even easier. I spend my recreation time in fitness classes instead of bars usually, several hobbies at home and a few other things that keep me occupied. I also am terrified to ever go near it again as I found out I have a huge chance of genetic heart condition that I'm having testing for!

I was having to tell myself I could only do it 3 or 4 times a week, each time only being at 5 a.m right before work. I'd even bring a pipe to smoke out of at work to use on my breaks and eventually that wasnt cutting it. It was all I thought about. I spent 2 or 3 days wide awake. I would go out to random places around the neighborhood all night and morning until work because I couldn't sleep. I lost 15 pounds in the first 2 weeks of heavy using and my family even mentioned it but I played it off saying I was on my feet a lot at work. I had to stop, not because I wanted to, but because of a lot of other reasons that made it inaccessible. So I beat the physical addiction part but now, many months later I find myself craving it so bad and the worst part is I know exactly how to get it whenever I want it. But I don't feel like I qualify as an addict simply because I only used for a shorter period of time and I dont use anymore but I dont really know where else to go to be honest, and I feel like anybody else who has had a meth addiction will think that I didnt have it nearly as bad and I never really had a problem like they did so it makes looking for help a lot harder for me. As of a month or two ago the desire has been getting so strong I can barely handle it. I really want to be part of a group of other people in a situation who can help me. I know if I start using again, I'm going to lose everybody in my life but it is getting to a point where I really dont even care.",0

As of right now, it's not so important anymore. I've been away taking care of other people and then trying to recuperate from surgery. I no longer have friends or family. And as much as I fought in this life to have a decent life, I have ended up in an unthinkable situation. I have ended up homeless. Not knowing how to survive I have tried churches, charities and everything else to no avail. If I were willing to give my dog up it would be a different situation.
            If I drank, I would have less inhibitions. I would not be so terrified. I'm not in a place that I can Panhandle. I wouldn't be able to do that unless I were drunk... how do I keep myself from saying to hell with it?    I have no gas to make it from point A to point B. I'm diabetic and I'm going without food. I was supposed to have money reimbursed a month ago but the insurance company lost the paperwork. I can't do this anymore.

Edit... somebody that got drunk last night sent me $7.88! How's that for irony?  I have had so much wonderful emotional support here so glad that I found this page. and I feel better then I did first thing this morning. I also had good luck being able to post on the assistance page which I did not think could happen for another 15 days. So some good things might be starting to happen. Please pray for me.


 One thing I did not mention. I have a really bad infection on my foot. That's the reason I'm not out busting my ass trying to make a living. I am not too proud to work under any circumstances. Crap I pick up the parking lot that I sleep in just because I don't like litter. It would be wonderful to get paid for it but I can only do so much. Anyway you people are wonderful!

I made it “officially” to day four almost two hours ago, the longest I’ve managed to stay sober since May. I know it’s not much, but it’s a big deal to me. 

I got fired yesterday from a bartending job. I told my bosses I was going sober and their response to it was that they don’t think the bar industry is a good place for someone like me and that I was no longer a good fit for the job, then sent me on my way. 

I’ve been going over everything in my head...  over and over again. I mean, they’re right, but getting let go right before Christmas really fucking blows. I’ve been at war with myself over it all. You may have seen some of my previous posts.. I’ve been in distress over it all. This is not an easy time for me. 

I was at risk of getting evicted and didn’t know what to do, so I made a GoFundMe page, tucked my tail between my legs and asked for help. Well I guess I’m a really lucky girl with people who love and care about me, because I raised enough money to pay my rent. I am honored to have so many selfless people in my life. 

So a really great friend of mine passed away a couple years ago and he used to write music. His lyrics kept popping into my head today and I wanted to share them. They helped me, maybe they’ll help you too... 

“Life will always come with a punch, don’t give up no matter the weather. Let the licks roll right off you, remain as light as a feather with skin thick and strong as leather - I promise, it will get better!” 

And on that note, I’ll end with my usual farewell...

I was homeless, living in a tent.. panhandling everyday for money and food.. it was a miserable existence. I had a warrant I had been running from for a year but wanted desperately to go to rehab, tho I knew they would turn me over to the cops once my detox was over.. I prayed day and night for a way out but figured He wasnt listening cuz every time I received help I  the past,  I'd run cuz I honestly just wasn't finished.. apparently my prayers for heard cuz on December 23, 2017, He (my higher power) decided I needed a push I'm the right direction, LITERALLY!!  I fell and broke my leg, was so malnourished I broke the neck part of femur.. God did for me what I couldn't do for myself and he literally took my ability to run away from me.. I was in a wheelchair for 6 months and had to learn to walk again.. and I can honestly say if that had not happened, I'd still be on the streets or more than likely, dead..

I have relapsed twice in the last 2 years, once on a day binge of crack and once I took a few Xanax over a course of a week.. but I'm sitting at 10 months clean now.. I'm in an excellent outpatient program who I've been working with for a year.. they are housing me until I finish my college courses next May.. I'm in college to be an Alcohol and Drug Counselor.. I should have my trainee license by May of 2020

I'm not saying all of this to brag.. I'm sharing this because if I can be delivered from the depths of hell, the miserable existence I called life, to where I'm at today, I absolutely know anyone can do it.. it's hard, it's uncomfortable, everyday is not always a good day.. but it's friggin worth it.. being able to wake up and not be dope sick is a good feeling.. knowing I got clean clothes and a shower, I got food to eat, and above all I got a warm bed to sleep in.. no more freezing cold day and nights, no more standing in the rain and snow begging for money, hair frozen to my jacket and fingers and toes so numb I can't feel em.. and the best part about my sobriety, my family gets a peaceful night sleep.. they don't have to worry whether they're gonna receive that ultimate call and have to claim my body.. they can rest easy knowing I'm safe.. and my goal is to help others who feels all is lost, that there's no way out, to help them get to the other side, and feel the joy of recovery.. too many lives are lost to this horrible disease.. these addicts need to know there is another way.. they need to see that it's possible.. they need ppl to care for them when everyone else has given up.. I care!! I've been there!! And I'll help them get there too, God willing.. ❤️❤️❤️",13
2019-12-12 17:22:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/e9uoa3/nine_years_today/,Nine Years Today,"Nine years ago today (12 Dec 2010), I finally admitted to myself that I had a problem with drugs & alcohol that I simply could not tackle on my own. I hated myself. I hated my life. I saw no way out.

I reached out for help, and there were many hands there to take mine. The first four years of my sobriety, I was heavily involved with Alcoholics Anonymous. In AA, I found not only a framework to help get me sober, but also fellowship and support from people that were struggling with the same problems as me. I also found fellowship in an AA-related group called the Wharf Rats, a group of sober Dead Heads and other concert-goers that help to give each other tracion in otherwise slippery environments.

About five years ago I began drifting away from regular AA meetings, though I still attend occasionally. In order to stay sober, however, I still hold certain principles I learned from the 12 Steps very close: Honesty, Integrity, and Humility/Gratitude. Every action I take and decision I make in my life today is informed by those three things, all of which begin with myself:

1. I am Honest with myself about my needs, desires, hopes, dreams, fears, etc.
2. Integrity keeps me from hating myself because I do what I say I will do.
3. Humility and Gratitude stand together for me because so long as I am Humble enough to recognize that I don't deserve the people and things in my life I am Grateful to have them.

Getting and staying sober is the single greatest decision I have ever made. Today, I live a life better than anything I could have possibly imagined. If you or someone you know thinks they have a problem with drugs and/or alcohol, please reach out. There will always be a hand there to take yours. <3",73

On naltrexone and doing well. When I tried to drink on it it didn’t work. But after IOP I go to this amazing job I have and adore.  The routine is keeping me sober and happy. I don’t have times for meetings now. And I am feeling without meetings better. I don’t like how I am being nagged on by people in the rooms. Yes AA does work but real concrete help does. I will still use AA when I am out of treatment but that’s months away. I am getting enough of recovery support six days a week in out patient I look forward too work and enjoy it. IOP is IOP and they make sure your doing well. My sponsor got mad I haven’t been to a meeting. It’s just that the people who have reached out to be when I had my relapse are ones not from AA. I just feel that AA is great but if you aren’t 100 percent on their wave length and you look at other treatment options your crazy.  I know it’s a problem that has a spiritual basis. But also let’s look at the current research our bodies process alcohol different we are wired differently. I need a program that enconpasses both. Thoughts? Also the entire sponsor sponsee thing annoys me. Also I find some of the advice dangerous. I am a trained therapist and have an MPH certified pharmacy tech and just got into pharmacy school. So I know my meds and stuff. Someone said taking  naltrexone and adhd meds wasn’t sober and I should stop them. Now if I was an idiot I would stop.  I’m starting to find faults in the program.  I like research cutting edge medicine. Yes it helps but sharing war stories annoys me. That’s a part of my life I want to forgot. The big book is great but I feel it’s repetitive. I also don’t like to force myself to check in w a sponsor and work steps. I have resentments towards people but I can work that out with my psychiatrist and therapist I see weekly.  I believe in God but he will not remove my faults I’m beautiful with them. Character defects are a horrid term those quirks are who we are as humans. I will not change myself I will not tone down. I will continue to be me but sober. Not dating in the first year ever see my man.... he’s been there through hell and back and picked the pieces up. My parents tell them nothing so whet you want. Well sorry my parents paid my bills gave me money when they knew I was stealing from them. Now if they require me to turn over part of my paycheck show receipts and stuff and share my location that
Makes sense keeps me honest. My mom called my IOP to make sure I went on the first day.  Sorry but we are addicts and to me it may sound like control but it means they care. The fact they can tell me they hate me sometimes and I can take it. AA would say where your fault or your parents don’t understand. Well too bad they went I to their home equity line to give me money.... and if I have to turn my paychecks over to my dad to help me manage my bills. Well sorry their letting me live rent free that’s a plus.  Yes I hang out with friends who aren’t sober omg. I can’t drink doesn’t mean they can’t.  They have been there before anyone from AA. My friend doug who drinks more than a pirate has been my rock, salvation. Him and his wife calling me multiple times a day texting me and making me laugh.  My ex husband has been a rock. My friends from my first job at cvs have been rocks. My new co worker Cindy omg... rocks. People have come out of the woodwork. Friends from IOP no one from AA except the two who are in IOP w me have reached out.  Oh come to meetings I am in IOP so. Days a week and work six took sorry but sitting in a room with people like me who I know still drink and claim 45 years sobriety isn’t a goos idea. I will go to AA when I get out of IOP but IOP is at least six months.  IOP saved me meds saved me. 
Do not get me wrong I love AA and what it stands for. But when people judge me because of my choices in life I don’t like that. I found myself lying in AA to keep people happy. Isn’t that something I wanna get rid off? Also my so called best friend from the rooms dumped me as soon as I er t into IOP. Now my friends who have been there for years through sober not sober sober drink ok whatever. I worked with these people spent hours with them am dating one of them. I blamed my relapse on him. My relapse was my fault no one else’s. It was a culmination of shit. Anyway he got me the job he’s been keeping after me I had no idea he tried to show up at the rehab where I detoxed and they turned him away cause I was t allowed visitors. He’s giving me space but has been there. He got me the job I have now, now call that a toxic influence. I smoke yes I do, I wanna quit but I picked up smoking in the rooms cause thats what you do. I wanna move forward I don’t need reminders of my old life I got HPV, debt and banned from a good bar cause of it. By not gong to meeting I am getting my relationship with my parents and dog back.

I’m not okay. I’m sick. I can’t get it together. I destroy everything when I’m drunk. I become a monster that I don’t recognize and say terrible things to innocent people. I sabotage my life and put myself in dangerous situations with strangers, I blow money with no concern for my future, and I raise hell until they kick me out. If that’s what the rest of my life looks like, I don’t want to live. 

I’m desperately clinging to sobriety right now because I will die if I don’t get sober. I’ve told that to a couple people, and it’s true. I will end up face down in a gutter somewhere, raped/murdered, overdose, or slit my wrists too deep. That is what alcohol does to me. 

I’m living with so much darkness inside of me right now and it’s eating me alive. I just want to get well. If I’m never going to get well, then I wish someone would just put me out of my misery.

I guess you could call me an alcoholic of sorts. However, I live a decent live, have a professional job, no debt, no outstanding responsibilities that I don't get done.

Anyway, I don't drink often, maybe once a week or so (Maybe this is a lot to drink, IDK).  When I DO drink I drank A LOT, like at least a 6 pack of beer, or if I have a 12 pack, then I will occasionally finish the entire 12 pack. I've noticed that after about a week of not drinking I get really bad mental cravings to drink, even though I know it's not in my best interest just due to all of alcohol's negative effects on my body. Now I normally don't do anything bad or stuff I regret as I will just drink at home and play video games or something sedentary. Though my body ALWAYS feels it the next day, and my mind/brain feels it for even longer... Depression, guilt, etc. 

I just know if I gave up alcohol COMPLETELY that I would be better off overall, however my brain always has intense cravings after about a week or maybe less of not consuming alcohol. Just last night I drank an entire 6 pack, and although I don't feel hungover or sick, I know it wasn't good for me to do this. 

I just don't know what to do to overcome the cravings I feel... Does anyone have any advice or pointers or even good books to help me? I don't think AA would ever help me because I don't consider myself a TYPICAL alcoholic (whatever that means) I know that if I give up alcohol, its going to be due to me on my own free will. 

Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this, have a great day.",2

This was Feb. 3, 2018.  I have been able to maintain my sobriety for a little over 22 months now.  I rent a room, I have just landed my first sales job (which I love), my father cosigned on a vehicle loan, and I am in a quasi healthy relationship.  I have two children whom live in Indiana ages 12 and 11.

I am missing my kids a lot right now and besides fear of the unknown, I am running out of excuses for not moving back.  Indiana was never on my list of places to live and the relationship between the mother and I hasn't always been great, to say the least.  I'm not sure if it's the holidays, that show Atypical on Netflix (my son is high functioning autistic), or if I'm just aligning what's important in my life.

I have a new girlfriend, but am not sure that that relationship is solid enough or should even weigh at all on my decision to move back.  The move wouldn't happen today or next week and would require some level of planning, I suppose.  I would want to find employment, establish a place to live, and figure out how and where to develop healthy relationships with new people, but I'm scared to death over making this move, or even entertaining it.

I've developed some really amazing and healthy relationships here the past almost two years.  This life has become comfortable and I love being here.  I've also only ever been sober here.  I have a strong support group.  I also, am just fighting within my own head.

If I could make enough money to just fly back whenever I wanted, perhaps that'd be okay, but I'm beginning to feel like I need to just be with them as much as humanly possible.  What if I get home and it's a shit show?  What if it isn't what the children need?  Maybe everyone is better with me here?  It feels selfish to stay.  It feels selfish to leave.

If anyone has had a similar experience or dealt with same mental back and forth, I'd appreciate any advice or coping mechanisms. Stories from people that have come out on the other side of this and the appropriate steps to take to resolve this

Are we not playing with people's sobriety when we do this in a meeting, particularly to a vulnerable newcomer who might otherwise give the program a try if it was not for this kind of BS. Also, please note this is not a commentary on the lords prayer, which may be a profound and helpful way to conceptualize HP for ""some"" people. But rather, a question of losing sight of making AA applicable to as wide an audience as possible, thus fulfilling what we say is our primary purpose, to carry the message of recovery to the still suffering alcoholic.

Edit/update: Amazing!!! I want thank everyone who read and commented. I really appreciate the feedback and its helpful to know that I am not alone. Thank you!!",27

I went from a casual drinker to getting drunk five nights a week and snorting a bag and a half of coke each night. The other night I had an incredibly embarrassing night where I was out and just making a fucking fool of myself, shit that could get me into major trouble. I woke up the next day at six in the evening feeling so incredibly ashamed of myself I felt sick. I'm a smart person but coke and alcohol make me this raging idiot and it makes me sick. 

People who love me have been scared because they see this pattern as me trying to slowly kill myself. And honestly, the amount I've been using and how accessible it's been, I know if I keep going I'm setting myself up for an OD. 

But weirdly enough today I had a clear day. Last night I only had three beers at home over about four hours (when my last average has been 8-10 drinks in a night, and I'm a small girl). I don't know what it was that just me being embarrassed to show my face in the usual places I've been pulling this shit gave me a real wake up call. I was really depressed, and felt like shit, but it was the first time I actually sat with those feelings and reflected on them instead of numbing myself up with booze and drugs. And I'm feeling more okay. I made art and played music. I reconnected with old friends who were actually good for me. 

I don't know if today will be a new pattern, but it felt good.",3

&#x200B;

My housemate is a self professed alcoholic. They've tried to quit before and made it a full month before relapsing. They are ostensibly still trying to quit, but I know they've been drinking tequila in the basement multiple nights a week. How can I best support them? What can I do to help make this easier for them and make this house a supportive environment for them to quit drinking?",5

I've been seriously addicted to dissociative drugs since I was \~19 years old and am almost 24 now. Particularly DXM and Nitrous were my fav, but Nitrous is too expensive so eventually I started huffing air duster pretty consistently since the age of 21. More so within the past 18 months. I could easily polish off 50+ cans in a 48 hour period of time .. that's how serious this addiction is for me. I always wished that I could just stick with DXM even though that's bad for me too, because dissociatives are so useful for depression and anxiety. Problem is that once I put any drug in my body, I immediately crave duster, which in my opinion, has one of the most powerful highs out there. I hate how readily available it is and how cheap it is ($12 for a 4 pack ..) But hopefully this is my time to shine guys. Idk if anyone else struggles with addiction to duster like me but you ain't alone. We can do this together.",13

Painkillers and speed. I am clean from those and have put a lot of hard work into that process and becoming a healthier person. I definitely still struggle and have days where all I want to do is use, but I'm making better choices. 

I've also stopped marijuana, even though I didn't really struggle with it, because I decided I didn't want to take the risk of losing my job if they ever pulled me aside for a drug test. 

The thing is, I still drink. Not very often, not even weekly, but occasionally. I don't have to worry about it affecting my job, because alcohol is so socially accepted. I didn't drink a lot before getting into drugs and I dont drink a lot now, but I never cut it out. I don't really feel like I have a problem with drinking the way I had a problem with drugs, but I do feel a lot of shame over it because it feels like the recovery community expects total sobriety. 

Are there other people out there who struggled with a specific substance, and worked to overcome that without feeling the need to go completely sober? What's your story and how did you arrive at that decision being okay for you?",36

“…in silence might be the privilege of the strong, but it was certainly a danger to the weak. For the things I was prompted to keep silent about were nearly always the things I was ashamed of, which would have been far better aired…”

—Joanna Field

It has been said, “We are only as sick as the secrets we keep.” Our emotional health as recovering people is hindered, perhaps even jeopardized, each time we hold something within that we need to talk over with others.

Sharing our fears, our hurts, our anger, keeps open our channel to God. Secrets clutter our mind, preventing the stillness within where our prayers find answers. Secrets keep us stuck. Our health, emotional and spiritual, depends on our commitment to shared experiences.

Every secret we have and tell someone, frees that person also to be themselves and to grow. Sharing experiences relieves us of our shame and invites the forgiveness we must allow ourselves.

Steps Four and Five facilitate the process of sharing those secrets that block our path to God and to one another. Never can we be fully at peace with secrets left untold. Self-revelation cleanses the soul and offers us life.

I will be alert to the opportunities to share myself and cherish the freedom offered.",14
