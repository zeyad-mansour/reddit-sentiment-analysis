I started using in my teens and was actively using for over 15 years.  I’ve been on and off every mind altering drug I can think of. To sum it up, I’m a drug addict. 

5 or six years ago I started making attempts to get clean.  The details of my using are not so important.  I will say that 10 months ago I was in horrible shape.  I was fortunate enough to get into a treatment center and when 3 months of treatment came to an end I moved into a sober a sober living house.   It was the best thing to do at the time and I do not regret it.  

AA seems to be the center of my recovery, I also hold a position with the sober living organization that owns the house I have lived in for 7 months.  I have a job in a field that involves helping other people as well. 

I’m moving into a place by myself.  I have close friends with a lot more clean time than me.  I also have an AA sponsor.  These people seem to think it will be good for me.  That living on my own will help me grow even more.   So I go to meetings. I work full time.  I also volunteer. With all that I still have days where there is down time.  When I don’t have a structured day planned I some times rest too much.  I tend to lay around and it makes me irritable and more depressed. 

What are some other things I could be doing that will help my recovery?  
Does anyone have any suggestions on things (outside of 12 step) that they did in early recovery that seemed to help them?  
This may seem like a stupid question, but what are small things I can do on a day off that might lead to having fun?

Also any advice on avoiding relapse would be helpful as well.  Thank you.",13

For me, that means 5 years of abstinence from alcohol/drugs and actively working on any other problematic behaviors that appear. This past year I've discovered my shopping need to be controlled (currently in the process), my eating/exercising needs to be looked at (still contemplating), and have QUIT Nicotine after 5 unsuccessful attempts. I have an amazing job still and a family that still supports me (although I am now COMPLETELY financially independent). I also moved into my first apartment in over 6 years and have a home again. I was homeless before recovery.

I need to do a story post here. I will try to do one before my next year and link it. Here's my post from last year.

Got on probation for having a weed pipe on me. Did the mandatory outpatient. Started doing pills; Benzos, ambien, vicoden, fetanyl, and tried heroin, molly, acid, and mushrooms. Never spent a penny on the pills. I stole them from my mom, who was prescribed them for pain. Blacked out often when I took benzos, and the last time was when I blacked out at my grandmas and the cops came because my friend was passed out outside. I got grounded and went to intake for an eval and they recommended inpatient adolescence. Did that no problem at all. Have been clean for 7 years, to this day. Went to NA, AA for the first couple years and everyday. Started college, and stopped going as there was no meetings in my college town, and no vehicle. Point is, hearing people speak in meetings, They are all way worse then me. I’m the youngest longest clean person in a county of over 300k people. Was I young and a dumb teenager that hung around with the wrong crowd? I have grown so much since, that my brain wasn’t even developed all the way. I was thinking about drinking socially, because drinking is legal, socially acceptable, socially inducing, and I’m fucking 22 years old and feel like I’m throwing away the prime of my life. Can’t hang out with friends at a bar because who wants to invite the sober kid? Thoughts?",2
2020-08-30 00:39:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ij6yvp/97_days/,97 days,"This is the longest I’ve ever been sober. I had to clean out my storage unit today. I got it during what was probably the most heavy-use period of my life, maybe. That’s up for debate. 

Anyway, I’ve left that storage unit pretty much untouched since then, except to shove a few things in there over the last five years (almost to the day) without looking into the depths of it. In a lot of ways, it’s a bit of a time capsule. Shit I didn’t deal with or process that I hid away in there because I was using all the time and incapable of really processing anything. All the layers of trauma I’ve accumulated. 

But, today, more than 3 months clean, as I combed through everything, trying to decide what to trash and what to keep, I became overwhelmed. I felt like I was neck deep in grief and wreckage.

I got a lot of clarity about all the ways in which I didn’t show up for the people in my life who cared about me most. Every box I opened unearthed more evidence that being close with me didn’t yield a lot of return on their investment. 

My addiction stole my attention and care away, and I let it. I found unsent thank-you notes, the most painful being the one I wrote but never mailed to my grandmother who has since passed. 

I found scrapbooks my best friends made me for my wedding—a marriage that is now defunct. It was never meant to be, and I stumbled into it because I was never sober, neither was he, and I was grieving the somewhat sudden death of my twin brother. But I realized I never fully grieved the end of the marriage, either. I just kept numbing out, even though that never worked. 

I had to go through a lot of my brother’s stuff, too. Found his death certificate. He was also an addict, but it was cancer that took him. I don’t think those two facts are wholly unrelated, though, somehow. 

I dunno. It was just a lot. It’s all a lot these days, it seems. 

I felt overwhelmed today and had to step away. Didn’t have enough time to fully process it all. Got about halfway through the stuff in there, though. 

Been feeling triggered to use lately, and I think I may have been white-knuckling for a while. Some days are harder than others. But I’m still sober tonight, and I have my higher power to thank. 

I haven’t been going to meetings for a while, even before covid, and I stalled in working the steps after 3. I try to work the first three every day. Some days more successfully than others. One day at a time. Sometimes just one breath at a time. 

I feel like it’s time to get back in and find a sponsor to help guide me through 4. I have a lot of pain over my past, but it’s more sadness than shame. Some guilt, sure. Grief. I want to make amends when it’s right, to those with whom I still can. But I just had to share while the thoughts and feelings were still fresh.

EDIT: thanks for the replies. I deeply appreciate the support and encouragement. 98 days now :-). Gonna find some zoom meetings this week.",52

I'm in day 3 and writing seems to be helping get some stuff outta my head, but I also feel compelled to share it. I don't know if this is just attention grabbing, which I don't want it to be, it what. I really just want to share my story. 
So here it is:

This morning I'm glad I didn't drink last night, but I still woke up feeling a bit bad. Stayed in bed for longer than I should of that's okay it's the weekend. I know my ex and her bf are taking my daughter's on a bike ride this morning and I'm not really invited I feel so alone in this house by myself. 

Brush it off things will get better, I tell myself. 

I make some breakfast and coffee while cleaning the dishes from last night remembering when I had a family but took it for granted. I use to have a routine, a reason to keep going to keep working now it's just me. 

It's okay, you'll get through this, I tell myself. 

I sit down to read a book with my breakfast on a chair I picked out with my mom, who I lost a year ago, and look around at all her books, her art, her trinkets from many years of collection. I feel the want to get rid of em but I can't seem to get up to do it. 

This pain will pass, just keep going, I tell myself. 

But it's harder now. I don't have that emotional numbing agent that has gotten me this far. The hardest part is the stillness. The times it's quiet and it's just me. Me and my mind that reminds me of every mistake I've ever made, of every harsh word I unjustly spoke, of everytime I made a decision that pushed everyone away which led me to this point. 

Instead of a bottle I have my pain. Instead of a hangover in the morning I have the heaviness in my heart. Instead of being able to feel nothing i feel the dry grip in my chest of my own mistakes. 


I ruminate on how hard this is, then I remember how hard that second night was. The cold sweats. The headache. The physical need to take another drink. My body willing me to destroy it because it has been chemically changed to. 

I make the decision again. For right now. For today.

To help with that, I’ll post here weekly.

Previous Post(s):

[Week #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ie2rwm/creating_accountability/)

———

Week 2! I can’t believe I’ve been home 2 weeks and its been a rollercoaster. My boundaries have been tested, I’ve had to deal with rejection, and overall a lot of change. I’m happy and proud to say that I’ve come out of each of those situations a better person who has learned something. 

I think I’ll try and focus on a topic that describes my week and this week it’s pathways of thinking. When we learn these new tools to aide us in a life of recovery, it’s hard to think that you’ll use them. Like, for me, I’ll say “That’s cool and sounds ideal, but can I even do that?” and I am. My thinking has changed and even when I find myself slipping into my usual routes of thinking, my brain has started throwing up alarms that I’m doing the usual and need to fix it. 

I was met with a lot of testing situations this week and I’m so happy that my brain didn’t fail me. It didn’t allow me to do the usual when my boundaries were tested. Before rehab and sobriety, I’d just say “Whatever.” And let people do what they wanted. I didn’t want the confrontation. I didn’t want to feel those emotions of making things uncomfortable. But now, my brain says “These are my boundaries and whether you like it or not, they’re staying. I am worth it to enforce it.” When I say “No” I don’t get flitter of anxiety that I’m going to make the other person mad at me, I feel great because my heart knows that I deserve to be treated as a human and not a walking mat.

Another pathway created for me is that I’ve been able to criticize myself more but not harshly. The facilitators at the rehab I went to said that as addicts, we get an advantage to non-addicts. We’re given tools that allow us actively take a moral inventory of ourselves and reflect on it daily. I actively think of when I’ve taken it too far, when I didn’t show grace to others that I give myself, when I expect too much in such a little side, etc. It’s still foreign, but it feels good to have that constantly on my mind because it allows me to constantly review my actions and thought process and act on changes when my behavior is not align with my recovery.

That’s all I really have and I hope y’all have an amazing and sober weekend. 🥰",7

I’m just over 30 days sober from all drugs and alcohol! I’m so excited about this little achievement, but I didn’t know where to share it. I’m a college student and most of the people around me don’t really understand what I’ve been dealing with. My friends are as supportive as they know how to be, but I think talking about recovery makes them uncomfortable. They want to be young and carefree and I totally get that- I just don’t want to bum anybody out y’know?

I’ve been going to treatment three days a week and I can honestly say I feel so comfortable there. For the first time I feel like I can talk about my issues without judgment, and when I’m feeling triggered I know I have a safety net. There have been some hard days, and I know there’ll be more to come, but I’m more hopeful than I’ve been in a long time.

How do people deal with traumatic memories? Does talking about this even help? I have a therapist and friends who I can talk to but fail to see the benefit of telling a friend any gruesome details but those are memories that keep me up. I had my 19 yr old cat die recently and my mind automatically went to my last overdose and how she laid next to me until I came to. Covered in vomit I choked on and all the fun memories leading up to taking that leap. 

Thinking about it doesn’t help. Or at least it just winds up my anxiety to dangerous levels. Talking to my therapist works okay some days and not others. I’ve looked in to EMDR but haven’t tried it. I cleaned up as much if my life as I can and still end up a crying psychotic mess. I stopped drinking 14 mo ago but the crazy didn’t stop.

When he gets 1 comment or subscriber he goes through the roof with excitement and encouragement. I'm going to post the link in case anyone would like to look and maybe relate (and bring him a little joy and encouragement) however...

The main point of this post is that with bigger numbers and visibility also comes trolls. Does anyone have any advice on how to help him when someone inevitably leaves a nasty comment? I believe that he will be crushed when that happens. He's super fragile rn .

Thank you for reading.

The past few days I've been having some trouble and don't know if I've made the right choices. 

I have been in recovery for a little over a year. I was self medicating pain and mental health issues for 10 years before that. I am going to the suboxone clinic and trying to work the steps. I don't have a sponsor and have been doing virtual meetings because of Covid.

So I work at a gas station and we are short handed. I have trained so many people in the last month and only 1 has stuck. And she still isn't ready to be on her own. Last week my boss had me train a girl named Becca(fake names). She had experience, picked up the register great and I thought we finally found someone to work out. Then after 2 days she just didn't show up for her shift. When she did come in after a few days asking about her check for the 2 days she said 'a bunch of personal stuff' happened. 

So 2 days ago my boss tells me he hired another girl named Annie. I could tell she was nervous but right off the bat she was standing really close to me and kept pulling her mask down to talk to me. I don't like people in my bubble even if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic. Becca happened to come in that day asking about her check. Annie sees her and asks if she works there. I say no. She says good because if she did Annie couldn't. She goes on to tell me that they were best friends and their kids were too. (She told me she just got her 12 year old son back already and had a 21 year old son but didn't mention a daughter when we were telling each other about our kids so I thought it was weird she didn't mention the daughter at first) and that Becca's daughter jumped hers and they have a court case. I'm already thinking drama, great. She had already called her 21 year old son to make sure he wasn't in a random car that drove by. This was in the first 2 hours she was there. She goes on to tell me that Becca is a meth head. I made a comment that even when I was deep in addiction I still at least called because I didn't want to lose my ~~drug money~~ job but I'm in recovery now. Annie says she is too, that she goes to the suboxone clinic. I'm thinking ok. I was already getting bad feelings off her because it seemed like she was tweaking. So I kinda kept it in mind and thought maybe she's just nervous and I need to give her a break cuz she might be in the same situation as me. Trying really hard to get better and fix my life.

My boss pulls me aside and asks how she's doing. I tell him she's picking up the register good but I don't know. I keep getting a weird feeling off her and it might be a personality clash. He says that Becca told him she's a thief. 

Well the rest of the day it just kept getting worse. She like had no impulse control at all. She kept getting really close and touching me! She'd grab my arm, leaned down to pick something up and grabbed my leg. She was acting all touchy like we were longtime friends and wouldn't take the hint when I backed up. Then she asks to move her car and when she walks back in she drops her keys in my purse. She says ""My keys are in your purse"" like it's normal or on purpose. So I reach down to get them out and she kinda grabs them and puts them to the side saying ""Oh it's OK"". Like no it's not. WTF? Then she goes on a cigarette break and this guy that looked like a dealer comes up and exchanges numbers with her. She comes in and says "" I really hope he calls me"" and gives me a look like I should know what she's talking about. That was so triggering because I used to buy at work, at that store and I can't be around it again. Even though I told her she was focusing on register she wanted to be attached to me. I'd do something and she'd want to do it with me. She kept taking trash out of my hands when I was opening stuff to put up and trying to do everything for me. Like she couldn't control herself. I started pulling a trash bag out of the can and she grabs it trying to do it with me. Things that are 1 person jobs, shes like holding my hands trying to do it too. She was just going so quick and seemed high. 

I told my boss everything and said it could be a personality clash but I really thing she was high and he saw her grabbing my arm and putting her keys in my purse. So I didn't think he was going to call her back. But he's a jokester so I didn't realize the next day when he said ""your best friend will be here soon"" that he was serious.

When she walked in the next day I gave my boss a horrible look and started panicking kinda. I just couldn't' help but feeling so uncomfortable and like I was at risk. I was getting close to a panic attack every time she came close to me. Being around someone obviously abusing their script scares me. I was visibly uncomfortable. Even though I trained her the day before he did put her on a different job so she wouldn't be around me. He told her what to do. But while I had a huge rush and waiting on customers she walked right by the boss, behind the register, got so close to me her hip was almost touching mine, touched my side and pulled her mask down to ask me a question about what she was supposed to be doing. She did it a few times, always walking right by the boss who she's supposed to go to and coming to me while I was busy. My bosses mom saw that I was upset and asked me if I was ok. I told her that that girl was really making me uncomfortable. I don't have a good feeling about her at all. About 10 minutes later my boss sent her home. He told me he won't call her back. I think his mom told him to send her home before I end up leaving. 

I don't know if I did the right thing. I do know I should have told her to back off, I just always freeze in the moment. (who touches people they just met? At work? in the middle of a pandemic?) But I feel like I cost her the job. I know my bosses saw the signs and how she was acting. but they probably would have given more time to calm down and get used to the job if I wasn't so vocal about her making me uncomfortable. I feel like she could set my recovery back because I haven't been around anyone still acting like an addict since I started treatment. But I feel guilty.

Sorry this was so long and might be in the wrong place. I just didn't know where else to put it and hoped people here would understand with the addiction and the suboxone being in the mix.",2

I really want to create more accountability with my recovery. Its been a week and a day since I've been home from rehab and while I've made sure I've been active, I haven't taken a day to just focus on my recovery. So, I'm going to try my best to make a weekly post here so I can stay connected in the community and make sure I keep talking about it because I know complacency is an enemy to recovery and I want to assure that I keep my recovery at the forefront of my life.  
\-----

To start off, my D.O.C. is alcohol and marijuana and there have been times that I have abused pain pills when prescribed. On top of that, my addiction exacerbates my (undiagnosed, but currently being looked into with my new therapist) compulsive sexual behaviors (that's another story for another time). It's amazing how in active addition, you have this dual mind. One part of your mind is telling you that you're going to crash burn. How you're living life is not okay and your actions will catch up to you. The other part, which is some how the loudest, tells you nothing has happened yet and you're still alive. Why fix what isn't broken? Fresh out of rehab, I think back on the last 10-12 years of my life with a new perspective I gained and I just think why couldn't I just stop and get help when I had those moments of clarity that I spiraling out of control. But, addiction is the disease that tells you that you don't have a disease and I've never heard truer words spoken. 

I know that there is nothing I can do to change the past and I've accepted that. I've luckily come out of treatment feeling hopeful for my future and for the first time in a long time (if ever) I feel confident in that hopefulness. My addiction and behaviors have hurt people, which is something I never wanted in my life. Now, it's my responsibility to take what I've learned and heal myself so I can properly make amends and live a better life that I know I deserve and can achieve. It's inundating to say the least. My brain fights everyday to use the new paths of thinkings I've created. I want things now now now. But this is a process and a practice and it'll just take time. I'm scared I'm going to forget. I'm scared I'm going to become complacent. I'm scared that this moment is only temporary. I'm scared I'm not doing enough. As long as I'm being authentic, surrendering the outcome, and doing the uncomfortable work (Ty Michael Brody-Waite) I'll know I'm taking steps in the right direction. Feeling and processing my emotions, taking ownership of my actions, and letting go of resentment is so much y'all. Fuck.",5

August 12

""I remember my divorced parents stealing two o thee of us five kids in the middle of the night. I was left behind, hiding in waiting as if death would find me. I was petrified, away from the others having to play a game that wasn't funny. I grew up terrified of the unknown, my antenna always on high alert, sensing my surroundings for imminent threats from people, places and things.  Sleep was almost impossible. I was convinced someone was out to get me.

Alcohol worked well to calm the fear and perpetual panic that rose and threatened to strangle me. It provided a false sense of security. Years of professional intervention along with recovery helped to quell my fears.

Today I know feelings are NOT facts and that what I imagine does not influence my reality. Today, I am no longer afraid.

I embrace the darkness and trust what while I cannnot see, I KNOW I am not alone. I am so grateful the steps have changed my thoughs and actions.

Today's Meditations: Today I am relieved to not know what is to come. My God is in control. I am powerless, and I like it that way.

(rant)","I went to rehab 3 years ago, had a couple relapses but since then I've been striven and working hard to stay on the right track. I'm bipolar and I feel embarassed to say it but my drug of choice was weed mixed with my antipsychotics. Since getting clean my fix has been this involuntary obsessive attatchment to other people, and I think its since I haven't been in a relationship since my partner broke up with me when I got out of rehab. 

Im perscribed Klonopin to help with anxiety, but I've known to stay away from it because I know I could get reliant on it. its hard to explain and it probably sounds bad, but I recently reconnected with one of my friends from rehab and he abuses Klonopin, which has made me kind of jealous that he isn't in recovery and still gets to have fun... I'm attracted to him   
 and its made me start to compromise whatever I'm doing to get close to him again. 

I've been doing all the healthy coping mechanisms, making smart choices, staying on my psych meds, and my life has just become boring playing everything safe. Recently I've been pretty unstable and I've been fanticising about going back to rehab and having other people do the dirty work for me. Being destructive and putting myself in danger and getting into trouble was fun and exciting, and I miss that. being with bad influences was my type of community and ""safe haven"" for lack of a better word. I feel like I want to go to a meeting, they really helped me back in rehab, but I feel embarassed that I might not fit in or be worthy because I haven't actually started abusing anything again yet, just fantacising over it and I'm looking for someone to stop me. 

I manipulated my psychiatrist into perscribing me more Klonopin and giving me the reccomendation to take it daily, Ive been recogniing that I need help and I've been asking people for advice (leaving out the desire to abuse again) but I know it all comes down to self control, which I don't have any desire to have.",3

I tried to stop drinking this week...I lasted two days,I was shaking all over,hallucinating,anxious (when I say anxious I mean like if someone was about to kill me anxious!) agitated,sleeping and eating was out of the question,and the cravings my God they were like being held under water and your body screaming for you to breath.  I gave in when I started to think I might have another seizure I'm prone to withdrawal seizures I've had 31 to date,I know your going to say go to your G.P/Doctor for help but every single time I do I get the same response ""we don't treat addiction"" in fact last time I went there with my alcohol worker looking for help  the DR. Was quite rude and said ""how many more times have I got to tell you! We don't deal with addiction! Don't come here again about it""
  I feel so guilty that I did give in again to alcohol but the withdrawal symptoms were getting really scary, I found it so difficult just to go them two days, then I hear of people going 100 days and it just seemed impossible to me. I feel trapped,alcohol has such a hold on me. I sometimes wonder how the Hell on earth is this stuff legal? It's one of the few drugs that the withdrawal can kill you from.
So my new plan is taper down and try again, the problem isn't helped that I live with a alcoholic (my mother) and a borderline alcoholic and heavy binge drinker (my father) 

Anyone had success at tapering off alcohol?
I'm drinking about 20 units a day

Please,"It took alot for my boyfriend to write this, so I helped him, and I hope someone can give some advice or just a read, is all I ask. This is his story....

I was born in California, and me and my family moved to NY when I was barely a year old. My family being my grandparents, their 3 children (my mom and 2 uncles) and myself. My dad was killed before we moved...he was only 16. I wish he was here til this very day, and maybe my life wouldnt be as fucked up as it is. But I cant blame anyone but myself for my actions.

Anyway, I was basically raised by my grandparents up until my younger teens and my grandmother played a very important role in my life. So did my grandfather. Not saying my mother or uncles didnt but my grandparents raised me basically.

I grew up in a small decent town. Always was told I was smart and hung out with the older crowd. Was a quiet kid. I dropped out in 11th grade and got my GED. Why? Dont ask me...a couple of my good friends had dropped out at the time and I think I wanted to follow them. Probably one of the first big mistakes of my life. I dont know why I dropped out, I never failed a grade or anything at that point in life, and actually was blessed to be very smart and could of basically successfully taken any route in life I put my mind to. But instead I dropped out and started running the streets thinking it was cool at the time. Drinking, throwing parties, going to the studio (writing and making music has always been a passion) and just doing reckless teenager shit.

Out of all the friends I had, I was very close to 6 of them. 6 of those friends whom I considered brothers who always had my back as I did theirs. I started smoking weed when I was 16 and drank here and there but at the time weed was my drug of choice...

Right before my 17th birthday I tried some coke, and it became a party drug for me. I would smoke weed everyday, and drink on the weekends doing coke with friends. I was always able to keep some type of income coming in, and moved out when I was about 22 after i met the love of my life who I'm with til this very day. We had got a place in town, and not long after got a car. Life was good.

At this point in time, I started to make decisions I didnt know was going to effect me til this day, 11 years later.
Shortly after, me and her got our own place. I started selling coke to keep some money flowing when I wasnt working. She didnt necessarily approve of it, but the money I was bringing in was good. She also didnt know I was using coke, I always kept it from her because shes a mirror of me. I didnt want to see such a beautiful woman doing that type of shit. Especially the one I loved.

We were living in that place for about 2 years.

One night at the new place me and one of the 6 friends I basically considered a brother were playing dice in my kitchen with my other 5 friends. We'll call him T. Me and T were rolling dice, betting, having a good time......until the stakes got high, and tensions rose. We ended up having some words over a bet, and almost faught. We almost faught because I had him up so high, and he had still owed me $300 I let him borrow the previous week to give his son a good birthday and I just felt he was trying to get over on me. The air got thick, and I brought it up how I felt like he was trying to play me and we ended up arguing resulting in me throwing him out in front of our 5 other good friends. 10 minutes later I started to feel bad (idk why but I have a good heart even when ppl fuck me over) I called him because I was going to apologize and go pick him back up but he didnt answer. Oh well.

2 nights later....

I pulled up to the gas station to grab some gas, at about 1am. As I pulled up to the pump I noticed my mom also pulling in, parking into a parking space further from my car. As she got out and didnt notice I was at the pump I ran over to her as she was about to walk into the store.

""Hey what's up mom, what you doing out this late?""
""Oh hey, I'm just grabbing some cigarettes for tmrw, im almost out""
""Can I use your lighter"" I asked...i wanted to light my blunt i had in the car. 
""Yeah"" she says as she reaches in her pocket, looking towards her car.
""Here just buy one, I think I left mine home, I have to get going""
She handed me a 20 dollar bill and ran to her car and pulled off.
As she was pulling away I'm thinking, what the hell? That was odd.
At that point I knew something was up. But didnt know what. I shook it off.

I got gas, I left the gas station and went home.
I smoked my blunt when I got home and my phone went off...it was one of my licks (someone who was a frequent buyer). She asked if i would trade her a ball for her script of Oxy 10s. At the time I knew those sold just as good, if not better, than the coke. And the script was a 90 count. I sold balls for 150 and I knew I could sell that script for 450 if not more. That wasnt even a question for me. Told her to  bring em, I hooked her up and she she went on her way.

That following weekend I remember coming home, opening my drawer, going into my stash and doing one more line, after a long night of partying. I sat in the kitchen and finished a drink I poured as I tried to come down. I went to bed and tossed and turned, and after a night of coke and ciroc, the room kept spinning and I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went in my cupboard to get some tylenol PM when I seen the oxy bottle. I thought, you know what. I'm gunna pop one of these bad boys, I bet that will get me some sleep. Opened the bottle, slid one out, grabbed some water and swallowed one. I sat in my living room and turned on my ps3, and played COD until I felt the effects.

About 45 minutes into playing, I noticed not only did my comedown come WAY down, I felt good. Really good. Next thing you know its 9am and my girls waking me up on the couch. I had fell asleep with the controller in my hands.

At this point I started using the oxys to come down everytime I sniffed coke. And that was probably 3 times a week.

I got a phone call at about 3am later that week from one of the 6 friends I considered a brother. We're going to call him J.
J called me and was frantic. I could hear in his voice he was scared, very scared. I asked what the hell is wrong man? What's going on???? He says, ""listen me and my girl just got into a big fight. She kicked me out and now I'm walking the streets. I have no where to go and have warrants man please pick me up and let me stay over just for tonight."" I told him without a doubt, went and picked him up and let him stay in my studio.
(I had put about 7,000 towards a home studio which I had a room dedicated to which also had a twin bed off to the corner.)

Me and him went into the studio, talked about his problems, I tried to ease him, we smoked and I went to bed.

The next day I got up, went in the studio, and he was gone. I picked up the phone dialed his number, and he answered.

 ""Where did you go??"" I asked.

""I had one of these guys I know picked me up to get a couple things from my house but I'm on my way back right now, he wants to know if he can buy a ball"" he says.

""I dont know him bro, you know how we get down, I mean if you trust him, you can give it to him and just pay me but I dont know him"" I said.

""Ok I'm on the way"" he replied.
10 minutes later he shows up, I look out the window and theres like 3 ppl in the car. He got out by himself, came upstairs, I give him the ball, he gives me the money and he goes straight into the bathroom. 5 minutes go by, I knock on the bathroom door, ask if hes alright, ""yeah coming out now "" he replied. He dapped me up coming out of the bathroom, said hed be back, and left....
I didnt hear from him all day.

That night I picked my girl up from work at 11pm.
I pulled into my driveway, we both came upstairs.
""SHIT"" my girl says.
""I still have the keys for the med box on me, I need to go back and drop them off for the next shift, I'm not supposed to bring them home""
I gave her the car keys and she bolted out the door in a rush
""Be right back babe"" she says.
Not even 30 seconds after she walked out the door, there was a knock....

Not even thinking to check out the window to see who it was, I figured it was her to run back in and grab her cellphone she had forgotten, so I unlocked the dead bolt and opened the door.
Boy was I wrong....

As I opened the door, all I could remember was staring into a set of eyes behind a ski mask as he quickly began to choke me. He choked me until I literally couldnt breathe and threw me backwards, into my glass coffee table. As I laid there in broken glass, I tried to get up as quick as I can as he went for the door to shut and lock it back up when he turned around and grabbed me. We wrestled around for a couple seconds in glass and he gained a full mount on top of me, choking me again. He was saying ""dont try anything stupid or you're dead, pulled out a machete and put it to my throat. As I sat there bleeding from the glass, sweating, breathing as hard as I ever did, I stared in his as and nodded my head yes. At this point I knew I was going to die if I kept trying to fight back. So I started to comply. Remind you, I'm in sweats, my gun is under my couch cushion, and all I'm thinking is ""just work with him, get him calm, and go for the gun"". As I shook my head to imply I'm surrendering, he says, ""I just want the coke. Give me the coke and I wont kill you"" ""where is it"" he says, as hes looking towards the kitchen as if he knew it was somewhere in there. He put the machete back to my throat and says ""sit Indian style with your hands behind your back"" at this point I knew he was going to kill me, and the way he looked in the kitchen where the coke was, I thought this was someone that already knew where it was. I didnt recognize his voice, so I'm thinking someone tipped him off and this was a set up.

As soon as he ordered me to sit Indian style with my hands behind my back, I got up as quick as I could and went for my gun.

We started wrestling again.

He was much stronger than I was, and after a couple blows as he gained control, he was back in the dominant position. He told me to get on my stomach as he took his machete and put it to the back of my head as he started flipping my couch cushion. He found the gun, grabbed it, and started laughing. He cocks it back, made sure one was in the chamber, and goes ""if you try some silly shit like that again I'll blow your head off. Now stay still""

As I laid there on my stomach, he started opening closets. The second one he opened was in the hallway where I kept my towels and other miscellaneous crap. He grabbed a towel, and some clear masking tape I had in there, used his machete to cut the towel in half vertically, tied my hands behind my back, along with with my feet, all together, in a hog tie sort of style and dragged me to the kitchen. At this point I thought I was done. In my head I'm saying my prayers and started to tear up. This was my last night of my life I'm thinking.
 He found the coke, did a giant line in front of me, and put the rest in his pocket. About $800 worth I had left that he took. He then proceeded to drag me into my bedroom and started going through the closet and all my drawers. I just sat there, tied up in silence. He found a few more hundred dollars I had in the drawer along with mine and my girls ID. He knelt down and shoved my girls ID in my face. 

""Do you wanna see her ever again?"" He yells.

I yelled, ""please, just go man, you got what you came here for""

He replies, ""if she shows up right now, you know I have no choice but to kill the both of you right?""

""Just go man, please"" I uttered. Knowing her job was only 5 minutes away, and about 15 minutes had passed, I knew she was bound to show up at any second.

""PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU TO JUST LEAVE DUDE"" I implied, still hogtied, bloody, and shaking.

""I want you to count to 60, and do not get up until you count to 60. I wanna hear you count out loud. If you try any funny shit you're dead.""

""Ok, ok"" I replied.

He ran out the room as I started to count. As I got to 20, I started to get up and tried to untied myself as I was still counting when he ran back into the room suddenly and boom.....

I woke up to my girlfriend on top of me sobbing, screaming, ""WAKE UP PLEASE!!!!"" Slapping me.

I'm disoriented. Everything's a blur.
As I started to come to, my girlfriend was balling her eyes out. She started hugging me, asking me frantically what had happened. I noticed my left eye was swollen shut. My glasses were gone. And I had a lump on my temple the size of a golf ball.

He hit me, I thought to myself.

He must have hit me with something other than his fist with the damage I had to the side of my face.

""Thank you"" I kept repeating to my girlfriend. ""Thank you baby"".
She looked at me confused as hell and says, ""for what?!? What the hell happened ?!?""

""Thank you for not coming home when that happened. I just got set up and if you would of walked in that door, we both would of had a bullet with our name on it with my own gun."" I said.

I explained to her what had happened and we both decided to leave that night. Not knowing who, how or what necessarily just happened I was confused. I needed to get away and think straight.

Who did this to me? Who set me up? Why would this happen, I try to show everyone extra love with all my power who the hell would do this to me?

I had a couple things in mind, a couple people on my radar as you might have had as well reading this, but I didnt know for certain. I had to do some digging.

That night we packed and left to stay with my uncle until we could find another place.

I got a phone call not long after this had happened and it wasnt good. My grandmother....she was sick. My mom had called me and told me we were all going to her drs appointment the next day because shes getting tested and stuff for cancer.

Oh my god.
Cancer.
I immediately started praying in tears.

The next day the family went to the hospital with her.
Impatiently waiting in that room beside her bed with my mother and grandfather, as the doctor came back in. The look on his face told it all. I let out a yell from deep inside of me.

""NO, PLEASE TELL ME NO"" I yelled. 

""I'm sorry"" the doctor says. ""The mass in your lungs, is cancer'

My grandfather let out a scream I've never heard before.
""Jesus christ, please tell me different "" he says
My mother started crying her eyes out.
I couldnt believe it.
I look over at my grandmother and she was staring at the ceiling. Calm. Her eyes started to water as she looked over at us, and says ""it's okay, please stop crying, its ok""
Growing up, my grandmother has always been the strongest person I knew. And she was the calmest one in the room at that very moment.

As time went on, I moved into my grandparents and vouched to take care of her, as her health deteriorated over time, and eventually got put on hospice.

I will never forget the day she went. She was very sick that day. Kept going in and out of it, and wasnt acting normal at all. I called my mother and told her. My mother rushed over along with my uncles and sisters, and as soon as everyone sat in the living room with my grandmother in her recliner, she put her head down and passed. It's as if she was waiting for everyone to get there to go. As she put her head down the room filled with this unexplainable air. Everyone started crying, as I walked over to her, kissed her on the forehead and told her I loved her and grabbed her hand and couldnt let go as my eyes are pouring tears.

I will always remember the night before she passed. I kept a baby monitor in my room and one in hers, everytime I heard her at night struggling or anything out of the ordinary I would rush to her room and make sure she was ok. The night before she passed, I'm laying in bed and I heard her over the monitor trying her all to say something. I rushed into her room and asked if everything was okay. She looked at me and struggled to get enough air in her lungs to say, ""i.....love....you...very....much.....thank....you....baby"" I grabbed her hand and tried not to cry and told her, ""dont thank me grandma, that's what I'm here for. To make sure you're okay"" she smiled and gripped my hand tight. I kissed her on the forehead and told her I loved her. Not knowing she was going to pass that next day.

This is starting to get very hard for me to write so I'm going to wrap it up.

Basically the night I seen my mom at the gas station and she was acting weird...well I found out she was with T. Yeah, the T I called my brother growing up. I think he felt some type of way the night we fought in front of our friends, or maybe he felt embarrassed. Embarrassed to the point where he wanted revenge. They got together and are still together til this day. I beat myself up time and time again, always remembering that night we were rolling dice betting, and always say to myself, damn it, why cant you ever be more humble with people. Especially your friends, it didnt have to go down like that and you didnt have to kick him out and embarrass him in front of everyone. It's something I beat myself up about everyday. The way I get with people when I feel betrayed.

Today I have major trust issues and always have my guard up. I tend to not let anyone in anymore.

Oh....and The guy who ran up in my house....I got set up by J. My other boy I called ""brother"". I guess the day I called him after he left when he said he had a lick, that's who it was for. It was for the guy that took my pride and robbed me in my own house. The guy that ran up in my house and tied me up.

Remember when I said J went into the bathroom after i gave him the coke that day? Well he went in there to cut it. He cut the ball so bad, it was basically all fake when he went and served the guy up, and the guy pressed J about it, and J told him everything; Where my coke was, what my girls work schedule was like, etc., so this guy can plot on me and come at the right time when I was alone. He was outside the whole time waiting for me to get back home that night and when my girl left, that was his opportunity. 

I'm trying to go into as much detail as I can but this is not only a struggle to write about, but is getting long and I want this to be read. I need help.

I basically turned to what i knew at the time made me feel best, and those were the oxys. I really started abusing them until it came to the point where I either couldn't find them anymore or they were too expensive and at this point I'm withdrawaling. At which point I started sniffing heroin, and now i have a powder fentanyl habit that's high as the sky. Each and every time I get high, thinking and grieving. Wishing I could turn back time.

I can say a few things tho. Thank god I'm terrified, literally terrified of needles or i probably would have shot up a long time ago. And I thank god I'm still alive. Out of the past few years of me sniffing fentanyl, I overdosed 1 time, and if it wasnt for my girl hearing me fall on the kitchen floor at midnight waking her, I would of died on that floor that night. They had to bring me back to life that night.

I've pushed the little family I have away over this bullshit, and my life is in shambles. I've considered suicide a few times in my life throughout this hell journey but never had the balls to do it and always remind myself I'm better than this.






Today I'm currently laying down in my room in rehab. I'm 20 days clean, for the first time since I started popping oxys 5years ago. But it's hard. Very hard. I dont know what to do when I get out and I'm scared. Any words of motivation or advice would be appreciated. I know this was a long one and it was very hard to write and this probably wont get read because its so long, and probably isn't even 35% of what I've gone through in my life, but I just want to open up about this. Something I've never done as a quiet humble person. I'd need to write a book if I wrote about everything. Things that movies are made from. I'm still alive and I know it's for a reason.

If you got this far, thank you for taking the time to at least read about some of my journey and any words of advice, courage, or wisdom will be much appreciated. I lost everyone, and the only one helping me til this day is my girl and my mom. Everyone else that truly cared I pushed away during this time.

I'm lost and just want my life back. I know I'm better than this but I'm losing hope by the day.

Reminding you, this is my boyfriend of 11 years' story. He wrote it, I posted it. I help him write as well....and encouraged him to tell this story.",52

Started taking pills to cope with the trauma and pain and ended up addicted to Xanax for about a month. First time I've ever been addicted to anything. I didn't even realize I was addicted to it until I ran out of pills and had a complete meltdown, I almost admitted myself to the hospital but I got through it. I've been clean for like 3 weeks now.

In the midst of my addiction I would get completely fucked on Xans and post basically everything that was on my mind on social media. This included suicidal thoughts and other things that didn't need to be posted on social media. A lot of my friends distanced themselves from me as I was obviously unstable at the time.

I basically have only one close friend right now. I used to have 4-5 friends that would always be down to hang out. I feel like if I don't start making more friends I'm going to have another episode and relapse. 

For those here that have been clean for longer (1+ years) where and how did you make friends? How hard was it?

Looking forward to a good discussion, stay safe everyone",8
2020-08-17 00:57:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ib7tbu/feels_shallow/,Feels Shallow,"I’m freshly out of a pretty serious adderall addiction that spanned a decade. It ended because I recently experienced two very long (weeks long or more each) episodes of drug induced psychosis that razed my entire social and professional life. I’m 7 months sober aside from a beer or two a week (struggling to quit drinking entirely, but ready finally so I’m attending AA tomorrow via zoom). I’m looking for work and actively interviewing, and my mood has finally sort of stabilized (and of course, I’m back to be being sane and reasonable as I always was).

So, overall, I’m happier than I’ve ever been except for one thing: I’m (still) gaining massive amounts of weight. I know this sounds shallow and vapid, but I cannot help but feel out of control about my appearance. I *hate* all the excess fat and I can’t even look in the mirror without wanting to cry.

Am I being stupid? Please any comments are welcome—just please anyone help me get a handle on this bizarre hang up.",2

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures & reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

I have severe ocd that creates allot of anxiety.  I stopped chasing the high once I realized that you can only go so far before you black out, and don’t think the high is all that great in the first place.  I have rules about taking it two days in a row.  For the first 15 years I only had access to .25 mg so I didn’t take it allot. I am 300 pounds and it didn’t help much.  Once I got upped to 1mg I was doing well and taking 1-2mg about two or three times a week.   By the end of 2018 I legit went insane and lost it and started doing 1-2mg every 2/3/4 days.  And basically continued that regiment till recently.  So I was going through 60 1mg pills every 2/3 months.  I don’t take it before work, hanging out with friends, or if I want to focus on something like guitar or video games.  I prefer the marijuana high.  

So about a 2 weeks ago I took my last one.  I decided to delay the refill just for tolerance break.  During this time some dude totaled my 9 month old car with 7500 miles on it and my dog had a major surgery with odd pill hours to disrupt my sleep and once I’m up I’m up.  So I been on about 4/5 hours of sleep.  About a week into I started feeling funny.  Like my vision was fucked up, getting easily confused and allot of anxiety. About the car and dog.  

Throughout this time at no point did I feel like I needed more Xanax I could have gotten it any day I just didn’t feel like it.  I just want to know if this seems like a dependence.   I always thought I couldn’t be addicted if I didn’t love and crave the pills. I just used them medicinally.  So is this addiction or just the result of not sleep and normal stress.",3

I’m not stating that I’m trying to go to rehab again or wanting to. Some go once. Others go 8 times, there’s nothing wrong with either. I was just saying that it was my first time ever going to a rehab and my first time in recovery 🥰


Yesterday I left a rehab after 45 days. I drove myself there and had a fairly long car ride home. It took everything in me to not panic. Everyone kept asking if I was nervous and I truly wasn’t. This is my first go at recovery, I have no idea what to expect. If you’re a gamer, it’s like losing your new player buff in an MMO. The rehab was my shield and I hit reality hard when I realized at this point, everything is on me and that’s so much, but obviously we have to take it one day at a time (well, yesterday, it was one hour at a time 😂). The rehab I went to has an alumni program and we’re sent the zoom info so we can still join the meetings they hold nightly. It seemed like the clock was moving so slow. I just wanted to connect already and when I finally did, it was like relief. I had only been away from them all for an hour and I had missed them all already. 

The rest of the night did not go as planned and it knocked my usual routine that I started at rehab way off and I wasn’t in bed until 1:30a (but I still took my meds at least!) I focused on what I could control and it made it easy.

Today is a new day and I’m happy to have found this reddit + others. Have a great day. :)",48

The week before her funeral, my husband 'Angel' of 5 years called me in an incoherent panic. He was in a nearby city as I was staying at my brother's house. Basically, Angel attempted suicide and was taken by ambulance to the local psychiatric hospital. 

Thankfully, he safe and relatively healthy but what was revealed was that he had been using meth and GHB during PNP (party n play) for over 7 years.  Sure, there were little red flags here and there but honestly, he hid them really well (along with logical excuses,  mostly).  Two days after the suicide attempt, Angel went into a 2-month in-patient program to get the help he needed. He seemed to have truly turned a leaf. 

Fast forward to him moving back home and, voila, within 3 days he relapsed. It turns my stomach and breaks my heart that he brought people into our home & had unsafe sex with multiple strangers. Thankfully, he went right back into treatment so I am happy that he is safe and being taken care of... now, here comes the question: What in the fuck do I do? I do not know If I can go back into a relationship with someone who (a) has this addiction, which involves constant cheating and unsafe sex & (b) where the rate of frequent relapse is through the rough... oh & (e) someone who will have to relearn how to have 'sober sex' since he stopped liking that 2 years ago. 

I think I know exactly what I need to do however, I am curious if anyone out there has been in a similar situation or may have some words of encouragement.

At the time I didn’t know how to get clean, didn’t know how to get help... I just felt so alone and low I didn’t want to wake up, it’s sad to say but I was homeless, broke and hungry and completely alone. 
After fighting with all my will and might I managed to reclaim what was left of my life, and have been rebuilding ever since. 
I think a strong support network would of been so helpful at the time, and would of aided my recovery massively! 
So Im making this post to try connect with people who might be in a similar position and offer whatever help I can. 
I don’t judge I’m not here to make assumptions about anyone, I just wanna give back... I feel like it’s my duty and obligation. When I was addicted i had nowhere to turn, I don’t want other people to have to go through that! 
Even if I can help just one person I’ll be happy!

Clearly this isn't something you'd dump on someone on the first date, nor would you wait until the wedding.

Does anyone have any experience or advice on this?",7

I broke it off with him after I found out the truth of the amount of debt he'd been covering up (over $40k) and since then he's been trying hard to get me back. 

He's been working with a debt management organisation, has a new job and has started going to therapy. We've been talking very intermittently and today I agreed to meet up with him. He jumped on this and offered to take me for dinner. 

I didn't reply for some time and when I came back to my phone, he'd messaged me saying that it may be better if we rain check because he didn't really have the money available and suggested perhaps we go in a couple of weeks time after he gets paid.

I cannot describe how proud of him I am. In my mind this is wayyy better than taking me for dinner. WAY BETTER. He's not only admitted his problem but I can see an actual step. It is definitely early days, but I was shocked at receiving this message - never in a million years, did I expect it. 

So, yes, I'm super proud of him!",35

I'm about half an hour from clocking out of a decent shift, I'm a couple of hours away from being able to sleep longer than I have in a while, and I have things to look forward to. I know that for me, when things are going reasonably well, it can be easy for me to forget what I'm working towards in terms of my sobriety. Thus, I thought I'd make a post with the Serenity Prayer to help center myself, as well as to help anybody that may need to read it this morning. Maybe this post can become a ""unifyer"" of sorts.

God, grant me the serenity  
To accept the things I cannot change,  
The courage to change the things that I can,  
And the wisdom to know the difference.

I’m looking into a detox program but I’m terrified. I’ve had bad experiences with treatment. 
What will I do without cocaine? I already struggle with suicide ideation. I only look forward to doing coke. Will I go back to alcohol? My next step is a detox program, so I’m looking into that.

However, I have used it fairly regularly (2-3 times a week) since starting up at that seven-month mark. I have never picked up any other psychoactive substances post-rehab and I am well over two years clean from heroin today. 
To be clear, my marijuana use has not led me to escalate my use to any other type of substances and I am thriving IMO [got accepted to an accredited University and have maintained a 3.9 GPA for 3 semesters (intermittent marijuana use throughout)].
As an additional POI, I have recently had to stop smoking in case I get tested for upcoming internships, and I found it rather difficult to put down permanently, but I seem to have managed it nonetheless. I went to my outpatient facility yesterday and my drug screen results suggested that the marijuana will be out of my system in plenty of time to pass a pre-employment screen.
TLDR:Recovering heroin addict, clean for two years and have been using marijuana regularly for the latter 3/4ths of that period. I consider regular marijuana use to be benign in my case, and I was just wondering what RECOVERY REDDITORS’ opinions were.",3

I got engaged last year to another addict in recovery but early in our engagement he relapsed in the middle of a move from Arizona to Georgia. He refused treatment and had no intentions of seeking sobriety again so we broke off the engagement and I moved back to Arizona.

The fellowship caught me when I was down on it and life has turned back around for the better. I don't plan on moving in the very near future but I think I would still really like to move to the south, excluding Georgia. My family is southern and I feel very drawn to the south.

My only hang up is that Arizona has such a solid recovery scene, especially for young people. And while I am willing to create the fellowship I desire wherever I end up, I do want to find somewhere that is somewhat comparable. No clue how to find that information though so I thought I'd drop a post here!

So I'm not an addict myself but have been dating one off and on for just about two years. I met him when he was using meth pretty regularly. A lot of bad situations have happened through out our relationship; from him getting physical with me to him accusing me of cheating on him with his friend down to him totaling out one vehicle and causing extreme cosmetic damage to another. I did not know what I was getting into when him and I got together but it's been eye-opening. Then he was sober from meth for just about a year (did a two week stint in rehab before getting kicked out because of his mouth) until he started showing signs he was using again. I've broken things off many times due to his use, how he's treated me and my children. Then he took a turn for the worse a couple months ago and traded pain killers for heroin. He even brought home a syringe; he was too high to realize the he did that until I asked him about it. Now, I love this man. I take him back all the time because I keep riding on the hope that he hits that rock bottom and finally decides to give it all up. It's actually kind of like an ironic situation like addiction. I know relapses happen, it's part of the process. I know I can't love him harder, control him, and I know he's got to want it for himself. I just don't think he will ever fully get there. He says that he wants to, vebatim, for me, for us, and him but I don't know. There's other issues he has but I don't know if it's related to his drug use or just him. I've tried to talk to him about certain issues but he either gets pissed off or defensive, then I get hurt and angry for the things he has said, and I don't really trust what he says.

I keep thinking I'm getting better but I am realizing I'm not, I'm just doing more with less effects. Even trying tolerance breaks and limiting myself from substances...when I go back, there's not a high. 

I need to do something about myself. I need to stop using for real and figure out what drives it because up until now, I've been in 6 inpatient facilities and am able to get clean, even keep it going a few months, but I slip. I actively seek out a slip. 

It's been mentioned a lot to me from doctors, professionals, family...that I would benefit from a long term program due to my resistance and level of use. I just can't even imagine going to intake knowing I'm going for a minimum of nine months. Like wtf. After about 45 days I'm ready to start smashing windows in with bricks. 

Or keep using. I don't mind using, I just hate where it's put me. The only people that even talk to me are my parents, and they only do it under the false pretenses that I'm doing better.
