My life is so much better. I have a relationship with my HP. I get to paint and cook and smile and learn and read. It’s been amazing in every aspect of my life until I talk to someone on the phone. I live 700 miles from all of my friends and family and what I have found is that my simple way of living is boring. I am boring. The things I do have to say are jumbled in my insecure anxiety and are not well received. Not even by my mom. 

I’ve learned that I am not trusted to make good decisions in my relationship with my god. I am not trusted with information because I have loose lips. I am not interesting enough to talk to, period. I feel like I am a hollow person these days. I unpacked the bad parts of me and I only have a couple good things to fill in the space. I am happy but I am also deeply lonely. This is a direct consequence of my drinking. 

I just don’t know how to talk to people and I always feel worse getting off the phone then when I picked it up. I am lucky that I get to start over and learn how to be a person at 25 years old. This is the core reason I started drinking when I was 17 but even at 17 I was more interesting than I am now. Does/did anyone else feel like this in the beginning? 

I go to meetings 4 times a week but it’s hard to make friends via zoom. I have an amazing sponsor who reassures me it will get better. Covid is just muddying it up. 

On the bright side, I haven’t thought about picking up a drink a single time in these 79days.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who commented encouraging a relatable intentions. I’m still sober. Still dealing with negative emotions but I’m feeling better. My only job right now isn’t to be like able but to be sober so I can someday become more likeable. I really appreciate everyone that had reached out. One day at a time.",18,1

Move forward?,"I had to kick my bf out months ago bc he relapsed after his first rehab attempt and his behaviour towards me was bad. After some time I spoke with his family and we all decided to try to the tough love route with him and stop talking to him. He only got worse and started spending more time at drugs houses as none of us were letting him around us. I felt horrible about this and seeing him get worse and worse so I starting talking to him again when he reached out and informed his Mom... she started taking to him a bit as well. 

His drug problem remained bad, and because I was back in contact with him I started to see what was going on (stealing, not showering. Etc.) ... so I ended up reaching out to his step Mom and father who I’ve never been close with but who have the money to help him that his Mom and I don’t have. I never ended up talking with the Father about how bad the problem was, but I did with the step Mom and she didn’t thank me for my concern which I thought she might..., instead she went on and on about how I was enabling him and to shut the door in his face. But, at the same time his Dad finally agreed to pay for rehab... so I have mixed feelings about that entire interaction... the step Mom was angry with me for keeping in touch, but at the same time, because I did, I saw how bad things were, and thought being a stable human they’d “trust me” as they never seem to believe their son when he says it’s bad... 

Did I listen? Kind of... (I have mixed feelings about tough love), but my bf always came back to try and talk to me and it was hard for me to see him so low and alone (unless with druggies) so I continued to try and be a support without enabling. I broke down a few times this week in front of him about how bad his drug problem was and how he was affecting me... and tried to gently tell him that I needed to detach if it continued.

Today when I was angry with him, and tried to say goodbye for good, he finally made the call to a rehab that he’d been considering. He then called his parents and told them he was going to go and did his entry interview. Tomorrow he will know what day he can go in. 

I’m happy that this was the outcome. But, I fear I’ve burned bridges with the family. 

I’m really torn up inside about if I did the right thing or not having kept in touch with my bf or if indeed the tough love would have worked months ago if I had stuck to it. 
 
I’m not sure how the conversations will go with the family moving forward and if my bf is to stay in my life I need to be at peace with all of this. 

Did I enable? Did I make it worse? Am I a fool? Was shining a light on the issue a good thing? Did I help my boyfriend believe in himself and his family was too harsh? Should I reach out to them and make peace before he goes? 

Has anyone else struggled with this?",2,0

It was the end of about a month long relapse.  A relapse that almost killed me.

  

I went to detox for 7 days and then went to a inpatient treatment facility for another 75.  Today I’m grateful for this day and that I’m still alive.  I still struggle sometimes with feeling alone. I had to let go of the friendship with my best friend when I got clean. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done. She uses though and being around her is a slippery slop. I miss her a lot. 


Currently, I’m attending NA meetings. I have a sponsor and it was suggested I do 90 meetings in 90 days. I’ll be honest. I don’t like them. I fear speaking. I know I need the connections with people in recovery though and in order to make it I must go to anything to stay clean.

Not necessarily substances, though I do not discount them. More so people and some misplaced sense of belonging (or rather trying to resolve it by finding where I'm supposed to be).

This year has been the best and yet most difficult of my life. I had the opportunity to experience true love and it was/is just like what your grandma told you about... In short, that didn't work out (you can't eat gold, eh) and I found myself in a very dark place that I hadn't been in over a decade. I got myself there; on the first snowfall in my area, going through withdrawal, I crashed my car head on and sustained a concussion. I was not wearing a seatbelt and should be dead.

After I went home from the hospital and finally slept, I had the most vivid dream of my entire life. I wish I never woke up. Not in some ""emo"" way. It felt like I lived someone else's life for a moment and that was the dream. It was that real. 

Ever since then, I have not been able to touch alcohol and several weeks before - something started happening where I just didn't/""couldn't"" drink the way I usually always have. I'd sit with a bottle of whiskey next to me and just stare at my fire all night long... October was me attempting to say ""fuck this"" hard and be alone/an even worse me. LARPing like I'm Kurt Cobain is definitely on my ""Top 5 list of all time stupid things I've done in my life""...

I almost quit tobacco after my accident too. No one knows me, but that would be very uncommon. I love tobacco. For all intensive purposes, I'm ""sober"" for the first time in my life. I'm at week 6 of withdrawal, where you still have a few particularly bad days just randomly show up.

I've got 80% of a ""new life plan"" hammered out. I don't know if it'll work (don't care, I'm here to do good so that's what I'll do) and I should do more to accomplish things, but I'm absolutely terrified of succeeding. Fucking terrified.

I think this accident saved my life and there's a lot more to it...",7,0

Its worked so far and everybody is proud of me as I am myself but I'm tired of feeling left out and lonely all the time.

I'm finally in recovery for the first time like ever basically. I'm 34. It's close to 5 months since I decided to stop abusing benzodiazepines. That experience was not fun going through that detox. So anyways, I'm finally feeling better but what did I do to my life? All the times I tried getting clean and times I thought I hit rock bottom, they were definitely preparing me because I have no idea how I survived withdrawal. So anyways, feelings. They suck. But boy oh boy does it FEEL GOOD to finally have genuine FEELINGS. Even if I'm crying like all the time when those happy moments arrive I make sure to cherish those.

That supposes a cruel God who orchestrates pain for some for the good of others. How does he/she/they decide who is worthy? The truth lies in what do we do with the circumstances of our lives moving forward? How do we do better when we know better?

8 years ago, my mom was suddenly and devastatingly diagnosed with an undetectable and often unheard of cancer. The only case studies I could find in n my graduate level research were if the initial surgery to remove the tumor which still often resulted in death from either the surgery or the cancer. My mom was traveling down that road when one night against all odds, we as a family close hope and sprung her from the hospital to get ti a doctor who believed he could treat her. All she had to do was survive the night. And she did! And she underwent every chemo treatment they deemed improbable and radiation that was not even thought to be effective to be cancer free the following October and every year since.

Those weeks if her diagnosis and following were awful! I went through some of the most excruciating grief and loss I have ever encountered. I now have compassion I never imagined for those facing a cancer diagnosis and experience that shapes how I respond. I could have left that year behind and done nothing with what I learned. Instead, I have chosen to respond with love and kindness in areas when others had no words to give me. Did God use my mom’s cancer to give me those skills? No! I chose as a human to learn from my pain so I can help others. Know better. Do better.

Did I have to struggle with alcohol in order to have a better relationship with my children? Would’ve been nice if I could have accomplished that without the whole alcohol part of it. But, I have chosen to learn, process, reflect and apply what I have learned to do better and be better. Both of my children would say they prefer me now over what I was. But, I’m going to go one step further. I’m going to say quitting alcohol is not what made me a better mom. It’s the search into why alcohol came to play that role of soother and reliever. I was not just settled with, “Okay, I stopped drinking. All better.” And neither should you.

The real gateway drug is not alcohol. It’s trauma. Unhealed, unprocessed trauma. I have learned there is a ton of trauma in my childhood both in school and at home. I missed the ability to make friends naturally and have healthy connections. Enter alcohol. That made it easier. I lived in terror growing up at home and was never comforted. I almost died (literally) when I was born and for the first month. I never bonded with my mom. She shut down bc she had two other kids to take care of. Enter unhealthy attachments to anyone who showed me kindness. When I experienced pain as an adult, enter alcohol.

As I entered adulthood, alcohol was part of the beginning of any relationship. I didn’t notice it as troubling. The first place I really get like I belonged was the bar. In every other relationship, I felt like I had to work or earn your affection or commitment. I was useful to you so you wanted me around. That stems from my precarious beginning. I was here, so I needed to find the reason and make my life worth something. I missed the memo that I was worthy just because I am.

I am now learning that truth. I now want to be a good mom because I love my children, not to prove I am worth something to my parents. I don’t need to go the bar to find connection. People are connecting with me because they want to. I am learning how to create and nurture relationships healthily. But, I need to confront the pain that let alcohol in my life. The pain of loneliness I had to mask with alcohol and going to the bar. The pain of not being loved and valued by two men in two marriages is what happened and I will be okay. I don’t need to drink to forget that sting. My life after those marriages has been full of blessings.

I am learning that just because someone shows me affection does not mean they love me and are worthy of my love. People will do nice things for me because they love me, not because I can do something for them. The girls in elementary school were mean. That’s it. That’s not the way the world works. Men who realized I was wounded and exploited me were wrong. I am not bad because that happened to me. I didn’t know that I was worth all the love.

I am learning that now. I need to undo the harm from all the behaviors I learned and start over. I have taken how I grew up and made sure that is not how it was for my kids. The abuse I experienced from my siblings is not how my children relate to each other. I didn’t have to grow up in that life to give my children that, but I didn’t let that trauma destroy me. I am learning that connections with men are not reliant on time, my sexual prowess, or my things or time I give them. It is reliant on our connection and trust we build. Do we enjoy being together? Are we good to each other? I am now confident in my relationships enough that if I only see them once a week because I am a mom the rest of the time, I am not crippled with worry that they’ll leave me. I over extended myself trying to be everything to everyone so they would stay in my life that my anxiety was out of control. How did I manage that anxiety? Alcohol. Where did I find connection? The bar.

I am only in the beginning of Untamed, but this cheetah is starting to step out of the fenced cage. The old dirty bunny is not where it’s at anymore. It takes the courage to acknowledge the pain that shaped choices and circumstances that have happened and trust that it can be different. I can mess up and their love won’t be gone. I certainly expected my relationships to be over because of the actions I did when I was drinking. Alcohol used to help me get everything done till it didn’t. Soon it became the only thing I could manage, and that was exhausting. I was dropping all the other balls.

Getting sober ain’t easy. To begin to heal all the other things once the alcohol is gone is super hard. But, I am better than I have been in years. Better than I have been ever. I’ve gone through and processed more pain in the last 109 days than I have ever in my life. I’m also calmer and less anxious than I ever have been.

There are a lot of unknowns in my life at this moment. But everyday is a step. And I have people in my life that know my truth and let me speak my truth. Even when it’s uncomfortable to say, I can say it and be heard. The others don’t matter so much anymore. I’m losing my sense of obligation. I don’t owe anyone but myself for my existence. I have chosen to survive. Even when I was two days and 1 week old and 3 months old, I chose to survive and I haven’t given myself enough credit for that. 109 days ago when I wanted to drink away all this pain and stop hurting, I chose to survive. That little girl deserves some credit. That woman deserves some credit. And most of all, I deserve love.",5,1

I've been an addict for over ten years. I've been through the mill with most addictive substances and faced the consequences of them as well. I have been in and out of the the legal and rehab system regularly since I was 18, I'm 28 now. Despite multiple inpatient and outpatient stints the longest stretch of clean time I've had is 6 months. 

I just got out of jail after doing 6 months. I came out healthier physically and mentally than I've been in years, I thought for sure that this time was going to be my start. 

I lasted about a week before picking up, and although I only used for 2 days all my progress has been reset. Now my outpatient wants me to do an inpatient and halfway house program. I'm not opposed to treatment, I guess I'm just at the point of feeling hopeless. How will this time be any different? And when I inevitably fail and I'm sentenced to the prison time that's hanging over me, how will I stay sober upon release to stop from just going back. I'm at the point where I can see this could realistically be my entire existence.

This cycle, the using, rehab, jail, rinse and repeat. I wouldn't feel so hopeless if it wasn't for the fact that during my previous attempts at sobriety I truly wanted it and was desperately trying. So if I can't maintain a life of recovery when I've tried my absolute best, multiple times, what makes this time any different.

I don't want to be an addict. I don't live like this because I enjoy it or dreamed of growing up to be a low life junkie. I used to believe I could turn it all around, that idea now just seems like a joke. I don't know what response I'm looking for, I guess I just need to hear that this life is worth continuing to even try. I'm not suicidal but If I didn't wake up tommorow I wouldn't find it the slightest inconvenience.",4,0

Desperation was a gift that stirred some desire in me to seek help. For me it was a fear of death. It can be different for other people. Everyone’s situation is different. With even a touch of sobriety, the fear disappears. I was not going to die tomorrow. I was no longer desperate. Desperation does not keep me sober. What keeps me sober is a higher power. I don’t necessarily mean god as some may understand it. I don’t even mean that I merely needed to accept that there was something greater than myself. I knew I was weak. I knew that my addiction had a death grip on my life. That the solutions that seemingly so reasonable were not going to last forever. That each one I used would take me further from salvation. I was hopeless. There was nothing greater in my life than the pain I was living. I was blinded to the idea that anything other than relief from the pain could help. The relief I sought was temporary because permanent was not an option. Permanent was merely suffering the consequences of my actions. Without realizing it I had accepted that there was no easier, softer way. This is when I became truly desperate. When I became willing to trade active pain for a state of suffering. The pain I was living in was going to kill me and I was afraid. At least I would be alive while I suffered. I was willing to try. With that willingness came my higher power. It wasn’t a blinding light that brought me to my knees. It was a dim, yellow glow at the end of a dark tunnel. That glow was hope. There was a possibility that through the suffering to come the darkness would recede.  That with hard work the pain would become a thing of the past. Desperation have given me hope. The hope that there was something more powerful than my addiction. That something is my higher power. That power is what keeps me sober. Maybe hope is just another word for faith?

Hoping there’s someone out there with advice or professional resources to reach out to, or maybe someone can relate. It’s complicated so I’m sorry if this post is a little long but thank you in advance for taking time and helping me out. 

I have a best friend Laura* of almost 15 years. im 30 now, that’s half my life and I couldn’t have done and wouldn’t have wanted to do my 20s without her. Laura is genuinely a really good person; we always had each others backs, great group of friends, close with each other’s families, very cool and social and popular, if there’s something I left out I didn’t mean to because she really is that great of a person and best friend, I think the world of her. 

Laura went off to college, joined a sorority, we lost touch for a few years, and then picked up like nothing ever happened, but something did happen. While away, Laura saw a doctor who did not have her best interest in mind, and please let me explain bc I know it’s personal and not my place to interfere and I’m definitely not judging, but we are close enough that she has told me pretty much everything so here’s where it gets tricky. Laura put all her trust in this dr while seeing red flags the whole time. 

Before I really dig in, Laura is tiny, about 115 lbs and very smart. She has also over a few year span expressed her frustration with this dr specifically and the pickle she’s in. I think it started with unusually and suspiciously high doses of adderall but I’m not sure. I too love adderall, but I’ve become aware of the side effects and dangers of mixing with other medications, especially for someone with heart problems like Laura’s had since she was little. Normally I wouldnt have worried like this but Laura has expressed over and over her frustration with being prescribed BOTH 110 mg of adderall AND 90 mg of vivance every single day. This daily cocktail I soon came to find out is also a mix of other medication (large amounts of clorazopams, Xanax, lexipro, and ambien daily are other ones I came to know of for sure).  

Even though her behavior and conversation was progressively getting weirder and more unpredictable, still not my place as a friend right? Your dr is supposed to be someone you trust with control over your health and well being and I am no dr. Medication is supposed to enhance your quality of life. As unhappy sometimes as Laura was with her prescriptions, more red flags were raised over time, instances such as her dr being unwilling to lower any dosage, saying that if that’s what she wanted then she’d be taken off cold turkey, which I think Laura was afraid would leave her sick at this point. She has also been subjected to trying many new medications that had just hit the market, some which made her angry or frustrated (not normal like this in her personality) which left her wondering if her dr was “getting kickbacks” for “using her as a guinea pig.” Also there were times her dad (a well known attorney) took her to appointments in which each time the dr took extra time to clean up paperwork before they were allowed in  the office (maybe not wrong, but weird.) 

This same dr also treated Laura’s mom, who is also a great person and like a mom to me, she used to  pick us up from parties and let me sleep over and normal fun stuff. I don’t know as much about her situation other than the medications she’s been prescribed have turned her into an ocd germophobe, years before covid. What I do know is that no one is allowed in the kitchen when she is in there , no one can touch or sit in her chair at the table, and that because of germs she won’t hug her kids anymore (Laura and her younger brother) and I know that Laura is frustrated with her mother’s side effects and ocd, especially since moving back home recently to finish college. 

The dr they were both seeing is gone now, their practice and office abruptly shut down with no means of being able to even contact them again, they were investigated and rumor is that they quickly left the country. Laura has now seen a few other drs and I’m hoping that one will help her and her family too. I love Laura and her family so much but I don’t know how to help or if I can. 

We stay in touch and always talk on the phone when one another needs a friend, but things have gotten weird lately. The conversations have gotten longer and sometimes pointless, she’s often apologizing for what she calls “tangents,” which seem to me to be adderall induced rants where I maybe get to chime in “okay” or “yea,” but more often than not the conversation just spirals one sided and though she notices and points it out first, it doesn’t really matter. The conversations usually end when Laura takes her sleeping medications and starts to slur her speech and not finish sentences. It’s painful for me, it makes me sad and I do care, and more often than not I don’t really get to talk to my friend much about anything, what’s going on with me (which has been a lot this year) and that’s okay, but I don’t often feel like she’s really there, just one example being I told her a while ago that my mom, who was like a mom to her, had recently passed, and she heard me but kept talking about college and parties, then called me back days later to apologize because it didn’t “register.” That hurt. 

Please note that Laura has always been there for me, I don’t feel half as concerned for our lack of communication as I do for her mental health and well being right now. Laura has always had irregular sleep patterns but now she will sometimes sleep for 24-48 hours at a time, and I don’t understand how that can be healthy. She was recently hospitalized for what she thought was a heart problem but actually turned out to be withdrawals for taking less clorazopam. She wants to get better, and has lowered some doses with the help of drs as she wanted to, and I thought things were looking up until I saw her last week...

Firstly, Laura is always welcome at my house and has a key, but I wasn’t expecting her to show up at 2:30 in the morning as she did, and I haven’t seen her in a while. My boyfriend and I were startled awake (we usually sleep about 9pm-4am) and we stayed up to calm her down and talk to her while she was super upset. I’m a very firm believer that everyone should have a friend to ugly cry on their shoulder no matter what sometimes, she would do the same for me. But our state (U.S.)  right now is in the height of the pandemic, really bad. Laura and I have both been quarantining bc we both have immediate family members at severe risk, though I don’t live with mine and she does. My boyfriend still leaves home to work essentially, so him and I both have potential to be exposed often. We learned that a coworker of his had just tested positive so we had just started to quarantine and get tested with him taking time off of work when Laura came over, so knowing she couldn’t go home immediately to expose her parents was a given and she stayed for the next four days until our results came back. 

I was still excited to spend time with her but it wasn’t fun, I still do see parts of her personality, but not really sometimes. She slept the first 30 hours of being here, my boyfriend and I let her sleep bc we didn’t want to wake her. When she woke up she was immediately upset she forgot her medication, it was like her only focus. She’d run out of her clorazopam and was trying to reach her mom to borrow some of hers, just a very tense situation. She asked to borrow some of both my boyfriend and my medication, which we need and isn’t that much, it’s correctly prescribed, she was persistent, I drove her back home (20 min away) and back bc she didn’t want to drive on the meds she was already on. 

I don’t mind most of the above but now Laura says she went to the bar down the street before she came over. Several things don’t sit right with this with me. One, Laura doesn’t drink or smoke with the medication she’s on. Two, our state is really bad in the pandemic right now, I respect bars being open if you do choose to go have fun I totally get it, but it’s my personal choice to not go with my family and their at risk situation, so please don’t go to a bar and then come into my home without informing me first, sorry. Three, I’m not sure how much Laura drank but she was very upset when she arrived and she had to drive, even just a short distance to get to my house on alcohol and any medication she was on. And though there are other things that upset me with all of this, I am mostly upset bc she said she went to this bar specifically to troll an ex friend of ours who works there, though the two of us have made peace in the past. This upset me most bc friendships are supposed to be positive and a good reflection of ourselves. I wouldn’t go to bother anyone in their place of work even if I did hate them and overall I don’t hold on to negativity or past experiences like that, it’s very reckless and uncomfortable to be put in that situation for me. 

Laura’s always there when I need a friend, and I do the same but it’s never been quite like this before. Maybe I’m just writing for my own sanity but it’s hard. She looks and acts unhealthy and zombie like, very unhygienic which is out of character, tired and no eye contact, and the four days were supposed to be fun. I’m not the only one who’s interacted with her lately that’s concerned; friends, my boyfriend, her brother, etc. I feel like I could talk 8% of the time and twice she got mad at me for things that she said, I’m sparing the details but it was stressful. It was confusing. She’s open and honest about having abused prescriptions in the past. I’m not sure how I would feel about asking her family for help as they are already stressed and I’m not sure how they aren’t  as worried about her safety and well-being or if they don’t notice because of how this has progressed over a long period of time. I know she was dropped from another class recently. 

I really care and if anyone has any professional resources please help. I hope I don’t sound like a bad friend, and if anyone has any tips on how to be a better friend I’d appreciate that too. how do you address losing a friend to a problem they don’t think they have?",3,4

I’m currently living in a residential program that, clearly stated in their interviews with potential clients, is an evidence based and not 12 step oriented (although they stressed that people are welcome to pursue that on their own if that’s their thing).

It was restructured just before I got here in November 2019, it used to be a “therapeutic community” and super hardcore addiction treatment.  Now it’s a co-occurring place, for addicts who suffer from depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, etc.  

We have a morning group 6 days a week and recently a few of us have been encouraging admins to reconsider our morning readings.  They are heavily religious AA/NA literature.  Which again, is a persons choice, but not the official position of the house.  

They agreed, and came up with “The Language of Letting Go”, but on day two the reading was peppered with “god”.  

I’m hoping that someone here might be aware of a totally secular daily reading, even if it’s not explicitly about addiction.  I know there are probably some books, but what would be especially helpful is a website or something that is free and quickly accessible.

People who had disasters in their lives and were addicts, or drinkers like me. I could see other people had loving, supportive friends, but my friends weren't loving or supportive of what I did or wanted to do. Some were controlling, demanding, and manipulative. Some drained me of my energy. Later I learned about toxic emotional vampires and how they left their victims devoid of energy. 

But not understanding my codependent behavior, I never thought they were the problem. 

I thought I was. I didn’t pay them enough compliments or be there for them enough. Or I allowed them to direct areas of my life where they did not belong. Or I clammed up and gave them the silent treatment. I lived out how my abusers raised me: their needs came first because mine were immaterial. So inside me anxiety grew, and I did not know how to manage it. Again, I did what I always did: I got drunk and stuffed myself comatose.

Despite that battle, what connected us? 

I’ll tell you: My body language screamed needy and insecure. How I carried myself, including my tone of voice, showed up on their radar. Not built on respect or a love for fun or reading or any common interests, I built our toxic relationships on my allowing them to disrespect me, and boss me around, cloaked in manipulation and disdain.  Or keep me in line by giving me ultimatums, threatening to cut me out of their lives if I did not do things their way.

Not realizing what drove me to latch onto people who could not be good friends, I put up with far too much, plus I caused painful endings. I did not know I was passive aggressive; I did not know how to be direct about my wants and needs. 

I did not know what my rights were.

I kept working on my mental health issues that fueled my depression; I kept healing. In that light, I grew to see toxic behavior around me. Some people I fought with, not knowing how to change my steps. Others I cut ties with little explanation, if any. Some fought with me, ending our “friendship”.

Furthering my healing on 10-18-2012, I started facing my fears, blogging about any anxious thoughts that crossed my mind. Back then, my clinical depression and complex ptsd were clear, so almost every thought that crossed my mind included my fears.

Doing that gave me strength because I faced those fears, accepting them as they were. Slowly, they stopped nagging me and I went on to my next fear. I kept going and kept going and kept going………. To this day, I do the same thing because as I stared down what scared me, my self-esteem healed. The thoughts my inherited fears dominated settled down and logic grew in their place. I developed common sense naturally, slowly and steadily. Solutions popped up in my head!

Now, I know what was going on. My loneliness and shredded self-esteem drove me to latch onto anyone who paid an ounce of attention to me. Desperate for someone to belong to and to feel secure and safe for the first time in my life, my unfulfilled needs drove my behavior. Desperate for human contact, I went along with what I knew were not good ideas. I didn't know how to say no. I didn't know how to read people or to set boundaries.

Now I ask more questions and to pay attention to their behavior. 

How do they treat others? 

Do they talk about people behind their backs, spreading lies? 

What do we have in common? 

How do they treat me? 

Can I tell them no without them blowing up or bullying me into submission? 

Do they respect my choices or try to talk me into doing something I don’t want to do? 

So while we’re on the subject, how’s your self-esteem?",7,0

I realized that I do not want to pursue a serious relationship until I have at least completed the all the 12 steps or have a year of continuous sobriety under my belt. This being said, I am nervous about the future prospect of dating as a former addict. In a self-conscious moment I was browsing through other reddit dating forums and the many people commented negatively (to put it very lightly) about the prospect of dating a former addict and it got me super discouraged. I know it is probably too early to be thinking about this now, but I am curious if anyone here (currently in recovery) or is a former has any dating success stories or tips.",10,0

This is my first try at sobriety, and I have 107 days. I just left an AA meeting where someone had a close friend pass away from an overdose and it triggered a lot of feelings of unresolved grief I’ve been holding on to. I thought I had started working on it in some way, but driving home it hit me harder then it ever has and I am completely lost and devastated.


In June of 2017 my girlfriend passed away suddenly. We had been together for almost four and a half years. At the time I was a heavy drinker, and after that I did a pretty good job of making sure to drink any time my emotions ever got too intense.


Against my will, life went on. I learned to bottle up my emotions and repress every deep feeling I would have by drinking myself into a numbness. I couldn’t cope with it when it happened and I never learned to cope with it since then. I would only talk about it with people when I was drinking, and because of this, my friends pretty quickly got fed up with me. They all seemed to have each other for support while I became increasingly isolated. Eventually I lost all of my friends because of my drinking, and alcohol became my crutch and only support.


I’ve had some small breakdowns so far, mostly in therapy, but this is the first time I’ve truly let myself feel everything and I’m overwhelmed and just feel alone. I didn’t realize I had been bottling so much up again. I don’t know what to do with myself, but I just feel like there is something that I have to do. All I know is to drink to make the pain go away. I’ve built out some sober supports and relationships but all of them are supports to help with drinking, not grief.


I know loss is a part of life, and it’s something people learn to cope with in time, but what do people do when they feel intense waves of emotion in sobriety? Is it okay to lean on new, sober friends for support even if in the past it has always been about topics related to alcoholism? They know of what happened, but none of them knew her. The people who did either won’t talk to me or probably aren’t willing to have me just call them out of the blue to hear about how I’m just now getting around to grieving.


I just feel alone and unsure of how to process everything I’m feeling right now. A lot of these emotions like anger, helplessness, and complete apathy towards life are feelings I would cope with by drinking. If anybody has any advice on healthy ways to manage these emotions I could really use the help. My sobriety feels strong otherwise, I just can’t shake the sense of urgency that I need to *do* something. Thank you to anybody who reads this.",3,0

Secondly, I'd like to tell everyone a little bit about myself seeing as how I am new to this subreddit. Although I am new here, this is maybe my 4th time getting clean.

I'm a 21 y/o male with polysubstance abuse disorder. In layman's terms, during my active addiction, I would abuse anything that would get me high. My main DOC's however, were opiates and benzos. I've been off the dope since March 11th, 2018. From July 9th, 2018 - April 20th, 2020, I was in prison serving time for crimes I committed during my active addiction, during which I completed a 6 month drug treatment program. However, I was using the whole time I was locked up.

I'm still on parole, until 2024.

Upon my release, I continued to use a variety of substances until finally, my parole officer came to my house for a curfew check one night, and found marijuana and some bottles of hard liquor in my grandparent's home, which is where I had initially paroled to with intentions of being there caretaker. I took care of them as best I could (while using, anyway), and still go there at least once daily to take care of the land and maintain the house. That was on 10/16/20. My clean date is 10/17/20.

My parole officer wanted to violate my parole and send me back to prison for a couple of months, but I knew it wasn't going to help me. I told him I wanted (and needed) to go to inpatient, for the 3rd time in my life. He agreed, and two days after I had my next parole office visit on October 23rd, I committed myself to inpatient rehab.

I did a total of 26 days of treatment, and I sucked in as much info as I possibly could, unlike the other times I've gone through treatment. Why? Because I actually wanted to get clean this time! I finally got to that point of where i was sick and tired of being handcuffed, sick, and being taken away from my family. It took 3 rehabs and over 2 years of incarceration for me to get to this point, but it's all part of my journey.

I'm blessed with a beautiful girlfriend and her 6 y/o daughter, and another one on the way, created by yours truly :). 

I want to be there for every waking SECOND of my child's life. I can't be if I'm using. 

I'm grateful my parole officer caught me using. I wanted to stop, I knew how to stop, I just needed that little push to get me started.

I'm now blessed with the opportunity to stay clean, once again, and I'm blessed and grateful to have 37 days clean. Today, I didn't use. Tonight, I will go to bed clean. Tomorrow, my H.P. will wake me up, if he so chooses, CLEAN. 

I'll end this by thanking anyone who took the time to read, and by saying that I hope that this helped someone, even if it was just to get them clean for today, because after all, that's all we have.

Family, I need your help!",8,0

My Friday afternoons have consisted of FAC with my teachers as long as I can remember. Hell, last year, I was in charge of that committee. When my drinking went sideways, it was because I was using alcohol to cope with the anxiety of teaching. The latest podcast of Sober Powered addresses how alcohol hinders our ability to deal with anxiety normal and alters to structure of our brain immediately post alcohol to be more agitated. If you have not listened to it, please do. 

I would say that waking up in the middle of the night stressed out about that lingering student or disconnected class often plagues teachers. This article is from 2014 and talks about how teachers get only about 6 hours a night. I can’t even imagine what it is now. And alcohol interferes with your sleep. I know I drank to sleep and that only contributed to me falling asleep, not getting restful sleep. As your body eliminated the alcohol, the gaba receptors that were happily buzzing along are no nowhere to be seen and the glutamate in the brain has been boosted because of all the gaba and alcohol you supplied.( Sober Powered Episode 22, 2020)  So bam, you’re up at 3:00 sleep deprived and anxious about your day. How are you going to teach without any sleep?

This is part of the teacher alcohol lie. It doesn’t help with relaxation and sleep. We only think it does because of that initial calming feeling in the first two drinks. I have polls out right now asking teachers about their drinking alcohol and sleep. I want to see if my feeling is right. I am speaking from my own experience and the ahas I experienced listening to this week’s episode. 

But the real shift is when did it become okay or expected that you drink? FACs have always been a thing in my career and go ask your local bar what Friday afternoons are like when the teachers come in. A couple of weeks ago, it was National Drop a Case of Wine off at your favorite teacher’s house. https://www.facebook.com/699965304/posts/10163904133745305/?d=n We can do this without wine, though I did not know this was possible. I didn’t know how you get through a day of teaching without a drink to relax. I would get itchy for that drink around 3:30. I enjoyed decompressing with the my bar friends about the hell that was my day. I’d receive admiration, kudos, and, perhaps, a free drink. It was a win win and I got to relax. But then I began to worry if I didn’t have my me time to be able to get that drink. Then we had to stay home. It wasn’t the same drinking by myself, but that didn’t stop me. My anxiety increased and I thought my meds weren’t working and I could look everywhere else but the alcohol. 

What supports need to be in place for teachers so that drinking isn’t seen as a panacea for the stress of teaching? That teachers who are struggling with drinking can get help without worrying about repercussions? Education about sleep hygiene and turning off our email notifications after 4:00 on any given week day and things can wait till the next morning. That we do leave by 4:00 each day. That we find community who can support us in our struggles and provide more resources so our job isn’t so hard. And there is enough pay that teachers don’t need a side hustle to survive. My teacher friends in their 20s and early 30s all have a side hustle. I’ve only stopped mine this year because of self preservation. I knew it would be too much in 2020 to teach and work a second job. And it finally became too much to teach and drink this year. I hope we can continue this conversation and you can listen to this podcast and learn how alcohol is not helping you cope and it makes it worse for you in the long run.",9,0

I don't think I realised it was the drugs that were helping fill the gap in between my emotions and me at the time, but I've been sober for about 2 week now. It's been really difficult, but I'm hanging in there. 

Besides that, I'm an easy addict - I get addicted to everything easily, if it's fun and makes me happy, I get addicted. It was recently that I met a person, who I thought I really liked romantically, but when our relationship hit a turn where she began to fall in love with someone else, I flew into what was much after what it was like: for example after you take.. let's say vicodin (which I took about twice in desperation), you feel really shitty. My body was shaking, I felt nauseous, and physically and mentally crashing. It didn't make sense to me especially because I've been sober.

I feel like I've ran the hardest most surreal marathon of hell. Its been quite the trivial adventure, nothing short of really hopeless times and trying to survive spiritually. The hope to live is a gift, without hope to live is a dark, empty, void and many people die. I was defeated, I was gone, I knew I lost, death was accepted at any given day. I didn't know when I would die but I knew I could die any day and that reality played in my head for years. I was sad that I had succumbed to something I had associated with weakness, addiction. That was war, a long war and I'm tired of fighting. I have a new and respectful nature of what entails addiction. Addiction needs to be respected and talked about more as it is quite complex and destroys human life. 

Escaping reality will stunt growth and maturity. The best thing I like about being sober is acting consistently in a stable emotional mind set. Its freeing and there's some inner peace to that vibe. I have the ability to make choices today, in the problem the drug was my master and it ran my thoughts 24/7 for a decade. Nothing can replace the gratitude I have for stopping the big tornado (Mach fuckin 7000, God damn) and take responsibility to clean up some wreckage.

How i did not die from my addiction completely blanks my mind and drys my tongue dry of words. I don't understand...there were toooooo many fucking times i squeezed out of deaths grip. Why? People die with one roll of the dice. My brain has a difficult time trying to wrap around the reality of events that I found myself in. I knocked on deaths doors and windows too many times, I'm thankful to be alive today. I'm ready to live again and build my life, I'm excited to see where my recovery takes me because I've been to the fucking bottom, anything is better than the infinite pit of despair and suffering.

I have since amended my obvious problematic behavior (always a work in progress of course). I have maintained a deeply rewarding job, established relationships, progressed in many hobbies, participate in extracurriculars, diversified my resume, I run and lift everyday, and I am now graduating with a 4.0

The rub is that I must stay furiously busy at all times to avoid cravings. I historically sought intoxication due to boredom. I don't know about anyone else, but boredom for me is one of the most bewitching experiences. My mood and cognition tank, delusions have more weight, I become apathetic and nihilistic. And so whenever I enter an 'eye-of-the-storm' period, the desire for chemical stimulation is palpable. 

For some reason there's another pressure tempting me to drink. I recently began dating a girl who is also in recovery, however, she's told me that she can and has been casually drinking with friends. It's never more than two or three standard drinks per session. This bewilders me. I also feel at the moment very emotionally drained from my involvement with her. She is emotionally inaccessible and I just recently became vulnerable again after being cheated on and dumped from a 2 year relationship. I desperately want something serious but she is only interested in casual sex.

Currently I'm sitting here alone exploring every excuse I can think of to drink tonight: I should test it, maybe it will be different, I deserve it, I'm an adult and I can do what I want, It will feel very good, it would be healthy to quiet my mind for a change, nothing matters anyway sobriety is an arbitrary goal.

I am haunted by these thoughts. I understand these are all poor arguments, but volume may overwhelm logic. I don't really care what happens, I just wish I had agency over my entire person.

Hey guys. I’m new to this sub. I just got out of rehab 3 months ago and I want to tell my story, It always helps to talk to others. 


I didn’t smoke weed until I graduated HS in 2005. That summer I had my first blunt and immediately fell in love. I drank in high school but it wasn’t a problem, just drank socially or at parties like most kids then. 

I went to college fall 2005, and when I finally had my own freedom I started smoking every day. All day, morning afternoon and night. I went the way as a lot of people, the whole “this isn’t nearly as bad as dare taught me so I’m sure other drugs aren’t either.” Through college I did a whole lot of mushrooms, lsd, ecstasy/molly, adderall, you name it. The last year of college, 2009 ish, my friends started taking blues (oxycodone 30mg). So I started sniffing them. I was hooked right away with how it made me feel. I went to college in Florida where it all started so I was getting them for $7 a pop. But when all my friends started slowing down and stopping I just couldn’t. I started doing them alone in secret and the lies and manipulation started. Even if my friends/roommates were gonna do one that night I’d sniff 3 in my room and come out to sniff 1/2 one with them. This went on all year and I was starting to take payday loans out to cover them. 

After I graduated my whole family came down, and they had a big hotel room. I didn’t have enough for the whole time, and was the first time I got seriously dope sick. I said I caught the flu but it was terrible. That’s when I really got hooked; at that point I needed them to function and feel normal instead of feeling high.

When I moved back to the northeast I found out that they were $30 each. But I couldn’t stop. Over the time span of 2009/2016 I probably spent $150,000 on those pills. I had a good job that paid well so I was a “functional addict” but my financial life was absolutely ruined. I’d get a paycheck and would only have like $25 because the rest went to cover the negative balance. And I’d go right back to negative. 

So about 2012 I started doing what I told myself I’d never do and drove to the hood to pick up heroin. I never shot it but I sniffed more and more. At first it started with one bag but by 2016 I’d sniff a whole bundle while still doing blues if I could afford them. My dopesickness got really really bad at that point. All of this continued through 2016 when the fentanyl started coming into the black market. I sniffed two bags, usually I’d sniff a bundle so that was my “test run”. And I overdosed in my car in a wawa parking lot. Next thing I know the police were knocking on my window. I’ve never been in legal trouble until then but I got charged with possession and paraphernalia. I got indicted for a third degree felony. 

My lawyer cost $6,000 which I had to take a loan out to pay him since I was already in the red. My credit score dropped to around 419 since I couldn’t pay back any credit cards or loans. Got sent to collections dozens of times. My lawyer got me PTI which I completed while in IOP and the whole case was dismissed and expunged. 

So I was clean from hard drugs in 2016. I say hard drugs because I would still smoke weed, drink socially and take kratom. I was going to NA groups but I never took a sponsor because of that reason. I was lying to the group despite the first step being about honesty. I said I worked steps that I didn’t actually do and my keychains were fake because I was still using softer drugs and alcohol. I was missing the entire spiritual part of my recovery so I still felt empty inside. 

Fast forward to 2018. I had a major epileptic seizure, broke my front teeth off and hit my head extremely hard when I fell. Rushed to the ER, the whole nine yards. At this point my psychiatrist put me on benzodiazepines for my anxiety disorder and the anti seizure effect. My dose kept getting higher and higher because I was manipulating my psych into giving them to me. We’re all masters at manipulation. 

Not only did my dose get higher legally, I was also abusing them. Never had withdrawals because I always had them from my doctor while tricking them to fill them early. (This Xanax makes me drowsy so can we try klonopin? Bang, new drug so filled immediately despite me running out of Xanax in 5 days)

This last year has been terrible for me. The isolation due to covid, my girlfriends anxiety transferring to me so I’d have panic attacks all the time, etc. my girlfriend of 8 years left me and took my dog. I got in a fender bender and got the dui. I kept blacking out and my finances were completely ruined. I lost my job. All this at once within a week got so overwhelming that I tried to kill myself. Luckily I failed. 

I was committed to the psych ward, it helped with the suicidal thoughts a LOT but not my addictions since they kept me on the narcotics. After I got out I went right back to using them. I got in two more fender benders after the one that got me the dui because I kept blacking out/falling asleep at the wheel. 

Finally the last straw was when I totaled my car on a major highway. I spin across all three lanes, but it was 3 am and I amazingly didn’t hit someone or hurt myself. Us addicts don’t really care if we live or die when in active addiction in lost cases, but realizing that I could’ve killed a mother or child or anybody in that accident made me really finally realize how bad I’ve gotten. It was my coming to moment. I could’ve never live with myself if I hurt someone and would probably kill myself for real. So I cold turkeyed from the benzos and called my psych to admit what I was doing and had her cancel all the scripts. But cold turkeying from high dose benzos WITH EPILEPSY was terrible. Massive seizures, tremors, and I even developed a serious stutter to the point I couldn’t talk. 

At that point I was desperate. I came out about my addiction to all my friends and family since I was “hiding it” this whole time. I called a detox facility that day and immediately went to detox for 7 days. While there they convinced me to go to a 30 day program, and I got out Sept. 10. 


We had a lot of group therapy where I learned how to meditate and really work the steps. We also discussed SMART recovery. But what helped me the most was picking up a copy of the Life Recovery bible and going to the pastor meetings ever weekday twice a day. I e gotten very spiritual, and such a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I have hope for the future and I pray every day to my higher power even though I’m still working on understanding it. I’ve had one on one talks with the pastors on my own call to discuss the Bible and principles that are important, plus they gave me so much hope and relief. Spirituality has been the one thing I was missing from my clean time 2016-2018. I’ve gotten honest, open minded, and willing. I left the rehab with so much hope about the future and my recovery. 

I got out about 110 days ago. I’m almost done with my IOP and after I’m going into a one day a week relapse prevention group instead of 3 for iop. I go to in person AA and zoom NA programs and I have MAP which is basically a pseudosponsor that checks up on ya once a week. Now I’m proud to say I’m a grateful addict in recovery. I’m not hiding it anymore. The shame and guilt always drove me back to using, but I feel free from those feelings. I’m working on step 3 right now. 


I hope I didn’t rant too much. I wanted to get my story out. Being honest and talking about it makes me feel relief and joyful. I have hope for the future and I hope I can help others in recovery. I just flushed all my weed. This adventure sober I’ve never done before, but I’m excited to move forward with the help of my higher power. 


I’m extremely grateful for all of you guys and I love you all even if you are strangers. I’m praying for all grateful recovering addicts to stay on the right path every morning. 

Thanks for letting me post this.

It got physical and I don't remember any of what happened. It got so bad I almost went to jail. Instead I ended up passing out and woke up to find that my lady was on the bus going back home to Colorado. I was heartbroken, angry at myself for what I become. This NEVER happens when I drink and for the first time ever, I got violent. Me and her are still together, she just wants me to control my shit or quit drinking. Which now I'm dedicated to do, I found myself not wanting to touch that shit ever again. I'm that mad at myself about it. I'll be leaving this state come next week to go live with her and a couple of friends cuz it's honestly terrible over here. They are 100% supportive of me quitting alcohol. I'm not the drinker that drinks every night or all the time, I'm the type that when I drink? I don't stop. I keep going, I end up getting really depressed and I end up blacking out. It isn't healthy, I know it isn't healthy and it's holding me back from my true self. My true potential. 

I keep finding myself getting randomly emotional about what happened and I start crying cuz of all the regret I have from what happened. I nearly ruined my life and her life cuz of this shit. I don't want to go back, ever. I could really use support. It's only been 2 days and I know it isn't much but I wanna be sober. I wanna join the pack and enjoy life sober. I don't ever wanna drink again. I don't even wanna smoke weed ever again, I don't have a problem with it. I just... I just wanna live life clean, motivated and be truly happy.

To stay grateful, I pull up my court record and go through all my cases, 612 days suspend, 365 suspend, 90 suspend, etc. All of that happened because I got my life together.

I have been ""dry"" for a while now. Since COVID, I wasn't comfortable going to my one meeting I was still attending per week. They met online for a time, but that eventually fizzled out. I already wasn't really engaged in my AA program so much at the time that COVID shutdowns started. Since that time, I haven't attended any meetings or done any spiritual or AA practices. I even started ""becoming more rational and being honest with myself,"" as I begun to move away from prayer or been a belief in God. ""I'm lying to myself by praying or pretending I believe in spiritual anything,"" I said to myself. I have been miserable.

It starts so slowly, that by the time I am miserable enough to want to do something, or on the verge of considering relapse, I can't even recognize that the reason I got there was because I stopped doing the things that were helping me (AA). I just had this realization over these past couple weeks.

I had been super engaged in AA in local to national levels in the first 2 years of recovery, but then I got a job at a treatment center and used the meetings for the clients as my own. Then I moved from that job as an RA to being a counselor. As my personal recovery waned, I continued justifying it with the fact that I was ""working in recovery and basically talking recovery daily.""

I had some sobering talks with my wife last night. I was thinking that the stress of becoming a father over the past year, and having a second coming soon, and losing my job due to COVID, not having the right psychiatrist or medicine, etc. was the reason I had become so angry and irritable all the time. I had completely lost sight of what AA had done for me. So today, I flip open the *Daily Reflections* book and as always, the passage fit perfectly with where I was at in my life lol. I was dumbfounded. It really helped me connect the dots and wake up to the reality around me. I was reminded of the daily reprieve that we have as AA members.

Even after all of this, I still feel like it is such a hard pill to swallow that meditation, (possibly) prayer, steps, meetings, working with other alcoholics outside of vocation, cleaning house, etc. are things that are **necessary** to my ability to have a peaceful and happy life. Even at this moment, despite this reawakening, I still have trouble convincing myself that I am being truthful in pretending to believe in a Higher Power. I had stronger conviction in the beginning, but it's faded. I am at a crossroads and a jumping off point. Between choosing to continue to be miserable, or deciding to do what I must in order to change, I choose the latter. But I guess I am still just having trouble with some minor bumps in the road.

I wanted to share this so that maybe it would help someone else today, and in the hopes that maybe others would have their own experiences to share with me and help me move through this powerful phase of ""dryness"" towards a spiritual life, once again. Thanks for reading.

I learned in recovery to strive for balance in my life. I also found out how powerful gratitude is, so I blogged daily about what I was grateful for. I began that on 2-12-2013. I knew it was life changing, but I do not know what it felt like.

The subtle changes occurred slowly and over several years. My brain, simmering in problems and depression, needed the slow improvements daily gratitude afforded me so I could adjust to the changes. Years later, I came across an article detailing how a suicidal person goes through with their plan because their brain is drowning in negativity. Their problems overwhelm them and they can only see one way out.

I can relate to that because I have been suicidal twice in my life and took pill overdoses on both occasions. I give thanks to say both failed, but my point remains. I understand the drowning in negativity outlook. I could not see any other way out of my problems. And every thought I had reminded me of more problems I did not know how to resolve.

Determined to find solutions reading about recovery, I learned our brains are like sponges. No different from a sponge saturated and dripping what it soaks up, our water-logged brains drip positive or negative thoughts. It does not distinguish between what is good or bad; it contains the chemicals our thoughts produce. Our emotions and our instincts tell us whether something is right or wrong, except for the lies our abusers pounded into our heads.

If you have felt that, you know it is crippling.

So by changing my brain's environment a little every day with my daily gratitude, my fog lifted. I could feel a positive difference, so I kept going.

Looking back, I can’t remember when I developed my self-awareness. Maybe acceptance came first? I recall working hard to accept what worried me and feared back then because I knew of no other way to change those fears into anything positive. I had to accept them for what they were: an integral part of my reality. My fears are part of who I am. By facing and accepting them as wounds on my soul, they heal.

Developing those three qualities brought me the farthest. The only one I did intentionally was my daily gratitude. The others followed in a natural progression.

That is why I encourage people to address their emotions; when we resolve our emotions, our own logic develops because that area of our life heals. For me, my logic unfolded into my self-awareness and the acceptance of problems I knew I had to address. I saw firsthand in my day-to-day life how trying to understand why I did what I did came easier as I addressed the painful emotions that fueled my depression and crippling complex ptsd I did not know I had until 2017.

Because of the trauma I carried around, locked up inside me, I had no logic or common sense. As I faced my emotions, slowly and over a long time, my thinking straightened out. I faced what I needed to face and accept based on my thoughts. Mine, my thoughts and no one else’s.

Our brains and our emotions let us know what we need to pay attention to, what we need to address. If you do this, start with what problems are uppermost in your thoughts, with the guidance of a professional if you are not familiar with the process. Our thoughts, our pain, our emotional wounds lay out the map each of us needs to follow to be whole as genuine, authentic individuals. Do you know anyone else who has the same wounds you do? No, their path is specific, custom-made to their needs. That is because each of us is unique.

So, what can you do for yourself to find your gifts, your talents, your uniqueness? What does your brain tell you? What do you think your path would be if you added gratitude to your life?",41,0
78,2020-11-15 23:54:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/jv0v0x/i_miss_my_old_life/,I miss my old life.,"My 20th birthday is in 15 days, and though it's never been a happy day for me, the event is surrounded by nostalgia and regret now. Two days before my birthday last year, I broke up with the man I am engaged to now, quit my job, got kicked out of my house, and landed myself in the emergency room due to severe benzodiazepine withdrawal. 

I've been an addict since I was 14 years old but 2019 was a big year for me in terms of drug use. I was using meth, fentanyl, oxycodone, a ton of research chemicals... basically, anything I could get my hands on. I was constantly in search of dope. I woke up looking for a high and went to sleep, or often blacked out, anticipating the next one. 

After two emergency room visits, I began my 'recovery' in December of 2019.  I have had a few slip-ups this year, but because of my lack of employment, I haven't been able to afford any drugs and benzodiazepine withdrawal wrecked me so hard physically and mentally that I've spent the past 10 months in the same four walls, barely even leaving to use the restroom or to go to the kitchen.

I finally got another job this past month and have attained a semblance of 'stability,' as conventional societal standards define it. I got engaged in June, my home-life is less hectic because my grandmother isn't finding me blacked out in the front yard... everything seems to be 'good.' But I'm not good. This has never been what I wanted.

Approaching the end of November, the same month in which my life blew up last year, I'm filled with yearning. I miss my old life. I miss the feeling of excitement I felt when a dealer put a baggie in my hands. I miss waiting for the packages. I miss getting so barred out of my mind that responsibilities, emotions, and thoughts dissipate and all I feel is the sedation. I miss nodding so hard that I have to remind myself to breathe every few minutes. I miss the overdoses, the withdrawals. I miss the chaos and adrenaline of the arguments, the fights. I miss everything about my 6 years of drug dependency. The good, the bad, and the ugly...

Because now my life feels stale. Now, I have no purpose. I have no calling, no passions, no feelings. I have no personality. Everything has settled into austerity and it is so lackluster. I want a rush, I want to cry, I want a good warm hug from an opioid. I want to get pissed off, I want to get angry. I just want to feel *something.* I want to feel alive again. 

I never wanted to get clean. Now that I have a job again, I don't know what's stopping me from going back to my old ways. Everything I've been yearning for the past 11 months is right there waiting for me... so why don't I do it? I hate sobriety. Why don't I pull the trigger?",11,0

The year after my divorce involved a lot of drinking. It was a year of a lot of hurt, and I drank to cope. The following year, I changed jobs because I was hugely unhappy as a high school teacher and there was not a middle school job available. I ended up teaching online and it was a high stress job with deadlines, quotas for student contact and communication. I felt a lot of pressure to meet deadlines - homework graded, tests graded. Instant gratification trying to meet the needs of over 200 students, and I was the only 6th grade math teacher. I realized I was drinking almost everyday again, and I set myself a goal to not drink during the week. That Monday was a DOOZY. At that point, I pretty much had my son 100% of the time except for one night a week. I verbalized to someone in passing, ""I am trying not to drink during the week."" They said, ""You picked the wrong day to do that!""

That was not the only time I was given permission to drink as a teacher or a mom. Hell, I was encouraged to drink to cope with a hard day of teaching. When they found out I was the single mother of two, ""Oh my god! I would be drinking, too!"" How did one meet people or go on dates? At a bar or restaurant of course. I had a built in babysitter with a 13 year old daughter. But, it never went beyond 2 or 3 and I never blacked out. I remember going to bed. I remember conversations and hanging out with my kids. I only went out once or twice a week and I really didn't drink at home. But, this is when I started using alcohol to relax. 

And this is how I explained it to Brayden today. Was I an alcholic? According to what I think of as an alcoholic - drinking morning to night, starting my morning with a drink, drinking at work, I was not. Did I use alcohol to relax or cope with my anxiety? Yes. Did I need it to relax or relieve my anxiety? Yes. That is when my problem with drinking started. I explained to Brayden this afternoon that alcohol is a drug. People can drink and it be just fine, but when you start using it for a purpose of something else than just a drink, that is when you have a problem.  If I had waited till I was an alcoholic or what I and society deems an alcoholic, I would have lost my job and my children and my relationships. Those of you that have been reading this blog for a while know that I was on my way to that just that - losing my job and my family. I had done a number on my relationships and am rebuilding them. 

In 2017, when my job was awful, I left that job because I was using drinking to cope. I had gotten blind drunk at the bar and don't remember getting home because I was dealing with the trauma of my physical safety being compromised in the school where I was teaching. I could change the job, but it wasn't the drinking that was the problem. It was the stress of the job. 

After I left, my drinking improved. Then it became daily and my way to cope with the stress of being a mom and a teacher. It didn't help that my relationships after my divorce were with heavy drinkers, and we hung out and drank at bars. I left that relationship because it was the relationship and the other person that was the problem, not the drinking. 

But, I was drinking, a lot. I couldn't go get my nails done without my diet coke being spiked with whiskey. I deserved to relax and enjoy that hour for my toes and nails, but I couldn't relax without that drink. It had been that way with me and my nails getting done for a couple of years at that point. That spring, I drank so much and became so dehydrated, that I had alcohol poisoning. I had lost so many fluids that I had to go to an IV bar (yes, those are a thing) and get an IV to recovery from that hangover. 

I reevaluated and quit drinking for two weeks. I was doing great, and then that Thursday night, my student's mom was murdered in their house while they were there. And I couldn't handle the grief. My other student had found his sibling when their brother had committed suicide. That caused me PTSD from when I had lost my student the year before to suicide in the same way. By the time we got to that Friday, I couldn't figure out another way to get through that day. I deserved to drink after those two weeks. I can see myself sitting on that bar patio, talking to my good friend, and coping by drinking. I can remember the decision to drink the drink that was placed before me. 

I spoke to my doctor for the first time about my drinking in the summer of 2019 medication appointment. I stopped short of getting help because I was a teacher and a mom. I couldn't admit I had a drinking problem. I didn't drink in the mornings. I never got that drunk again that I needed IVs. I could handle this. I didn't get help. 

I did find Emotion Code. And I used that therapy to help with my daily drinking and things did improve. There is a book on Amazon that goes into the therapy more in depth, and if people ask, maybe I will write more on that because it has played a huge role in my recovery. But, I was with someone new where a lot of what we did was hang out and drink. I never felt comfortable drinking at home and only drank at the bar. It was only two or three. It didn't matter it was everyday after school. I deserved that me time. These are all things I said to myself as I used alcohol everyday to unwind. I was a better mom because I decompressed and didn't go to my son all stressed out from teaching. My new job (3rd school in three years) was amazing and I was crushing it as a teacher. But, I was still drinking everyday. So it wasn't the job. I thought I had it under control. Then, Covid hit. 

I began drinking everyday being stuck at home. The district turned teaching over to a platform and all I did was check for assignment completion. I was going stir crazy. I started experiencing my daughter withdrawing from me naturally as she graduated from college and was no longer dependent on me. This caused an identity crisis, and I didn't know where I fit in her life. This was a huge source of anxiety. Drinking caused me to forget that I had committed to be there for Sean one morning to give him a ride from the mechanic. And that caused a huge rift in our relationship. I blamed being overwhelmed with school and commitments. No way it could've been because I was drinking when he asked. 

These are the beginnings to everything unraveling in July. My unease and unsettling of my relationship with my daughter contributed to the anxiety I was feeling as I left her on her birthday putting me in an anxiety ridden alcohol state at the 4th of July party I wrote about last week. My therapist calls alcohol anxiety in a bottle. Laura McKowen says drinking is like pouring gasoline on your anxiety. 

The night of Brayden's birthday,  I left to drink is because I was feeling anxiety about the rebourgeoning of my relationship with Sean. I felt I needed to be there to assure him I am there for him too. That night went sideways, and I came home drunk to my son after friends dropped me off at home. I can still see my son's face when he asked me, ""Why did you go to the bar on my birthday?"" Bottom line, I felt anxiety about maintaining all of my relationships and only alcohol could make that better. That is what my addict brain thought. It took a weekend of drinking and failed attempts at moderation for me to realize, not I cannot moderate. I cannot be who I am when I am drunk anymore. And like I posted last week on my personal Facebook page, ""I quit drinking because I like sober me better than drunk me,"" The end. If I had waited till I was the alcoholic portrayed in AA, I would have lost everything. 

The question I ask myself is, ""What if I had listened to my brain and heart any of these other times I knew I had a problem with my relationship with alcohol?"" What if you listened to yours? You don't have to wait for the quintessential rock bottom. Nothing says you have to have a rock bottom to pick up your toys and go home when it comes to alcohol.",2,1

Earlier this year I seemed to be doing really well and even went a month without using at all, I would only use one or twice a month as opposed to using them daily like I used to.

But then I had a very nasty falling out with my best friend during which he repeatedly called me a 'reckless, destructive nihilist' for breaking lockdown to take drugs and he blocked me on everything. I don't think he's coming back, but i talked to him every day and he knew almost everything about me. It turns out the only reason I was almsost getting sober was because of him - i dont know how to do it for myself.  
   
Being sober seemed unbearable so I very quickly returned to taking four grams speed and tramadol at the same time, I was awake for about four days and by the end I was fully delirious and psychotic. I fell asleep and decided maybe to try and stay sober, but then these unbearable feelings of loss and hurt came back and I returned - another four day binge. Starting with one gram of speed and some dexi-amphet.

This time I ended up going to a friends house because we thought we were going to have a ''sober night'' with a few drinks but i'm ashamed to say I bought another gram of speed anyway simply because I wanted to stay awake. Plus her flatmate bought some ketamine and we ended up doing that. I showed up to her house completely unwashed and unshaved because I was so high on speed whilst at home that I couldn't force myself to wash. It's hard to describe but when im on speed I just sit and focus on one thing and its hard for me to break out of that.   


All her friends had been informed I had a speed problem and kept commenting on how long I'd been up, I overhearrd some of them saying I was ''acting like a tweaker''. After evveryone went to bed I continued staying up and doing speed, someone woke up and saw me and I was so ashamed of myself I cried. I can't bare to even talk to my friends right now, I feel like they all seem me as some worthless addict 

I would get more but I dont have any money now and I think my dealer is getting concerned. I don't knwo what im going to do for the next few days anons. I have some valiums and xanax to knock myself out so I wont feel dreadful awake, but the thought of being sober for more than afew days seems unbearable.",9,1

I was in a religious cult, dating a narcissistic man who controlled what I said and how I looked. I was desperate for attention and a place to belong to, so I went along. Looking back, I can’t believe I did that and I see why I did.

I need not belong at any cost now; I am stronger and happier finding my own way. I pace myself better these days and am excited about starting my 13th year sober, happy, and planning goals I want to accomplish.

Now I am better at stopping negative thoughts and don’t let them ruin my mood. Now I replace them with acceptance so I can get past them and be my most productive.

My message of hope.,"I am experiencing the only window I've ever had during withdrawal, or I am now finally and officially healed, because I am symptom FREE.  To say I feel good is an understatement. This is quite possibly the best week I've had in ages from an overall health and wellness aspect.  If I can get to this finish line then I know you can or your loved one can as well. 

I've never been more happy to be alive in my life than I am now. I'll be straight with everyone. I might of ended up in the hospital mid-July, because I lost it. Some unfortunate things transpired. What benzos had been doing to my mind and body were the ultimate reasons for this slow free fall into just sickness. A darkness I've never felt in my life had taken over.  I was positive I wanted to die. I was going to. I had a plan. I found some strength and go to this facility.  I purposely chose to detox on top of this psychotic episode I'm having. Great idea. Let me tell you.  Anyways, insurance so they have to release me on day 10. I was feeling ""ok"" at that time. Little did I know what was still in store for me. I guess sometimes the universe really wants to test people.

Once I walked out of the hospital, now 7 days post benzo, the world decided to up the ante.  I suspect the safe environment of the hospital must of helped things, because once I walked out those doors I sunk even further into the abyss. Full blown benzo withdrawals. I am literally losing my mind. The pain is unreal. I am going to die. I want to die. I feel like I'm dying. I even sadly beg my father to shoot me like a wounded dog because the overall level of pain was almost too much. This is literally unbearable. I always thought I was no stranger to pain, but I had never experienced this level of pain. This goes on for too long.

But. You know. 

I DID it and I am still here. I have never wanted to live life more than I want to now. The depression and anxiety that I was accustomed to while on Klonopin. Lifted. Gone. No more.

I’ve been abusing stimulant substances for about 6 months. It started when I was about 19 and a half, next week I will be 20. I have abused both adderall and benzedrex inhalers. For those of you who may be unaware, benzedrex inhalers contain a substance called propylhexedrine which is a structural analog of methamphetamine. I’ve never used meth but many people who claim to have used meth say that it feels very similar.

I normally use these two substances several times a month, simply because I don’t have a steady supply of adderall which is my favorite of the two. If I had a bunch of adderall lying around I know I would take it all day everyday, however benzedrex I have to be in the mood for. Whenever I take adderall I usually take 60-120 mgs which I know is crazy and has almost put me in the hospital on several occasions. However a couple months ago I was able to score a good amount and took a ridiculous amount in the span of about a week and a half, everyday. I think the highest dose I ever took was around 160 mgs at one time.

After that particular binge I ran out and I have never felt quite the same since. I remember feeling completely and totally empty after the binge was over (which I’ve read is normal), but that feeling has lingered a lot. It has gotten better but things don’t tend to get me as excited or happy as they used to and I feel generally unhinged. My moods have turned quite erratic since then as well. 

I’ve relapsed several times on both adderall and benzedrex since that particular binge because I just get so tired of not ever feeling excited or happy about anything. I know that the only way for my brain to ever heal is to completely stop abusing these substances but it’s so hard to stay clean. I’m very much addicted. But I’ve begun a relationship with someone just a couple weeks ago and I now have a real desire to get clean. I’m just worried that the damage I’ve done is irreversible. My brain is still developing and I know that drug use is terrible for young brains. 

I feel very regretful and suicidal at times because I feel like my brain will never return to normal. If anyone has any advice, guidance, reassurance...it would be much appreciated.",22,0

Today is day 94. Three weeks ago I experienced my first evening feeling the feelings and sitting with them. I cried. I sobbed. And I didn’t numb it with alcohol.

Today started out pretty good. I woke up a little bit early and had my time to enjoy my coffee. I got a text from a friend who is just over a month clean from drugs. We have been cheerleaders of each other’s journey. Today he was talking in circles and had begun to self harm. I approached it as I would anyone who was strugglinn trying to remind them of the good things they’re achieving with being sober. I thought I was making headway and the conversation ended. I started the school day with meetings. They went pretty well.

Then miscellaneous tasks. Office Hours to answer questions. 5 kids showed. 3 asked questions. The session even went 15 minutes over time! Wow! 

While I’m teaching, my daughter texts and has a pretty imminent crisis and need $700. I don’t have $700 and I told her I couldn’t help. My stress level was increased due to the frantic nature of her texts. 

After that calmed down,I stepped out and helped an old family I used to teach. I had fun thinking creatively on how to help this young man understand fractions. I recorded for an hour. I sent home an update to families about homework that was due. I was assaulted with messages of confusion and inability to find things in Google Classroom. I decided to just hold another office hours. 

They started at 2:00. While I was working with students coming in and out, I got a message about a student who’s mom went from having cancer to dying and possibly transitioning to hospice. And 15 minutes later, my friend from this morning texts me that he’s in the hospital for a suicide attempt. He admits he lied to me. I’m shaken. Did I not pay enough attention? Why didn’t I listen more or read between the lines. Why did I believe his words? 

And my day began to spin. The exhaustion from working continuously without lunch and constantly being “on” for those hours, not sleeping well the night before (insomnia is still a thing), my student’s mom dying, and my friends attempted suicide and how I had missed his cry for help. 

I still had students meeting with me and working. I’m reaching out mutual friends to check on his landlord and see if they’re okay. I’m rereading messages to see what I missed. I’m talking to my sober buddies to get support and verify that this has truly turned into a “What the Actual Fuck?!” kind of day. 

And, there is still not a meeting at 4:00 on a Friday. And I realized I’m not going anywhere today. My last stint a year and half ago to rethink my drinking ended the night my student’s mother died suddenly. I can’t leave. And normally, I retract when I’m having a hard sobriety day. Today - I kept talking to Sean. I explained my day to him. I explained my day to my two sober teacher friends. I explained to my friend, Olivia, who has been my supporter since I got sober all the way back on day 1. They all said, “That’s a lot.” It is a lot! It’s a mother fucking lot!! 

I sobbed. I sobbed some more. I texted. I talked. I prayed my friend would get the help he needs, and decided I am not the one to support him in this journey. And I didn’t drink. And this time, I felt better faster. I rested more. And, I didn’t worry about my house. And I didn’t drink. And, this time, it hurt like hell, but it was easier.",36,0

First 2 weeks hard.

Also had bout of combined bacterial tonsillitis and glandular fever - recovered almost fully now.

My sister and I are extremely glad to hear this as she has never wanted to before. My sister, however, wants to speak to our father  (moms ex husband) and close family friends about the next steps as it involves me and her taking up a loan in order to finance my mom’s rehab and get her on track to self sustainability. 
I see no problem in having to abstain from speaking about my mom’s affairs with anyone. As I have a full-time job and somewhat financial security the loan also wouldn’t be a problem for me. My sister, however, is not in a position to pay large monthly installments on a loan and wants to seek advice first. 
My mom is completely against the idea of us discussing her rehab with anyone whatsoever. She has made it clear that if we do she will break everything off including contact with us.
I can see that it is coming from a place of shame and embarrassment. My sister thinks that she is doing it so that there are no expectations of her and in the event of her quitting rehab early there will be no one to cast even more judgment upon her. My sister thinks that if you really want to get better you don’t care about what anyone else thinks and your main focus is recovery.
My mom is the type of person who would rather work towards a goal in secret and surprise everyone with the achievement later on. All throughout my life she has told me to do the same. So that is also one of her reasons.

The funny thing is that at the beginning of the year my sister was also battling with alcohol addiction. She even lived with me for a short while then with my dad and even stole alcohol from his girlfriend. I still clearly remember asking my dad not to discuss it with his girlfriend. He told me that my sister forfeited that right as she still has not realized what damage she is doing to all of us and that we have the right to talk about her in whatever capacity be at to help her or to vent. Another funny thing is also that I am once spoke to a family member who wasn’t close at all about my sisters condition because they asked me how my sister is doing. With these sort of questions are usually genuinely tell people the truth – not just some small version of Smalltalk. It then came up in conversation with my sister and she got upset because she didn’t want me discussing her private matters with people who are virtually strangers to us. I then told her that I didn’t know that she wanted to keep it private and will from now on only discuss it with close family members.  

As the person who is being discussed in such away I understand that it can be very hurtful and embarrassing. But I don’t think there is another alternative. The alcoholic has decided to go this path and continue this path without taking serious steps to better themselves such as rehab. That is selfish. They cannot expect others to not to be selfish/reserved in conversation then. 
I understand my mom to because it is embarrassing and I think everyone should have a certain amount of control over how people perceive them. Some people control it on purpose with a certain look and style for example and some people control it unintentionally. But everyone has the same means to influence the perception of them. When you start intentionally gossiping/talking about a person with another unrelated person without any context, precursor or concern you’re already changing their perception. And there’s nothing the said person can do about it except prove them wrong... maybe that is the burden they have to carry. But it is an additional mental strain thinking “I’m going to show them” or “I told them I will finish rehab. If I don’t they will see me as a failure.” And that’s not an ideal situation for anyone who needs all the strength and support they can get.

Please let me know what you think. I’m not sure what to do - take up a loan myself without my sister and not speak to anyone about it? Try to convince my mom that it’s our right?

I was terrified of being a homeless druggie and dying leaving my friends and family behind and in pain. Up until now, my reasons for sobriety were entirely based in fear and avoidance of an outcome that I didn't want to see come to fruition and I had awful cravings that never seemed to go away. I figured I would just have to deal with the cravings and would probably eventually relapse.

Last week I got to spend time with my close friend and her little brother. It wasn't anything special, we went and played mini golf (and were awful at it) and video games in the arcade. Her little brother was running around having a great time just being a kid then we let him have our tickets to get prizes with and he was so happy. 

It seems like an insignificant night but it really got to me for some reason and I literally cried on the drive home bc it made me realize just spending time w my friends and being stupid together is better than any high I can ever get. I want my happiness to come from real experiences and not me sitting alone in my room doing drugs and needing more once it wears off. I need to stay sober so I can continue to have nights like these. Ever since then my cravings have stopped entirely and I have no urge to relapse whatsoever and I've actually quit drinking as well bc I don't see a need for it any more.

He had annual conventions he attended here in the United States and where we live in Florida. He had several Area comitments and Chaired PR for several years which I was a panel member. He also did service at the World Service level distributing new Basic texts in Africa newly published in their native language years back. He taught me so much about NA and I got into the history and collecting old literture because of him sharing this experience. Before we met I did service only because I wanted to stay clean. He taught me to do it for love of the fellowship and newcomer. With all his years clean he had a hug for everyone and always introduced himself to everyone new.

That is one map we can follow. And it is our privilege to live and heal that route because along the way, we find and nurture our unique selves. Also, we can share our experiences with others and help them heal also, once we are ready to share and once they are ready to work on their own route.

Our abusers trashed our lives with their hatred. The painful wounds that keep playing out in our heads points us in the direction we need to go to heal those wounds and remove their obstacles. Those obstacles nag us because they are not a natural part of us. They aren’t at home; if they were, they’d chill out and settle down. 

Our one of a kind soul is trying to kick them out. So, what bothers you the most is where you start. No one has the right to tell you any different. 

For me, I had to begin by facing my monstrous family. I had to face the pain they buried deep inside me that haunted me, that drove me to drink, drug, act out, and overeat that still bothered me decades after I severed ties with them in late 1979 or early 1980s. I changed my location physically, but emotionally my path, covered in seething anger and bleeding, went with me everywhere. 

Back then, I didn’t know the extent of brain damage and emotional hurdles I faced. Being fragile, I needed the time to heal and gather my thoughts. I think in spring 2011, I began with my then therapist, and having recorded the sessions, I listened to them at home, alone where I could cry, uninterrupted.

In the past, I worried about hurting someone if I allowed myself to feel what I ran from. But I didn’t; when I accepted my pain, I cried and it hurt. But I got through it.

I saw and felt better firsthand. Not a huge amount, but better. The tiny voice inside me suffocating under the cruel lies and bleeding, hurt wounds that caused me to live my life in lies, distorting everything I did, breathed a little stronger.  So, encouraged, I kept going. 

Looking back, I see how my path is unique to me, just as your path is unique to you. The events that shape us will vary. Our perspective will be ours alone; it will differ even from our siblings. No one sees our world the same way we do. It is individual to each of us, alone. 

But the emotions? The emotions will be the same; shame, humiliation, embarrassment, isolation, and the rest we share. 

Our unique selves are suffocating underneath that pain. So, for our beautiful, one of a kind genuine, authentic selves to breathe and thrive, those obstacles need to go.

Because pain that nags us, desperate to go because it is not at home inside us, never gives up on receiving our validation so we can release it. Our soul, our inner self, is doing its job. It is looking out for our wellbeing and urging us in the direction we need to go so we can heal and live our life, the life we were born to live, including the pain we overcome and healed.",44,0

So I started therapy for my adderall abuse & underlying mental health issues tonight. My using started out pretty innocent a few years ago and has grown to be a much bigger problem than I ever anticipated (from 20mg once or twice a month to help with long work days, to 100-150mg over 1-2 days.....sometimes without any good reason). I was in therapy on & off over the years but never for substance abuse and I haven’t been back in 2 years.

Adderall has been a (toxic) way for me to cope with my social anxiety, depression, and the sudden deaths of 3 of my friends which occurred over the past 2 years, but I know it’s making my emotional state much worse bc of the side effects. 

It has been very difficult for me to stay clean for long spans of time because the several people around me who are prescribed it will frequently offer me 5-10 pills for free after they refill. It’s always available. I don’t blame them because I never say no. 

This appointment was cathartic for me tonight because it was the first time I told someone aloud about my struggle with this addiction. I have never expressed even an inkling of this to others. I also explained to this therapist that I have taken other rec drugs over the years but I never felt cravings or a compulsive desire to take more like I do with adderall.

So, about an hour or so into our first appointment, after I had thoughtfully and truthfully explained everything I wanted to about my background and my current struggles, my therapist suggested in-patient rehab for 30 days. 

I told her I’m extremely opposed to in-patient as an option for me right now, but she kept pushing for it.

I know no one ever really wants to go to rehab, but my daily routine, my job, my freedom, and being around my friends, coworkers, and my two kitties have been the only things helping my mental state. I feel like without them I would lose my sense of purpose, and become extremely isolated and lonely. My daily routine is like self-care. It feels good to have a routine. It keeps me energized, creative, and fights my depressive tendencies. 

I think I would be extremely depressed and suicidal in in-patient, after being cut off from everything I love. The times I’ve been the most depressed in my life have been times of severe loneliness. Not to mention I’d risk losing a job that I just recently started and am actually enjoying for the first time in my life. 

I probably sound like a bit of a cliche because I expect this is how a lot of people struggling with substance abuse think about rehab when it’s suggested. Especially first-timers with no experience in the recovery community. 

I understand it is definitely more productive than other methods of treatment due to close monitoring, but I don’t think it’s the answer for me right now. 

Does anyone have any advice on where to start with recovery besides in-patient? My therapist doesn’t want to continue our sessions if I decline the in-patient treatment that she suggested.

I just need more options. Having my only two options rn be in-patient or no treatment is very stressful.

I know I could look for another therapist but it’s also expensive to have these intake appointments and explain your whole life story & personal traumas again. 

Has anyone else dealt with similar situations, or do you have advice for me as someone who is scared & alone & just starting out in recovery?

I appreciate you.",4,0

I never thought i’d make it this far in sobriety. Hell, I thought the only way out was going to be to overdose and die. From sniffing 40 bags a day to 60 days clean. It feels fucking amazing. I finally feel free. I really do feel like I hit my rock bottom this time after i overdosed. Unfortunately that’s what I think needed to happen for me to wake up and start taking this shit serious. 

I went to my first treatment and got out with a big head and no real desire to stay clean. I made it about 50 something days.  I started drinking about a week after I got out. After 4 days of binge drinking, my brain made up it’s mind about what it really wanted and that was heroin. I winded up OD’ing off the first bag in my friends bathroom. I had to be revived with 2 shots of narcan. I immediately checked myself into detox followed by another rehab. I’m now living in a sober house while doing IOP 3 days a week. 

That’s really all I got to say. I’m just really proud of myself. To anybody out there wishing to get clean, I wish you the best of luck, check yourself into rehab if you really have to. It was nearly impossible for me to get clean on my own. But what a ride it has been! Life is truly a blessing now.",187,0

I'm glad I'm physically able to help her out, and the procedure shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 hours at most.

I'm going to take my headphones and listen to some music or audio books. I'm trying to look at this as an opportunity to get out of my own head and help someone else, but part of me wishes I could hide in the house. 

Once we're done at the doctor, I have no responsibility for about another week, so I'm just holding onto that.

The emotional injury is like a physical injury. And just like a physical injury, we need to take care of for it to heal.

But what happens if no one teaches you to do that? Or if the people around you badger you into stuffing all your feelings, belittling you, saying your feelings are not important. I remember one of my sisters telling me I was too sensitive. Back then, my mother and two sisters abused me. As an adult and searching self-help books for answers, I learned that in my 40s.

To me, my sister criticizing me is saying I am not important, which is cruel and mean. And it is something most raised in broken homes experience all the time. Plus, stuffing emotions time after time doesn’t help our common sense or clear thinking. Something happened that upset us; not being able to process it to understand what happened impairs us and messes up our thinking skills.

So cruelty and discounting leads abused kids to years of emotional wounds stuffed down under the surface, crippling us, making us weak and fragile. We avoid events, locations, people, and anything that triggers those wounds because they remind us of the pain we self-medicate to avoid.

I understand that firsthand because I avoided everything I could for decades of my life because I knew no better. I hadn’t asked what to do because I feared my emotions would overwhelm me and I would do something hateful and angry. So, I stuffed more.

Once I got into psychotherapy, I learned I could recognize where my behavior went off track, that I could correct myself and try different things. I got a lot of problems resolved and out of my way. But I reached a place where I got stuck. I did not understand what fueled my self-destruction.

But I knew the time had come where I had to face those emotions because if I didn’t, I would drink again. I had to sit down and face the pain I fought, drugged, and drank to avoid.

Certified in hypnotherapy, my therapist suggested hypnosis. Frustrated and sick of my constant failing and repeating behavior I swore to myself I would never do again, I agreed. I purchased a voice activated recorder and brought it with me on my next session so I could listen to the sessions at home. I wanted to get the pain moving and out of my way as best I could.

The hypnotherapy got me to the places where my cemented, padlocked pain had been out of my reach.

Over the following weeks, as I listened to the sessions in the privacy of my home, I cried buckets and it hurt, but I got through it. My psychotherapist guided me through it and I felt better. I felt happier and wanted to get through more painful memories because I saw the difference it made in my life.

That encouraged me to keep going, to keep writing out my fears as they popped into my head, facing, and accepting what I was afraid of. I accepted what isolated me and what made me push people away.

On October 17, 2012, I first blogged about “Why Overeat in the First Place?” The following day, on October 18, 2012, I blogged about “Overcoming My Fears”.

With those initial blog posts, I embarked on my journey to understand my fears and overcome them because I knew what scared me triggered my need to overeat. I knew no other way to comfort myself. What I wouldn’t know until recently was I had never felt secure. I did not know what safety felt like.

Also back then, I experienced flashbacks even though I did not know they were flashbacks, and I am sorry to say my therapist didn’t either. She did not diagnose me as having complex ptsd, which another therapist diagnosed me with years later. There were many signs, and she missed every sign. Also, she neglected to keep detailed notes of our sessions. Because of that, I have no records of my milestones except for what I blogged about, and I went to her for 8 or 9 years.

Now, I do not let that hold me back. I work hard to better my emotional issues to heal as much as possible. Because of that work, I get to experience the benefits firsthand.

One really important one is seeing my twisted up thinking straighten out. My common sense and logic are miles better than they were before I made great strides in therapy. It is easier for me to problem solve and make decisions now. And I haven’t been in therapy since December 2017.

Another important benefit I see is I realized when something traumatizes us, the trauma and the emotions tied to it knot up inside us. So those thoughts and emotions are fragile and easy to set off. When something triggers any of those emotions, the trauma tries to surface, unless we can contain it.

But when we work to heal that trauma, those emotions heal and behave naturally. Those emotions that frightened us no longer do, and when necessary, we can think about what we can do. And it is WONDERFUL to go through my day, seeing how much better I manage situations that used to make me run and hide.

So, that said, I know I have a ton of work still ahead of me, even though I have been working hard to heal my emotional wounds for over 8 years now. But, I keep putting one foot in front of the other and do everything I can to keep going, healing and pacing myself along my way. Life is much better than it was, and I have several health challenges and am deeply in debt. I have times where I have to stop and face old wounds now surfacing. So, I detour for a while and try to take care of my wounds and my healing.

Then when I am ready, I get back up and keep going.",48,0

Hi,

Thank you for taking time to help and consider my questions.  I know this question may be highly unpopular.  I apologize to anyone who feels offended.  Everyone walks their own path.  And we are all unique.

Like I said, started drinking beer senior year of high school.  Went to college, became a party guy.  I was an Engineer and they wouldn't take me on the swim team as an Engineer.  So I joined a Fraternity.    And I really did enjoy beer.  Smoked a ton of weed.  Sorry that is exaggerating.  But well over 100 lbs while earning my undergrad.

Graduated into finance.  Woke up early, worked 80 hour weeks, and drank at night.  Career moved on and I didn't drink every night.  But most.  And a lot on weekends.  Occasionally getting drunk.  But mostly just regular heavy drinking, and walk home from the bar.  Everyone I knew lived in bar areas.  I'm from outside of Manhattan.  

I want to add to this that after college I got back into swimming competitively, training year round, working out a lot.  And for a few years I was wakeboarding 4 times a day.  Less in the dead of winter.  

When I was in my late 30's, I was owning my own business.  And I started drinking more.  Still managing myself.  But it was progressive in hindsight.  Just slightly progressive.  Then I was 45, had a nightmare contract, spent the deposit on the wrong solution and had to start over with my design.  I was building a software system for a business.

I was drinking about 10 - 15 units a day.  I could sober up and did for a week, or three days at a time, no problem.  I didn't think anything of it.  Then I would just have another drink and did whatever I had to do.

I was in the middle of training for a triathlon.  I think it takes a year of proper prep.  And I wanted to go from doing them casually to doing them regularly.  So upping my whole diet program, exercising 3 times a day in one form or another.  Eating well, sleeping well, tons of cardio and calisthenics, meditating.

And I went to the hospital during Covid.  They were in a covid panic and put me in the covid ward.  Out of the hospital, I was weak from being in the hospital, but no liver damage or anything like that.  Healthy as a triathlete.  

When I came out, my wife demanded I quit the booze and enter a program.  She found one, and we did meetings during zoom and they mailed me a bunch of cups and tests that I did whenever they asked and took a picture of the results.

But not a drop of alcohol for 6 months.  No relapse, no cheating.  And there was booze all around.  Delicious booze.  I cook.  And my Mom's kitchen has a full bar, and a wine collection.  Everything's open.  I was there all the time.  There was beer and wine in the cupboard of the place we were staying.  Never cheated, never tempted.  Just, this was I needed to do because my wife was scared.

I drank too much.  I know I did.  It was destructive.  I'm not denying that.  

Never yelled at my wife.  I'm a happy drunk.  Never got into fights.  Didn't drive drunk.  Didn't break anything.  Didn't hurt myself or anyone else.  But I noticed that if someone got mad at me they would say, you were probably drunk.  So people did notice.

So I did the 6 months program.  Finished it!  I can stay in the program and they just want to talk to me once a week.  

They say that most of the people in the program have had regular and huge relapses.  And I have had none.  They didn't just volunteer this.  It came out from us talking about other stuff.

But they say that now that I quit.  I'm a full blown alcoholic, and if I ever even look at booze again.  I will punch my wife, strip naked, and drive my car through the store front of a super cute kitten store and go to jail.

I know that's not true.  But it's a messed up thing to say to someone.

My theory is I will go back.  Be careful.  Probably have to take breaks over the course of my life.

I found a program that works for me.  If in a few years, or a few months I'm chugging vodka like a lunatic, or doing keg stands, I will go right back into their program and start all over.  Maybe stay off for good if I can't handle it.

The question:

I'm having trouble talking to anyone about this.  People freak out when you tell them you were in a program.  What are your thoughts?",4,3

I was a heavy THC user and recently have cut down dramatically. I am trying to quit forever. I have used a bunch of drugs but stimulants, benzodiazipines and THC are my DOCs. 

I just did some dissociatives I had lying around and the experience is rather uncomfortable. I feel like im a robot devoid of emotions, its really weird. I tossed them just now. 

When i use THC instead of being relaxed and happy, I'm a anxious mess debilitated. I dont really do much besides eat and feel bad about the fact that I am high. 

When I drink I dont feel comfortable and inhibitionless, I feel just bad. 

When I use stimulants instead of being productive and social, I'm a dopamine seeking robot performing stupid repetitive tasks that give me a false sense of accomplishment. 

I'm starting to realize I LIKE BEING SOBER more than being on anything. I wish my stupid brain would be okay with the fact but I always find myself wanting to use. I think my subconscious is trying to tell me something.

It can bring you healing as well as the person you are making amends to. In my experience, there have been people who forgave me, people who didn't know what I was talking about because my error did not leave an impact on them, and people who refused to meet me halfway.

My goal is to reach the people I bullied so I can apologize to them. My bullying goes back to my childhood; I am 63 years old. My victims could be anywhere in the world, so I appreciate any sharing of this!

So, dear reader, if you know me, chances are I owe you an apology. I bullied and abused innocent people without realizing the harm I caused. The adults responsible for my well-being never taught me how to solve my problems. Saturating me in hatred, they taught me to hate myself and abuse others like they abused me. I learned what I saw every day.

Bullies raise bullies; I am living proof. My family abused me with such ferocity I ended up clinically depressed and burdened with complex ptsd, plus other mental and physical disabilities. A few years ago, I found out I am learning impaired and have amnesia. I have written what I remember from my childhood and it didn’t even fill three 8 by 11 pages. I locked the rest up in my memory I may never recall.

Sadly, there are millions who relate to what I am writing about because they live it too.

Sober for over 12 years now, I embrace my responsibility to apologize for my atrocious behavior. To be clear, I am not blaming my family for how my life turned out; I include them as a measure of accountability. My six abusers, including my deceased mother, have gotten away with what they did. And I checked; the statutes of limitations have all run out.

Growing up bullied by my family, I understand the truth behind it. It was never about the people I assaulted. Something my innocent victim did or said triggered unresolved issues stuffed deep inside me because my family never allowed me to voice my pain. Instead, they brainwashed me into self-loathing and self-destruction. I spewed that combination at innocent people who never deserved my savage storm.

And that behavior came out of nowhere. I remember one neighborhood girl I bullied when we lived in Huntsville, Texas. I remember saying to her what my mother and sisters said to me every day. I made that poor child cry and I remember feeling bad about it. I didn’t know what to do. I thought her behavior justified my talking to her the way I did.

While playing chess online in the early 2000s, I lost a game and messaged my opponent an atrocious attack. So, he went to the game forum and warned others about me. I found this out from the next player I met. I went looking for the post and read it. It shocked and angered me at the same time. I have a vague recollection of reading his message and dismissing it immediately. I ignored it.

Working on the inherited toxic waste that fueled my mental illness problems dominating my entire life, I slowly realized the damage I caused. To do my best to repair that damage, I worked and continue to work hard to heal to be strong enough emotionally to apologize and find out what my victims need me to do to make it up to them. I waited because I needed to be my strongest possible to give it my best.

So, I know I am ready because my most significant achievement has been to eliminate all cravings I had for alcohol and for emotional overeating. I now live craving free. My brain is quiet and I can think. I get right to sleep at night with no sleep aids. My brain tires easily, but I am managing much better now. I am happy, sober and productive. My self-esteem is healing nicely. Weighing 298 in June I have lost 28 pounds since.

But, back to my topic, there are also people I owe money to. Not being able to work a standard job because of my mental and physical disabilities, I funnel what little energy I have to improve my writing. For example, I enrolled in online courses through St. Louis University in St. Louis, MO in August 2015, and learned a lot there. Flunking out because of my learning disability, I continued to improve my writing on my own. Thankfully, I found writing software that guided me as I continued to learn. And there are oodles of websites about proper grammar and I read articles on how to improve my writing.

That said, I am determined to present writing people will want to buy because I will get myself out of poverty and off of welfare. I believe money is coming; I am not sure when yet, but I know it is coming. There must be something I can do with what I have learned about addiction and recovery to earn my living, even with my disabilities. I want to live my life as a responsible adult helping others with what I know best: recovery from addiction.

Back to my topic, could we know each other?

Here is some additional background on me that might help you remember: Born on February 1st, 1957, I went to school under Bettina Eason and Alberta Irene Eason. Mother was a university professor and spoke with a heavy Venezuelan accent. I have two older sisters named Annabelle and Melissa. My father’s name was Joseph Kenneth Eason. My parents divorced when I was a toddler; mother got custody of us three daughters. We lived in Little Rock, Arkansas until early 1960s, then moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Mother moved us about every two years. I have ideas on why, but I don’t know the real reason.

I attended St. Joseph’s Catholic School for the 1st and 2nd grade. After that, we lived in Wilmington, North Carolina for my 3rd and 4th grade, in the late 1960s. I think I went to a Catholic school, then switched to a public school, maybe. I cannot remember. Two years later, we moved to Huntsville, Texas. That would have been 5th and 6th grade. I went to a public school because there were no catholic schools there. Around 1969, 7th and 8th grade were in Shreveport, LA at Pope Pius the 13th. I am unsure of that school’s name. Somewhere during that time, my oldest sister left home and that summer, we went to mother’s hometown in Maracaibo, Venezuela, to visit her family.

One day while we were there, mother barged into my room and told me I would stay behind to attend a Spanish-speaking boarding school in the Andes Mountains.

I spoke no Spanish.

Meanwhile, Mother and Melissa returned to the states.

When the time to start school arrived, I stayed with an aunt and uncle I had never met who lived close to the boarding school. Spanish nuns ran the school. The Mother Superior and one student spoke English.

Struggling with culture shock, I stayed in Venezuela for about 8 months. I returned to the states around spring and by that summer, mother moved us to Caracas, Venezuela in 1970 or 1971. That is where I went to high school. I attended three high schools there. I remember the names of two. One was Santa Rosa de Lima and the other was Instituto Politecnico Pestalozzi, where I graduated from high school in Spanish.

After that, we moved back to the states, to Little Rock. I went to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and ended up flunking out. I became Richardson when I got married in the early 1980s. I left my husband after a few years of marriage and moved to St Louis. I lived there for over 30 years. I worked a lot of different jobs. I worked some as a waitress; I got into optics and a few sales jobs. I started calling myself Landon around 1993 when I lived in St. Charles, MO. I worked until I became disabled in early 2000s. I got my name legally changed in 2005 from Alberta Irene Richardson to what it is today, Landon Clary Eason. I now live in SE Missouri.

So, if I owe you anything, please contact me so we can work it out:

Up until last Friday (10/23) I was a consistent marijuana smoker - all day everyday - and by the end of every night I was crawling into bed (if I could make it) with a fifth of Whiskey and a dime bag filled with Xanax. My heavy drinking began Fall 2018 and by Spring 2019 I was getting inebriated for everything - drunk driving, drunk in class, drunk talking to prominent people, while somehow maintaining a good GPA and social life... this eventually led to me abusing LSD (acid) - once a weekend - which began during the pandemic and slowly began to wreak havoc on my ability to functionally interact with society. Do to the LSD abuse I now experience HPPD symptoms which I don’t see going away soon but since stopping psychedelic usage - now a month and a week - the symptoms have gradually lessened. 

Back to the alcoholism... From around January 2019 up to October 23, 2020 (getting there in a second) I was smoking weed 24/7, drinking a fifth to a liter a day of Jack Daniels or cheap Vodka while also abusing cocaine along with the rare Xanax binge to finally black me out so I could wake up the next day and do it again... 

When I say I was living a rockstar lifestyle without being a rockstar that’s exactly what I mean. Risky sex, all liquor - no chasers, cocaine, booze, and Xanax was all I really cared about and I was always the life of the party for it. I felt it was my role to be fucked up (@my profile name) all the time. My friends were impressed, women would engage in the activities too, and next thing I know I wake up with a girl in some random apartment with a bottle of Evan Williams Honey empty on my chest... all of this changed October 23 and since October 24 I am officially now 10 days sober. 

Now to the story of October 23... the reason I decided to get clean. Some of you are about to scoff at what you read and may question how I’m alive... me too.

11a.m. - Wake up. Smoke a bowl of weed. Take a line of coke. Drink a Natty Ice and smoke a cigarette 

11:45a.m. - Shower. Feel like fucking shit. Head tremors and hand tremors. Fuck it. We are getting liquor

12:15p.m. - Acquire two fifths of Evan Williams Honey and a 6 pack Natty Ice

1:00p.m. - .25g Cocaine and a Natty Ice

2:00p.m. - Now I’m feeling good again... this is where it gets crazy 

2 - 4:00p.m. - 1 mg Xanax and a Fifth of Honey 

5 - 6:00p.m. - .5g cocaine up the nose - 3 Natty Ice

7 - 8:30p.m. - Last 2 Natty ice, 1 mg Xanax, .5g cocaine 

9p.m. - Break my pinky punching inanimate object. Fuck it. Hit the dealer up get another half sack of blow and a bar

10 -  11:30p.m. - Finish second fifth of Evan Williams. Take 2 mg Xanax

12a.m. - In a random apartment doing blow and taking shots with girl I met at bar - she kinda sexy no cap 

6a.m. - Wake up. No car keys. No wallet. Dick out in this girls bed and my first reaction was to find another Xanax and just sleep the day away but that’s when I realize that I had taken the last of the Xanax last night. 

7a.m. - Stumble home. Smoke weed. Sleep. Smoke Weed. Sleep again. Realize I’m gonna die if I continue so I make a call for help to my mother who is very understanding and gives me freedom as I take care of my schoolwork and chores and what not. 

——————
Acute Withdrawal from these drugs was the worst pain ever imaginable. Stomach cramps and muscle spasms. The whole 9 yards of hell.

October 24 - October 28 

- Profuse Sweating 
- Agitation 
- Cold but hot 
- Truly hell 

Since then I’m now 10 days sober from alcohol - cocaine - and Xanax... I smoke a 75/25 CBD:THC ratio flower whenever I would usually take a Xanax and it’s been soooooo effective at managing my anxiety and panic during these times. I’m so excited for this new journey. I’ve fucked myself up for 4-5 years it’s time for me to experience life on the cleaner side! 

TLDR: don’t do excessive drugs. They are fun as fuck but for every high is a more extreme low. Be smart with your usage and FUCK ALCOHOL",51,1
