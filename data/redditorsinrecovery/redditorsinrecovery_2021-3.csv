She's been in AA and recovery for about a year and a half, during Christmas time she relapsed twice back to back and was back on the AA/NA bandwagon. So she's been 90 days clean now. I'm forever happy and proud of her. But I have some concerns.

I'm moving in in May, my parents will be helping out for her half of the rent till she moves in for July. Lately although I truly appreciate her honesty, a lot of things she's opened up about has given me some concerns. She's asked to not be on the lease for the first few months which is okay as she won't be living there. So I said we can put you on the lease when you move in. And she said yeah we can look back at it for when that time comes. She's opened up that she doesn't know if she can pay the damage deposit right off the hop because she can't afford it due to not having an income. So I said you'll have to speak to your parents about that because I can't cover that. And on top of all this stress and anxiety for her she's having bad withdrawals every other week.

I don't want to criticize how she's handling life right now. That's not my place and I understand that helping her for my benefit is not the way to go. But as much of a best friend she is I feel I still need to be realistic. I think living in a home together guaranteed with no alcohol or drugs around would be great for the both of us. But I need reassurance that she will pull her weight equally. And to atleast show that she's trying to better help her financial situation. This all being said my fear is that if she's already close to another relapse line, saying these things will push her over they edge. I need some advice to have these conversations because although I've gone through addiction myself, in my story it was a lot easier to pull myself out of it compared to. I don't get the full grasp internally but have seen it destroy others lives due to the thought of the bigger picture and responsibilities they need to take on.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9570100903511047}"

Well I have struggled a lot in the last 10 or so years but these past months I've switched from IV to snorting and only when u start feeling sick so I am weening myself downtown to nothing which I know im still using but im making a huge effort. 

When my 1400$ stimmy came in I only spent 150$ put of it in the last month and only half od that was for drugs. Then my 1000$ refund kicked in and I didn't touch it. I had all this money for about a month and barely did anything with it cause I needed to save it to buy a car after my last one had a tranny go out and it was a POS anyway.

Well today I did it. I got my money out, found a car online through a dealership and bought myself a (new to me) car!! I am so fucking ecstatic and it gives me so much hope for the future!! I am finally putting my priorities first. 

I'm gonna star door dashing right away to get some money coming in as my PUA ended and I need to get my savings back up and now I finally have a way to go see my kids at least once a week. I miss my daughter so much I cry myself to sleep most nights (she's about to be 2) and my son has been acting out with me not being around. I'll never get the chance to be back with their mother but I'm finally fucking doing the right thing. I could have EASILY spent that money on dope.

Like most, it started when I was a student. I just graduated graduate school this past August and was using it regularly throughout my 7 years of college, with an average of about \~20 mg-30 mg/day. I was very productive, learned a lot, and excelled in my program. When I DIDNT need to study, I DIDNT take adderall. I looked forward to breaks. 

Now, I've been graduated for almost 8 months and I have a full time job, but this time I'm  taking adderall \*\*daily\*\*. It \*does\* help me a ton at work (healthcare provider), and in that sense it is very helpful. 

\*\*BUT\*\* my brain tries to convince me that I need it to get absolutely anything done. Stupid things-- cleaning my house, exercising, doing laundry. And then when I take it, I  feel super guilty about it the entire day and end up with anxiety regarding my adderall use. I get very hard on myself about it. 

I take about 15-25mg per day, depending on whats going on... When I have a 13 hour shift, I average around the 25 mg/day, but more like 15-20 on the average day. 

I am prescribed 10mg IR x3/day (total of 30 mg/day). I have never run out-- in fact, I have a butt ton of extras. \*\*BUT,\*\* I actively want to stop/decrease my usage, and it seems impossible... 

I'm afraid of gaining weight and I'm intimidated by the fatigue that will come with quitting. Are there any tips on how to decrease easily? Suggested weaning? Motivating advice on how to not be so hard on myself?! Please!",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9816228151321411}"

It's so easy to give advice and when I'm doing good, it's all I focus on: how happy I am, how much I lose in a relapse, how much I love myself, how thankful I am for my experiences--no matter how bad, and for my support system.

I lost my best friend around this time last year to addiction. We used to call each other when things would get too bad or too good. It really messed me up losing him, especially to this.

I'm just so tired playing this game. I'm so tired of the lying, the hiding, the constant failure I see in myself for relapsing. This time I feel pretty broken--I'm good about going to rehab when I need it, getting myself into IOP, and getting back into recovery focused communities.

Hi! At the moment I'm on the 268th day since I quit. I wanted to share my story. (because I felt really anxious tonight)

So, here it is.

I finished graphic designer school with A in 2018 November and I applied a job in a local T-shirt printing store. It was small, it was cool and everything. Back in 2017 I already tried cocaine and speed 3-4 times, but I hated the group everyone was depressive and I was like ""nah, that's not for me thanks"" and I didn't do it for a year, I didn't even drink that time.

So back to the Tee printing store. I really liked the atmosphere. My 2-3 colleague was very friendy and outgoing. I felt like hell yeah a cool job and workplace with a good atmosphere. After 2-3 week, we did some overtime with my colleague and then he took out a tray from the table's drawer. He just asked ""do you want some speed?"" I rejected the offer. I rejected it so many times. Maybe after a month when  I went to work on a festival I got 1g from him. I shared it with my mates who work on the festival etc. etc. and I started to use more frequently after that.

I convinced myself that what we do are not ""that"" bad, we work hard every day so a little here and a little there won't cause any harm. Meanwhile one of my colleague's friend (who was a dealer) got home in January and he brought cocaine, it was't doing much for me I just felt a little more focused and maybe more hyped but that's all, nothing extreme like in the Wolf of the Wall Street. He started to come to the store more frequently give us free coke and having fun. In 2019 februar we almost did 1-2 line every day or every other day. 

I was doing fine until 2019 august/september. Where I did a little more speed or it was stronger I don't really know, but I only slept for 2-3 hours and on the next day I did a little speed too just to stay awake, of course, I slept 2-3 hours again. After that I was like fuck this shit I won't do this shit again aaand I didn't do it just once in a party after that. 

In November I had a 1day festival job we brought 1g cocaine with my friend, we used it but something wasn't alright. I got a strange feeling in my testicle and that scared the shit out of me. I told my friends that I got this problem and they said the stuff can't do anything like that. Yeah sure, I was stupid enough and they convinced me but I was more cautious, I was on and off with 2-3 week breaks.

New Years Eve, I promised myself that I won't do anything again, I got 3 weeks and I felt totally fine but again friend came in got some free stuff and I was like why not I did 1-2 line, after our friend who always gave free cocaine for us couldn't bring more my boss and our oldest colleague got a dealer who gave us coke but it wasn't like what the previous one was it was stronger it was cutted up with some ""shit"". I rarely snorted anything from that point but after two weeks I always gave in because they were calling me ""hey you want one?""

I was still good but I got 0.4g for free. I was like ""okay I will sell it or drop it to the bin who the fck cares"" and I did that 0.4g in 3 days (I mean that's not much) but my testicle started to hurt again. This time I realized this is not a fcking joke, this shit causes everything and this was on 4th of july. I started self loathing like ""why I was so stupid that it won't cause anything bad"". I got stressed about the balls but in 2-3 weeks it eventually went away. I had a car accident (no one got hurt) stressed the shit out of me for 2 day and I hooked up with my ex girlfriend just to have sex did it without protection and after the sex we started to talk about what happened to her while she moved to the capital and she was like "" a guy raped me"".

It scared the shit out of me. I was sure that I got some STD, after two week I was sure I got HIV. I had diarrhea for 1 week, dry eyes, sudden back pain, brain zaps. Thanks for God every test came back negative after 2-3 month but I started to get worse, losing my concentration/focus, short term memory got worse, attention span was bad aswell. I was so scared about these thing I couldn't work properly after 2020 october I had good and bad days and fuck worst days of my fckin life.

In December I quit my job because my cognitive and mental state started to became worse. I couldn't undestand the most simple e-mail. There was a time when I picked up the phone and I couldn't understand what the lady was speaking (it was clear and loud and simple). When I quit my boss yelled at me for 10 minutes, he said I'm a fucking insincere motherfucker who was lying all the time and he was so kind to me all the time, he was an agressive shit and a chronic liar (everyone knew that in work)

After that in the first 3 weeks I literally just slept for 12-13 hours. In the last 2 month I started to see some improvements in my energy levels daytime. I started to play games more so my basic mood is better than what it was. So yeah it‚Äôs good, but my cognitive skills, understanding, muscle tension, speaking skills, shor term memory don‚Äôt really improve or I can‚Äôt notice it because the healing is so slow. Sometimes it feels like my brain space out for a while. I got worse in everything, in art, in games. It feels like I‚Äôm 14 years old mentally with a lot of insecurities and it feels like I‚Äôm 50 years old physically. I had a good physique before this and everything was interesting and I my memory was superduper good and it feels like I‚Äôm just a shell of what I was before 1.5 year addiction/abuse.

TL;DR: I fucked up my 2019 and half of the 2020 I quit for good but sometimes I really worried about my cognitive skills and mental clarity. I don‚Äôt have carving or any desire to use anything I even quit coffee. I‚Äôm totally fine without them, I mean I don‚Äôt carve them or anything but I just miss my old self who was productive, who could multitask, who understood everything, who was good in everything. I just feel myself so fucked up. I always hope, I won‚Äôt wake up tomorrow or to be precise won‚Äôt wake up like this tomorrow. I was never like this. I always loved days, waking up early, loved to do anything. I liked to be alone and I liked to socalize and I fucked up everything  in my life with 1.5 year, it‚Äôs just seems so unfair. I didn‚Äôt drink heavily or did more stuff than others and it seems like I‚Äôm the only one who got fucked up like this. I never stole from anybody, I was always a really responsible person. It feels like everything I had left me. It feels like I‚Äôm retarded. It feels like I‚Äôm dead.

Thanks for your time if you read the whole wordsea what I vomitted from the deepest part of my soul. It means a lot to me. 

P.S.: Oh yeah and I forgot to tell about the little neck muscle twitch what I have since august.

I've been in and around AA for two and a half years or so. I also attend a weekly MA meeting which used to meet in person, but is now online. To avoid writing a novel here, I'm just going to lay out the facts. Pot was my biggest issue. I did use other drugs, mostly MDMA, psychedelics and on occasion, speed. I certainly did nitrous a fair bit when I got into psychedelics but rarely did it otherwise. Pot was the thing that brought me to my knees, most definitely. I went to AA because it has a strong community in my area. I've had a few relapses, some with alcohol, others with pot, and a few by doing psychedelics a few times and then coming clean to my group.

Lately, what's really been bugging me is I feel like a fraud in my group because when I think about it, my biggest problem was pot. Now, in all honesty, I noticed that I tended to start to gravitate towards booze when I was free of pot and it started to become a little bit of a problem. But when I think about the first step in any 12 step program ""We admitted we were powerless over X and our lives had become unmanageable"" I honestly don't feel that way about alcohol.

However, I 100% feel that way about pot. I feel completely comfortable in MA and I identify completely with what people say and how it works. When I think about smoking weed, I only think about the first one, not remembering that the next day I will want to do it again and any rule I put in place to control or moderate I will break. I have absolutely no power over my smoking. I am completely powerless when it comes to moderating my pot usage. This has led me to resent my AA groups which in general I love and it makes me want to relapse.

From the ages of 15-20 I was a big party goer and used MDMA, ket, weed, coke and alcohol whilst also forming addictions to smoking, gambling and sex. In the past year I've quit all the drug taking and my addictions with the last time indulging in any being over 6 months ago.

I'm currently in post-acute withdrawal (PAWS) and aside from the depression and anxiety, my lack of cognitive function is really getting to me. I was a really bright kid growing up and now I struggle to even think and speak coherently.

I know that cognitive problems are a common issue in recovery so hold on to the hopes that I can return to my former sharp self, but I'm fearful that I've done permanent damage and from here on after will lack the skills needed to succeed. I'm only 21 and it seems a huge shame to have thrown away my potential through a couple years of naivety.

Do you think my damage is permanent or that I will recover if I keep going??!

As a result, I can only give approximations on my dosages with maybe about 85% accuracy.

I have been addicted to Adderall to the degree of taking it daily since early 2020. Have been on and off for 10 years for special occasions but the pandemic took this to the next degree. I haven't been able to bite the habit but I've been somewhat careful about monitoring my dosage, but this past year saw my daily Adderall intake climb from about 10-30mg/day. The excess amphetamine has heightened insomnia, so I was in a habit of taking zzzquil, melatonin, or any other forms of sleep aid, but found that nothing was doing a great job of ensuring restful sleep. Basically, I couldn't be productive without adderall in the daytime, but couldn't sleep if I did take it.

I made the mistake of acquiring xanax thinking maybe that might help and ofc, this just lead me into an adderall/xanax cycle. I started by taking 15mg 2x adderall per day, and then about 0.5mg xanax at night. This worked at first but of course faded really quickly due to tolerance.

What happened next is what I am extremely concerned about and would really like some insight on if possible, and whether self-rehab/tapering is possible or not given my position of never having been prescribed any of these substances. With the newfound xanax, I found myself 'tapering' the adderall but replacing it with more xanax, and at the time I thought I was helping myself get off adderall but I didn't realize I was digging myself into an even worse addiction. Since acquiring the xanax, I'm now taking something more along the lines of 10mg addy, 2mg xanax per day. However the entire sleepiness effect is gone and I definitely do not want to increase xanax dosage. So basically, I'm now back to square one, but with an additional benzo addiction.

So what do I do? First and foremost I'm scared of not tapering xanax due to me having used it daily for the past 3 months+ (albeit without even feeling too much of the effects b/c it clashed w/ adderall comedown) but the most obvious thing in my head is to cut the benzos and then work on the adderall, but I'm much more afraid of benzo withdrawals. I'm not prescribed so unless I go into detox/rehab I won't have access to better tapering benzos, which I think is my main concern as of now.

If I taper xanax, it would mean I

(1) don't take adderall during taper process. This would kill productivity but help me taper xanax faster as I won't have adderall acting against it in my system. I like this approach as a way to get off adderall but I'm scared with having done adderall daily if it's okay to just cut it out and start a benzo taper.

(2) continue taking adderall to maintain productivity and still taper xanax, but this is also counterintuitive since I would likely have to taper longer and start at a higher dosage with the adderall still in my system and affecting my ability to sleep.

or (3) my scariest alternative is to just cut the xans out. It's not full blown addiction to benzos that scares me. It's withdrawals from having taken it daily for months at seemingly unreasonably high dosages due to my adderall usage that I'm most scared of.

Has anyone been through this and been able to get off on their own without any help? My situation is more dire since I'm not prescribed anything and I can't really say for sure my exact intake but I've started by going from 1 hulk bar 3x a day, to 2/3 a bar 2x a day. Not sure if that's the right start because I know I'm going to have trouble sleeping but I'm just really scared of benzo addiction now that I know what it's like.

If I'm too far gone and need to just go through inpatient detox or something, I'm open to being told so. I just need to know whether or not I can get through this on my own or not.

P.S. On top of everything else, I've been vaping nicotine whenever I'm on adderall (so likely addicted to that as well) and I've been smoking weed daily as well for probably 5 years now. Wonder if anyone can speak to my insomnia as being a result of combining so many substances?",1,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993793964385986}"

Here we go.,"About a month ago (25 days ago to be exact), I posted in [r/StopSpeeding](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/) for the first time. I had gone on my longest and most emotionally deteriorating binge thus far. 33 days of daily use, undernourishment, and sleep deprivation. I was experiencing just unbearable physical, mental, and emotional side effects. Auditory and visual hallucinations, formication, full body pain, paranoia. After a month of pushing my body and mind to the limit, I finally gave up. I wasn‚Äôt getting the high anymore that I so desperately craved. I was just destroying myself at this point. I was picking at my skin, I was down nearly 20lbs, my face looked sunken in, and I couldn‚Äôt trust my brain anymore. So I stopped smoking dope.

I made it a full 11 days before relapsing. The worst part of relapse for me is the fact that my decision is a conscious one. I know I shouldn‚Äôt go and buy dope, but I don‚Äôt stop myself. I waited nights to buy a bag. I made sure to hold onto my money for 3 days so I could buy dope. February 28th, I bought a ball from a plug I'd never used before and got ripped off. Rookie fucking mistake. Salt mixed up with ice, no cool man. Copped a new baggie and I was out of dope 3 days later. Fuck, I dont want to be sober.

My roommate was selling me 2mg xanax bars for $2.50 a pop. I spent my only $8 on 3 bars. Anything to disconnect from reality for a while. I did Xanax 3 days in a row, putting myself and my partner through emotional distress, including multiple suicide attempts and breakups. Fuck Xanax, I hate what it‚Äôs doing to me. I'm done with this shit. This was March 7th.

After 3 whopping days of sobriety, I decide to buy 4 more bars of Xanax after receiving $10 cash for doing a favor for a friend. I was having a hard time sleeping and talked myself into buying Xanax to put me out and of course bought way more than I would‚Äôve needed for that purpose. Stupid fucking addicted brain. I did those Xanax for 2 days. On the second day, I was sexually taken advantage of by my roommate. Raped while too barred out to resist. How fucking pathetic and it RUINED ME. I didn't touch Xanax after this. I still had a whole bar left and I didn‚Äôt do it and threw it out.

After waking up from the Xanax haze and realizing what I had let happen, I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn‚Äôt look my partner in the eyes and I felt so empty and so unsafe in my home, our home. I picked up my best friend and had her stay with me all day so I didn‚Äôt spend my money on dope and I wasn‚Äôt home alone again with my roommate/abuser. We got super stoned and hung out at my apartment all day long. We hung out in the living room because my bedroom was a disaster. Every time my roommate left his room, he kept flirting with us and hinting at us hooking up with him. He would stand and stare at us, giving us awkward eye contact, I felt very uncomfortable in my house and this persisted throughout the evening, and got even worse when it was my roommate and HIS FRIEND trying to fuck my friend and I.

Later that night, my friend and I had talked ourselves into dropping acid together. We both figured it would be fun and it‚Äôd keep my money from being spent on meth or anything worse. My partner passed out on my friend and I, and had his nephew stay the night to ‚Äútrip sit‚Äù us. THIS SUCKED. Midway through my trip, I begin to notice I‚Äôm having some soreness in my throat and begin to connect a few pieces in my brain. I can‚Äôt say anything about it out loud, not while my partner's nephew is listening at least. I am going insane inside my brain. What if my sore throat is STD related? He didn‚Äôt wear a condom and I never took a Plan B. Oh my god, my partner is going to find out. AT this point, I began to spiral. The entire trip, I am fearful of my roommate and highly paranoid. I ask him to leave quietly for the night with his guest, after LOW-KEY freaking out on him for giving me an STD.

This alleviated SO MUCH OF MY ANXIETY AND STRESS. I would finally feel safe in my house again. I opened up to my family and my partner about the abuse I suffered at the hands of my roommate. I opened up about my recent drug use. I opened up about needing help and being ready to get sober and start my life over.

And clean off the Xanax for 4 days.

I used from 17-22. Got clean and fell into NA heavily. Met my partner, built my life, a friend group, career, passions, hobbies, etc. Got super involved in service in my area, great sponsor/sponsee relationship, always doing things that surrounded recovery. My mom is an addict, hasn‚Äôt used her drug of choice in over ten years but still enjoys a drink when she wants, as well as many of my friends who have opted to leave the program. (This is for context later.) 

Almost three years ago one of my best friends ODed. My boyfriend found him. My support group got together to try to cope with the situation. Immediately, people started to make sense of his death by pointing out what he must have done wrong to not survive. This set off the first major red flags for me. My friend didn‚Äôt do anything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. He made a bad choice, one time after working really hard, and he died. Plain and simple. This is when I started to feel like this was all a little too cultish for me. Like if someone in my church died and the people in your textual study group started pointing out things in a book that they must have not obeyed to have ended up with this result, I would be like ‚Äúok bye we are in a cult‚Äù. 

I started backing away from my friend group after that and started hanging out with people who had more clean time. Thought this would be the answer. Then, the unthinkable happened. A family member of my sponsor and my boyfriend got into a physical altercation at AN NA CONVENTION. My boyfriend‚Äôs actions were honestly completely warranted, but it still broke my relationship with my sponsor. She was the last piece keeping me in the fellowship. 

I tried to keep going to meetings, taking service commitments, staying connected. I hated every second of it. I started to share with my psychologist how I was feeling and she suggested that it may be time for me to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù from the program. I was completely floored by that, because I have been told pretty much every day that I‚Äôve been in recovery that if I leave I will die. I decided to take her advice. I walked away. 

Now I‚Äôm still clean, but my friends in the program just don‚Äôt find as much time (or care) for me anymore. My friends that are ‚Äúnormies‚Äù are still living their regular lives and enjoying time out at bars, boozy brunches, house parties, girls night, etc. And I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôve filled up my time with activism and nonprofit work, started a podcast. I‚Äôm super fulfilled with all of that, but my friendships are seriously lacking. I‚Äôm a Pisces, so if you know, you know. 

I‚Äôm just here. Not in the program. Not comfortable enough to risk having a drink right now. Not able to find the connection I once had with friends I held really dear. Everything else in my life is sincerely wonderful. I just don‚Äôt know how, at this point, I really fit in anywhere.

But not every day is like this. My sponsor explained how she measures her willingness; in percentages. I‚Äôve adopted this method. Some days I only have 10% willingness and all I do is throw up a quick prayer at the end of the day thanking my High Power for keeping me sober. Days like today, I‚Äôm sitting at about 90% willingness. So I went to a meeting, am answering phones and working on my step four. 

Whatever your willingness percentage is today, it‚Äôs enough. Be where you‚Äôre at and don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not being ahead of where you are. My timing and expectations leave me destined to be disappointed. Thorough and honest, not fast and furious.

I‚Äôd also like to start by saying that I don‚Äôt come to this sub with any kind of victim mentality. I fully take responsibility for the pain I caused and the BS I pulled when I was drinking and spent every day since going sober to be a better person and hold the guilt I (rightfully) carry. 

This is not a relapse post, I‚Äôm 15 months sober and on the whole, my recovery has generally been pretty positive but this week I was confronted and I‚Äôve been in a shame spiral since Tuesday 

For some context:

When I (32f) was drinking, I was spending 90% of my time alone for a couple of years. I work from home and had moved to a rural place. My now-husband (34m) spent a lot of time out of the country and we we apart so much. I live a little too out the way for visitors to easily come by or just dropping in to see friends on the regular- so after work socializing and in person contact with actual people dried up almost instantly and become not existent when I went full time on my business

At the time, my business was just getting off the ground and the success of that kept me busy. But I found that I was sat alone in my house of an evening, drinking obscene amounts of wine and pretending that I wasn‚Äôt lonely. This became my life night after night whilst I never did anything illegal like drive drunk, i blacked out a lot during 2018-19 

When the Enough Is Enough moment came I had been caught by my now husband talking to someone I shouldn‚Äôt have been. The shit well and truly hit the fan and by some miracle, he still supported my recovery and went to therapy with me and eventually we got married last year. It still amazes me to this day and he‚Äôs wonderful. I can honestly say that that therapy really helped and we‚Äôve been looking forward to the baby we‚Äôre now trying for. 

But this week, I logged into Instagram to a message from a friend of the person that I shouldn‚Äôt have been talking to. I‚Äôve not had any contact with him since that night so this was very much out of the blue. I don‚Äôt have all the facts, but it appears they‚Äôve fallen out and this person is holding me accountable for it.

The message was confrontational and vulgar and contained a veiled threat to expose the nature of my conversations to my husband, not realizing that he already knows and it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been rebuilding from 

I went to school with both of them and they talk about eachother behind eachothers backs with some wild accusations. Because of a conversation before things got inappropriate, I apparently snitched and now its a he-said-she-said situation. 

I don‚Äôt want to be drawn into their fight and it‚Äôs bought up all the shame and guilt from that time and i‚Äôm a mess. Not as much as my husband will be if he is contacted because of this grudge now against me and i‚Äôm scared that all the progress we‚Äôve made will be destroyed 

I know I need to talk to my husband about it when he comes home and hope that he can keep in mind whilst we‚Äôre having that hard conversation that I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong since that day but i‚Äôm a mess with all the dark stuff its brought back 

Anyone else had their past come back when you‚Äôve cleaned up your act? Does it get better?

My situation is alittle wierd. My background is pretty much a troubled highschool with ADHD and being put on methlyphenidate/ritalin which had huge effects on me. It made me extremely angry and violent, along with 0 appetite and screwed up my sleeping patterns which havnt been the same since.

The ritalin lead me to weed which I used to calm me down, which it did. The weed became a huge addiction for me. As I turned 18 I started playing poker machines as my older friends in my.peer group were playing them heaps and winning lots (beginners luck). 

I ended up quitting weed around age 19 but continued gambling. I then entered a rave scene which I started to go to every weekend using drugs like cocaine, ketamine, lsd,nitrous oxide,mdma, lots of alcohol and speed. 

This lead to years of partying for 3-4 days at a time at these rave obviously causing huge damage to me.

So at the 4 year mark of raving I quit gambling which went for 6 years total. I used to spend all day and night at places with slot machines and even if I won huge I would go back later and think about gambling all the time. I could go into how bad it got but it's not the point of this post. 

So when I quit gambling I thought my life would get better and it did for abit but then my addictions lead to extreme cocaine and ketamine abuse which went on for another 2 years. 

Now I am a year sober next week. The thing is I am still slightly adhendonic, very low motivation, I need 12-13 hours sleep to not feel like shit, I still have fried drug thoughts every now and then and I'm just not as snappy as I was. My eyesight has also been effected. 

Will I ever fully recover? Or am I fucked forever? I see people like Robert Downey jnr who probably went through worse then me and look where he is, I know it's possible to succeed but I'm just like what the fuck right now its been pretty much a year sober and I still feel like I only quit a month ago. 

TL;DR - almost made a year sober but still feel sort of fried and low motivation, low brain function, ect

sorry this is a bit off topic but i‚Äôm super frustrated. i‚Äôm in a PHP program right now that is affiliated with a few sober houses. 

in one of the houses, 3 people have just tested positive for COVID. however, they are still admitting new patients to this house, without telling them that we have an outbreak. they have no idea when they arrive that there is an outbreak and that we are quarantining. 

i can‚Äôt think of any laws this would break but i know it‚Äôs definitely fucked up. some people tried complaining to the PHP site (its a different building) and they told them all to leave if they don‚Äôt like it. 

one problem is that the PHP site kind of picks and chooses how ‚Äútied‚Äù they are to the sober house. i think technically, they are not the same entity. so when it‚Äôs convenient for them, they claim to have no official affiliation with the sober houses (everyone who lives in the houses go to this PHP by the way). but when they want to enforce a rule in the houses, the staff tells us that the PHP directors are in charge. so we don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. the administration is a nightmare. 

is there anything i can do? some organization i can report them to? i feel really stuck. this just is so unfair to these new patients. it‚Äôs clear that the program cares about money much more than people‚Äôs health, respect and safety.",7,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996947050094604}"

Then I had a moment of clarity. ""What if its the drugs?"" That thought gave me the the courage to try rehab one more time. 

I threw everything I had at recovering from active addiction, trauma, self destructive behaviors and emotional immaturity. The first night I chose a sponsor he helped me throw away the drugs I had hidden before I left for rehab and that man saved my life. I stopped making my decisions for me for a while and left it up to my sponsor and network. I shared everything I was feeling and cried openly on the floor of meetings. I jumped immediately into step work as I was told the problem wasn't the drugs... it was me.

The path was long, embarrassing, slow. By my one year anniversary I spoke if front of 50 people about my experience and felt my first glimpse of self acceptance. Shortly after that I began acting out in other ways. There was a deep desire to implode after my accomplishment but those around me assured me it was completely normal and made sense since I had no problem with failure. I did, however, have a huge problem with success.

Year 3 I started sponsoring and learned that my deep compassion had a downside when dealing with others struggling with addiction. I had been dubbed ""captain save a hoe"" for my repeated interest in helping every newcomer woman around me. I was indirectly trying to save my mother from years of abuse at the hands of my step father and it was a very difficult habit to break. That savior role transferred to sponsorship and I had to tackle the behavior before I hurt those I was trying to help.

Year 4 I shed tears with my sponsor and learned that strength comes from vulnerability.

Year 5 I lost everything and TRULY found my higher power in love.

Year 6 I found purpose in being a father and every experience I had gave me an incredible versatility in the tools needed for being a parent.

Now, at year 10, I am more excited than ever to experience the life I have been given. A life of despair and sadness has given me gratitude in the smallest of things (like toilet paper.) I can see things that ""normies"" can't. I can feel the hurt behind anger and the comfort behind sadness. I can come onto reddit and empathize with strangers because I know them and they know me... especially here. 

TL;DR I am grateful to be an addict. I am thankful to have the ability to live two lives in one. Although, in hindsight, I wish less people were harmed by my behavior I would not change a single experience I've had that got me to this point. If you are struggling, keep going!

To clarify we are not forcing this on him. He has agreed that is what is best and wants to go on a sober path again. We recognize recovery doesn‚Äôt happen unless the addict is ready. 
Our plan is to research facilities to get him into there in Portland or any other helpful assistance you guys could offer. We‚Äôre new at this so are unsure where we even start!

I take .25 in the afternoon and .25 before bed now trying to taper off but the nausea is so bad and I‚Äôm worried about seizures after reading that‚Äôs a possibility. I feel so tired and nauseous any tips or help would be greatly appreciated please. I need to be able to get out of bed and go to work.,7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9972968697547913}"

He also recently started smoking crack a few months back.

I saw him 2 days ago, looking like a ""hobo"", when he said he'd come to visit me for 2 hours or so.

He only talked in strange analogies and metaphors, constantly.  None of them made sense.  He then started smoking crack in my house and wouldnt stop even when I asked him many times to not do it.

He later wouldn't leave my place, I had to kick him out.  He managed to forced his way inside the first security door then tried lockpocking my front door.  I called the police and they took him away.

He constantly said things like ""we must find the reason of the comprehension and for that we must lay the foundations of our will.  Will that is like a ship starring the the water and following it's passion.  I am 37% sure that this is the real truth.  I am like a lion in a cage, ready to bounce at any moment"" etc etc 

Is it a drug induced psychosis?  Side effect of crack and cocaine?  Is there anything I can do for him that wouldn't place me in physical danger?  How can I interact with him?",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966468214988708}"

My boyfriend‚Äôs (edited for typo, also, fianc√©) younger sister just moved into our small one bedroom apartment with us. I have done everything in my power to make her feel comfortable and safe, as she was living with her emotionally abusive mother. She‚Äôs an adult, but in college and has been very sheltered. We have gotten to know each other over FaceTime since she reconnected with my boyfriend a few months ago after 9 years of no communication since their parents divorce. We have gotten along well, and I was cautiously optimistic about her coming. I‚Äôve been clean since June, and have spent the majority of my time working on myself - learning an instrument, training my puppy to be a therapy dog, cooking, seeing a psychiatrist. Last night my boyfriend spilled the beans rather casually that I was in recovery. At first, his sister tried to be kind about it, but it soon devolved into a full on crying fit whilst she explained that she was scared and worried about this, uncomfortable and wished she would‚Äôve been told this before she came to stay here. She basically suggested that she didn‚Äôt feel safe. I grabbed her some tissues, told her I understand, and we talked to her to comfort her. My boyfriend explained that she wouldn‚Äôt have been brought here if we didn‚Äôt think it was safe. I‚Äôve never been met with this reaction when I‚Äôm open about my recovery. She has no experience with addicts or folks in recovery. It‚Äôs like she pictured this bogeyman and pigeon-holed me into this identity she‚Äôs seen in media. I stayed in our room most of the night crying, I felt as though I could never escape my past, and I‚Äôm permanently damaged, even though I‚Äôm trying my best and being vulnerable. She hasn‚Äôt said anything to me about it since, so I feel kind of gaslit. My boyfriend wants to encourage her to apologize to me but in my opinion, she‚Äôs an adult and needs to come to that by herself. I‚Äôm uncomfortable feeling judged in my home, but my boyfriend insists that I stay here and not go stay with my parents an hour away. I don‚Äôt want to leave my puppy, anyway. We‚Äôre planning on sitting down with her later and explaining why her reaction hurt our feelings. I can‚Äôt feel so ashamed in my home, but I don‚Äôt think she has anywhere to go, and my heart just feels heavy. I‚Äôm hurt, I‚Äôm upset, and I‚Äôm doing my best to be patient and compassionate, but I can‚Äôt help that no matter my sweet ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù sign I made, my prepping the apartment and clearing out space, my previously good relationship with her... she has this idea about me now that I can‚Äôt purge. I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my job to convince anyone that I‚Äôm on the straight and narrow - in my own home, and when it feels like unnecessary emotional labor that I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth for. I agreed to taking in an adult, not a child. She doesn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. We can‚Äôt afford to send her to a motel or rent her a room, we‚Äôre paying for her food and trying to give her everything she needs. She doesn‚Äôt have a license, I‚Äôve offered her my bike to get around. Am I being unreasonable in feeling so upset? Am I right to expect an apology? Any advice? Do you have any similar experiences you can share? Thanks in advance.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971272349357605}"
