2020-04-29 10:21:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/gaacu2/meditation_is_boring/,"""Meditation is boring""","Hi all, looking to get some advice. I work at a month long inpatient rehab. Part of our programming is having a meditation class as the first group of the day (8:15am). Traditionally, either one of the instructors guides the clients through it or we put on a guided one from YouTube (no more than 10 min). Then we read/discuss the daily reflections from both AA and NA for that day.
Now with multiple groups we have had, they say that it is the most boring class we have and that they would rather do something else (like motivation) instead of meditation.

I guess my questions are: is it common practice to do meditation in other rehabs? How can I make it so that it is not so 'boring'? I'm just not sure. This last group that we had was the most unready/unwilling group that I've ever seen and maybe their comments/constant complaining are skewing my perception. 

Oh, the clients that we have are at the very beginning stages of sobriety- ie, many shot up in the parking lot before coming in and are here because their probation officer is making them come. I'm sure that has some effect.

Edit: I am not in recovery, I am in alanon and have lost family to this disease, so I listen to what my managers and the peer sponsors at my facility say. I take my cue from those in long term recovery so that's why I am here....",1

2020-04-28 01:44:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/g9hhii/severe_marijuana_withdrawal/,Severe Marijuana Withdrawal,"Severe Withdrawal

Okay so i’m going to start off by saying that I am an 18 year old female and I’ve smoked like 4-6 times a day for about a year now. While herb was my main go to I would shake it up with edibles (don’t ever eat 500mg thinking you’re a god, because you aren’t and it will kick your ass), wax (dabs), and I had a cart. I don’t have a big knack for alcohol and zero interest or experimentation with harder drugs (save a time or two with coke at party or shrooms). Two weeks ago I got pretty viscously ill. All my symptoms at the time pointed to the severe flu. I’m starting to feel a little better after being sick for about four days (no weed during this time) and then 4/20 rolls around. Self control was nonexistent for me as 4/20 turned into a 3 day event where I was thoroughly fucked up with my girls. After the third day we cool it and I am having severe nausea and vomiting. I’m super confused at this point as I rarely have negative reactions to marijuana save the occasional nausea or munchies. I assumed I somehow got a flu like illness once again. I decide that during this time it would be a good time to try and quit or at least take a giant tolerance break because the effects of weed on a girls bank account became absolutely ridiculous. I’m a waitress so I’m also out of work for the most part until this COVID lockdown lifts. 

A week following the last time I smoked has been the worst of my life. I have lost 10-15 pounds from the complete inability to stomach or keep food down (it actually repulses me rn). I had horrendous night sweats and chills constantly. The nausea was probably the worst part, right?

I was largely mistaken. 

The last three days I have had almost completely debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. I’ve never had a panic attack in my life until recent events and let me tell you it is not fun. I was fully convinced I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. My blood pressure was 200/100 ( I am almost always at 122/80 ), and a pulse of 140-150. The hospital just did standard procedures (lab, EKG, covid test), all came back good and indicating i’m perfectly healthy. Got fluids for dehydration and a pat on the back. They told me that they were fully convinced all of this was related to a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, which is basically a really bad reaction to marijuana that causes severe nausea, vomiting, and all the jazz. As I am writing this post, exactly a week from when I stopped, I am beginning to feel a fragment of better which is a huge step from the complete nightmare this past week has been. 

So yes I have just written a book about marijuana withdrawals, but I thought I would put this out there so people going through similar circumstances know they aren’t alone. Don’t be afraid, put down the blood pressure cuff, and stop taking your pulse (unless medically needed). The symptoms regarding withdrawal are really stigmatized and it is believed that the most you’ll get from quitting is insomnia and some vivid dreams. I have had both of these symptoms, but also much much worse. It is not fun. And as I have all of this excruciating freetime being unemployed for the time being and stuck without a mental crutch to smoke, I have begun to realize just how destructive my dependence on weed was to my mental health. Do I still love pot? Absolutely. I’ve had some of the most fun of my life, and the most spiritual connections with people while smoking. I’m in no way judging anyone, I actually envy you for not having these symptoms. But for whoever is going through a similar situation, it gets better. It took me 7 days to realize that after googling every illness and symptom known to man to try and figure out what is going on with my body. I wish I had someone to reassure me or a post like this to ease my mind. 

Withdrawal is real, and just because you personally don’t experience it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Everyone’s experiences will differ, whether this be psychologically or physically. I used weed as a crutch to not have to take antidepressants and keep my mood up. Happy customers, happy tips.    

This experience has taught me just how hazed and cloudy my judgement and moods were while smoking so frequently and without restraint. Even though I feel like absolute shit right now, I have already seen improvements with my optimism, motivation, and personal relationships. So to anyone who is going through the ongoing struggle of a tolerance break, quitting (and staying that way), or having mere curiosity, just know that your pain and experiences are validated. You do not need and justification for how you feel or how your body reacts to substances. You are brave and can endure this journey if you center yourself. 

I hope this post helped someone, apologies again for the damn novel.",7

I was always the black sheep. I got caught up selling drugs at an early age and was an addict by the time I was 16. I am after many failed attempts 12 months clean and it has everything to do with a promise I made my mother.

When other family members rolled their eyes and gossiped the way any addict's family does, my mother god bless her soul, was always in my corner. On mother's day last year I was dead broke... Had spent every dime I spent fifty hours a week slaving away on blow. Heart broken and torn I gave her a note which said I would give her 365 days of sobriety. It hurt a little when she laughed at the gesture but meant the world to me, and her, when I followed through. 

I challenge anyone lurking on this sub or struggling with failed attempts to do the same. I know not everyone has the privilege of doing so but if you are blessed enough to have the opportunity the only question you have to ask yourself is why not. She loves you.

Using/doing will feel intensely euphoric for a short time, and it will ALWAYS be an option. Pleasure is pleasure, it can't be intellectualized away. 

I felt hopeless, I could not see an alternate path. The only way to make the intense cravings disappear the other day was to give in to them. Which *sort of* worked. 

Now I'm struggling with the fact that the *clock has merely been reset*. The desire quelled, but it is just winding back up until life get's intolerably \[insert negative emotion here\] again.

I tried some yoga, listened to music, but the only thing that feels comforting right now is sitting on the couch under a blanket, closing my eyes. If the drugs were in front of me, I’d take them. But there’s too much effort in picking up right now. Which is weird, but I won’t question it. The using thoughts have been minimizing, but they still linger quite often. I want to stay clean.

But I don’t like this. I don’t like feeling like I’m on top of the world one day, and then like nothing the next. It’s hard to explain. And it’s confusing. Maybe it’s because of the world being on lockdown, maybe it’s just depression.

I'm 28 and I was addicted to IV heroin for 9 years and then IV fentanyl and cocaine for 3. I overdosed 7 times, I was homeless, stealing from my family and stores, selling their property and mine, lying to family and loved ones, I got arrested twice, and I got assaulted by a dealer. I was severely underweight, I picked deep holes everywhere on my body and face, I hardly slept or showered, my eyes and face were sunken in, my eye was unevenly open(not sure why), and I had no period. I was honestly hoping to die. I had no friends and no one to talk to.. I was alone with my drug addiction and mental health problems. I thought I didn't have the strength to get better.

I got really bad really fast towards the end and asked my family for help. My mom quit her job so she could take me home to take care of me while I was in the initial recovery stage(along with other types of support systems). 

Today is 1 year clean! The longest I've ever been clean in my life! My skin is healed, I gained weight, I'm working and going to school for computer programming and taking mixed martial arts classes! 

I messed up 3 times in the beginning but it just made me realize more how much I appreciate my health now that I had it coming back.

I know a lot of you are in recovery but I still want to say this because it's just good to I think.

Number one most important thing is a support system. It took me 12 years to realize that I can't do it on my own and it's a daily battle.. even after one year of being clean, and will be for the rest of my life. I need professionals and a community of people to guide me because that little voice in my head that tries to convince me to get high needs to be kept in check, and it can get very tricky distinguishing that addiction voice and reality for me. Support, and keep yourself occupied.

""An idle mind is the devil's playground""

Best quote I heard from my therapist. Boredom and giving myself too much time is when the thoughts start to surface for me.

No matter how bad it gets and how much you think that there's no way of returning to a good life because of how badly you've gone down.. it's always possible if you take the steps to do it for yourself. Even when you mess up, don't stop trying and pushing.

Anyway, here are just some pictures of before and after. The one I took when my lip had an infection (from picking at it with a dirty needle, cocaine makes you do weird things) and I had to go to the hospital because it had spread and I was feverish. It was the first day of my 1 year journey to get sober. The other one is right before it got bad really fast, but my eyes are sunken in and I just look sad.

We have been together for 4 years (we have no life /finance attachments, live separately). I knew about them doing blow at parties which I wasn't really cool with, but I knew that opportunity would only come once in a while.

They struggle with other addictions and dependencies (tobacco, gambling, alcohol) and have a rough upbringing which was never dealt with and I don't know the true extent of. But I do know I'm one of the only supports in their life. 

I didn't realize how bad this addiction was until recently. They do blow daily. Barley take time off. Destroyed their reputation with school and work. Have run out of money, and taken money from myself and family members (until I knew what was happening and cut off giving money) and have absolutely NO control of themselves. If they have the money and time to binge on blow and any other addcitions, they wil. 

After a recent binge it seems they want to stop, but I'm not sure if it will last. They say they don't want to do it anymore but also talk about other means of getting high/occasional use. I'm not sure if they even realize the impact its having on their life and relationships..They recently had a very harmful weekend where they all but ruined every part of their life within 48 hours. Physically, mentally, financially, socially really did damage. They felt extremely terrible after and expressed a lot of disgust with themselves but I don't know if it will stick or if its enough of a ""rock bottom"" to keep them wanting to stay sober.

Also, due to me putting up with some terrible treatment (which i made excuses for with their drug use), they also are very harsh and emotionally abusive. I know this is just because of drugs but Im afraid I will never get my partner back. They are a really great, loving person but now since this drug abuse they have turned into someone I don't recognize... 

Any advice on how to be a better partner through recovery? or if this will ever end...?

  
So far, I've tried to - cut off money and supporting with food/finances, set clear boundaries and have stopped engaging in any behaviour. Also have been there without shame, judgement or ridicule when they are honest and need someone to talk to. 

I strongly believe and recognize addiction is an illness, not a choice. so that is why i have stuck around. 

I've tried to look online for stories about partners in relationships with addicts but it has been really hard to find things that aren't EXTREME cases (though I know this could easily lead there)

Any advice, experience stories etc  is welcome and would really help.",4

Obviously turning from a C student to a A student was nice, but I fell in love with the feeling of wanting to do everything at once, feeling empowered, having a flood of euphoria rush into my brain and I never wanted it to go away. It quickly became a everyday thing, I would take 20mg instant release and over some months it increased to 40 mg a day. I also lost 20 pounds and felt so confident and my self confidence skyrocketed. After about a year is when I started to experience the side effects when I would come off of the drug everyday. Heart palpitations, extreme depression when not on the drug, not caring about anyone or anything, constantly feeling numb, panic attacks, I was just miserable after taking it. This didn't stop me though, I'd wake up every day and take it and then end up regretting it towards the end of the day and swearing I would stop because the repercussions were UNBEARABLE. It was this endless everyday cycle that kept on going until I realized I forgot what kind of person I was before I started taking adderall. I quit cold turkey and would stay clean for a couple weeks but crave the rush again and start my using all over again. I have a very addictive personality so whenever I quit adderall, I started to drink. It started off as wine every weekend, and now it's up to 4-5 times a week of drinking equivalent to a whole water bottle full of vodka each day I would plan on drinking. I have no self control I just constantly want to feel something, and I have no pleasure in being sober. My drinking problems have been like this for almost a year, and are not stopping. I'm very into fitness and my self image and this problem has caused me to gain a lot of weight and feel insecure, but that won't make me quit. I got hooked on taking adderall everyday and now I'm hooked on booze. Its getting worse because about one month ago I started to get into a routine, I would take adderall for work.. get my euphoric kick and then to deal with the depression and anxiety, I would drink excessively at night. Shit, I did it yesterday. I just want to be happy without abusing my mental and physical health.. I'm even taking Prozac and Wellbutrin (anti depressants) to help deal with it all but I feel like I haven't even given it a chance because I hardly take them and I'm popping addy's and vodka every other day. I just want help but I hate being vulnerable and I don't like accepting that I have a problem, but this is the first step. I am only happy and interested in doing anything when I'm intoxicated, and when I take my pill. How do I fix this? It doesn't help either that I'm overly impatient.. I've tried quitting and I've seen myself get mentally and physically better but I just end up fucking it up again. I also have a little bit of a eating disorder so that's what I love about adderall's effects.. It's almost as if now I just take it so I won't eat more than 500 calories in a day because I want to lose the weight I'm gaining from the thousands of empty calories in the vodka. I just don't know where to turn to, and would like to talk to others about the hard struggles of addiction, and possibly a way to get better.",35

In 2018 I left a toxic relationship of 7 years that took up almost all of my 20's. I went straight back into an old alcohol problem I had managed to bury while I sat in that different kind of hell (narcissistic sociopath). The heavy ""celebratory"" drinking went on for a year until I met my now boyfriend. We drank together for awhile but I quit drinking right around New Years, with one night of drinking making an appearance in mid March and my partner has since become sober as well.

I was so happy to be able to wake up the day after that night in March and just know I was DONE. It was so clear to me after that one evening. I have about 15 years of going back and forth with alcohol under my belt at 30 so it is time if I am going to save myself. I have been doing yoga every day for weeks and feel physically better then I have in almost two years. I have been floating on that cloud for a whole month until 4 or 5 days ago.

I fell asleep on the couch and when I got up to go to bed around 330 AM I was not able to go to sleep. I started thinking the way the brain does in these moments and got myself into a full blown panic attack. Sobbing, worrying, sitting up unable to calm myself down. Ever since then I have been unable to relax. I am struggling with being around people, struggling to think positively with my rational brain, and dealing with a racing heart at random times.

I believe I have had anxiety since I was a teenager but have successfully ignored it with alcohol for a long time. How do I move past this stage? Because I want to believe this is just a stage.

Is anyone using online therapy with any success? I feel pulled to speak to a professional or attend a meeting but it is a hard time to navigate that.

I just discovered this group and am really excited to join in and share empowerment with each other.

Thank you all for being here and thank you in advance for any advice you have for me.",2

Staying sober while everyone else is drinking can be an extreme challenge. Many people think of peer pressure as something that happens in high school, but it can happen at any point in life. Sometimes the events that adults attend--think work events and birthday or dinner parties--can pose some of the hardest challenges, especially because these events are where we bond with peers. Especially in the first year, stay away from events that could trigger you into drinking or other drug use.

There is power in numbers. If you have to attend a work or social event where you suspect that alcohol may be present, make sure you bring a wingman--at least one friend who doesn't drink or use.

What can you do when you find yourself suddenly in a situation where everyone else is drinking or smoking? Suck down your iced tea and get out of there. Part of your proactive exit strategy means making sure you can easily leave. This may mean arranging alternative transportation--a taxi or a drive home with a sober friend.

Action for the Day

List at least one way you can be more watchful in recovery. This could be as simple as avoiding certain events or people for a while longer. It could be changing your thinking to avoid becoming overconfident and taking unneeded risks.

Thought for the Day

Probably have spent 3-4 years inpatient in various treatment centers, hospitals, psych wards, or jails cumulatively. I'm in another rehab now, maybe my 14th? In the past I was told I had OCD as a kid, anxiety disorders, and depression. This current place is now saying (the first time I have ever heard this) that I have ADHD and Aspergers and that the reason I got addicted and can't stay clean is because I'm on the autism spectrum. I mean, I always kinda thought that I was a little different from my peers, but being told I have an 'autism mind' just doesn't sit right with me. But I know thats because of my own conditioned beliefs about that label, I guess. So this place is having me work with an autism coach, and honestly it rubs me the wrong way. I feel like I am being spoken to like a child, or someone who can't manage themselves, or someone who is just defective. But a lot of that is probably just in my head, as I know these people want to help me. But I still hate the fact they are telling me I have aspergers... haha. 

Has anyone else been told they are on the spectrum and struggle to identify with that? If you are on the spectrum can you please explain to me how identifying this has helped you in your recovery/life? I honestly feel kinda bad about it, I've just been collecting a bunch of labels over the years and now I have two new ones, and the autism one is by far my least favorite yet.

Tried other sleep meds and those didn’t help but my doctor prescribed .5 mg Xanax a night and it definitely knocked me out. Started around 3 months ago and at first I wouldn’t take them every night. Sometimes even a week or two. 

This past month during quarantine however I was bored so just started popping those fuckers. As in popping 5 in the middle of the day and then 4 the next night and so on with all the left overs. Drank a little, even smoked on it one night and felt great. Felt good at first but then I started feeling irritable on it at night and picking random fights that I never would have. I just felt emotionless and mean. I think the breaking point was when I took two and started drinking. I was unable to sleep and had the worst headache. I just started bawling to my boyfriend at like 3am. Thankfully he’s really understanding but we both decided it’d be best for me to come off. 

Didn’t really think I was doing too much damage at the time but coming off now feels awful. And I very obviously see I should probably never touch another benzo. I didn’t have anxiety before this but now I am getting these extreme random surges where it feels like my heart is going to rip out my chest. It makes me feel sick and it’s only the second day not taking them. The day before that I had two, and the day before that I believe I didn’t take any? I’m also feeling irritable the past couple days. It doesn’t help that it’s quarantine and I have a lot of time to overthink on things. I’ve been prescribed adderall as well for years for adhd but now when I take my adderall I feel it’s making the anxiety worse. But If I don’t take my adderall I feel an empty type of feeling. 

Will these symptoms go away quickly? Is there anything to alleviate them? I don’t want these to impact my relationship and I know it’s my responsibility to fix the mess I created. I hate leaning on those close to me for support because I feel like a burden but trying to just ignore it or get over it doesn’t feel like an option so I’m struggling to deal with it on my own. Might have an online video chat with my therapist, but any advice or personal experience would be much appreciated.

Backstory: 
I stopped using cocaine in 2013 after a 12 year, pretty much every day abuse of cocaine and alcohol. I should mention that AA/NA/CA didn't really work for me, so I kind of worked myself out of this mess myself. I kept drinking for about 2 more years, until I was able to dial it back to 2 drinks a few times per week. I had a short slip a few years ago, but nothing more than a few days. 

A few weeks ago, I stopped all drinking and smoking weed. And even though I was a bit irritable and sometimes wanted a drink, I felt somewhat ok.
 
Over the last days and week though I started to feel very anxious, sad and depressed. Without any obvious reason or trigger. I had cocaine using dreams over the last 3 nights, waking up with that feeling of being high. I feel strong cravings for cocaine during the day, coming and going, and I even felt this morning the ""itching of coke bugs on my back and legs. I am anxious, very sad and depressed and even a bit paranoid over who is observing me and what their intentions are. I can't make sense of this - why is this happening now, years after again? I'd understand alcohol & weed because that's what I stopped. But why again this? 

Has anybody experienced something similar and do you have any advice for me? Thank you.

I had fallen into addiction due to a lot of traumatic events that took place that year and was still struggling with confusing emotions from childhood abuse that was mainly psychological and emotional. Adderall and vyvanse were my main drugs of choice. I had entered into an abusive relationship where he initially introduced me to self medicating. Luckily I stayed away from the harder drugs. I had so much bad going on at the time i couldnt stand being sober for more than 10 minutes. The withdrawels could get awful in part due to not wanting to face the reality of what was going on. I ended up getting clean on my own and with zero support at the time. It was incredibly hard and im truly glad I did. Lately i have found myself having such a strong craving for it and just not wanting to be sober at all whatsoever. I had a repressed memory come to light a few months ago and more are fighting their way to the surface. I quite the job i loved in Jan. because i reported my entire management team for sweeping other coworkers sexual harrasment/assualts under the rug. I knew even with a policy against it I would face retaliation. I also had a suicide attempt at the end of Jan. 2 surgeries and my grandfather passed away in early February. Just a lot of other stuff going as well. Realizations about myself and trying to accept and cope with it. Its been difficult. Im finding little to big things to keep me sober. Trying to focus my productivity in other areas of my life that could use it. Im hoping I'll pull through this without relapse.

My recovery has been shakey from the start, I thought I could justify drinking socially and smoking weed occasionally because those aren’t my “drugs of choice”, coupled with not participating in a recovery community, but I can’t help but believe that’s what helped pave the way for my relapse with my actual drug of choice.
The scariest part of it all is how normal it felt, the whole procuring and using- like I didn’t miss a beat after all this time. Which just solidifies the fact that I was never clean in the first place, despite not using the drug.
Just needed a place to vent so thank you for letting me do that here; I’m hoping everyone is doing well and staying strong- I’m trying to do the same.",3

2020-04-12 15:35:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/g0368z/helping_my_mother_in_the_time_of_covid/,Helping my mother in the time of Covid,"I am working to get my mom somewhere closer to sobriety during this time. She’s a decades long drinker in her 60s and had a couple of major incidents about ten days ago: after some confusion and dangerous lapses in time my dad (also a drinker but less extreme) started to draw down her daily wine intake and take away her car keys. This prompted her to take off a couple of nights later, wandering in the street looking for a ride to liquor stores. She was very wasted when the police picked her up, because she had her own hidden stash of course (plus she has a Xanax prescription of .25 up to four per day, that she was sometimes abused). 

I drove in from out of town despite my inclination to avoid any contact due to the virus. The following 10 days or so have been rocky and intense. I’ve had rages and emotions along the way that I’ve never had before. I’ve also developed a kind of severe blood pressure issue suddenly too (seeing Dr Thursday).  

Stoic father has been helpful and supportive in his own way; he still takes off for an occasional drink but has been at less than a tenth his norm.  Meanwhile, due to the Covid issues, we have very limited resources.  I have been a one man physical and substance abuse rehab without any of the real knowledge. My sister is a PA and went through therapy at a young age, but can’t risk coming over. So I’ve had tons of phone talks w her and with my aunt (moms sister) who also went through rehab a few years back. She would be a great support but my mom is angry and doesn’t want to talk to much of anyone. 

Anyway, we’ve weaned her down to 4oz of wine a day and give her a .25 Xanax when she asks (usually 2 per day). She had been at two bottle a day for the last many months. Her strength and mental clarity have improved dramatically. Like a new person. But her attitude is still angry and depressive of course.  She has been completely hostile to the idea of quitting all together and it’s been hard to get councilors or programs to even deal w us at all until she’s in that place. It seems at times that they’re saying, “well you have to let this old woman who can’t think straight at all suffer her own consequences and then decide to get better.” Which to me sounds like “you’ll just have to let her die.” 

As of today we’ve brought the new plan: commit to no drinking for 28 days (it’s all locked up, she has no keys, I’ll be with her the first few days, then my dad will take over).  She must have weekly phone counseling and now I’m looking into other resources we’ll want her to commit to. Some sort of zoom AA meeting maybe 1-2 a week. She’s fighting the whole idea and sticks w this idea of just wanting a glass of wine per night. But I think she’s coming around to the idea of going 28 days clean, if for nothing else, the alcohol is telling her she’ll be able to have a little bit again after the 28 days.  

It’s not a perfect plan but I feel like, with the limited resources, and all the mitigating factors, it’s the best we got.  

Would be happy to hear any feedback or suggestions or questions.",2

My name's Asp (Using my D&D character name just in case) and I'm an addict. Beginning of March I ended up going in to work intoxicated from the previous day's bender and, given how I had been treating my body with substances (alcohol primarily in this situation), I collapsed. My boss gave me a ride home and I was put on short term disability. That evening, I drank an entire handle of vodka and ended up calling the EMTs on myself to get help. I was at 5x the legal limit and I had slept so I very nearly killed myself. They kept me overnight, and, upon returning home, I justified buying a pint of vodka as a way to ease the detox. I then proceeded to take some pills that were given to me and overdosed on Fentanyl. Very nearly died again, but I didn't need to be hit with Narcan (thank goodness). I've been an addict since I was probably about 19 years old, varying from methamphetamine to opioids to alcohol and everything in between. My wife died from an accidental overdose almost five years exactly from now (4/25/15) and I went through some intense trauma. Not trying to justify my behavior; just giving some context. I am currently in intensive outpatient treatment and have 37 days sober from alcohol, but 20 days sober overall because I found a half a pill and I took it, once again justifying it to myself that I was stressed out about money (still haven't received a disability check, I have about $30 to my name right now, and that was borrowed from my sister). Needless to say, I'm a bit of a wreck. I'll be graduating from IOP in about a week and a half and I am encouraged/required to attend groups outside of my IOP. Unfortunately for me, 12-steps just doesn't work for me. I am not a spiritual person, I am a hard atheist, and, while I have made MANY attempts to attend multiple types of groups, I have found them more triggering than helpful. My counselor provided me with this group and I'm hopeful I can find some folks similar to myself and maybe some direction/guidance on how to proceed. I look forward to meeting you all, and I'm proud of each and every one of you for being in recovery and having the strength to fight this god damned disease every day of your lives.  


TL;DR: Addict to everything, losing support group in less than two weeks, can't get myself to do 12-step and could use some help",5

Can a brain recover from that? I know serotonin comes back to normal levels after a while but it feels as if the unpleasant experience was hard wired to my brain. The closest description I can give is that A) I feel emotions much stronger and it's harder to regulate them then before. B) it's as if I feel parts in brain are tight and contacted as they were during the bad experience.

I have been clean from drug abuse for over 3 years.  I specifically abused benzodiazepines that were originally prescribed to me.  My addiction was out of control and I am happy to say that I have been on the straight and narrow with regard to my recovery path.  I attend NA meetings regularly and feel really proud of my accomplishments.  That said, I still drink occasionally.  When I drink, I limit myself to two drinks and I do this once a week.  Setting boundaries has helped me and there are many weeks where I do not drink at all.  I really enjoy traveling to breweries and learning about craft beer specifically.  I do not smoke or use otherwise. 

NA, of course, considers alcohol a drug.  It is a little awkward to be in a space where I feel like I am doing a great job but also struggle to be honest about my choice to continue drinking occasionally.  I am also not a believer in a higher power and struggle with the religious elements in NA.  It is critical do turn your faith over to god, or recognize that you have no control and this does not speak to me personally despite it's proven success rate.

When I was 14 I got sent away to a long term treatment center. After 18 months there, I came home in January. I had 13 months of sobriety (or at least abstinence) under my belt... up until last week. I bought a dab cart two weeks ago and sat on in because I was scared to use it. But sobriety had stopped meaning anything to me. I wasn’t sober for myself I was sober for my family, because the idea of sobriety means so much to them.  One night I just said fuck it and hit the cart before I went to bed. I spent the next three days getting high. Today is my first full day sober after my relapse. I feel so much guilt and shame right now because I broke promises and my parents trust. 

Here’s why I need help. I don’t know what to do. My biggest struggle right now is if I should tell my parents or not. A regular high school kid wouldn’t tell there parents if they got high, but then again my situation isn’t exactly regular. I am confident that I can move forward and be sober. But I don’t know if telling my parents would be beneficial or detrimental. It would absolutely effect my living situation because my parents are divorced and my dad would blame my relapse on the fact that I’m at my moms house.

The thing that made me decide to quit was finding out I was pregnant on 03/08/2018. The second I saw the positive pregnancy test I flushed the last of my heroin ($250 worth, I was using over 2 grams a day!). I was already going to methadone clinic for about 6 or 7 months at that point, but I was still using on top of that. I continued treatment, counseling, and attending meetings, I moved away from the area I was living at the time and transferred clinics. During my pregnancy I had to go up a little in my dose due to my body metabolizing it faster, so I went from 120mg to 140mg and after having my son in 10/2018 I went back down to 120mg. I am now at 13mg! I'm hoping to go down 1mg every week or every other week until I get down to nothing. I've had many failed attempts at getting clean over the decade I was using, but I always gave in to the cravings. I wasn't avoiding the people, places, & things that triggered me... Now I can say with 100% honesty that I have not had a single craving since the day I stopped. Knowing that I was going to be a mother, and have someone depend on me to be my best for them, has completely saved me and given me the strength I needed to stay clean. I am at the point that I feel physically ill when I think or hear about alcohol or drugs. I have reconnected with my family, who I had pushed away and screwed over during my addiction. I was doing so many things I am ashamed of just to get my fix every day. Now I wake up and see my beautiful little boy and life is wonderful! And I am doing what I love now, working with reptiles for breeding and educational programs. I own so many reptiles that I have always dreamt of owning, but never would have been able to afford before... I just wanted to share this, since I'm extremely proud of myself and what I have accomplished during the past 2 years. And to anybody struggling to stay clean, find something that truly makes you happy and do that whenever you have the urge to get high. And stay strong! Things will get better. Life is worth living happily.",85

I've been reading a lot of posts on reddit about others trying to quit taking adderall. I've read a few posts that made me feel a bit better in the sense that everyone who has been taking it has had similar experience to my brother. 

My brother is 35 and has been taking Adderall for about10 years I think, he lives with my parents and even though he has tried to move out and have a job, he always comes back to live with my parents. He used to be super outgoing, funny, fun, and lovable. I think he has overdosed on pills for the past 2 years because his behaviour has changed dramatically ever since. He hasn't had a job in maybe 3-4 years. He's isolated in his room, stopped socializing, hanging out with the family, and always serious. When he takes adderall (90mgs), he becomes super attentive, focused, talkative and sweet. He then sleeps for like 3 days in a row and then the effect goes away.  After that, gets really irritated and some times rude to people around him. He recently started experiencing symptoms of anxiety, hallucination, extreme fear as if someone was following him like the cops and fear of any electronic device, and extreme depression. He attempted to end his life once by taking multiple pills I think because he is tired of taking them (in 2018).  

He really wants to stop taking them. He now accepts that he has a problem and even went through this phase where he started having faith and believing in God and was so serious about turning his life around. He wanted to change his life by getting a job, exercising, reading self- help books and was so motivated to do so. Right now I'm super worried because he told my parents like 2 weeks ago, to take the pills away from him and to only give him 60mgs. A few days later he asked for the bottle of pills because I think he started to have withdrawals but my parents didn't give it back. He usually would go down to eat and talk to my mom while on the 90 doses. Before, if the effect would wear off, he would just go to his room and not talk to anyone. For the past 6 months, he has become more angry and verbally abusive to my mom. TMI, sorry. My mom calls me about 10 times a day and talks to me about every single thing he does and I only get more worried because I don't know how to help. 

We tried getting him a therapist, he had a few sessions and eventually canceled them because he was prescribed more meds to treat anxiety and depression. He says he doesn't want to take more pills, he wants to stop them because they all have side effects. For the past week and a half, he's been taking 60mgs instead of 90. This is the reason I'm writing this post because he hasn't eaten in 3 days, he's been on a lower dose and he now goes out to drive twice a day for about 15-20 minutes but doesn't talk to my parents. We don't know where he goes or what he is doing. My mom thinks he's going out to buy food, or to get distracted. I fear that he is buying pills from someone else and trying to hide it from them. But my mom says that he always goes out to smoke after he takes 90mgs and he would be awake for days so she's hopeful that he is dealing with this on his own. Any thoughts or advice, please? What can we do to help him? 

Thank you so much for reading my story! <3",2

Came off methadone cold turkey.,"Hey guys! 18 months today. Kind of a bummer I can’t pick up a keytag at a meeting, but I have friends willing to meet me for one. I came off of 120mg of methadone cold turkey, detoxed in jail and shit my pants for 17 days straight. 
With everything happening right now I am beyond grateful I’m not out there in active addiction. I couldn’t even comprehend how people are able to get well during these times, stores are closed so how are you gonna shoplift for that gift card, hahah, but we all figure ways out. We lost a friend in my area yesterday, he had the same clean time as me and overdosed. We have to hold on to our clean dates so so tight right now. 
Tomorrow my best friend and I are traveling to the Smokey Mountains to quarantine in a cabin :) I love being able to travel today — I can just get up and go and not have to worry about being sick or bringing methadone with me and sleeping the whole time. 
I was furloughed from my salon today for 30 days, she’s a RN in the ER and they are cutting back hours because it’s so slow, so we’re able to go for a week. 
Hope everyone is doing well, if any women need someone to talk to I’m here.",1

Another drug that became a large problem in my life was MDMA pills and powder, of which I left behind in 2019 after a year of taking a large quantity of it.

On April 8th I will be 16 months clean and sober! When I compare how I was to how I am now, during my active use I was on an endless quest towards escaping reality. I was running away from myself. Now what I'm doing is running towards myself. I'm building myself to be a better person, a better daughter, and a better mother.

I am currently working towards attaining a master's degree in social work (MSW) so I can ultimately work with people that were and are just like us. I want to share my story and strength to help those that are struggling to transcend their addiction.

I need your help! In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master's of Social Work (MSW), I am conducting a research study that involves a survey that I have designed about the attitudes and beliefs about addiction among those in recovery and/or active addiction. I need approximately 50 people that, again, are either in recovery or still using. So far I only have 2 :( My original plan to distribute these surveys in person to members of local AA groups fell through because of the disruption and chaos caused by the current world crisis. The survey is brief and quick, and **100% completely confidential**. I'm including the link below. Your participation is greatly appreciated. Thank you for all your help!

I told myself that if I only went to the bar close to my house, then I wouldn't be driving all over town drunk, but I'd always end up rambling around. 

I told myself that if I only brought $20 with me to the bar, I'd have to go home after that, but I'd end up mooching off of the poor schmucks sitting around me.

I told myself that if I only stayed out until 11pm, that I'd be okay to work the next day, but I'd end up at some after bar party and showing up to work still half-drunk.

I never even attempted to control the pot.

It turned out that the only drink that I have ANY control over is the first one. Good intentions and plans and promises all go right in the gutter as soon as that alcohol hits my blood stream. One day I got a nudge from a judge, that had me go get an AODA assessment. Turns out I'm an alcoholic/addict! Honestly, if it hadn't been for that, I don't know if I'd have quit. With my family all using alcohol to cope, and my friends all being users as well, I didn't even know that there was another way! So I stopped trying to fight it, and I (eventually) came to my senses. I did intensive outpatient treatment. I stopped going to bars altogether. I started going to meetings. I made friends with other people who were clean and sober. It was really hard, at first, actually. But the more I learned about myself, the longer I stayed clean and sober, the easier it got. 

The takeaway messages that I have for you, if you're struggling, are to (a) avoid eye-contact with neon; nothing good happens where there are neon signs! and (b) go to sober meetings and events! (Online, for the moment, probably.) Make friends who have the lifestyle that you want! Ask for help from people who inspire you! And (c) don't let God get in your way. If you're a spiritual/religious person, great. No problem for you! But if you're like me, and the word Jesus leaves a nasty taste in your mouth, then suck it up. Not everybody in the programs is godly. Use ""Good Orderly Direction"" as a placeholder/acronym for god. You don't have to participate in the prayers. If you're not comfortable with a certain meeting, try another one. You can work around the god shit. They tell you to ""take what you need, and leave the rest."" If you live in a more populous area, you might could find a SMART recovery meeting. No god there! I hate all those regurgitated platitudes, too, but the programs actually do work if you work them. 

Stay safe, Friends!",122
