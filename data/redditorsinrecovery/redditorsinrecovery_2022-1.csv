The ""right"" time will never come, waiting to feel better or feel ""right"" is a battle you won't win. You'll negotiate with yourself for a better opportunity or timing to quit, which won't come just more negotiations.

The only thing you can do is take action, which will change the mood. This means, you feel bad and decide to not run until you feel better vs. going out to run feeling like shit and then feeling better because the mood changed following the action of running. This is neuroscience.

""Persistance without insight is futile"", attempting to get different results without understanding what you're doing wrong is pointless. First, realize now the next time you negotiate with yourself it's a lost battle so don't even attempt that fight. And next time you feel bad, don't wait to feel better but rather do the action and then mood will change. Hope this helps!",10

It took me a while to open up and tell my story and my burden. I hope you can make me see things clearer...

My hell started a year ago, when in the stupid drunkness that I regret to this day and I don't deny or try to give the blame on alcohol (all the blame is mine), I made a mistake that legally qualified as sexual assault. It is not something that I'm proud of and I paid a lot for it (panic attacks that would last for hours, being continuously scared and ashamed by my own person, a lot of money to get my situation legally clean (currently I have no legal issues, I'm clear as a normal person on this regard), I could clear my name because it was not something serious (I could end the situation peacefully because it wasn't something like attacking someone or groping or idk other stuff like this, but I don't like sharing other details on this matter). But people started talking that I tried to rape or went naked to attack someone, and a lot of other stuff that one year later would come back again)

In time I could manage to start living with my fault and started to move on (not completely), all ""fine"" until this autumn: because I didn't get a place at my university dorm I decided to take the place of another student  (a common practice in my country), all well until the guard recognized me and quickly went to the dorm administrator to kick me out, the thing that happened during the same day.

They accused me of voyeurism and were sure that I was, not wanting to hear any of my defences. My panic attacks kicked in again, and the next days I was contacted that I have to go to the police (the moment when my panic reached the peak and I would continuously tremble), my first thought was that all the hell is coming back and she went to police to falsely accuse me of something I didn't do. I was not worried regarding the ending because I didn't do anything of what she accused me of, but because I would have to go again through the same hellish moments I lived one year before: arrest, being accused, my honour being thrown in the mud again).

As a coincidence of faith or something, the police only wanted to contact me regarding that case being ended and stuff related to that. But until I discovered that I was sooooo low with my psyche, during this time my former roommate started spreading the rumour about me that I was doing voyeurism and everyone started a witch hunt and mob mentality against me, wanting to hurt me, starting to laugh on me, wanting to publicly shame me. When I discovered I reached a low that I never had in my life, I could no longer think, no longer feel safe, being scared to sleep or to do anything. I didn't know what to do, I started blocking people, closing my social media (I only wanted was to be left alone).

Eventually, the things chilled out (I think) nothing happened, except for the unfriends and blocks I received, but from that moment on I could not stop being scared and angry at the same time, angry that I was wrongfully accused I didn't know what to do and how to defend myself. Scared because of everything that is me, my name, my identity, my future, recently someone from that group of people recognized me on social media after we got into an argument and she tried to gather all the group to bash me somehow.

I know at this point I have to go to therapy, but I don't yet have money for this. I'm scared that this will hunt me all my life, that my future will eventually meet people that would think I'm a rapist or other stuff, that I would crack and lose myself again. I really don't know how to manage this and I would really ask for your sincere help on this matter, it went out of my hand a long time ago...

I tried to learn from the mistake I made, changed my life, everyone that knew me said that I became more organized and less chaotic or toxic. I really really tried to work on improving myself and eventually to repair my image and get my life in order. It's really fuking hard when you have continuous panic attacks and other shits happening around you at the same time.

I really want to move on, to stop being scared of what could or not happen to me, to fight somehow all the people that throw shit at me, it's hard...

Thank you for your time and all the hate or support that you will give to me.",6

Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôve been focusing on sobriety since September 2021, and although I‚Äôve been successful at staying sober besides a small slip over the holidays, my life is falling apart worse than whenever I was a drunk.

The reason for my life falling apart is fatigue. And I don‚Äôt mean tired. What I mean by fatigue is my muscles don‚Äôt engage so they‚Äôre weak and floppy, I can‚Äôt sit upright most of the time, or stand without holding onto something, I have energy to shower, or even to breath, move, or eat some days. The fatigue started slowly, and became more intense as time went on to the point that I decided the only way out is suicide.

By the way, labs are all normal and I don‚Äôt have Covid, so no explanation for the extreme, debilitating fatigue. I had also been super active in the summer, swimming almost every day, eating healthy and taking all my supplements, despite drinking regularly.

I decided instead of killing myself because of the fatigue that has robbed me of my whole life, that I would drink. I started drinking and didn‚Äôt stop, and now I can live with the fatigue and even have a tiny bit of energy from the alcohol. So no regrets over the relapse, just wish there was another way for me to live, and hopefully someday I find it.",10

2022-01-23 01:30:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/san6qi/stuck_on_the_fence_about_treatment/,Stuck on the fence about treatment,"So I‚Äôve been trying to get into a treatment centre for months now. Due to having to rely on government funds, I don‚Äôt have many choices when it comes to where I go for treatment. The first one recommended to me that accepted my intake form right away is an all women‚Äôs centre located a ferry ride and a three hour drive from my house. So basically I‚Äôd be ‚Äúon my own‚Äù (away from family) for all 90 days. So after calling in every night for 85 days (I‚Äôve been counting) to keep my application going until a bed was available‚Ä¶they called.

Before I go on, I should mention what I‚Äôm taking. I‚Äôm seeking help for over the counter cough medicine. DXM abuse. On the side, I‚Äôm stuck in a loop with Lorazepam. I‚Äôve been taking it years for panic attacks and now I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs actually causing more anxiety than helping with it.

I also have IBS and take small amounts of codeine to stop the diarrhea. This is prescribed and is really stuck being my only option until they invent some better medication. 

The treatment centre is based on pure abstinence from all drugs. This includes the prescribed codeine since it‚Äôs an opiate. If I go there, they will require me to give up the codeine. This is terrifying for the obvious reason of just spending the day on the toilet and being in stomach cramp agony. They said I could wean off it and go on Suboxone‚Ä¶which I don‚Äôt want to do. It won‚Äôt stop the IBS symptoms and will just add another substance to my body. I want help though. I need help.  

I got the call from the centre about a start date for treatment a couple days ago. I either go this coming up Wednesday or basically never. I feel just like my life is now not in my hands. 

I‚Äôm also on Venlafaxine. 

I‚Äôm going to die without help or end up in the psych ward. The DXM is taking a toll on my body and my mind. I am fully aware of this. None of this is fun anymore. I want off this train but I can‚Äôt just stop suddenly. Medically that will put me in a dangerous place. The cough medicine is alcohol based. My doctor agrees that my Lorazepam is basically holding back the alcohol withdrawal symptoms I may be having when I go without the cough medicine. I‚Äôve tried to skip days with the cough medicine since all the articles I‚Äôve read about DXM says you can‚Äôt get psychically addicted to it;that it‚Äôs all mental. So I try my best to ‚Äúgrab some balls‚Äù and tough it out without the cough syrup. It‚Äôs rough though and there‚Äôs some obvious mental stuff that comes with it. There‚Äôs reasons why I ended up taking it and I‚Äôm working on dealing with those issues. Anyways, my doctor and psychiatrist both said weaning off of it would be better than going cold turkey. This is where my problems lie. The centre will make me wean off of my lorazepam starting as soon as I arrive. So I‚Äôll be weaning off of the cough syrup with weaning off of the medication that will help with the cough syrup withdrawal. And I‚Äôll be suddenly off the codeine I‚Äôve been taking for years. I feel like I‚Äôm going to like have some serious issues with all this. Like seizures and mental meltdowns.

I didn‚Äôt mention that this place has no medical staff on site. A doctor pops by once a week. My intake will be the day after he pops by so I will have to wait a week just to see him for the first time. Am I right for being terrified about this? Just to give you an idea about how not medically taught the staff is‚Ä¶II mentioned my SSRI, Venlafaxine, the intake worker said ‚Äúoh is that like a puffer (inhaler). I‚Äôm supposed to put my trust and health in people that just don‚Äôt have the medical knowledge. 

I know some will see all this as me making excuses. My sister sure does. She said this is me trying to get out of getting off of drugs and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only thing stopping you from getting help‚Äù. That instantly made me feel so low. 

Here‚Äôs what I want to do: I am very very blessed to still live with my mum. We are best friends and she knows about my addiction. She wants me to go to treatment. But after sitting with me and having me tell her all this and saying that I‚Äôm just so scared, she listened to what I want to do‚Ä¶at least until I can get into another better suited treatment centre (my drug counsellor put in an application to a hospital based program. It seems so much safer for me. The wait list is long though‚Ä¶).

I want to go through with taking a leave from my job and just staying at home. I want to, with the help of my doctor, wean off the cough syrup. If all goes well, the weaning schedule will get my off it in like a month and a half. While getting off of it, I will stay on my lorazepam and codeine. After getting a hold on my cough syrup addiction, I will get off of the lorazepam. At 2mg a day, I know I can get off it with guidance. Maybe by then, a bed will open up somewhere.

I know being stuck at home can be bad for addictions but it‚Äôs a safe place for me. My cat is here. My arts and crafts, Lego kits and other things to safely amuse myself are. My mum is here.

So‚Ä¶what do you think? I‚Äôm honestly asking for outside views of this situation. I have until Monday to let the treatment centre know what I‚Äôm doing. Right now I‚Äôm so stuck on the fence.

I‚Äôm just so scared and stuck. I need help. I know I need help.",3

I stopped doing drugs for about three months cause I went to a residential psych place and then did IOP at a drug treatment center which I left cause I hated it.. I also started doing coke and meth again so that also was why I left. I don‚Äôt know exactly how I ended up with a prescription for concerta last year but I was taking it pretty decently and following the label for a couple months.. my doctor ended up getting pretty lax on taking drug tests too so I started to abuse it but only when I was coming off other drugs to make it less despressing.. this last week though (around Monday 1/10) I got a refill and just had done a bit of coke over the weekend so decided to keep that high going. And concerta sucks btw like it would just make me super anxious when I did more than prescribed and didn‚Äôt cause any euphoria but I couldn‚Äôt stop taking it and wanted to stay up I guess?? I don‚Äôt remember why I decided to blow through all my pills but from Monday- Friday I did all 30 pills and stayed up for that entire time.. I went a bit crazy cause I couldn‚Äôt sleep so called 911 and they told me to go to the hospital so they could help me so my mom drove me to the hospital where I proceeded to have a nervous breakdown and don‚Äôt remember much but I apparently hallucinated that a light was a dragon trying to kill me‚Ä¶ they gave me something to calm me down and help me sleep though and I‚Äôd wake up every once in a while cause this lady was trying to get more info from me and where ti send me after I left and she was talking about going to the place I hated or a different place was willing to fly me to Idaho ( I live in Washington) but I declined cause I didn‚Äôt think it was super necessary‚Ä¶ anyways now I regret not going and I feel ashamed and just super embarrassed and I bought more Ritalin cause I don‚Äôt want to do harder stuff but I also haven‚Äôt done it cause I really don‚Äôt want to keep doing this to myself and I think I‚Äôm just done‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never done that before and honestly scared myself.. now I‚Äôm just super depressed and wondering how or where I should try and find places to go to?

Hope you are well.

I just wanted to share something which has really helped me in PAWS, but I think this is a long term issue I have had, I had a test done for something called MTHFR mutation and it came back positive.

This basically effects your ability to fully convert folic acid to its active form (methyl folate).

I've started taking a b complex supplement and it has been like night and day, I have gone from napping all day and unable to even do any work to full of energy.

One thing which I found interesting from looking into this is that this mutation can affect how well you can create neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, then comes mood changes (depression and anxiety), addictive traits (drugs, alcohol and cigarettes).

The supplement you should try for this is one containing the methyl folate (B9) form, don't take folic acid, because you can't convert it well if you have this mutation (I've read about 30-40% of Americans have this mutation).

Obviously take this with a grain of salt and do your own research, I'm just a guy on the internet, but getting a test for MTHFR can't hurt, or you could just go straight to trying a supplement with the methylated form of B9 and see how you feel. If you want to know the supplement I am taking you can PM me, I don't want to break any rules.

I hope this helps someone who might be in the position I was in, all those years self medicating are now looking like it was me trying to counteract my own body's ability to give me energy and a healthy amount of neurotransmitters.

All the best,",21

I am glad to have found a recovery subreddit in general, as I also feel that this is another step in switching to a lifetime of sobriety. 

So, I first started to get sober successfully for the first time with the help of a sober living place in April. I had moved to Arizona while pregnant with my daughter & never relapsed until she was about 2 1/2-3 months. It was Halloween and due to triggers that I was unable/didn‚Äôt want to control. So the place I was living, they sent me to a ‚Äòmore strict‚Äô rehab. I sent the directors of my last home texts to hopefully help me pretty much as soon as I got here. However, they were not in charge of my case anymore. It was like I left somewhere with people with experience being sober & empathy, to somewhere cold and inexperienced. 

Time went by & it had never been lovely. I have been here for about 40-50 days now and not one day has been completely drama free since being here. I am here with my almost 5 month old daughter and basically at this point there are grown women, a group of about 6 or more, that are trying to make my life hell. They talk about only me in large groups without my name, the other day 5 of them getting up from the table screaming and walking up to my face trying to intimidate me after I was trying to ask them to stop making up rumors about me. There is one girl who screams bloody murder and calls her lawyer and Mom every time I get a privledge, like a cupcake snack out of my locker, because it‚Äôs ‚Äòracist‚Äô here that I didn‚Äôt get in trouble for asking them to stop and them chasing and yelling at me (she wasn‚Äôt even there) and she gets in trouble for ‚Äòeverything‚Äô, even though most of the staff and counselors are black women and I just got off ‚Äòaccountability‚Äô one week ago (hence, I do get in trouble like everyone else, but not for people chasing me and my daughter and screaming profanities at us).  

I am trying to maybe apply for somewhere else, but we are homeless at the moment & my counselors were asked by the staff at the other place I lived to help us find housing, which I believe they legitimately can help us (I didn‚Äôt mention that place asked for me not to come back after two weeks of being here; I was supposed to return after one month initially).

So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not eager to leave because I do have support from some staff and the counselors (who ultimately decide privledges and how you are progressing) and I‚Äôm doing well with my sobriety again. I also don‚Äôt want to introduce my baby girl with too much change all at once in the first months of her life. But she also doesn‚Äôt need to see me getting bullied and in heated arguments with people who are a bit off their hinges. 

Mostly posting to vent about everything & maybe gather other experiences but also say that I am glad to be on the right track again.


EDIT, PLEASE READ!: I have read each and every post, I am honestly so grateful and honestly a bit surprised (a good thing) at all the support, help, & explanation offered here. I wanted to thank each one of you individually, but since I am feeling like I, too, need to fix some of my habits of communication to not feel bullied by others I chose to respond like this! But please, please note that I read each and every response and to be honest each response left was both touching and helpful in all ways. There wasn‚Äôt one that felt like I didn‚Äôt understand or relate to or love what was said. And I thus just wanted to let you know how grateful I am & that I am also taking some of the methods mentioned very seriously. Thank you thank you thank you!",16

It‚Äôs helped me stay on the right path for years. The pharmacy has no reason to think I misuse it.

Every month when I try to fill my prescription, the pharmacy makes me jump through hoops. 

Typically, it‚Äôs outrageous wait times. I‚Äôm talking hours. I have no choice but to sit there and wait. Up to 4 hours in the past. 

Another thing they like to do is force me to get my doctor to call them before they‚Äôll fill it. They always do this on a weekend when there‚Äôs no doctor to call. I‚Äôve ended up going multiple days without my prescription because they claim the prescription is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.

They‚Äôve lied to my face about ‚Äúlaws‚Äù. I was once told I could not pay cash while I waited for my insurance approval. They didn‚Äôt allow me to purchase my own medication until I called another pharmacy and proved them wrong. Afterwards, they tried to tell me I‚Äôd need a new prescription from my doctor since they sold me a 2 day supply. My doctor confirmed this was false.

They refuse to give me my prescription even a day early. Even if it‚Äôs already paid for. Life happens, I can‚Äôt always get there on the exact date of the refill. They once made me sit there until midnight waiting for ‚Äúthe refill date‚Äù. It‚Äôs a 24 hour place. They‚Äôve even said I can fill it 2 days early. When I try, I get refused. That just happened today. Now I won‚Äôt be able to get it until Tuesday. I took my last pill this morning.

There‚Äôs other things but it‚Äôll take too long to type.

Is there anything I can do? I‚Äôm just tired of dealing with this every time I need my medication.

Edit: Can‚Äôt switch pharmacies. Nobody around here will order Zubsolv because it costs almost a thousand dollars a month to buy. 

A thousand dollars. For bupe and naloxone. Fucking despicable.

Oh, and please don‚Äôt say ‚Äújust stop using it‚Äù. It helps me tremendously and it‚Äôs my recovery, my choice. I don‚Äôt care if you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot really being clean‚Äù. It‚Äôs kept me from shooting heroin for 7 years. Which is far longer than many, many people.",23

2022-01-13 12:13:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/s34ckh/journaling_and_positivity/,Journaling and Positivity,"Journaling has been a great tool for me in my recovery. It keeps me on point with my thoughts / words / and actions daily. Just some thoughts below on what journaling means to me. 

 Stay positive. Being positive attracts good things to your life. Don't let negativity seep in. See the opportunity in every situation.

Okay, sounds easy enough, right? Well, as someone who has been practicing mindfulness, positivity, and meditation for decades, it's not. It's really not. But it's not impossible. And I want to talk about some ideas towards that positivity.

Power. Thoughts have power. We're taught that. Mind power is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. Your imagination is literally a factory for possibility. Use it correctly, and it can do you wonders. Our brains were literally evolutionary created to do this. To take our experiences and knowledge and use that to imagine our futures. So that we have something to go after. So, use your thoughts and your mind power for this, and just imagine how far you can go.

Words have power. Words cannot change reality, but they can change how people (including you) perceive the reality around them (and you). So, knowing this, would you use your words to purport positivity or negativity? That choice can change so many experiences, even your own. 

Actions have power. Actions shape our lives. Wow. Isn't that exciting? But it's daunting too. To change, thoughts and words are good, but action is needed. And that can be terrifying. But you know what's great about that? It doesn't always matter the SIZE of the action. But more the CONSISTENCY. So, you can totally change your life with small, buildable, consistent action. They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Okay, that's a small action, but one that can be done, and built upon. And research shows that taking small positive action, consistently, does make a person want to build upon them.

So, what do I do that incorporates all three of these ideas into daily positivity? I journal. CONSTANTLY. I journal in my thoughts, I use my voice to journal, and I take the action to examine my world on a daily basis through journaling. I see where I did think positively or negatively, and how it affected me. One little action, done daily, leading to such profound education to myself, and how I view the world. A buildable action that makes me want to go out and do more. Small, but profound. Positive brain training. With something as small as paper and pen. Beautiful, when you really think about it.

Namaste",7

I'm not saying AA is better than NA or the other way around, I guess it depends on the individual. I'd just like to share my recent experience. I'm currently two years clean. Although I used an enormous variety of drugs, my drug of choice was alcohol. I was in AA for two years and I was sober, without any cravings, which I consider a true miracle. I noticed though, that the rest of my life wasn't really progressing. Other people in AA shared that their lives were falling perfectly into places, getting new homes, landing new jobs, etc. I didn't have any of that and I felt other people were progressing way faster. I due to a change in a few factors, I regularly started attending NA meetings too. I did 2 NA meetings per week + 2 AA meetings. Then, I did find a new job, and I was able to focus on my college work way better. I noticed I stopped obsessing about romantic partners and I was actually able to keep my thoughts in the day, and not worry about tomorrow. I then figured NA must be the program for me and I've currently got an NA sponsor. A few days ago though, I realized I'm getting slightly irritable, fidgety, and that the palms of my hands are getting sweaty. I've had this in the past, during period when I wasn't doing much stepwork. I've been doing a lot of meetings and service though. But the I'm now starting to think that maybe I should have stayed in AA. NA seemed to improve my living standards a lot, but AA seemed to give me more peace of mind and perhaps a better guarantee of staying sober.  Or is this just all in my head?

I feel so out of place. I've had a few trial runs with sponsors but never found one I felt connected to/inspired by, except one but at the time I had no intention of staying clean and dropped her. 

I've tried SMART Recovery and really enjoyed it, but there's not many meetings in person and it just really sucks to feel this way about the oldest, most easily accessible and relied on program for addicts in existence. I just don't understand how you could gain any benefit from just sitting there and talking with no feedback.

*‚ÄúNarcotics Anonymous offers addicts a program  of recovery that is more than just a life without drugs.¬† Not only is  this way of life better than the hell we lived, it is better than any  life that we have ever known.‚Äù*

**Basic Text, p. 107**

Few of us have any interest in ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù  what we had before we started using.¬† Many of us suffered severely from  physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.¬† Getting high and staying high  seemed like the only possible way to cope with such abuse.¬† Others  suffered in less noticeable but equally painful ways before addiction  took hold.¬† We lacked direction and purpose.¬† We were spiritually  empty.¬† We felt isolated, unable to empathize with others.¬† We had none  of the things that give life its sense and value.¬† We took drugs in a  vain attempt to fill the emptiness inside ourselves.¬† Most of us  wouldn‚Äôt¬†*want*¬†to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù what we used to have.

Ultimately, the recovery we find in NA is  something different: a chance at a new life.¬† We‚Äôve been given tools to  clear the wreckage from our lives.¬† We‚Äôve been given support in  courageously setting forth on a new path.¬† And we‚Äôve been given the gift  of conscious contact with a Power greater than ourselves, providing us  with the inner strength and direction we so sorely lacked in the past.

Recovering?¬† Yes, in every way.¬† We‚Äôre  recovering a whole new life, better than anything we ever dreamed  possible.¬† We are grateful.

**Just for today:**¬† I‚Äôve recovered  something I never had, something I never imagined possible: the life of a  recovering addict.¬† Thank you, Higher Power, in more than words can  say.

I would love to hear some suggestions from others!,"I am currently 86 days sober. The longest amount ever in my life (28M). This time around, I went to detox (it didn‚Äôt help at all) but instead of going to sober living after detox, I instead went to rehab for 45 days. I had tried 3 separate times to pass over the rehab part and go straight from detox or cold Turkey to a sober living, but kept relapsing. Rehab has made a hug difference this time around. I also had an extremely supportive girlfriend that helped a ton and I know a lot of people do not have support from other family members or significant others but that helped me a lot.


Another reason I haven‚Äôt had a relapse is because of Subs. What a game changer. They don‚Äôt make me feel high whatsoever and they get rid of 80 percent of my cravings. That is way better than the naltrexone and Vivitrol shot I have tried before. 

With my cravings reduced significantly, I was able to focus my attention on ways to deal with triggers and cravings, and to notice relapses before they happen.

I graduated from the rehab and was accepted into their IOP program. I am use to making a lot of money in a stressful job, however, my sponsor suggested I get a low stress job for Atleast a year. Another game changer. I make just enough to live off of (I have a decent amount in savings that my parents held onto because I told them to or I would blow it on drugs). 

Here are ways that have helped me stay sober. I understand I don‚Äôt have that much sober time but in my opinion the first 2 weeks and then months 2-3 are the hardest part to get by without relapsing. These are suggestions and I hope this helps out someone who is struggling or just looking for advice:

1. Detox then go to rehab. Eventually move on to sober living for a minimum of 6 months to a year.

2. Obtain a sponsor and work the steps. This helped me a lot and I am not a big believer in god but I do believe in a higher power so that helped.

3. Get as many sober friends as you can and keep some of them as people you can call when you are thinking of relapsing. Same with sponsor. Call whenever you have cravings or are triggered.

4. Controversial, but subs saved my life. I know it won‚Äôt be easy to get off of them but I‚Äôm going to stay on them until my life is put back together (1-2 years. I was hoping for 6 months so we will see Where I am at at that point.)

5. If you can, extend your time in a safe facility by doing an IOP program for like a month.

These are all just suggestions and I guarantee I forgot a lot haha. I would love for people to comment with their suggestions as I am very early in this fight for my life and I will consider the suggestions you offer. Thanks so much for reading this. I love you all and let‚Äôs beat this disease!",15

I could never deal with my emotions sober. I could never work jobs, especially not ones that dealt with people. That really sucked because I majored in foreign languages but because I couldn't work under stress and deal with emotions, I could never keep a job. I was always in very toxic relationships and I would drink and use all the stress away. Two years ago, I was I a very abusive relationship (which I acknowledge, is a two way street so I'm not just blaming the guy). He dumped me twice and I hit rock bottom. I actually ended up in the drunk tank a few times. That's what got me sober though. I am a 'recovery child of the pandemic', meaning I spent most of my sobriety in my own house. Yet I feel more free than ever before. I've been working the steps since. I went back to college and I'm finishing two grad school degrees now. I also started working a new job recently. It's only been a month since I started working but I've only had positive feedback so far.  The job is actually very similar to what I used to have, but the difference is my attitude. Recently,  I was cut off by a guy I was seeing.  He blocked me everywhere and I haven't heard from him since, but I didn't relapse. I stayed clean through all of it.

I've been sober since February from h, meth and so grateful to be out of that life, drama and chaos. One of the most important reasons I made it out is my sponsor. I've know her for years and years. We were in the trenches together but she got setup, caught a case and did a few years in prison. When she got out I noticed she legit got her act together and I reached out. She helped me bounce back from living out of motels, robbing, stealing and selling drugs to a sober life. She was able to say things in a way to me no one else could because of how well she knew me. If it wasn't for her insight and advice I wouldn't be where I am today. A few weeks ago I went to visit her in person and spend the weekend. Our first in person visit in years. Our communication faded the past few months. There were some red flags I glazed over thinking it was my PTSD or hypersensitivity to people using and ruining their life. Anyhow, during my in person visit I accidentally discovered some thing, confronted her and she admitted to having started smoking tar again. She says she's worked through her trauma, she's healed and no longer and addict and legit uses heroin like a normal person. 
I've given up on having a conversation with her about it. She's so deluded and gets angry with me for just not being okay with her being ok using h. I refuse to co-sign her bullshit. It's baffling how someone so wise and experienced gets that stuff in them and ""poof"" they are living in some fantasy world.
She's adamant, however, that she's got no problems and is using heroin like a normal person. Does that even exist? I mean, she's so wise and such. I know she's smarter than that. I just don't get it. And the more I don't just be okay with it the more I get her mad at me. Idk, drugs are such poison. The one person in this world, my sponsor and BFF, whom I thought was immune to relapse, certainly from a long drawn out relapse has succumbed. It's so demoralizing and lonely.

Theres so much I could say as  a backstory I'm lost for words but time is running out I can't really deal with the heartache that would follow if the same pattern should follow suit for the 1000th time.

&#x200B;

The is gonna be disjointed/rushed but I could literally write a 1000page book of bullshit over the course of 10 years and no ones got time for that on here right. Theres so much I could say and add to this but this is all to do with a blowup that happened an hour ago and I just fear the worst again

&#x200B;

Anyways brief backstory, my sisters an recovering addict on crack (the nz version), shes tried probably 5 times in 2 years to get clean but the extent of her addiction is shes literally a glutton where she almost acts like has parkinsons on the shit.

&#x200B;

Anyways she has numerous health problems now and has mascular degeneration (shes only 30) and from the shit but hey despite having this it didn't stop her from relapsing again and anyways shes been back 6 weeks

&#x200B;

So far things have been good, while things are on her terms, I think she suffers from many things with NPD being one of them. It doesn;t matter how calm and tactfully I try to address things with her she always shuts the convo down before it even begins.

&#x200B;

If I try give her advice she shuts it down, if I try support her she shuts it down, if I query anything suspicious, she shuts it down, you get the drift.

&#x200B;

Not only that but she was relying on Lithium cause according to her she has Bipolar and thats no longer an option due to her blood levels or someshit,she had councelling who was ringing every day which hasnt happened since just before XMas

&#x200B;

Just the way she expects me to drop shit is always down to blind faith and that I trust her when literally no action is happening, apart from lazy ways out light sleep affirmations which shes done 3 times now and failed.

I moved to a new country and in doing so lost all of my support- no one to talk to, none of my psychiatric medications due to health insurance issues, and none of my safe and familiar routines I had built up to keep myself sober. I reached out for help on another sub (a couple times) and didn‚Äôt get any responses. The people in my new country don‚Äôt seem to understand sobriety. When I drank again, people outright said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good that you‚Äôre drinking!‚Äú It just felt so depressing that no one seemed to be able to accept me for the quiet, socially awkward, shy and weird person that I am. I have grown to accept that part of myself in sobriety and it really hurt to realize that my own self acceptance didn‚Äôt end up being enough for me. I know it‚Äôs normal to want to be accepted, to want to feel loved, to want friendships and connections, so I am trying not to blame myself for that. But I wish I had been strong enough to get through this without alcohol.

I blacked out 4 times in the span of 2 months all by accident. Two times I was out in the city trying to find my way home, and don‚Äôt remember my long bus rides or who I was with. I‚Äôm sure I was embarrassing. Makes me feel ill to think about because I thought this was all behind me. I wanted to come into this new place as the confident, sober person I had worked to become- with no bad memories in a new city- and lost that possibility to my reaction towards mental illness and fear and loneliness. How do I forgive myself for being human?

I did amphetamine about eight times, E once, bought a total of fifteen benzos (alp), tried opioids three times and very occasionally smoked pot. 

But I have withdrawals despite essentially just dipping my toes into it all. I hate being sober. I‚Äôm emotionally flat, except for the occasional bout of anger. I feel good when I‚Äôm high, emotionally and just about myself in general. 

I have things that force me to stay clean. My relationship will end if my boyfriend finds out I‚Äôm using, even though I did opioids less than two weeks before our one year anniversary. I have a puppy now, who‚Äôs so expensive and will only cost more once I live on my own and have to pay all of his expenses. 

Physically I don‚Äôt need to get high. But in my head, I just want to feel good again. I want to look at my body and feel good about how it looks, and a crutch to help me get through school, and a tool to make people like me more. 

I was high on amp on campus once and someone I barely know said he liked me better the way I was then, because it made me quiet. 

Ecstasy made me so content that I still think about the one time I did it and cry. I laid in the grass with a friend, we held hands and listened to piano man while looking at the clouds. I was so happy back then, I wish I could feel like that again. At the rate I‚Äôm going now though, that‚Äôs never going to happen.

(and he did). so fast forward to this morning, he‚Äôs asleep in our bed and i got up to look for something and i went into his coat pocket and found a meth pipe. i‚Äôve never seen one in person but i knew immediately what it was. turns out he has been using it at the next door neighbor‚Äôs house while i‚Äôm asleep at night. he‚Äôs also gotten it from people at work and his friends. he told me that it‚Äôs not an issue and he could ‚Äúput it down today and never touch it again‚Äù but im not stupid enough to believe that. if he could do that, he would‚Äôve never done it. or at the very least never done it more than once. he feels ashamed and guilty, and i feel bad for being angry even though my anger is justified. the last thing i want to do is make him feel awful. i know that addiction is a disease and that just because you use drugs doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. i know his heart and i know in my bones that he‚Äôs a wonderful man. but i am torn. i have never been in a situation like this and i also feel deceived and like he took the choices away from me that i should‚Äôve been able to make myself. he said he wasn‚Äôt going to tell me about the meth until after he had been clean for a while but that‚Äôs not fair. i have a 3 year old son and i‚Äôm pregnant with our baby and im angry that he kept this from me because it could seriously damage my kids. im appalled at the selfishness but im not surprised. i know people on drugs do things that aren‚Äôt like them. i don‚Äôt know how to walk the thin line between being compassionate, trying to help him and holding him accountable for what he‚Äôs done. the biggest thing im upset about is my children. if he had screwed up and got caught up, i could‚Äôve gotten my son taken from me. he‚Äôs also taken my son over to the neighbor‚Äôs house without me before. knowing that they do meth and that he‚Äôs done it with them. idk what to do. i love him and want to help him through recovery if he‚Äôs willing to put in the work but the last thing i want to do is put my children in a compromising situation. please give me advice, anything. please. i am so lost.",3
