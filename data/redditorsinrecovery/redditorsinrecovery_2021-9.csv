**Basic Text, p. 99**

&#x200B;

“Just for today”—it’s a comforting thought.  If  we try to live in the past, we may find ourselves torn by painful,  disquieting memories.  The lessons of our using are not the teachers we  seek for recovery.  Living in tomorrow means moving in with fear.  We  cannot see the shape of the secret future, and uncertainty brings  worry.  Our lives look overwhelming when we lose the focus of today.

Living in the moment offers freedom.  In this  moment, we know that we are safe.  We are not using, and we have  everything we need.  What’s more, life is happening in the here and  now.  The past is gone and the future has yet to arrive; our worrying  won’t change any of it.  Today, we can enjoy our recovery, this very  minute.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will stay in the here and now.  Today—this moment—I am free.

**Basic Text, p. 95**

&#x200B;

As using addicts, despair was our relentless  companion.  It colored our every waking moment.  Despair was born of  our experience in active addiction:  No matter what measures we tried to  make our lives better, we slid ever deeper into misery.  Attempts we  made to control our lives frequently met with failure.  In a sense, our  First Step admission of powerlessness was an acknowledgment of despair.

Steps Two and Three lead us gradually out of  that despair and into new hope, the companion of the recovering  addict.  Having accepted that so many of our efforts to change have  failed, we come to believe that there is a Power greater than  ourselves.  We believe this Power can—and will—help us.  We practice the  Second and Third Steps as an affirmation of our hope for a better life,  turning to this Power for guidance.  As we come to rely more and more  on a Higher Power for the management of our day-to-day life, the despair  arising from our long experiment with self-sufficiency disappears.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will reaffirm my Third Step decision.  I know that, with a Higher Power in my life, there is hope.

Hey guys I am looking into finally stopping use by going back to detox/rehab. 

I wanted to get some advice from y’all. I have been using straight fent for the last 3 years. Anywhere from 1.5-3 grams a day. I make really good money and it’s just fueled my tolerance getting ridiculous. I remember when I first relapsed an amount a quarter the size of my pinky nail had me od’d on the bathroom floor. I’m using the same stuff and now doing quarter to half gram shots of it at a time unphased. 

The biggest thing I’m afraid of in detoxing is precip withdrawal. I know the standard protocol at most rehabs is bupe and I have tried over 5 different times ranging from 24-60 hours before inducing only to be thrown into precipitated withdrawal every time. I don’t want to go through that hell ever again. 

My question is, have any of y’all gone to a rehab or know of one that will do a methadone taper instead of bupe given the circumstance of the fentalogue I’m using causing precipitated withdrawal even after long abstinence(in full withdrawal; scoring with COWs worksheet)?

Any info is super appreciated. Thanks",12

Im not saying this to throw jabs at any one, I’m saying it because it’s a goddamn miracle I made it this far. A whole entire week without using a needle, after doing so multiple times a day for 4 years. I haven’t had a week without shooting in all that time. I’m not “clean” per se, not in the eyes of NA anyways (or myself for that matter) but eliminating the needle was always my first step. Now I’m here and I still don’t have the courage to go to a meeting like I thought I would. I guess it’s a little bit of self isolation mixed with a fear of failure and a dash of guilt and anxiety around exposing my truth. It is going to be hard to believe but besides wearing long sleeves all the time, I had a lot of people convinced that I’ve been clean. For the past 2 years anyways, since my son was born. I’m afraid of the judgment that will follow once they realize, and once I own the fact that I’ve been using around my son for longer than I care to admit. So disgusting. Shameful. Everything I thought I wouldn’t be, but here I am. I don’t know how to come to terms with the fact that if I want to stay clean, I’ve got to get honest. Good news is, it’s probably nothing they haven’t done themselves, bad news is, we addicts are human too- prone to judging and gossiping and belittling. My mom has 6 years clean in NA so to everyone in the rooms I’m just “Brittany G’s daughter” or whatever, that’s how it was even when I racked up clean time before my relapse, I’m nervous of how that will turn out. Also, suboxone is my current DOC and I believe I’ll go the tapering route so technically I’m not even allowed to speak in a meeting until I haven’t used any mind or mood altering substances. That’s what I’ve shot for 4 years if you’re wondering- crazy, I know, haven’t touched anything I actually “like” (xans, Roxys, opanas, etc) in FOUR years but still managed to mainline everyday and smoke a little bit of weed. Definitely a bad case of needle fixation, I’m for sure an addict. I think this is more of a diary entry than anything else so if you’ve made it this far, thanks for listening ❤️ Leave some kind words or advice if you have it to give. I appreciate you.",22

**Basic Text, p. 80**

&#x200B;

“Poor me; woe is me; look at me, my life is  such a mess!  I’ve fallen, and no matter how hard I try, I continue to  fail.”  Many of us came to NA singing this sad refrain.

Life isn’t like that anymore.  True, sometimes  we still stumble; at times we even fall.  Sometimes we feel like we  can’t move forward in our lives, no matter how hard we try.  But the  truth of the matter is that, with the help of other recovering addicts  in NA, we find a hand to pull us up, dust us off, and help us start all  over again.  That’s the new refrain in our lives today.

No longer do we say, “I’m a failure and I’m  going nowhere.”  Usually, it’s more like, “Rats!  I hit that same bump  in the road of life again.  Pretty soon I’ll learn to slow down or avoid  it entirely.”  Until then, we may continue to fall down occasionally,  but we’ve learned that there’s always a helping hand to set us on our  feet again.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  If I begin to cry failure, I’ll remember there is a way to move forward.  I will accept the encouragement and support of NA.

Since mid 202, I have explored the world of illicit drugs with both intense passion and fascination, so I have been a polysubstance user for about 18 months. I got into crystal meth during the final 6 months of my drug ""career"". I used daily for 4 months and have came to the conclusion that things would only worsen. I did not like the way I was behaving whilst under the influence, so I have made the decision to seek professional help on my own. I am currently  in rehab and will be entering into Intensive Outpatient Program for about 4 months. After that I will be returning to my city to resume life with my family as I knew it. Hopefully by then I will be stable enough to live without drugs but if I feel I am not then I will relocate completely. I am learning tio put my recovery first..Yes I still want to use here and there but I have Faith the cravings will dispate and thin out completely. I wnt to live life again, life on my terms rather than that of illicit drugs. I plan on getting really fit, starting college, learning to drive, and getting back into my hobby of language learning. All of this faded away and disipated completely during my years of drug use.

2021-09-25 15:11:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/pvdg84/my_20yo_nephew/,My 20yo nephew.,"Sorry. Here's a long winded story. 

My nephew (L) and I have always been close. Closer than his dad, closer than his mom. I've basically been as much of a dad to him as I could be as a single 20-30yo man. He had a shitty middle class upbringing. His dad (my brother) and his mom split when he was an infant as she ran away with my brother and my childhood best friend when I was 19 and 2,000 miles away for ""school."" Some real Jerry Springer shit. My brother is a gambling addict. He's lost two marriages and hundreds of thousands of dollars and is one year clean now and with a new supportive great gf, but this isn't about him. 

My nephew was ostracized at every opportunity at his mom's house, she had three more children after my nephew and had one previous child (5 total) who was adopted by her new husband. L was the one who wasn't ""his"" and they surely let him know and feel that way. L's always been a sweet boy, with some ADHD and wildness in his early youth. His mother and father did not co-parent together at all. There was so much selfish resentment between the two of them that they couldn't get past for L's betterment and well-being that is something I'll never forgive my brother for. 

When L was in middle school he started getting into trouble, not great grades, smoking weed, etc. And then when he got into high school he got into more of the same trouble. He finally went to live with my brother when he was 14/15. He was dropped off by his mom in 2015 and she hasn't tried to make contact with him since, NOT ONE FUCKING TIME. Posting on Facebook with her four other children like nothing was the matter, completely abandoning and forgetting about him. I can't even imagine the place in hell for someone like that. 

He got no help after moving in with with his dad and his step mom. Surprise!! Just hoping that ""love will pave the way"" didn't help at all. And the trouble kept escalating. Fights, expulsions, more weed, stealing pills and thousands of dollars from step mom's mother who lived with them. He was kicked out to my parent's house to protect his youngest siblings (much younger brother and sister to his dad and step mom) as the ultimatum was given to my brother. 

Again, he received no help. My parents were in their late 60s at the time, still working full time and in no condition to deal with a troubled teenager. So I moved in with them to try and help just be able to coexist. As anyone would imagine, the trouble just escalated. Admittedly, my head was in the sand with his troubles, expecting he will find his path. Not excusing myself, but I am a single late thirties man with no children (intentionally) I wasn't equipped or prepared to deal with a troubled 16/17 year old myself.

To the addiction.......in 2019, he started coming home from hanging out with friends really fucked up. It was acknowledged that he smoked weed, but this was different. Slurred speech, disgusting foamy(?) lips, wobbly walking, it wasn't weed. I got a text one day from his gf that he was abusing Xanax and fucking with guns and he denied it when confronted. (I realize now I'm missing so much of his story, but these are all the relevant parts I think) I had one of by best friends come to town in January of 2020 who stayed with us that L was familiar and friendly with. We went to go get pho one night and L was so fucked up he dropped his phone in his soup and was exhibiting such weird behavior at the restaurant (going to refill his own drink, just standing up and hovering around tables) that we just had to leave. When we got home he wanted to go smoke weed with his friend and I told him no, go to your room and just stay there. His room was on the second story. About twenty minutes after telling him to stay in his room, it was too eerily quiet, so I went to check on him and he was nowhere to be found. As you can imagine he jumped out of the window (about twenty feet up) fucked up out of his mind, standing on a rusty pipe while hanging out of the window. He literally could have died as there is nothing but concrete where he landed on his feet. He came knocking on the door about ten minutes later with both feet hurting but somehow avoiding being seriously injured. This was when I determined this couldn't go on any longer and if he wanted to continue living there he would have to get clean and do things my way. 

He was going to meetings and meeting with a therapist. I put a parent monitoring app on his phone that blocked Snapchat and monitored messages. Then the pandemic hit. The therapy center was closed down, and they stopped doing meetings, but he still stayed clean. 

This is a kid who was never pushed to do anything, no sports, no clubs, no music, nothing. He also had no hobbies besides video games, rap music and weed. 

I've been a poker player (mostly online) for the last 13 years. I've never had addiction problems aside from weed, but have usually been able to take breaks whenever I have needed to. I have tried about every drug possible aside from meth and heroin and I guess dare worked on me cause every time I did coke I was afraid my heart would explode. One of the things that makes me think I don't have the same problems other addicts do is I took aderall for work for a period of time and loved the feeling.....too much. The way it made my brain feel and tingle, the feeling of euphoria...it was too good. I stopped immediately. I know addicts don't have that privilege that I do of noticing it and being cognizant of that problem. I try not to judge addicts. I know it is a disease. My best friend (my brother) caused and deals with so much pain from it, I know it's not an addict's fault. It's only your fault when you don't seek help once you recognize it's a problem. 

Anyway, during the pandemic we were all locked inside and he needed something. So he wanted to try poker. And he liked it. He didn't know the game at all at first, and really struggled. But he kept with it and we were so proud of him. He was clean, he had something to be proud of. It was exciting. Then my dad caught the virus in July 20. He fought hard. Was intubated, got off intubation, but didn't make it. The patriarch of the family was gone and our family suffered a devastation we may never recover from. Through all this L stayed clean. In some ways I'm grateful for the pandemic as L had to be inside and learned a new skill, but I also despise everything about it as it took my dad, my hero, my anchor. 

We had to move from the apartment as my mom and dad lived on the property they worked for. So I moved my mom and L out with me to a new house. L thrived at poker during late 20/early 21. Doing things unexpected and taking himself to a different level. There were still personality quirks, ADHD problems, laziness, etc. But not when it came to poker. He loved it and was getting good. He built up a nice portion of money, and although he never understood the value of a dollar, he was decent with his management of it, albeit not going anywhere really to use it. 

After I got fully vaccinated in July, L wanted to go see an old friend he had from before he started using any drugs at all. I was reluctant, but I know I can't keep him in the house forever. He went and spent the night and came home, no big problem. The monitoring app on his phone included a screen lock that only I knew the password to, but he needed it when he was out or else his phone would be useless. So I gave it to him. We got into a random text argument and he deleted the app from his phone out of frustration, but I didn't think much about it because the trust he lost was fully back. He was clean, had a career and money, something I would think he would really have pride in and value. 


 About two weeks later he told me the kid was having a hotel party and asked if he could go. I trusted him again, and allowed it. 

He came home and gave both my mother and myself breakthrough cases of covid as he was unvaccinated. We all recovered, but he maintained a ""sinus infection"" that lasted weeks. About a month after that in late August around 4 pm I thought it was curious he hadn't come out of his room yet that day (he's a poor sleeper and it isn't terribly unusual) but just thought I would see what's up. He was gone. He left his phone behind and I went through it. In his messages were messages about coke, etc. I confronted him when he finally strolled in about 4 hours later and he admitted he had got coke for that one night at the hotel party and got it every night since. His whole bankroll was gone (about 20k) he had been on a 6 week binge right under my nose and again my head was too far in the sand to even realize. There were signs, I should have known. I feel so dumb, but it's not about me. Again, I immediately put the monitoring app back on his phone, along with another keylogging app that tracks what he does. There have been screaming matches and fights and it feels like January '20 all over again. My anxiety through the roof, being unable to eat or sleep, endless pacing. I just love him so much and want him to have a normal healthy productive life and I know he's so damaged from his past he may not want that for himself.

He has seen a psychiatrist who prescribed him ability and buspar, but he's so anti medicine (so frustrating) I know it's gonna be nearly impossible for him to get through the first couple of weeks of limited results and early side effects. 


Which takes us to today. I know he is still finding ways to do coke, he just did last night. I confronted him and he lied at first and I just told him when you want to be mature and honest, I'm here. As I was writing this, he came in my room any apologized for lying and said he had a problem and he really was committed to quitting.  But I don't know if that's honesty or manipulating. I'm kind of stuck. He's also so anti rehab from reading anecdotes on the stupid fucking /cocaine sub. 

Can't imagine anyone reading this whole thing. Thank you if you do. Just kind of stuck, not knowing the next step and this is really cathartic to write this all out. 

Tldr: 20yo nephew, recovering Xanax addict and current coke addict has relapsed and I'm not sure the next step to take.

**Basic Text, p. 30**

&#x200B;

A common complaint about the Fourth Step is  that it makes us painfully conscious of our defects of character.  We  may be tempted to falter in our program of recovery.  Through surrender  and acceptance, we can find the resources we need to keep working the  steps.

It’s not the awareness of our defects that  causes the most agony—it’s the defects themselves.  When we were using,  all we felt was the drugs; we could ignore the suffering our defects  were causing us.  Now that the drugs are gone, we feel that pain.   Refusing to acknowledge the source of our anguish doesn’t make it go  away; denial *protects* the pain and makes it stronger.  The  Twelve Steps help us deal with the misery caused by our defects by  dealing directly with the defects themselves.

If we hurt from the pain of our defects, we can  remind ourselves of the nightmare of addiction, a nightmare from which  we’ve now awakened.  We can recall the hope for release the Second Step  gave us.  We can again turn our will and our lives over, through the  Third Step, to the care of the God of our understanding.  Our Higher  Power cares for us by giving us the help we need to work the rest of the  Twelve Steps.  We don’t have to fear our feelings.  Just for today, we  can continue in our recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I won’t be afraid of my feelings.  With the help of my Higher Power, I’ll continue in my recovery.

She has always been there for me, stepped in when my dad wasn’t there for me, helped me emotionally or financially (with boundaries), but she just WILL NOT accept that I had an addiction issue. I hid it extremely well from her. There was once she found a little dime baggie when she was grabbing something from my old room, but just gave me “the mom look”.

I’ve been sober for 55 days, so this is all very recent.

I told her I need to stop drinking: she said well, maybe it’s not that big of a problem? You could just have one?

I told her my doctor will not prescribe me ADHD medication (yet) because of my past addictions: she said well maybe the doctor could start you on a really low dose?

I told her I need support not solutions: she doesn’t know how to just support, just wants to “fix”.

It’s frustrating. I have my boundaries, I see a therapist, this has come up in decently casual conversation because I’m becoming more open about it. The thing is though, she as an addict too. A long long long time ago, but I thought she would have some more “you can do it!” Or “it’s a journey” kind of support. 

I think I’m at the point where I need to leave her out of my recovery ups and downs. Or shutting the conversation down.

Last time I was on the phone with her I had to repeat 3 times… mom I was an addict that option is not available for me, talking about managing my ADHD.

It’s tough, she’s my only family member in this state, and she’s been so supportive before. But when I plainly say, “IM AN ADDICT” she shuts down or scatters for a solution.

This is mostly a vent post… advice is welcome.",22

**Basic Text, p. 24**

&#x200B;

In a lifelong process of coming to believe, our  understanding of God will change.  The understanding we have when new  in recovery will not be the same when we have a few months clean, nor  will that understanding be the same when we have a few years clean.

Our initial understanding of a Power greater  than ourselves will most likely be limited.  That Power will keep us  clean but, we may think, nothing more.  We may hesitate to pray because  we have placed conditions on what we will ask our Higher Power to do for  us.  “Oh, this stuff is *so* awful, even God couldn’t do anything,” we might say, or “God’s got a lot of people to take care of.  There’s no time for me.”

But, as we grow in recovery, so will our  understanding.  We’ll begin to see that the only limits to God’s love  and grace are those we impose by refusing to step out of the way.  The  loving God we come to believe in is infinite, and the power and love we  find in our belief is shared by nearly every recovering addict around  the world.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  The God I am coming to  understand has a limitless capacity for love and care.  I will trust  that my God is bigger than any problem I may have.

It has been a damn long road and I was never sure I would make it this far. 

I got drunk the first time when I was 11, smoked up when I was 16, and started shooting meth when I was 18, and finally got sober when I was 40. Meth was my drug of choice for most of those years, but I went through a coke phase, and a heroin phase, and I was always willing to do whatever substance was put in front of me. Jails, institutions, and death, I found all of em at one point or another. I have been beaten, stabbed, and poisoned. I slept on the streets and ate out of garbage cans, spent six weeks in bed with hep b and c, and went to jail more times than I can remember. I never gave a shit what happened to me or those around me as long as I could get my fix. I can tell you what it was like, what happened, and what it’s like now, but I don’t think I could ever convey how miserable, lonely, angry, and sad I was. As bad as the world I put myself in, it was nothing compared to how horrible my inner world was. That’s what drove my addictive behavior, not the world around me, but the world within.   My story isn’t really unique, many of you have been through the same, or worse. So I’m not gonna spend time telling war stories. I just wanted ya’ll to get some context. 

In 2005, it was all coming to a head, again. My ex-wife had moved 2000 miles away, with our daughter and neither one of them wanted anything to do with me. The only person in the family who would talk to me was my mom. My only ‘friends’ were other junkies, and eviction and life on the streets, again, was looming. Then in the space of 3 days I lost 2 friends, one left my house, went home and did her last shot, she was only 20. the other was screwing around with a pistol while high and shot himself, in front of me. I was broken, physically, mentally, and spiritually. Over the next month I tried to kill myself several times, but I always woke up. I remember thinking “you dumbass you cant even kill yourself.” I felt like the last kid on the playground and I just wanted to go home. Even today I sometimes have those feelings, but those days were some of the darkest in my life.  I checked into a psych ward and then 24 hours later conned my way out. I came to the realization that I couldn’t use anymore, and as I couldn’t seem to successfully off myself, I was gonna have to get sober. But not only did I have no real clue how to get sober, I had no idea how to live once I did. over the years of my addiction I had been to rehab twice. Neither one took, because I didn’t want to do the work. The state of texas put me in a long term rehab that had severe consequences if I used and that did manage to work for a while, but only because I didn’t want to go to prison. But fear only works for so long before you’re like, fuck it. So I was pretty sure nothing would work. 
	
Several months earlier the Alano club had moved in 3 doors down from my house so when the withdrawls eased up I went to a meeting. It was nice, scary, but nice. After I’d gone to a couple meetings I picked a sponsor. I chose someone who I thought, in a pinch, could kick my ass. It was my primary criteria, lol. See I knew I was an asshole and prone to violence so I figured if my sponsor could kick my ass maybe it would force me to behave. I guess it worked. We have come really close to blows once or twice over the years, and he even fired me when I wouldn’t do my forth step (I came crawling back and did the damn step). But we are still friends and he is still my sponsor. So maybe wasted me did something right. My sponsor has a simple plan: read the book and do what it says, go to meetings, work the steps, call your sponsor, do some service work, and don’t fucking use or drink today. We’ll worry about tomorrow when it get here.  I know AA isn’t for everyone, and some folks think it’s hokum, but god damn if it hasn’t worked for me. 

Let me tell you a little bit about my program. I have always been a mostly athiest, still am. But I figured that if praying could keep my sponsor sober why not give it a try. I didn’t have to believe in god to know that talking out loud about my problems could help to overcome or at least come to terms with them, after all shared pain is lessened pain, right? So my first several years I went to a lot of meetings where I tried (not always successfully) to keep my mouth shut and my ears open, read a lot of AA literature (not just the big book), prayed, met with my sponsor regularly, and worked the steeps. all my other efforts at life had failed, and I really had nothing left to lose.  I also got myself into therapy, and tried to really understand why I was an addict. The conclusion I came to was that I was just wired that way. I can get addicted to anything, booze and dope, sure, but other things too.  gambling, hell ya, it gave me a little bit of that same rush. sugar, yep. Binge eating, yep I can do that too. How about starving myself to lose all that binge weight, oh ya.  all this shit came up when I got sober and I had to find a way to get through it. The way my sponsor put it was “When you get here you’re a drunken horse thief, then you get sober.” So getting sober was only the first part of the solution for me. The rest of it was therapy, and learning to pay attention to what was going on in my head, without getting obsessed with it. I’m not there yet but I’m closer than I was. 

I have done more with my life since I got sober than I did in the previous 40 years. Got and kept a good job. Something I never was able to do while using. Hell I even upgraded to a better job a few years ago. I may even get to retire one day! I got a degree, I earned a black belt, lost a shit ton of weight, raised my daughter for 11 years. And I’ve stopped punching people when they piss me off.
 
Sobriety hadn’t been all good stuff though. A lot of the people that I knew back in the day are dead or in prison. I lost my daughter to an overdose in 2018, and in june of this year my girlfriend also died of an overdose. Staying sober for me means I have to handle that shit without getting loaded or just giving up and killing myself. But I’m not going to fucking use again, not today anyway. 
	I hope this isn’t too much of a rambling mess, and that somebody finds some use in it. 

I have to get to bed, early day tomorrow, but I will reply tomorrow after work if anybody wants to know anything else.",34

I feel really alone in all this as they don't quite understand me. I've been using for 3 years, I tried to get clean quite a few times. I got forced into rehab for some time, but started using again right after. This year, I was clean for 3 months, then i relapsed, then 2 months clean and last week i relapsed again. for a week long i used constantly and didn't want to stop and face reality. I started going to NA-meetings, which is really.. nice to be honest. But still, I feel alone and stuck in all this. I know why I want to stay clean, what it brings me, what smoking does to me, etc. But still I can't seem to stop destroying myself heh. Yesterday I went to a meeting, and they talked about: ""Step 1: Admitting powerlessness over addiction"" And quite some people shared about their moment where they were Fucking done with drugs and everything. I've had quite some moments like that but I still keep going back which makes me think: Am I really done with it all? I can't seem to understand myself and I feel stuck. If you're readin this: thanks for reading the whole thing haha. I could really ehm,. use some support from others.. Or someone to talk to.

**Basic Text, p. 107**

&#x200B;

Neglecting our recovery is like neglecting any  other gift we’ve been given.  Suppose someone gave you a new car.  Would  you let it sit in the driveway until the tires rotted?  Would you just  drive it, ignoring routine maintenance, until it expired on the road?   Of course not!  You would go to great lengths to maintain the condition  of such a valuable gift.

Recovery is also a gift, and we have to care  for it if we want to keep it.  While our recovery doesn’t come with an  extended warranty, there is a routine maintenance schedule.  This  maintenance includes regular meeting attendance and various forms of  service.  We’ll have to do some daily cleaning—our Tenth Step—and, once  in a while, a major Fourth Step overhaul will be required.  But if we  maintain the gift of recovery, thanking the Giver each day, it will  continue.

The gift of recovery is one that grows with the  giving.  Unless we give it away, we can’t keep it.  But in sharing our  recovery with others, we come to value it all the more.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  My recovery is a gift, and I want to keep it.  I’ll do the required maintenance, and I’ll share my recovery with others.

Anyway my main question is now that i'm back in my home town I grew up in life feels impossible, and I really mean that, I'm struggling to find reasons to keep on trying this so called 'better life'

Everyone I was friends with before has obviously moved on with their life, grown up a lot, and I just feel like i've missed years of my life that I'll never get back. For context my hometown is a Scottish island with about 25-30 thousand people, a place where everyone knows everyone, I moved south to a big city and lost contact with people from home, but I know everyone probably heard of my drug use, I feel like everyone I talk to is judging me and wanting to ask me questions like so are you still using etc. I don't want to settle here and get a job but at the same time I don't know if I trust myself to go back and not use again, that's what I did last time after a month and a half moved back and the next day boom I was back and another year flew by, now that i have my mum, sister, grandparents who I missed so much but rightfully cut me out back I feel like I owe them all and myself to at least give it a go.. I just feel like i've woken up from this 4-5 year dream and I'm learning to walk again in this scary fast world that I hardly know nothing about and my post drug addiction paranoid anxious self who used to not have a care in the world feels like i'm drowning all the time and the thought of all this sometimes feels so daunting I want to quit and go back to how I was before.. 

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have arranged to call my non-official sponsor, but more of a ‘second mom.’ She runs SMART recovery meetings. Her daughter, my best friend, passed away from addiction about 4 years ago. She was the first one I called this last time I needed help to sober up. She is happy to be of assistance. I appreciate everyone taking their time to tell me their experiences.

I’m back at the hotel. I called my sponsor twice. Walked away to breath when urges came up. Left when it was time and didn’t push it. I even had my husband pour my champagne for the toast into his glass.

**Serenity Prayer**

&#x200B;

Recovery involves change, and change means  doing things differently.  The problem is, many of us resist doing  things differently; what we’re doing may not be working, but at least  we’re familiar with it.  It takes courage to step out into the unknown.   How do we find that courage?

We can look around ourselves at NA meetings.   There, we see others who’ve found they needed to change what they were  doing and who’ve done so successfully.  Not only does that help quiet  our fear that change—any change—spells disaster, it also gives us the  benefit of their experience with what *does* work, experience we can use in changing what *doesn’t.*

We can also look at our own recovery  experience.  Even if that experience, so far, has been limited to  stopping the use of drugs, still we *have* made many changes in our  lives—changes for the good.  Whatever aspects of our lives we have  applied the steps to, we have always found surrender better than denial,  recovery superior to addiction.

Our own experience and the experience of others  in NA tells us that “changing the things I can” is a big part of what  recovery is all about.  The steps and the power to practice them give us  the direction and courage we need to change.  We have nothing to fear.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I welcome change.  With the help of my Higher Power, I will find the courage to change the things I can.

I had dentures made before I moved and the dentist hasn't contacted me, nor have they a swerved when I've called. I get put on hold for 20+ minutes, and I can't deal with it. I know a lot could be saved by me sucking it up and fighting through my anxiety, depression, ptsd, and whatnot, but it's not that simple. 

On the positive side I've quit smoking cigarettes/vaping. All I do is drink and smoke weed now(weed is legal where I moved to).

These old cravings for meth, heroin, anything that will remove me from this torment, are hitting hard and frequently. I'm constantly crying and having panic attacks, and it's really hard. I've been clean since.  ... I'll say December 1st 2020 cause I can't remember exactly, and it's been pretty chill, but I'm struggling so bad right now I'd really like to od on some boy and just go to sleep forever. 

Being sober and struggling like this is so hard. I have 4 ""friends"" here, only one had wanted to see me, the other just blow me off and ignore me. I don't blame them really, I'm a non entity that can only really engage with people when I'm not sober. 

I just want the bullshit to stop for a little bit. It's so hard to not relapse and just give in. It would be so much easier, so much more comfortable, and I wouldn't care about the effect my death would have on the couple family members that still give a shit. If anyone made it this far.

I'm 25 days sober from benzos, methadone, meth, and opiates. I feel like this foggy blanket has been lifted off me. I never thought I could feel this way as I've always been in constant states of dissociation one way or another. Everything is so clear but at the same time being in my body is rough. My nerve pain has really amped up and is getting almost unbearable. I can feel sounds, my skin is sensitive, and the pain while trying to sleep is torture. I didn't really have these problems during withdrawals so why now?

For a little background because of the unfortunate circumstances of my childhood I was drugged a lot with benzos and what else is anyone's guess. By the time I was a teen I had my own prescriptions along with add medication and by 19 to 20 I was starting to use opiates. I'm 28 so I can estimate around maybe 16 years of use at least? The majority of it is a blur so I'm not really certain how long I've been like this.

I guess what I'm wondering is how will this affect my long term recovery? What happens when drugs are introduced in such early adolescence and what does it do to a child's brain? Will it take longer for my nerves to recover or are they just shot at this point? What do I consider normal fatigue wise? And if anyone has a similar experience do you have any tips?",9

**Basic Text, p. 85**

&#x200B;

Everyone has secrets, right?  Some of us  have little secrets, items that would cause only minor embarrassment if  found out.  Some of us have big secrets, whole areas of our lives  cloaked in thick, murky darkness.  Big secrets may represent a more  obvious, immediate danger to our recovery.  But the little secrets do  their own kind of damage, the more insidious perhaps because we think  they’re “harmless.”

Big or little, our secrets represent  spiritual territory we are unwilling to surrender to the principles of  recovery.  The longer we reserve pieces of our lives to be ruled by  self-will and the more vigorously we defend our “right” to hold onto  them, the more damage we do.  Gradually, the unsurrendered territories  of our lives tend to expand, taking more and more ground.

Whether the secrets in our lives are big or  little, sooner or later they bring us to the same place.  We must  choose—either we surrender *everything* to our program, or we will lose our recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I want the kind of recovery that comes from total surrender to the program.  *Today*, I will talk with my sponsor and disclose my secrets, big or small.

Please  forgive if this post isn't at the right place here, but everything that  happened took place in AA and NA. I am absolutely not trying to criticize AA and NA  or anything. I just wanted your take on it, or some advice.

I'm  a 28F, 20 months sober. Since January, I've been had a sponsor who is  very nice but doesn't ever seem to reprimand me. She also seems very  busy and she often doesn't answer the phone and our stepwork sessions  often get cancelled. Sometimes because of her work, sometimes because  it's her wedding anniversary etc. To be honest, I don't feel as if I've  made that  much progress this year. For the record, I do at least 3  meetings per week and I have 3 service positions.

Then  a little while ago, a female fellow/'fella'  called M,  reached out to  me. She's 46 years old and nearly 2 years sober. She was primarily in NA  but wanted to transfer to AA.  She apparently had the same sponsor,  although I didn't know. She too felt very neglected by our sponsor. From  what M was telling me, I could make up that she had a problem with  pretty much everyone in NA. She was also telling me a heck of a lot of  gossip about people from the program. I didn't tell her to stop that,  which I know is wrong. But it gets worse. At some point, after nearly 2  days of listening to her gossip, I reached to one of the people she'd  been gossiping about and told her. I told person X that M had been  gossiping about her. X was obviously furious and called M up. M then  apparently turned the tables and now X has blocked me and from what I've  heard, never wants anything to do with me again. M then retaliated and  badmouthed me a guy from the program I had been seeing, and about whom I  had complained to her. Technically, I gossiped about him too, which  wasn't very nice of me. So now that guy has blocked me too.

I  know it's my fault that I told person X that M had been gossiping about  her. No clue why I did it. Certainly not spiritual of me to do. If I  hadn't done that, M wouldn't have retaliated.  Now my sponsor basically  lost it too. Not sure what to do here. Yeah, I guess the standard AA  answer would be to look at my own part and make amends. But at this  point, I just wanna leave.

TLDR: I engaged in gossip and now a few people have (been) turned against me.",15

**Basic Text, p. 13**

Many of us have always felt different from  other people.  We know we’re not unique in feeling that way; we hear  many addicts share the same thing.  We searched all our lives for  something to make us all right, to fix that “different” place inside us,  to make us whole and acceptable.  Drugs seemed to fill that need.  When  we were high, at least we no longer felt the emptiness or the need.   There was one drawback:  The drugs, which were our solution, quickly  became our problem.

Once we gave up the drugs, the sense of  emptiness returned.  At first we felt despair because we didn’t have any  solution of our own to that miserable longing.  But we were willing to  take direction and began to work the steps.  As we did, we found what  we’d been looking for, that “something different.”  Today, we believe  that our lifelong yearning was primarily for knowledge of a Higher  Power; the “something different” we needed was a relationship with a  loving God.  The steps tell us how to begin that relationship.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  My Higher Power is the  “something different” that’s always been missing in my life.  I will use  the steps to restore that missing ingredient to my spirit.

I will try to summarize everything because I write this in a state of great anxiety and bad condition in general.

I am 20 years old almost 21 and since I was 18 I have been abusing substances, first cannabis then together with alcohol, \* remember that my only options for weed is the one I get in the ghetto and it has an exaggerated amount of thc so the less more high you stay \* I clarify this because when consuming a cannabis so high in thc and little cbd the side effects exceed the benefits that I acquire from smoking, it should be clarified that I am diagnosed with OCD, GAD and recently ADHD. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of ADHD was in my 20s and I always had it as a child, but living in a country so poorly educated about mental health, I was never diagnosed correctly at school, I was only marginalized as someone restless, mischievous and lazy. Since I was a child I was always very restless, lazy without being able to be constant in anything, wanting to eat the world but jumping from project to project without successfully completing any.

But I honestly never victimized or self-conscious and I honestly have no complaints about my childhood. All thanks to my great pillar that is my family, they were always there for me at all times. They and the controlversial religion, I live in a very, very religious country and I always rely on it. I was very religious as a child, my parents educated me by putting God at the center of everything.

But one of those pillars broke in my 17s when I first separated from the church, for being very toxic and fanatic, then I began to have many doubts about the existence of God and decided to have an agnostic position about it, but at once it began. an anxiety of fear to go to hell for not believing and things like that because they literally brainwashed me with all that fanatic shit.

Right there I began to flirt with cannabis, which made me very introspective and I liked it, I managed to overcome that fear that the church instilled in me but when I was almost 18 I met the damn anxiety that I never knew what it was and why I felt that way until I read About GAD in my mid-18 when I was already abusing cannabis and alcohol, in my last year of high school I reached the point of smoking half a joint in the morning along with a couple of drinks of alcohol, there I knew I needed help, a psychiatrist unprofessional I prescribe bromazepam without warning me how addictive benzos are, I did not abuse much of bromazepam but when 2020 arrived I decided to make cold turkey with everything and then I met my second demon, the damn OCD, I could not last more than two weeks and I decided to go to another psychiatrist, I was prescribed with rivotril 2 mg ONLY x two weeks and one ssri, I decided not to take ssri and abuse clonazepam in doses of up to 4-6mg daily because in my country it is too easy to have access to prescriptions for controlled substances. In short, I abused half of 2020 of rivos, dxm, weed. Until one day I made a mixture of dxm, tramadol and when I was taking paroxetine and mirtazapine it gave me a serious serotonin sindorm because at the time I was very ignorant about it, in short, I was almost left with serious sequelae and flirtation close to death, even a couple of times more until the confinement arrived in my country and that in part put a brake on me also that I decided to gradually stop benzos for the entire other half of 2020, and well, 2021 arrives, I am much better I was taking 20 mg of lexapro that helped me a lot but in my country pregabalin is otc so I abused it taking high doses on weekends until I decided to take ritalin and went back to clonazepam, both self-medicated, I abused little or almost no ritalin is more the first 3 months of 2021 were spectacular, I had completely given up alcohol and cannabis also for the first time in my life I was able to focus on studying and I managed to enter university, I was finally able to have a stable relationship with someone and I regained contact with many friends, in part all those achievements I owe to ritalin but I had to leave it because I had to go into detoxification because I had abused the damn benzos again, since May 2021 I have been reducing from 4 mg of clonazepam right now I am on 5 mg but in the course of all these months it has been a real hell in life because I had to leave the girl I loved, I did not want to submerge her with me in my spiral of self-destruction, I had returned to alcohol stronger than ever and substance abuse, I got away from everyone and immersed myself in my misery alone, until one day I said enough and decided to seek help almost shouting, for a month and two weeks I have been without drinking and almost a month without smoking but recently I was also diagnosed with adhd but I was not medically treated about it since the only drug available for such a condition in my country is methylphenidate and because I was coming out of substance abuse it was not prescribed for me, but until recently because I was very frustrated with not being able to be constant in anything, I decided to self-medicate again with ritalin but I feel a lot of guilt about it and since I am reducing two anxiety medications at the same time benzos (there are only 5 weeks left) and pregabaliana AKA lyrica (I am starting) gives me a I came down with a lot of anxiety after taking the only medication that helps me with my condition, it is very difficult to suffer from severe anxiety aggravated by substance abuse and pronounced adhd. Three weeks ago I had left the cold turkey pregabalin, serious mistake, I could not sleep for two days, I had never been awake so long, I do not want to go back to that moment so I will only say that it was the lowest I have felt in all my life, That decision made me totally unable to give my classes at the university so I decided to quit and three weeks have passed I resumed the pregabalin but to reduce it I am on 100 mg of zoloft that only helps my OCD and I am against the sword and the wall because I will go back to teaching, I will have to catch up and it is difficult for me to concentrate I do not think I will continue with ritalin unless it is prescribed by a professional but I do not know if I can do everything ...

If you have come this far, from the heart thank you very much for reading everything

I needed to vent a little and I do not know if this is the place, I wish that with this post many go to a professional before thinking about self-medicating and please do not fuck with benzos and that kind of addictive shit. From all the good vibes I wish you a good day and excuse my English :)",11

 • Psych made me take Xanax 0.5 mg before for almost 2 months and tapered only for 2-3 weeks.
 • Wasn't able to handle withdrawal, got a bad case of insomnia, consulted to a sleep doctor and changed my medication to Clonazepam 2mg, to be taken 1/2 tab before sleeping every night, good for almost a month.
 • Day 7 of no Clonazepam since I ran out of doses, having withdrawal symptoms again.
 • Contacted my sleep doctor and planning to administer a taper program for Clonazepam, since other symptoms are not improving.

Question:
 • Do you think it's still advisable to taper? Or would it be better to tell my doctor to prescribe me with alternatives to help me sleep well instead of going back to Clonazepam?",4

I was addicted to heroin, Xanax, ketamine and tbh, anything that got me high and away from reality. I was addicted to Xanax for 5 years and heroin 7 months.

I was an unemployed, severely unhealthy, homeless drug addict. My hobbies used to be playing football and making music, I stopped playing football 6 years ago, just as I was getting into drugs. 

I’ve been unemployed now for almost 2 years. I went from 64kg down to 52kg. I barely ate one meal a day. 

Drugs took over my life, I didn’t wanna do anything but drugs. Everyday I would ask anyone and everyone for money so I could get my fix. All day and night, all I’d think about was drugs. I lost all my friends and my family were slowly giving up on me, I was genuinely rock bottom. I’ve had two seizures in the past tryna get clean. 

June 4th, I moved away to live with my nan (June 10th I turned 24). I moved to a place I had no access to drugs and didn’t know anyone, it was my only option. 

My life needed to change, I had to start making different choices otherwise I didn’t know how much longer I’d be alive. 

Now, I’m clean! I’ve got a job! I joined a Sunday league football team! My health is better than ever, I now weigh 62kg (put on 10kg). I’m finally starting my driving lessons and I’ve started going to the gym and working out. 

My family are sooo fckn proud of me! I’m proud of me! Feeling pride after half a decade of not feeling anything but depression is absolutely amazing! 

I thought it was impossible for me to turn my life round like this but I made different choices and suffered but now I’m reaping the rewards! 

Ive been clean 98 days now (and counting!) 

Believe in yourself! That’s the first step. 

I’ve got myself back! I have my life back.. I mean fuck, I actually have a life now!! This feeling is unmatched.",49

So about a year ago my friends and I got heavily into raves. It opened me up to a lot of drug use that younger me would’ve never imagined doing.

I never noticed until about 4-5 months ago that I hardly have recollection of memories from when I was younger, couldn’t hold a conversation, and blatantly couldn’t remember most of almost anything I knew. It’s caused severe depression and suicidal thoughts now and they take over. I can’t feel emotions. I sleep like absolute shit. I’ll try my absolute best to tell myself it’s going to be a good day and they still run across my head. Will my brain be this damaged for life? It’s caused a pretty major boundary in my relationship and now we’ve got a child on the way. I just want to be naturally happy again and be the dad I always wanted to be.",10

**Basic Text, p. 82**

&#x200B;

Many of us come into Narcotics Anonymous  feeling pretty poorly about ourselves.  By comparison, the recovering  addicts we meet at meetings may seem almost superhumanly serene.  These  wise, loving people have many months, even years of living in accordance  with spiritual principles, giving of themselves to others without  expecting anything back.  We trust them, allowing them to love us until  we can love ourselves.  We expect them to make everything alright again.

Then the glow of early recovery begins to fade,  and we start to see the human side of our NA friends and sponsor.   Perhaps a fellow member of our home group stands us up for a coffee  date, or we see two oldtimers bickering at a committee meeting, or we  realize our sponsor has a defect of character or two.  We’re crushed,  disillusioned—these recovering addicts aren’t perfect after all!  How  can we possibly trust them anymore?

Somewhere between “the heroes of recovery” and  “the lousy NA bums” lies the truth:  Our fellow addicts are neither  completely bad nor completely good.  After all, if they were perfect,  they wouldn’t need this program.  Our friends and sponsor are ordinary  recovering addicts, just like we are.  We can relate to their ordinary  recovery experience and use it in our own program.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  My friends and my sponsor are human, just like me—and I trust their experience all the more for that.

**Basic Text, p. 35**

&#x200B;

Many of us have lived our entire lives in  revolt.  Our initial response to any type of direction is often  negative.  Automatic rejection of authority seems to be a troubling  character defect for many addicts.

A thorough self-examination can show us how we  react to the world around us.  We can ask ourselves if our rebellion  against people, places, and institutions is justified.  If we keep  writing long enough, we can usually get past what others did and uncover  our own part in our affairs.  We find that what others did to us was  not as important as how we responded to the situations we found  ourselves in.

Regular inventory allows us to examine the  patterns in our reactions to life and see if we are prone to chronic  rebelliousness.  Sometimes we will find that, while we may usually go  along with what is suggested to us rather than risk rejection, we  secretly harbor resentments against authority.  If left to themselves,  these resentments can lead us away from our program of recovery.

The inventory process allows us to uncover,  evaluate, and alter our rebellious patterns. We can’t change the world  by taking an inventory, but we can change the way we react to it.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I want freedom from the turmoil of rebelliousness.  Before I act, I will inventory myself and think about my true values.

Sadly I have just relapsed for the 7th time (on a combo of benzos, kratom, phenibut, and the occasional coke binge). It is fair to say that I am reaching my breaking point with addiction. I simply do not know how to break the loop. It is my 7th time so I feel like I'm getting closer and closer, and simply learning what my triggers are, but yet here I am.

Personally I'm not much of a texter, or a caller really. I like to talk to people face to face. 

I've been to NA multiple times, with no success. It seemed to just be a bunch of people reding verses from some book that sounded like the Bible. Before I insult anyone, I'm sure this book has saved countless lives, but personally no matter how much I tried I could not get it to help me. Frankly I wanted to to talk about why people took the substance in the first place? Why people felt inclined to keep taking it? What people's triggers were and what they did to control them? And if they were completely clean from the stuff, what was there final solution to kick It for good?

I have an incredible group of friends and family who have relentlessly supported me through my multiple relapses, but I would like to speak in person with someone who actually has or has had a serious drug addiction.



I live I Cambridge, UK, 26, male. 

The way I pictured it was we would all meet midday at a coffee shop in a relatively crowded location. This way everyone would feel safe.


Please tell me if I am

1. Breaking one of the subreddits rules
2. am being completely unaware of a much easier way to do this
3. Being a complete moron in some way

Is this a common issue with quitting substances? I feel like I'm dropping all of my bad habits, but picking up another one in place of the others. Have tried drinking lots of water and other tools to help with it, but none seem to be working. I could be full and still just want to eat EVERYTHING.

Now I'm sober and strongly against the mind-altering substances.

Today was sort of a family gathering and I clearly stated that I'm not going to drink. Felt no cravings and my mood was quite alright. There was this one lady who's my distant relative who knew about my previous struggles, but it isn't me who told her so we both pretend like she doesn't know because I haven't said a word about it.

First thing, after I stated my sober point she (ironically?) asked my why I didn't quit smoking if I'm not going to drink today. Lady like how the fuck it's your business?

Second, when she was already drunk to the point of talking non-stop, singing and dancing, she went out to the balcony where I was sitting with a cigarette after my workout session. Asked me about my workout, this is where I got engaged in the conversation and started telling her about some nuances. I got quite gesticulating and made my voice clearer and louder since I was telling her about the thing I love.

And that's where she interrupted me with a line: ""Why are you acting like that? Waving your hands here and there! You think it's cool, why you got to show off like this? You're acting like a complete druggie!"". I was shocked and my response was something like ""What?.. I'm just interested in that topic and you know that I'm very emotional by nature."". After that I shut down into my thoughts.

FUCK. In that moment my head wasn't quite clear since I was resting after a long heavy workout. And her words even made me question myself and did shaken my self-confidence a lot.

I don't know how to feel about it now. Don't wanna talk with her ever again, not a single time in my life. You're not my family member if you're not even showing compassion but going straight offensive on my trauma-related topic.",3

I have an estranged, alcoholic, and destructive father with whom I have no contact. This is very relevant to the below story due to the fact that because of the existing relationship with my father, I swore to myself I could not involve myself with another destructive addict.

Story
Basically, my fiancé is a drug addict and I'm not sure what to do about it: if I should leave him or stay and try and work through it.

In early June 2021, I caught him crushing up oxycontin to snort. He tried to lie about it but quickly admitted it after I told him I knew something was up. He admitted he started the habit after being cooped up in his office from working hard through covid and being isolated in his office for days on end and becoming a bit depressed because of this. He has had no history of depression in the past that I know of but was forced to go to an outpatient facility in his teens (17) for smoking marijuana (very strict/religious mother). I work nights so our time together has always been a bit finicky. He told me he took the pills orally for 8 to 9 weeks until he decided to snort them for only this last week, so a 10-week habit in total. He has smoked weed almost daily since I met him also and has done so since College (we're 29). He got the pills of the dark web.

We then agreed to then spend some time apart, as he had his parent's house to go to and I had nowhere to go aside from the house we own together. He immediately found a drug counselor whom he saw weekly, and also committed to going to NA meetings. I have met this counselor, whom I like and think is a good fit for him.

We spent about 8 weeks apart. During that time he was with his parents and attended NA meetings daily, working towards their ""90 meetings in 90 days"". His parents kept a close eye on him per both our requests, so he wasn't using during this time period.
About 2 weeks ago we then started to live together again after about 9 weeks from the initial incident.
Things were great, we were happy, we had sex, we did fun things together. He continued to go to meetings and communicate with individuals from those meetings (step work wasn't his thing due to lack of a higher power), he was more active, going to the gym, eating more, etc.
Then yesterday as his workday was ending, I was napping on the couch but got suspicious when he sneakily went upstairs into his old office (he moved his computer stuff downstairs when he moved back in). Lo and behold he was crushing up a pill to snort.

Justifiably I freaked out and asked him wtf.. he told me to drug test him as this was a ""trophy"" he had kept to see if he could beat this while still hanging onto a small amount, mentioning that he thought that if he could keep some and not use it, he had ""beaten it"", those were his words. Obviously that failed. The drug tests came back negative for everything, he also took another test that evening to prove it even further.

I'm at a crossroads here because I had said after the first incident that if I ever found him doing any drugs, weed included, ever again, that I was done. So here we are... what would you do if you were in this situation??

Thanks so much for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR: Caught my fiancé doing drugs, he swore he wouldn't do them again, he got clean for almost 90 days, then I caught him doing drugs again. What do?

Bit More Info:
I'm not sure if I can entirely afford to live on my own
I still love him very much so
We've been dating for over 4 years, engaged for a little over 1 year
I do not quite understand the ""addict"" mindset",6

Anyone else who has had serious blow addiction chime in and let me know of what long term psychological improvement I can expect to see over time. 

Basocally I'm still talking to my self in tourettes style outbursts.  

I cant control them. 

It just comes out.  

I never did them until I did a massive bender. Then they became regular like inflicked a switch.

Talking to oneself is normal.  Talking alot to one self . Yeh not so much. I get to talk to people thru my day in work but yeh.  Leave me alone and I talk. Not like answering my self. Just vocalising and uncontrolled outbursts. 

Things are better. I'm not down thousands every week. I'm sleeping and exercising albeit isolated by lockdown and I'm just an average male in late 30s . 

I'm bi polar 2. So the meds I guess have started working again as I doubt they helped for the year that I blew a shit ton ifnfkake uo my nose.

In a normal world I would pack my bags and go travel and do stuff thst I haven't done fir years while iwas building the means ti support such a costly addiction. 

I'm much better than I . But yeb. Just frustrated in this ongoing ""oh that's one crazy dude"" sort if stuff.

Sorry for the phone formatting.  I have fat fingers. 

I long for the stability I had before I got on coke. I was addicted to weed since a kid and spent 5 years drinking heavily. Im in my 5th year w no drinks and 4 yeara no weed. Coke came out of no where . Can't have a coke addiction unless u can pay for it.

Withdrawal was easy once I got the will power .

I know good times will roll again. I miss yoga which o practiced for 3 years in early recovery. I did weights the other 2. 

Just want the leg shaking nervousness , outbursts and overall emptiness to end.

I half cleaned my drug den today. Gotnrid of hundreds of bags. I guess that's something",24

I’m utterly broke otherwise. I’m having trouble scraping together money for steel toe boots that I’ll need next week but I’ll figure it out. 

I don’t want to start up again. I’m literally scared I’ll die otherwise. I’m hoping work gives me enough time away from using to keep me occupied. 

I’m living rent free in a homelessness program but my roommate is a dealer. I can’t afford to live anywhere else. I don’t want to go back to being on the street. That got me using every single day. I barely have enough money to get me to work every day. 

I’m pulling myself together. Yet again. I don’t know if I dare allow myself hope yet again that I can quit. I’ve been trying hard not to leave before the miracle happens but it’s been well over a decade and the miracle hasn’t happened yet. 

I’m so lonely. And if this goes down the tubes yet again I think I’ll probably die and I won’t care. 


I don’t know why I’m posting this. Encouragement?  Advice? Some kind of human contact that doesn’t result in drug use? Or maybe I’m just bitching. IDK.",50
