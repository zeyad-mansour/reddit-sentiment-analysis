**Basic Text, p. 42**

&#x200B;

Taking a regular inventory is a key element in  our new pattern of living.¬† In our addiction, we examined ourselves as  little as possible.¬† We weren‚Äôt happy with how we were living our lives,  but we didn‚Äôt feel that we could change the way we lived.¬†  Self-examination, we felt, would have been a painful exercise in  futility.

Today, all that is changing.¬† Where we were  powerless over our addiction, we‚Äôve found a Power greater than ourselves  that has helped us stop using.¬† Where we once felt lost in life‚Äôs maze,  we‚Äôve found guidance in the experience of our fellow recovering addicts  and our ever-improving contact with our Higher Power.¬† We need not feel  trapped by our old, destructive patterns.¬† We can live differently if  we choose.

By establishing a regular pattern of taking our  own inventory, we give ourselves the opportunity to change anything in  our lives that doesn‚Äôt work.¬† If we‚Äôve started doing something that  causes problems, we can start changing our behavior before it gets  completely out of hand.¬† And if we‚Äôre doing something that prevents  problems from occurring, we can take note of that, too, and encourage  ourselves to keep doing what works.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† I will make a commitment to include a regular inventory in my new pattern of living.

I am 66 years old. I lost count how many times I had starts and stops, but today I have not had a drop of alcohol in 8 days. I recently returned home from a detox center because I live alone and was scared of possible seizures or extreme withdrawal syptoms. That detox center was very uncomfortable, but I managed to stick it out until they said I was ready to go go home.

I come here to listen to new ideas how to sustain sobriety. I am connected online to a sobriety email group and they are very supportive, but maybe I can see my progress (like journaling) as I move forward with my journey.

While I was in Detox, I attended classes about topics such as triggers, PAWS, relapse prevention, meditation, hydrate, don't forget to eat, adequate rest, and coping skills. I need to dig out those handouts to read again. I just feel very fragile and vulnerable right now. I have cataract surgery next month, so I am unable to get to face to face meetings becuse driving too far out is dangerous due to poor vision.  


Also, I found out that many products have alcohol in them, so I am tossing things like mouthwash, hair spray, etc. I don't want to chance any form of ethonol in my blood system.

Our behavior toward other people in our life  is a mirror of our behavior toward ourselves.¬† When we demand  perfection of ourselves, we come to demand it from others around us,  too.¬† As we strive to repair and heal our lives in recovery, we may also  expect others to work just as hard and to recover at the same pace as  we do.¬† And just as we are often unforgiving of our own mistakes, we may  shut out friends and family members when they don‚Äôt meet our  expectations.

Working the steps helps us understand our  own limitations and our humanity.¬† We come to see our failures as human  mistakes.¬† We realize that we will never be perfect, that we will, at  times, disappoint ourselves and others.¬† We hope for forgiveness.

As we learn to gently accept ourselves, we  can start to view others with the same accepting and tolerant heart.¬†  These people, too, are only human, trying to do their best and sometimes  falling short.

A guy that used to live in the house i'm in now moved out last month, he had been here for over a year.. I felt concerned when he would describe his using days to me.  Seemed like his entire motivation not to use was because of these charges he was facing and looking at some prison time if he didnt fly straight.  Not really working a program.  This dude in the span of like 2 weeks has lost his job thinks people are spying on him, lost his keys, slept in his car outside some gas station living in a hotel because the place he moved kicked him out right away.  Another guy I went to rehab with relapsed after his dad died a few months ago and fell down drunk hit his head and died.  I see people get kicked out of here pretty much once a month because they'll show up drunk or high.

Every single time it's a huge reminder to keep doing the next right thing and stay plugged into the 12 step work.  It's never pretty.  I've been that guy too, relapsed in a sober house and had to go back to treatment.  I guess people just need to have these experiences to get desperate to stay sober.  That desperation is really important, once you just flat out know for a fact that you are 10000% completely fucked every single time you do any sort of drug that changes your mindset.. it's a little easier to start doing whatever the fuck it takes to keep that from happening.",45

**Basic Text, p. 32**

&#x200B;

Having relationships without barriers, ones in  which we can be entirely open with our feelings, is something many of us  desire.¬† At the same time, the possibility of such intimacy causes us  more fear than almost any other situation in life.

If we examine what frightens us, we‚Äôll usually  find that we are attempting to hide an aspect of our personalities that  we are ashamed of, an aspect we sometimes haven‚Äôt even admitted to  ourselves.¬† We don‚Äôt want others to know of our insecurities, our pain,  or our neediness, so we simply refuse to expose them.¬† We may imagine  that if no one knows about our imperfections, those imperfections will  cease to exist.

This is the point where our relationships  stop.¬† Anyone who enters our lives will not get past the point at which  our secrets begin.¬† To maintain intimacy in a relationship, it is  essential that we acknowledge our defects and accept them.¬† When we do,  the fortress of denial, erected to keep these things hidden, will come  crashing down, enabling us to build up our relationships with others.

2021-07-28 01:15:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ot3eqs/11_months_sober_and_its_been_a_ride/,11 months sober and it's been a ride,"I was always so focused on how I appeared. My status. Being liked and admired. And that was the problem.   


I never even stopped long enough to see that inside I was broken. Crumbled. Spiritually bankrupt and unwilling to face the accumulated pain. Getting high was fun, initially. 

&#x200B;

But as the weekends ended and most my friends went back to their normal life, I continued to seek out the numbing and distraction daily.

SO unwilling to feel anything I deemed as negative or difficult. And it worked! It worked like a fucking charm. 

I always found a way to score and I always found a new cocktail of drugs and distractions. Anything to keep me from having to take a deep look at.... well..... me.   


Anything other than to face the pain of a young boy abandoned by his father.   
Anything besides having to deal with difficulty and drudgery of life.   
Anything besides feeling bored, disengaged, alone, and aware of my mortality. 

Anything besides facing my imperfect self as I was. 

  
And most of all, anything besides not ever feeling like enough. 

The drugs worked incredibly well. They worked incredibly well for a very short time. 

And then the anxiety came back stronger. 

The loneliness came back stronger. 

The self doubt, the resentment, the not feeling like enough ripped through me like an armored tank driving through a doll house.   


I never examined the underlying issues, and I could never figure out why the appeal of instant gratification in a pill, or on foil, or powder, or in a seductive cloud of smoke was SO fucking intense. 

It was never enough. I used anything I could get my hands on to the point of mental and physical exhaustion or black out regularly. 

It worked in the short term and it dug me a little deeper each time. 15 years later I stood at the bottom of a hardened pit hundreds of feet deep with no ladder and no one to throw a rope down. I was skating by in life, and while I failed to meet most of my commitments, I was doing just enough to keep things looking ok from the outside.   


Inside I knew I had failed myself, my family, my colleagues, my communities, and my partner of 7 years who left me. After a 5 day binge that nearly killed me I decided it was enough.   


I took 1 piece of suboxone from a friend, and then quit everything cold turkey. It was a very rough first few weeks with 2 hours of sleep many nights. I almost broke multiple times, but I reminded myself that the best version of myself chooses to do difficult things. He chooses to sacrifice feeling good now for a BEING good tomorrow. He chooses life and thriving over death or surviving.   


The brain fog hung around for a few months. I didn't feel normal. I still felt diseased and resentful that addiction has plagued me for so much of my life. I felt like shit about wasting some of the most formative and highest growth potential years of my life.   


At 6 months something really shifted. I started feeling good just being alive. It was strange but so welcome.   


I'm coming up on a year, and I've still got a ton of work to do, but my life is getting better in tiny ways regularly. I feel impulse and I let it float on by instead of acting on it. I don't drive my way in social settings like I used to every time. I feel my arrogance and grandiosity subsiding. I don't feel the need to manipulate things to my benefit as often. I'm choosing to take on more responsibility in my life. I now see that I am imperfect and that is OK. I now FEEL things again.   


What a strange and confusing process that is. I didn't know I had so many feelings, and I didn't realize that they could be such wise guides on my path up the mountain. The pain is a part of my life, and it seems that the more I allow myself to feel it, the more accepting I become and the more humbled I am by it. As I allow myself to be a fallible human, I become more thankful to even be alive and to have this opportunity for growth. As I become more honest about who I am, I draw opportunities and people into my life that recognize my sincerity and are starting to care more about me. Of course it all started by caring more about myself.   


Being clean and sober is everything I wanted it to be. It's hard. It's messy to be faced with the reality that I put off for so long. But most of all, it's 100% worth the work.   


I'd like to share some strategies and resources that worked well for me, in case they may be of service in your journey.   


\- Threw or gave away all of my drugs and paraphernalia. This is a simple but critical system to ensuring you have a SPACE and TIME to consider your next action before potentially relapsing, as opposed to not having any time to stop and reflect if those things are conveniently around you. 

&#x200B;

\- Got a life coach. While this is expensive at 12 sessions for $2,000, having a space to be non-judgmentally listened to helped me generate all sorts of solutions on my own. The other biggest part is the personalized accountability here.   


\- Went to SMART recovery meetings (free in your city or on zoom). Hearing other addicts discuss their pain and journey made me feel less alone about mine. I also read posts here regularly.   


\- A friend serendipitously recommended I read ""12 Rules for Life"" before I had decided to quit. Reading this book and taking to heart that I needed to grow up, delay gratification, and take responsibility for my life may have saved my life. Jordan Peterson is the father I never had. 

&#x200B;

\- Created a Google Form and sent it to 10 people I care about. I asked a litany of questions about my internal world and my character and how others perceive it and are affected by it. ""On a scale of 1-10, rate how much you feel that I value you, your time and your things."" ""Explain a situation in which I hurt you and why you felt that way."" Having this raw and honestly, painful feedback from people I cared about was a big motivator to change and evolve. My only goal this year was to improve by 1 point on every single thing I asked my friends about in this survey over the course of 1 year. I'm excited to send those same people the same survey and see if I have progressed in their eyes, as well as fill it out myself and see how far I've come.  


\- Did the 12 steps self led by reading Russel Brands book ""Freedom from our addictions."" The most valuable part was writing out long answers to all of the questions at the end of each chapter.  Just a few paragraphs each week, and eventually I had filled many pages. This really helped me work out a lot of the painful memories and shitty feelings I had repressed or numbed my whole life.  


I hope some of what I shared in my journey is helpful to you, and please know that we NEED you to be a productive and engaged member of society. We NEED to fully see the unique gifts that you and you alone can bring to this world. We NEED your light in this often dark place.   


We will never see your light unless you start the fire. Today is the best day to ignite it.",17

I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.

While going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.

One day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.

One day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.

Feeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!",70

That was in October 2020. Since then the longest he's been clean is 1 or 2 months but the voices have never stopped. 

Has anyone experienced someone being in a psychosis this long and ever getting out of it? He's going into treatment tomorrow for 3 months so we're hopeful he'll be able to complete the program and stay clean when he gets out but his mental health team doesn't know if the voices will ever go away. Any experience, strength, and hope would be appreciated.",10

Just being able to breathe again and feel a little. I relapsed..... I don't know when, sometime in spring. It was rough man, going back to my DoCs like that after almost a year clean and just hitting it harder than I ever had before..... it just wasn't good man. 

I can make every excuse in the book, I've been making them for months. ""I couldn't concentrate and I needed to graduate"", ""my friend in recovery committed suicide"", ""My meetings are just drama from other people"". I mean anything to keep me on my DoCs.... which there's three that I chase after and really require all of them. I won't go into detail about that, it's just one drug required the other or my stomach would be upset and the third was to wake me up from the other two. I use to have a fourth, but I made the right choice and told my doctor about my abuse over a year ago and he won't give me a script anymore. Thank you.... thank you for being a mitigating factor and not an enabling one.

I'm going through some pink clouds!! Which I love, it's one of the only parts about getting clean that actually feels aight. I cry sometimes of course, guilt and shit and garbage floats to the surface when your clean. I knew it was coming, and I'm ready for it. 

I get sad for the things I did this time. In all my years of abuse before my relapse I never did shit I was doing this time. Hypersexual, no inhibition, little ambition beyond sex and drugs. I mean the list can go on and on. For the last months I've had more partners than I have had in the last TEN YEARS. Yes, I got checked, all good. Normally I try to stick to someone, not this time, the stranger the better.... it just not cool dude... like at all. 

I was using drugs to get laid, because recovery made me realize how vulnerable addicts really are.... that's the horrible part. You know, my addiction, it all started with sex, love and all of the trappings that came with it, including the pain. Which I used drugs to cover up this time, because I realized I could. Soo, lots of guilt, lots of pain and little to no reward....that I can honestly recall in any sort of detail. Soo, I'm beating myself up pretty hard. I've texted the people I hooked up with, they're all fine and no ones hurt by what I did but it's how I did it that bothers me. These are fellow addicts, and I did that.... special place in hell for people like me, and I wasn't one of those people before....

My higher power is still chillin around, which is awesome. He never left me, just was a bemused voice in the back my head going ""you sure about all this"" to which I would say ""are you seeing how the fuck I'm living? fuck yes"" and he'd just laugh and laugh, cuz he knew where I was heading for, right back to recovery. The faster I burned, the faster I was going to make it there.

I need to go back to meetings, I need to go an IRL meeting.....but I'm struggling to make that jump. I can't place why, I need to place why I don't want to go to meetings. Last time it helped soo much to talk and listen, and eventually I did service for the meetings and even chaired a few. I pull out the Big book and read it, and within 20 minutes I put it down, bored out of my mind. Because I've read it, about 50 times in the last year. I know what the fuck it says lol, I can still recite most of the traditions and steps by heart etc. Soo, I don't really know what my problem is there. There's a block, because I for sure miss the fellowship, it's a needed thing if my recovery is to be successful. I've got some time of course to decide what to do, I'm not alone, I'm not miserably sick and I'm not having bad thoughts because of the wonderful pink clouds that have followed me all day. Which is why this is a novel lmao. Pink clouds beat the fuck out drugs any day. 

For me, it's all about one day at a time now, that's how it worked before. I won't be able to fully discover what went wrong and why I relapsed until I get to meetings. I need the support for that journey into my fucked up brain.

Love yall, good to say that again and feel it.

In the last year, my drinking has gotten as bad as it can get. On May 10th, 2021, I was hospitalized after drinking too much. My father came to stay with me for two weeks after my trip to the ER and I managed to stay sober for just over a month after being hospitalized, but I had a lapse in the middle of June and, as of the last few weeks, I'm going through a full relapse. This is the first ""relapse"" I have had, and I say that because the 30+ days of sobriety I maintained immediately after being hospitalized was the longest I can remember being sober in at least the last three years, so I would categorize my current situation as a full relapse. I'm at work right now‚ÄîI've been here since 8am. Before work, I stopped by the gas station across the street to buy a couple of beers. It's a miracle that I'm still functioning, but I'm hopeful that this journey will get me toward healing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've been seeing a counselor at school, but decided to see an addiction specialist off campus and get ahead of this, before it gets worst. I wanted to ask‚Äîwhat gets you through? I already gave my parents a big scare, and now I'm starting to ruin the relationships I've built with my friends. I'm still managing school well (sort of) but I'm on an unsustainable trajectory. I withdrew from my first semester of grad school last year due to drinking and general stress, but did really well this past semester, despite my drinking and my trip to the ER around finals week. I'm finally ready to get on the road to heal my body and mind.

There is no such thing as a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù Twelfth  Step call.¬† Even if our prospect doesn‚Äôt get clean, we have accomplished  two purposes.¬† We have planted the seed of recovery in the mind of the  addict with whom we have shared our experience, strength, and hope.¬† And  we ourselves have stayed clean another day.¬† Rarely does a recovering  addict leave a Twelve Step call with anything but a deep dose of  gratitude.

Sometimes we are practicing the Twelfth Step  without realizing it.¬† When our co-workers or other acquaintances know  some of our history and see what kind of person we are today, they know  where to go when they have a friend or loved one in need of our help.¬†  We are often the best attraction that NA has to offer!

For many addicts, the Twelfth Step is the  cornerstone of recovery.¬† We truly believe that ‚Äúwe can only keep what  we have by giving it away.‚Äù¬† The paradox of the Twelfth Step is evident,  for in giving, we receive.

Sobriety. Relapse. Recovery. My story.

Addiction is such a cruel disease. While we‚Äôre using, we feel guilty about it and wish we could control it. While we‚Äôre ‚Äúsober‚Äù we‚Äôre in our heads battling temptation, until we eventually relapse again. Did this dance off and on for over 20 years. 

For me, it wasn‚Äôt pretty. I didn‚Äôt hit rock bottom. I lived there. I wasted so much time trying to understand this disease when I should have just accepted it. I‚Äôve been in and out of AA, in and out of detoxes, but this last time, I tried to end it all by taking a bunch of pills, and wasn‚Äôt successful. My mom found me and called 911. I remember the EMTs were all young and asking me why I did this. I remember my answer. I said ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm almost 40, I live with my parents, and I hate my job.‚Äù I broke down sobbing. I was freshly divorced due to my drinking, I no longer had my kids with me all the time, and life was definitely not where I‚Äôd hoped it‚Äôd be. 

They took me to the hospital. I got my stomach pumped. I couldn‚Äôt even succeed at that. I laid in that hospital bed for days while someone who I didn‚Äôt know sat in the room with me observing. I felt like the biggest fuck up ever. But I also finally felt like I did not want to feel that way anymore, ever again! That‚Äôs what it took for me. 

That was last year. Not a lot of time under my belt, but now I make an intentional decision every day to abstain and grow. Since then, I‚Äôve done A LOT of reflecting. I do everything now with mindful intention. When I go to work, I make it a decision to do the very best I can that day. Then I do better the next. I do this with every aspect of my life. My parenting, my self-improvement, my finances, my sobriety. Everything has changed for the better because I set my intentions for only that day to do my very best at whatever the hell it is I‚Äôm doing that day. 

Since last year, I‚Äôve been promoted,  I‚Äôve been able to save money. I‚Äôve taught myself how to invest. I‚Äôm learning Spanish. I‚Äôm learning about computers. I‚Äôve made meaningful healthy friendships. Most importantly though, I‚Äôve made a deep connection with my kids and am always honest and open with them. I am no longer in pain. I am free. And finally I am content.",92

**Basic Text, p. 33**

&#x200B;

Over-sensitivity, insecurity, and lack of  identity are often associated with active addiction.¬† Many of us carry  these with us into recovery; our fears of inadequacy, rejection, and  lack of direction do not disappear overnight.¬† Many of us have images,  false personalities we have constructed either to protect ourselves or  please others.¬† Some of us use masks because we‚Äôre not sure who we  really are.¬† Sometimes we think that these images, built to protect us  while using, might also protect us in recovery.

We use false fronts to hide our true  personality, to disguise our lack of self-esteem.¬† These masks hide us  from others and also from our own true selves.¬† By living a lie, we are  saying that we cannot live with the truth about ourselves.¬† The more we  hide our real selves, the more we damage our self-esteem.

One of the miracles of recovery is the  recognition of ourselves, complete with assets and liabilities.¬†  Self-esteem begins with this recognition.¬† Despite our fear of becoming  vulnerable, we need to be willing to let go of our disguises.¬† We need  to be free of our masks and free to trust ourselves.

&#x200B;

You've all given me some things to think about and I have just a little more hope for the future. I appreciate every one of you and I'm going to do my absolute best to get back on track. Much love.

I'm 24 and I've been struggling with opioid addiction since I was 16. I detoxed myself for the third time in March this year and have been using sporadically for the last month or so. I've been riding a fine line between consuming the drugs and having the drugs consume me, and I'm worried this will be the dose that pushes me over the edge. It's only a matter of time.

I don't even feel good right now, just guilty and isolated. It's not worth it. There's so many good reasons not to go down this road and only a handful of reasons to do it. But it feels impossible to consistently use logic to work my way out of an urge to use that feels so primal, on par with being thirsty after working outside on a hot day. It's a constant uphill battle, and I'm so tired. 

I almost died this year from blood clots in my lungs, likely due to my drug use. And somehow even that isn't a good enough deterrent. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and constantly fighting this beast of addiction makes the future look bleak. Every time I try to get myself back up, I eventually end up returning to the devil I know instead of facing the unknown. Will it always be this way? 

I lost my mother when I was 10. I think the opioids are a way of coping with this event that I was never able to move past, but when I think about that time, there are no emotions. Just numbness. So many traumatic experiences since have been brought on by my careless actions, and I feel too damaged to ever recover. I never had the guidance I needed to face life and its challenges and I'm hopelessly lost. I don't feel like I deserve to be happy or healthy. 

I guess I just need to vent a bit, but for those of you who have managed to stay clean, how did you get to where you are? What do you have in your life that makes being clean 'worth it?' And what advice can you give me for the next few days, while the physical cravings are at their worst? How do you deal with hopelessness and despair? I really don't want to fall off the wagon completely because I truly believe that will be the end of me. 

I've been given every opportunity to get my shit together. Therapy, rehab clinics, support groups, social workers, etc. My life is objectively quite good and yet I've squandered all of these blessings and have continually shot myself in the foot. So many people have it worse than me. I don't know why I still choose to be like this.

If you've read this far, thank you. I realise my story is not unique or even all that interesting but I would really appreciate some input. Sorry if this could have been worded better, it's difficult to collect my thoughts lately.",28

**Basic Text, p. 82**

&#x200B;

As newcomers, many of us came to our first  meeting with only a small spark of life remaining.¬† That spark, our  spirit, wants to survive.¬† Narcotics Anonymous nurtures that spirit.¬†  The love of the fellowship quickly fans that spark into a flame.¬† With  the Twelve Steps and the love of other recovering addicts, we begin to  blossom into that whole, vital human being our Higher Power intended us  to be.¬† We begin to enjoy life, finding purpose in our existence.¬† Each  day we choose to stay clean, our spirit is revitalized and our  relationship with our God grows.¬† Our spirit becomes stronger each day  we choose life by staying clean.

Despite the fact that our new life in recovery  is rewarding, the urge to use can sometimes be overwhelming.¬† When  everything in our lives seems to go wrong, a return to using can seem  like the only way out.¬† But we know what the consequence will be if we  use‚Äîthe loss of our carefully nurtured spirituality.¬† We have traveled  too far along the spiritual path to dishonor our spirit by using.¬†  Snuffing the spiritual flame we have worked so hard to restore in our  recovery is too dear a price to pay for getting high.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† I am grateful that my spirit is strong and vital.¬† Today, I will honor that spirit by staying clean.

I'm officially sober for longer than I've ever been sober for (aside from before I started drinking, obvi) - ""only"" by a day, but that's still a 24 hour period of time that I got through without drinking that I didn't manage to get through last time.

I am literally fighting back happy tears as I type this. I am finally starting to feel some level of hope that I can succeed this time, Universe willing. My life is finally starting to feel more like MINE and I am doing things I never in a million years thought I would be doing, making progress towards goals that I never thought would be possible to accomplish. I am not only alive, I'm beginning to THRIVE!!

I've made enough posts in this sub that have been about me seeking advice, complaining/venting, etc. and wanted to share something positive from my day. Thank you to anyone who has read this. I hope that you, too, find the peace I've found, if you haven't already.

It's hard thinking about how I'm going to keep ""recovery"" as a part of my life in the future. I struggle so much with most of the step-based meetings, I have yet to find one that works for me.

But no, my organs are 100% healthy and my doctor was shocked and told me that apparently not many people my age (I am 25) seem to survive alcolism around here (it's usually due to depression or mental illness. God rest their souls.) 

But I'm starting to see people for who they are and the realisation of how things are around me now with this pandemic. 

I asked a friend of mine for an opinion on how I was when I was drinking and she had told me that the 'other me' was actually quite terrifying and unaware of her motives and strength. I was told that I lack empathy for others and stop caring about anything or anyone, even stopped caring about myself and didn't seem to fear death when it involved myself or other's lives. Quite a unsettling thing to think about. 

I've had a couple of heavy challenges along the way and some which triggered my withdrawals and luckily I've managed to remove myself from those situations without giving up. I'm able to be around others who are drinking now and I have total self control. I'm just SO PROUD OF MYSELF.

We've both landed jobs in management. Myself being at a hotel and my spouse at a grocery store. Our income went from $0 a month to a combined $4,500 a month.

Last April I was working away from home and I took a few cans with me and a mix drink of j√§ger mixed with a energy drink. I ended up rationing my drinks because at the time I was underage to buy them. My rationing was 1 can every evening and a few mouth fills of the 50/50 j√§ger mix. 

Whilst working we would start at 7AM so when I had trouble waking up I would take a mouthful of the mix and go about my day.

This went on for a few days till I had no cans and dumped the mix drink because I didn‚Äôt want to get addicted.

After I got home a week later I worked the week without a problem, however after the weekend went I had 1/2 a bottle of vodka left and hid it under my bed. 

For the week I would take a shot at 6:45 am go to work and go home make a coffee add a shot and go out. I did this till mid may and got my shit together. 


Now I‚Äôve just gone to spending ¬£20-¬£30 on alcohol and drink the majority my self , I don‚Äôt have hangovers but last week I had the shakes after waking up around mid day.

Basic Text, p. 71



All things begin with a dream.¬† But how many of us fulfilled our dreams while using?¬† Even if we managed to complete something we had started, our addiction usually robbed us of any pride in our accomplishment.¬† Perhaps when we used, we dreamed of the day when we would be clean.¬† That day has come.¬† We can use this day to make our dreams come true.

To fulfill our dreams we must take action, but our lack of self-confidence may keep us from trying.¬† We can begin by setting realistic goals.¬† The success we experience when we attain our initial goals allows us to dream bigger dreams the next time around.

Some of our members share that when they compare the ambitions they had when they first got clean with what they have actually achieved in recovery, they are astounded.¬† In recovery, we often find more dreams come true than we could ever have imagined.


Just for today:¬† I will remember that all things begin with a dream.¬† Today, I will allow myself to make my dreams come true.

I‚Äôve been trying to push these feelings down the last year/ year & 1/2 or so but tonight it‚Äôs almost as if my soul is screaming to me ‚ÄúWake up!‚Äù. I‚Äôbe found myself another casualty of 2020 and the lockdowns. Before March 2020 I was involved in the recovery community. Going to NA meetings multiple times a week, had a great support system, bought my first new vehicle, and overall I felt like I was on the up and up. 

Over a year later‚Ä¶ I ended up moving states with my parents, have absolutely no friends or support system in a new city, I‚Äôm unemployed because I can‚Äôt seem to keep a job, and I‚Äôve been drinking for the last year in addition to picking up meth again in the last month because I moved to a border state and it‚Äôs even more of a problem than where I moved from! 

The final straw for me was after picking up some meth today, my connect threw in a couple ‚Äúdirty 30‚Äù fentanyl pills for free. I‚Äôve been a daily Kratom user for the past year but I‚Äôve never touched heroin or anything like that‚Ä¶ until tonight. I‚Äôm eternally grateful I was extremely safe and didn‚Äôt OD, but that was the last line I swore I would never cross, and I did. 

  I‚Äôm sick of living like this. I‚Äôm a 27m and I‚Äôve been addicted to altering my consciousness with whatever was available for 11+ years. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with BipolarII disorder 5 years ago which I think was brought on and is not helped in the slightest by my substance abuse. I feel broken physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially, and socially. There was definitely a small voice inside that was almost hoping I OD‚Äôd on the Fentanyl tonight. 

  So tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to my first NA meeting. I‚Äôve used up all my drugs and have no more alcohol left. I can‚Äôt keep living like this. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt want to die, but I don‚Äôt want to live either. I surrender. Im ready to hand my life back over to something greater than myself because clearly doing things my way has been an abject failure. 

I appreciate you if you‚Äôve made it this far. Thank you for allowing me to vent and to put these emotions and intention out into the universe. Cheers to sober days and new beginnings!",29

I'm coming up on making my first year clean off heroin/fentanyl, just 10 days to go. Problem is, for the first time since I got the news I'm about to get into, I'm actually thinking about going back out..... I'm not going to. I know I'll likely die if I do. I'm just fucking upset at the moment. So back in October, after some seriously odd behavior, we coaxed my dad into getting checked out. After some tests and a CT, they found a tumor on the left side of his brain. One successful surgery, several more tests, and a week or so later we get the news that he has glioblastoma brain cancer. For the uninitiated, it's the most aggressive brain cancer and is not yet curable. They gave him 2 years. He's a month shy of 53..... Moving on, targeted radiation, the first few rounds of chemo, and his optune therapy have all gone well, but the doctors say that these treatments only really hamper the development of the cancer. He hasn't been able to start round 4 of chemo because he's getting to where his body isn't able to keep up with the demand. He went in earlier this week for his regular testing and an MRI, and they've now found a new series of lesions on his frontal lobe... What does that mean? Not a damn clue other than nothing good. He's going back Tuesday for the follow up and to hopefully get a better idea of what he's up against at this point. I just...... Thought I was ready? Fuck, I don't know.... I had the urge to go grab a pack when he was first diagnosed, and fought it because he and my mom need me more than ever. Now the only thing really stopping me is the fact that I don't want him to have to bury me. That's all I got. Thanks to whoever reads this shit.",35

Not using at the moment, but not for lack of desire. I can't fucking find any. The fact that I'm saying this has caused me to finally admit and accept that I am in *dire* need of counseling and a recovery program. I reached out to a counselor who specializes in opioid dependence after realizing that even though I have already gone through a rehab program (2009-2012), I did not recover. I've relapsed several times. I use kratom daily. I'll add this about kratom: It's not a fucking cure for opioid dependence. Kratom acts on the mu-opioid receptors just the same as heroin does. All you've done is replace one type of agonist for another. That doesn't mean maintenance therapy isn't useful, it just means I do not believe kratom is medicine and should be considered a recreational drug exclusively and consequently, making the switch from heroin to kratom, while safer, is not real recovery. Which is sort of where I am right now. I use it daily, but lately it's not cutting it for me and the desire and urge to seek out and use heroin has gotten overwhelming. I have been white-knuckling it for weeks. I'm going to ask my psychiatrist to put me back on suboxone because I feel that a relapse is imminent. 

This all started up again after I heard song the *It's not living (if it's not with you)* which is a song about heroin addiction. I listen to it on repeat every day. All the time. Over and over. I think the writer of the song really summed it up well when he wrote:

- - -
*I feel sick and I know that I'll lose
but it's not living if it's not with you*
- - -
I just don't know what to do. I have turned into a person I cannot stand. I used to think I had some kind of dignity, you know, as a heroin addict. I had a drug of choice and nothing else would suffice. But since it's become difficult to find, I've become one of those ""anything I can get my hands on"" kind of addicts and I have never had respect for that kind of person. I don't know why that is, I've just always thought there was something inelegant about it, as if being addicted to heroin was accompanied by a modicum of elegance. But the difference is, after years of struggling and resisting and getting angry when people told me to seek counseling, I've finally admitted it. I admit it to myself. I need help. I did not recover the first time. I'm not okay. I want to recover. Hi everyone. I need support.",10

**Basic Text, p. 13**

&#x200B;

When we think of being desperate, we envision  an undesirable state: a poor, bedraggled soul frantically clawing at  something sorely needed, a desperate look in the eyes.¬† We think of  hunted animals, hungry children, and of ourselves before we found NA.

Yet it was the desperation we felt before  coming to NA that compelled us to accept the First Step.¬† We were fresh  out of ideas, and so became open to new ones.¬† Our insanity had finally  risen higher than our wall of denial, forcing us to get honest about our  disease.¬† Our best efforts at control had only worn us out; hence, we  became willing to surrender.¬† We had received the gift of desperation  and, as a result, were able to accept the spiritual principles that make  it possible for us to recover.

Desperation is what finally drives many of us  to ask for help.¬† Once we‚Äôve reached this state, we can turn around and  start anew.¬† Just as the desperate, hunted animal seeks a safe haven, so  do we: in Narcotics Anonymous.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† The gift of desperation  has helped me become honest, open-minded, and willing.¬† I am grateful  for this gift because it has made my recovery possible.

I'm at a standstill and I'm looking for a glimmer of hope as I'm feeling very hopeless right now.  I'm posting on behalf of my brother who has been struggling with alcohol addiction for many ,many years.  He has some personal demons that he has had to deal with and it's so hard to help him when I can barely help myself as I have my own family and responsibilities.  Yesterday on my father's birthday my brother was arrested because he was drinking and apparently was supposed to be watching his three-year-old son but he was found wandering the street by the neighbour who them called the cops.  He was detained by the cops and taken to the hospital.  His license has been suspended and I believe he has a criminal record now because of child negligence due to drinking.
 Him and his wife have been having many problems and he has left only to go back to her. We have told him countless times to just leave her but he still goes back despite our efforts to advise him otherwise. He says one moment that he can't stand her but the next he feels better and goes back because he misses the kids and it's downhill from there again, back to the bottle.  At this current moment he is taking anti-depressants as well and he cant drive and he says he won't go back to her.  Story is much longer and complicated.  I would like to know how I can help them because I don't want anything bad to happen to him.  Suicide etc.He says he's ready to start his new life but actions speak louder than words which he has yet to prove.  I'm just so angry ,embarrassed and upset at him about this whole situation and how it seems like he's dragging us his sisters and parents into this as well which is so unfair.Anyone in this group have advice I would really appreciate it.",2

I guess I just hoped that at this point I would feel better than I do. I still get sweaty at weird times, I still sneeze about a thousand times a day. Overall I‚Äôm fine, I know I would‚Äôve killed to feel like this two months ago. But I guess I had this image in my head that I was going to be riding high, feeling amazing by this point, and I don‚Äôt. Idk.

I‚Äôve also been having some cravings. My old DOC was oxy, then was on subs for 2.5 years. I feel like I‚Äôm just searching for anything that might make me feel ‚Äúgood.‚Äù I‚Äôve started drinking coffee, energy drinks, I‚Äôm eating more junk food. I‚Äôve been trying to give myself some grace and say ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what it takes to get through early sobriety, so be it.‚Äù I just find myself fantasizing about oxy, the good old days before I used it to dig myself a hole. I don‚Äôt even have access to it, but if someone offered me real pharma oxy right now I‚Äôm not sure I could turn it down. 

My life is going so well, and I know relapsing would fuck it up considerably. I have a new career that I really love. I have a beautiful family, a wedding in September, we‚Äôre about to buy a house, we want to try for another baby and I desperately want a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pregnancy where I don‚Äôt stress about the baby having sub withdrawals. I keep telling myself that if I just get through to September, we‚Äôll start trying for another baby then I‚Äôll have 9 months of guaranteed sobriety.

2021-07-17 12:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/om74zu/iop_ua_question/,IOP UA Question,"I attend an outpatient program and today have 4 months sober from alcohol. I am down to 2 groups a week, with breathalyzers and urinary analysis (UAs) both days. Last Tuesday morning I had my first full blown panic attack since my sobriety that I was unable to quell by non-medication methods. I‚Äôm no stranger to anxiety and I really did try everything but finally gave in and took about 0.15 mg of my doctor prescribed Xanax. I can go 2 years before using up a bottle of 30mg, so I definitely use it as PRN only and it is not my DOC, only alcohol was. Before my UA on Thursday, I told my therapist and the technician about my situation and they were fairly understanding. She did however say that they would have to wait for the results on Tuesday to see what the next steps are. She thinks the worst they would do is knock me back down to IOP3 (6 groups a week compared to my current 2). I told them when I first started about my anxiety and prescription and my infrequent usage and they told me to just let them know before a UA if I had used it.

So the question:

I‚Äôm not worried, anxious, nervous about the results or the outcome. It is not a threat to my sobriety. However, there is a little part of me that thinks I won‚Äôt accept the IOP3 verdict (or worse) if it comes to that. I‚Äôm there voluntarily and quite frankly am at about the timeframe to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù anyway even though I was thinking of staying a little longer (maybe 2 months) because I do enjoy it and recognize the benefits.

I see 5 possible outcomes:

Outcome 1 - UA results are below threshold and life continues.

Outcome 2 - Same as 1 but they drop me to IOP3 for admitting it and/or having some detectable level.

Outcome 3 - Same as 1 but they kick me out for 2 weeks as per procedure.

Outcome 4 - UA results are above threshold but they understand it is not my DOC and it‚Äôs prescribed, so they let me continue on just letting me know that it should not be a reoccurring thing and usage has to remain PRN or else they‚Äôll have to take action.

Outcome 5 - Same as 4 but they drop me to IOP3 or kick me out.

I‚Äôm obviously ok with Outcomes 1 & 4. 

Any Outcome where I‚Äôm ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù will probably result in me pleading my case a little, but not enough to lose sleep over. The main thing that would bug me is that other patients may see it as a failure and that it could affect their recovery, seeing another person ‚Äúsuccumb to relapse‚Äù, even though I don‚Äôt see it that way. And of course it would bug me a little too because like I said I do enjoy the program.

Any option where they demote me to IOP3 is where I see problems, especially if my UA is below the threshold. It‚Äôs not an ego thing or an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù thing, it‚Äôs that I may see it as a failure, as one would with any demotion. I know in my soul I didn‚Äôt relapse so it‚Äôs not a threat to my sobriety, but I want to leave this facility on a good note, not with a bad taste in my mouth.

Anyone have something similar happen to them, or any thoughts in general?

Thanks in advance.",4

The room is dark.¬† Your forehead is bathed  in cold sweat.¬† Your heart is racing.¬† You open your eyes, sure that  you‚Äôve just blown your clean time.¬† You‚Äôve had a ‚Äúusing dream,‚Äù and it  was just like being there‚Äîthe people, the places, the routine, the sick  feeling in your stomach, everything.¬† It takes a few moments to realize  it was just a nightmare, that it didn‚Äôt actually happen.¬† Slowly, you  settle down and return to sleep.

The next morning is the time to examine what  really happened the night before.¬† You didn‚Äôt use last night‚Äîbut how  close are you to using today?¬† Do you have any illusions about your  ability to control your using?¬† Do you know, without a doubt, what would  happen once you took the first drug?¬† What stands between you and a  real, live relapse?¬† How strong is your program?¬† Your relationships  with your sponsor, your home group, and your Higher Power?

Using dreams don‚Äôt necessarily indicate a  hole in our program; for a drug addict, there‚Äôs nothing more natural  than to dream of using drugs.¬† Some of us think of using dreams as gifts  from our Higher Power, vividly reminding us of the insanity of active  addiction and encouraging us to strengthen our recovery.¬† Seen in that  light, we can be grateful for using dreams.¬† Frightening as they are,  they can prove to be great blessings‚Äîif we use them to reinforce our  recovery.

Needing some encouragement or something. I know so many are probably in the same boat. This isn‚Äôt my first rodeo. 

I wish I could say I felt great and accomplished but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been to rehab, I‚Äôve been to detox. This time I went at it by moving out of state with 16 mg of subutex and 14 diazepam I still have 4 mg left but discontinued. 

However I expected to feel a lot better, I‚Äôve been here before. I should be grateful not to wake up in withdrawal figuring out how I‚Äôm going to cop $100 worth so I can make it through the day as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person. I know people out there who are hours or days in that would kill to be where I am. 

Tbh I would have killed for 30 days 32 days ago. I‚Äôve ran marathons, I‚Äôve held down 6 figure jobs, education blah blah blah. Ya know a tale as old as time. This shit is way harder. 

I feel like shit plain and simple. GI issues, depression, lack of energy are the worst. 

I want to get back to reality but I feel like I‚Äôm functioning at 25%. I got a job offer and turned it down because I just don‚Äôt feel like I can perform in a high stress sales role atm. 

I try to stay away from thinking about what led me here because I can‚Äôt change it. I gave everything Ive ever earned up for drugs. I was told I‚Äôd end up here but we have to learn for ourselves I guess. 

I‚Äôve excepted I‚Äôll never be the same person I once was but I‚Äôm also hopeful I‚Äôll see something worthwhile for the pain and misery I‚Äôve put myself and those who care about me through. 

I guess this is more of a rant than anything. I dont know where I‚Äôm going but I hope I‚Äôm on the right track. 

I have people where I moved to who are supportive but they can‚Äôt understand how someone could have the urge to put a needle in their arm after all I‚Äôve been through. Which is normal. I guess I just need to interact with someone who knows what it‚Äôs like. 

Thanks for reading my bs, to those out there going through it keep going. It‚Äôs a rough world out there. Unfortunately when your active addiction stops life doesn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs what is so damn hard.",29

&#x200B;

Somewhere along the way, many of us developed  strong feelings of inadequacy and inferiority.¬† Deep inside was a voice  that continually cried out, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worthless!‚Äù¬† Many of us learn to  recognize this characteristic of low self-esteem very early in our  recovery.¬† Some of us may feel that our feelings of inferiority were  where all our problems began.

Whether we learn this low self-esteem in our  families or through our interactions with others, in NA we learn the  tools for reclaiming ourselves.¬† Building up our fractured self-esteem  sometimes begins by simply accepting a service position. ¬†Or perhaps our  phone begins to ring, and for the first time people are calling just to  see how we are.¬† They don‚Äôt want anything from us but to reach out and  help.

Next we get a sponsor, someone who teaches us  that we are worthwhile and believes in us until we can believe in  ourselves.¬† Our sponsor guides us through the Twelve Steps where we  learn who we really are, not who we have built ourselves up or down to  be.

Low self-esteem doesn‚Äôt go away overnight.¬†  Sometimes it takes years for us to really get in touch with ourselves.¬†  But with the help of other members of NA who share our same feelings,  and by working the Twelve Steps, we blossom into individuals whom others  and, most importantly, we ourselves respect.

All human beings struggle with  self-centeredness.¬† The chronic self-centeredness that lies at the very  core of addiction makes that struggle doubly difficult for people like  us.¬† Many of us have lived as if we believed we were the last people on  earth, utterly blind to the effect our behavior has had on those around  us.

The Eighth Step is the process our program has  given us to honestly examine our past relationships.¬† We take a look at  the writing we did on our Fourth Step to identify the effects our  actions had on the people in our lives.¬† When we recognize harm done to  some of those people, we become willing to take responsibility for our  actions by making amends to them.

The variety of people we encounter in our day  and the quality of our relations with them determines, to a great  extent, the quality of our very lives.¬†Love, humor, excitement,  caring‚Äîthe things that make life worth living derive much of their  meaning from being shared with others.¬† Understanding this, we want to  discover the true nature of our relationships with other people and mend  whatever breaks we may find in those relations.¬† We want to work the  Eighth Step.

I have been an addict for 5 years starting when I was 19. In Those 5 years I have about 3 years of recovery with 6 relapses in between. My addiction being mainly to oxycodone. The first time I seriously got clean was may 2018 and stayed clean until January 2020. In that time I was doing therapy and suboxone maintenance and that was pretty much it. But it was the first time I came clean to my family and girlfriend and felt like myself in years. My girlfriend and I got engaged in may 2019 and everything was going well. That summer, my sub doc closed his practice and I decided to wean myself off, I also stopped going to therapy thinking I was okay now. Soon after that I got in a bad car accident where I wasn‚Äôt injured or anything but I got extreme PTSD from driving at night. I also get depressed around the holidays from family issues so all of this was a perfect storm in which I thought using one time would be okay and it turned into a two month bender. I decided enough was enough and got clean again March 2020 and have been since. I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© since high school, 7 years now, and she‚Äôs always been supportive. But for some reason I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell her. Since I‚Äôve been clean I‚Äôve learned from my experiences, I take a small dose of subs daily, I have weekly therapy, I do NA, I‚Äôve cut out all marijuana and drinking, and still expanding my resources. The only thing that was left was to come clean about my relapse. I told her a little over a week ago and she took it hard. She‚Äôs always told me it‚Äôs the lying about it that she hates the most. I can‚Äôt think of how I was able to lie to her for over a year, in my head I was just thinking of the perfect time to tell her and it just kept getting pushed off for that ‚Äúperfect time‚Äù. We have always had good communication and have never broken up ever. Right now she is rethinking our relationship because she can‚Äôt be with someone who can lie to her for over a year. To me it feels like my last chance to fix things and get it right.

 Why did I feel the need to hide this from her? She is a very supportive partner the only think I can think of is I was afraid to lose her. Can anyone relate or help with ways to be more honest or more ways to ensure I stay sober?",3

One of the first things that happens to many  of us in recovery is that we start to look better.¬† We get healthier;  we bathe; we dress more appropriately.¬† And without the goading of  active addiction, many of us finally stop stealing, lying, and  hustling.¬† We start to look¬†*normal*‚Äîjust by removing the drugs.

I'm filled with anxiety fearing about what my almost ex husband is gonna have to say about it once it gets out that I'm pregnant. I'm fighting hard to not relapse and take a opiate. I already suffer from medical conditions that make me hurt constantly on a daily basis and now with me being pregnant and knowing that I won't be able to have any kind of narcotics to help ease my pain during pregnancy and not to mention the pain from delivery. I already know that I'm gonna have to have a cesarean delivery bc my other children were born via c section. That's the part that's really daunting to me. But I'm hoping between now and then I'll be strong enough to not even think about wanting it when the time comes for delivery. Any words of encouragement or wisdom would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in advance and if I posted anything wrong or out of community guidelines please lmk. Thanks and y'all have a great day!! ü•∞üòò,52

That urge to find the quickest means possible to escape my feelings, my discomfort, has been chased away by patience, waiting to see what comes from being cracked open, vulnerable, ready, willing.

Would just like to let everyone know I made it, I‚Äôm feeling amazing. Went to an out patient treatment organisation who were amazing! Got straight into good habits (diet, exercise, therapy etc.) as soon as I had kicked everything beside benzos.

After 6 years of everyday abuse of multiple drugs I am now feeling good again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still have the odd bad day. But overall, I feel so much more happy with my life. 

I remember I used to just submit to the fact that I would probably die a drug addict, I had no hope. If you are struggling, just know you can do it too. If you really want to get clean, you can do it. It‚Äôs scary as fuck, but once you do it, you‚Äôll never ever look back.",18

**Basic Text, p. 99**

&#x200B;

Many of us have watched as babies take their  first steps.¬† The mother holds the child on its feet.¬† The father kneels  nearby with outstretched arms, encouraging the little one, his face  flooded with devotion.¬† The baby takes a few small steps toward its  father.¬† An older brother and sister cheer the tyke on.¬† Baby falls  down.¬† Its mother, murmuring words of comfort, picks the child up and  starts over again.¬† This time, baby stays up until it is close enough to  fall into the safety of its father‚Äôs arms.

As newcomers, we arrive in the rooms of NA much  like this small child.¬† Accustomed to living a life crippled by  addiction, full of fear and uncertainty, we need help to stand.¬† Just  like a child beginning its march toward adulthood, we take our halting  first steps toward recovery.¬† We learn to live this new way of life  because others who have gone before us encourage and comfort us by  telling us what worked‚Äîand what didn‚Äôt work‚Äîfor them.¬† Our sponsor is  there for us when we need a push in the right direction.

Many times we feel like we can‚Äôt take another  step in recovery.¬† Just like a child learning to walk, we sometimes  stumble or fall.¬† But our Higher Power always awaits us with  outstretched arms.¬† And like the child‚Äôs brothers and sisters shouting  their encouragement, we, too, are supported by other NA members as we  walk toward a full life in recovery.

I‚Äôve racked up $2,000 in credit card debt which I‚Äôm going to pay off next month.

I also started smoking, which I haven‚Äôt done for over a year. Same with binge eating. I used to be addicted to coke, but turned my life around.

Since then, I‚Äôve had three promotions in one year. My life has never been better. I used to be overdosing in hospitals, a slave to my addiction and desires for over a decade.

Last night, a friend invited me to a mansion party. Going into this, I was strong in my faith being around people who might be doing drugs.

We arrive to the party, someone immediately offers me molly. I decline, zero temptation. Before I went to the party, I took something called NAC that can be bought in the health store. It provides strong mental clarity and is good for the brain. One of the side effects is strong awareness/mental clarity.

I was only drinking water at the party, and I forgot I took NAC (it‚Äôs not a drug, I take it because it helps regulate my OCD). I suddenly start feeling that strong awareness, which made me think someone might have slipped MDMA in my drink.

30 minutes go by and the friend I was with ends up buying MDMA. I let him know beforehand how I was feeling about my strong sense of awareness, and that I thought I might have been drugged.

Ten minutes later, my mind went, ‚Äúwell if I‚Äôm already feeling something why don‚Äôt I just take some MDMA?‚Äù My friend, who knows about the problems I had in the past, swallows his pill and says that it would be a horrible idea. He tells me to imagine how I‚Äôd feel ten minutes later, or the next day. How much I‚Äôve accomplished being sober and how I‚Äôd lose it all again.

I explained to him that it would be a one time thing, how we‚Äôre at an insane party - I was just trying to justify the reasoning to him. I came to my senses a moment later, then I went downstairs and prayed to God, thanking Him for not giving into the whim of my desires.

I went back upstairs and saw a bunch of people snorting a bunch of coke. One guy was completely fucked up on mushrooms. I decided to go home and buy a pizza and read instead.

I was so confident in my sobriety. If I didn‚Äôt take NAC I‚Äôm very certain that desire wouldn‚Äôt have happened under those circumstances. This post would have been entirely different if I did drugs. I‚Äôll talk to my therapist about this.",81

It was a strange experience. I haven‚Äôt gone back to NA after I hit 6 months sober in 2018. After that last meeting I kind of lost myself and lost my sobriety. I was able to gain sobriety last year and I am currently sober from everything. I have been feeling vulnerable to myself as of late, so I decided to take a leap and try a meeting.

It reminded me of all of my time in NA prior. Going to meetings high, being reluctant to go or even get sober, but then again I was able to get clean. 

I‚Äôve been clean from painkillers and H for 3 years now, but my other addiction has been around 1 year.

The meeting was going good, until I was reminded of why I stopped. I completed up to step 5 but I just stopped. Here is why - I don‚Äôt agree with the steps. This is a little controversial I guess, but I don‚Äôt agree with the idea of a ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù and what not. I found myself along the way, along the journey of being sober. 

My new beliefs have brought me peace within myself and made me become okay with what has happened to me and what my life is going to look like in the future.

**Basic Text, p. 137**

&#x200B;

A negative attitude is the trademark of active addiction.¬† Everything that occurred in our lives was someone or something else‚Äôs fault.¬† We had blaming others for our shortcomings down to a fine science.¬† In recovery, one of the first things we strive to develop is a new attitude.¬† We find that life goes a lot easier when we replace our negative thinking with positive principles.

While a negative attitude dogged us in our active addiction, all too often it can follow us into the rooms of  Narcotics Anonymous.¬† How can we begin to adjust our attitudes?¬† By altering our actions.¬† It isn‚Äôt easy, but it can be done.

We can start by listening to the way we talk.¬† Before we open our mouths, we ask ourselves some simple  questions:¬† Does what I‚Äôm going to say speak to the problem, or the solution?¬† Is what I‚Äôm going to say framed in a kind manner?¬† Is what I  have to say important, or would everyone be just as well off if I kept my mouth shut?¬† Am I talking just to hear myself talk, or is there some  purpose to my ‚Äúwords of wisdom‚Äù?

Our attitudes are expressed in our actions.¬†  Often, it‚Äôs not what we say, but the way we say it, that really matters.¬† As we learn to speak in a more positive manner, we will notice our attitudes improving as well.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† I want to be free of negativity.¬† Today, I will speak and act positively.

From time to time, we hear speakers share that they don‚Äôt really understand spiritual principles yet.¬† They tell us that if we knew what went on in their minds, we‚Äôd be amazed at how insane they still are.¬† They tell us that the longer they‚Äôre clean, the less they know about anything.¬† In the next breath, these same speakers tell us about the profound changes recovery has made in their lives.¬†  They have moved from complete despair to unfailing hope, from uncontrollable drug use to total abstinence, from chronic unmanageability to responsibility through working the Twelve Steps of  Narcotics Anonymous.¬† Which story is true?¬† Do we or don‚Äôt we recover?

We may think we demonstrate humility or gratitude by underplaying the change that recovery has brought to our lives.¬† True, we do injustice to the program when we take credit for this miracle ourselves.¬† But we do an equal injustice‚Äîto ourselves and to those we share with‚Äîwhen we don‚Äôt acknowledge this miracle‚Äôs magnitude.

*We do recover.*¬† If we have trouble seeing the miracle of recovery, we‚Äôd better look again.¬† Recovery is alive and at work in Narcotics Anonymous‚Äîin our oldtimers, in the newcomers flooding our meetings, and most of all in ourselves.¬† All we have to do is open our eyes.

I'm 5 months pregnant and for the last few weeks or more, things have felt ""off"". He was working a lot more, not seeming like himself, sleeping a lot. We haven't been going to meetings. He kept assuring me everything was great, I didn't believe him but tried not to push the matter. The other night we're lying in bed and I happened to look over at his phone as he was shooting off a speedy text to a friend and closing it right away, which was unlike him and suspicious. But, the text (I'm a speed reader and saw it anyway) also sounded like a drug deal ""make sure we can get scooby snacks tomorrow, I'll pay"". So I tell him he needs to explain what that was about. He hesitates and tells me it's ""just testosterone"". I kind of freak out because, for one, my ex didn't start being abusive until he started testosterone. But also, you're an ex IV drug user and you don't see anything problematic about taking up a new injectable habit?!? 
He says he feels terrible, he's not going to do it anymore, it was only two times in as many weeks, he knows it was a bad idea. And he swears that's all it is, nothing else, ""he'd never lie to me"". 

Well, this convo doesn't sit right with me. I can't shake this nagging feeling that he's still lying. None of it adds up. He goes to take a shower the next day and something goes off in my brain and says ""go check his truck, you're never in there, he always insists on taking your car"". So i do, and his center console is full of empty kratom vials. I put one on the table with a note that says ""have a great day :)"" and go to work so I can calm down. 

He texts me how sorry he is, how he's been struggling, he's been using this for ""a month or so"", again he promises that's all it is, and he wants to recommit to recovery. He went to a meeting with his sponsor, and while he's feeling like garbage physically he says he's ""feeling better already"" emotionally (it's been like 2 days but ok)

I still don't feel like I'm getting the truth, but I know there's nothing I can do about that now. Does it even matter? I just can't help feeling hurt, angry, and a little bit like it's my fault. Maybe if I weren't so difficult lately, it wouldn't have come to this. Why can't he just trust me enough to talk to me? Why would he mess around with things that can easily lead back to his DOC when I'm pregnant? I've talked to my sponsor and decided to just work on my own recovery so I can be prepared no matter which way things go, but I still want to be there for him to help him get back on the right path. But what's the best way to do that? How can I be supportive while my paranoia and insecurities are on overdrive now?",17

I‚Äôve been getting bad with my mental health and recently yelled at her under the influence of alcohol. I have bad childhood experiences with getting angry and throwing things/yelling at my dad for being drunk and getting mad at me all the time for not talking to him when I would get home from school. It has scared me for life. 

Beer has been my go to choice of alcohol, but I enjoy it. I hate when i mix it with liquor because that‚Äôs when things reallllyyy go downhill and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why. 

My girlfriend broke up with me today because I was out with my dealer doing coke. I‚Äôve had this problem since the tornado happened in Nashville that I was a part of. I moved away because it was toxic and so I moved where my girlfriend was in Kansas, but then I knew people who sold it and it got me into trouble multiple times. I didn‚Äôt have the money for it but I‚Äôd do it anyway. This happened for a couple months till I finally started getting my shit together, but then my job started being super shitty and I hated going in and so I would go buy some and drink on the job multiple times and even between my shifts. My girlfriend hated that I would come home and she knew I was either coked out or had been drinking. I saw this as a problem because I emotionally hurt her and I hated that because then I wouldn‚Äôt remember anything I said the next day (I would remember some but not a lot). 

So let‚Äôs move forward a couple months, March of 2021, I moved to Denver and now I‚Äôm surrounded by people who do this shit all the time and I‚Äôm trying so hard to get out of this habit for myself now. I don‚Äôt want to be this angry person who yells when they‚Äôre drunk or spends their money on pointless shit like drugs. I‚Äôm just over it and I don‚Äôt know where to go at this point. My girlfriend (now ex) thinks I haven‚Äôt changed from last year (I did coke everyday after the tornado by myself till 4am most nights). Whereas now I‚Äôm not doing it by myself and it‚Äôs usually when my friends ask if I know where to get it. I‚Äôm wondering if i should set my boundaries straight. I have no clue what to do and I‚Äôm sorry this was all over the place. Any advice helps. If you need more backstory I‚Äôll more than happily tell you as well.",20

**Basic Text, p. 52**

&#x200B;

We‚Äôve heard it said that we often see God most clearly in one another.¬† We see the truth of this when we practice our  Twelfth Step.¬† When we carry the recovery message to another addict, we  sense the presence of a Power greater than ourselves.¬† And as we watch  the message take hold, we realize something else:¬† It‚Äôs the message that  brings recovery, not the messenger.¬† A Higher Power, not our own power,  is the source of the change that begins when we carry the message to a  still-suffering addict.

As the message does its work, transforming the  life of another addict, we see a Higher Power in action.¬† We watch as  acceptance and hope replace denial and despair. ¬†Before our very eyes,  the first traces of honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness begin to  appear.¬† Something‚Äôs happening inside this person, something bigger and  more powerful than either of us.¬† We‚Äôre watching the God we‚Äôve come to  understand at work in someone‚Äôs life.¬† We see the Higher Power in them.¬†  And we know with greater certainty than ever that this Higher Power is  in us, too, as the force driving our recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† As I carry the message of recovery to other addicts, I will try to pay attention to the Power behind the message.¬† Today, as I watch other addicts recover, I will try to recognize the God in them so I can better recognize the God in myself.

To sum things up, he got me addicted to pain meds. I have a legitimate disease that causes chronic pain, and before I was diagnosed I‚Äôd get these unbearable headaches and nothing helped. I‚Äôd lay in bed in pain and one day, me ex asked if I wanted one of his Percocets. I said sure. I didn‚Äôt know why he had them but I didn‚Äôt ask any questions. I took it and found relief for once. 

I went to my Dr. and asked for more tests and a prescription. I had an MRI done and they found I had a condition called Chiari Malformation. Basically my brain was falling down my spinal column so my spinal fluid wasn‚Äôt flowing properly causing horrible pressure headaches. 

As time went on, I managed my pain with the meds, but also developed a tolerance to them. When I‚Äôd run out, I‚Äôd ask my ex for some. He ALWAYS HAD THEM. It got to a point where my ex called them ‚Äúbargaining chips‚Äù meaning he‚Äôd give me meds if I promised to ‚Äúput out‚Äù or ‚Äúhook him up‚Äùwith a blow job or let him film us. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with any of it. I felt like a damn druggie prostitute, which I guess technically I was at that point. It was out of control. This went on for about 3 years. I lost all respect for him but mostly for myself. I felt used. I felt dirty. I felt taken advantage of. I was so completely lost in addiction. 

At the time, I‚Äôd been ‚Äúsober‚Äù or not-drinking for a long time. He knew when we got married that I‚Äôd struggled with alcohol in the past, but I promised to quit, and I did for six years. I had a few relapses in there which never lasted long. I‚Äôm not pointing fingers here, I just want to be very clear that I made the choices I did and take full responsibility for them all, but I should have ran the second he offered me a Percocet. 

God what I would give to go back. 

I eventually was referred to a neurologist that specialized in my condition. He felt that surgery would be a good option at this point since no amount of meds were helping and I just wanted the pain to stop, so I scheduled the surgery for mid April 2018. 

On April 1st 2018 it was Easter. I had a headache and didn‚Äôt have any meds left, and my ex wasn‚Äôt going to give me any either. He‚Äôd give them to me at night so that I‚Äôd feel better, for him. We were going to go to my parents for Easter. I needed SOMETHING.

On my way to Circle K I remember thinking that this was a horrible idea. I‚Äôd talked myself into buying a couple shots of Fireball. Well, apparently that day, they had a pack of 10 shots for really cheap according to the cashier. ‚ÄúFuck. Okay then.‚Äù I thought. I was nervous about my upcoming brain surgery, as well. Alcohol should fix that too, right?

To preface the next part of my story, I want to reiterate that I made these choices, no one to blame but myself. I will own that forever, all day, for the rest of my life. 

I‚Äôm the true poster child for an alcoholic. As they say 1 is too much but 1,000 is never enough. 

After sneaking in about 4 shots of Fireball we were driving to my parents house. My ex got suspicious that I was drinking then got mad. I hadn‚Äôt drank in a long time so it took him by surprise. We got into a fight. Then when we got to my parents house my dad started screaming at me. We were by the pool. What I remember is very vague because somewhere between arriving at my parents and getting into an argument with my dad, I‚Äôd snuck off into the bathroom to take more shots. 

From what remember, my dad was screaming at me, upset and I yelled at him to shut the fuck up, he then told me to just kill myself and get it over with already then pushed me into the pool. 

This was not just my imagination, this actually happened according to my mom. My dad and I have have never had a good relationship, as he too is an alcoholic. This was also the 3rd time he‚Äôd told me to just kill myself already. 

That is neither here nor there but it is probably why I did what I did.

I ran upstairs soaking wet, crying, cold, and upset. I just wanted to die! Right then I wanted it over with! I smashed my parents bedroom window with my elbows and attempted to jump out. For visualization, it was an upstairs bedroom, not very far from where I‚Äôd hope to end it all. Us drunks are very dramatic at times. But my mom stopped me, pulling me out of the window with the help of my brother.

Police were called I was taken to the hospital, I got stitched up, and waited for what was next. All I could think about was my kids. Even writing this now makes me sob thinking of them. Thinking of the trauma I put them through. I can never undo that or take that pain away. Thinking of all the time I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and all the time I‚Äôd spent waiting for more pills. I will never get that time back, and I will never be able to take back the horrendous event that took place April 1st 2018.

On April 3rd, a day before our 9 year anniversary I got served divorce papers. I had CPS called on me. I was forbidden to see my kids unless he was there at all times. Not by the court, by him. I did as he said, never argued, I felt so completely ashamed and completely heart-broken. 

Fast forward, divorce was finalized, I sobered up for some time, but I was reeling still from all of it. There‚Äôs so much more to this story but I felt so compelled to write this. 

I guess post-divorce post-surgery is an entirely different post which I may save for later. But now, I‚Äôm in the best place I‚Äôve ever been mentally, emotionally, and Spiritually. So much good has come out of so much bad. Yes I‚Äôm still angry with my ex. But what‚Äôs come out of this for me is complete wholesome humility. The relationship with my dad is, well we just don‚Äôt talk about it, but we‚Äôre doing okay. My relationship with my kids is what matters most though. I am an open book to them. We have a very special bond now, and are closer than ever. As they grow older I plan on diligently educating them on the disease of addiction. I will always be there for them, no matter what. ‚ù§Ô∏è",20

Drank myself to sleep for about 8 consecutive years. I'm 26 y/o and 7 months into sobriety. I genuinely believe I killed off a significant amount of brain cells and the damage may be irreparable. I have a terrible time concentrating, focusing, learning. When I watch a show or movie, read an article or book, have simple conversation or interactions, drive somewhere, I will remember next to nothing. I'm more insecure than ever because of this. 

Prior to my drug abuse, show me how to do something one time, I'll remember it forever. Now it's the opposite. I'm trying to study for certifications (I work in IT) and failing as I can't recall the information I literally just consumed. I want to meet new people, make some new friends but I can't remember simple conversations. I've always struggled with attention deficit issues, but I was also a straight A student up through high school.

I know I messed my brain up with drugs. Now I'm trying to fix it but it seems impossible. From articles I've read, some of the damage, if not most, is permanent. With that being said, what's the point? I'll be a shell of who I once was forever. 

I recently started counseling again. My counselor thinks I have ADD (NOT ADHD, I am not hyper. Quite the opposite). Based on my symptoms, I think she may be right. Though, I don't see any doctor prescribing me medication for it at my age. I feel as if that is something you're suppose to grow out of. However, I do know a couple of adults still prescribed from childhood.

I got off a 12 hour shift at a fast food place and the plan was to go to a friends house and watch UFC. I get there to them sayings we‚Äôre going to sneak into a rave. We do with a handle of jack Daniels in my backpack. I feel uncomfortable there. Anxiety from the idea of being kicked out, seeing everyone that‚Äôs acting crazy because of the drugs they‚Äôre on, it‚Äôs eating me alive. I decided that I wasn‚Äôt going to drink. I was the one walking around with the bottle so fuck it. I‚Äôm getting shitfaced. 2 hours later we‚Äôre doing lines of cocaine off an iPhone in a tent. Another person enters with a bag of some mdma (crystals I know nothing about it I haven‚Äôt researched it. Sry if it‚Äôs wrong) they all snort that but not me.

Since then a lot of you were right. My husband didn't divorce me. We did talk about legal separation which is easily overturned if I continued to use. When he got back from my brothers funeral, he did not allow me to be with my daughter while he worked. But over time with clean drug tests I am now taking care of her while he works. He still has anxiety about it.

I contacted the program I was in and found out there's only ONE counselor for the entire Drug and Alcohol treatment patients. Which is why my counselor keeps changing and I  can't get ahold of anyone. I'm working with my PCP who I get my suboxone from.

For now a lot of things are up in the air. I confessed to my husband that I did seek out more drugs in our apartment complex while he and my daughter were at my brothers funeral. That's what I was mostly embarrassed about. Wen live in low income housing so it's not hard to find. We're gonna try to move soon. Also no contact with my mom. I'm not gonna think about her and what our future holds. My daughter comes first.

I want to thank all of you guys that replied. Even though I did go back out and use, I ended up reading all your comments once the drugs wore off.

I am Canadian. Some acronyms are:
NB= New Brunswick (province on East Coast - above Maine )
AB= Alberta (province in the west - Above Montana) 
DTC=Disability tax credit 

So this is my story. I never thought to tell it because I didn't think anyone would be interested. 
.
So we were living in Fredericton, NB and struggling big time. We had to move into a long term stay motel at $850/month. The only good thing about it was the location. And it included power, internet, and cable. It was *really* difficult to save for a place and pay for the motel each month. 

We eventually got a three bedroom mobile home. The location was out of the way and it was more like a two bedroom since one room had possible mold and we didn't use it for anything other than storage. Bills were roughly:

$850 / month rent
$150 / month power
$150 / month power 
$300-$500 / month groceries 
$50/month diapers 
$50/month formula 

And then to top it all I was an opiate addict. Probably $100/day. I don't even know how I afforded that but an addict always finds a way. 

Anyways, we couldn't keep living in a billingual province while only speaking one language. There was no job opportunities for us. We could never advance. 

So how did we save up money to move? We didn't. We filed for my son's child DTC and that was enough money from the backpay to buy a ford escape for 7k cash and move out west. Backpay was roughly $26k. 

When I moved here I got a job immediately. That was important to me so I could claim moving expenses at tax time. I ended up having 13k to claim with 8k rolling over into 2020 tax season. 

So my first job was at Slim Morton's. I didn't like it at all. Zero training and extremely busy. I had anxiety everyday before work. Wanted to quit so many times. Once I learned soup and sandwich I really wanted to quit. They only put one person in SS meanwhile you have drive thru and inside orders. The drive thru takes priority so you have guests standing there watching you actively avoid making their order. Plus they use real dishes and it slows the process down for indoors. 

Anyways. I couldn't stay there. My man got a good job trucking and all was well. Without getting off track I will just say he lost his job due to my ex friends making up lies and getting him fired even though he was our only income source. I will save that story for the comment section if anyone shows interest. 

Anyways, then covid happened. We got lucky that we qualified for the Canada emergency response benefit and we took advantage of that. 

So I recently got hired at a great job. And things are looking up as they have been for the past year. 

We purchased 100 chicks at the start of the pandemic. We sold the males for meat and kept the females for chickens. WE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. we've been expanding every chance we get. We expanded to turkeys this year. 

We sell our eggs for $3/dozen (for comparison they sell for $3-7 here) We sell our chickens for $15 not dressed or $20 dressed. 

Our turkeys we will sell for $20-$30 depending on competition and interest. We have a lot of them spoken for so we are looking into getting more. They are so so much fun. I highly recommend them. They are dumb as nails but the entertainment value alone is worth it. We had three accidentally commit suicide. As I said they aren't smart. 

Our breakdown is as follows: 

$1200 rent for a 3bedroom acreage on 160 acres. 
$150 power per month 
$150 heat per month 
$400 cigarettes I know üòí
$250 weed I replaced all my addictions and only smoke cannabis
$750 groceries for a family of 4 
$50 fast food
$300-500 to savings 
$300 farm supplies including feed and seeds 

I make roughly $19/hr at my full-time job and I make $18/hr at my part time job. I also just took my SellSafe to get a third job at a dispensary. 

My fiance is making a killing with the farm stuff. We want to buy a semi truck down the road and have him haul his own loads. For now though it's keeping him busy. 

We are currently saving for our wedding, a second vehicle, and a down payment on a house. Keeping an eye on used semi trucks for sale. 

We are actively working on fixing our credit. Joined a few groups on fbook like road to 750 and just took their advice. We waited for anything really bad to fall off our credit report - like I have a repo from age 18 on there (^thanks drugs) and that finally fell off. I hope after two years or good employment history I will qualify for a mortgage. 

I may or may not get a huge promotion. We are in the midst of negotiations. If I do - I will be making double what I was bringing home and get good benefits. It feels good to be recognized for my hard work. 

Also - my friend and I are opening our own non profit in Canada and the USA. It's going to focus on helping woman in recovery. We currently run an all woman's addiction support group on Facebook's and we have 23k members. This Reddit account is new and it's us expanding into other social media. We just completed the research and funding stage and are now starting the paperwork process. 

Tldr: I was an addict and struggling. Now I am in recovery and doing better.

Edit to add: I forgot fuel and insurance. My vehicle insurance is $120/month. We spend about $400-$600 on fuel because we do a lot of driving. We collect points and bonuses by paying for gas with our C.C. and using our points card with it. 

Car maintenance wise we do our scheduled oil changes ourselves, ask my dad to fix any major problems, buy the parts ourselves and just pay for labor in the shop if we absolutely must and then also buy a set of winter studded snow tires and swap those out each spring fall because the winters are tretcherous here. 

Also didn't include our C.C payment which can range from $50-$1100. We only use the card to get bonuses and rebuild credit. We pay the card off completely each month after it reports to the credit card company.",2

I managed to get clean of the weed(1 month) and that has already yielded some positive results. But i cannot shake my prescription drug abuse, mostly ambien.

I  always take it, do shit on it, regret it, not take it for a week, and then fall back into it.

I can't ask for help as those around me would judge but I don't believe would seriously help me.

As a consequence my health has deteriorated(weight gain and juul abuse), my sleep schedule is a mess, and my productivity is virtually gone.

How can I go about getting better on my own?

I've been told I have everything from OCD, BPD, ASD, MDD, and ADHD... lots of different letters. I don't know what I really am. I think I'm just a human being that's always been seeking connection and have found that in drugs. But the drugs don't work anymore and it hasn't been sustainable at all in years. In fact, I've burned my life down many many times. I've done about 3-4 years between in patient rehabs and jail. I got deported. The consequences have been endless.

I really lost myself worst of all. My spirit has been crushed by the continuous relapsing. I have two weeks clean again off heroin/meth, and am doing everything in my power to try and really start recovering again. It's been a while since I really tried to be in 'recovery' as opposed to just surviving not using drugs. I wanted to make this post because I have very little support in the real world. All my closest friends have died and I don't really have anyone I can talk to anymore. I did just start going back to NA, and also doing a group 3 days a week, among countless other strategies I'm using to try and keep myself grounded and in a recovery-oriented focus. 

Anyways, much love to everyone who is fighting the good fight and for those who inspire me to get another day clean. If anyone wants to stay in contact so we can help eachother out in these early days that would be dope. I'm really motivated to make sure my last relapse is the last.

How do we pray?¬† For each NA member, this is  a deeply personal matter.¬† Many of us find that, over time, we develop a  manner of prayer and meditation based on what we learn from others and  what we are comfortable with.

Some of us arrive in NA with a closed mind  toward a Power greater than ourselves.¬† But when we sit down with our  sponsor and discuss our difficulty, looking at the Second Step in depth,  we are pleased to find that we can choose any concept of a Higher Power  that appeals to us.

Just as our definition of a Power greater  than ourselves differs from addict to addict, so does our manner of  achieving a ‚Äúconscious contact.‚Äù¬† Some attend religious services; some  chant; some sit quietly or talk with whatever is out there; some find a  spiritual connection by communing with nature.¬† The ‚Äúright way‚Äù to pray  and meditate is whatever way helps us improve our conscious contact with  our own Higher Power.

Asking others how they found their spiritual  guidance is always a good place to begin.¬† Reading literature before we  enter periods of meditation can also help us.¬† Many have gone before us  on this search.¬† As we seek spiritual growth, we can greatly benefit  from their experience.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**¬† I will explore my options for improving my conscious contact with the God of my understanding.

The woman who gave me my food was vibrant, quick on her feet, friendly, and engaging. She looks to be young, in her 20's/30's. A couple days ago, I went through the drive through and hardly recognized her. Dark circles under her eyes, severe acne, gaunt, moved and responded slow. Her eyes looked so empty. I don't have a ton of experience around people using drugs, but she was on something. Saw her again yesterday at the drive through and same story. Even my husband noticed and commented that she seemed to be on drugs so it wasn't just me.

Anyway, this girl was so vibrant! Ready to take charge, a very bright light. So I guess I am asking you all if there was something someone did that helped you get to the path of recovery, even if just a little thing? She doesn't even know me and I don't know why I care so much about her but it was so sad. I have figured out which is her car (she's the only military gal there and her tattoos match her car decals), and I want to leave an encouraging note or something, or even a little gift like a gift card or an encouraging book or something? Maybe this is all very misguided, but I figured maybe you all have some inspiration for what encouraged you, even if it did nothing but nudge you? To be clear, I'm not trying to be Superwoman thinking I can save her. My thought was just maybe it is helpful to encourage someone? I wouldn't bring up that I think she's on drugs, more like telling her what a bright light I think she is. Thank you in advance! I appreciate and am grateful for your insight.",3

I lost 60 pounds in the first 2-3 months of my addiction, got into a car accident (only myself was injured), was arrested, went to rehab, was sober for 2 1/2 months, during this time i lived in dallas but was relocating back to houston, where I knew my sobriety was gonna take a turn for the worse. which it did. i visited houston for a weekend before i moved and caved. Once i moved to houston I was off of my DOC for around a month up until the beginning of this week. I had a friend who knew of my addiction history but asked me to take 1k xanax across town to her boyfriend. they assured me it was all accounted for and not to take any from it. But i didn‚Äôt care, i took about 25 off the top and they didn‚Äôt know. in the course of a week i managed to lose my job since I overslept 2 days in a row. Ruined my new car, and on thursday. I died. I had a sharp pain in my left leg that woke me up at 4 am, so bad that I was crying. I‚Äôm 18 so i still live at home and went to my moms room and she said just to take a shower. I dosed 2 Perc 10‚Äôs (only having taken 2, ever the day before) and about 2 hour after that i smoked, popped a bar. then i realized i was way too messed up. i knew something was wrong, so i took half of a adderall 30mg to sober me up. little did i know that would send me over. Next thing i remember is waking up in the hospital and they told me i died. It‚Äôs been a few days now, i still have a bad left leg but it‚Äôs getting better. Crazy enough I only have some lung damage from aspiration but no brain damage or anything like that. but now I have to change my ways. I‚Äôm not sure what someone sees in me that I received a 2nd chance but I want to do something with it. I want to get sober again since I know i can. I‚Äôve done it before, I‚Äôm just scared what if i fall off? how can i do it right this time? I really feel like a relapse isn‚Äôt an option and that‚Äôs so scary to me. It‚Äôs either sobriety or death. There‚Äôs no in between now and i finally get that. idk, my brain is on overload right now",5

**Conflict**

""*We learn that conflicts are a part of reality, and we learn new ways to resolve them instead of running from them.*""Basic Text, p. 90

From time to time, we all experience conflicts.  It may be that we just can't get along with that new co-worker. Maybe our friends are driving us crazy. Or perhaps our partner isn't living up to our expectations. Dealing with any conflict is difficult for recovering addicts.

When tempers rise, it is often a good idea to  back away from the situation until cooler minds prevail. We can always  return to further discussion when we have calmed down. We can't avoid  troubling situations, but we can use time and distance to find  perspective.

Conflict is a part of life. We can't go through our entire recovery without encountering disagreements and differences of opinion.  Sometimes we can back away from these situations, taking time  to reflect on them, but there always comes a time when conflict must be resolved. When that time comes, we take a deep breath, say a prayer, and apply the principles our program has given us: honesty, openness,  responsibility, forgiveness, trust, and all the rest. We didn't get clean to keep running from life - and in recovery, we don't have to run anymore.

**Just for Today:** The principles my program has given me are sufficient to guide me through any situation. I  will strive to confront conflict in a healthy way.

2021-07-03 20:32:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/od9rc1/i_am_tired/,I am tired,"I am 33 years old and closer to 2 years sober than one.  I don't need to drink/drug but today I am tired and alone. I'm tired of so many social interactions revolving around alcohol. I'm tired of the pity friends, co-workers, family and strangers have for me. I'm tired of the concerned looks while out to dinner when everyone orders drinks. I'm tired of the awkward pauses or explanations when someone goes for a beer run and asks what everyone wants. I'm tired of the awkward shuffle when the bong is set up at a barbecue and word is being ""whispered"" around behind my back. I'm tired of conversations of future events where people offer assurances there will be fucking la croix for me. I'm tired of explaining I don't drink in/via dating profile apps. I'm tired off meeting up with people I haven't seen in awhile and asserting that I don't want to go to a bar. I'm tired of family almost panicking if they haven't heard from me in a certain period of time.

I got home from a week long work trip in South Beach Miami super late last night. It was a difficult week. It's like every social event there was an excuse to drink. Every restaurant a ""front"" for a bar. I've been restless, irritable and discontent. I'm expecting many of these feelings to fade but enough have been building and lingering for some time now. I've worked a 12 step program that has been essential to my recovery, mental health and the meaningful life I have today. I've always been slightly introverted. I have solid friends who are sober. I have life long friends who are not. I have family and co-workers who are not. I've learned to be more social. I do enjoy it but it does wear on me over time. I got sober right before the coronavirus shut everything down. As life returns to normal I'm faced with an increasing number of interactions like those I listed above. Those outside my sober circle. Despite being far happier and healthier than I've ever been they are making me feel different and broken. This fuels my desire to shut down. To completely avoid people and things I care about. Not because I want to or because they make me want to drink. Not because the people there don't care about me or don't want me there. It's because I'm tired of justifying my recovery. Tired of feeling different or outcasted. Tired of explaining I'm truly fine, happy and healthier than ever to people who don't understand. I'm tired of these everyday situations that make me want to withdraw into habits that are unhealthy for me.

There are so many things that I am grateful for not being tired of anymore. Being constantly sick and suffering. Being financially destitute, truly alone, desperate and suicidal to name just a few. I'm not discounting how huge these things are. I'm aware that it is far more than a fair trade.

Edit: My friends/family/coworkers fully support my recovery. I wouldn't associate with people who do not. This is a me problem and I'm sharing to work it out. Thank you all for your responses and I hope everyone has a great weekend!",21

I don't really have that much to say because I simply feel incredibly serene and 'light'. No more 'heavy, hefty feeling'. I couldn't have done it without this community. Despite the pandemic, the past 18 months have been the more fruitful, miraculous months of my entire life.  It's not as if my physical situation has changed that much; I still live in the same house and I still don't have an amazing job. But the simple fact that I don't wake up with hangovers  every day is simply amazing. Without even mentioning the arrest warrants and the shame from all the embarrassing and possibly illegal things I used to do in active addiction. This really is the ultimate freedom. I may have been quarantined for nearly my entire sobriety, but it's only now that I've discovered what it means to be free.",68

**Quiet time**

*‚ÄúMany of us have found that setting aside  quiet time for ourselves is helpful in making conscious contact with our  Higher Power.‚Äù*

**Basic Text, p. 95**

Most of us pay lip-service to the value of conscious contact with a Higher Power.¬† Yet how many of us consistently take time to improve that conscious contact?¬† If we‚Äôve not already established a regular regimen of prayer and meditation, today is the day to start one.

A ‚Äúquiet time‚Äù need not be long.¬† Many of us find that twenty to thirty minutes is enough time to quiet ourselves,  focus our attention with a spiritual reading, share our thoughts and  concerns in prayer, and take a few moments to listen for an answer in  meditation.¬† Our ‚Äúquiet time‚Äù need not be lengthy to be effective,  provided it is consistent.¬† Twenty minutes taken once a month to pray  will probably do little but frustrate us with the poor quality of our  conscious contact.¬† Twenty minutes taken regularly each day, however,  renews and reinforces an already lively contact with our Higher Power.

In the hustle and bustle of the recovering addict‚Äôs day, many of us end up going from morning to night without taking time out to improve our conscious contact with the God we‚Äôve come to understand.¬† However, if we set aside a particular time of the day,  every day, as ‚Äúquiet time,‚Äù we can be sure that our conscious contact will improve.

**Just for today:**¬† I will set aside a few moments, once I finish reading today‚Äôs entry, to pray and meditate.¬†  This will be the beginning of a new pattern for my recovery.

I wasn't a heavy drug user. No needles, mainly pot and white cross (later learned i have ADHD). Moving away from my friends made it real easy because I was not one to go knocking on doors to find drugs. Drinking on the other hand, Not so easy.... I technically have 35 years sober....

My first 10 years of sobriety came from 1976-1986. I had my first REAL spiritual awakening and moved to Arizona where I got involved in church and ministry and I never even thought of drinking. Then I had a 10 year brain fart when I moved back to Wisconsin and my new friends at a new church thought that since Jesus turned water into wine it was ok. I guess most of my friends would say I did fine. I didn't end up in detox, I didn't get picked up for drunk driving and I didn't go to jail but that last one was only because I never got caught drinking and driving.

I should have had a clue when that first glass of wine with dinner turned into an empty bottle before the meal was over and the next 10 years turned from glasses of wine and cans of beer to big boxes of wine and cases of beer.  It took nearly losing my license as a counselor for making a call to a client when I was drunk that finally turned me around.

So how do you do it? One day at a time. In the beginning one second at a time. A minute was too long.

For those of us who have the added a challenge of a mental illness (my work for 30 years as a counselor and going to recovery meetings for at least 25) has shown me that the majority of those in recovery have an underlying mental illness..... a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes the messages to misfire and get us going in wrong directions.  Thank God I learned this early on an got the medical help I needed but it is the ""recovery"" part and those in the program that have helped me the most.

So for your newbies..... keep coming back. Get a sponsor. Go to meetings. Share your story and listen to those who have gone before you. Keep posting here...people are awesome. And if you need a higher level of treatment, counseling etc do it.

Think of what it cost to use! The money spent on your own use and what you bought or gave to friends or strangers when you were under the influence. All the things that go with using cost too like missing work because you are hungover or losing your job all together! Divorce, emergency room visits, OTC meds for hangovers, and so many more costs! Invest in your sanity and the lives of others. It will serve you well. You can become a faucet of HOPE to others and giving them the Help Opportunity Praise and Encouragement they need to ""just say no"" could have an eternal reward. It is worth the investment.

If you need help feel free to reach out. I would love to share my experience strength and hope.",15

So I have an addiction to alcohol. Was sober for almost a year but relapsed in the middle of May. 

I went to hang out with one of my old coworkers yesterday. Her and her husband both drink and I knew I would be drinking so I walked (they only live four streets away from me, about a ten min walk).

This bender has been worse than my usual. I drank at her house but no more than I usually do. I‚Äôve definitely had my fair share of blackouts but I‚Äôm usually always able to remember at least some things.

I went there around 5 ish. I remember everything from the first few hours but after about 8 or so. I forgot EVERYTHING.

I don‚Äôt remember leaving or what time I left, I don‚Äôt remember walking home or if coworker gave me a ride.

I‚Äôm not normally one to post on social media when I‚Äôm drunk but this time I did. I don‚Äôt even remember posting anything, but my mom texted me freaking out about a post I made on Facebook. It was some weird ass post, something about making blood memories and getting abortions if you don‚Äôt want kids. It made absolutely zero sense. 

I checked my Reddit account this morning and posted some weird shit on AITA. That post was something like ‚ÄúAITA for being honest with my fianc√© and my family.‚Äù And posted about I me (25F) and an old FWB(34M) were engaged. Posted that my sister was pissed about it. Then totally sidetracked and posted that I applied for unemployment and my family is mad.

Then sidetracked AGAIN and said I‚Äôm fine with talking about my drinking and art successes with people but my mom and cousin were claiming my work and taking credit for it. 

Mind you, I don‚Äôt do art, I‚Äôm not artsy at all and I‚Äôm definitely not engaged, I don‚Äôt even have a boyfriend.

I woke up this morning and just had this weird feeling that something isn‚Äôt right. My coworker and husband only drink and smoke weed (as far as I‚Äôm aware). 

I‚Äôm so paranoid that I‚Äôve basically convinced myself that maybe I ran into someone while walking home and maybe somehow got drugged.

I also might just be super paranoid and overthinking.",2
