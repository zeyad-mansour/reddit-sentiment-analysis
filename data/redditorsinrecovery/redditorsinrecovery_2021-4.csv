I have an 8m old with a heroin/crack addict. I love him so much but am not good and do not know how to support him. It’s gotten to a bad point with him to where I’m finding needles and cant have that around my child. 

So he is finding his own place after he leaves a 30 day rehab that he is going into next week. I met him when he was 2 years sober. And he relapsed during my pregnancy, got clean and moved back in, and relapsed again, and has now relapsed again. So it’s been too many times...I tried to be empathetic ans tried to be there for him but I don’t know how. I’m in nursing school full time and I work and I’ve been taking full care of our child and it’s mentally and physically exhausting. So now to be confirmed that he is using again is just really hard.
How can I support him when we live seperate? I’m not going to keep his child from him by any means but he can’t have the baby by himself of course. I love him. I want to support but not enable. I just don’t know how to do it at this point. I’m driving him to the rehab and everything and will pick him up but I’m just trying to figure out some pointers on how to handle this. I am praying that he can become sober for himself and the baby. 

Any advice?

This is the longest consecutive amount of clean time I've ever had. I'm really surprised I've made it this far. Especially because of my chronic pain and how I used to be. I was ALWAYS the victim. I hated the idea of NA and the only God that existed was junkie Jesus.

Today, I am empowered. I have found that NA works fantastically for me (go figure) and I am so damn lucky that I survived my addiction thus far because not everyone does. I’ve lost my brother and cousin to addiction and I’ve seen the devastating results of that.

I am proud to be a chronic pain patient in recovery from addiction.

At 8.5 months clean I was craving badly and it was looking like I wasn't going to make 9 months.

I was ready to cave. I was scheming and scamming and had a whole relapse plan that I intended to carry out. Somehow though, someway, I realized that if I put as much effort into scheming as I might my recovery, I might have a shot.

So, instead of scheming and scamming as per usual, I tried something different, stepped entirely outside of my comfort zone and moved into a sober living.

It made all the difference for me. I now have 9 amazing roommates and I love living here for the time being.

Asking for help 8.5 months in wasn't easy too. I knew without any kind of change though, I would relapse. I cannot help but be genuinely proud of myself right now for making it to 9 months.

So, now it's onto one year and beyond, one day at a time. I can do this.",113,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50365657}"

They checked my blood alcohol level and it said 0.00 that was the first time  in idk how long I could say that I was completely sober.

When I went in I was at my most Vulnerable state I have ever been in and it was the most traumatizing moment of my whole life.

Today I have a lot of emotions to think where I once was a year ago. How I had let alcohol take over my life and keep me locked up in this cage I could never get out of. It put me in a place where I weak, scared, and had no voice.

When I went into the hospital I was looked at and treated like someone who was on drugs and was told over and over again I was a heroin addict because how sick I was. Shaking, unable to breathe or stand on my own the nurse could careless. After getting assessed by the nurse they took me to a room to lay down on a bed

This was the beginning of Covid and the hospital was out of masks. They had paper towels folded in half with rubber bands stapled to the sides. They put one on me when I first got there. I already couldn’t breathe as it was and they tell me to lay down to put in an IV. When I laid down the paper towels went into my mouth and nose. I was suffocating 

I sat up so I could breathe. The nurse called for for someone to come put in the IV. When someone came to help she got on the bed and held the mask over my mouth and nose making it so I couldn’t breathe at all. 

As I laid there in tears thinking this was how I was going to die. Thinking I put myself here. Making myself so weak and vulnerable I could not fight back. It was the scariest moment of my life.

She held the mask over my face she yelled “Lay the fuck down! We’re in the middle of a pandemic you little shit!” I had used my last drop of energy trying to sit up so holding me down wasn’t something she needed to do. I wasn’t fighting because I couldn’t. I was on the verge of passing out so she climbed off the table so I could breathe. Heroin

After multiple try’s they finally got the IV in. The nurse continued to say I was on heroin and treated me like it too. She asked if I was cold because I was shaking, but then told me that sucks. A doctor would come in and turn off the lights so I could rest and she would come in the room just to turn them on because a drug addict doesn’t deserve sleep. After being there for what felt like a lifetime, I finally had stop shaking and had gained some strength back. When the nurse came back in and started telling me that I was on Heroin again I used everything I had in me to yell at her “I don’t do fucking heroin!!!!” She called me a lair and left the room. 

She came back into the room and told me she had talked to my husband. My husband told her that I had a substance abuse problem. She then yelled at me saying that when someone says they have a substance abuse problem that means drugs not alcohol. She told me that alcohol is not a substance. Never once did she apologize. Never once did she even look like she felt bad. It was seriously the scariest moment of my whole life. 

Fucked up people are out there and will take advantage of you when ur that weak it’s soooo horrible. But everyone has a different path to sobriety but I pray to god yours is nothing like mine. You just gotta tell yourself your better then all this!! Don’t put yourself in the position I did, don’t make urself almost die to get sober. Do it for you, do it to be happy again, do it to feel good inside and out! I can honestly say sobriety is a beautiful thing and will make life so much better you just gotta believe in yourself.... and I believe in you... you can do this just be strong",49,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8699098}"

Death is always just around the corner. Live every day like it could be your last. Love life. Celebrate life. Say yes. Give yourself a reason to stay on this street and not go around that corner. There’s nothing you enjoy about getting high you can’t enjoy sober and there are so many things to enjoy in recovery that become impossible when you’re high. Don’t live in your trauma. Celebrate having survived it. You may have been set up to fail. So show off your success. Recovery isn’t about the material things. It’s about not hating yourself. It’s about being glad you woke up. It’s about making the most of each day as it passes.,83,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6287581}"

To get into every aspect would take along time so I’ll try to shorten it up. My apartment doesn’t have a washer/dryer so once a week I go to my parents house with my 1yo daughter to do laundry. My little brother lives there and he is off, way off. Anyway. My brother gets annoyed with my daughter. He got mad, really mad that we moved the dogs water dish so my daughter would play in it. He starts screaming like a psycho. It was fucking scary that, that could cause so much anger and he scared my daughter so bad she was hyperventilating. I asked him if he felt like a man for making a baby cry and I guess that got to him because he PUNCHED me in the side of the head! He punched like the little bitch that he is so it didn’t hurt. I have been so nervous that he would do something to my daughter, so glad it was just me. 

I guess from getting high most of my life, when something bad happens- everyone automatically puts the blame on me. My mom said I provoked him! I can’t believe she would try to protect him over my daughter and me. I should have called the cops but my dad promised Me he would get him in somewhere for help... months later nothing has happened.

My fiancé, I told him I needed him. I needed his support. Well, he told me(weeks later) that he was already getting high at that point so that’s why he couldn’t be there. He spent every dime we had saved. Started bringing drugs in our apartment. Smoking crack in our little apartment when we were sleeping. Gone for days at a time... He was up for days and completely crazy. I tried to baracade the door and he punched right through it, screaming at me where’s the money. You better give me my money.. well It was already gone at that point. When MY unemployment went through that week he withdrew it right away leaving us with literally nothing. It got much worse when I moved in with my sister. With us not there he went completely off the wall.

In his crazed mind, he thought I left because I was cheating on him?! Oh it can’t be him, he didn’t cause all this he always needs someone to blame. But then he tells his mom, he caught me cheating on him and I stole all his money. It was fucking unreal. 

Late night my phone would blow up from him. He wanted proof of where I was and what I was doing... he was being abusive, obsessive and ruining everything. I can’t believe what kind of monster he turned into.

He finally crashed hard one night, his body couldn’t stay awake any longer. The only thing is he fell asleep out front of a WaWa in his car with it running. So he was arrested for a DUI. He is going to lose his CDL. 

Of course, now he decides to check into a rehab. I got him a lawyer, sent him shampoo, deodorant and cigarettes. At the end of the day I want him to be okay... but we have been down this road too many times together and this was the worst it has ever been. Plus we have our kid now. I don’t know if I want to work things out this time. I am so mad, angry, turned off. I fucking hate him so much for destroying something I worked so hard for. I have a little over 2 years cleaned and was actually starting to see my dream come true. But he ruined it all.  On top of that I am still dealing with shit with my parents and that situation. At least I am less clouded now from postpartum, my head is clearer now then it has been for the past year. 

And bammmm!!! I thought unemployment was extended but I not receiving it. Can’t get through on the phone or the live chat. Just every aspect of my life is in shambles.. 

I want a better life, I am going to provide the best life possible for my daughter. I am not giving up. I need to figure things out. I think it is time for a fresh start.

One of her desires which she has validated with me is to improve her balance, and I figure that both physical therapy would be a good option, but of course I figured that the Xanax may be contributing to it as well. Does anyone have any recommendations on how I could get her tapered off of it? I don't really know who we should talk to (her doctor or a specialist), because it would be better to have a doctor supervise it.

Hi. Looking for some help, my boyfriend tried to detox on his own about 6 days ago. He drank upwards of 2 pints of whiskey a day (that I know of, so I’d be naive not to think it absolutely was more than that). He’s had pancreatitis twice, once in October of last year, once when he was younger that ended up with him in a coma and on a ventilator for a few months.  Last week he had a usual heavy night of drinking then started his tapering the next day.  I don’t know for sure how much he did or didn’t drink that day-I know he did have alcohol, he said a few beers I don’t know how many or for sure any details with that. He then had a seizure around 6am. It was nearly 7-10 minutes long, it was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen. We had no alcohol in the house and scared it would happen again I got him a few beers. He refused to go to the er. The other person in the house who I got up didn’t think we needed to call 911 because he came around by the time they were there. He was out of it for a bit then back to normal. Went to work, etc etc. he’s high functioning, and I know he only could because he had alcohol in him at that point. He’s been having episodes of confusion, and memory loss for a few months now. He was diagnosed with bipolar, stress disorder, he says the episodes are disassociation from pretty devastating events he’s had over the last year etc.. I’ve noticed his balance is off, but again, alcohol does that to anyone...his vision is weird and his eye twitches constantly.  Admittedly these things do get worse when he is stressed. But I have a feeling it may be more along the lines of- something is stressful, he drinks, symptoms worsen- and it’s all from alcohol damage.  Ive been really concerned for a while now, but after the seizure he had I’m terrified. He refuses to go anywhere. I’ve tried to get an appointment just to have scans and blood work done, to see how bad things are and really in hopes he would see how bad and or the dr ordering them would convince him to go to a hospital or medical detox- every office I’ve talked to refuses to even see him and said he has to go to an er.  I’ve been pushing for just a medically monitored detox right now, obviously more long term or more serious intervention is needed in general for sustainable recovery but I figured a quick stay was my best bet with talking him into anything and he clearly needs to be medically watched so he doesn’t die coming off of it. He says he’s going to taper very slowly, he’ll get help when and if he needs it and that he can’t go anywhere became he has to finish some jobs.  I know that’s part of the disease - denial, justification, minimizing etc. I’m not mad at him, I’m just really really fucking scared this is worse than we know, and it’s not something that can wait for his work. I’ve told him I think he’s at risk for another seizure, and soon, or worse death. It doesn’t seem to matter what I say right now.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m thinking of leaving if he won’t agree to a medical detox.  I’m so scared he will over do it when I go and it’ll be bad.  I know the best way to help him is to get him somewhere safe by any means, but I also know it’s going to take a lot more than me leaving to do that.  So do I stay and keep pushing as hard as I can for him to go to a hospital or do I leave and hope it pushes him to do it? I know no one can decide for me. But I need some insight or help with figuring it out.  Any thing is appreciated.",3,{'ventilator': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7422965}"

I am sober says I’ve saved over 45k. I’ve also saved what brain function I have left. I was smoking an 1/8 potent weed a day along with 2grams of really potent cartridges everyday. This past year was filled with the worst withdrawals imaginable. Still having some sort of post acute withdrawals. I just started a nursing bsn program that honestly I wasn’t about to attend cause it’s so damn expensive and my brain function is not what it was. Im taking the chance anyways. I had really good grades before this horrible relapse. Had to pass like 16 prerequisites to get into the damn nursing school. I started studying heavily maybe 6 months ago maybe 8-10 hours a day with breaks. At 1st I couldn’t remember anything but it’s slowly gotten better. Still not where I’d like it to be. I have adhd meds available but I feel like that will just fry my dopamine receptors even further and cause insomnia.,82,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58469343}"

I have gone from the top of the world to the depths of despair in the blink of an eye. 

I’ve been lurking for weeks reading everyone’s posts. They have given me a glimmer of hope. I am the girl who always has something to say and who talks nonstop even without drugs and until now I have tried multiple times to write a post but couldn’t even articulate how I was feeling. Sorry for the novel guys. 


30F. Misdiagnosed with ADD 15 years ago in 9th grade. Was prescribed full doses of vyvanse and adderall simultaneously until 2016. At 17 i completed my first IOP program. Since then I’ve gone to detox, inpatient and completed IOP/PHP programs too many times to count. I haven’t taken any amphetamines in a while mainly because they’re hard to find. I never was exposed to crystal growing up & used to joke w my friends “can you imagine if I did crystal meth?? Thank God I don’t do crystal meth.” Because I already knew that it would be psycho. 

      In December 2018 I tried crystal for the first time. Since then I have had various lengths of sobriety & went to rehab twice. The longest amount of time I had was 9 months until I relapsed this past October. Since trying it in 2018 I have had 5 periods of binges, which in total don’t even add up to a year. 

     I have had two teeth pulled in the last two years. Have a third that will have to be pulled next week. I’m a type two diabetic and it has contributed to my awful neuropathy. I have gone to the ER twice this year, within 3 days, for severe dehydration. I have trigger finger in both my hands majority of the time. My skin is picked to shreds. I go into psychosis often. I’m scared of my own shadow. I accidentally hurt myself regularly. I spend more money on pedialyte & icy hot & other treatments for my drug-induced ailments than I do on actual ice!!!! I am a hot fucking mess to say the least....

       I have never felt this hopeless about getting sober again. I usually am quite confident, I know exactly what to do to create lasting sobriety. This time is different- It’s darker. It’s so much bigger than me and I honestly feel like I don’t stand a chance. It’s like a black mass that follows me everywhere and I can’t escape it. I know that my addiction does want me dead. That’s it’s job, to fucking kill me, right? 

     I don’t know who I have become. Who that monster is in the mirror. The shell of a girl who used to be everyone’s most positive & happy-go-lucky friend. 

     Meth- The devil I know. It’s just plain evil. Cunning baffling & powerful. I am paying an extremely high price to destroy everything around me. My body hates me, my soul is gone & my spirit broken. But, I found my holy grail after all these years. Now that I’ve tasted this, how could I ever give this up???? How??? It’s honestly such a mind fuck because I end up feeling 100x worse than the initial negative emotions I use to escape from. There is no better living through chemistry. It’s all a fucking lie. The human body is NOT meant to feel this good ever. It’s just not. It’s not authentic, it’s superficial as fuck. 

     I want sobriety. I want peace of mind. I want my 3yr old son to grow up with his mother and be proud of her one day. I don’t wanna break my parents hearts anymore or make my mother cry. I want to make myself proud. It’s really simple- give up everything for one thing OR give up one thing for everything. Why is this even up for debate? Well, because I have so many reservations. I’ve never stayed sober longer than 9 months over the course of 13 years. History has shown that it never seems to stick long-term which I believe leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy of my relapses. FEAR- Failure expected and received. Fear runs my life. It is my jailer. Everyday I am sentenced to my very own hell. Sobriety is like a carrot dangling in front of my face but I can’t quite reach it. It seems like the most unattainable of goals.

     I was supposed to end my binge this past weekend but I am terrified of coming down. I slept last night (thankfully) & had one small line to get me through work today. Then I’m gonna buy some more weed to combat the inevitable comedown. Tomorrow I am getting the vivitrol shot. In 2019 I got the shot for 4 months to kill my cravings & when I didn’t get my 5th shot I relapsed. I can’t help but believe there is a correlation here!! I take Wellbutrin as well and as many of you probably know there are new studies suggesting the vivitrol/Wellbutrin duo for methamphetamine addicts. 

      I want to start working out for the endorphins and so that I don’t gain all my weight back. I have a top-notch therapist. I have decided to try SMART Recovery because I like the CBT approach. I also want to try Life Ring which is a secular sobriety program. AA will always be my home & I strongly believe in its principles & the effectiveness of step work but I feel like it’s time to try something different. I don’t hangout w tweakers so I honestly don’t have a lot of people to cut out of my life which is a plus. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic and is so supportive. My child’s dad as well as my parents are also very supportive and I am very fortunate. I know what needs to happen. 

      My problem isn’t lack of knowledge but lack of application of that knowledge. The only thing in my way is ME. If a better life if what you want, you first have to take off the noose. People don’t change til it hurts bad enough. Although I don’t quite yet want to be sober more than I want to use, it fucking hurts y’all. I’m ready to get out of my own way. I want to be the comeback kid. Every hero has adversity in their past otherwise they wouldn’t be a good hero. & lastly, as Bukowski once said- “if you’re worried about losing your soul you still have soul left to lose”

Alright, so im new to this forum. I have been sober since March 20 2021. I am 32 years old later this month and had my first drink at 16 but didnt start to drink heavy until I was 23. So thats nearly 9 years. 

I feel like I don't really have any reasons to be drinking this way anymore. I feel like the reasons I started drinking a lot at 23 are things that have no effect on me anymore, but yet as life continued on and another challenge happened I would always turn right back to the wine.

Its just an unhealthy coping mechanism. I am not 100% sober as I smoke weed. I respect all opinions just understand that for now it works for me. I have a job, something I literally cannot do when I was drinking. Even if I kept to my rules, alcohol effects my moods too much.

The way I look at it is, it doesnt make me a sinner if I choose a plant that keeps me calm over a drink that makes me so unbalanced. But, I would one day like to just smoke occasionally. 

Ever since I got sober in march, I got a job, I let go of my codependency, I've made goals for myself, and I'm really just feeling positive this time around getting sober.

2021-04-09 14:17:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/mnna08/facing_what_hurts_us_betters_everything_we_do/,Facing what hurts us betters everything we do; this is what I have learned about getting rid of painful thoughts.," We all have painful thoughts from difficult situations and/or abuse we lived through. Some you might not believe happened to you. From cruel relatives who brought us up to snarky classmates, brutally strict teachers, difficult neighbors, hateful and demanding bosses, vindictive co-workers, former and current narcissistic partners or spouses; our memories include them. Many times they surface on their own, and other times they pop up in their full combat mode when we think about something we want to accomplish, making us retreat into our paralyzing turmoil we can't shut off until we learn how.

For example, have you found an outfit that made you smile and wanted to buy, but the criticizing voices in your head shamed you into changing your mind? Do your thoughts say things like you're too fat, too stupid, too ugly, and/or people will laugh at you? 

Has that been your experience? Do you have similar experiences? Maybe you came across a job you wanted, only to talk yourself out of it in record time? You'll get fired, you can't do that, you're not smart enough, no one will respect you, love you, hire you, and/or want you?

Did you hear that growing up? I did. My family brainwashed me into believing those horrid words by repeatedly pummeling me with their toxic waste, grinding down my fragile self-esteem so often that I believed them. They taught me well, convincing me I was defective and to cower in shame. 

As a result, I became impaired, not realizing I lacked the healthy foundation based on healthy self-esteem to manage my life successfully. Instead, with painfully low self-esteem, I became a self-destructive promiscuous low-income addict mess going from job to job, struggling to support myself, and drinking and driving. 

Diagnosed with clinical depression in the early 1990s and with complex ptsd in 2017, I can see why my life was the screwed up chaos it was. 

So, for me, living crippled with depression and complex ptsd was like being stranded on the highway median between 4 opposing lanes of highway with busy traffic rocketing by me not being able to escape to either side, to free myself from danger. 

I say was because my life today is calmer, happier, and more productive than it was back then, but my question to you is this: Can you identify with my writing? Part of me hopes you do, but part of me hopes you don't. If you do, then you too have been brainwashed with toxic waste in your life.

Now, this is what I learned that helped me heal: There is a process to work through those memories to get rid of them, to FREE yourself from them! I know it intimately because I have used it for years! 

I began focusing on and blogging about what scared me on October 17, 2012. I embraced this habit and made this habit *my own* and have used it thousands of times. The benefits are rewarding and astonish me daily. I feel more at peace than I ever have; I don't lay awake at night, worrying myself sick like I used to. 

Before, I was trying to decide what to do with problems with my traumatized brain. Most of the time, the results did not work well at all. Getting rid of their spewed poisonous puke makes it so much easier for me to come up with solutions and to map out what I want to do *and* how to get myself there. I am more efficient and practical than I ever thought I could be. And that is because of the hard work I have done and still do today to continue to clear up and rid myself of the emotional wounds that held me back. Don't the words emotional wounds sound better than mental illness? I prefer it.

Ok, to get back on track, if this process is new to you, I urge you to find a professional counselor who can help you through these steps. Remember, your therapy sessions are just that: they are YOUR sessions for you to work through what troubles you. You decide what your topics are and you decide the pace. 

Back to my subject, think of something or someone who upsets you. What do you think it would feel like to face them calmly, thinking on your feet and not being intimidated by them? Even running into them somewhere or talking about that situation and not being upset by it. It not only makes you feel better by keeping your cool, it strengthens you at the same time. And that benefits your self-esteem.

I have experienced that several times. And let me tell you, not having all that torment and crap flying around in my brain is as refreshing as a delightful spring rain. When I think of something I want to do now, my brain is on board with me. I don't have to fight my way through complex ptsd flashbacks or the constant toxic waste spewed by my mother and sisters chanting hateful criticisms in my face for hours. Hearing that all the time creates a lifelong pattern in our brains. 

The reason for that pattern lies in how our brains learn and operate. So, if you grew up surrounded by people who ripped your fragile self-esteem daily, your brain becomes traumatized by the constant attacks. Young brains are still developing and trauma impairs the brain structures, which impairs the development. Amnesia is one result of that. Complex ptsd is another. So is depression, and several more.

Think of soldiers who have seen combat. They have developed brains, yet the trauma of combat impairs their brain function. The changes show up in moodiness, depression, illness, fear and more. They need to see a counselor and also a psychiatrist for medications to help them get better. 

One thing that can benefit us is knowing our brains are ""plastic"" meaning we can change how our thoughts play out.

For example, neuroplasticity can be viewed as a general umbrella term that refers to ***the brain’s ability to modify, change, and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience.***

How mind-blowingly COOL is that? Yes, I know ""blowingly is not an official word, but please work with me!

Ok, here's the process with some more explaining:

First, I had to admit and accept how deeply that behavior or those words wounded me. My hurt feelings, the pain I felt and drank and drugged to not think about, damaged me. It held me back because the more often I heard those hateful, untrue words, my brain believed them. That is how we learn, right? Doing homework when we were in school, we had to read and reread what we needed to learn to pass our classes. We believe what we tell ourselves and those hateful, untrue words dominate our thinking. 

Now, why would that be? Why doesn't the negative poison settle down and chill out? 

Ahhh! I am glad you asked! It is because that negative, toxic waste does not belong to us. It is not at home inside of us. It has to go. That is why it bothers us so much. It *needs* to go!! It needs to be kicked to the curb so our wounded, hurt feelings can heal, which betters our lives along the way.

So, how can we do this?

How I turned my thoughts around began with blogging about what I gave thanks for daily on February 12, 213. I still give thanks daily, but I stopped blogging about it over a year ago, I think on March 24, 2020. I can't explain why, but then that was what felt like I needed to do. I will start that back up because I love writing about it, plus I think people reading about it on my blog could benefit them. I am all for that because it is important to include it in a successful recovery lifestyle.

When I wrote with details about what I gave thanks for every day, I added positive thoughts to my negative thoughts. That slowly diluted the negative ones. I had to make my way through my negative crippling thoughts to heal my wounded emotions. Over time, I realized this: ***Our negative and distorted emotions fuel our negative and distorted thoughts, so to heal those thoughts, we have to heal what fuels them.***

Another thing I did was I watched movies that made me cry. The reason they made me cry was because something in the movie touched my soul at a deep level. The emotions tied to that pain surfaced. Because they surfaced, I allowed them to wash over me and evaporate in their timing. I did not hurry this process. Some movies I had to stop and cry for a while before I could continue to watch them.

The three movies I watched that stand out the most to me are these: Les Misérables, 12 Years a Slave, and the Salem Witch Trials. And like I said, it took me a solid week to get through each one. Again, I paced myself because I wanted to face those emotions the best I could. To describe to you what that was like for me was this: I felt sad for a few days. I didn't want to hurt anyone, or hunt down my abusers. I stayed home and let my emotions do their thing. Once I got through that portion, I felt happier and wanted to have fun. I took baking back up, which I stopped doing because of my depression.

I stink at pacing myself, but I tried to be careful about not overwhelming myself. I kept going because I needed to and I wanted to.

So this is the formula: facing plus accepting what wounds your emotions equals healing.  

You do this and you will learn a lot about yourself along the way and every day, you'll see tiny improvements that add up. I encourage you to keep notes so one month from now, or 6 months from now or whenever you want to, you can look back and see how far you have come! And that feeling of happy, fulfilling pride will feel better and last you longer than any drug, alcoholic drink, or any self-sedating behavior you did to manage your pain.

In closing another important benefit is as I kept going and keep using this technique, my real self buried under the brainwashed toxic waste I inherited from my hypocritical abusive family, is stronger every day. Back then, I was miserable and worried; today I am confident and doing everything I can to keep myself moving forward. It thrills me to see firsthand for myself the difference that hard work made in my life. 

Now my question to you is this: How can you take what I have written and make it your own, based on who you are? Where can you start, if you are ready to? What would help you the most, if you want to start this healing journey, remembering to pace yourself along the way? 

Remember, the decision is yours to do; when and how you start is your choice. It doesn't mean it is right or wrong; it is simply different to suit your needs. How you suit your needs is your responsibility and privilege to do. Now, you might see significant progress much sooner than I did. Your path will differ from mine, just as who you are will differ from who I am. So, take what I have written and not to pressure you, but, if you can and when you decide you are ready, surpass me!! But, don't compare yourself to me or to anyone. Just try to do better than you did before. Only compare yourself to yourself. That is what matters.

I’d like to get some fresh ideas from what has helped you guys? I’ll start with my biggest help.

I read an essay on Fredrick Nietzsche theory of master slave morality which essentially dictates that morality is born out of a power struggle between the two. Masters first create their values for their own quests for pride and power then the slaves reactively invert the value systems focused on more inward, ascetic goals due to their limited power and ultimately resentment. It led me a life changing realization that my whole life I was resentful of everything I couldn’t have due to having severe ADHD and poor social skills growing up. Rather than trying my best to adapt, I just re-evaluated my values through my religious beliefs at the time, effectively suppressing my desires and my emotions.

After that, my emotional numbness which left me with next to no feelings went up to about 20%. I could go out on a cool night and FEEL the fresh air again for the first time in years. 20% may not seem like much, but coming from zero, it’s huge. I had also automatically stopped compulsively drinking huge amounts and my drug use went down a pretty decent amount. I’ve wondered why that had happened and eventually came across a psychoanalytic theory that when a drive is repressed, it goes into the unconscious and into a pleasure seeking mode. It eventually led me to getting out of drugs for over two years before my recent relapse which I should be getting out of soon once I get into rehab.

Before anyone misinterprets, Nietzsche is trying to show the fundamental dichotomy of morality not so we can choose the masters morals over the slaves as most people think he’s suggesting, but rather so we can see through them both and find our own path that isn’t a victim of either resentment or blind quests for power. You’ll find a lot of people in recovery that found religion, particularly far eastern thought and practice, to be life changing. For me that’s not the case but the important thing is to find what is best for yourself without being a victim of either process.

I started my drug use with mdma and graduated to amphetamine addiction and descent into psychosis in a year. 

Mdma was appealing to me since I've been suffering from depression for years. At the time I wasn't aware of mdma's severe neurotoxicity and did mdma 7 times in a year spaced out. Last time it gave me a 20 day long comedown and suicidal depression.

Since speed at first gives mdma lite kinda high I switched to amph to chase that dragon and ended up on a month long binge. I did 10 grams tops.

When I stopped it took me 3 months to stop thinking about speed 60% of the time. 3 months of mood swings, a bit of stuttering, destroyed word recall, severe cognitive decline, slowed down thinking, derealisation, not being ""present""... For months I felt like something in the back of my mind was missing. My thoughts were volatile. When I tried to form and keep mental image of something they would evaporate.

Went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bipolar and ptsd.

On day 120 fog lifted and at 4.5 months there was some cognitive improvement. At 6 months cognition got much better. Bipolar psychosis also went away in  5-6 months with antipsychotics. 

I took nac, magnesium, omega3, d3 and nsi out of desperation.
Nac stopped mood swings and nsi improved my vision. It adds contrast kinda post processing to vision. Since nsi is experimental I would advise against it. For years I've been dead inside and nsi gave me child like emotions for a few days and made me so deeply unhappy to the depths I never though possible. My word recall and thinking got way better, but I can't claim it was the nsi that did it. I also feel like 90% of me is altered. 

I still dread waking up and hate the day I was born. At least I used to love working... Now I dread work. I have zero enthusiasm and motivation.

Can this much drugs do so much damage? Maybe the drugs were only a trigger. Are there any major improvements further down the road?

Any tips and timelines are welcome for both depression and recovery.

I ruled out the other two housemates, which means that unless I have a very small skunk right outside my window that's only home when he is, it's hard to ascribe it to any other source.

Unfortunately, I really should say something about it, as I have a neuroimmune illness that means light, sound, and smells can negatively affect my health (yay). If he wasn't in recovery I would have no trouble asking him to do it outside. But as it is, it seems like a more delicate matter than that (as in addition to AA he has been open that marijuana was also a problem for him).

I’m currently in rehab, my third time now in 4 years. I first entered treatment aug 2016 and was clean all the way until feb 2018 where I relapsed after numerous things happening to me simultaneously, but the main reason is me not being able to regulate my emotions properly. Went back to treatment for 2 months and was clean all the way till feb 2020, and I relapsed again (I’m primarily an alcoholic but use anything I can get my hands on after I’m tipsy and my this relapse it was meth, benzos and noids with the occasional pcp). This time my relapse was the longest, it lasted one whole year until feb 15 this year where I was fully psychotic and accepted the help being given to me and went back to rehab. 

I painfully learned that the reason I keep falling is because I’m trying to play god with my life. I was abused sexually very young and had bad anxiety and when I tried talking about it, I was laughed at and bullied. It was at this moment I retracted into my own fantasy world where everything is fine a no one can hurt me. I’ve been going there so much it had become a part of me and blended into my living world. Whenever the narrative of my life doesn’t go the way I want it to, I self sabotage by using and end up in the same cycle again. 

This is the first time I’ve spoken about this fantasy world of mine to my therapist as I’d always keep this part of me secret previously. I didn’t even think it was very important but I’ve now come to learn it is the most important thing in my recovery now. I have since smashed this fantasy world of mine and I feel very naked if that makes any sense. I’m doing good but all this time having the comfort of my fantasy world and suddenly having that gone makes me feel very uncomfortable.

Hi everyone. Day 7 of my boyfriend in rehab if you see my previous posts I’ve been going through a lot of different emotions this first week. I’m crying right now as I write this and just took my anxiety medicine to prevent a panic attack from happening. 

I probably had the worst phone call with him tonight just now since he got in there. Today is the day his first day off of his Suboxone and other medication they started him on (clonidine?) he’s off it all! so I know he’s having withdrawals and the way he talks to me is just back to his disrespectful drug self. He was so nice the first six days phone calls, It feels like he’s just back to his old shitty negative being self the person that I do not know. The person that is going through withdrawals and just evil. 

Is this normal behavior for someone who is in rehab? Because the last few days phone calls he seemed a lot more positive and happy I was actually shocked and I felt like oh the person I love is slowly coming back and it’s possible. But after tonight I just want to give up again and I don’t even know if I have it in me to do family therapy when it starts. He purposely hangs up after saying something condescending when he knows I suffer from anxiety disorder and knows I cannot call the rehab back this late. I feel he’s the person I don’t know. I’m so upset guys :( my heart is hurting and before this I felt it healing. I don’t even know if I can start doing family therapy I’m just so drained and after everything I’ve been through lately with him you would think he wouldn’t want to be such an asshole in rehab while I’m out here taking care of everything ! 

I could literally press charges for so many things and he could be homeless when he gets out but since he actually went to rehab to get help I stopped myself.

Thought I would post an update as well as seek advice after my original post a few months back. I actually did reconnect with my ex-gf/ghost. As I had mentioned before she was in a 12 month live-in treatment program and she ghosted me about 6 weeks into her treatment. We had been together for a couple of years and I loved her dearly. Always pushing to get her into treatment somehow or another. I had the dream of marrying this woman and she went to rehab with lots of love towards me and a ring on her finger. When she broke up with me I was devastated for so long, but was eventually able to pick up the pieces and find happiness in my life either though she had been absent from it for quite some time. 15 months later and we finally reconnected 2 weeks after she moved into her own place. She sent me a friend request and things started there. She stayed silent for almost a month after requesting to follow me, but one day I guess she assumed to make a move, because I definitely was not going to do it first. Not that I did not want to, but I presumed to give her the time she needed to ponder if it’s something she still wanted to do or if she was just being curious and seeing what I was up to. She finally reached out in an extremely passive way... she started blowing up my Instagram feed with likes on back to back photos. I chatted with a friend briefly for some advice and we both decided she was taking a step to communicate with me, but that she was most likely scared to send the first message in fear of anger or rejection on my end. I messaged her briefly with generic chit chat, let it rest for a couple of days, and then we ended up meeting for a catch up this past Easter Sunday of all days. We actually had a really great time. We laughed our butts off and didn’t speak too much of the past or the breakup. It was obvious we have both grown astronomically through this process. I attempted to hold her hand on the car ride home, about five mins before i dropped her off. She seemed scared and timid to do this, so she held my hand briefly then kind of gave me a friendly pat to break the physical contact. I haven’t let it upset me too much, though I can’t lie it did sting a bit, being that she is still the love of my life. I brushed it off and in my head I have chocked it up to the fact that she wouldn’t have taken the effort to meet with me for such a long date on a holiday, if she didn’t genuinely want to see me. I still genuinely love this woman and have been in the process of building a beautiful dream home for both of us that she has no virtually no idea about. She knows that I has plans to build a house for us assuming we would stay together during her treatment and also that I told her I was waiting on her regardless of hearing from her or not. I hope to invite her over in time. 
For the moment, I am grateful for the chance to reconcile and that it went so well. It was beautiful to experience her living a sober life, where she is dedicated to working on herself. I believe things will work out in time and that this will be a slow process. I haven’t heard from her since our date one Sunday, but it is only Wednesday and I am hoping she just needs some time to process. I sent her a single text message the day after our date and told her how great it was to see her and I hope to see her again before another year passes lol. She hasn’t responded yet, but again I believe she is just going to need some time. Time that I am willing to invest. Thoughts? Does anyone think we still have a chance or the fact that she made a point not to be physical with me just in the form of holding hands is a clear indicator that she is no longer interested?

The next day after a disappointing doctor appointment where he dismissed my concerns and said I didn’t need the surgery that I had just had, I went to the bar and 2 turned into 7. I can’t moderate. I was devastated that this doctor had blown me off, but drinking didn’t change that. I have got to stop drinking!

On Wednesday, I met with my boyfriend and listened to him tell me all about drunk me during the past week when I came home drunk on my son’s birthday. He had left me at the bar because I was acting so crazy. As he spoke, all I could think was, “I can never be “drunk me” again”. I went home feeling mortified and in despair. I didn’t talk to anyone. I was so embarrassed that I could not figure out drinking and for all the shit that had transpired since Covid started. I didn’t know how to do life without drinking, but my life was bad because I couldn’t handle my drinking.

These thoughts consumed me in my early days of sobriety. I couldn’t talk to my boyfriend because I had all but destroyed our relationship with “drunk me”. I couldn’t tell any of my friends because I really didn’t have any non drinking friends and I was too embarrassed. I felt like a failure. School was about to start, and that was a shit show in and of itself. My son came back and I had to be sober. I didn’t think I was bad enough for AA and I didn’t think I was an alcoholic. I was just someone who couldn’t handle her drinking. That made me feel like a failure. I finally told a colleague that I was quitting drinking because it was too much with the new school year and the new school. I could text her everyday with my day count and she would cheer me on. 

I have someone in my life who I used to be close to who is sober, but my drinking and drama filled life ended that friendship. I commented on a post of hers that I hadn’t had a drink in 6 days. We started messaging. She invited me to some sober mom groups on FaceBook. That was a thing? I began to post on there and people understood and supported me. Wow! I kept trying to find something to help me because I was just barely keeping everything going and staying sober. Supporting my son who was struggling with quarantine and starting a new school online. I felt overwhelmed at work because I was always in an alarmed state because my anxiety was through the roof with PAWS (post acute withdrawal symptoms). I told all my bar friends I was not drinking. I would still go because I was going crazy at home. But, I didn’t drink. I didn’t even want to. But I was a huge ball of nerves. I kept looking for anything that was not AA. Finally after I was 2 weeks sober, I told my daughter and my doctor. My daughter didn’t react because it wasn’t the first time I had told her I was quitting. My psychiatrist prescribed a new anti-anxiety drug because I wasn’t drinking. Wait? There was another med that I could have gotten to help with my anxiety as long as I wasn’t drinking and you never told me about that? Are you shitting me? I felt like I was proving myself to my boyfriend and my daughter. My first real moment of, “Oh my God! I need a drink.” was after helping my son with his homework. I had always drank when I was helping him with homework. I found a SheRecovers meeting and they cheered that I didn’t drink.  Maybe I had found meetings that would work. But, I still felt like I was searching. Does anyone know how hard it is to be a mom and not drink? Does anyone know how hard it is to be a teacher in 2020 and NOT drink? I found a recovery coach and met some people in AA. I went to a few meetings. Got my 30 day chip (my daughter came) and that was cool, but it wasn’t a good fit. Sober Mom Squad started on September 4th and I felt like, “Oh. This is my group.” Then, my sober mom friend said to try TLC. I came to my first meeting at 36 days. It was huge! I made more sober friends here in Colorado. People were so helpful in connecting me to other people. But, I was running ragged. Teaching full time. Parenting my son 5 days a week. Not sleeping at all. (I drank to sleep) and then my son had minor surgery. I picked my daughter up to help me. I had just listened to Ch 5 in Quit Like A Woman that stated that there was not a blood test for being an Alcoholic. That it wasn’t even a medical term. That alcohol is fucking addictive and I am not a bad person because I got addicted. I texted my daughter to listen to just that chapter. When I got to her house, she gave me small canvas she had painted for being 1 month sober. It was so sweet and I felt so supported. 

Four days later I got Covid. In the middle of all this shit, I got Covid. I now see those three weeks as the rehab I never got. I slept, listened to Laura’s book (I felt finally seen by a mom who struggled with drinking and did some crazy shit when she was drunk her), and I went to meetings non stop. I met Marie, the dear friend I never knew I needed- another single mom teacher who got it. She told me to let school go and just get better. Getting me to give up and not be “super teacher” was a huge step for me. My first week back from Covid, I feel fell apart that Friday trying to hold everything together. And I had my first aha moment in recovery - I drank so I wouldn’t fall apart because single mom’s aren’t supposed to fall apart. I started therapy when everything was spinning in those first 6 weeks and he was the first person to point out that I had a pretty fucked up childhood and not to gloss that over. No wonder I drank. There were moments the pain of truly looking at my childhood was going to kill me, and he said to take it in bite size chunks. 

I experienced a lot of painful moments in that part of my recovery that I had otherwise drank my way through. I started writing to process and I started a recovery blog called the Teacher Mom Alcohol Lie. I had had both areas of my life lie to me that I needed alcohol to manage them. I almost died when I was born (like 5 times) and my parents at one point gave up and accepted I was going to die. But, mother fucker, I lived and they never made it back to loving me and nurturing me. Something like 60% of us in recovery have attachment issues. It’s a thing, y’all. My older sister terrorized and beat me up through most of my childhood and that was blown off as normal. I lived in fear of her whenever mom and dad left the house. I didn’t have friends because I didn't know how to make them. I attempted suicide in 7th grade and my counselor told me - yeah that makes sense with everything you had going on. I was assaulted in college after I had been drinking and my family had no idea how to handle that. I was assaulted by a priest the next year, and I didn’t ever tell them that. My relationships were all trauma choices because I had no idea what love was. If you were nice to me and didn’t hurt me, that must be love. Facing all of this was all part of my early recovery. My marriages were trauma choices and I didn’t really experience love till I had my children. It was the first time in my life I wasn’t hustling for love. My love addiction came out after my divorces as a power play trying to fill that whole. Alcohol was a big part of that. Probably also a result of my sexual assaults. 

In the past three months, I have learned how to be alone. I am trying to reestablish my relationship with my boyfriend but once you start learning and knowing, you can’t unknow. I don’t know how that is going to play out. I am killing it as a teacher now that I am not drinking. Imagine that, not being hungover helps you deal with 7th graders instead of behaving and responding like one. My kids have watched me string together days, weeks and months. I came out on my FB page as sober around 85 days. I learned that alcohol makes anxiety worse. Celeste Yvonne wrote a great piece about anxiety attacks and alcohol. I wrote that I quit drinking because my anxiety was through the roof last summer and I wanted to see if it would help. I switched psychiatrists to someone who was honest with me about alcohol's impact on my anxiety. I started a teacher subgroup because, motherfucker, it is hard to teach sober when everyone condones and supports drinking to cope. I learned alcohol crippled my body’s response to anxiety and that I would never drink again. (Sober Powered Episode 22) I had major surgery and my daughter came down to take care of me for two weeks. She did everything. I held space for her as she shared how my drinking forced her to grow up too fast. Because sober me could do that, she forgave me. When she left after those two weeks, she started to cry as we hugged goodbye. She pulled back and sobbed, “I am going to miss you so much. I will come back down on my next day off and take care of you.” I was able to be an adult with her during those two weeks and not a mom. Sober me could never have done that. Sober me was able to get off pain meds in 7 days. Sober me has the honor of supporting newly sober moms in the SIS program for Sober Mom Squad and so many other newly sober people. And I am privileged enough to support some of you. My anxiety is now well managed with meds. I am confronting my disordered eating and learning to love my body. Learning is the operative word in that phrase. 

It all started with breaking up with drunk me. I shared recently that a couple of Fridays ago, I wanted to drink. My surgery recovery was stalling out, and everyday was a saga of whether or not I could go to the bathroom. I had this surgery to fix my issues with going to the bathroom, and after all that, I couldn’t poop. I was so worn out after three weeks and alone because my daughter had gone back to Fort Collins and I wanted to stop hurting. For so many of us, that is all our drinking was about- wanting to stop hurting.  I was able to play it forward and think about how it wouldn’t be a 12 hour break from my body. It was going to make me more trapped in my body because drunk me, who was also sad and overwhelmed, would have been a shit show. I didn’t drink, and that took about a week to process how close I was to drinking.  I could forgive myself for having the thought and tell her, “I see you. We don’t do that anymore.” Thanks, Mulrooney. Everything I have hustled for in my life I am now finding in my sobriety. It has been the hardest almost 8 months ever and I am closer to what I have always wanted for myself. I have learned my thoughts can lie.My emotions can’t kill me. Meetings are life. And you really can build friendships with people who you see on a screen. I am honored to walk this recovery road  with you and to share this with you today.",86,"{'covid': 4, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86612415}"

I'm in a really bad spot and running out of time.","Hello all, I am going to try to make this as short as possible but everytime I do that I just have to explain it all in the comments anyway.... but this one is pretty simple.  I got kicked out of where I've been staying a couple days ago, literally the day before that I bought a car (nothing nice or fancy just gets me from A to B for now I'm fucking praying it doesn't break down anytime soon) the problem is the car took every last dollar I had, which honestly wasn't much the car is way nicer than anything I expected. My sister has let me stay with her till Friday but not the night of the 6th so idk what I'm gonna do that day I have no other family or friends to to call or ask for help.


But besides that my sister is a meth addict, which has never been my thing it's honestly my least favorite drug I pass on it way more than I partake on it. But her house almost always has 3-5 other meth addicts here and another one living here sharing a giant sectional with me. It's driving me fucking insane, meth addicts are the single most annoying people to have to be stuck in a room with. And the other guy staying here stays up all God damn night with absolutely 0 respect for the fact im trying to sleep and actually have to fucking work.


Okay besides all that, I have been using door dash to make money to try to get a hotel or something, I make okay money but I gotta try harder. I DO NOT have car insurance right now and every single time I have to go door dash I freak the hell out, especially when it's dark out but I don't have any freaking choice and I'm terrified I am going to get pulled over and lose my license for 6 months for driving without it. I made enough this week to either get insurance or a room for 5 days. I was going to get insurance and ended my dash at 1130 last night. Sunday is the end of the week for door dash. I went to use my fast pay and there was a freaking block on my card for some reason and it wouldn't go through! 


I talked to a representative and we think we got it figured out but by the time we did it was 11:59. Now my money won't be in my account until Wednesday or Thursday. Probably Thursday knowing how slow my bank is. Now I have another whole week of driving around without insurance and honestly I'm on the verge of a freaking mental break down. Going to work is the only thing that keeps me away from the fucking meth addicts. I literally don't go back until midnight or later and try to just sleep but it usually doesn't happen like that. 




TL;DR:  Staying with meth heads and can't sleep. Working doordash without insurance and it's freaking me the fuck out I don't wanna lose my license, was too late on fast pay to buy insurance tomorrow and now I won't have the money to do it till Thursday and I hate every fucking thing.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82407993}"

I got rid of all my pipes and literally anything I could find. I even made sure I didn’t have any NyQuil around. (Early recovery showed me that my desperation could drive me to try anything i had within reach.) And after years of getting drunk/high/getting prescribed pills I wish I never had been, I was left with lots of crap in random places.

Being around people who were drinking and smoking for the first time since being in recovery was much easier than I expected. What I really wasn’t expecting was what would come afterwards. 

As soon as I got home, I suddenly had a very strong urge to use. Probably the most intense I’ve ever experienced since being in recovery. I really didn’t think I was capable of a relapse. Especially not at a time when it seemed as though my life was going well. But last night showed me otherwise. 

So I got home and without hesitation I ended looking in every single spot I could think of. I was digging through all my cabinets, old boxes, and bags- hoping to find a lost klonopin or even cold meds that I may have missed during my clean-out (even though I knew I didn’t have any)

I found some ibuprofen and heartburn pills in random drawers. I searched online to see what they were (even though they were CLEARLY just ibuprofen and my heartburn meds)

The addiction demon inside of me is a fucking lunatic. I know thats a harsh word to use, and I’ve got a lot of love and compassion for that part of me, but I don’t know how else to describe it. Watching all of this unfold really felt like an out of body experience. It was like I was watching myself become possessed and I couldn’t stop it. 

Luckily I outsmarted this demon while I was in my right mind by planning ahead. In addition to getting rid of ANYTHING I could potentially use, I also had some emergency chocolate on hand. And as much as I wish I didn’t binge on chocolate last night, I also realize it could have been so much worse. 

So I ended up baking cookies and writing some (mostly shitty) songs about how this all felt. And before I knew it, the intensity had passed, and I was falling asleep on the couch. My apartment looked like an explosion had taken place, but I ignored the mess, got up from the couch, and made myself feel nice and cozy in my bed. And this morning I woke up with another day of sobriety.

I have no idea what to even do anymore and I have no will to try. [Long],"So I've slowly come to realize I don't even know who the hell I am anymore. I know who I used to be years ago and what I used to like and all that but I'm just not that guy anymore. I still have some of the same interests but dulled down so much idk if I'm really interested in them or just want to be because I used to be. And I'm definitely not happy. I'm sad sometimes but a large majority of the time I just don't feel anything at all. I'm just numb. I wake up and don't know what to do with myself, and mostly just wait for the day to be over and do it again. 


I just recently got a car again and started door dashing for cash because I'm kinda homeless rn, I'm staying on my sister's couch but that could end any day now. I'm 28 [m] I have 2 kids and I do love them very much but their mother left me when I relapsed again. I don't want to do drugs, I don't want to worry about being sick if I can't afford them I don't want any of the bullshit that comes with it but here I am. I know I've fucked up too many times I'll never have my family back together like I used to and always wanted, but anyways I'm kinda getting off track.


I can't go to rehab again, I can't afford it and have no where to leave my car. And also I am afraid that when I do quit I will have too many emotions, thoughts, memories, etc to deal with and no way to know how to deal with them, but then again last time I got sober I only really got emotional for a week or so and then was back to just barely existing. I have no family at all that I can lean on and no friends. My children's mother was my best friend and the only woman I ever really loved but she truly doesn't get anything about my disease. She thinks I just woke up and decided I'd rather be a junky than a father and husband and that I love the drugs more than them. I wish that were true sometimes. At least then it would make sense. I fucking hate these drugs. I don't even get high anymore doesn't even matter how much I do.


Also whether I get sober or not anytime soon I have no idea how to face all the problems I'm facing. My sister is bound to ask me to leave any day now, I literally have no one to call on or ask for help, I am completely alone now. So housing is a huge concern. My car has a few minor issues but im not sure what exactly they are or what they would cost to fix, I haven't even been able to afford insurance yet. I don't waste all my money on drugs either I just have been way too depressed to get a job let alone not actually having a way to get to one until I got the car a few days ago, and also my criminal background is not exactly blank, I've got a few Felonys and more than a few misdemeanor, cause obviously I'm a horrible, big bad druggie who needs to be kept from having a future.


I sell enough of my DOC rn that it pays for itself, maybe a few bucks thrown in here or there but I've slowed waaaaaaay down from IV over a G a day to snorting a line only when I'm getting sick and trying to make them smaller each time. But I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of not caring about anything. I hung out with someone I haven't seen in a long time the other day and I didn't really have anything to say, I listened to them but didn't really care what they had to say, I had no idea what we could even go and do, like what go drink? Ummm walk around a park? What do people like to do?

I want to keep going but this post is already way too long. I'm sorry for droning on. I feel like a waste of space and a waste of everyone's time. I think I might need therapy or a psychiatrist or something but idk how to even find one and get started with that.



TL;DR: I am tired of never feeling any real emotions and idk how to fix it. I'm in a very bad situation, homeless NO friends or family none at all and very little money, I want to be happy and normal but idk what that even is, idk who I am or what I like or want to do. Also idk what people do when they hang out together anymore, like wtf is there to really do? I can't afford rehab or put my car anywhere if I did.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8397082}"

It’s not a super big deal. I know I’ll fall asleep eventually. It’s just that it’s such a weird experience.  To feel high, but be completely clean. It makes me think back to my using days.

Reddit was one of the first places I felt comfortable being myself! The community on Reddit is always so welcoming, there’s always someone wanting to lend a hand. Long story short, I was a hard opiate addict for about 6ish years. I’ve now been clean/sober since thanksgiving of 2020 (don’t have a day count for various reasons). A few kind words or a random act of kindness can mean the difference between life or death for an addict. Again, THANK YOU ALL! I’ve been able to throw myself into other activities/hobbies that I’ve been ignoring for years. 

A few things that have helped me the most -
1. People - when I try to keep all my thoughts and emotions all bottled up inside, it eventually leads to me using. Sharing my story with others has GREATLY helped. 
2. Activities/hobbies/interests - I’m a huge gamer, always have been. I’ve thrown myself back into that and actually started what I believe will be a successful twitch stream, at some point. I’m also passionately into music and music creation. 
3. This one kinda goes back to people, but I’m actively in AA. I know it’s not for everyone, but it does it for me. The community involved in that is something that I crave. 

If there’s anyone out there who is still hurting, don’t be afraid to reach out. There’s lots of good people out there, who are willing to help when asked. I’m sending positive intent and good thoughts out for everyone as I’m typing. Everyone deserves to be happy!

I have been sober for almost 43 years now and never have I heard something so dangerous and crazy as the newish term California Sober. I guess it’s been around a couple of years but I just heard about it this week while reading an article about Demi Levado.I guess she now able to have an occasional drink or two now and a few other drugs....... in moderation. Moderation......
for a an addict?? Wow..... never heard of that concept before.

For me; from the very beginning to this day I have maintained my sobriety on a daily basis by choosing to not drink One Day at a Time since I first got sober at age 22 on June 18, 1978.
I take my sobriety very seriously. I have chosen to be willing to go to any lengths to maintain my sobriety. Heck... I still don’t use mouthwash with alcohol in it or use alcohol based hair products as I hate the smell of alcohol. I admit I am “anal” about my Recovery but it has been the only way for me. I cannot fathom having a drink and still saying I’m sober. One drink for me and I will be back to where I left off when I was 22. Probably worse since alcoholism is a progressive disease and we never get better..... only worse; once we step over that line into alcoholism.

I fear for Demi and anyone else who believes that they can somehow control their drinking, or drug addiction if they are truly an addict. Many people have tried and many of them have died in the process. Maybe not right away such as an overdose but still “dying day by day”...... a slow suicide. What is she thinking? She almost died of an overdose a few years back!

To anyone reading this, especially if you are new in Sobriety, do not think that you can try this at home and not have a problem having a “social drink”. If you are an alcoholic of my type that will not be possible. Don’t be influenced by the idea of having some control over your drinking or drug use if you have never been able to before.
