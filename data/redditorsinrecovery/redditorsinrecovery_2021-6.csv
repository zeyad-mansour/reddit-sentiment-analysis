Anyway just wanted to give a quick shout out to everyone sharing and supporting. This shits hard but knowing there are other people out there doing it as well makes me feel better. Also helps when feeling like I‚Äôm stranded. I love hearing about other people‚Äôs successes and it brings me encouragement every time.

Terror. Sweats. Paranoia. Regret. Remembering all the times you betrayed your morals. Remembering all the people you lost to the grave or lost because they couldn't put up with the harmful impact your DOC use had on their lives. Puking, shitting your pants, whilst still feeling constipation. Wanting to cry - SOB - in your loved ones arms but instead choosing to be amine, having all the curtains closed and the door locked whilst ignoring the real pleas for some form of notice that you're okay on your phone. Ignoring them regardless because your isolation had gone too deep by this point, and besides, how could they ever understand if you were to try and explain? Horror at the memory of events occurring from your own hands. Disbelief at who you've become. Grieving the potential you were always told you'd achieve. Realising the weeks, months and years wasted on these chemicals over your true passions and true loves.

Back to despair again. Hopelessness. And it repeats, sometimes 24/7. Some days are fine, then you're back here again.

It csn feel like using again is the only way to solve our problems. Our brains have been rewired so intensely that our reward systems are demanding us to destroy ourselves from the outside in, regardless of how logical and sound of mind one may be before the true impact of addiction strangled us into a never ending yet originally seductive choke hold.

Bullet points online listing ""Depression, anxiety, nausea, loose stools"" do nothing to fully capture the whole picture. We're stronger together, and addicts showing understanding, love and support to each other are all aspects of recovery that are all crucial to never having to experience the above hell ever again.

One day at a time.

For me, this just proves nothing in that circle has changed and they all think god is the ONLY answer.

When in fact AA/NA only is suitable for a small percentage of our population as many people these days do not believe in a higher power. The science behind the addict's brain has come a long way and there is real medical help these days.

No one needs to white knuckle through the process and cognitive therapy is an amazing tool but needs a professional to guide you through.

We have learnt so much about how the brain works and what we can do to change brain patterns and guys it really does work.

If AA/NA works for you that is great but the statistics prove it is by far not the only path to long term sobriety.

I hope everyone has a great straight day.",27,0

We agreed that there shouldn't be alcohol in the house, but he seems to believe that my program is stronger than it actually is. I get thirsty, damn it. And what's unfathomable to my alcoholic brain is that he won't drink it right away. So it just sits in the house and taunts me a bit. He's not an alcoholic, and I've brought it up before, but he'll still get it and let it sit around. I'd prefer that he at least drink it right away and rinse out the bottles so Im not tempted to try to taste it or anything.

I'd say half the groups I go to are OK with it, but the larger groups explicitly mention in the preamble time not to discuss drugs.

Am I missing something here? Is the obvious implication by these groups that drug addiction is somehow different than alcoholism?

Isn't the only reason these two are separate to begin with is because drugs weren't exactly mainstream in the 1930s like they are today? John Smith from pleasantville didnt exactly have the access or knowledge about hard drugs like John Smith does today, hence the AA big book not being inclusive of drugs.

I remember on the darkest days I'd read posts from people in sobriety who would talk about how amazing it was to watch the sunrise, or talk about how happy they felt just looking at the colour of flowers in their garden and being able to appreciate the small aspects of life like that.

But today. Today, I woke up at 6am, made myself a healthy breakfast of porridge (oatmeal for you folks across the pond!), blueberries, cranberries and guava. I went for a run as the sun glistened against my skin and was so taken aback by the newfound ability to appreciate the gorgeous  scenery (blessed to live in the Scottish Highlands!) around me. It might sound dramatic but I had to stop running for half a minute to wipe away the happy tears I felt at finally being able to appreciate everything life has to offer us at being able to accept contentment over euphoria and smile at the beauty of the nature around me.

Carried on my run, got home, meditated for 10 minutes and currently in my study room doing data analytics and market research on one of the businesses I own.

3 months ago I'd still be awake at 6am, praying for the birds to stop tweeting, cursing the sun for shoeing up and muttering expletives under my breath at anyone who DARED to have the nerve to be awake, functioning and *gasp* HAPPY TO BE UP AND AWAKE SO EARLY? THE NERVE!

I've still got a long way to go but my life has never been better since I hit adulthood, there's no drama, my bank account is my friend instead of my enemy and there's a sense of calm in the air instead of never ending horror and destruction.

I guess also the nerves of going on  a trip, which feels like a big deal to me.....give me slight Gollum vibes....MY PRECIOUS! Because its this exciting thing for me, I think I want to protect it from others, not risk telling people I don't know very well. 

Also this felt like a boundary cross to me to, because our one call back n fourth, and some texting is always checking in type stuff. This was just general chat about asking about my trip. maybe they are excited to, maybe they would like to be doing the same. So maybe its just that. 

But still I didn't feel good at all about it. Simply because I just wanted to share at the meeting tonight, and wasn't really ok with someone who was at that meeting , texting questions about my share, just because they saw it.

Posting today to let you know we are running a smart meeting in the RedditInRecovery discord! It happens every friday at 9pm central.

If you've ever thought that you need a meeting but you were scared to go in person, or you went to 12 step and it didn't fit with your mindset... I encourage you to check it out.

Here's a quick writeup of the program and how the meetings go:
SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training) Recovery

SMART is a generalized non-spiritual/non-religious addiction recovery program that is self-driven, as opposed to standard 12-step style programs, built from science-backed psycho-therapeutic techniques (e.g. CBT/DBT/REBT) that are applied in the context of addiction. 

The focus is to help and empower participants by building sensible mental tools as part of their recovery to overcome the logical fallacies, difficulties in emotional regulation and other mental roadblocks that appear during the path to recovery, no matter what stage someone is at (day 1 or day 1000).

The SMART approach is built around ""the 4-point program"":

1. Building and maintaining the motivation to change. 
2. Coping with urges to use.
3. Managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in an effective way without addictive behaviors. 
4. Living a balanced, positive, and healthy life.

 Meetings 

SMART meetings are best understood by looking at the meeting format. Unlike other programs, cross-talk (discussion between participants) is encouraged.

1. The meeting opens with a check-in where everyone one-by-one is invited to speak about how they are today, where they currently are in their recovery, any stressors they'd like to work on and anything else that feels relevant in the present.

2. The facilitator will ask people who are dealing with an issue to discuss it, generally inviting other participants to chime in if they have relevant experience or some thoughts, then work with the current person on teaching them (as well as the group as a whole) a tool that is applicable.

3. The meeting closes with a check out in a similar style to the check-in, where feedback is given to facilitator as well as simple how you feel and anything that may have come up that you want to ask about.

If you'd like to join us for the meeting tonight just click this link >> https://discord.gg/S3gEqnFw

I will be 3 years clean in october from various narcotics and I really cannot speak highly enough about how much the tools in smart helped me deal with intense urges and cravings along the way.

Hope to see you there!",8,0

I keep dabbling with NA meetings and do okay for a couple of weeks but boredom and not being happy just gets the best of me and I relapse again.

I‚Äôm at the point now where I need to do something, things are spiralling out of control again and this just isn‚Äôt working. 

I don‚Äôt know if I need to go back to rehab or what, I thought today maybe I need to be on medication like anti depressants/anti anxiety medication and that might help me feel more ‚Äònormal‚Äô sober?

I dropped out of college, I stayed in unhealthy relationships, and I struggled with substance abuse from ages 18-39 off and on. 

Now that I‚Äôve been sober and I reflect back on my life, I realize that while things were not easy, the experiences and knowledge I gained from my checkered past shaped me into the person I‚Äôve now become, as they do with everyone. 

Feeling shame, guilt, and regret for years never accomplished anything except for maybe casting a jaded view on what seemed like a hopeless, unfulfilling and dismal future. But now, I feel content. 

So taking risks at this point seems scary, maybe even absurd, but the risks I contemplate now are not unhealthy or destructive.

In my personal experience, that included adrenaline addiction-fueled negative behavior and lying. A couple months before I started by program, over a year ago, I had a spiritual experience with drugs that prompted me to stop using any type of drugs, including caffeine  and alcohol even. Before that experience, I was completely addicted to caffeine and I could feel my very addictive personality trying to attach itself to other drugs. Due to this spiritual experience, I did not experience any caffeine withdrawals unlike when I tried to previously quit. I entered into that agreement with myself that I would use drugs of any type only when I felt that it would be appropriate in my higher power's eyes. I'm not LDS, but the LDS idea that drugs such as caffeine are possibly okay on an individualized basis is something I agree with. 

Lately, I have been drinking small amounts of caffeine in an occasional black tea, or a small amount of chocolate covered coffee beans, because I felt like it was okay and that it was safe for me. I feel really good about that choice and I'm monitoring it. 

I recently broke up with my boyfriend a week and a half ago and it's been somewhat emotional for me, but not too bad. I am also transferring to a 4 year college soon. I'm experiencing cravings and intrusive thoughts, not only to do drugs, but also the fact that it's going to be hard in college with parties and such happening around me. My relationship with my higher power has changed a lot in recent times, because I felt forced by my now ex to be Christian, but I dont identify with any specific religion (yet.) Now I feel a lot freer to believe what I actually believe.

I dont really talk to my mentor/sponsor anymore, and I dont know what to do with myself. I don't feel like I have a support system to talk about these things but I'm really lost in my own head right now. 

I didn't go to a residential program for drugs at all, but in some way I feel like even taking a sip of alcohol could be considered a relapse or could lead to a relapse in my reckless behavior. I feel like I've been contemplating cheating on myself, if that makes sense. My relationship with my higher power is something I'm trying to re-develop right now.

I posted here a while ago celebrating a year clean off needles and 4 months off meth. I made it to 5 months off meth.

My brother died. I relapsed. My mother who is not a good influence and who I should have never contacted brought both over and I relapsed on both. My husband and my 2 year old went on the trip without me. He kicked me out, but I was able to come back inside because I'm still on the lease. When he comes back I will have to leave again.

I completed IOP before this and had been waiting on a counselor to transfer me to OP. outpatient.

I'm never gonna see my daughter or husband again. I do have family willing to take me in for a while.

Waking up today for the first time without my daughter is surreal. 

I'm sorry guys. I tried. All this hard work and now I have to restart. I hate needles. I hate meth. And I hate that my own mother enables me.

I love my husband but he took his ring off and hes divorcing me. I live in WA. 

any kind words are appreciated. sorry this is all over the place. i didnt get to go to my brothers funeral.",16,0

I dont feel like using or have i had thoughts or desires to use but I just want to escape myself and i dread night tine lately.

I feel my codependancy ramping up. There is a beautiful girl interested in me and my sponsor told me i cant date her until she gets a year, shes a little over 9 months right now. Im afraid she'll lose interest by then and girls who look like her aren't usually interested in me. Shes fun to talk to and i lied to my sponsor about continuing to talk to her.  Im going to be so pissed at my sponsor if she wants nothing to do with me in 3 months and im going to be sad that I let this oppurtunity go.

I got a new job and i dont know if it was the right move. Its my first time working 40 hours since ive been in recovery and i called about a place for rent today and im not making nearly enough to afford it so that made me sad. Im starting to feel like im not growing and that I cant stand how slow life is. Everything just feels like a chore, go to work, come home, go to work come home. I dont feel like using but sometimes i think i sure hope i dont live long and have to do this until im 70. 

Im scared of the unknown. Im scared of the possibility of not finding love or having the family or financial stability in life. My parents didnt tell me that this doesnt happen for everyone. 

I just need someone to tell me its gonna be ok because i just wanna cry and i want to run away. It feels like other people in my sponsorship family are doing good and sometimes i feel like i have no idea if im doing this right. Im tired of hearing its an inside job because im feeling like im not getting better and my fears arent going away. I dont have a strong relationship with god and im finding that part difficult. I try to pray and it feels like im talking to myself and that things dont change when i pray.

I feel like a fucking wreck and the feeling of impending doom wont leave. I hate being alone and i hate the hour before i fall asleep where im just in a dark room thinking. Its starting to feel like this program is working for everyone and im doing it wrong. Im beginning to lose hope of being happy because this just feels like a fucking chore. 

I feel so lonely. I want to find the woman i fall in love with and marry or at least have sex with people in the mean time but i have no confidence around women and despite people telling me i am good looking, i feel unable to relax and be ok around people. 

I dont know if i can do this, i dont want this empty feeling. Im almost done with my 4th step but the 2nd step says that people who pass over it with minimum concern find the following steps wont work and i dont feel confident with god. It feels like nothing happens when i pray. I dont feel anymore safe, things are still the same and god doesnt take away the fear or the thinking. How in the world do you have faith when you cant see things getting better or you pray but nothing changes? How am i suppose to have faith when things feel like they arent changing. 

Its like everyday feels the same and im in a tough situation not dating this girl because it feels so exciting to have her interested in me. If she loses interest then its just back to having no prospects and a boring life again.

Im a mess, its night time and i hate it. I wish i could sleep but i gotta lay here for an hour before i fall asleep. Im scared and im sad and this cant be all that life is. Fuck man it feels so fucking lonely sometimes =(

I dont know how to fix it or to stop feeling this way. My sponsor makes it sound so easy. He told me today what good does it do to worry about things and it doesnt do me any good but its not like i can just stop doing it. It keeps coming back.

Thanks for reading im just scared. If all life is is going to work 5 days a week and still not being able to support yourself and being alone then im not sure i really want to be alive. Sometimes i wish the ODs wouldve killed me. It just seems like it wouldve been easier.",10,0

I already consulted to my psychiatrist and we agreed to taper down to half a tablet of 0.5 mg (500 mcg) a day before sleeping.

---

I ran out of Alprazolam and took it as to how it was prescribed by my psych. I can't continue with taking it since anxiolytics are too expensive here in my country. 

I'm 23 M, I started taking it April 14, my last dose was June 19 and 500 mcg. I got diagnosed with Anxiety and Panic Disorder last March.

It's Day 2 of not taking it, and I don't know if I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I've been going to sleep with my mind racing with random thoughts. I can fall asleep after quite sometime but I'd always wake up and my brain does this ""constant checking"" if everything's alright. I'm waking up with my hands and feet feeling cold or light. My body sends me signals to wake up and I feel like it's gonna explode due to lots of energy. Basically I'm waking up feeling restless but my sleep doesn't feel satisfying.

My eyes would sometimes adjust and would suddenly become sensitive to light. Staring at my phone screen while typing this took several pauses as it adjusts to the light despite having it to the lowest brightness.

I'm having anxiety attacks to the roof too.

I already sent a text message to my psych regarding this matter, though I've read that suddenly not taking it would experience symptoms 24-48 hours.

I just wish to sleep normally and peacefully the same way when I'm having it. Thanks for reading.",21,0

I was recommended to a junior developer position by a friend who took pity on me and wanted to try and help me get a new position. He gave me a referral and I had my first interview. Unfortunately, I knew nothing about the coding language SQL that they use. The interviewer said I would be receiving a technical test to gauge my SQL knowledge and I'd have 5 days to complete it. 

So I started to cram. 8-12 hours for 3 days in a row. I finally reached a point where I said f*CK it and took the test....which I then proceeded to MURDER!!! 

I blew the test out of the water and nailed every question they threw my way. I was able to get exactly what they wanted for each question.

I bring this up not to brag (ok maybe a little :p ) but to encourage those out there who may be doubting their skill or intelligence to give it your best shot.

So I started craving every time I get an intense emotion like sadness or anger, I‚Äôd crave having a habit I knew would get rid of that physical emotion. 
 
Maybe a year in you get high on being sober I think. I was so happy to be experiencing emotions , so I sit with what I‚Äôm feeling and even the bad stuff. You really start to get to the bottom of why you started using , what‚Äôs wrong with you etc.

It‚Äôs now my two year mark, I now crave drugs when I‚Äôm bored. 

It‚Äôs like I know it‚Äôs a horrible choice, and I know that the circumstances that led to my addictions were bad. I dont want to repeat history, but a girl is hella bored sometimes.

I have been pushing myself everyday to do things.

Going to movies, going out to eat, going shopping for things I don‚Äôt even need, pampering myself, reading boring ass books, going on hikes or little nature walks, chilling with people sober, even finished my degree and got a job lined up but everything seems so dull.

I am happy and I am proud of myself, but I‚Äôm worried once you‚Äôve been high that often and for that long, nothing  else ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that you can do for fun will truly compare.

So I have been diagnosed ADHD by a doctor a long time ago as a kid. I used medications like Ritalin, concerta, strategy, and Provigil from primary school up to 3rd year university.

&#x200B;

I am about to be 2 years clean next month. My DOC's were Kat and Cocaine. I have abused Ritalin before but they were not my drug of choice. I only abused it when I didn't have access to my DOC.

&#x200B;

Long story short, there are moments where I feel my ADHD is crippling (mostly in situations that require concentration). There are moments where I feel like it's manageable. So I spoke with my sponsor and a few people in the rooms and decided to go to a psychiatrist. I was completely open and honest about my addiction and abuse. He said that I am definitely ADHD and prescribed me 30mg Ritalin LA.

&#x200B;

So I have decided to ask the most people positive about using Ritalin while in recovery. I am trying to make the most informed decisions possible. I also would like to find out what tools I can use to maintain honesty, refrain from abusing it, and what to do if there are adverse side effects.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your help guys!

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I think decisions like these are not just mine. They affect my family, my friends, and other loved ones. The very idea of 'what-if' scares those around me more than me. So, upon speaking with my family and getting numerous second opinions, I don't think I will take them. I think I would rather be working at 60% then dead, or repeat to my family what I put them through 2 years ago. Thank you guys for all your help and opinions. I appreciate it all. ",7,0

I've given it up just in case it could become problematic, but never had a craving for alcohol or anything. as such, I'm fine going to non-drug parties and bars, being around family drinking at dinner, etc.

But when my fianc√©e drinks, it makes me wanna have a drink with her. Or use. She's not really an addict but when depressed would drink 3-4 drinks 4 days a week. So there's an association. Is this fair to her?

edit: sorry all, left out crucial info. she currently doesn't drink much at all, about once a month and she'll have 2-4 drinks out with friends. At her peak she drank 3-4 times a week, up to 5 drinks a night, but that was a year and a half ago when she wasn't on a proper prozac dose yet. She's no alcoholic (yet..?).

Also, crucially, we're on vacation with my parents, who drink 1 drink at dinner each, every night (and have done so for decades lol). At the pool today my girl got upset that my parents had required her sobriety for the week at the beach. I realized I need to think more about her drinking at how it affects me. I haven't set a boundary with her like my parents did, but I have expressed that it's easier for me to stay sober when she does too.

Also, last crucial tidbit. When I first got sober (well, in recovery, not yet avoiding all alcohol), I had a Bday party at which i had a single drink. My girl had like 5 and made a comment in front of my parents like ""you're so much more fun when you're using!"" She regrets it and hasn't ever said anything like that since. It's one of the reasons she barely drinks ever anymore. But my parents want her to be sober this week around me on vacation because they're worried about her doing something like that again. Personally, I'm past that comment (it hurt me, but didn't cause a relapse or anything), but I still find it somewhat triggering to see her tipsy!",13,0

I'm considering rehab because a friend and a professor both suggested it might be good for me. I don't know what it would be like though, and whether it would be worth the cost (or even what the dollar sum would be).

Here's my situation. Right before lockdown started, in spring of 2020, I started drinking pretty seriously. Dropped it for the summer, did a little marijuana over the summer, and then when I went back to school I started using marijuana and drinking all the time, nearly every day. I got in trouble with campus police and was mandated to go to therapy, but I dropped it pretty quickly and nobody said anything. At the beginning of 2021, I started using kratom (because I knew it had an opioid like effect and I was curious) and got addicted to it. During that time I experimented with a bottle of hydrocodone. Then I got ""lucky"" and ended up with a jackpot of so much pharma codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone (and a little wine) that I stayed in an opium dream for at least a month. Honestly, my memory of the last couple months is super blurry. I would wake up from strange dreams and everything would feel totally unreal, like ""what's going on?"" and then I would just snort more pills and nod off again. I don't see myself ever mustering up the desire or the will to stop. But I can also tell this is leading to an overdose and I don't want to hurt my family.

Basically, would rehab help, or would it just drag out the end and make things worse by stressing my family out? They're going to find out eventually, but would it be better if they didn't remember me as an addict and I hid this from them up until the end?",34,1

I came from a background of alcoholism, dabbled in drugs throughout my teenage years, and ended up becoming a full blown drug addict.

A little about myself and my recovery beliefs. If you can't be fucked in short old long-term sober addict looking for like-minded online contacts. If you are ready for a long read please proceed....

I am 18yrs clean off heroin, 15yrs clean from benzos or any other rec drugs be they scripted or street. I am on the program and take a very small maintenance dose of biodone, pick up 6 TA once a week and only see a dr a few times a year plus communicate with DNA every few weeks. I do random urines a few times a year only as have not returned any positive for anything for over a decade.

In my honest opinion, no matter your beliefs until you and you alone take responsibility for your recovery and full credit for your victories you are going to be prone to relapse. WHY because your sobriety is tied to your faith and heaven forbid that your faith be rocked by some terrible event in your or a loved one's lives as there goes your coping mechanism to staying straight.

But I am not into witches etc either

I would love to meet some like-minded recovering addicts {with morals yet atheist} parents to talk with or similar I think if they were mature-aged noncity dwellers would be an added bonus also. That is just because having lived city/rural/outback and even community run outback I know just how vastly different the day-to-day is for a recovering addict in each of those environments and subsqeuent lifestyles..

Being an Australian middle agged{45} mum long term sober addict working my recovery living a rural married with kids lifestyle whilst trying to establish a new business I can find it very hard to find relatable allies/friends/associates within addiction recovery groups be it online or in-person frankly. We \[myself, my husband,18yr old son from a previous relationship, our 6yr old daughter and 18mth mummas boy plus my lifelong best friend/chosen sister}live in a family-owned home on a few ac where we are establishing a horse agistment/breeding center and hoping to add transport to our services offered in the very near future also. We are also already working on our future plans on branching out to growing our own veggies/fruit and having produce markets.

So, does anyone have any ideas for me, do not be shy please share them with me. Even better please introduce yourself if you think we might have any common ground outside of our past drug use.  My personal interests include child/teen phycology and welfare, breeding rare animals and studying the genetics behind them, becoming more self-sufficient by growing and producing more of our own foods, using more solar/wind and gas generated power supplies, and am very interested in investing in miniature dairy goats. Also, have a strong passion for humanity in general, and in particular, the generational system failure tieing our indigenous plus our underprivileged{often critically under educated} be they Australian born or new immigrants into substandard pockets of hellish housing communities where the outcomes are very dire and very well known to our government yet these travesties are just getting worse and worse.

Tell me about why you find it hard to find your tribe also even if you have no hints or help on my search. At large we all seem to suffer from a feeling of not belonging and of not being accepted by those that matter or society at large and it leaves us trying to fill the void of acceptance/community/family/stability with negative behaviors like drug use and other self-harming activities. I strongly feel finding that place of belonging and a tribe to call our own is the most healing positive thing for an addict in recovery to find.

And even though I didn‚Äôt know it I wanted to be clean I knew that going there was my opportunity to 1 live out in Cali: and 2. Not return to the bullshit that had become in Missouri .

I did SL for a few months and then got a place with a friend from there. I know have 2 jobs I love and yes I don‚Äôt as much as I did when I was stripping BUT I‚Äôm happy. I have my dog back and am a good dog mom. I do NA, I found a super rad lady with21 years as my sponsor and she takes me through the steps: without these I would not be where I am today. Today I believe there‚Äôs a power greater than me out there working in my life because I‚Äôm fucking walking miracle. All I gotta say is life is good today not near perfect shit still can suck: I‚Äôve lost friends one very close (died) while clean, I found out I have skin cancer, I ended a 3 year relationship all clean. And the only way I don‚Äôt lose my mind today and can still genuinely feel growth and happiness is because I‚Äôm clean: thanks for listening to my rant hope this inspired someone.",69,0

I haven't posted here much previously but, awesome sub. I have had a long term severe alcohol issue I am trying to structure my life to crack.

I have been in hospital recently for over a month recovering from a psychotic episode, due to be discharged in maybe a week and a half. 

So I'm intending to start cleaning my own place this afternoon, in preparation for returning and also for a support meeting later in the afternoon. A big problem trigger for me is lack of structure, difficulty with prioritisation or task overwhelm, related to autism spectrum disorder. I am hoping to stay straight this afternoon and set a good precident for myself. Using a good set of chilled out tracks to clean to, and starting small (hall and bathroom first, to a plan). Picking up 3 things and binning, repeat, decluttering 3 items in these important entry spaces if only to hide them elsewhere, sweeping the floor in sections.

I've decided not to obsess over alcohol and just do one task first, one task first, another task first in the timeframe, to keep it just a step out of my way and attention :-)

Thanks for listening to my healthy intention.",41,0

here's a note I found in my phone from back when I was heavily abusing dxm and diphenhydramine. I feel this note reflected a lot on my mental state and negative outlook back then. looking back on it now, boy was I wrong. there was a way back after all, I just made it harder for myself to get back. I'm doing way better now and I'm really glad I'm out of the dark place I was in back then. Abusing diphenhydramine and dxm is one thing, doing it every day for months on end is another. i became so enthralled by this horrible compound I fell out of touch with the world around me. and more importantly, with myself. that me is gone, who he was or where he went ill never know. i was able to quit and since then iv been on a journey to find myself and rebuild from where i am no. aside from a couple shitty long term side effects I'm doing pretty good.  anyways, just wanted to share cause it means something to me, and came from my dark times.

safe travels everyone.

**The note:**

This is what happens when demons, fight their demons,

When the dragon slays the king.

Or when the fly catches the frog.

Life continues to unfold as a paradox.

A contradiction.

As I barrel forward completely out of my own control.

all whilst i have full control of myself.

Everything I see just gets more twisted and demented.

There's no way back No matter how hard you look.

you will never find it.

and the more you look, the harder you strain yourself to reach your arm further down that hole The deeper the vessel containing the world your fighting to bring to reality sinks.

I am no longer the captain of this ship More so a prisoner or deckhand.

And that's okay, I'm giving in.

They can take my body I sent my mind to sail on a separate ship.

Sorry, I'm all over the place and I hope this makes sense .


I have been clean from IV heroin and cocaine for almost 5 years and every part of me misses using lately.  I miss the needle so much, I miss my exciting former life, and I miss being skinny. (Crazy how all of the bad stuff has been forgotten huh)

I was only able to get clean when I started taking methadone in 2016 and I'm about halfway through the loooong process of tapering off of that.

I don't have any friends that use.  I actually have been isolating for about 6 months and ignore messages from everyone that cares about me. I married a wonderful man that doesn't use and I had my first child about 15 months after I quit.  I just feel like I'm stuck and bored and miserable.  I have no libido thanks to the methadone and my marriage is suffering tremendously because of it.  

Doea anyone else ever feel like a fraud in their sobriety?

I'm now a mother of 2 tiny little humans and they need me to be okay.  I feel like the biggest piece of garbage when I have dirty dishes in the sink so there is no way that I could relapse and not let the guilt destroy me.   I just feel like the biggest loser and I keep thinking about how the sober mom version of myself is n impostor.  Like, the person that I am supposed to be is the strung out homeless shell that I was, not this stay at home mom that reads Goodnight Moon 5 times in a row.

I was never good enough for my parents and even though I limit contact with them I feel like I'm not good enough in my life now.  My husband and I share a vehicle, a small little car because money is tight (he's a paramedic) and I worry that I am a bad parent because we are all cramped.  Our credit isn't the best so we live in an apartment and I worry that they'll resent me because they don't have a yard to play in.  

In reality......

I'm a pretty good mom who is loving, affectionate, and stable.  I love my husband (even though I can't physically show it) and I wouldn't jeopardize my family by getting high again.  But....why can't I just be okay?  Why do I feel like I'm just not supposed to be who I am right now?",17,0

My drinking really bothers her and no wonder. I never did anything violent to her while drunk, but we have had too many arguments and she has lost too many Saturdays because of my drinking and subsequent hungovers.

She knows all about the steps I've been taking for almost two years to quit or at least cut down: I've seen two different therapists and one psychiatrist, have been on antidepressants, have read one book about alcohol and plenty of support posts here on Reddit to help me quit. The longest I managed to stay sober was just short of 90 days.

Yet she doesn't see it as a battle I'm fighting against a force that sometimes just overpowers me. She sees it as me deliberately choosing to drink and not giving a damn about her. I understand how it comes across that way, but I've opened up to her many times admitting that I have a problem and I WANT to fix it -- I wish she were a bit more understanding and sympathetic.

For instance, I don't think she ever congratulated me on staying sober for several weeks whenever I managed to. I think she just assumed that to be normal, but as all of you know, fighting a drinking problem rarely feels ""normal"", certainly not in the first few weeks.

Sometimes I feel like the pressure to not relapse and the stigma I get from her if I do just makes me feel more miserable. I strongly believe that if I had her support my journey to sobriety would feel easier and much more meaningful.

Been recovering from opiates since I was 16 and the cravings have always come and gone and sometimes I remind myself what withdrawal was like, then I think about it so often that it almost feels like its happening but the craving always come back (is that normal?). This itch felt so out of hand that I ended up in a crisis center last year- received a diagnosis/meds/therapy n all that good stuff but I didn't relapse. Treatment has been good, things have been good, even found the courage to get into a relationship. I thought since things were getting better that I would 'grow' out of it. Which sounds so stupid now that I'm typing it.

To cut the blah in half, I was talking to my boyfriend earlier this week, I knew that he did some occasional drug using in the past and he was talking about how he had done some coke just the other day. We had this whole talk about how comfortable I was in terms of people around me using and I've always just taken a step back from people who use just in case. Now I don't understand what's wrong with me but the craving is so strong I think I'm going to cave. Been going over where I could get how much I should get what'll happen to me how much I need it and I feel so desperate I feel like crying. 

I  don't know who to talk to. Got clean pretty privately, no one really knew how bad I got or what I did when I used or how far I took it. I've opened up about it to close friends who suspected but couldn't ask and my boyfriend. Was very vague about it though and now I feel so alone and desperate I don't know what to do. I can't talk to my friends because they're in the middle of doing great things that they shouldn't be distracted from and the topic would be potentially triggering for one and my relationship is so new I don't want to fuck it up. I need help. what do I do? what's wrong with me. I don't want to talk about it in therapy because all they've been saying is how much progress I've made and I don't want to talk about it I don't want people to look at me the way they do when I talk about my problem. help please i've been doing anything I could to distract my head but it won't pass. I just don't know what to do or who to talk to if talking would even help Ifeel so fucking hopeless it's crazy. I feel like a failure. 5 years and Im about to fuck it all up i feel it

My mind has been racing with the events of last summer, and everything that led up to me quitting on August 11. Where did they go sideways? When did I see alcohol is my only salvation of the day? Why didn‚Äôt others see it and help me? That‚Äôs been a big question that I keep going back to. Because my shit show was on display for everybody. Have we just gotten so numb to the impact alcohol has like us that everybody is given a pass when they act like an idiot drinking? 

The people in my life internalized my mistakes  to be about them, rather than stop and notice me. That is what caused the demise of my relationship. I didn‚Äôt break his heart because of my outrageous actions in July. I broke his heart because he thought my actions were purposely disregarding of him. He didn‚Äôt understand that my actions were all about the alcohol and the impact it was having on me emotionally. I was no longer being able to drink and hold everything together. Problems with alcohol progress and get worse before they get better. They were times that I drove when I shouldn‚Äôt have. There were things that I forgot to do or places where I needed to be and show up for people, and I didn‚Äôt. Never wear any of these intentional. I don‚Äôt know if I know how to be intentionally hurtful. That has put me in bad positions many times. My mom wants said to me, ‚ÄúYou need to become more of a bitc, sometimes, Cathy.‚Äù To this day, I still can‚Äôt be mean. One of the four agreements is: ‚Äúit‚Äôs never about yiu.‚Äù None of my actions were meant to hurt others. There are people in my life who think I set out to purposely be hurtful or disregarding. I‚Äôm not removing the impact I had. But, not once, did I ever say, ‚ÄúNope. I‚Äôm not going to wake up and I am going to purposely blow you off.‚Äù Very rarely is that ever the case. This goes back ti the post I wrote last week about giving more space as a teacher. Rarely, do I have students come in and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna cause some shit today.‚Äù They‚Äôre hurting, or not loved at home, or scared. Something is going on behind those actions. No one ever looked at me and my life and asked, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚ÄùNo one ever said, ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù If you know someone who is sliding, ask! Get curious as to why things are happening. Let them know they are not alone. I was the one who stopped. I knew my life couldnt go on that way. I did it by myself. No one should ever have to feel as alone and fucked up as I did in August. This is why I write. I hope it helps.",3,0

About a week after the incident I was already beginning to feel somewhat better, though it was clear to me something was still off. I knew I had to stop the Vyvanse at least temporarily‚Äîmine was prescribed not for ADHD but for chronic fatigue following mononucleosis‚Äîbut I thought whatever damage I had done would heal relatively quickly and that I could restart the medicine‚Äîwithout which the fatigue is staggering‚Äîafter a few months.

What little I knew! The apparent recovery I experienced a week after my overdose and lasting for about a month in all seems to have been what is called the ‚Äúpink cloud,‚Äù a temporary bubble of well-being and optimism before the post-acute withdrawals kick in. What‚Äôs difficult about my case is that I felt better during the pink cloud than I do today after a year of sobriety. I think I am in somewhat uncharted medical territory: on the one hand, my symptoms are worse than they were before the overdose, so that certainly played a part in how I feel now, but on the other hand, people who abuse harder drugs at greater doses and for longer periods of time seem to recover faster than I have so far. My working theory is that the post-viral syndrome (which seems to be partly neurological) and the overdose (which definitely pissed off my brain) inflicted damage synergistically so that what I‚Äôm experiencing now is worse than the sum of the symptoms of each of those events. In short, my brain is ultra fucked up.

Lately I‚Äôve been treading in a shallow pool of relative emotional stability, which has afforded me the ability to have a good laugh at my early-sobriety self. What visions I had of where I‚Äôd be by now! I was positively intoxicated by the idea of sobriety. I‚Äôd become my best self, better than any version of myself before. I‚Äôd work out, get barrel-keg arms and diamond-hard abs, and run‚Äîno, *sprint*‚Äîmiles every day. And even though my brain was fried, I‚Äôd read and study and learn languages and play piano: hell, I‚Äôd publish essays about recovery and discover some new groundbreaking treatment myself. And all those interpersonal problems that so many of us addicts have? Those would be a thing of the past, and I‚Äôd be more popular than ever. Finally, I believed, some true, complete version of myself would emerge from its infinity of cocoons, and everyone would recognize and love the real me. Everyone I ever felt neglected or misjudged or wronged by would spontaneously call me up and say, ‚ÄúHey, you know what, Billy? I did you dirty, and I‚Äôm sorry, and what‚Äôs more, I think you‚Äôre really awesome. Cheers to you, dude.‚Äù Some orchestral music would play, the credits would roll, and I would be fully recovered at long last.

What a na√Øve child! Dear Billy-from-June-2020, son, you‚Äôre in for some ugly shit. At least once a week for at least the next year, you‚Äôre going to feel like you‚Äôre positively dying, like your brain is just shutting down, going dark. Instead of getting fit you will get fat, or at least fatter than you‚Äôve ever been. In the next year you‚Äôll read less than you ever have in your entire adult life. You‚Äôll neglect responsibilities, you‚Äôll neglect friends. You will unlearn the ability to feel joy or interest. You‚Äôll spend entire weeks weighing the pros and ~~cons~~ additional pros of suicide. Music will become a succession of unwelcome sounds; the touch of your lover will be like cold lifeless sandpaper. Some days even the act of imagining will be too strenuous. All the parts of yourself you consider the most human will be reduced to a minimum.

The worst of all that horse-shit is, I think, over, but I have fewer expectations now than I used to about my long-term prospects for recovery. In another year I may feel slightly better or significantly better; neither will surprise me. It‚Äôs tempting of course to try to draw some lesson from what happened, to convince myself that what I‚Äôve suffered was in some way ennobling.

If I learned anything it is this: if you lose your health, your friends, your future, your happiness, your self-respect, your hope‚Äîin short, if you lose all those aggregates of living except life itself‚Äîthen you‚Äôre left with the rare opportunity to see who you are at your core. When you lose everything you are left with nothing but yourself and so unlike the vast majority of blessedly undamaged people you will have a solid answer to the question ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù.

I‚Äôm still not sure having that knowledge is worth sitting through the lesson though.",13,1
