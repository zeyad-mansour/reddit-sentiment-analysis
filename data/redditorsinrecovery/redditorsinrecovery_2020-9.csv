Regret drinking. Vow to not drink. Get to about 36-40 hours and cave. Drink. Regret drinking. Around that 36 hour mark, the drive and motivation to stay sober completely dissolves and suddenly I'm just ""having a few drinks,"" which leads to cigarettes and cocaine. Shitty sleep. Sleep 10 hours the next night and feel great, then head out and start the cycle all over again. I'm so sick of belittling my desire and need to stay sober as the hours pass, and that's exactly what happens... My mind shifts from ""I really have to do this,"" to ""Meh. It's not a big deal. Go have a few."" By the way - ""few"" is typically between 8-10 units in a night.   


PLEASE give me advice for just getting to 100 hours sober. Even just 60 feels like a massive accomplishment at this point. Let's start there.

Im starting to think/realize that people go through these programs because they were messed up needed help, and it’s not necessarily a place to make good friends. I’m sober now and am always willing to help out those friends to help them stay on a healthy track, but I recently reconnected with a friend from rehab that still uses and I started losing a grip of myself.

I’ve already started to take a few unnecessarily and I’m not blaming it on him but I feel like it triggered me because I am so close to him.

Friday was the first day at work where I took the initiative and could see my self preparing for what’s next teaching instead of just reacting to what needs to be done. My job had become a series of task because I could complete tasks. I had not thought beyond the day to day at all this school year. The most I could do was plan for the day ahead.

Friday I began to formulate what the next 8 weeks could look like. I formulated what teaching hybrid in two weeks could look like. I’m learning it’s amazing when you get sleep and what that does for the brain. I reached out to people. My conversation did not revolve around my sobriety. Finally, my lens was a little bigger.

I posted my last blog on my sober mommy pages and the support I received was overwhelmingly in support of my accomplishment and that I needed help. I hired a cleaning lady for Sunday. Yep. Come 8:30a I’ve got to find somewhere else to be because my house is getting cleaned. Woohoo!

The other thing I have done is start seeing a counselor. My alcohol counselor is next week. This is just a counselor. He talked about my drinking as my attempt to regulate because I had never been taught those skills as a child. Drinking gave me that self soothing. Which makes sense why I was so protective over that mommy time. Next steps – learn to self sooth.

I still have a hard time maintaining attention. I’m very distracted and create distraction. I’m in a meeting and I flip to FB to read or look for responses to my posts or comments. I have like five books going right now, and I discovered podcasts. And I have all that work I talked about before.

Tomorrow – I need to straighten up my disaster if a house to manageable before the cleaning lady gets here. Has anyone else cleaned before a cleaning lady came? Asking for a friend.",1
2020-09-26 03:20:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/j01kvj/another_demon_of_recovery_fits_of_shame/,Another Demon of Recovery: Fits of Shame,"I’m in recovery from three different substances. If I’m honest with myself, the first signs I would eventually have problems with alcohol started as early as eighteen, though the “problem drinking” didn’t really start until I was about twenty-three, and ramped up hard from twenty-four through twenty-eight (with fits of relapse for the four years thereafter). My problems with Vyvanse only lasted from last September through this May. The final Vyvanse binge that threw me into the emergency room coincided with heavy marijuana use, though I never really had a “marijuana phase.”

The real point is that I’ve had a bad relationship with substances for over a decade now (I’m thirty-two), and I’m realizing that it was right around the time I started developing those problems that my life started going to shit, at first slowly, and then faster and faster. I can’t tell you the number of people I’ve alienated over the past decade. At every turn I told myself that it was them, that somehow, through some insane statistical anomaly, I simply got wronged, betrayed, or abandoned by person after person, and that I was more or less always in the right.

One of the ugliest psychological aspects of recovery, I’m learning, is having to entertain seriously the idea that if there was an exodus of important people from my life, and if I’ve had such a hard time making deep connections in the past years, the problem has probably been me.

One difficulty is that I can never determine in what proportion the things I’ve done in the past decade were a result of the substance abuse and in what proportion they were just representations of what an ugly person I can be. And really: very few of us became addicts because we were happy and self-confident and well loved to begin with. What if I’m just kind of an asshole?

Cause and effect gets tricky here. Life gets hard so you abuse substances and then abusing substances makes life harder. You alienate people by doing stupid things when you’re hurt or high and then you do more stupid things because you’re hurt or high because you’ve been alienated.

Honestly, I really do still think there are times I was wronged, seriously wronged in the past decade. I have a lot of pent up anger and indignation that I have no real outlet for. People saw I was hurting and kicked me when I was down—people, no less, who flatter themselves that they’re good and caring and charitable, but who turn tail the second you become a liability.

But even though I’m quite certain I was wronged in some instances, I more or less have to accept that if my substance abuse had even the tiniest part in what happened, then I have to take responsibility. I simply can’t ignore the fact I started getting drastically less popular around the time I started drinking and experimenting with other substances.

The social aspect of recovery is also difficult. Now more than ever I need social support, but a lot of people don’t extend to addicts the charity they might extend to people going through other struggles. Shame really does adhere strongly to addiction, and I’m staggered by how powerful that feeling can be. I can hardly concentrate sometimes I’m so overwhelmed by unwanted memories of things I did and by how I imagine others feel about me. My day is a marathon of imaginary arguments with people I haven’t seen in years.

My current attitude is that my next few years may simply not be that enjoyable and that I should just look forward to having my health back, getting my finances in order, and slowly rebuilding a social life. I regret not having been more forward-looking in high school, for instance. I was an awkward gay kid; if I had just worked hard and told myself that my real life would start when I turned eighteen, then I could have done my undergrad at a university where I fit in better, and people probably would have respected me more for working hard rather than trying desperately to be liked.

Now, I’m telling myself, it’s the same: I’m not going to attract anyone by saying, “Hey, I know I was an asshole for the past decade, but I’m sober now, so please pretend that everything I did was the result of the substances and that I’m actually a newborn angel.” I’m trying to keep faith that if I work hard, stay sober, play the long game, and pull my head out of my ass, the universe might fling some nice things my way.",17

Called my mom. Told her that giving sis perscription meds is NOT ok. Thankfully, it turned out that mom had mixed up oxycontane with oxascand, so it's ""just""**'benzo** that she'd given my sis. After a bit of discussion and my mom getting pissed off with me, I think I convinced her to have my sis call the rehab clinic she was an inpatient in and put them on speaker and ask about it. Not sure if they will, but I can't find the energy to argue anymore. Not with my mom defending my sister and not with my sister constantly coming up with excuses and refusing to deal with her traumas.

**EDIT 2**

Well, this escalated. Sister got hysterical over me ""being mean to mom"" for saying that it wasn't ok and that they should speak to the rehab together. Then she accused me of being a pill addict and that's why I said something (have endometriosis. Have been on heavy pain meds during flare ups, but always only on the regime the endo specialist in combination with pain specialist has suggested and no meds between flare ups). I've long felt that this relationship isn't healthy for me and that it takes more than what I can give and more than what I get in return. So I told her, I can't be her codependent anylonger, that when she decides to deal with her traumas and find healthy coping strategies I'll be there to help, but until then I'm taking a break from this. So this lost me a sister and probably limits contact with my dying parents. I don't get how I could have kept quiet though. F*ck all of this.



**OP**
So my sister is an alcoholic. She's been dry since x-mas, but relapsed Friday. 

 She had apparently asked my cancer sick mom for oxcycontane to help with the alcohol cravings yesterday. My well meaning and codependent elderly mother gave my sister oxy. I honestly don't know what to do or say in this. Aside from it being highly illegal,  giving an alcoholic morphine to help with the other substanse abuse does not seem like the way to go.  Am I missing something here? Is there anyone benefits at all or is it as bad as i think it is? Please help.",9

My mom was the one that got the worse of it. It wasn’t until one night my dad tried to pick up a potted plant that was in the living room and try to throw it towards my mom that my two older brothers got in the way and called the cops. That would be the first time my dad landed a alcohol related charge. My mom left my dad for a short time. This would leave us to move around a lot. My school record holds four elementary schools, three middle schools and three high schools. We never made friends for long. So my brothers and I were pretty close. With my dad out of the picture my mom was always at work trying to provide for my brothers and I. One of my brothers got diagnosed with cancer so we eventually had to move back in with my dad. That lasted a couple of years until my brothers and I had enough of him and told mom “enough was enough”. 

I believe that watching my dads actions toward my mom held me back from drinking until my high school graduation. It was the summer after graduation that my drinking career would begin. I was 19. It was not until recently that I noticed that I had a problem. When I think of a “alcoholic” I use to believe that it was someone’s who would drink from the moment they woke up until they pass out. I had a schedule for drinking. Holidays, parties, work gatherings. Those were my excuses and passes for drinking. It started to become more of thing when I started working in kitchens. If we had a perfect night at work with hitting our goal we would have a “safety meeting”. A safety meeting is when we all take a shot of the cheapest thing we have behind the bar. I work at a successful restaurant so it happens often. The night of my dui I was leaving work. It was 1am and I blacked out after my first drink. I don’t know how much I drank that night but according to my arrest record it was enough for me to blow a .248 and a .246. I’m 5’6 and weigh 115 pounds so I can imagine it was a lot. That was the one night I should not have gone out because I had to be up early in the morning to visit my best friend that was losing his life to cancer. I woke up in the drunk tank with no socks on thinking I really messed up. The lady cop came up to me to let me know that I wrecked my vehicle and that I was in the middle of being bonded out on a DUI charge. The only words that I could say back to her was “did I kill anyone?” Thankfully I had only ruined my own life that night. When I was bonded out I was able to charge my phone to check on my friend Alex. I had learned that he had passed away from his sister that I should have been with that morning. My selfish act had caused me that last goodbye. On top of Alex’s passing my boyfriend of 8 and a half years sister gave birth to her first child. I understand when people say they regret getting behind the wheel because it has caused them so much time and money. I lost a lot more that night. Ive learned a lot over the last year and a half. Between the classes and all the other things I’ve had to accomplish to close this chapter in my life I’m great full for all of it. It has left me scared of what my future could become if I continued the life that I was living. This has taught me about myself and surroundings. What and who I want to surround myself with. I lost a lot of friends at the beginning of this. But the more I change myself I see that group of friends becoming more and more small. And I’m okay with that because it just shows that we are not in the same place in life. I’m being more mindful of my body. Ive been able to take all my free time and turn it into something useful. On my spare time I currently garden and learning how to do yoga even though it hurts. I replace safety meetings with wheat grass and ginger shots. Which also hurt. But not in the ways that I was hurting myself before.",36

\--------------------------

I'm late, but I knew this was coming. Let's talk challenges.   


I was warned that life outside of rehab would be difficult. Person, place, and things were repeated over and over. I took it with a grain of salt simply because recovery is different for everyone and I felt comfortable where I was, where I was heading, and where I wanted to be and I was pretty much right. I enveloped myself into different recovery subreddits, found a recovery discord, kept going to meetings, etc. etc. I knew what I wanted and there was nothing that was going to stop me. Craving wise, I had none and that continues because I look at my sobriety logically and with a balanced mental health; if I drink or smoke weed, this happens and I don't want this to happen again, so I'm not. It seems simple, but that's just how it works for me. Even in the beginning when I thought ""Wow, I can't drink EVER again. I feel like I can do one."" but then I immediately think ""Ok...when has one drink EVER happened?????????"" So there goes that dream.  


But life is funny. In one week, I experienced so much. On Labor Day,  a friend I met at the rehab I went to was killed. She was living her sober life to the fullest; community service, sober living house, etc. She was doing what she needed because she wanted to assure she stayed in her kids life. It crushes me to think about because she was where she wanted to be. You could hear her laugh from the other side of the campus, it was boisterous and joyful. She smiled at everything, even when the candy she had just ordered was stolen and she shared the rest with everyone and even more so when she realized the ""stolen"" candy was actually put away in her bag (she shared that too lol). Her smile was dazzling and that smile reverberated through her whole body and you couldn't help but smile too. I wish I had answered her message she sent the day before she died. There's so many ""I wish"" honestly. It just sucked.  


I continued on with my week and I decided to reach out to a friend I hadn't spoken to since everything happened and I ended up going to rehab. We spoke for a few minutes and then he says ""I'm not supposed to say anything, but in a few days a statement is coming out."" and I freaked out, I don't want to get into it yet and I'm not sure if I will in this reddit, but that sentence meant something totally different for me and I was confused. He kept asking if I was actively seeing a therapist  and I'm like yes and he said it's really, really, really bad news and I'm literally shaking at this point. Finally, he pulls me and a mutual friend into a Discord call and the news is dropped on me; a good friend of ours has died. Someone I had known and hung out with at different gaming events and discord for the past 4 years was just gone. I think that was the first time they ever heard me break down. It was at that moment, I was close to snapping. Instead of giving in to anything, I immediately called my recovery coach and talked to her for an hour. I talked about it in group therapy and I also isolated cause I just needed space.   


I'm in a better place than  I was last week, but it was just one thing after another and I'm proud of how I handled it. I realize that without any challenge there's possibility of complacency and relapse. These challenges remind me of what I want and that was to 1) actually FEEL my emotions 2) process them and 3) cope in a healthy manner and I think I did all of that. There's no gain without pain right??? I just didn't realize it'd be that much.",6

I just typed it, standing in the dark of my living room. But I'm reposting it here because its true. There are maggots underneath.

I've been a drug addict for over half my life and Im only 30. Im still on suboxone. That almost feels irrelevant though as I work my way through the rooms and I start to come apart at the seams and then watch as everything I thought I was has been dismantled and shattered. 

My biggest thing has been that I'm a good mom. Its been easy to delude myself this way because I am a hermit with my three year old. Coming into the rooms and seeing how those kids there behave versus mine own had me questioning -- what am i doing wrong? And I've chewed on that for the past couple weeks. Last week my therapist helped me to understand I am failing my eldest daughter, who is six, because I am not there. I let her dad and his family completely take over and basically bowed out because it was easier than being a referee to two little kids. *easier*. *shittier*.

Tonight, before my meeting, i started to work out in my journal that I've failed my other little one too because I do not make time for her even when she begs me. Im too busy reading and smoking cigarettes in the backyard to parent her. Its *easier*, *shittier*, to throw food at her or throw YouTube on so i can keep reading my book in peace. This has gone on for months. Tonight i shared this in the meeting and fleshed it out a bit more and found myself breaking down as the reality of my actions toward my kids came crashing down on my head.

No, i haven't done horrific things. But i make them hurt. *I* do that. They have not been my priority. Not when i was using and not now that I'm clean and want to escape reality through books.

It hurts, guys. Everything I thought i knew about myself is just falling away. Ive never seen myself with such clarity and *they arent even done yet.* i haven't started the steps! I'll have only 30 days on Thursday clean from meth after a couple months' bender that nearly cost me my youngest child-- my only family is my children. I've been disowned by the rest.

Its going to get harder from here, I'm sure, as i navigate learning to parent and be a decent person. But i thought I'd share for anyone who doesn't use NA or AA. I resisted for a long time. Im an atheist, after all. But my god fearing sponsor told me to make the universe my higher power.

Go to a few meetings. Maybe you'll have the same revelations i have been. Maybe you wont. But it feels good to have people give me a hug when i openly say im a bad mother instead of agreeing with me.",36

This time it's been about 8 years, and in a matter of 2 months she cut all her hair off with scissors, lost tons of weight (she's like a beanpole now), her face has aged like 10 years super wrinkly, she started smoking again after stopping 10 years ago, she's very twitchy and itchy and eyes rapidly moving and she is constantly saying something and then saying something contradicting it 5 seconds later.

Well, my son (10 years old) idolizes his nana and he's noticed that there is something wrong and being the smart kid he is, realized that this is all the signs of drug use and came to me sobbing yesterday. So I finally intervened.

I reached out told her I know what's going on and it's ok I'm here to help but our son is very worried about her and she in turn is blaming her last couple of months of weirdness on her hitting her head. I tried to point out that hitting her head has nothing to do with the all of a sudden being best friends with the neighbors she's hanging out with that just last year she told me were bad news and very heavy drug users. Doesn't explain the extreme aging and other symptoms and the fact that she hit her  head two weeks ago and she's been showing these symptoms for months now.

She's still denying everything and that the Dr. can explain her failed drug test. I told her I'd be happy to talk to her doctor but I'm not sure how to handle this moving forward usually dad was the one to handle her relapses but he passed away 3 years ago. I'm very worried, and just want to help but also how to I explain this to my son that's basically figured out the situation already?

Edit : The drug test she failed was for Meth if that helps.  


Edit 2: I had to pick my mother up from the back of a squad car at 3 AM this morning. She said she was asleep and was in a lot of pain so she called 911 and they rushed her to a hospital, they checked her over, saw nothing was wrong and let her go with a pain patch of some sort. She tried calling me for a ride but my phone was on silent and I was asleep, she then yelled at the hospital for not giving her a ride which net her a stay in the back of a squad car until she calmed down and I woke up and saw all the missed calls.   


This is hard for me but I'm taking the great advice you gave all gave me here. I know she's doing drugs, she knows I know she's doing drugs, and I'm going to keep my distance but be supportive and there for her for when she's ready to kick it. ",24

she's about one of the only people I talk to though. I get paid Tuesday, and I so badly wanna just use one time. honestly because she used while I was in treatment this past May. isn't that stupid? I'm not even mad about it, I guess my motivation is I want to misbehave. I view her using while I was in treatment as a choice for her, but I know rationally it wasn't. she would have wanted more than anything to be clean if she had the tools and means to do so.

I'm past the physical withdrawals, but mentally it eats at me. I'm already SO broke, SO behind on bills and shit that I don't care about another penniless week.

2020-09-19 20:19:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/iw3smi/off_prescribed_med_and_feel_free_at_last/,Off prescribed med and feel free at last!,"Just to preface: I’ve been clean off my DOC (opiates) and all mind altering substances for awhile now. I walked into the rooms on my own (the law didn’t force me, nobody said I had to, i didn’t know what to do) back in January 2019. I was tired of being dopesick and willing to try something new. That “new” was a program. I still work a program. No MAT. 

*This post is about a medication I despise and took as prescribed!!*

I had a “doctor that specializes in addiction” prescribe me Seroquel for insomnia back in January this year.

At the time, I was stressed. Stressed about a lot of things. Still to this day, it’s hard for me to whine about something (my stressors) when I have so much to be grateful for. I was losing sleep (and shared if it was necessary).

So this doctor prescribed 100mg Quetiapine (Seroquel) once nightly for sleep. It definitely knocked me out at night, so I took it as prescribed. This doctor did not explain a SINGLE thing about this medication. He didn’t explain possible side effects, what the med is actually truly used for, nothing. Just basically: “here, take this.”

At the time, i didn’t do any research. I just decided to “listen to the doctor”....because I spent many years being my own doctor (I’m a recovering opiate addict).

I continued to take this medication nightly for 6 months. My script never had refills, so I would book the $275 appointment with him at the end of the month. After a 30-second virtual session with the doctor, my Seroquel prescription was refilled. The doctor never once recommended that I consider switching meds, tapering meds, or duhhhhh how about recover and get off all meds. He just kept refilling and refilling.

Obviously, months later I gained a shit load of weight (very unlike me as I’ve been thin my whole life). It blew my mind that a medication could drastically alter my metabolism SO much. There really wasn’t much change in my eating habits. This was a huge red flag to me. Also, although it was very subtle over time, I noticed my personality changed. It was very subtle though. I would catch myself having some seriously dark, intrusive thoughts. They would also loop around and around..... and the only word I could really use to describe the sensation was ... a feeling of hopelessness. A hopelessness about what, I wasn’t sure. But just a general sense of “life is dumb. There’s only suffering. Whats the point. Blah blah.” Just strange shit.

Seroquel was the only medication I was on....so after 7 months, I just stopped taking it. Cold turkey.

I had extreme nausea for a solid two weeks. I vomited every single day. It was mind blowing just how harsh a human body would react to the withdrawal of a particular chemical. I had been through opiate withdrawal, but Seroquel was on another level for me regarding GI stuff.

Luckily (thank God our bodies are so resilient and they weren’t “designed” to need any pharma chemicals to function).... the withdrawal effects went away after a couple weeks. Started losing weight....and the “darkness” just disappeared.

I became absolutely irate with the doctor.

I started doing research online (medical journals, authentic scientific literature, studies, etc.)

After reading about how Seroquel truly affects the body (it changes the lipid-profile within the bloodstream among a thousand other things).  WHY on EARTH would a doctor just so haphazardly prescribe something so incredibly hard-core???

I had the realization that this doctor was essentially a legal drug dealer. He never gave me much attention because I opted out of the suboxone program.... a cash cow for him.

My mind is still blown that he prescribed that med without hesitation or educating me. I felt kinda violated.

I’m just grateful I didn’t suffer any long term side effects/irreparable brain damage/and that I wasn’t on it very long.

Am I gonna go back and sue him? For what? Mental anguish? Lol.... no. But I feel more of a calling to warn people about the dangers of that particular drug. Hell, probably all those anti-psychotics are garbage.....if you’re taking them off-label by the doc.

It’s just a shitty experience. A shitty lesson in life. A lot of doctors just don’t really give a shit about their patients. 

TL:dr 

I took Seroquel for 7 months straight. Cold turkeyed it, suffered for a few weeks from withdrawal. Seroquel is a very dangerous medication. My doctor prescribed it like it wasnt no thangggg. What a crook!",7

Now I know in the opiate community, kratom is seen as benign, but it isn't. It has worse withdrawals than oxy to me. 

I've tried to get clean so many times, maybe 50+ times in the last 3 years, trying to find shortcuts with meds, etc, which I think I have. But it never stuck. I always go back, at higher dosages, this time, over 100grams per day, which is insane. 

I am on day 4 now, using other meds to counteract the opioid withdrawals. I'm reading other posts saying it takes 6months-1year, the most I've ever made it was 1.5 months, and I was on adderall to help. 

All of this has to stop. I can never get any real sober time behind me, always one thing or another to escape this mind I have. Months to years of PAWS from continued drug use for so many years...

Im just so depressed that I don't think I can actually do this, all of these horrendous withdrawals, staying up days and nights on adderall to get through acutes, have damaged my body. 

I also got Cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome last quit, which makes it permanent that I can never use marijuana ever again. Can't use it for this quit either. 

Im just so lost. The months of depression, anxiety, insomnia are so horrendous. I don't know if I can do it. 

Please give some advice as to what you did after failing so many times to finally make it stick. I know I can't do this myself anymore. It isn't possible. In my mid 30's, in horrible health, staying at my mom's house during acutes and beyond. I gave her my wallet, and told her under no circumstance, give it to me within 6 months. 

But I do have my adderall, gabapentin for acutes, clonidine, etc, which all needs to go as well. I have to go full on sober after this acute period passes, which should be within the next 2-4 days. 

If it isn't kratom, it is adderall (not binging, but not good either). Im just so sick of the agony I put myself through every month trying to quit. 

I plan on joining an NA/AA group, getting a sponsor, and a therapist. I know there has to be some spiritual growth involved. This has ruined my life for the last 6 years, Im almost fucking 40 years old. 

Please, any advice you can give, what worked for you, will be much appreciated.",51

I have also been formally diagnosed with ADHD, CPTSD and ASD level one (sometimes caller Asperger's)

I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD after being held in a mental hospital against my will for 16 days about a year ago after my family called the police on me after I had an autisic meltdown at their place. The hospital refused to believe I was autistic and would not let me contact my psychiatrist. They fucked up all my medications and generally treated me terribly. 

I have had a lot of trauma in my life. Three years ago my twin brother died of an opiate overdose. I have never really gotten a chance to grieve that loss. As traumatic as that was, my experience in the hospital was even worse. I have nightmares constantly and often dissociate and get flashbacks. 

I have a really good job and I keep my addiction pretty well hidden. But its getting harder and harder to do that. 

I want to get help, but I was so traumatized by my last experience in a hospital that I refuse to go anywhere where I would be ""trapped"" or not be able to come and go as I wish. I don't want to go to detox because I don't want to be locked away.

I relapsed. but I don't really think it it like that - I knew I was going to do it as soon as I was able to at some point over the week. what I didn't expect though is how empty it felt.

if I didn't use today, it would have been 5 days clean. the longest I've gone in months is like 16 hours. the beginnings were hell, and I begged strangers to partners to fake friends to help me get some. I just didn't think I could do it. I've gotten off a buffet of different drugs before, but for some reason this run felt different. I genuinely thought it would kill me eventually, and I was okay with that.

instead, day after day, attempted after attempt failed. until finally today, my girl and I each got a bun, we used, laughed, relaxed. it was...okay.

but what is weird, is it was just as natural and bohemian and lovely when it was just us smoking weed on the way to get it. no sickness. no anger and attitudes and resentments and disappointment. just us talking about the last few days apart, new bands and shows we've seen, and in general our insight on recovery.

I'm now all out of dope. it was a fun adventure, but honestly... I don't think I want to do it again. I think, for the near future, I'm free from the craving for a bit. it simply isn't worth it unless it's also alleviating an intense sickness. idk.

The drive to be better than the man I was yesterday is there still, and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I look around at the guys in my sponsorship family and i spot mostly differences, the common thread of course being that which binds us all together: our common problem and its common solution. Otherwise, i don't desire to hang out with them or anything of the sort. I've sponsored my fair share of guys, not as many as some but i've dedicated a lot if my time to the work. I can't help but feel that I have a different path to help this world in my career field. When dedicating so much time to a program, i inherently lose valuable time towards my studies. I don't know if it's authentic to doubt myself in such a way, nor do I know if more-or-less forcing myself to continue working a vigorous 12th step is authentic. I know a lot of people go through similar things at about this amount of time, so if anyone has any experience to share, please do. Thanks all, best wishes to everyone.",8

No AA, no doctors or support. It's beginning to take its toll on me. I feel very very depressed and guilty about things that happened years ago. I have noone to talk to who gets what it's like to realise how your shitty childhood made you a shitty alcoholic adult. I don't know any recovering alcoholics online or in real life to talk about this kind of stuff with and I just feel totally alienated. I have no coping mechanisms and am beginning to have some really seriously dark thoughts. 

I'm so anxious about going to AA in this small town. I'm scared I won't be able to find the meeting. I'm scared I'll get there and people will think I'm just being overdramatic because I'm young. (24) 

I just have zero hope, and am beginning to feel I don't deserve recovery or happiness as I've been such a pos in the past. I really don't want to drink again though. At least I can control of I kill myself but I can't control of drink will kill me or not if I start again.",28

DOC was heroin, but started off with whatever I could find, I did not ever discriminate. 
I feel at a certain point I basically abandoned my family, for about 4 years or so, until my parents paid for me to go to rehab, and I've been clean since then aside from a brief relapse after leaving. 
Honestly, I feel guilty. My brother(now 17) and sister(now 13) grew and changed so much, and for a while I felt like I didn't even know them. Thankfully we have built up somewhat of a relationship again. At least enough that it feels normal that I'm back around, even though I don't live with them anymore. 
Thing is, and basically my question, is that I really want to tell them I'm sorry for leaving them. I want them to know that it matters to me that I could have hurt them, or that they were just young and didn't understand. As far as I know, my family hasn't told them about my addiction, and I feel like I want to be honest with them about why I was gone, because I want to be a source of support to them as they are growing older and probably are already experiencing this ugly part of life through people they go to school with or whatever.
I'm afraid. I am terrified that they will look at me differently, and not feel the same. I don't want them to look down on me, but I don't want to hide myself from them either. 
As a bonus, I'm also completely terrified about my little sister getting involved with the wrong people. She reminds me of myself, in self destructive ways (self harm, isolating, self conscious, anxious, etc) and I want her to come to me to feel safe, and I have told her I will never try to be in charge of her, I will only ever keep her safe because I know I can't stop her once she decides to start experimenting or whatever comes up for her. I am not her parent, and I am so afraid to risk making her want to hide herself from me, because I hid myself from my family, and I want her to know she can call me to come get her at 3 am, if she sneaks out to go to a party or whatever, and she will not question it because she knows I wouldn't be mad. I am trying to hard to make this true for her. But I don't know how to protect that feeling of safety for her towards me. I desperately want to protect her, and I worry if something happens she won't come to me. 

I'm sorry this post is such a mess, I'm very stressed out, and a lot of it starts with me wanting them to know my guard is down and they know my shame and they can feel safe feeling vulnerable with me, if they don't have anyone else. 
Does anyone have sibling experience? I just need some opinions. I'm so afraid to mess this up. I can only do it once, and I can't fix it if I fuck up. I just don't want them to hate me.",4

Thankfully, I have one week clean as of today. But anyway, about a week and a half ago, I overdosed on fentanyl and ended up in the hospital for 6 days after 6 months clean. I’ve overdosed in the past, but I’ve always been narcaned, brought to the ER for an hour or so, and released. This time was much worse though; I ended up with severe pneumonia, and a few blood clots in my lungs, and was on a ventilator for two days and IV antibiotics/blood thinners for all six days. I’ve made a full recovery thankfully, and have gotten back on the proverbial wagon. 

The only issue is that ever since that OD, I’ve had near migraine-level headaches on a daily basis. Every single day. It’s not so severe in the sense that I can’t function, but it is also definitely not just normal headaches. I’ve tried looking through google for ideas as to why this is happening, but haven’t really found anything useful. And I know, I should see a doctor. I don’t have insurance at the moment, but found a plan I may be able to afford, and once I get that figured out, I will go.

I have been completely sober for almost 3 weeks now. Overall I like it. It saves me money, I'm never hungover or tired from weed or alcohol, and I'm more productive and clear-headed. I was drinking too much. At times it is a drag like at events like a camping trip and my friend's  bachelor party and wedding are coming up. But I have learned that I don't have to drink to have fun, relax, or cope with the stressors of life, and that I have a strong enough will to say no for good reasons.

I was told today by a mutual friend (S) who told me because he was concerned that he hadn't mentioned it to anyone else. X, S and I were all roomies at rehab and very close. I'm still very close to S and both are like family. 

It was X's sobriety birthday the other day and I messaged him 'Happy 12 years sober Birthday' and he said thanks and didn't mention the drinking or drug use.

TBH this has thrown me. X said he doesn't think of the drinking as anything other than a send off to his dad and was ""spiritual"" in his words. No doubt he thinks the same of the ayahuasca.
We are planning to speak to him next week in a facetime. But I thought I'd get the gauge about what this means and if people count this as a relapse or what.

I’ve been an addict/ alcoholic since I was about 20, and it took many years to finally start finding some freedom from primarily alcohol, but other substances as well. I was able to stop drinking over the past year and some change, in huge part due to recovery programs, and utilizing nicotine and Kratom to help me stay balanced. I realized those weren’t permanent solutions though, and after about 8 or so months of using them both regularly I dropped them cold turkey two weeks ago. 

I hadn’t realized how much of an instability this would cause in my life at that moment, and i ended up buying my own bullshit and try speed and Benzos to help facilitate bouncing back to normal. Absolutely crazy mindset? Yes I completely know, but here we are. 

That was approx 6 days ago, and it went really fast and awful, so I have been completely clean for at least 36 hours, but I’m really grappling with the profound depression and sense of emptiness that’s been following me.

Anyway, I've been seeing a psychiatrist for several months, and when I started seeing her, I was very upfront about my struggles with substances. I let her know that I was terrified of meds, that I wanted to stay on the mild end of medication with low doses and non-addictive medication. So we started experimenting with non-addictive anti-anxiety meds and mood stabilizers to figure out what's going on. 

The meds aren't working and just make my symptoms worse. I tell her that and she decides she wants to evaluate me for ADHD. Turns out I meet all of the criteria. She says she wants to prescribe me Adderall. We talked about it for an hour with her reassuring me that she would prescribe a very low dose, we would be very cautious and check in regularly, and that she actually thinks my history with substance abuse was an attempt to self-medicate the ADHD.  

After talking it through, I think she's probably right. But I still feel... guilty? I know I didn't go into this appointment seeking drugs. I know I am not going into this wanting to get high in any way. It's not even that I feel like I will abuse this, it's just that I feel like its cheating. I feel like it means I'm losing at sobriety.

I work with in a social services role  - and do some volunteer work on the side.  I know several people who suffer with truly horrendous addictions.  

I try to help where I can.  But I just do not know sometimes.   I question if I am really helping, or just enabling.  I do not buy drugs - but things like helping with food, or a month or two of cell service.  Never more than $10-$15 a week.  I guess a part of me knows that there is money going to drugs that could buy these things for themselves, and that maybe by me buying these things for them - I am just delaying their recovery.  

Just do not know.  I try to encourage them to get into a treatment program - and they say they want to go - but they have not.  

The consequences are already pretty bad.  Homelessness, infections from needles, liver problems from alcohol - and probably a hundred other things I do not realize.  It is not an overstatement to say they have nearly died several times.  One man goes into the hospital at least 3 times a week - stabilizes, and then rips out the IVs and comes out to drink again.  

What do you wish someone had done for you when you were at the peak of your addiction?  Right now, I am just giving a little, and trying to talk through the traumas that they say led them to where they are now.  

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this.",9

I was reading a post in another alcohol-related sub and it reminded me of a woman who I met in outpatient rehab in 2018.  I can't remember her name, but I do remember the first time I saw her.  She skin color matched the color of the waiting room walls: yellow.  I had never seen jaundice on that level before.  It was scary, and I immediately knew that she would die if she continued to drink.  Not on the level that you would say to someone who engages in reckless behavior, but her organs would cease to function level.  She was on the waiting list for a liver transplant.  Over the course of the next few weeks, her skin tone got better, so I just hope she is still on the mend.

Same goes to all of you.  Our health matters.",20

\--------------------------

Last night I realized I hadn't posted and I almost panicked.  The topic of ""Mental Health"" really describes my week. Overall, I am in a much better than I was in active addiction. Most importantly, I am regularly taking my prescribed meds. I'm doing things that I never would have considered to do or thought I was ""too busy"" to do. I take my dog to the dog park, I cook regularly, I'm learning to cross stitch, and I make plans to do things. I had a moment this week where I thought about how I would plan my next day based on the feelings I was currently in. For example, if I had plans to meet a friend or go to an appointment, if I was depressed a day or two before, I would make this irrational decisions that I won't feel up to it so I simply didn't go or I would make up an excuse. When the day of the event came, I found myself in a much better mood than I was before, but depressed because I already cancelled and it would look silly to show up. It creates this vicious cycle; cancelling because you're depressed and being depressed because you cancelled. Never ending and maddening.  


I'm still getting used to thinking clearly and without much bias. This is so new to me. When I feel my emotions, I actually feel them. The most minute inconveniences doesn't throw my emotions off balance. My favorite part is that I think of others feelings. I watch my words and my thought patterns. Even if it's true, I think if actually needs to be said and that used to be so hard for me. Before, I had to make sure that others felt how I felt. If I feel like their apology didn't balance how much hurt they caused (mind you, I'm in active addiction and not taking my meds, so this ""hurt"" is horribly skewed obviously), I would harp on them and just be relentless that they hurt me and they HAVE to make it up. How fucking miserable and embarrassing. Learning that I can only control myself and my boundaries was a hard concept, but exceptionally rewarding once I finally began to put it into practice. I no longer feel that need to feel ""redeemed"" or exact revenge. I say my piece, I remind them of the boundaries, and I let go immediately. I know now that holding on to that pain does absolutely nothing for them like I thought it did and only hurts me and my mental health.   


Am I doing everything that I want and when I want? No, but I'm aware of it and trying my best everyday to reincorporate things that I've enjoyed. Finding a routine has been the tough part, but it has only been less than a month I've been home and this recovery process is literally one day at a time. What I'm happy for right now is my mental health. No one can take that from me except me and I'm treasuring it like the Mona Lisa. This is the best part of sobriety.",10

I did Iv meth from 17-23, and IV heroin from 20-32. I’m 80 days clean today and it NEVER GETS BETTER. I still wake up moaning and groaning with those bone breaking aches and restless legs. I don’t sleep for shit. I woke up to throw up last night.... I still have gastro issues, i am soaked with sweat all the time, my skin burns, I have chills. I sneeze all day. I have no motivation, I’m weak, I have no drive. 

The physical withdrawal never ends. While on heroin I bought a house, got a degree in honors, worked, saved a lot of money, went on family vacations multiple times a year, got my boobs done (cash), saved $8k to put myself in a detox, have 2 nice cars, and nice stuff.

Thanks to sobriety I’m filing bankruptcy and frankly I don’t care. If I have to be this miserable physically and mentally the rest of my life, I don’t want anything. I will sleep on the streets. I just don’t care anymore. 

Is it normal to hit a rock bottom in sobriety? Is it normal to feel like nothing matters anymore when the drugs made you motivated and successful. I got clean because of society’s push, my fiancé, and I had no veins left. But who cares... it’s better than this. 

And yes I have seen multiple doctors. Last time
I went to detox in 2016 I made it 94 days of pure torture before I gave up and relapsed after losing my house, and everything and living on someone’s couch. I finally relapsed and worked my ass off to have what I have now......",8

Like the title says, I’m looking for meetings that are non-AA or NA.
I’m currently in a sober living home and the house manager is requiring I do a meeting every day before I find an IOP program.
I’ve done about 3 NA meetings, and while I really enjoyed the first one, the last to.... well not so much.
I’ve been to SMART meetings, I think I’m gonna try those. 
Does anyone know of any other groups like that I could join?
Also, disclaimer, I have nothing against NA, I just wanna explore alternative recovery groups.
Also, I’m living I’m San Francisco. I’d actually prefer in person meetings, if there’s any out there.
Thanks yo

Rehab was great and I left feeling confident. Perhaps I was feeling too confident, so my higher power decided to check that. 

About an hour into our journey home we got in a significant car accident. We are both fine but my car is pretty damaged. I'm choosing to see this as my first test. As they say, once you leave that comfortable safe environment it gets really difficult and now I truly understand that. 

After the accident I dealt with stronger cravings than I had felt in the 35 days I spent in rehab. I'm going to my first meeting tonight and plan to pick up my 30 day chip. I'm proud and grateful I didn't give into those strong cravings and am grateful to understand what lays ahead of me.",88

I’m coming up on 9 years sober, have a solid foundation in my sobriety, and in general am not concerned about relapse. I have a ton of anxiety about dental work and always have a pretty extreme trauma response to dental procedures. They will do local anesthesia but in the past I’ve had experiences where it isn’t enough so they are offering me Ativan. I have never taken it before so I don’t know my reaction (benzos were not my DOC). I’m not concerned about whether taking it once for this reason is considered a relapse, but rather I am worried about whether it could trigger something in me that puts me at risk for relapse going forward. In other words am I going to like the feeling and start thinking ooh I should get more of that. It’s a nuanced thing and ultimately I have to choose for myself what feels right but I guess I’m curious if anyone else has been in this situation and how they went about it. Thanks",3

I'll try to stay concise but no that I have zero knowledge about how recovery works, but I'm hoping to get some guidance on what, if anything, I can do to help a relative. This is in Illinois if it matters.

He's been an alcoholic for years, lost multiple jobs, lost his house, wife, kids, got multiple DUIs, overnight stints in jail, etc. etc. A slow and drawn out spiral that has silently wreaked havoc on my family. I say silently but it's something the family clearly prefers to not talk about.

I'm coming from an admittedly ignorant place. Being his niece, I don't know the specifics of what his siblings have done over the years to help. I know his father has spent almost $200k bailing him out, paying for his house (and rent once he lost the house), day-to-day money, etc. I don't know if he's ever been in a halfway house, rehab, or any kind of recovery center.

Now he's officially homeless with practically $0 to his name, and his siblings have collectively decided they're not helping him. Again, I try to not judge that decision as I don't know the specifics of the relationship there. On the flip side, I also don't know how they all view addiction in general or how they've even approached ""trying to help"" over the years.

Right, I said I'd stay concise.

So he's homeless, broke, and presumably has no insurance. I'm not in contact with him but I'm struggling with whether or not I should put myself in the situation and try to help — if there's even anything I can do. And that's if he even accepts help. I do know that he's been going door to door to family members homes asking for a place to stay, which is a new rock bottom even for him.

What are his options given the situation? Are there free recovery centers for uninsured folks? Is it possible to check him in somewhere that he can't check himself out of, or is that only if he's committed a crime and is given court-ordered treatment? I'm sure COVID complicates this even more as I assume places are running at a lower capacity, but curious if anyone here has information.

Thanks so much.",3
