My girlfriend is too. I never thought that I could do this but I did. There were numerous times that I thought I would slip but I didn’t and I am very proud of myself. I remember setting my I day counting app back to day one multiple times every time I slipped. Then this is the last time that I had to set it back. 

This is the longest I have ever been clean. It is a proud moment knowing that I am 8 months and 12 days sober from everything I have abused.

You know you need to stop when your girlfriend gets raped by your drug dealer’s friend then you and her go on a week binge. 

I was not giving a fuck, driving while fucked up on a gram of coke in the snow, to get more. 

There was a point in my life where I was going so hard I thought I would end up dead or in prison. Luckily neither of those things happened and I am the happiest I have ever been. There are multiple things that could have happened in the process of getting to this point that should have made me fall down into a hole again but not doing that has proved to me and the people around me that I am stronger than I was before.

I did this for not only myself but for everything around me, work, family, friends, my girlfriend. I never wanted to hurt anyone but I did in the years of my addictions. 

I have never been as happy as I am now but it is proving to me that I am able to accomplish so much more than I thought I could.

My girlfriend and I are both clean for 255 days and it is the best thing that has ever happened to us.",165,0

And to the ones who are just starting your journey to getting better, stay strong & keep it up!  No matter how far along you are, you always gotta start somewhere & starting is the hardest part.  I love seeing this positivity on Reddit.  Also, something I left out of my post, the one who helped me through things the most is the one who’ll never be able to understand what he’s done for me or how much he’s helped.  He was by my side 24/7 & still is.  [I love you Buddy, ur da best boi](https://imgur.com/gallery/s6vPyQi) 


I have to tell someone because none of my friends knew quite how bad my use was & this is a major accomplishment to myself.  I never went more than 30hrs without rolling a bowl & never thought I’d make it more than 30 days.  For anyone struggling with wanting to quit meth & can’t I wanna share my experience of getting clean & not giving in to cravings.


Week 1 - About what you would expect; ate a lot of sweets & salty snacks & for some reason I craved oatmeal & cereal constantly.  If I wasn’t eating I was sleeping.  During this period I slept about 14 hours a day.  This was the “easiest” part of the process to me, but still wasn’t easy.  I only say that because I didn’t have cravings during this period.

Week 2 - Absolute HELL.  Headaches, stiffness in my neck, fever, depression, insomnia, feeling weak both physically & mentally, bad cravings at least 3 times a day, waking up with anxiety attacks & cold sweats.  I just cried, not because I hurt, but because I felt so useless & like such a weak human being.  Like I had accepted that this drug controlled me & I couldn’t make it without it.  If I was gonna cave, it would’ve been during this period.  I almost did when I got a message from an old dealer asking if I was looking.  What stopped is the thought of all the hell I just went through & how it would’ve been for nothing had I caved.  No way was I going through that again.  

Week 3 - This period was more of a mild version of week 2.  The only thing that intensified were my cravings but I had already accepted that I wouldn’t give in.  I felt stronger, more in control, more alive, etc.  I had a few episodes of anxiety attacks in the middle of the night but they weren’t as bad.  Other than those hiccups this is really when I began to feel like my old self again.  I was reconnecting with friends I had been putting on the back burner & began to socialize more & didn’t mind seeing people I knew at the store.  Little things like that.

Week 4 - A few weak cravings here & there but personally I expect that for the rest of my life tbh; I do believe once an addict, always an addict so I’ve accepted this much.  This is when I really felt my chemical balance start to come back & started hanging out with friends more & even initiating the idea of doing things with friends.  I began to “exercise” (for me it’s just playing pick up basketball) more which I haven’t done in at least 2 years.  I had more stamina, was interesting in dating again, managed to bag an amazing gf who I had been friends with for a few years & had some romantic involvement with before.  She helped a lot & she knew my situation & was more than willing to help.  She’s been great for me as of now & I began to feel real happiness again instead of what I call “artificial happiness”.  I really felt my chemical balance start to level itself back out here & have felt great ever since.  



So anyone trying & struggling to quit, don’t take this as what to 100% expect, this is just my personal journey.  What I went through during week 2-3 can last for months.  That doesn’t mean you should give up on getting your real happiness back.  You cannot quit if you truly do not want to & if you’re not ready, that is okay.  It took me a long time of just bullshitting with my own thoughts until one day I decided I was done for real.  I still have a LOOOONNNNGGGG way to go, probably the rest of my life, but I’m okay with that.  I’m not ashamed of who I was for those <4 years & I see it now as an example of what I don’t wanna be ever again.  I didn’t realize how much my personality changed until sometime during week 3.  It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done & it’s even harder if you don’t have anybody to talk to about it.  That’s why I’m here, I had to tell someone because I don’t have friends who use or have used & quit.  Which is a good thing because they have been nothing but supportive, but they didn’t think I was as bad off as I was.  Hell I didn’t think I was as bad off as I was.  I kept myself clean, maintained a decent weight, & kept my job the whole time.  I felt like I had no reason to quit.  Now that I’ve been clearheaded I feel like I’ve entered a whole new realm & I don’t wanna go back.  I WON’T go back.  


Anyways, thanks for listening to my rambling.. I just had to get this off my chest & wanted to give a timeline to maybe help someone trying to stop using to know what to expect.",288,0

I mean, I felt down most of the time, but I didn't realize my thoughts could be different because I knew no different. Having nothing to compare my thoughts to, I tried to live with them because then I didn't know what to do to change them. The only relief I knew was to get drunk or stuff myself. I could not think clearly enough to find the help I needed. I stumbled, confused through my days.

But, bogged down with the hatred my family taught me, ***everything*** was a struggle. Does that make sense? My thoughts were with me everywhere I went and with everything I did. How could I escape them?

So, not having coping skills, I got through my day as best I could, but I could not wait until it was time for me to go home because that meant I could buy beer on the way plus fattening drive through food so I could get home and self-sedate myself away from my struggles.

That also meant my problems did not get resolved, plus I gained weight. None of that helped me. But it is the pattern I glued myself to for the next several years until I got to where I HAD to find actual long lasting relief because I was at the edge of a cliff I thought I would throw myself off of.

After years of trying to get sober only to relapse shortly after again and again, periods of psychotherapy, some AA meetings here and there and one brief out-patient rehab, on November 15, 2007, I called my local AA number I found online and asked for help because I did not know what to do. The next day, November 16, 2007, I began my life in sobriety. I still had kazillions of problems, and maintained my over-eating habits, but I stopped drinking alcohol. I also got back into psychotherapy soon after.

I did not know what lay ahead, but slowly, I got through it, with the help I needed to guide me through the darkest parts.

I give thanks for being on disability, because it allowed me all the time I needed to focus on my recovery and heal slowly so I could get actual strength. If you walk on a broken leg too soon, you aren’t helping yourself, are you? I learned the same goes with healing emotional wounds. Learn to respect your feelings and give them the space and time they need for them to heal their strongest. And you do that by validating them for what and how they truly are.

Once they gain that validation, they settle down, heal, and give you their best when called on. The negative chains break and disappear because they never belonged to you in the first place! That is why they have to go! If they were a genuine part of who you are, they would chill out and settle down. They wouldn’t be nagging you to pay attention to them.

For this reason, what could be more eco-friendly and environmentally safer for our souls than that?",33,0

Everyone else is dead, then I get clean.  I learned quickly that the company I keep tend not to die of old age. 
So In the last few weeks the first guy over does or suicide it’s really unclear. This was a person that we hung out we had hours long conversations for years. He would get clean for a year then go back to it. He had done this a few times over the last few years. Covid hit and he fell off the grid again this time he was in able to make it back. 
The second guy was murdered last week. He was a kid when I met him. He annoyed the shit out of me at first. Then I sat down and talked to him and man I realized he was just a little nuts. He reminded me of myself when I first put the shit down. After a year or so he moved away we kept in touch for a while then we didn’t. 
The sad part is I’m getting almost numb to the deaths. I mean around here there have been more than a few others I’ve known die of the things addicts die from. I’m not sure why I’m even typing this out. I’m not sure the point I’m trying to make. I just don’t know.",17,1

My purpose with this post is not to sell anyone anything; it is to encourage you to think about taking up a hobby by seeing some of the benefits it can provide you.

For me, it's a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or food on earth

that makes me feel the way my crafting does. It really boosts my self-esteem. 

Plus, it is a WONDERFUL distraction!

Ok, so I did some very simple sewing as a little girl.

I made strapless dresses and matching hand bags for my Barbie and I remember making a blue and white polka dot summery poncho to go with my outdated hand me down red and white striped swimsuit that had a solid white pleated skirt and a zipper up the back.

I think I was a teenager then.

I began making jewelry early in 2000 something when a co-worker showed me some lovely jewelry she made for her niece's confirmation.

I was like WHAT??? Where did you get the beads and how did you learn??

On my time off I went to a local bead store and went to town!!

When I first started making jewelry, it made my spirit soar!

People I worked with wanted me to make them personalized jewelry!

They even paid me to do it!

That was such an honor for me because they paid money for my work, and they wore MY PIECES!!!

And when I give someone something I have made by hand? Oh, My Gosh, that really feels GREAT!

I think I started to pay attention to my writing about 10 years ago and have worked hard to better it because I see it as a craft also. Art is when you take separate pieces and shape them into something new. I do that every time I write something original. 

Like I said in my opening, it's a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or food on earth that makes me feel the way my crafting does.

Making beaded jewelry using simple gemstones which astound me on their own, lifts my spirits.

PLUS, I control the colors and have made outfits based on different stones.

For example, I have a pair of  denim skinnies I love and wear a lot. They are off white, blue and black floral. I have some beads at home that go with those colors nicely and am making a necklace, bracelet, and earrings set to go with them.

That is one example of the fun crafting can add to your life! And when I wear my jewelry out, I always get complimented on them. 

Other pieces I have made over the years are Christmas ornaments and pendents using cookie cutters,  polymer clay, texture sheets, and acrylic paints.

I made a star using another cookie cutter, gold paint, a texture sheet to make the stars on the surface of my polymer clay star,and a beaded star loop for it to hang from. 

You can get the polymer clay and cookie cutters from Walmart, either in person in the store or you can order them online. I bought the texture sheets from on online jewelry website. And there are oodles of art stores and craft supplies online!

How I benefit from crafting is the pleasure it gives me when I see what I have made and am actually using it. I crochet kitchen hot pads in any colors I want! And I can make items for my bathroom, coasters, curtain pulls, armchair holder dealies for my remotes, and anything else I can think of. 

Clothing!! From baby items to shawls, sweaters, hats, afghans, costumes, and wedding dresses!!

There's knitting also, and lets not forget sewing and painting or digital artwork! Drawing! Calligraphy!

My point is there are kabillions of different hobbies and tons of how-to videos on YouTube!

So what would you like to make?

Or, if you already craft, how does it make you feel when you hold in your hand what you have made by hand and what about when people compliment you on your work?

Again, for me, it makes my spirits soar, puts a big smile on my face and makes my day!! And when I give someone something I have made by hand and they appreciate it? 

WOW!

I know I am repeating myself, but I cannot say this enough:

***It is a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or***

***food or anything self-medicating on this earth that makes me feel the way my crafting does.***

So, what do you think? Will you give crafting a try?",37,0

I am 15 and i have never really been drunk, but i have however used tons of drugs, been interested in methods to get high and taken many Prescription drugs. I started with molly and after heavy use for a month i stopped, then weed couple of times, then xanax, lately (september) i took nootropics such as ""noofen"" and benzos and sleeping pills that are prescription such as zolpidem, bromazepam and diazepam, mostly zolpidem and especially the most i took noofen. I have taken it tons of times and didnt care about side effects till now. 

Last time i took anything, it was zolpidem (15mg) 3 days ago. Right now i dont have any will to use any drugs, including it. 
Why? Mostly because, ive noticed recently, ive gotten slow, really slow, in a mental way, my memory has gone to shit, my judging and problem solving skills are awful, i feel like degrading, i hate this feeling, i cannot debate with my friends over interests as well as ive used to before and some of smart people my age that i highly respect laugh about me because ive gotten illogical and slower. 
Please. Dont tell me that i am an idiot and that its my fault. Im not denying it, i am just simply sick of hearing it. I want help, i just want some support. 
How do i recover and train my brain skills to be the same as they were before, before i was pretty smart and bright teenager, now i am degrading junkie (not for long) 
I have positivity and a huge will to change for the better, just, how do i improve my thinking skills, my problem solving and judgemental skills? How do i do it as a 15year old teenager?

Those scars badgered me with crippling poisonous thoughts holding me back, defeating me daily. Finally, after thirty years of trying to get sober, relapsing, trying to get sober again, relapsing,  therapy, and AA meetings, I finally found out HOW to get those damn scars to shut the hell up and leave me alone.

I did this: I accepted “HOW” they made me feel.

Again: I accepted “HOW” they made me feel.

Let’s think about that: My feelings tormented me growing up beaten up by horrible people who bullied and abused me. Put downs, dreadful  punishments, discounted, told no one would love me, I would do nothing  well, I would never have my family’s approval no matter what I did, I  never measured up. Even following their instructions to the tiniest detail made no difference. They ALWAYS found fault with me.

So, how did that make me feel?

Shattered. Fragmented. Torpedoed. Defective. Useless. Unloved. Defective.

Those problems showed up daily; routinely, I sabotaged myself. It was  the most exhausting battle. I wanted to get ahead, but I undermined  everything I tried. I changed jobs after about a year, running scared they would find me out. I worried the bosses would find out what a fraud I was and fire me after a big scene.

It is no wonder I drank; I didn’t know what else to do because congestion saturated my brain with that negative toxic waste reigning supreme.

Can you relate to my writing? What thoughts bother you? How do you talk to yourself? Do you know where your negative, defeating thoughts  come from?

Mine came from the people who raised me. Who pounded the negative trash that bounces around in your brain, crippling you?

So, now, how do we get rid of it? Some people can reason it out of their thinking. I read up on how therapy works and how to do this or that. The advice helped others; I knew that. But it didn’t help me. I had to go to the source and consciously ***ACCEPT HOW*** their behavior made me feel.

Learning about subjects I knew nothing about, I found out that my emotions were doing their job. They let me know something needed my attention. Those hurt feelings are all mine. I could attend to them as easily as I would take care of a broken nail or a cut or any physical wound.

My emotional wounds, jumping around in my head, needed my validation.  They were mine; they belonged to me and only I could put those stuffed, hurting, aching bruises at rest to heal the gaping wounds in my soul.

Once I acknowledged them, including crying, grieving for what I lost, they settled down. And another astounding thing happened. My thinking became logical.

I felt stronger, happier, more confident. So, I kept going. I watched movies that made me cry because I knew the painful topics would trigger something tormented inside me I needed to face.

That is important to understand because where we see people acting out, or hiding behind their computer screen trolling and bullying others, that is what we are seeing.

Something unresolved gets triggered and boom, out it comes! Every time we speak, we show part of our inner landscape. That inner landscape  builds as we grow up, beginning in our infancy. Until we sit down and purposefully recognize our triggers and disarm them, we will always be at their mercy.

Would you like to know the best part of all this? When you go through this process yourself, you see firsthand how it works. You learn cause and effect and the best part is you can help others with your experiences and the progress you have made in your life.",74,0

So even though I'm surrounded by people (my roommates), I feel super alone. I've definitely alienated people the past few months and that obviously isn't fun. Regardless, I just want to be able to get back to my social self, but I grind everyday hoping that happens sometime soon. I worry that I'm losing strength to continue being sober, but I know at this point relapse will just prolong my misery. I'm staying as busy as I can: working, exercising, eating, but I don't get much relief from those things. I know there's always more I can do but it's hard to do anything at all when all I want to do is sit around all day. I suppose it is what it is.",4,0

I just miss the taste and social aspect of it but not the intoxicating aspects of it.

I didn’t get shitfaced, but the right after I took that first drink I just thought “why am I doing this? you were doing so well”. I thought that if I drank more I might loosen up and it’ll make me more comfortable. Wrong. Now all I have is a headache and a heavy conscience. I feel like I’ve let down my friends, my family, and most of all myself. I’m scared to tell my counselor tomorrow. I don’t want her to be disappointed in me.

I was a chubby teen due to my lengthy lithium prescription, that developed into an eating disorder, so I googled symptoms of ADHD one day and lied to my doc to get a script.

Not only did it help me lose weight, it gave me the confidence I’ve always dreamed of. Anxiety and depression disappeared and I felt superhuman and so happy. But it’s just artificial happiness.

As my tolerance grew, my doc prescribed adderall on top of the vyvanse. 20mg twice a day. I popped it like candy and went on benders until one day I nearly checked myself into a psych ward because of paranoia and auditory hallucinations.

My current doc prescribes me 60mg Vyvanse, but I double it without his knowledge. He doesn’t know about my prior substance issues either obviously. But for the past 2 years it’s been a constant cycle of doubling my dose, telling myself I won’t blow through my script in 2 weeks, suffering for a week or 2 at the end of every month, repeat.

When I’m not on vyvanse or adderall, I can’t function. I get intense cravings and become extremely irritable. I feel extremely lethargic and will push aside shit that needs to be done, not giving a fuck about the consequences. It’s like Im half a person. I’m 25, no job because of my anxiety/depression, and i get “high” off vyvanse almost every day and sit in my room and play video games or stare at my phone. 

I’ve always been honest with my therapists but this is something I feel I can’t come clean about to anyone. My therapist knows about my struggles with Xanax but not Vyvanse. I even feed the ADHD story to her too. And every time she encourages me to be kinder on myself because of what I’ve gone through and recovery stuff, I just feel like a fucking fraud.

I don’t know a life without stimulants. I feel so physically and mentally dependent on them but the thought of not having it terrifies me 

Edit: Also just had the realization that it’s definitely the reason I find myself stuck in this depression loop.

So, going back a couple years ago I ended up homeless and on heroin and crack! This all lasted about a year, and iv been clean for a year now. It was the culmination of years of depression and suicidal thoughts. Years of hopelessness and zero motivation. Self medicating with weed turned into coke on a weekend, to taking codine and sniffing morphine  and eventually made its way into crack and heroin. 

It’s a long story, if your interested iv done AMA’s on here and even done a couple of videos about my story. But that’s not what I’m here for. 

When I was down in the dumps I had absolutely no1. Family left me and seen me as a lost cause. Friends I called family, left me to die out in the cold. Alone. 

It took me nearly dying to wake up. To finally realise I didn’t want this life. To find the strength to change. But, my problems didn’t stop there. 

In the UK there’s only one Organization that helps with that stuff. You can’t go to your normal doctor for substitutes, and the waiting list is months long. Obviously when you don’t know where your gonna be tomorrow, months away feels like a life time. 

At that time, I didn’t feel like it was a plausible option. I didn’t think I would be alive in a few months, never mind getting clean. In that few month waiting I had nothing and no1. I don’t want anyone else to be alone. I don’t want anyone to have to go through that shit alone like I did. 

So, I’m here to offer support. A sympathetic ear. Advice. A friend. Someone who cares! 

Iv learnt a lot over the past year. Iv picked up some epic tips and tricks to make things a bit easier. Iv learnt to manage my depression and anxiety. I don’t take any drugs or drink, aside from a little weed here and there. Iv learnt how to live healthy and happy. After nearly 30 years of existence Iv finally figured out how to manage. 

I would love to share my thoughts with you guys, and try help in any way I can. So hit me up if you could do with a mate to battle through the rain with you. I’m your guy. 

I want nothing from you. There’s no hidden agenda. No alterer motive. Just want to help out. Make it a bit easier. I just don’t want you to be alone! So hit me up:)

>Hi, Everybody,  
   
   
 I am Landon, a 63  y/o woman, disabled and determined to find the way to earn my living  doing what I love: blogging about my recovery, personal growth, and  crafting. I also want to return to school. One of my biggest goals is to  get myself off of welfare and out of poverty FOR.GOOD. If I can do that  for myself, I can help others too. That alone is an enormous need I  crave.  
   
 About my  background, I drank dangerously for 30 years of my life, stopping and  relapsing many times. I began my most productive alcohol recovery on  11-16-2007. Finally, I could no longer ignore the fact my life was out  of control and being drunk every day would not help me.  
   
   
 Back then, I did  not understand what was ahead of me. Raised in a monstrous household by  my sadistic psychopath mother, absent father and two older sisters who  were mother's thugs, it is a miracle I am alive. My childhood was so  abusive, I locked most of it up in amnesia and complex ptsd flashbacks. I  sat down one day to write out what I could remember: I wrote less than 3  pages, 8 by 11, Ariel size 11 font. Almost every memory I have includes  abuse. And because of those impairments, I became learning disabled.  
   
   
 Catapulted into  promiscuity, alcoholism, self-loathing, self-destruction, and more  because of that upbringing, my first therapist diagnosed me with  clinical depression in the early 1990s. Then, I realized how close I had  been to danger, plus my flesh and blood family were criminals. It  shocked me! I also remembered I had engaged in incest with three male  cousins who took advantage of my vulnerabilities. That happened when I  was around 13 and later in high school.  
   
   
 Decades after  that, I worked to better my mindset. I went to psychotherapy and AA  meetings. The therapy helped me more than the meetings. I respect folks  who benefit from AA because different people respond to different  approaches, but there are some aspects of AA that bothered me.  
   
 In doing years of  therapy, I got to the place where I could not figure out why I kept  sabotaging myself. It was on the floor staring at me; I could not escape  it unless I relapsed. I had to stomach what I ran from my entire life:  my blood mother and sisters hated me and tried to destroy me. I worried  what they pummeled me with was true: That I was defective and no one  would ever love me. That was what I ran from.  
   
 I had to undergo  hypnosis to get those stuck emotions going; that is how buried and  cemented in place they were. It took me weeks of listening to my  recorded hypnosis sessions 2 or 3 times a day to cry as much as I  needed. I saw firsthand how much better I felt when I faced and accepted  the emotional horrors that tormented me, the very horrors I drank and  drugged to escape. I was hooked and kept working on those issues and  anything else negative that bothered me. It is a TON of work, but I have  healed enough that now I can embrace the negative wounds to heal them  to the best of my ability. They are MY wounds; they are as much a part  of me as my toes and fingers are.  
   
   
 The therapy  took.me.YEARS. and I still have a ton of work ahead of me; recovery is  for life. We know that. That is how complex it is. But, for me, it has  also been *rewarding*  because I have a lot to be grateful for and am happy about. Slowly, my  mental health has gotten better and some of my physical health has  improved.  
   
   
 One last  important thing I want to share is when I stopped drinking, my over  eating worsened. (That is another chapter I will write about another  day.) And still not having most of the important needs met today, I  still struggle with overeating. I have gotten my cravings to stop and to  not bother me for weeks on end. I have lost up to 28 lbs during those  quiet periods, only to regain some weight back when the cravings  returned. I know the cravings return to compel me to get those needs  met. One way emotions work is to tell us something is off and we need to  fix it. And believe me, I am doing everything I can!  
   
   
 I know I can get  them to stop completely, and that is my focus. I am pulling together  every resource I have to get myself there: Satisfied with my life and  all needs met to the best of my ability.  
   
   
 So, all that said, I am glad to be here and am looking forward to making new friends!",68,0

It was not easy, we all just have to take steps to get there.

1. Practice Self-Respect

Often enough growing up, we are told to treat others with the respect that we expect to be treated in return. It is inevitable that there will be times where you are alone, so be comfortable with uncomfortable. Be the your own best friend. Would you be friends with someone who talked to you the same way that you talk to yourself?

2. Develop new coping mechanisms

I wish growing up that I had learned healthy coping mechanisms. My curiosity as a teenager was an unhealthy one and when shit hit the fan, I turned to whatever made me escape reality. I could not cope with situations happening in front of me, which lead me to bottling things inside. I wish I discovered back then how much I love to write instead of using to numb the pain.

3. Develop a support system

I always thought in life that we had to figure things out for ourselves in order to learn. It is a common perception and portrayal for men to be emotionless and stoic figures in society. To not let anything bother them and to put others peoples’ matters before their own. Help is there and always has been there, you just have to ask for it. The shame and guilt can be overcome, you just have to forgive yourself first before others can forgive you.

4. Give credit where its due

It does not matter how much clean time you have. Love yourself and be proud how long it has been or will be. One hour, one day, one month, one year, etc. Everyone is different. It is okay to be selfish in recovery and to recognize that you can be proud of yourself. You don’t need to be clean for a certain amount of time in order to gain praise. We all love and support you no matter the amount of time or attempts.

5. Stop talking and listen

“Addiction does not discriminate”, I’ll never forget the moment the judge said that to me in the courtroom. He had my life in his hands and for a moment all I did was savor his knowledge. He had seen countless individuals standing where I had stood before. Not only was it a powerful phrase, it had confirmed my reality and how badly my life had succumb to this disease. If you are talking, you are not listening. Do not listen with the intent to reply, listen to learn what people have to say.",43,0

My mom also shares this day with me celebrating 10 years sober from alcohol.,"I  don't have anything crazy inspirational planned i just figured maybe  some people struggling with addiction, of any kind, RCs or not could  benefit from seeing this. I'm also proud. I think it's pretty  fucking  rad.

I grew up with my mom being  an alcoholic basically most of my childhood, and she now officially  has  10 years sober from alcohol, and my stepdad will celebrate 10 years  in  December. (They met each other when they both had less than 6  months,  now happily married for almost 10 years) I started using heavier drugs  when my Dad passed away in my lap from a sudden heart attack and off i  went, finding my DOC being opiates, eventually becoming an IV drug user  at 19 years old.

I've also been on  Benzo's for nearly 7 years, So since i was 18, 2 months after my dad  passed in 2014. I still suffer from Panic disorder and am  still  prescribed Benzodiazepines, along with an SSRI, and other meds but i  take them as prescribed, if anything, less than I'm supposed to a lot   of the time. Which is my next goal to work on, because it's led to   collecting or keeping larger amounts as a ""back up"" which I know I don't   need but of course my brain tells me i do, but there's always  something  to work on. I got heavily into Clam, FluAlp, & FLubro for  about a  year to where i was taking Heroic doses of PG solutions at  10mg/mL several mL's at a time, and thankfully my prescriptions helped  get off  all RC's and anything else that wasn't prescribed, I didn't  think i  could ever get clean from the needle, **And i did**. Then i never thought i'd stop taking RC Benzos, **And i did**. I never thought I'd say the words ""I'm so proud of you mom, 10 years. And we share the same Sober date, I love you"" **And i did**.  I wish my dad was here to see me clean, although mental health is a  much tougher thing to overcome, chemical imbalances suck. But i like to   think it all happened for a reason. It prepared me for a lot of things   life threw at me, and allowed me to be ready for my next life adventure   currently happening, to be a Father, another thing i never thought I'd   become or ever be ready for.

Being  an addict doesn't have to be a death sentence. I'm not here to preach   at all, if you enjoy drugs, & see no problems, Enjoy. I'll be the   first to say drugs can be great. But anyone that knows that feeling of   ""I'm going to die from this"" or ""I can't do this, I'll never stop"" I   promise you, you can. I believe in all of you, just like people believed   in me even when i just thought I'd die a junkie piece of shit, and my   mom was ready to bury her son. But here i am.

Not sure why but i felt like sharing this. Much love to everyone 🤘",159,0

I haven’t had a drink since, the first six months were really hard; but I got through them.  I’ve become very comfortable with my abstinence from alcohol.  

What I’m struggling with now is benzo’s.  My doctor prescribed them to me a couple years ago.  At first they were great, I could take them as prescribed and they were like a miracle that made my anxiety melt away.  It’s not hard to imagine how this plays out.  I suffer from PTSD and I kept getting my doctor to up my dose and prescribe more, I would play up my PTSD.  Things really started to get off the rails for me last March, with the start of the pandemic.  My doctor doubled my does of klonopin.  I went on a binge and ran through my prescription in like a weekend.  I was so totally fucked up, and my wife was scared.  She reached out to my psychiatrist to tell them what’s going on.  So, what did I do?  Did I own up and work with my psychiatrist? No.  I found a new Dr.  who would prescribe.  Every time I got my script, I would eat them like candy, it was an obsession just like when I was drinking.  Ever time I got a refill I would tell myself that I could handle it, but instead it would turn into a binge, again just like when I was drinking.  About a month or so ago, I played up my PTSD and got my Dr. to up my klonopin and prescribe Xanax on top of that.  This last month needless to say has been difficult.  This weekend I got really messed up and my wife got so fed up, that we are sleeping in different rooms and she has been talking about splitting up.  

I need to move forward, I have had stretches of a couple of months without benzo’s and when I run out of my script, I don’t experience any withdrawal symptoms.  It is clear to me that I have to stop.  I need to come clean with my Dr.  I need to get back in with recovery groups.  I look at the past year or so as a series of relapses.  I’m still committed to abstaining from alcohol.  Now I need to commit to complete sobriety and leave the benzo’s behind, before it gets really reallly bad and I developed a physical addiction to them.",5,1

This thought came out as I was processing with a fellow sober mom. I have been going to three meeting a day AT LEAST! I have been listening to everything in my Quit Lit Hit Parade. I have been going to counseling once a week. I have been sleeping a ton. All things I would’ve been able to do in Rehab. We are not going to talk about my chores. The dishwasher is all I have been able to maintain.

But I have gotten to step of the crazy roller coaster of life. Well at least one foot anyway. My son has stayed at his dad’s for health reasons and he is symptom free and past his 14 days. But I have not had to worry about anyone else in the last 16 days. Well, maybe a little bit. But I am the only person I have had to keep alive. I usually have two of use to make sure that is happening. It is true what they say about being a mom. They want to eat dinner EVERY NIGHT! Damn! C’mon. Why aren’t you going for the cereal? There’s a reason I buy Froot Loops. Yes, I am that mom.

I am brought back to a post I had a few weeks ago where I was crumbling and this was 1 day before my Positive test and three days before I found out. Kinda like PMS when you’re bawling and then two day later, huh, imagine that? Sure enough, there is my period. So, maybe this was the answer the intention I put out in the Universe that night that I needed to step off the crazy wheel. Overall, it has been pretty mild, but lingering. It will not go away. I am back to day one with congestion this morning and sleep is back to being an issue. I still get tired easily when I do too much. I just unloaded and loaded the dishwasher and I am wiped.

I am finding my voice. I am still yelling to be heard, but baby steps. At least I am saying, “Listen.” I am near tears as I am sitting here. This has been incredibly alone. I am so thankful meetings are on zoom. I don’t think I could have survived this isolation without my communities I have built in SheRecover, Sober Mom Squad, and The Luckiest Club. If you haven’t already noticed, I am not the biggest fan of AA, but I love my chips. I just ordered a years worth of chips and sent them to my daughter so she can give me my chips.

So, today is 2 months. 2 months ago I knew. I knew I could never take another drink. I could never be her. I cannot stop at 2. They always turned into 2, 4, and 5+. I am not that person. The joy of 0% AF beer has been a plus in my week because just the action without the alcohol calms me. I kinda need to work on the Fudge Stripe Cookie thing and not place my next order. I need to limit myself to 2 and then move on to another self comforting skill.

Self Soothing. My counselor tells me to eat all the cookies after the hell I have been through. It is so weird to have another person here my story and feel bad for me and wonder how I survived, I am not sure what to do with his reaction. I have never really had anyone respond that way. I think about all the ways I have overcome my child hood and how I am not the mom I had. I have come so far, but when I sit there listening to his reactions to my story and reality, I am 7 years old and I just want someone to hold me and tell me my sister isn’t supposed to be hitting me as soon as mom and dad leave. That I belong in my family. And that I am wanted. And yep, there are the tears.",5,1

(sorry in advance for the novel),"really needing some advice. i don’t know if my drinking/drug abuse is “bad” enough for rehab but honestly i don’t know what to do anymore. 

2018 was spent drinking alone, and then when that stopped working i started abusing addy. in 2019 i got my hands on 2 scripts and although i was only supposed to be getting 30 pills a month (1 a day) my ass was granted 60. i started going thru 60 before the month was up and decided to go see a counselor bc i couldnt control how much i’d take anymore. i left my prescriptions with her and each week when i’d go to my appointment i’d get my weekly refill. 
after a couple months of that, she told me that she was moving to cali and gave me back my entire stash. since each month i’d have the 30 extra, when she gave me everything back i had in total 150 extra addys, on top of the extra 30 i was getting each month. i ran out in about 2-3 months and went thru 2 gnarly withdrawals. 
at that point i had decided to take an internship in another city and made a promise to myself to quit abusing my meds and to stop refilling my second addy script. once i moved things seemed to be going pretty well. i had one or two binges but that was that. i after a blackout one night i decided to go see a therapist and start going to AA. during this time i was still taking my adderall, but as prescribed. i stayed sober for a couple months but had a slip and drank a bottle. i thought i could jump right back into the program but my heart just wasn’t back into it so i left the rooms. i started to get real shitty anxiety (i’m diagnosed with GAD)  and was prescribed klonopin. i lied to my doctor and told him i was still sober and hadn’t ever taken klonopin recreationally before. it wasn’t long after that that i started mixing klonopin with vodka and my life started to get real unmanageable. i lost track of time. everything from the past couple of weeks seems like a blur, unreal. i was drinking and driving again, despite already having getting a DUI back in 2017. after i’d had enough and wanted to feel somewhat grounded again i quit drinking. i was sober for a grand total of 4 days until tonight. i thought it was a super great idea to snort some addy for some reason? people have thrown around the word rehab but i’m terrified of telling my family, maybe even having to move back home. 

i’ve managed to take my adderall as prescribed for months now without abusing it, and i haven’t taken more than my prescribed dose of klonopin (even though i had been drinking on it) i don’t feel the need to abuse my shit and/or drink everyday, but i’m still physically dependent on adderall and i know it’s probably not the best idea for me to continue taking my klonopin, (even though i am prescribed and am not taking more than i should) i can’t seem to stop. 

from the outside i think i put up a good front of having things together, but internally i don’t know what the fuck is going on. i feel stuck, my brain seems perma-fried and i’m sick of white knuckling sobriety most days. my drug/alcohol abuse seems so tame compared to my past bottoms so i feel almost weak asking for help. all i know is that i can’t keep going on this merry go round of shit. 

a lot of people have had a lot worse addictions than mine...do i really need rehab? i don’t know what else to do. any suggestions are welcome. thank u for reading my way too long of a post.",9,0

I got to 7 days of not touching opiates, thought I was doing pretty well dealing with some really stressful situations that cropped up and used a lot of my mental capacity. Then I decided to ""reward"" myself for coping well with a low dose of DHC.

I've used once more after that (yesterday) and I ordered more. Why the fuck couldn't I just leave well alone, considering how painless the actual physical part of my WDs were? But I don't know how else to cope. I already have severe, treatment resistant depression and anxiety that I take medications for. I am stuck with no one to talk to some days, and always stuck without someone to even give me a hug and tell me things will be ok. I'd kill for someone to just reassure me this isn't the be all and end all but it really feels like it, like I'm fucked up well beyond repair. I'm so far away from my friends right now due to the pandemic and I can't even be all that honest with them, but I could at least vent some of the negative feelings I have. But now everyone is at breaking point. My closest friends have their own mental health problems to negotiate, some even have small kids to take care off. I can't be their priority.

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to \*do\* with myself. It became so much a part of my routine, I'd go about my business, get some time outside, be at work part time, come home and enjoy a high. Just a gentle way to feel good and chatty. The major symptom of my depression is called anhedonia - the inability to feel joy or pleasure from things that would normally give you that dopamine boost. I feel like I've had to self medicate for years to make up for this inability to feel actualy content half the fucking time. Read a book? Can't get into it - can't even find the motivation to pick it up. Play that game you were enjoying just yesterday? Suddenly it's tedious and miserable. Smoke a little weed and listen to music? Why bother? The music's not right or the buzz isn't there or SOMETHING. Something makes it feel pointless and joyless.

&#x200B;

I should fucking learn - the ""hangover"" I'm getting from redosing smaller amounts of opiates is wrecking absolute havok with my mood and just encouraging me back into heavier use. I know it. And I feel like I can't do anything with this. Like I'm watching this train wreck in front of me and just shrugging.

My addiction is currently to lope.
For those who don't know, lope is short for loperamide, which is an anti-diarrheal medication. Its often referred to as the ""poor mans methadone"".
I have currently been on it for for nearly 7 years now and am currently up to 184 2mg tablets every 2 days.
This has caused several health problems that I now have to deal with. Including me having to get a pacemaker/defibrillator implanted into my chest. 

I have always wanted to get help for my addiction but several things prevented me from doing so. The main issue (the main concern I still have) is that no one will take my addiction seriously.

Now for a little backstory...
I recently lost my husband. He passed away very unexpectedly on july 24th of this year. He was only 34. His death was the worst of the many awful things we've endured this year (fuck 2020 amiright?).
He was also an addict(kinda) he was definitely addicted to opiates but he had a legitimate need for them and was prescribed them. He however, would also take the lope when he ran out of his pain meds.
His death was not addiction related (from what they could tell).
Right after he passed I become homeless. We were staying with his father at the time until we could save up the money to fix up a cabin on his father's property.

I feel I need to add that I suffer from many chronic illnesses. Because of this, I have never had my license. I also worked my very first job earlier this year. I'm 31.
I always had my husband to depend on for so much. I took care if our two kids and he took care of everything else. That's how he wanted it.

So, as soon as the doctors informed me that he would not make it, I knew I would have no where to live. His father is a terrible person. Without giving o out too many details, I'll just say that my husband was the only reason I didn't turn is father in for sexual harrassment.
So, with my husband gone, I am now broke, no license, no job and, no where to live. I have no family that cares about me apart from an aunt but she has no where for me to stay and only helps me because she knows its what my mom would have wanted.
I also recently found out, that the funeral home that held my husbands memorial is going to petition to become executor of my husbands estate (he had no will) because I haven't been able to pay the entirety of my bill. The purpose of them becoming executor is so they can liquidate any of my husbands assets to pay off the rest of the bill. The worst part is, the only asset my husband had was his truck, which is currently my home. I had made a go-fund-me to help with funeral costs but after they held the memorial, people assumed the bill was paid and stopped donating. I was pretty damned close too.
Not long after I learned my husband wasn't going to make it, I called SAMHSA. I was not sure what help I could get, all I knew was that I needed help. At the time, I told them my main addiction was to opiates. Which wasn't far from the truth. I've never been addicted to meth or things like that although I have had it.
The reason I told them opiates is also the reason for my post today.
I have always been given the strong impression that these types of places do not take loperamide addiction seriously. This is also something my husband used to tell me. He was once one of these people back before he began taking them himself who would say ""you tell them your on shit pills and they're going laugh at you"".

Back in early 2019 I was going to a suboxone clinic. This started after my husband and I attempted to self detox cold turkey for about 7 days. I'll elaborate more on that later. 
Anyways, when I told them I had been taking loperamide, the nurse first asked me why I thought that was an addiction that needed something like suboxone to ""cure"". She then repeatedly tried to tell the doctor ""she's only taking loperamide!"". They constantly downplayed it as something minimal and that I was ""crazy"" for putting my body at risk for something that ""doesn't do much if anything"" for opiate withdrawals. They also accused me of lying about taking so many saying ""that amount would have killed me"". 
Spoiler: it once almost did.
Anyways, I was able to get them to give me the suboxone after I told them I was only taking loperamide when I didn't have pain pills.
The suboxone didn't help though. I absolutely hated it. It made my legs hurt so bad and I constantly felt like shit. 
I had finally gotten to where I only had to visit then clinic once every three weeks, when I discovered a lump on my cervix.
I was diagnosed with cervical and lymphatic cancers shortly after and had to quit suboxone once I found out I needed surgery.
I am happy to say though that after a total hysterectomy and a shit ton of radiation treatments, I am now cancer free. Atleast, I will be 100% sure after I get my final PET scan.

Anyways, back to why I'm here. I have been putting off going to treatment until I could get mine and my husbands affairs in order. I had to find a place to store our stuff and find a place for my for my cat to stay. I also had to wait on his death certificate so I could be put on as executor of his estate and get the truck put in my name. However, after weeks of dodging my questions I learned that the funeral home had been deliberately keeping his death certificate from me until I paid the bill. It didn't matter to them that I made a constant effort to pay them and that I have it all almost paid off. It has gotten to the point however where i can't keep putting off treatment. The anti-diarrhea meds are getting extremely hard to find in stores and I have no money to waste buying them online.
So, I have decided I am going this week. Either Wednesday or Thursday. I just wanted to spend some time with my daughters.
I am getting increasingly afraid though, that they won't take me seriously.
I have gone through a few different types of withdrawls in the past but lope withdrawls are on a whole new level. When my husband and I went through them the week before I decided to go on suboxone. 
Its definitely not like other drugs. Most drug withdrawals can get better over time. Lope however just kept getting worse and worse. I felt worse than I had ever felt in my life. It plunged me into a deep depression and for the first time in many many years, I wanted to kill myself. It gave me extreme suicidal thoughts and i was having vivid dreams of my death. The only thing that helped me through it was my husband. Now he's not with me and I am afraid of what I might do If that happens again. Back when my husband was in the hospital I had to come home for two days. This was after they told me they pretty much knew he wouldn't make it. I had been so focused with staying by his side that I had been out of lope for about 4 days. Withdrawls had begun to kick in full force and all I could think about was ending my life. I was so ready to do it that I wrote my suicide letter, gathered up some important papers with my personal info on them for whoever would find my body. I made a plan to take take all of my husbands psychiatric medications and all of my meds and lay down and hopefully never wake up. I was ready to take them and then the phone rang. It was my youngest daughter (9) and she was worried about me. I talked to her for nearly two hours and decided not to do it just yet. 
The next day my husbands best friend dropped me off some lope. He said he knew I wouldn't be able to get to the store so he had ordered some for me. I took some and decided to hold off on ending my life.

Now I'm terrified that they won't take me seriously and won't help me. 
They've told me that I have to go to detox for 7-10 days before I can go into a residential treatment facility but everyone I have talked to at SAMHSA all say that they won't take me in if I've been clean for more than 3 days and I'm worried about them drug testing me because lope doesn't show up on standard drug tests. It has to be specifically tested for.
So, I am currently, nervously, counting down the days until I leave. I wanted to make this post to get others opinions and advice. I've never been to any type of inpatient treatment before. I'm also wondering if anyone has any opinions on whether or not they'll take me seriously. Its definitely got me nervous. I really need to go into an inpatient treatment center so I can get my life back on track and, so I can have a place to stay.
I have had many resource organizations trying to help me find a place to stay and they can't even find a shelter that will take me. The winter months are coming and I live in West Virginia, so living in a truck in the middle of winter is not a good idea. I was literally told by someone in my local homeless coalition that ""if you were a drug addict you'd get all kinds of help!"". Well surprise, surprise! I guess I'll be putting that to the test.
If anyone has any advice or opinions, I would love to hear them. Also, if any of you have been to an inpatient treatment facility I'd like to know what to expect. I know each place is different bit I'd like to get a general idea of what I'm walking into. Any help right now will be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Going into residential treatment soon for a loperamide addiction. I'm worried they won't take me seriously. Don't want to take suboxone or methadone.
I'm currently homeless with no money and can't drive. Just looking for advice or people's opinions. W pi old love to hear your treatment center stories and experiences so maybe I can get a feel for what to expect.",6,0

A little shaken up, just want to process.","Hey y’all. So it’s about 4am where I live right now. I work night audit at a hotel in South Florida. Just wanted to share and process what happened to me a couple hours ago on my shift. 

To make a long story short, I found a man, in his 50s, dead in his room shortly after I got to work. He overdosed on what I’m going to assume is fentanyl, because that’s all there is around here. It’s not heroin anymore. I could tell right away he’d been dead for a little while now. His BIL called the hotel around midnight and asked me to check on the guy, as he hadn’t heard from him all day and night. I get calls like this all the time and usually the person is either out of the room or asleep, so at first I was kind of like, sure whatever. And then he told me that he’s a recovering addict. I was like fuck. I know exactly why he’s worried. 

I call the room a few times, no answer. Go up and knock, no answer. So I go and get the master key, get myself into the room, and lo and behold, the poor bastard is dead on the floor in the bathroom. 

I’m in recovery myself, from heroin and crack. I’ve been in and out of the rooms for years. I’ve lost countless friends to the disease, including my best friend. I have OD’d three times myself, and thankfully am still here. And this isn’t the first time I’ve found someone dead; I found a roommate of mine dead in our bathroom a few years ago. So I am no stranger to death and the horrible realities of addiction. But this one is fucking with me. I just didn’t expect my night to go like this, you know? Night shift is always so boring. I didn’t even know the person, but I feel so sorry for him, and for his family. His BIL kept calling the hotel asking for updates, and I had to just keep telling him “the police and paramedics are here sir, we’ll update you as soon as we can.” But I already knew his brother in law was dead, of course. 

I’ll be fine. I hate to say it like this, but I’m used to people dying in the recovery community. But actually finding the person is much different than seeing a Facebook post about it. I’m gonna go to a meeting some time tomorrow and share about it. Just wanted to vent a little bit, thanks y’all.",40,0

* you'll lose everything again.
* you'll kill yourself by accident.
* you'll be broke and hungry again in and endless loop.
* the comedowns.
* others profiting off your weaknesses.
* inability to function.
* my nose will collapse.
* i'll get kicked out because i won't be able to afford rent.
* all the progress and results i've made will dissapear.
* everything i've worked towards will get destroyed in that single moment.
* i'll forfeit my reputation and self esteem.
* i'll dissapoint myself and others.
* i'll be so much further away from my goals.

two years ago, i relapsed at the 5 month mark and nearly died countless times for the next two years after that. i'm coming up on 7 months. it's not long, but it's the longest i've gone. we're given another shot at life, one gifted to us by God and ourselves. everything you've been through, all the pain, you can let it empower you and turn it into strength if you let it.

channel all the energy that went into addiction into writing your comeback. i believe in you.

I was an addict for over 6 years...I’ve lied and stolen from people I love. I feel guilt all the time for it. My love with oxy began when I got all four of my wisdom teeth pulled. I had heard that drugs were bad before but no one ever really mentioned the sickness. So I took home my script of oxys being a young dumb 17 year old. I was a senior in high school, the worst I had ever done is smoke a little weed. 

So I took 30 oxycodone 5s  home and I popped one. Holy fuck!! When I tell you the euphoria I felt it was amazing. To my depressed teenage brain the feeling they gave me was like sex...but better. Warm, fuzzy and numb all over like nothing in the world could hurt me. So I thought hmm one was okay let me try two at once. Even better I thought while I popped two more. I abused my script and so the seed was planted.

I wasn’t initially addicted to oxy until I started working an overnight shift at a local coffee shop. I was on a weird sleep schedule so my decision making way off. My buddy....who I thought was a buddy was having someone drop off oxy for him.  I was so depressed and I just remembered how good it felt last time. I needed to feel something...or maybe nothing. Or both fuck. 

It was an oxy 30...and my oh my did I fall
in love. The energy and confidence it gave me was through the roof. I was the best me I could be. I felt like no one could mess with me. So the cycle began and I started buying oxy 10s ...then 15s...20s.... then once the opioid crisis began the only thing typically around are 30s. So I did those for years. 

At one point I when I had a good job I was spending over 700 dollars a week on them just to not get sick. It’s a rough life for an addict.

Fast forward to now. I decided to get help after trying to quit so many time on my own. I swallow my disgusting addict false sense of pride and checked myself into detox. 

I pissed dirty for heroin even though I only did oxycodone. Fake pills are everywhere and they’ll look so good they’ll have you convinced theyre real. So seriously don’t be in denial. You’re probably doing heroin and you don’t know it. And if you are doing heroin I really hope you get the help you need. 

It’s day four and I have a long way to go but this is just the beginning. I pray for anyone going through the cycle and I hope you make it out before it’s too late...because eventually it’s gonna kill you.

I’m so positive about recovery. I know I can do it and so can you. Get help. Call your local SCADD.

I personally say fuck big pharma and refuse to take maintenance meds. I have suboxone and it started to feel like a cheap high. I dont shame you if you do. I personally know I’m strong enough. 💪 

Love you all and let’s get better!

Edit: So I haven’t slept in a couple days because I get terrible RLS. I found this stuff called biofreeze which is basically expensive roll on icy hot. Its brought me so much relief. My legs feel 90% better.

Thank you everyone for the love and support. It means so much and I’m so grateful for all of you.❤️👍🏽

UPDATE: Hey everyone, it’s been 8 days officially. I’m doing a lot better mentally and physically already. I do have RLS from the lack of dopamine production but my mind is more clear and positive than it’s been in years. My mind has just been blown by how kind of easy it’s been for me...even after all the failed attempts to quit. I think exposing myself to my family and friends has been huge in moving forward in my recovery. There isn’t really anywhere left for me to hide anymore.

Day 12: I’m still staying strong....I haven’t really craved anything because I’m so afraid to go through this whole ordeal again. Feels like this has been the longest most restless 2 weeks of my life....

It’s officially day 22 and I’m still going strong as ever. I’m amazed how easy it been. Physically I feel so much better. No chills, no rls, no discomfort. I haven’t really even craved going back to that lifestyle...I think I was finally scared enough for this to stick.",28,0

Normally I take drugs for fun and I'm quite good at keeping track and stop at the right time. This time is different tho. I got a new job, moved to a new city left everything behind and started to earn money. The problem is though that in the new city drugs are more common and I accidentally rented a apartment almost in the heart of the scene. As you can imagine the mix of new things, anxiety, more money than before, easy access and lonelyness mixed with the affinity of my gf for Heroin lead to some problems. We took it too long not thinking about the 3 days max rule and now we're fucked but need to function. I'm able to stay away for a few days but it's very complicated because I can't work while in withdrawal (running nose, deep depression, feeling like I should kill myself or everything is pointless / I'm worthless araise and it's a bad cycle. At the moment Im off since Sunday and it's manageable because of some benzos and stuff (I know I only take them as last resort for a few days to get away from it all)
So that's that to my situation my question is now I got some Heroin as well as buprenorphin and I'm not sure what would be the best solution to remain functional. Should I try to stick with the benzos for 1-2 more days and avoid opiates or should I take very small doses of Heroin to temper it down or should I do that but with buprenorphin instead of Heroin. I really want to be free again and (if I should take it again) I want to take it for fun again and never ever break my rule of the 3 days. I just want this odyssey to end and to get back a normal life. Happy job maybe start a family some day with my lovely girlfriend of 4 years but we both need to fix this problem and sort our life's out. Also I should mention she struggles a bit more then I do.
Any tips appreciated my thought is Heroin is faster in and faster out so it may be better for that but buprenorphin is better to dose and keep a steady decline of dosage. Thanks in advance

I've been starting to look for work and apply for a course to learn about counselling, but even these applications stress me out so much and I just want to run and hide. Facing the fact that I have nothing to show for my life for the last 10 years is pretty depressing. I feel like I'm starting from scratch. Even checking the mail gives me anxiety right now.

I’ve had to pay $80 just THIS WEEK for drug tests, all of my savings are gone due to paying my bond and regular bills so I’m broke as a joke right now. Truly. My last $20 is going to yet another “random” drug test today. I’m getting screwed so bad by averhealth 😂 

ANYWAY, two weeks ago when I asked my mother for gas money- she gave me a handful of nickels and told me to make it work. Today I told her I had yet another drug test this week and without me even asking she offered me “I have three $1s and some quarters if you need gas to get to your HA meetings tonight” 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Thanks mom, you totally rock! 

Trying to make it work, trying to figure a way, getting clean and sober, getting my kid back, one step at a time. Truly starting from the ground up but it’s the little victories that make me think things really might get better. Never thought I’d be stoked to put maybe $5 in my gas tank but HEY, it works if you work it!

-side note, I am working right now at our small town restaurant before and after hours cleaning and prepping the kitchen. But the owner doesn’t want me working during regular hours because my mugshot kinda went viral around our area and it’s “bad for business”....I’m just grateful he’s giving me the opportunity to work PERIOD. I’d literally shovel shit for any pay if someone offered right now. Lol",27,1

Today I am on day 48 alcohol free!,"I learned so much from that 52 days last year, even though I did end up relapsing mid November because I wasn't ready to on vacation that newly sober. I quit and started again multiple times in the past year. I tackled it from multiple angles this time. I'm seeing a therapist, did the 30 alcohol experiment on thisnakedmind.com to kick start it, joined Tempest, and have been exercising and journaling regularly. I feel so good now! The book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace is what got me started last year and I highly recommend it to help unlearn what we believe about alcohol.",80,0

Though there is one thing I've never been able to overcome alone:

It usually starts when I have a particularly bad day, for whatever reason. I feel like shit and start thinking ""fuck, maybe I should just get some (in this case) weed and escape for a bit."" I try to reason with myself: think about how bad I'll feel tomorrow, think of losing the progress I've made, think of how good life will be if I just stick with it. Sometimes it works, but sometimes I begin to obsess, and that's the point of no return. It's almost like my brain goes on autopilot and I'm right back where I started :(.

I'm sure many of you have had this experience before so my question is how do you overcome it?",3,0
