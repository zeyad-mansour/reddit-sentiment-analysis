And what are Alcoholics/Narcotics anonymous meetings like,"From birth it seems I was cursed with neglectful teen parents cursed with crippling drug addictions. My father was constantly leaving, going to jail, or doing drug deals around me. My mother had the tendency to get high or drunk and lay in bed all day. That or she'd lose her shit off a meth high while bouncing off the walls. She would constantly be gaining and losing jobs in fast food as quickly as possible. These days my father is in jail, has been for 8 years, and my mom is the same. The years of drug addiction has rotted her mind into a state of...schizophrenia? That's all I can call it, she has a paranoid schizophrenic brother and I think she may have it now after years of drug abuse. She is nearly unintelligible half the time, and I don't think I have the capacity to love her anymore. Both did so many drugs around me for so long and abandoned me in many ways. 

But this post isn't meant to air out all my dirty laundry. I am curious if a narcotics anonymous meeting can help me at all. I know it's for addicts or people in recovery, but I'd like to speak out.. I'd also like to know how the experience was firsthand, I am also a writer struggling to write firsthand a bit about my experiences, in some form anyway, in a story. Any suggestions would be helpful. I'd like to just improve mentally after everything. A different kind of recovery so to speak. Thank you for any contributions.",3

We talked about his life, and our stories were so similar, and I shared with him my experiences with what he was going through, and ensured him there is hope, and that despite going through very similar situations and having similar feelings, I had come out on the other side absolutely serene.

He asked me to be his sponsor the next day. Today I am going to his wake.

He went back out after about 3 months, and it was very clear that he just didn't want it. I had the tools held out for him, but he just didn't want to take them.

I've lost a lot of people in recovery, but this was the first dude who I genuinely reached out to. I experienced my first ""high in sobriety"" when reaching out to him that first day.

I relapsed. HARD. Monday night, after 5 whole months without touching anything.

Tl;dr: stay calm when you're in withdrawal because panicking makes you feel worse 

I've never been stable on my dose. I always run out early and I have to scramble to find some of these stupid strips before I get sick. I run out because i owe them out when i get mine and i always pay my people back because that's how you keep good friendships. It's a vicious cycle. Every new cycle I tell myself I'll take 1 a day but I take my suboxone compulsively, much like I did with heroin, even though i know more sub wont help. I know theres a ceiling effect and I know, in my brain, I fucking *know* taking more wont help me feel less tired or whatever it is I want to feel, but I didnt know that in my *heart*. I never absorbed that knowledge but now i have and I want to share what I've learned with you, here, who post that they're gonna run out two days early and are panicking. It had been a long time since I went into withdrawal, even longer since I went into acute withdrawal, but I've got a 4mg strip finishing up dissolving under my tongue right now after nearly 48 hours of acute withdrawal and, as I stand here with my tailbone aching, legs on fire, palms sweating and shivering slightly as I am wrapped in a heavy fleece blanket and fleece sweater over sweat pants and a tshirt, the blanket under my feet because the cold of my kitchen floor sends shivers up my spine, this is what I have learned:

#You need to stay fucking calm when you are in withdrawal.

Seems simple enough but I've been doing the opiate thing for 10 years and the suboxone thing for six and it wasnt until very, very recently that I realized it really is *mind over matter.*

When I knew it was coming and all my attempts to find more were becoming more and more unlikely to produce results, I wouldn't try to ration. I'd tell myself I would but then that addict in my head would itchy and squirm around and poke me and poke me and poke me until finally I took some just to shut my own brain up. Then I'd run out and as soon as it was in my mouth I was in withdrawal but that makes no fucking sense, right?

I always hated mind over matter. I hated that phrase because, to me, the withdrawal was real and it fucking hurt. If I felt even the slightest withdrawal pangs I would begin to panic which heightened my symptoms exponentially. If there was any delay in my getting more subs, I would fly into a rage. A friend making a pit stop after going to the doctor? She simply isn't answering her phone after she should have been back? (I am thinking of a particular person here and yes she was a shitty ""friend."") I would scream and throw things and then just collapse into sobs.

So I ran out Saturday and I tried all day and yesterday trying to find some. All my hopes were crushed when the plans fell through over and over. 

Sunday morning I had both my kids here. We were to go to church; it is a requirement of me for unrelated things. But I had to go and my kiss wanted to go because they like it. Desperately I searched my house, then my car to no avail. I could feel the sweats between my breasts and shoulder blades, making stepping out into the cold uncomfortable as the wind ripping through my clothes and coming into contact with my skin sent chills down my body in waves. My teeth chattered. I could feel my strength leaving my body so I warned my two young children to wait as I walked quickly, hunched over, several houses down and knocked on the door of my neighbor to beg her for something, even a little bit of sub. She gave me two tiny specs which I took and they gave me enough strength to dress my kids but not enough to take them to church. I took my oldest to her dad's and my youngest and I returned home where I curled up on the couch and took out *The NeverEnding Story.* which brings me to my next point.

#Stay busy

Physically you have no strength but you can keep your mind occupied and that's what I did. I didnt sit on my phone, browsing reddit. I sent my mind to Fantastica as my body was wracked with wave after wave of cold sweats and pain. Occasionally I would get a text message which would bring me to my physical being and I would get the full experience of the withdrawal but when I was reading I was able to mainly ignore it. I also watched televison: The Outer Limits. Basically you want to send your mind somewhere else entirely so you can get a temporary reprieve from the withdrawal. If you can get absorbed enough into what you're doing, you will forget how you feel physically. 

#Be kind to yourself

As I've already stated I'm a single mother. My kids are five and two and my five year old went back to her dads but my toddler couldn't go anywhere else as I'm all she's got. this is the hardest part for me to deal with because of the shame and guilt I feel that I'm simply not strong enough to push her on the swing, and the wind hurts me anyway. I feel awful that my toddler wants me to play with her but every time I try, my arms would lose all their strength. You aren't hungry in the least but your baby needs to eat. Needs changing. Needs you. As a single parent you dont get to take a break and I always feel like suboxone sickness isnt a legitimate sickness... like somehow I'm suppose to be able to push through it even though all my symptoms are exactly that of the flu and when I get the flu I don't beat myself up for not having the strength to play. I didnt have the strength to *parent.* 

I'm usually pretty careful with time and structure for my children, especially on a week night. Down for a nap by 130, no nap after that if she hasn't fallen asleep, naps only to 3pm if she does, at least an hour outside if its sunny out, dinner on the table by 630, bath time at 730 and lights out at 9 to be up at 6am for daycare/work. Very rarely do I let her use my phone and I spend a lot of time cleaning or playing one on one with her. I try to be as balanced as possible with the structure of her day.

*none* of that happened yesterday. By 130 the withdrawal was really kicking off and I was busy ripping my sweater off only to put it back on a couple of minutes later. I was walking around the house wrapped in blankets with my jaw chattering and trying to force myself to keep my muscles from staying in a permanent state of contraction (which is what I was doing as I read my book. I was subconsciously tightening all the muscles in my body and didnt notice until it started to hurt, then I would do a big stretch and almost pass out as the blood rushed to my head.) My daughter begged me to play and I did try but I was so weak and so cold I didnt want to move. I just wanted to be curled up on the couch with my mind in Fantastica and ignoring the sweat on my palms and yawning endlessly with one eye trained on the words on the page. I didnt have the strength to play, let alone enforce nap time. So, I put the back of my hand on my forehead and said to my two year old ""mommy sick. Do you want to watch a show on mommy's phone?"" Of course she said yes. At 3pm she fell asleep watching YouTube, and I sat on the floor in front of the couch with my book and doing my best to regulate my body temperature. She slept until 530 and then stayed up until 2am which has *never* happened. She held my phone the entire time.

Ordinarily I would hate myself for this happening but I kept telling myself I am sick and I am legitimately sick so I need to rest.

Luckily I have seroquel so I was able to sleep, albeit fitfully. My legs were in exquisite pain which Motrin only helped a little. When I woke this morning it was a few hours before I felt symptoms sinking in again. I sat on the couch and anxiously watched out the window for my neighbor to come. 

Some extra things:

-Motrin

-antidepressant or anti anxiety meds go a long way to helping you remain calm. Make sure you have been on it long enough for it to be effective 

-in the past I've taken flexeril for leg pain, RLS, and to help me sleep. I dont often see flexeril suggested as a comfort med

-a fan. I was able to regulate my temperature and be comfortable as far as sweats/chills go by curling up under a heavy blanket with a fan blowing on me.

-Benadryl can make RLS exponentially worse no matter how much you take

-stay hydrated and make yourself eat something because it will help as much as you don't want to eat

Most importantly:

**stay calm and do not panic because it *will* make you feel worse. Mind over matter is real. Withdrawal is temporary and not fatal**

Sorry for the novel. I just wanted to share with you guys my experience because I am the biggest baby when it comes to withdrawal and if I can manage it, so can you.",37

Hoping I am using this sub as it was intended. 
I typed this out on Facebook but thought it would fit better and hopefully reach someone here. 
Just to clarify I have been using meth for about a year and have always struggled with nearly every addictive substance I've tried. I am addicted to escaping my reality. 

Here is what I wrote:

Feeling such a deep level of peace and comfort tonight.  This feeling of relief is better than any substance in the world could provide. Just a couple of weeks ago I was so low I thought I would never come close to climbing out. 
 
If anyone is going through something they think will never get better, please please remember that nothing lasts forever. If you hold on and keep in touch with who you are, it will come. And that feeling of relief when you realize all the pain of getting out of that hole was worth it, when you finally feel at peace, man its a feeling that can't be comparable to any other. Today I woke up glad I didn't end it all, and after months of wanting to, I just can't describe how good it feels. Its a different kind of rush. I never thought this feeling would come and I had every reason to believe it wouldn't.",48

I have a little over 6 months clean, for not the first time, however this is my first time doing it with the program or a recovery based approach at all. In the past and for the first 4 months of recovery this time around, I had I just done it on my own which was just pure abstinent hell. With the program I feel it getting easier. My thing is I still occasionally use weed for anxiety and pain instead of taking my prescription anti anxiety meds or pain meds, entering into the rooms I didn’t know that weed was such a taboo. I tried to stop and didn’t have any success and wanted to use more than ever. I have talked to my sponsor about it and she thinks that as harm reduction method it is alright for me to slowly reduce use and taper off however I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame because I can’t share it with my home group and my recovery support family only my sponsor. Is harm reduction a better alternative or is cold turkey the way to go?",11

I know what your saying that was harsh but its what I needed and I went to rehab the same day and moved in with my sister while I was going.

A year later I met my SO. She has helped me not fall back whenever I have cravings and usually bribes me with food instead (not gonna lie I've gotten kinda chubby cause she's a damn good cook lol).  I also decided to end the night by asking her to marry me and she said yes!  

All in all I just want to let people know cause I am forever grateful to have my sister, my SO, my parents, my nephews,my brother (I guess) and my BIL in my life, they have helped me through all of this and I could never do it without them! I took them out to dinner (my SO, sister, BIL and my nephews). 

I want to tell everyone who has struggled with addiction is to keep going, its hard like really fucking hard.  But you feel much better and happier once its all over!

I had a good stretch, about a month and a half, and last night I fell off the wagon. I was feeling overwhelmingly depressed. It's a seasonal thing for me. I live in Vermont so its dark by 4:30ish this time of year. I work nights, so don't get to bed till the wee hours in the morning, and don't see a lot of day time in the winter. I had the night off, and my girlfriend was working, so I was alone, and just having an off day. I got weak. Today, though, is a new day. I'm very open to some suggestions for healthier ways to cope with depression. What would you have done? I do have some fallbacks of my own, and hobbies, like writing, which normally keep me busy. But when the depression really sinks in, when it becomes suffocating, it is difficult to bring myself to do things that would normally bring me joy. I'm willing to try some new methods.",7

Ugh) to go to on Saturday. Thankfully I stayed sober, thanks to some very good friends who kindly got me a Diet Coke every time they went to the bar so I wouldn't have to go up to the bar on my own, and checked in with me periodically throughout the night to make sure I was cool. However...

Since then I've been feeling invincible. Like, YEAH I GOT THIS. So much so that I decided you know what? I'm tired, I'm going to skip my AA meeting on Sunday and take a nap. And then today, I called out of outpatient rehab (which I'll also be missing tomorrow due to a sleep study) in order to clean the house (which, to be fair, I desperately need/needed to do because working all day and then drinking all night doesn't leave much time for cleaning). I've already done what I've done yesterday and today in skipping meetings/group, but I'm really nervous that I've gotten this taste of freedom (from rehab, since I literally have 10 minutes of free time between work and having to leave for rehab, and then get home around 15 minutes before bed) and I'll want more come Wednesday when it's time to go back to group.

Ugh, I was so freaking motivated all last week, making sure I got there on time every day (it's a little less than an hour and a half drive for me because of rush hour traffic) and planning to go to three AA meetings on the weekend (which didn't happen), etc. Now today I've even been thinking of bailing on rehab all together, even though on Saturday morning I was 100% certain that this was the right thing for me and I had finally realized how bad my drinking had gotten and how it had affected my life (previously, I was pretty heavy in denial). I definitely don't want to go back there, and I have exactly 8 days sober. How do I convince myself again that I can't do this alone?",1

Thank you all for your responses. I followed a bunch of your leads and my situation is vastly improved. This morning my loved one successfully boarded a flight in TN and arrived in NYC where he has been accepted into a one-year residential program. He arrived there with nothing but the clothes on his back. It was very stressful and intense actually getting him on the flight (I coordinated from Australia, with a recovery friend of ours in Nashville actually taking him). He created opportunities to obtain and smoke crack pretty much right until they headed to the airport. After getting lost wandering around Brooklyn looking for the center, he eventually arrived. We were on the phone the whole time. I was so relieved when he found it. Things didn't go to plan after that - after assuring us both the day before that they would take him as a walk-in and that they had a spare spot, he was told that they were full. So here he is by himself in a city he's never been to before, with no money, no friends/family, and a dying cell phone. Thankfully they took him to another local state-funded rehab facility and those people worked tirelessly all day on his case. They set him up with Medicaid and organized for him to start a 30-day rehab program starting Monday. They then took him to a local shelter where he could stay the next 3 nights. He's not gonna die, not yet, not alone on the streets; that's the only thing that matters. They are finding him a longer-term solution, somewhere to go after the 30 days are up. They understand he needs a long-term residential program. When I spoke to him a couple of hours ago he said that he was resting at the shelter and he was warm and he felt hopeful. He thanked me for getting him out. He's not in the clear of course, and won't be for a long time. But he is away from all his connections and triggers, and he wants to recover. That's all I can do for now. I think he has a chance.


ORIGINAL POST:
Hi Redditors in Recovery,
I'm gonna try to keep this concise. My loved one will be dead in the next few months if nothing changes. He is addicted to crack cocaine and has deteriorated a lot in the last month. He desperately wants to recover but he is so sick and his brain isn't working. Everyday crack wins. He said he can't keep trying and failing. His suffering is extreme. I know that he is planning on killing himself if he can't get some clean time, anything to suggest some hope that recovery is possible. I've sat with him counting minutes lately, forget days. Every 15 minutes he gets through without using is a victory, but it's also just a matter of time. No amount of willpower can sustain this. The cravings are so strong and his executive functioning so depleted at this point. There is no doubt in my mind that he will be dead within the next 3 months unless some solution we haven't thought of yet materializes. He WANTS to recover. He needs help. I don't know what will do it.

Questions for this community:
1. Does anyone know of a facility in the US that a person can stay in for months to get clean? He's got no money, no insurance. So it would have to be a not-for-profit I guess.
2. Has anyone had success moving states to recover? We're in Tennessee and there's fuck-all here for poor ppl - has anyone had success elsewhere in the country at a facility or recovery house that would be receptive to someone in my partner's situation?

He is a wonderful, kind person, intelligent, generous... He has dreams. All the windows are closing now. Any ideas???? Words of advice?? Thank you in advance.",5

2019-11-10 18:32:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/dujeoy/community_ground_rules/,Community Ground Rules,"Folks,

This is a pretty great community, and it's awesome to be able to be a part of helping keep it going.

Unfortunately lately this has involved a lot of actively removing posts and banning folks, which kinda blows.

So just a few points to remind folks what we are about here. This is a sub for folks in recovery to share their experience and strength with each other directly. Recovery isn't a narrow word for us. 12 step, lifering, smart recovery, buddhist practice, medical interventions, whatever is working for you might be something that helps others. We don't care if you have problems with substance addiction, food addiction, whatever. The general principle is inclusivity.

What we aren't about is being here to start arguments. If you think your thing is the only thing and are here to start fights with people who have found another path, then this might not be the best community for you.

We aren't about your youtube channel. That's not sharing directly with our community in our chosen forum. You want to talk with people on youtube, that's totally cool and probably really useful, but not what this particular sub is about. We are going to remove those posts and probably ban you.

We aren't about anything that looks like marketing in any form. Outgoing links almost always look like marketing to us. Your phone number to your 9-5 business looks like marketing to us. Mentions of specific treatment centers, ditto. This stuff is getting more and more subtle over time. Your AMA or constant opinion as an identified professional encouraging people to DM you is more complex, but while you might only have the best possible intentions and be doing everything pro bono, we can't sort it from predatory marketing so we are going to remove your posts and ban you.

Finally solicitations to studies. We were allowing these on a case by case basis, because good research is something that helps the whole community in the long run. But unfortunately we get inundated with these from students every semester and sorting the low quality student projects from high end refereed research from marketing cover takes way too much mod time, so we aren't good with those at this point either.

Sorry to have to write all this out and be so mod bossy about it. As we get larger we are attracting more of this stuff and every couple of days I have to go through and remove posts and/or ban people.

And most of this isn't coming from actual community members (which sadly means the offenders are unlikely to see this post). The vast majority of this stuff is coming from people who this is their first post to our community. Which is actually kind of awesome in some ways. We are still a supportive group for our members and those who wish to join with us.",119

Not going to lie, it fucking sucks. 49 days ago, the second day of my last run, I tried to OD since life has become too much. You would think 4 bars and a half gram shot would be enough to do the trick, but reluctantly I woke up the next day. 

I got arrested the next day for OWI since I was still pretty fucked up and was all over the interstate on my way to get some more cash to get more dope. My parents OR'ed me out of the drunk tank, with the contingency that I would immediately make the drive down to Louisville to a 6-9 month rehab program after I detoxed. I was in a haze and decided to go with them, mainly because detoxing in the drunk tank sucks ass and because I was under the impression it was a medical detox. Nope, not even an Advil or melatonin to help me sleep. 

Not going to lie, yeah I feel better than I did back in September, but the depression and longing to die are still very much prevent in my life now.

Any advice?,"I met my current gf the last days of 2017. In January 2018, after saying ""mom, help"", and acknowledging I had drug problems, I moved back in with my mom and grandma. I struggled for most of that year, not really wanting to quit, until my gf pointed to NA in October or November 2018. Now I've been in recovery for about a year. Stayed clean for 8 months, decided to drink, relapsed on cocaine again a couple times too because of that, and have been clean since. Almost 4 months now. 

Been living together with my gf who I met when I was at the lowest for about 9 months, and thing are not going great. Now things with her are not really that great, and even if she was a huge help with my recovery, I don't think we're being good for each other, and think maybe I need and want to not be in a relationship right now, since I still have a lot to figure our. 

If I did end the relationship (which we've been on the verge of doing for months now, with every stupid fight), I'd look for a place of my own, since I'm not feeling like going back to my mom's (she's can be overwhelmingly controlling, and I at the very least need my space to feel like I'm doing something with my life). 

Well, that scares the shit out of me. I think that there being no one around I'd feel less guilty or have less second thoughts about it and relapse in no time, or that I'd use the ""singleness"" as an excuse to ""party"" and convince myself I can handle it. Like I have before, us addicts are great liars.

So, that. Sorry for the messy post. Feeling like a mess tonight.",2

This is my 6th moth completly sober and it has been really hard, the first two months were rough because i was graduating for collage and being unemployed and not knowing what to do with my life made my have a lot of extreme anxiety attacks apart of being in my room all day doing nothing, it was like a cycle. I used to do drugs because i was bored, bored of everything and naive and i needed something exciting and in a way i couldn’t numb the pain or toughts that i was feeling in that moment. For the most part everything has been great for now, i’m starting to do excercise and i’m doing a great job at keeping my mind occupated and my anxiety for the most part i know how to control it by breathing etc etc etc. But THOSE days when you’re emotional for some reason and lonely sometimes you feel that toxic trait coming back behind you like “maybe if i take one pill again i wouldn’t be that bored” idk being a recovering addict sometimes gets really dark. Also i’ve been thinking on going to N.A meetings just to talk about my past and heal it because i’ve never been to rehab, mostly i’ve stop because of myself but sometimes i feel like i need to talk to someone that understand that shit to let go and close the door.

This morning, 3 weeks post first arrest, I opened the my front  door to step outside for a moment, my cat bolted.

I know this may not seem like much, however, after having my cat live with my estranged girlfriend  for nearly a year and finally getting myself in a spot where I could care for an animal, I got her back.

Most pet owners know the feeling of having a pet you cannot care for, and upon getting her back my love for her grew more than I thought possible. Long story short, this cat is the only thing on this planet that I cared about more than  myself.

Now, she is out in the streets of Terre Haute and I have not stopped crying since 8 this morning (4 hours). After frantically running around outside with no shoes and shirt in the 35 degree weather we are having, I lost sight of her.

Since my arrest, I have finally decided to cold turkey everything  and it has surprisingly gone  really well for me.  Haven't even wanted a drink until this morning.

The most important part of my life is missing and gone and it is all my fault and I have never hated myself this much in my 29 years on this planet.

The only thing I want to is to drowned myself in liquor and not come out of the pool. I have never wanted to drink this badly in my life. Not during active addiction, not during a get together with the bois around a bon fire, not even at my brothers naval graduation.

I am maxing out my personal scale for wanting to drink.

But, I know that if I sit down at a bar, or go grab a bottle and sit down here at home and start drinking, that is time that I am not looking for the most important thing in my life. Which makes me realize just how important my sobriety is as well as how little drinking will help.

I can taste the whiskey in my throat.

Whatever your reason for staying clean and sober is, hold on to it and let it drive you to and past what you thought you could handle without substance.

My name is u/uneeknaymuh and I am an alcoholic, and if you will excuse me, I have a cat to find.


And if you needed to hear it today, I love you and you do not need to pick up.


UPDATE: 815 EST- I found her and she is back at home, a little hungry and now asleep under the bed. 

As rough as today has been I didn't pick up and I am glad that I was sober for the reuniting. 

Thank you too everyone for their positivity, kind words and wisdom. Life is full of things that make us want to not feel. But feeling those things is the lesson you learn from life, and if you are numb to them all the time you will miss out on the majority of the point of existence in the first place. 

Another day sober is better than the best day using. 

I love you all.",78

Every time I would try to quit in the past I would relapse because of the exhaustion I would feel during recovery in sobriety. And also the anxiety.. mainly towards the morning/ early afternoon time is through the roof. I started drinking when I was 20 because of social anxiety and I used it as a social lubricant. Little did I know I’d become a full blown alcoholic by the age of 26. I couldn’t hold a job to make a long story short and I pretty much flunked out of college even though I was such a promising student on my first few semesters. I pretty much just wouldn’t show up for classes because I’d just be getting drunk or I’d be so drunk I wouldn’t get homework done etc. However, luckily, I got back into a different college and I’m doing okay. I really feel like I can stay sober this time but like I said the fatigue and anxiety makes it so hard. Sorry for the long rant, but how did any recovering/recovered alcoholics on this forum deal with the anxiety and extreme tiredness during early sobriety? How did you guys ignore the urges ? Any advice would be appreciated",55
2019-11-05 12:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ds2chq/day_2holy_crap/,Day 2...Holy Crap,"Hi, all! 

So I'm an anxious future planner...I get anxious about the future, so I spend my free time planning every minute of my life for the next infinity years. Of course, I'd get anxious about THOSE plans so the next day I'd come up with a NEW plan, etc. I never followed through on these plans, and eventually figured out that if I drank enough, I would be able to quell the anxiety and not care as much that my life wasn't exactly like I planned. 

Yesterday was my first day in an intensive outpatient program. I've tried to get sober before on my own which obviously didn't work, and when a brand new psychiatrist who I'd never intentionally talked to about my drinking (but I guess it's so normal to me now that I talk about it without realizing it) called me out and suggested I get help. It was like not realizing you're drowning until someone throws you a life preserver. So here I am. Day two. Made it through day one by the skin of my teeth, but I made it.

The problem is, now my future anxiety is ramping up, and I want to plan everything about my sobriety. I want to do it perfectly. I have to attend 3 AA meetings a week? LET'S DO FOUR. I have to find a sponsor? LET'S DO IT TODAY. But I feel like with the former, I'm going to get burned out, and with the latter, I have no fucking idea how to find a sponsor because I've literally attended like 3 AA meetings in my life (and two were probably when I was a child and my mom would take me to AA meetings while she was drunk). I never went back because I always felt like I needed more guidance (because knowing exactly what I have to do would help me plan plan plan). 

How do I stop future tripping, take it one day at a time, and figure out how to do the things I need to do to stay sober?",5

I am on methadone.  Ive been off heroin and meth for 2 years now.  I'm almost 6 feet and still only weigh 130.  Shortly after getting off dope my weight went up a little bit but back down.  My teeth are real bad and the pain makes it hard to eat big meals but I still eat.  And like lots of people my diet is not the best (lots of sugar and candy from cravings due to methadone) but Methadone is k own for making one gain weight not lose.  I do have a fast metabolism but this is ridiculous.  I'm so skinny.,2

I have borderline PD but not diagnosed bipolar. 

Has anyone else experienced this, and how do I deal? Just try to tough it out? Don't want to just switch to another medication, whether weed or prescribed 'calming' drugs. But also don't want to tank my life by the mental illness route either. 

Is this a known phenomenon with an expected duration? Because if there was an end in sight I'd be less afraid to endure this.",8

Her daughter, got off the dope two years before I did and was a role model for me to get off. I have been in recovery for over a year now, so I finally feel comfortable hanging out with her because I didn’t want to relapse and take her down with me. She is an amazing mother and we took our kids trick-or-treating together in her neighborhood this year.
   Now, she is not the gift, but rather she has it too. It came to my attention when the rain started pouring I mean POURING, while we were at least a block away from her house. Had I been out with any female friend, or family member it would have been a miserable experience. However we both looked at each other like, “oh well , we have walked in the rain before” and we just got our kids home quickly and efficiently. It was that GRATITUDE for life that is only known by people who have seen such fucking horrible lows in life. I grew up with a mom who had like mini 10 sec break down (I’m guilty of this during THATtimeof the month) if we spilled cereal, she needed to get gas, the vacuum came unplugged while using it.  This set me on a track of constantly trying to cushion the mood of everyone around me at the expense of my own since childhood. I am healing these behaviors in my recovery, but It felt so nice to be around another woman who has learned to just handle issues as they arise without that mini temper tantrum. It was refreshing. Now I just have to try not to develop too serious of a girl crush.",30
