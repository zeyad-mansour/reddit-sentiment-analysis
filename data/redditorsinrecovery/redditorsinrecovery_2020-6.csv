I’ve been trying to quit on and off for about 6 months now. With coronavirus and being quarantined that went mostly out the window a lot of days and I fell into deep holes. This weekend me and my partner broke up, and going back to live with my parents Lost control the next day and they threw away all the bottles in the house. I had been 3 days abstinent today when I remembered there’s a gallon of industrial 70º alcohol in the kitchen that they bought for cleaning supermarket delivery and I mixed it with some juice and downed it in one go. I really just feel horrible about myself as I’m writing with sweats and shivers unable to sleep. I feel like throwing up just from sheer panic. I know it’s not like drinking car ethanol because the industrial quality won’t allow for any methanol in these high-grade products, but now I’m so scared that drinking car alcohol won’t be beyond me someday if I can’t stop soon. 
	I know I haven’t gotten to the point of screwing up anything in my life yet and I can only thank god for that. But we never know when that can happen, right?
	I just really needed to get this off my chest. 
Thanks in advance for any advice you may have to give in support.",11

I’m 21 F, around 135 lbs and for the past 2-3 weeks I’ve been doing between 2mg-4mg Xanax daily. Well, 3 days ago I ran out and decided that I was done. The first night after I quit I felt no adverse side effects, but last night I started to feel them. Cold sweats, body tremors & aches, and anxiety. This morning I woke up feeling extremely nauseous and had to leave work early. Had no appetite all day until around noon when I was barely able to eat a small burger. Now I’m sitting in bed and I feel like the room is spinning, my brain is very foggy and it’s hard to focus. I guess I’m just looking for some insight from others who have gone through this process. If anyone has any tips to help the symptoms I would love to hear them. Most of my symptoms so far have been physical, the only mental symptoms have been brain fogginess and anxiety.",44

2020-06-27 16:23:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hh0ria/psychosis_recovering/,Psychosis? recovering?,"not sure if this is the right forum to post to... Im afraid this might be a long post so if you read... I appreciate it. 

Ive been seeing someone for a while now, and im not sure if you guys know anything about cannibis or alcohol induced psychosis or meth.. But he has used all before. Currently he only smokes cigarettes, weed, and drinks beer. I am not a psychologist- but i do work in the medical field and the signs im seeing are pointing directly to psychosis or something along that line.. 

If he drinks or smokes pot.. he becomes so different within a half hour to hour afterwards. he starts thinking that he is dead, he asks me if this is even reality, if we are even here. And then if i say youre not dead, this is reality, he will say “how do you even know?” 

Or he gets paranoid- wont let me touch him because he thinks im going to inject him with something. ?


Theres some things i dont know about his past, but he was in prison for 6 years for grand theft (which he returned the car cause he didnt realize he took the wrong one...thats a whole other story) But his sister has been very vocal saying he has been different and like this since he got out 5 years ago. she does not think this is drugs. 

He has told me some stuff when hes been drinking/smoking but im not completely sure of the whole truth.. He has said things when he gets into these episodes like “i wake up and some dudes on top of me and trying to stick it in me” but he shut down and didnt say anything more. He has said stuff like “well i dont believe counselors are real, maybe some of them, but they just inject you and try to control you” 
sometimes in these episodes he has said “idk what youre gonna do, my privacy has been raped my whole life and who knows im sure ive been injected before” 
or he will just start becoming paranoid about my phone. He doesnt like the camera, so i have tape on my camera on my phone when we drink or if we smoke. I often dont drink with him because he changes so quickly.. i mean 2-3 beers and he is spiralling. He starts taking things apart, he starts destroying the house... nothing he says makes sense. He will start saying random numbers, or just say something weird like “oh yeah i remember nickel” like what?? and ill ask him what he said and he doesnt even know. These episodes havent ever got physical and hes never hurt me. hes raised his voice once and said that i was selling my soul to the devil? And he has hit himself in the face before and called himself a f*ck up. 

I just dont know what im dealing with. I know that he did meth a while ago- but his response to me about it was that he did it and a bunch of bad stuff happened when he did it, and he said he couldnt work and he thought the government was after him, and that he had a really bad experience where he locked himself in the bathroom and took a screw gun and screwed the door shut. (im not sure when this experience/story happened) To my knowledge, he isnt on meth. I mean i see some similarities in these episodes, but if hes not out of my eyesight and i literally watch him change and have these episodes... I mean i dont have an explanation.. I mean theres often times where he grabs my hand and wants me to come pee with him. and other times he is scared of me touching him. And the sex- he is very feely about it. Like he considers it very “special” so in the past few months we have only had sex once, ive given him 2 BJs, and then recently we started having sex and he had been drinking and he stopped right in the middle and put his pants on, grabbed me and said “i wanna make sure we want to have kids first before we keep going..” Which i respect very much-but i keep thinking something is wrong with me where he doesnt find me attractive or something.. like sometimes we have seen each other 3 days in a row without a kiss or even hug because he will say “i dont know you what if you inject me or do something to me” (after hes been drinking and smoking weed)  But he always tells me im so beautiful and how much he likes me, and hes let the word Love slip out a few times. 

I am just at a loss here. Ive mentioned like the psychosis thing and he just jokes about it and says “oh so im in psychosis or im a schizophrenic huh” and then tells me im trippin. Lol 

I mean i know that he has done meth in the past, his old roommate did it and it was a big reason why he kicked him out i guess. But he doesnt talk much about his past with me. Anytime ive brought up the question if he is doing meth or something, he says “you asking me this makes me wanna go do it, that stuff is no good” But its like i know theres 2 people that he is kind of friends with, doesnt see them often but they are meth addicts and his ex girlfriend did meth. He said thats why they arent together- because she needs to be sober. But i dont know how else to explain how he acts.. but its like when would he be doing it? Because if we sit down, open some beers and he is on the couch, hasn’t moved, he was in the car and the store with me when we get beer, and then after a few and few hits of weed he starts spiraling like this? I found one meth pipe when we were cleaning out the house because the back part of the house is kind of destroyed- had to replace the floor and stuff, there was a meth pipe back there and he just shattered it and said “well thats bullshit- i need to get everything in this house cleaned” . Which he kind of has a hoarding issue and he knows he does and so does his family lol— but none of this family seems to have these issues or have ever done drugs- they all seem pretty straight&narrow, all catholic. But yeah..Then like a week later we found like some 14 inch dildo hahaha and he was like “did you put this here??” and it was kind of a joke but then he said “theres so much stuff back there i dont even know about in my house, is this even my house??” 
As far as i know he hasnt used meth since like 3 months ago. He said he tried to do it, and he never wanted to experience it again. So im not sure what to think of that. One time he said something like “i could do dope once a month” and he giggled and im not sure if he was being serious or not. 

But how do i explain these changes that happen? we spend every day together, but we dont always have sleepovers because if he does smoke weed even if he doesnt drink, he gets weird about me being there and doesnt “trust me” enough yet, but he can sleep at my place easily... He sleeps about 5 hours a day. Usually about 1-2hrs hours after he gets off work at 3pm, at my place (my AC works) then he sleeps from about 2am to 6am. 

I just don’t understand how he can be completely normal- drink a few beers and roll a blunt and suddenly he is delusional pretty much. I wanna say its meth- but its just not clicking for me. Especially because its not like he gets weird about the govt or is taking everything apart or anything. He just gets literally delusional- questions life. Will list off a string of numbers randomly. Will say things that dont make any sense and i ask what he is talking about and he doesn’t even know. He will mention a past moment or something, then will go on a rampage about someone hurting his family idk its so confusing.

I care about him deeply, but i just dont know what im dealing with here..",2

Not that I attend super regularly nowadays, but I’m still there every month or two. But anyway, I work for a state mental hospital. I’m in the medical records department, basically doing filing and maintaining charts. I work on a unit, near patients.

Now, the place I work, most of the patients are here because they pleaded Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity. Everyone here is committed by the court. 

In the course of my work duties, I see everything about these people. I read their stories, how they were arrested. The particular unit I’m responsible for is 53 guys, (it’s an all male unit, but other units are female) and every single of of them was intoxicated when they committed their “Instant Offense” (that’s what they call whatever you did to have to plead NGI). 

Every single one of them. We gave maybe 10 guys out of 53 that were on their third strike, so they copped a NGI plea to avoid 25-Life under “Three Strikes” laws, basically by exaggerating their symptoms. The rest have various degrees of schizophrenia and  schizoaffective disorders, and more than a few developmental disabilities.

But all of them were high or drunk when they got arrested. A good percentage had been on medication and then stopped, either from neglect or inability to obtain treatment. Some were using drugs to self medicate. 

It strikes me how easily I could be in their place, all the times I was out of my mind on some mix of chemicals and did something crazy. Sometimes I think how easily I could have ended up somewhere like this, until I realize, we’ll, I **did** end up here, I just get to go home every night. 

It seems really telling to me that none of these guys ended up here while they were sober, while they were working a program. 

I don’t know for sure what any of it mean, I just wanted to share. Thanks.",6

There is no such thing. I realized that last night when I had the best high of my life and then that was all I could think about for 24 hours.

I used to be addicted to dilaudid for a short period of daily use. Was clean for over four months, had a one time relapse when I found some tramadol, and then relapsed again at the beginning of this month when I got into my mom's safe and swiped a bottle of oxy. I told my partner about the initial relapse, but didn't mention that I was using once or twice a week since.

Because I was freaked out that I was so focused on my high from last night, I confessed to them that I'd been using. We had a long talk and they were very understanding, but they told me I had to flush the pills. It took me an hour of internal arguing to do it. I got so anxious about it I started getting a migraine and thought I was going to throw up.

But I did it. I flushed em. All 15 and a half pills gone.

And I immediately regretted it. I can't possibly get those pills anywhere else. They're from 2013, they don't even make those kind anymore. I'll never experience that high again. Ever.

Opiates have been my fall back for whenever my PTSD got bad. If I had a day where I was just irritable and angry, I could snort 5mg and feel that warmth and go back to being talkative and happy again. It's an easy out. I want it back already. I almost saved one just so I could have one more high, and I so wish I did. I am so angry that I just wasted all of those meds. I know in the long run I would've fallen back into a pit, but trying to cope with my trauma without that crutch is just so much harder. Pills take the weight off my shoulders and let me just relax. Weed just can't do that for me. 

I know I'm just scared of change. I don't want to stop using. I don't have any intrinsic motivation to do it. I just don't want to hurt my partner, because they were an addict themselves and they know the struggle and have helped me through withdrawals and everything. They deserve better. I just can't find a way to believe that I also deserve better. And that's why I've relapsed. And that's why I don't know how long I'll last.

But I guess I just have to take it one step at a time for now. One day clean.",72

A month ago he came to me in a paranoid panic and admitted to me that he'd been using for about a year. We got rid of the drugs and I spent the next 7 days detoxing him. Around the end of the week he started expressing that he needed some space and time alone to process. I tried to give him that in the following weeks but he ended up going off the rails much worse culminating in a cross province paranoid binge about a week ago. I've been staying with him while he detoxes since. 

We've got in touch with addiction and mental health supports and have some phone calls this week and want to look into residential recovery programs.

The problem is that he's starting to express that he's going to need some space and time to himself again. As an introvert I totally understand how that could be important and even necessary in his process of recovery but I also know I can't really trust him at this point. I'm terrified of leaving him alone but I also know I can't force him to get clean either and if he truly wants to use it will probably happen.

I am a 32 year old male and I've been, in the language of the politically correct, physiologically dependent on opioids - in various forms, it's all the same junk - since the age of seventeen. By age twenty five I had comfortably come to terms with the idea of long term MAT w/ methadone or suboxone - with being a ""lifer"" as they call it. MAT has always worked well for me and allowed me to live to my fullest potential. Due however to the policies of the programs themselves and to my own transient pattern of living (residing back and forth between two different cities but in the same state, Michigan) I've gone through multiple MAT providers over the course of the last decade. 

For the last two years I've been paying a sickening amount of money out of pocket at the pharmacy mind you for a medication that my health insurer (Medicaid) should be paying for. The trouble is with Medicaid's Benefits Monitoring Program - It's basically like the police department for doctor shoppers and other insurance plan ""abusers"". The BMP has me ""locked in"" to a doctor 150 miles away in Grand Rapids and will only cover Suboxone prescriptions by this doctor. 

The irony in this should be apparent....

But, cool, whatever, easy fix right? 

Well, starting about two years ago, each time I would go to the pharmacy and try to have the RX billed through Medicaid, I would hear the same song and dance - ""You're 'locked in'. You need to call Medicaid and change your provider; here's the number yada yada"" 

And so became the routine that I would call Medicaid and ultimately after going through one or two or three or so support people and explaining a problem which I myself don't understand to each one of these people, I'm transferred to the Benefits Monitoring department. Seems like it's been the same guy answering for the last two years, and each time they/he point(s) the finger to ""United Healthcare"", my direct plan provider but this is through Medicaid (don't ask because I don't know). So... I call United Health and come to find out Suboxone is what they call a ""carve out"" or ""green card"" medication, meaning it's something that MEDICAID pays for. NOT United Health. As such, I must contact Medicaid. 

I contact Medicaid.... 

Eventually I'm brought back to the Benefits Monitoring department. Same damn guy... Talks to me like I'm a complete scumbag, system ""abuser"", ""doctor shopper"" what have you and tells me the same thing he did before - to contact United Health.

After about a year and dozens upon dozens of hours of repeating this cycle I gave up. Relapsed. Started drinking too. Made a dumb decision and ended up incarcerated for seven months...

Now I'm out. I was released from jail two months ago and I've been doing everything in my power to get my life back together. I started MAT again last month - living now in Traverse City Michigan - and I'm now dealing with the same issue. I'm unemployed at the moment (restaurant work is my occupational forte) and I'm having to rely on the help of my family and the kindness of strangers (I play guitar on the street) for an essential medication to which as I understand it I am fully entitled as a Medicaid recipient. 

This feels wrong on so many levels. I have contacted the bureau of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs - It's the number provided inside of that ""Know Your Rights"" packet. I'm still waiting to hear back, however, the team there that deals with these complaints are a part of a funding entity called NMRE which is essentially Medicaid's b\*&#% - you can see how I might not be too optimistic.  

The whole thing is extremely KAFKAESQUE. In fact I cannot think of a better word.

I feel like the only other route to take is a civil suit - Seems clear to me that compensation is in order (all that money that myself and my family have paid thus far while the insurer just bullshits me, sends me chasing unicorns). If I do end up having to go this route I'll need an attorney that works on contingency, as I have no money.

How can Medicaid be held accountable? I do feel that my healthcare recipient rights are being violated, in some way, and I do feel this is discriminatory. I'm also POSITIVE that BMP and the representative who is answering my calls in that department are in the wrong.. What do you think? I'm at a loss.",4
2020-06-22 11:24:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/hduby6/do_the_lives_of_addicts_matter/,Do the lives of addicts matter?,"Ignore the title, I probably should not have chosen that phrasing. Anyways, it is a provocative question, so I am being provocative, and reading it has probably made you uncomfortable. You want to reflexively answer in the affirmative, but there is a whisper in your ear that won’t go away: maybe their lives, don’t, in fact, matter. Maybe they deserve whatever suffering comes their way.  Maybe the world would be better without them. 

I will grant you that last one, in that the world would in fact be a much better place if addiction, and addicts, didn’t exist. But they do. The various realities of biology, pharmacology, and simple, basic human nature have always, and will always, conspire to make addicts out of a significant proportion of all human beings. The consequences are tragic, and our general reaction, as a culture, to these consequences: also tragic. 

We generally treat addiction as a monstrous character flaw, and addicts as untouchables. But addiction is not classified as a personality disorder (notwithstanding the fact that one should also be able to have compassion for those unfortunate enough to afflicted with one) - it is a mental illness. The brain is, ultimately, a very sophisticated piece of meat, and having a thinking brain is not analogous to being a little homunculus driving a body - our brains are susceptible to unasked-for illnesses in the same way that our bodies are. The question of whether we truly have free will in the first place is one for people much smarter than me to debate, but no one can deny that given the uncountable number of variables and processes that go into making a mind, we are not as in control as we like to think we are. I like the analogy of a brain tumor. If someone were to develop a mass in a certain area of the brain, and their behavior began to change dramatically - to the point that they were essentially a different person - wouldn’t they be a victim deserving of compassion? They might become impossible to live with and hard to understand, but they didn’t choose to become that way. So, when basically the same thing happens to people suffering from a mental illness, through more mysterious  but no less physically real processes taking place in the brain - why do we react differently? 

So, if you can accept the fact that addicts are in fact suffering from a mental illness (one among many, as is most often the case), and that they are not simply people who have thrown caution to the wind and decided to yolo with the best of them, what does that mean for how we treat them? Haven’t we decided that it’s monstrous to see someone in pain because of an illness  and to ignore them? Wouldn’t it become monstrous to see someone suffering from some invisible compulsion - something that if they could only find the off switch for, something that makes them crave a time machine -  to see them and to ignore them? Wouldn’t it be be wrong to decide that whatever dreams they may have had, whoever they may have been before or may yet become - that these things don’t matter anymore because they chose their lot? 

This isn’t just a problem when it comes to addiction. It applies more or less to all mental illnesses, in that even though science has been telling us for decades that these things are in fact illnesses, we can’t resist assigning some value judgement to those afflicted. In a way, I think it’s a protective mechanism, because if you believe that mental illnesses only happen to those deserving of them, you can convince yourself you’ll never get one. That’s understandable, if misguided. What isn’t understandable is that, even in this age of supposed mental health awareness and supposed compassion for those suffering, I, and many others, still feel ashamed and terrified about how others might react. And rightly so. I still catch myself judging people who seem really down and out, even though I know better, so I can only imagine what other people must think. The culture is saturated with the idea that people suffering from mental illnesses, and especially addiction, are dangerous - that they are bad, irredeemable villains who are just reaping what they sowed. 

And sure, some are dangerous. And some are a drain on finances and emotions.  I was never quite dangerous myself, but I became preternaturally manipulative and I hated every second of it. But that is the nature of this illness, and we seem to be able to tolerate the bad things that come with the physical ones, and mercifully, some of the more palatable mental ones, because we recognize that no one chooses to become ill. 


Deaths resulting from self harm and substance abuse are the two top causes of death for 15-49 year olds in the U.S. One in four of all deaths are ultimately attributable to alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. So, did these lives matter? We certainly don’t act like it. And who is the monster - the person suffering, or the society casting them out?",4

I had to write a goodbye letter to my daughter who is 5 years old, because I was going to go back to using and probably die. Here it goes

-Audrey,
Hey sweetie, first of all just know I love you with every ounce of my being. I hope this letter reaches you and I hope you can understand it, although you may not understand why. I dont even know how to begin. I suffer from the disease of addiction and have well before you came into my life. I knew having you while I was still lost in my addiction was a **bad** idea, but I had hopes that having you would get me straight, motivate and push me in the right direction. But it wasn't. It's not your fault, none of this is. Your dad just was not open and willing to try something new. Although I knew what was at stake I still let my disease run my life. During my addiction drugs were always my top priority, I would do anything and everything to stay loaded. Drugs kept me from you in your earlier years and they are going to continue to keep me away. You probably don't remember this but I didn't officially meet you until you were two years old. I had gotten sober around your second birthday. I did a residential program and made a promise to myself that when I was done there I was going to meet you and you were going to keep me sober. I remember the first time we met, you were on your grandma's iPad watching stuff on YouTube. Way too busy to notice me, which was fine. I was overjoyed with just being a stranger to you. But as time went on our bond formed. I remember one time I brought my mom to come meet you for her first time and you surprised the both of us when you called me daddy. Just then my heart dropped into my stomach and I finally felt important to you. Shortly thereafter my addiction came calling and I had to go. You were not enough to keep me sober, again, not your fault. Once i relapsed i was using until i went to prison at the end of 2017. I'm sorry for leaving you Audrey, it doesn't mean i dont love you. It sucks having one absent parent, it's even worse when both are gone. I can only speak on my behalf but I'm sorry your mom has slipped on her motherly duties. She had you at 19, neither of us were ready. Her  and I were on two different paths and could not come together for you. We both love you so much but we have our own issues. I am so grateful for your grandmother, because of her you are growing up in a safe, loving and nurturing environment. Something I could not give you. My grandmother, your great grandmother has been there as much as possible and loves you unconditionally. Unlike me she will always be there for you no matter what. Anything you ever need just ask her. I'm sorry that its come to this Audrey, but I have to say goodbye. I'm sorry that I wasn't there then, and won't be when you need me most. I'm sorry that I never made it to any of your birthday parties. I'm sorry I missed your first day of kindergarten. I'm sorry I won't be able to teach you how to drive. I'm sorry I won't be able to buy you your first car. I'm sorry I won't be there for any of your graduations. I'm sorry I won't be there to see you off to college. I'm sorry I won't be able to warn you about boys. I'm sorry I won't be there the first time your heart gets broken. I'm sorry I won't be at your wedding. I'm sorry I won't be there for you and your kids when you have them. I'm sorry I wont be there when you need advice on parenting. I'm sorry I failed you as a father. I'm sorry you're going to go your whole life with out me. Audrey I cherish and am going to continue to carry all the memories I have of you. You were the greatest thing to ever happen to me, I just wish I could of got my act together in time to be there for you. You're so smart Audrey, you can do anything you set your mind on. Set goals and work hard to achieve them. I had goals but I didn't put the work in to reach them. This is my goodbye and goodbye is forever. Love your life

I ask that you please refrain from posting on this thread and I vow to remain neutral.

ACTUAL UPDATE: 
After reaching out to some folks from my undergrad who know more resources in the area, I was able to find a couple places that can work with and accommodate the multi layered “not your average” situation 

To the individual who told me to attack insurance first, thank you. Cause that’s absolutely the first step to take.

I have since spoke with my brother and what I, we, (him and I) need help in is more on logistics.

He wants to seek treatment in the state I’m in (and some of his other family is in) bc he realizes that’s going to be his way of gaining natural support.

Does anyone have experience in getting residential treatment WITHOUT insurance and little to no private funds? Has anyone seeked recovery in another state and found you wanted to plant your roots there?

Am I making any sense? I’m trying to address one issue first before moving to the next. 

Logistics and finance is the present issue (as of 11pm on 6/20/2020)

My brother needs rehab for alcohol.
He does not live in the same state as I.
He without a doubt has an undiagnosed mental illness that is certainly a barrier to him being successful with treatment.
He also has a temporary disability due to health complications and alcohol abuse. He can only get around with a wheelchair or a walker. He has the potential to walk again, work again, etc but currently all of the issues at hand are stacking up and I don’t know what avenue to take.
He is also part of the LGBT community so he needs support there as well.
He’s willing to go anywhere (so he says)
But how do you address someone who doesn’t know they have a mental illness, is in active addiction, can’t walk without physical therapy, and quite frankly might not have insurance to fund this.

He will be 38 this year and if he doesn’t get into treatment soon, he will without a doubt not see 39.

Any advice is so so appreciated.",12

Long story short, I somehow managed to get off that shit but since then (about 8 years ago)  I've been getting by as an alcoholic. By getting by, of course I mean the occasional run in with cops, doing drugs with random folks when the opportunity came up, horrible moments with friends and more recently a broken ankle that I wasn't able to even explain to myself. Somehow though, I still convinced myself I was getting by, because I could hold down a job and function enough. That started to change with COVID. I almost lost my job, cause turns out, haha big surprise, when given extra freedom, all I want to do is drink.

Is it normal for me to still feel broken inside?,"At the end of 2018 and the first half of 2019, my best friend had been prescribed Xanax for his seizures and anxiety. I don't know how but eventually he began to abuse his prescription and mixed it with constant consumption of alcohol as well.

I spent a lot of that winter trying to help him taper off while dealing with his memory lapses, further seizures, and many fights and hurtful words. I told myself that he wasn't himself so I shouldn't take the hurtfulness of his actions to heart.

He developed a toxic mindset and refused to listen to me about my concerns for a very long time. I still have terrible flashbacks to those memories, the fear that he would die, and that I couldn't help him. We live in a foreign country and outside support was non-existent at the time. I remember a time where he woke up in the middle of the night and didnt recognize me or knew who he was himself. He would eat Xanax like candy and chase it with shots.

Due to complicated reasons, I was not able to confide in anyone about what happened and he wouldn't help me either for a long time even after he got better.

Eventually, he got past it. It's been a year now and the memories still hurt me a lot, even though he has made changes to be better, even though he had since apologized to me for all of it.

Is it normal to still be hurting from what happened back then? Am I overreacting by still being upset from those events? Am I allowed to still be hurt or should I just get over it?",14

Any suggestions, advice, support, or just talking to someone would help a lot...","I want to make this long story short bc it could go on for days... My very first encounter with prescription pain medication was about 6 years ago (I was 23 at the time) when my mom got diagnosed with chronic pain... At the beginning it was hard for her to get prescribed pain meds, so we knew a friend of a friend that had a whole bunch of 5mg OxyCodone bottles stocked up bc he wouldn’t take them... I snagged a few bottles and that’s pretty much where it all started for me...

Once my mom got on her pain management program and was able to get her own meds, she didn’t need to deal with that Oxy dude anymore. However, what she didn’t know is that I continued to keep in contact with him... For a good 4 1/2 years this guy gave me his monthly prescriptions of 120, 5mg OxyCodone for dirt cheap bc I’m young and cute and it probably tickled his ego that I would text him so often practically begging to know when the next time would be that I’d see him 🙄

Of course over time my tolerance had built and I took more and more and would start to run out quick. I’d end having a week of WD’s waiting for his next refill... Eventually I got better with my self-control &amp; was able to manage limiting my daily amounts so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the WD’s while I impatiently awaited his monthly visits to me...

During this whole time, my mom was going thru her pain management program, trying to find the right doctors, ppl who would prescribe her amounts that she could deal with... and eventually she got to a point where she had the loadsssss of 40mg, OxyContin Extended Release &amp; 15mg OxyCodone Instant Release stocked up...

I had convinced her that I could sell those for her to make some money since she wasn’t working at the time and had no income. 
For the last 2.5 years I’ve been selling AND taking my moms pain meds, but now her “stock pile” is gone of course and she’s been “sparing” me a few pills a month to “sell”...
This month she finally told me her pain mgmt dr. Cut her meds back by a lot and she won’t be able to spare me any pills to sell anymore.

At this point the dude I used to get his monthly scripts from had ghosted me about a year ago now... I’ve about drained my bank account buying my own moms pills bc she thinks I’ve been “selling them”, and bc what I would get from her is such high doses of OxyCodone and OxyContin, and the shit I find on the streets doesn’t do shit for me except drain my bank account even more and got me looking desperate calling anyone and everyone I know trying to find more pills.

With how scarce its getting to find them, the costs, and the crazy ass WD’s I’ve been dealing with lately (longest I lasted cold turkey bc I couldn’t find anything was 4 days)...I finally got the courage to call a MAT facility to seek help.

They offer Suboxone and Methadone treatment. And I’m waiting for them to call me back to see if my medical covers their program... but I just don’t know how I feel about replacing one addiction with another? 

I guess I’m just looking for any positive recovery stories or recommendations or just simply support? I’m at this turning point in my life I’m 29, I’m at a great place in my career but I’m starting to fail bc these drugs have taken over my entire life.

I soon moved away and to THE BIG CITY and decided to pursue comedy and film.  

Uphill battles are where I strive and I wanted to explore those battles with this video. When I was being a regular user ( When I would party and not realize I had a problem) I would consume 1500$ of cocaine every weekend than in recovery when I would relapse I would consume 3000$. It got worse cause in recovery when I would use I felt such guilt and displeasure it brought me to a really bad place and I wanted to stay in that place as long as I could cause I felt so bad and I knew when I came down I would have to deal with the consequences.  I added that part so no one was confused on why it would get worse in recovery. So I made this video exactly when I wanted to get high. 

I was sitting in my room and I was doing my ""COKE MATH"" and I thought about how I am doing these crazy equations in my head so that I know how much drugs I need to consume for exactly 1 day. And I thought it would be interesting to make a video about it.   So i grabbed the camera and recorded myself doing the math simplifying 1 8 ball into actual time I would spend on it and made a neat video. 

It really helped and it was a nice way to be creative so maybe if anyone needs to write or record how your brain process your addiction and watch it .It's like giving yourself a little review only you will understand.

2 years ago today was the last time I smoked meth and later came home from Atlanta and checked myself into rehab. No one knew where I was or how I got to Atlanta from Baltimore. 
I celebrated a little early the other day (telling friends and some family) but I didn’t realize today was my actual sobriety date for meth. I’m also clean from crack, dope, and coke as well. If you’re struggling you can do this. 

I’m 22 right now. don’t let your last stop be jails, rehabs, or halfway houses. I’ll always be different from the drug use. I’ll never be that old person I was before my friends died and I lost my sanity. I work on myself and I identify my flaws and weaknesses. I’m not perfect I still make mistakes I still put myself in bad situations with bad people. 

I wish to never experience the winters in hell I went through but it’s making me the person I am today.",24

2020-06-16 12:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ha6sk0/alcoholicaddict_with_a_few_years_cleansober/,Alcoholic/Addict with a few years clean/sober,"Just wanted to check in since I’m new to this sub. This is an especially difficult time for those who are new to sober living, so just hang in there and don’t give up! Try to find some online meetings if you can (there’s tons of zoom meetings every day) and there are even some meetings in person that are practicing social distancing.

My story is pretty common among addicts/alcoholics- started smoking weed/drinking in high school. Lots of parties and social drinking/ drug use. I always seemed to be the one who would overshoot the mark- often I would drink/take too much or find that one or two was just never enough. There was a lot of experimentation with different combinations of drugs/alcohol but mostly stuck to weed during the day and alcohol at night.

Then I tried coke and that was a game changer- it felt amazing and allowed me to drink WAY more without throwing up or passing out. That was happening a lot so I thought that I had just unlocked the secret to happiness. What I actually found was the combination that would bring me to my knees quicker than ever.

Within a year I was drinking and using every day. It was pretty fun for a while- not going to lie, but I started having so many problems. I would always justify and lie about what I was doing with friends and family. It was like I had two different faces- the public face that I would put on for the girlfriend/family/work which was outgoing, charismatic, successful, and the private face which was consumed with fear, self-doubt, self-pity, selfishness, discomfort, anxiety, and the feeling of impending doom.

Eventually the girlfriend would figure out what I was up to and leave, which was painful so I just poured more drugs/alcohol into that ever deepening pit of despair where my soul once lived. I was terrified of actually feeling my feelings and would much prefer to just be numb.

Then I would put on my happy face and try again. Get another girlfriend, and lie until she eventually left. Rinse and repeat for the next 6 years.

At this point I was starting to get physically sick and unable to function without being loaded. I couldn’t consistently show up to work/school and one by one started losing all the things until I had to move back in with my mom at the age of 27. 

This was where I hit my bottom, alone, drinking and using in my bedroom so my mom wouldn’t catch me (even though she knew- I’m pretty sure everyone knew at that point). I would wake up and not know whether the sun was going down or coming up. Everything hurt, and the drugs/alcohol just stopped working. I was at the jumping off point where I didn’t want to live and I didn’t want to die. 

I had been through rehab a couple times at this point but it was always to get someone off my back, either my girlfriend or my mom. I never actually wanted to get clean/sober and every time I would dry out for a couple months I would just pick back up where I left off. It always got worse, never better.

I thought rehab didn’t work so why bother. But now I was really desperate- I really wanted to stop but I couldn’t. I would wake up and say, “Today we are not going to drink!” And by noon I would be shaking and sweating so bad I would just give up and get loaded.

I finally broke down and told my mom everything and for the first time asked for help and really meant it. I knew that I couldn’t do this on my own- I had been trying to quit for weeks on my own and couldn’t last a single day. I checked back into the outpatient rehab center they had near my house and started going to AA/NA meetings. 

I found that with the support of other addicts and alcoholics I could stay sober for a day, then two days. Before you know it I had a week clean/sober! I felt like drinking every single day that first month and if I didn’t have my ass in a meeting or pick up my phone and call my sponsor I definitely would have drank. 

My sponsor took me through the twelve steps of AA and little by little I started to experience the miracle of recovery. Only by admitting complete defeat was I able to have the spiritual experience that it talks about at the end of the book, “Alcoholics Anonymous” I was finally free!

Some of the things that I learned along the path of recovery- 

Once you are an alcoholic or an addict, it is for life. I can never again safely take another drink without setting in motion the terrible sequence of events which will lead to my death.

As an addict/alcoholic I am physically different than my fellow man who can drink with impunity. I have a mental obsession and a physical allergy to alcohol/drugs which cause me to react differently than my fellows. When I take a drink, the allergy kicks in which renders me unable to control the amount that I drink/use. When I stop the mental obsession kicks in leading me back to the first drink which sets the whole thing in motion once again. 

To this day, there is no cure- all I have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of my spiritual condition. If I continue to do the things that my sponsor showed me early in recovery- go to meetings, pick up the phone, be of service to others, make amends quickly, take inventory regularly, pray/meditate regularly, and be willing to help out the fellow alcoholic/addict who is still suffering- then I have a pretty good shot at staying sober today.

Today I am living the life that I always dreamed of- I can look at myself in the mirror and smile. I have a great relationship with my family, and my girlfriend (who is also in recovery). My friends are mostly other sober members of AA and we do lots of fun things together- camp outs, potlucks, birthday parties, dances, golfing, and even SCUBA diving! 

I hope this helped somebody who is out there struggling. There are many resources available to you if you need help. My outpatient rehab was covered by my medical insurance and AA/NA is free to those who want it. 

TL, DR: My life was a train wreck, now it’s not! Sobriety date: January 25, 2015",57

**Intro:** My sister has been using (mainly heroin) for the past 9-12 months which started after meeting/connecting with an addict who was a rebound relationship following the conclusion of a painful divorce. She has never had supportive men in her life and has left one destructive relationship to the next. Prior to all of this she has never had (to our knowledge) past experiences with drug use and always said she never understood how/why people used.

**The Discovery:** She lives/lived in Florida and our family first found out about the drug use in October after my mother went down to visit based on suspicions of things feeling ""off"" when they communicated. We then discovered she dug herself into a deep hole of debt and was borrowing/begging/stealing to keep her ""high"" alive. She agreed to come up to North Carolina where we have family living to help her detox and take steps towards recovery. Through her ""detox"" and ""recovery"" while she was back in North Carolina with us she claimed the entire time that she didn't have a problem with drugs and ""only did them occasionally as a social activity with friends"" and insisted that she was done using. She started seeing a therapist while she was here and seemed to be making forward progress with ""normalizing"" but I could tell she had no intentions of staying here. She would frequently mention missing Florida and ""the feel of home"" it gave her.

**The Relapse:** A job opportunity from a past work relationship was presented to her and that gave her the out to leave and head back down to Florida. Against all of our advice she left and began work down there. Communication with her while she was there always felt superficial but she would tell us how good she was doing and how well everything was going. Flash forward a few months later she came back to visit us for Memorial Day but didn't quite seem herself. We learned her addict boyfriend had gotten arrested ""borrowing her car"" without telling her and she found out through friends he was going around telling others the only reason he was with her was that she was his ""cash cow"". She was angry, disgusted, and was adamant that she has ""no interest in being with someone like that"". We were cautiously optimistic but two weeks later my mother got a call from her at 1am to pick her up in Florida because she had been to the hospital from painful hand and foot pain after using. She was hysterically crying and told us she had been using since she went back down and that she didn't want to feel like this anymore, didn't want to have to worry about how she was going to get her next meal, or find a place to sleep. We all got in the car, went down to Florida, and took her back to North Carolina to stay with my mom (who is also a nurse).

**Today:** We had hoped this past experience was her ""bottom"" but after a recent visit I'm not sure it was. She talks about her experiences living with drug dealers, being homeless, using, the ins and outs of drug use, etc. freely. All the music she listens to is about using or drugs and she's now talking to the addict boyfriend again after swearing him off a few weeks ago.

She has been back with us for just over a week and I don't know what to do to get her the help she needs. Our family doesn't have much money and she currently doesn't have insurance. My father thinks inpatient rehab, my mother thinks we cant afford it, and I'm in the middle trying to broker communications. We have no experience dealing with this and the last thing I want is for us to make decisions that we think are best for her without knowing what that truly is.

If nothing is done I am sure she will try to leave again and use.

**Summary**: The above only covers the surface of everything thats been going on. If you have any advice or can share experiences I would be eternally grateful. I'm scared but hopeful if the right steps are taken can help her get to a point of recovery.",3

I'm scared of benzos due to prior use, so not going to use long term. However I've been drinking like 10+ drinks per day and I'm done with the shakes and whatnot. Got three 2mg bars, and I'm sensitive so it might work.

Took one drink upon waking for standard shakes, waited an hour until it cleared system then took 0.5mg of Xanax. Worked for a couple hours but then shakes again when I was making lunch, so I took another 0.5mg and promptly passed out for 5 hours. So obviously I should space them out more, but please send any guides/resources on doing this yourself! I successfully tapered by myself in 2018 so I know I can do it.

I even tried making a schedule that moderated all the behaviors but didn’t even think to check it the next day.

I’ve been thinking a lot more about what’s actually happening in my brain because it helps with understanding how changing behaviors can feel so wrong because my brain hasn’t had time to rewire yet. Is this what it is? Is my brain just completely wired for compulsion and addiction? Does it take longer to break the habit if it’s been going on since childhood?

It can be a good thing if it’s turned towards something productive, like a project. But it also destroys the fun in everything I like and it’s stupid. I know this is probably adhd behavior  but I also can’t take stimulants and am just happier without having to worry about any sort of substance.",41

TL:Dr; My Aunt is addicted to valium and opiates, and is refusing point blank to do anything about it at the cost of her physical and mental health. I'm going through to her in a few days to try talk with her and would like some advice on how to approach her. 

I'm in Scotland and my aunt has been living in a different city for most of my life, she was on heroin for a long time before switching to methadone (yay, NHS). Shes been having epileptic seizures from what we can tell and is mixing valium and other powerful pain killers. She has had legit problems with her spine before, so she took to self medicating to try sort that out. 

A few weeks ago, she was rushed to hospital after being unresponsive, and has been kept in since. She's been uncooperative with the drs and is running my mum ragged getting things outside the house brought in for her. She's had MRIs and tests done and it has came back with nothing out of the ordinary. My mum has been helping her clean up her flat and throwing away (to a chemist) the medication she has been abusing. She would not get rid of a cube of hash (understandable, I've not got much of a problem with that), but what is worrying us is a large pill bottle full of valium. In hospital they have lowered her dosage of methadone and painkillers

 She is now looking to be released from hospital (surprisingly after her medication was lowered) and I'm worried that she will go straight back to self medicating or worse, ODing on something she can get from the streets. 

I'm a youth worker/teaching assistant and used to working with young people that society has let slip through, but it's a whole other thing when it comes to family.

I'm at a loose end and would like to have some outside experience on this. 

Thank you for reading through, and stay strong.

I somewhat feel congested even tho when I blow my nose nothing comes out. I've had white boogers for months and they have pretty much went away and sometimes I'll blow my nose and blood comes out.

I've know since I was around 10 or 11 that my dad uses coke. I'm now 21. My brothers first birthday he was coming down so hard that he didn't leave his bed. Over the years though, things have become worse, a lot worse. He isn't a young man anymore yet he keeps shoveling that shit into his nose like he's 25. I'm scared, genuinely scared that he is going to kill himself. 

Well anyway I put my foot down and made him tell my mum what was going on. She was and still is heartbroken. Mostly for the reason that I have been whiteness to his usage many times and she never suspected a thing. 

He admitted to using a gram a night for the past three weeks. For a man in debt that doesn't sound cheap. 

He's promised me before that he would change. When I was 14 and found a bag of coke he promised me then. When I was 16 and watched him do a line he promised me then. When I was 18 being asked if I wanted to try it... I made him promise me then. 

This time, no promise. Not even a care in the world. Just his own guilt. I want him to see why he needs to be clean, why he needs to stop and live a normal life. I can't believe he's been using it for 10 years now, I've lied for him too many times. Now I need to give him the truth. He's going to die, he's going to destroy his family and he will not live to watch his two baby grandchildren grown up if he doesn't stop. 

My mum called for a divorce. Believing he can't hide that for so long and not have other secrets. 

I told him to get help (he already has CBT) from a therapist and to get help with his addiction but he doesn't see the issue. He thinks he can just stop. I don't get it... Why can't he see what he is doing? 

How can I help him, what can I say or do to make it easier. 

I'm so angry but I'm not selfish enough to make him deal with this alone. What can I do?",2

But I also don’t feel like an alcoholic,"Okay so basically. It’s in the title. Since quarantine started I’ve really really started to have a lot of self reflection on my relationship with social drinking. 

I feel like I either have one drink or I drink until I’m totally drunk. Thinking back, most of the time there has been no in-between. And the last few times I’ve been drunk I did some things and said some things I really regret. Totally black out at a bachelorette party and became “that drunk girl” and then the next time got into a huge blow out fight with my parents. 

Most of the time however, When I’m drunk, im the life of the party and don’t really have any negative repercussions except a hangover the next day. Usually people text me the next day saying how much fun they had with me or things like that. 

The issue here is that I don’t go out to drink often. So my husband for example feels like it’s just a rare occurrence since I usually dont “act out” when I’m drunk. I also have no problem having a glass of wine or two at home and not getting out of control. So to him he sees me drinking all the time and feels like I’m over analyzing my social drinking based on two bad days. 

Last night my cousin came over and he and my husband were drinking. My cousin asked why I wasn’t drinking with them and I told him why. I basically said “I feel like when I drink socially I’m either sober or drunk. Like I can’t control how much I drink once I start” my cousin didn’t make a big deal of it and never asked me to have a beer or anything the rest of the night. When we were going to bed though, my husband said he felt like I was making myself look really bad and sound like I had a serious drinking problem that I don’t have. 

But I feel like it IS a serious problem that since I started drinking at 15 that Ive never learned how to regulate. I always show up ready to party and get fucked up. And I feel like that’s a problem even if I’m only going out once a month. 

Where do I go from here? How do I address the severity of the situation without making myself “sound like an alcoholic”?????

TLDR- I feel like I might have a problem with social drinking and getting too drunk. Where do I go from here?",25

I built so much goddamn confidence When I was sober. Pride too. I liked who I was and where I was going. I didnt have to hide anything from anyone or experience that shame of being fucked up around a person you dont want to see you fucked up. 

Being sober forced me to fill my time with ofher stuff. I did new things. I went back to school. I got really into clothes. I actually started to connect with people. I felt genuine lasting happiness for the first time ever. I honestly didn’t even think that was possible for me. I even started to forgive myself and show myself the empathy that I show others. The confidence just kept building and building. I got my personality back. I was funny. I stopped giving a shit about being tough or if the wrong people thought I was cool. I was like a freight train of positivity. I didn’t think I could succeed, I knew I was going to.

And now it’s fucked. I won’t say it’s all been undone but I feel so shook. Just going back to this after actually having that feeling of pride. It was so hard to do all that but it was so beautiful at times. I can’t believe I did it. All I had to do was throw that fucking bag out the window, drive to an NA meeting and finally speak up about my story. Listen to the people who said to get a sponsor. Stop character assassinating. Actually let them in. Go through the 12 steps and do the goddamn work.

But no I convinced myself that they’d never understand because I’m not a tough guy like them. Because I’m a nerd and a goofball who had barely touched any substances beyond pot and alcohol before age 26. I thought they’d judge me for letting an NPD girl abuse me. I thought they’d label me when I said I went psychotic after she humiliated me and discArded me. I thought the schizophrenia diagnosis I picked up would make them wonder if I was going to stab them or burn the church down, even though I was in remission and have never been violent.

So I convinced myself I just had to work harder. That I needed to add cardio to my routine. That I needed to find a girl who understood me, then I could finally open up. But it was a crock of shit. 

And now here I am, having barely slept in a week and crashing from the adderall, fighting the urge to take another one because I know I’m gonna stay up all night if I do. And this is actually an improvement from a few weeks ago when I was shooting .5 to a gram of fentanyl a day on top of it and taking xanax at night to get to sleep. Which btw created the worst withdrawals I have ever had at the ER and literally caused me to shit my pants and then projectile vomit in rapid succession. That’s gonna be a great memory to add to my list of stuff I need to stop being ashamed of. 

So yea, rant over, but can someone please tell me a story of relapse and recovery because I’m having a really hard time thinking positively. I can go to rehab tomorrow, but it would involve flushing a fairly big supply of adderall and part of me can’t bear the thought of that. Convince me to just fucking go. Please. I’ve come so far. I fucking survived overdose hypoxia so bad that it took me 30 minutes to even be able to comprehend what was happening or that I was a human on planet earth honestly. It’s a miracle I’m not dead or brain damaged. I’ve managed to come back to sanity after being acutely psychotic for over 5 years.  4 years ago I was drunk as fuck, ranting at people on the streets about how I was jesus christ. I’ve been a complete abusive prick and have managed to basically not even say anything mean to anyone in a year. The odds of me getting to the point I was at last year were so low. But I tried so fucking hard and I did it. I can feel the delusions trying to get back in. I’m all too aware that my vivitrol wears off in 3 weeks. I know where this is going if I don’t stop and I can’t let it end like that. Tell me you relapsed and now you’re happy. Convince me to go. Please.",17

I found myself in the back seat of a cop car for the first time in the 20 years I used. I was given an ultimatum 3 years in prison or 35 days in rehab and 4 drug classes. Pretty easy choice till day 4. Cuz at the end I had a huge heroin, crack, and meth habit. I needed mass quantities of all 3 just so I could almost b human. By day 4 I was sick really sick. I had been listening to the others in this rehab and most of them were living under a bridge last week. I thought yeah I’m a drug addict but I own my house out rite, I have a really nice truck, and a condo on an island facing the Gulf of Mexico. I’m not like them. It took another week to realize that I still wanted to die and no amount of stuff was going to change that. I was exactly like those homeless people. I had that house I didn’t sleep in. I had a fridge full of food I didn’t eat. I had a shower I hardly used. That truck I was what I napped in occasionally. Pretty much homeless. That’s not counting the wife I had at home that was just confused. She was pretty positive I had another woman and at least 1 kid. While in that treatment facility I was shown a possible way out. Cuz junkies like me we die and I thought death was the only way to peace. I left thinking I can do this the only problem is I’m my own worst enemy. I went to meetings made some friends and learned the most important part of meetings was I had to go to places where it was a great thing not to use. All that went down 6 years ago I haven’t picked up since. I still hang out with people that think it’s cool to not get high. After a year or so I started being a father to my son. A husband to my wife. I work at a job I make half what I made while using but I work 14 days a month. We go kayaking, camping, and we have dinner almost every night. I hadn’t had any form of happiness in my life in more than a decade. I am happy more than not but I’m definitely grateful I’m terrible at killing my self.",10

Things got really out of hand in April and I neglected everything. I ended up being about 60 days late on a payment for my Amazon Credit card. The total amount was about $150 but that was due to something I bought in April, the majority of the time I was late, the amount was less than $30. I read that being 30 or 60 days late was significantly better than being 90 days late, so I went back and made sure I was less than 90 days late. It’s stupid because I could’ve easily made the payment but I just wasn’t paying attention. The whole thing is a bit of a blur.

I’m sober again now and in damage control mode. I read that you can try to explain to your creditor why you were late and that they might remove the late mark, especially if it’s a first offense. I was very vigilant about making payments when I was sober and have no other late payments on my credit report. I got that account, and all my other accounts, up to date (none of them were overdue). I’m gonna send a message asking for forgiveness but I’m not sure if I should directly say it was because of a relapse or if I should just hint at a general crisis and hope the covid-19 forgiveness works in my favor too (I take full responsibility for my actions but covid definitely played a part in the full on relapse). 

I also have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, though it’s fairly under control and I think you could almost say it’s in remission since I’m delusion free about 50% of the time, and I believe I’ll be completely delusion free in the next few years. I’m not sure if both of these things will work in my favor or if it will cause them to be harsher on me and maybe even put a note on my account. 

The late payment literally dropped my credit score by 100 points on both equifax and transunion. I was points away from having an excellent rating on both and now I’m at fair. I had no idea one missed payment could be so damaging, but apparently 100 points off a good credit score for a missed payment over $100 is pretty standard. And I’ve also heard that the mark will stay on my record for 7 years, so obviously getting it removed would be great. Does anyone have any experience with this or advice on how I should word the message? 

I could just say I got severely depressed because of covid, and neglected everything. I’ve been severely depressed for months at a time in the past and could even provide documentation of a Major Depressive diagnosis if they needed it. I’m thinking this might go over a lot better than dropping the bomb of having Issues with addiction and psychosis.",1

Drugs control my life

So don't try to convince me that

I can be sober

Because at the end of the day

I can't do this

And I'm not going to lie to myself by saying

I will prosper and succeed

So I will remind myself

That I am a selfish terrible person

And nothing you tell me will make me believe

I deserve a good life

Because no matter what

I will always be addicted

And I wonder if

Things will get better

Because when I look in the mirror, I will always think

Can I recover?

I'm almost 24 years old and my problem started when I was around 17 but got to a dangerous point (drinking liquor for over 24 hours straight, getting into reckless situations, ruining relationships, polysubstance use, etc.) around May of 2019. I had gone thru a break-up with a partner whom I had been with for almost 4 years and although I had been a drinker before that's when my drinking really became a problem. I moved to a new city completely alone (no roommates or anything) which of course didn't help since all I really knew what to do was drink, and when I'd meet new people we'd always go to the bars in town. But on October 16th, I hit my lowest point. I overdosed (from a combination of alcohol & pills) and even though I wasn't trying to kill myself they deemed it as suicidal ideation. Passive suicide, I suppose. I even drank after that incident, which really shows you how evil addiction can be. Passed out on the sidewalk at 9:30 AM on a Wednesday to taking shots of vodka (my ex-drink of choice) within the next week.

On February 23rd, 2020 I had had enough. I woke up shaking from the night before, reset my counter back down to 0 days, and decided I was done.

100 days later and I have yet to reset it :)",106
