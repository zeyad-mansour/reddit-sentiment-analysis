What's up anxiety, paranoia and crushing dread and fear.","Ended up with some white in my pocket last weekend and all this week I've been habitually doing bumps and though I can feel my system is a bit practiced and strengthened for fighting addictive tendencies, I obviously still am having trouble seeing the reasons for sobriety if I can just sneak in cocaine over the course of a week and be all panicked and confused when I run out. 

I only did maybe a gram lol. But I can still feel myself going back to that spiral. The shaky hands, racing thoughts, tension, wide eyed and sore jaw existence are appearing on my horizon. Having shameful thoughts of my family and where my life is going and how bad I am at taking care of myself. I seem to go from 0-100 with health, forcing myself to be ludicrously healthy for a few days then falling out of that routine into sub-par habits, but when liquor and hard drugs come into the equation I lose sight of everything I believed in as a sober person. You see people take hard drugs as if their parents encouraged them or that they never feel addicted. Or just not concerned about it. I don't know. Drug addicts fascinate me. 

Hope someone out there can drop an anchor for me and knock some sense into me. I'm really tempted to go get some more stuff and just keep having a little personal party in my apartment for the rest of the night. What I'd end up doing if I could forget that idea is probably so wholesome and productive for my life I can hardly bear to think it. Sometimes it's just easier to keep leaning in the direction you're spinning. But lo I must learn to master my own fate.",23,0
4,2020-01-30 15:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ewbemu/i_want_to_talk_about_music_in_recovery/,I want to talk about music in recovery,"Like lots of addicts, I really struggle with feelings and spent much of my using trying to avoid them, both positive and negative. In the first few weeks back after a relapse I'm desperately trying to cope with the sudden impact of confronting them again and one way that works so well for me is music. Rather than trying to suppress emotion, music allows me to channel it, to process it and release it in a way that doesn't overwhelm me.

&#x200B;

Many of us will understand the old adage that 'the opposite of addiction is connection'. Sometimes I find myself sharing a song or specific lyric that perfectly captures an aspect of my recovery and knowing that rarely will they be in a place and time that‚Äôs conducive to them really appreciating it at the level you hoped when you shared it.

&#x200B;

But despite that, there have been enough times in my life where I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of a recommendation and things really have just clicked. The stars align and they caught me in a quiet moment, giving it my full attention and it‚Äôs ended up blowing me away and becoming incredibly close to my heart. There are songs people in recovery have suggested to me that I have listened to on repeat. They've made me cry, they've given me hope, they've helped me deal with anger and frustration. 

&#x200B;

The belief that just once in a while, songs I share myself might have that effect on someone is enough to keep me doing it myself. The belief that every now and then, two addicts share something meaningful to them that makes them both feel a little less alone in the fight. 

&#x200B;

If this has struck a chord with anyone, please go ahead and share a song and any lyrics in particular that have helped you at any stage in your recovery, either here or by PM if you prefer. I guarantee that I will listen to every single one with attention and sincerity. Stay strong beautiful people.",7,0

My triggers are the following 

1 money is my hugest it lead to my relapse because I had left my job that has a steady salary to have a job with an amazing healthcare agency that anyway ruined my financially. And the fights it caused

2. Anything dealing with my ex boyfriend when I get emotional.  Cause I knew I thought I was done. And would be married by now. 

3. Family having kids and marriage and on track and me 34 at home alcoholic in AA trying her best. Working at a great job but not paying the bills.

Anyway we really did like each other. We had wanted to go out as friends and that was it. Just hang out but as soon as we did we knew it would turn. So we tried. So I wanted to keep it professional with him. I had to email him for work I am a social worker working w seniors and he is a pharmacist. I was gonna be having to utilize his pharmacy for work. So I sent him a very professional email. And expected him to pass it on to his xo worked. Nope he didn‚Äôt he was professional and then kept it professional. As soon as we talked we picked up right where we left off. And slowly over the summer we begin to see each other more and slowly but surely one night we are sitting in his car having some coffee and it was one of those moments you go oh shit..... and we had tried to hold back and we end up making out.... well anyway he‚Äôs getting divorced we are slowly beginning to date.",0,0

My partner recently relapsed on heroin - he's been using again for a few weeks after a nearly 8 year stretch of sobriety.

He recently lost his job, which triggered the relapse. He is new in town and doesn't have a support system here. He has a group of friends out of state that he's very close to - I did reach out to them to let them know so that they could reach out to him as well. His parents are not supportive and I don't want to contact them.

He has mostly stopped responding to my texts and when I have gone over to his house, he is high and not lucid. He's obviously not ready to stop but he has expressed that doesn't want to keep doing this either. I have offered my support by saying that I am happy to sit with him during a detox, bring him to MAT, go to a meeting, etc. I obviously can't force him to do anything.

I told him I didn't think it was healthy for us to spend time together when he's actively using but I want to be a part of his life and I don't want to lose him. I have texted him every day since I found out just letting him know that I'm here and he's not alone and when he's ready to be done, I'll be there. I am afraid he is going to die.

So now I'm fully aware what I am at risk of losing and I'm back to literally one day and at times one hour at a time trying not to go full panic attack. 

So I set up an appointment to see a therapist. Maybe I need some career redirection, or stress management techniques, or just someone to dump my bullshit on who I dont have a personal relationship with. I set up an appointment with the counseling center at my college.

When I arrive for my appointment I wait 30 minutes after my appointment time to actually see the random therapist that was assigned to me. While I was waiting in that chair I nearly lost it, feelings of hopelessness, anger and exhaustion overwhelming me.

Fast forward. The therapist I ended up spending 30 minutes with has 30 years in recovery (of fucking course he does) he suggests meetings. So I went to a meeting tonight. What are the odds of that?

Currently living in a sober house on long island NY. I have a question or possibly just asking for some advice on this current matter. This is the first sober house I have been to that is actually really clean, there is few people (3 not counting me in a 8 person house), and for the most past everyone seems like they are doing the right thing, working, going to meetings etc. I have been here for about a month, and I notice this sober house differs from others in that they have a rule that you MUST leave from 9am to 4pm monday-friday. This rule is strictly enforced, regardless if its a holiday, if your're sick, have no where to go etc. I want to know is this legal? Someone told me that receives DSS (welfare) that if DSS pays for you to stay somewhere they can fine or make the manger stop doing it since they are not paying for you to live there part time. The rent is slightly more expensive than other houses, at 650 a month, DSS will cover 471 if you apply. This all being said, what are your experiences with the rule have to be out of the house from 9am-4pm monday through friday? On one hand I feel like it's unreasonable on some days, as here in NY it can be raining/snowing during winter months, and I dont think this is exactly legal if DSS is paying for you to live here. However on the other hand I think this rule can be a good thing, it gets us out of the house, to go to meetings, find jobs and develop a healthy routine. Going to a different sober house could be a bad choice since I've been to several on long island and they have all been infested with bed bugs, dirty conditions, thieves and active addicts. This house kicks people out the same day if they steal or use. There are cameras, and I feel a lot safer at this house than every other house I have been to. So what do you guys think? I've tried finding laws on sober houses on long island but Google just tries to relentlessly sell me something or give me articles about how SLEs are messing up the community.

TL/DR: Is it legal for a sober house landlord to make you leave from 9am-4pm monday through friday?",4,0

5 years ago I went to rehab for oxycodone addiction, I did well and stay away from any kind of substance for 2 and a half years. I started getting a lot bored and decided to try kratom as I read it wasn‚Äôt very addictive and safe. Long story short in 2 years it escalated from 3 doses a week to 4 doses a day. 

Last December I started getting anxiety episodes that have been escalating in intensity, I feel remorseful and I‚Äôm panicking about the smallest things. I‚Äôm an hypochondriac so any little discomfort in my body will trigger an anxiety attack. 

So I decided enough is enough and I‚Äôm tapering the Kratom,I want to be free again. I went from 15 grams per day to five grams per day in a week and haven‚Äôt feel any physical discomfort. The anxiety comes from before the taper so I can‚Äôt blame it to that. I have racing thoughts, start freaking out about everything, nothing logical, nothing real. I was dosing every 5 hours and now I‚Äôm stretching it to every 12-14 hours. 

The thing is I‚Äôm failing at managing my anxiety, I have work and family and I have to be functional all day and this crippling anxiety is making everything so much more difficult. I have been hiding all this shit from my family all this time because specially if my wife finds out I‚Äôm risking losing everything. 

I plan to be totally Kratom free in a couple of months but I need encouragement and tips to manage anxiety. I don‚Äôt know how to stop my mind from freaking out and be calm.  I think I‚Äôm in the right path and in the right mindset to be better and stop consuming Kratom but this doom feeling I have all day and all the guilt is killing me. Please HELP!!!",4,0

my sex life used to be very important to me, but besides using my vibrator and having orgasms for medical-ish purpose (i mean, i don't really get off i only masturbate to calm down mostly), i don't see any appeal to it? not that just it seems hard to ""ease into it"", but i feel like there is nothing to ease into. like, i lost my sexual self or idk. i don't even have wet dreams anymore, they're just fantasies of hugging and sleeping on people, pretty much.

So, this is day 3 of taking care of me :). So far, I've cleaned my bathroom and kitchen from top to bottom and maintained it, I've worked out every day, I'm getting decent sleep, I'm drinking plenty of water, and I've started working on a new habit: instead of thinking ""great, here we go again"" when things go wrong, I force myself to think ""well, I think it'll get better"" and it's made a huge difference.

Today, i stepped out of my comfort zone (I tend to be a bit of a hermit. Not out of fear or anxiety, just out of being an introvert, in general) and I called my grandma up. She's been hoping to get together for lunch since I moved closer to her house and now we've set up a family dinner day on Sunday at her place and she's just tickled pink that I called to make plans.

I'm celebrating 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from alcohol and addictive sex/love behaviors!!! What a fucking miracle that I am alive, want to be alive, and am living sober.

I'm speaking in one of my communities which requests scripts (because of online medium) and I thought I'd share it here for anyone who is interested... It's focused on sex/love but, eh, I think one addictive banana is just a part of the whole bunch. And it's 12-step focused. That's definitely not the only path and it's not even my only path (I also like Buddhist recovery and I've benefited from a generous helping of medical assistance) but, it's the speaker share I wrote, so I'd love to share it with y'all. 

I wish everyone a contented sober day with enough pain to want to change and enough courage to get it done. 

xo

\-

With a lot of joy, a little disbelief, and tremendous gratitude, I celebrated 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from sex and love addiction two days ago. (My sobriety date is January 13, 2016.) I will use the typical 12 step speaker format of what it was like, what happened, and what it‚Äôs like now. I would also like to suggest not only to the newcomer, but also to the old-timer, and everyone in between, to practice open-mindedness in listening today. With any story‚Äîwhether I participated in those behaviors and thoughts or didn‚Äôt‚Äîthere will be things that I can relate with and things that I cannot. It is my responsibility to find the commonality, take what I can for today, and leave the rest to think about later. 

So, about me, and what happened. I had a challenging childhood. I believe two early attachment ruptures contributed to my addiction. I also believe my paternal genetic lineage of mental illness, alcoholism, and completed suicide contributed to my addiction. In short, by the time I was about 7, the slingshot of addiction was loaded and pulled back. So I‚Äôm 7 and I start having ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù. The difference between my ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù and those of my classmates was, I believe, my obsession and the feeling in my chest of wanting to be loved and consumed, even from a young age. I remember once being in the car having broken up with one 7-year-old ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI am so free now! I can do what I want!‚Äù Love addict early on. From 7 to 12 I was having these non-sexual but fantasized-about boyfriends in school and on the bus and on the street. At 12 I discovered my first drug: my asthma inhaler. I also discovered lying. I did not tell my parents why I needed so many inhalers‚Äîpracticing addicts are remarkably selfish and I did not care that they were expensive, but of course I was also a child without much ability to take perspective‚ÄîI just lied that they went off randomly in my backpack. I discovered my first drug and I also started drinking. 

So now I‚Äôm 13 and I have discovered drugs, alcohol, and ‚Äúolder boys‚Äù, which leads me to my first real sexual experience while drinking straight, cheap vodka from water bottles at a public swimming pool with an older boy. I had both the ‚Äúsex‚Äù and ‚Äúlove‚Äù aspects of sex and love addiction, though they would eventually intertwine.  When I was 14 I was in a relationship with a boy whom I fantasized that I would marry and I had sex for the first time‚Äîhe was 4 years my senior. When I was 15 he ‚Äúghosted me‚Äù and I could not understand, I called him obsessively, and this obsessive calling became a hallmark feature of my love addiction. At about age 15 I began running, playing sports, and engaging in bulimia (purging and exercise). Now the trifecta had come to fruition and that addiction slingshot‚Äîwhich had been loaded and pulled back from a young age‚Äîfired, with no undo button. 

So here‚Äôs the addictive trifecta for me: boys, booze, bulimia. I wanted love, I would go out on weekends as a teenager, drink to blackout, which lessened my shame, helped my social anxiety, and allowed me to do things I was otherwise ashamed of. I would wake up, obsess about the guy(s) from before, they would naturally not care, and then I would binge and purge to make myself feel better. I would feel fat, and need a partner to ""love"" me, and tell me I was pretty. I used physical sex as a placeholder for love and being told I‚Äôm pretty. So the next time I could, I would do the cycle again. And this occurred from ages 15 ‚Äì 26. 

Within that timeframe I had many accomplishments: graduating high school with honors, year-long relationships, graduating college summa cum laude, working at a highly prestigious university... I also had many challenges: several medical withdrawals, growing suicidality as part of bipolar disorder, social isolation, constant misery, liver malfunction, incurable STI‚Äôs (two of them), online and camera acting out, unbearable shame, panic attacks every day towards the end. I always felt like I was not enough, or worse, I was too much, annoying, and you were going to leave me, and then I would die. I had no friends. 

By this point I‚Äôm 26 and I am ready to end my life because to continue in this way is futile. I had yet another blackout night culminating in a dehumanizing one-night-stand.Mind you‚ÄîI joined 12 step programs when I was 19 (food related) then 20 (alcohol) then 24 (SLAA) so I was convinced that nothing would work for me. I had already tried sponsors, the steps, I couldn‚Äôt stay sober to save my life (literally), and I was ready to die. I was so low that the only reason I didn‚Äôt enact my plan was it would halt public transportation, and I didn‚Äôt want my death to ruin anyone‚Äôs work commute. I called my psychiatrist because I trusted her, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. On January 13, 2016 she met me at the hospital and had me admitted into a dual-diagnosis unit. That means I am formally diagnosed with addiction and mental illness. Here I was well-medicated and a straight-shooting nurse told me, 

‚ÄúIf you drink, you will die.‚Äù 

I said , ""No no no you don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôve already done AA, I‚Äôve already done all this stuff, it doesn‚Äôt work.""

She replied,  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you do or don‚Äôt do, you just can‚Äôt drink.‚Äù 

So I spent two weeks in this dual-diagnosis unit where I engaged in intrigue with other patients. I decided to stop drinking alcohol through self-will and would fix my life through becoming the perfect worker, the perfect employee,  and would work myself into a better life. Three months later I‚Äôm at my next psychiatric ward, again suicidal. Those three months of intensive professional work and white-knuckle sobriety (alcohol and sex and love) did not fix the fundamental problem which for me I believe is existential, spiritual‚Ä¶ I believe my fundamental problem is NOT that I act out, or that I have the wrong partner, or that I don‚Äôt have a partner, or that the sex isn‚Äôt this way, or that I'm not loved the right way‚Ä¶ I believe my fundamental problem is that I have a god-shaped hole in my chest  that I try to shove full of addictive content, but it will never feel whole and full that way and it will continue consuming and consuming until I give it the right sustenance, which is connection.

So after my second psychiatric ward stay  I realized inwardly what it says in the book Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as the Big Book) that I was ‚Äúunable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it‚Äù (pg. 165). I tried drinking and grabbing at love which landed me in the psych ward. I tried abstaining which landed me in the psych ward. I realized that, as the Big Book says on that same page, the fellowship of the spirit was what would bring me contentment, joy, and meaning. At this point I became deadly serious about surrender. 

The basics of early recovery for me included: no-contact with men (more than 6 months), no relationships (about one year), daily meetings and stepwork. The basic purpose of not talking to men has nothing to do with gender or gender identity. It is that I needed to stop using sex, flirtation, and intrigue as social currency. With women, I had to be a real person to find friendship and camaraderie, and so I developed a community of women. ‚ÄúTime takes time‚Äù is a wonderful motto. I took this time in early recovery to stabilize myself physically, to orient myself as a 12-stepper, and to dig deep into spiritual reflection through stepwork. I have had many wonderful sponsors over time. The worst of my sponsors told me what to do and tried to control me. I now know, this is totally natural for an addict to do,  but it is not the way to a spiritual awakening. The best of my sponsors taught me to take inventory, trust, pray, meditate, and practice selfless service. They put my hand into the god-hand. The best of my sponsors used the Basic Text and Big Book to lift me up towards god, rather than to beat me down into a false humility. Ultimately I did find more and more of what I wanted in recovery: the dignity of choice, open-minded and curious spiritual exploration, freedom from addiction. Most of all I grew over time to authentically love myself. 

I  love this line from our SLAA Basic Text at the end of Chapter 5, The Withdrawal Experience: ‚ÄúAmidst all difficulties and uncertainties, a simple intimacy had come into being for us: we had met ourselves, and found ourselves worthy. We had become ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù to ourselves.‚Äù 

When I was in my addiction, I could not fathom finding myself worthy. I had a whole host of bad names for myself and reasons why I wasn‚Äôt acceptable, which fueled my need to find another person to tell me I was acceptable,  and to pump that god-shaped hole in my heart full of addictive garbage. I wasn‚Äôt worth it, so why would I care?  Yet, today, I am worth it, and I have internalized the love so freely given me in SLAA and other 12-step rooms.  

To the newcomer who wants a suggestion‚ÄîI suggest identifying people with whom you won‚Äôt use sex and social currency, and developing recovery community with them based in honesty and integrity. I suggest working the steps over and over and over again: ‚Äútime takes time‚Äù and these spiritual lessons are not quick to learn. I suggest staying sober, because if you can relate with me...you probably need it to stay alive. On the practical topic of bottom lines, each of us will have our own, so I'll share about just my main one: I don‚Äôt practice infidelity. Infidelity is any behavior which I would not do in front of my partner (from sex to secret messages to long hugs). To my inner addict,  that is a radical, impossible standard! But it is possible in recovery.

Today I am sober from bottom lines in SLAA, alcohol and related substances in AA for 4 years. I have an amazing romantic partner, we are planning a life together. I have a cat who has never seen me drink! :D I am close with my family. I am still reactive, angry, and selfish‚Äîbut not nearly as much and not nearly as frequently. I have faith. I am special, but not unique. What a fun freedom: to love myself without narcissism, to love you without abandoning myself. The freedom of recovery is yours, too, should you choose to pursue it. 

Remember to pause to hear the quiet voice of god. Find your recovery tribe‚Äîstay in the middle of the herd.   Quit filling the god-shaped hole with garbage, one day at a time. You deserve better, I know it even if you're not sure yet. Start filling yourself with faith as you understand faith. You can find it taking the 12 steps. And, for you and for me,  more will be revealed.",18,0

He did clarify that he uses this cocktail on many people in recovery for sedation but does not provide take home doses. That gave me some relief but I'm just scared.

Does anyone here have any experience? If I am put under will I feel high or just asleep? If I'm asleep will my mental symptoms of addiction be triggered/will I be craving again? I'm going to tell my support group and sponsor as well but posted here in hopes of getting an influx of answers.",7,0

I walked through big Art Deco gates, holding his hand, I was wearing a duffle coat like Paddington Bear and my ruby red mittens hung below my cold hands from a string that looped all the way around my back. I could see the heads of giraffes munching leaves and hear the roar of a lion in the distance. We approached the chimp enclosure, languid apes sat slouched over logs picking at each other‚Äôs ball bags. There was a huge sign on the fence that stated very clearly,

‚ÄòDo Not Feed the Animals‚Äô

Dad got a packet of Chewits out of his shirt top pocket, undid the sticky wrapper and chucked one into the cage. He had that cheeky grin across his face,

‚ÄòWatch this kids‚Äô

The ape picked up the sweet and threw it into its mouth. It started chewing, a lot.

Then a sound resonated around the zoo,

‚Äòkaa, kaaaa, kaaaaaaa‚Äô

The monkey was choking. Its eyes protruded from the sockets like the top of hard-boiled eggs. The Chewit lodged in its throat.

‚Äòkaaaaaaahhh‚Äô

Dad‚Äôs expression swiftly changed to total panic,

‚ÄòTime to go kids‚Äô

He had not moved that fast since he won the 400m dash at the Surrey track and field championships in 1953. We were shoved out of the ornate gates, into the car and were on the M4 heading home before morning tea. I hoped the chimp didn't die, I imagined it swallowing the sweet and then finding the packet and finishing them off. Even if he had nearly karked it, it was worth it for those few juicy moments. Animals are funny like that, not thinking things through, repeating the same old stupid behaviours.

Thinking about that story now I realise that I am that chimp! - I have been my whole life - An out of control ape grabbing at a substance that I know will make me sick, pushing through crowds to get to the bar before closing time in order to throw a shot down my neck, choking out the kebab I devoured just hours before. Even if I felt like death afterwards, hungover: knowing alcohol was destroying me, my hand would still be reaching out for another dose, desperately grabbing, wanting more, as soon as the storm had passed.

'Hair of the dog anyone?'

I'm in.

I remember reading a book about giving up smoking that described being addicted to nicotine as like having a monkey on your back that you were constantly trying to keep happy by feeding it bananas. I can relate to this analogy. The monkey is annoying, yes... but we are friends, I don't mind him living on my back, picking at my nits. If I'm bored we can get up to mischief together; smoke cigars and reminisce about jungle music. He's a reliable buddy and to be honest, I don't mind his red bulbous bottom, it's impressive and very shiny.

I finished the book and stopped smoking. Refusing to feed my furry beast for about 24 hours.... then he got hungry. He scratched me, nudged me and chatted in my ear so I gave in, gave him what he wanted, anyway, I didn't want to cause us to fall out, I was used to having him around. He knows me and I trust him.

I am exactly the same with booze. No matter how good my intentions I couldn't help but feed my habit.

I didn't have the tools or support to stop. When the party was over my monkey friend was nowhere to be seen.  He was just there for the fun bit, the dancing and the funny stories. The fact was i was fed up with him, I needed something new and I needed help.

I didn't have the tools or support to stop. Where was my monkey friend when I needed him? The fact was, I needed something new and I needed help.ack, all day every day. A burden that was affecting my life, ruining it instead of doing what it promised. The disco lights had faded and all that was left on the dance floor was some fag butts and the heel of my shoe. The flirty dancing was gone and the lights were exposing all of my flaws. I was a mess. Drinking had taken its toll and that big gorilla was slowly weighing me down. Eventually, I had to put him down, no, not euthanise him! Geez!, he was just fucking heavy!

Putting down the drink and saying goodbye to my best friend was the hardest yet most rewarding accomplishment of my life. I didn't need him anymore. I missed him, I still do... but our relationship had turned toxic and his breath was repugnant. I set him down and wished him well. His body swayed and his knuckles dragged on the floor as he disappeared over the horizon...

That sums me up, 7 words. Years of back and forth, drinking and not drinking. From dry Julys and sober Octobers to pissed up Christmas's and last man standing (if wonkily) at any social event. I'm a never-ending hangover that knows she can do better.

Having popped out a few brats in recent years has had me questioning my behaviour. Am I someone who gets a tincy wincy bit wasted every now and again or am I an Alcoholic? I'm going to write this blog to find out more about me and people like me. Stuck in a pissed up purgatory, not brave enough to reach out for help and not stupid enough to know there is a problem.

You see...My drinking is socially acceptable, people think I'm fun. You wouldn't pick me out as a total alcoholic in need of intervention because my drinking is absorbed into everyone else's. it's diluted like vodka in orange juice, it's disguised as yummy and extrovert, like a happy fruit punch at a free bar (the only punch I ever got from it was from a dodgy ex-boyfriend) Diluting my problem amongst the crowd meant I  got away with it. it was soaked up into my friend's soggy minor alcohol addictions, making it disappear ...Puff! No questions asked. 

Sundays were  filled with sly comments from friends, hilarious jibes that were laughed off over a bloody Marys, things like,

'she likes a drink that one' or

'you looked like you were having fun last night'

'who was that guy with his tongue in your ear hole?'

'Why are you wearing a sombrero?

All  translate into the same meaning...

'you were fucking wasted and I am better than you because I remember everything!'

Self-righteous bastards -  remember a night out - how boring!

Then I started to wonder why all the funny anecdotes were always about me?

Eventually, comments like these tapped me on the shoulder as I ordered shots. I shrugged them off for a while, until I had kids. that's when I decided to listen, get help.

I've been sober for nearly 18 months.

I want to use this space to track my new way of life... being sober.  Can I still have fun and socialise? 

My children are my reason for trying a new path. I want them to know me without being drenched in booze, too hungover to take care of them properly. There have been times where I wasn't able to be there, be a good Mum. I feel guilty. But do I deserve to get hammered at the end of the week after the grind of Motherhood has ground me down? or am I just making excuses to pour a bottle of wine down my throat on a Thursday afternoon?

is there a better way to deal with life? with nothing to lean on? I will need your support!

I created a new subreddit for people like us," Largely a repost, but I felt it warranted further promotion--and refinement--for those who might have missed it last time around.

I created [r/EndOfTheParTy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndOfTheParTy/) for those of us who are gay and trying to leave the parTy scene. Meth use is unfortunately at an epidemic level in the gay community, and it feels like we often resort to joking and stigmatizing each other about this issue rather than supporting and encouraging each other to make healthier decisions. This will be (I hope) a judgment free space where gay tweakers who are/are trying to get sober can find help through shared experiences and shared resources/approaches.

Please be respectful of the courage it takes to be open about this problem and to seek out help--some of my friends have died from meth overdoses, others are stuck in a living nightmare of permanent and irreversible psychosis. How we respond to people who are vulnerable can make all the difference for them. Please share the subreddit--or maybe [this link](https://www.actoronto.org/health-information/young-people/staying-off-crystal.pdf) about ways to limit and stop meth use--to anyone you think could use help in confronting this difficult, often ridiculed issue.",50,1

I'm nearly 2 years in and  I still think I'm very boring. I cant get the mantra out of my brain that 'drinking is the only way to relax and have fun'. It's hard to change, rewire my way of thinking. I need more time. More sober time to accept this new way of living.

I have moments when I want to rip off my mums blouse and head bang to The Sex Pistols in a grimy underground club. I don't, because there is a bullshit secret etiquette I must adhere to. A secret code of mothers, a code that none of us transcribe to, its just there in the background of our pretend perfect parenting and occasioning slipping out of the mouths of nosey old ladies in libraries. The code seems to have no right answers and no boundaries so its hard to follow. it's impossible... which is why mums love it so much... because then we can watch other mums failing to adhere to these mysterious rules and judge them. Women are fucked up like that.

I don't want sneers at the school gates, so I hide my Anarchy in the UK tshirt by buttoning up my cardigan. I'm helping my community by doing this, not causing a fuss.... keeping the status quo without getting a rockers mullet. Lets just say I have started to dumb myself down since becoming a mum/sober warrior... in order to fit in. Easier for everyone. 

Occasionally I feel smug. I want to shout out how proud I am of me, for getting dry and for being this new sober person. I want to fling open chateau windows like women in perfume ads and yell that I've done something amazing. I want to say to other Mums that you can do it too and we can form an army of do gooders to spread the message... take over the world. But,  I don't, I hide here behind my lap top instead. I sit in a space where  judgement is possible but bearable. where i'm unreachable and unapproachable, out of the way of the.mum rules. I dont want to focus on me doing well. If I'm doing well I'm scared that everything else will fail. Then the warriors crumble.

I am a non-drinker, yes - woo hoo! but it doesn't mean I am doing well at life. I mean, I shat out a sequin this morning. It floated on the water, it looked like a magical unicorn had visited my bog. I'd been doing the hateful and oh so sweary Christmas wrapping while stuffing hummus and dips in my mouth. It sparkeled bright red like Dorothy's ruby slippers as it stubbornly refused to flush down the yellow brick commode. Admittedly my flush timing is weak, I don't have the patience to wait for the refill. I'm working on it.

After excreting half a Christmas tree I hit the beach in my pregnancy bikini. The suns not too hot I think inside my tiny mind (middle of summer in Australia)and  I burnt my body to a crisp.(see pic) My precious bump looked like a rubber ball, it had a shine to it for three days. I do stupid things a lot. I put my reading  glasses in the fridge. I  talk to answering machines. I wave at ducks. I send my son to school with blocks of cheese instead of lunch. I do all sorts of silly things. dumb decisions with relatively minor consequences and occasional speeding tickets.

Now  my sillies are forgettable - sober sillies I like to call them. When I compare them to my drunken sillies it makes my determination to never drink again as strong as a shot of absinthe on a Sunday morning. The things that I used to were way more dangerous, risky drinking things, foolish mistakes that could have led to rape, injury or death. Its such a massive difference to now. Shitting a sequin is much safer than sleeping with a stranger with wooden teeth and a bag of speed.  Retrieving my reading glasses from the fridge is better than walking  across spooky parks all alone or falling asleep in a grave yard. 

Waking up, feeling good knowing that the worst I have done is go to bed without putting the dish washer on is the kind of chaotic life I'm into now. it's life  - simplified. It's sobriety at its best.

Stopping drinking doesn't stop the daily grind, it doesn't stop the mundanity of caring for young children and it certainly doesn't give me a muggy feeling of being better than anyone else but it does cancel out all the shittiness, the panic, the dread, the shame and the morning after pill. it enables me to live life face on. run towards the fire because I know I can be of help. Sobriety makes me a functional person... a person that is great sometimes and rubbish at other times.

So, I break the unwritten mummy rules  - the one that says I should drink wine. I'm out. 

Actually  - I'm not out... I'm in. I'm always in!

is it 8pm yet? wayyyy past this punks bedtime.",10,0

It has utterly ruined my life. The only thing I have left is that Im not dead. I want to be happy again. I want to find love and peace. I just want this depression to stop. The obsession with all of my failures almost keeps me from getting out of bed. I just want normal things. I want to not feel tbe crushing weight of my financial debt from a life of bad choices. I want to be someone people can look at as a decent person who is capable of sharing a life worth living with those around me. Im not sure what Im trying to say. Im just tired of feeling alone and living a life that doesnt feel like who I truly am or what Im capable of. I want that one last get out of jail free card to start over. But I know thats not how things work. Anyway thanks for reading.,15,0

i have 19 months clean, with varying levels of commitment to the program in that time. id say right now my commitment to the program is at the ""literally nothing"" level. no sponsor, one meeting every like three weeks at best. surprise: ive been having obsessive thoughts about my drug of choice. every day its on my mind. whats troublesome is these thoughts are no longer idle fantasy. it feels like ive basically decided to relapse. 

i havent done it yet because of some special circumstances. six months ago i moved to mexico. it's been great. i love it. i dont want to ruin mexico by making it ""the place i relapsed.""  plus i want my drug, not booze, and im not trying to do illegal stuff down here. finally im going to stay with my parents for a bit when i go back to the states in ten days. theyre in the program too and itll just complicate shit if they know i relapsed. if i relapse itll be when ive installed myself in my own place. 

(side note: the fellowship down here is great and i speak spanish so my lack of involvement in the program is purely my own fault.) 

so redditors in recovery, the sane part of me kind of knows im better off if i dont relapse, even though i really want to. how do you recover from an emotional relapse like this, without actually relapsing?",3,0

It's worth it. I'm glad I got out of the house instead of staying in bed.

In my experience, the first 30 days was a very dark time. I could have failed at any moment. My biggest help was routine. I scheduled my entire waking day in 30 minute installments. I kept a journal and sat down every morning before work and planned my day. It included bedtime/wake up time, hygiene, work, meetings, therapy, meals, chores, etc. I would fill any idle time with walks, exercise, trips to the library and coffee at the local AA club. This rigid structure allowed me to shift my focus away from my addictive behaviors for long enough to let the compulsive thoughts pass. I think this will be a great help to our brothers and sisters who are new to, or looking to start recovery.
