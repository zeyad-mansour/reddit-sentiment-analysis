Recovery to me is being in a process of change through which I improve my health and wellness of my own volition. My recovery date is the day before my sobriety date and marks the day I began changing. It took me 10 years of substance use, suicidal ideation, homelessness, a felony conviction, and compulsive lying to ask for help. 6 years ago I told my parents that I would go wherever they sent me and didn't want to suffer anymore. The next day I was on a plane to a treatment facility. I didn't know how to stop yet so I was using until the point of admission. I wasn't willing to commit to abstinence of substance use (specifically alcohol) for the rest of my life while in treatment despite my therapists insistence that I should. I did commit to giving abstinence a try temporarily. Today I've committed to being able to say one day that ""I have been sober longer than I was using"". My goal in the beginning of recovery and to this day is to be happy. I also have a rule that if life ever gets as bad as it was before (homeless,prison,etc) without me using I can start again. My life has grown into something I couldn't have ever hoped for or imagined. I have an apartment of my own, a car, two pet reptiles, a job working at a psychiatric hospital, and have returned to college. I have the trust of my family, friends, self respect, integrity, and a girlfriend. I share this about myself not for the likes and affirmations, but to inform. Recovery is unique to each one of us. Yours might not look like mine, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid. Recovery isn't linear. There was a point two years in where I found myself considering drinking over a relationship ending despite all the progress I'd made. Recovery is more than just sobriety. I have a laundry list of behaviors outside of substance use that needed to be addressed for me to enjoy life without use. Recovery is possible. I didn't think it was before I tried, but my lived experience has proven me wrong beyond any shadow of doubt. If you are suffering and lack recovery, may you find the strength to ask for help if you haven't already. May you find the motivation to do the hardest work you will likely ever do. May you find your recovery and the refuge that it offers.",33,0

I’m currently in an on and off relationship with someone who’s in rehab for alcoholism. 

Here’s a back story. We’ve been together for 6+yrs. I was on a health kick when we met. I was attracted to her overwhelming sense of humor. Shortly after seeing each other I noticed that she used alcohol a more than normal. Over time I started using alcohol in order to have a more carefree interaction. My choices have gotten me in some trouble in the past I will admit but I took care of them, I went to court did the classes and got them resolved. I have a job and I’m continuing to try to better myself. The last two years of her drinking had become troublesome, affecting day to day life. She would go on sprees for days then expecting to come back and acting like this was normal. Every time she came back I still opened my home up to her. Over many times I finally said she couldn’t stay with me anymore. We still stayed together but I got so tired of the verbal abuse and the drinking in general so I started distancing myself. She would still call when she needed food, personal care items etc… it got so bad that she was staying with random people who drank just to do it with them. Her own family didn’t even know where she would be for weeks. Finally, she ran out of friends and had lost all of her belongs including any money she had. She reached out to a cousin that was in a rehab facility who convinced her to go there. That was amazing because prior to that she would not hear of rehab or any type of therapy. So she was picked up and started treatment. 

It’s been about 4 months now and her whole attitude has changed, some for the better and some for the worse. I’m happy for her sobriety and I’m her biggest cheerleader! However, she started degrading me about not going to rehab or getting help for myself. She always talks on and on about herself in a way that makes me feel inferior to her, almost like she’s bragging. She has become mean and makes me feel like a lowlife. Whenever I address the ways she’s hurt me in the past, that still affects my feelings, she tells me that I’m a negative person and that I only wanna live in the past. According to my own personal therapy, you are thought to acknowledge your past and make amends to those that you have hurt, make right the things you have wronged. Her personality has almost become grandiose. I can feel the passion we once had fading as she changes. It seems like can’t have a normal conversation. It’s like I don’t know her anymore. 

What stops me from letting go is that I been by her side all these years and I feel like I’d be giving up on her. I truly do love and care about her which is also why it’s difficult for me. Am I just holding onto hope? Does anyone have any advice for me?",7,1

She respected my boundaries and did not smoke around me as she agreed upon. Most things were going wonderfully. But over time I believe she started to interpret my pride in being sober as someone who looks down on those that drink and drug, and so she broke up with me. This was because of a host of reasons not just drugs and alcohol but drugs certainly were a large part. Regardless of the actual reason, I’ve started to reach out to others in my recovery in person and online in order to hear their experience strength and hope. I want to own my side of the street and the decisions of my past however I am a bit lost when it comes to the substance use of a significant other. So...

Behind fear & insecurities, it's laziness that's holding you back.

The more I strategize, the more the chances of procrastination or dropping it altogether. Or, strategising can be a form of escapism in itself.

Cold hard action trumps everything. When in doubt, dive headfirst (socially speaking).

You can't trust your mind.

Generally, people have a tendency to subtly abuse the underconfident, & you would mistakenly think they would understand/pity you for your shortcomings. So, always err toward being selfishly & impunitively assertive about your wants but without being self centered.

""A king can't ever get stressed, no matter what."" --- one of my lecturer when he was explaining about politicians' attitude even in the time of crisis.

Everything that you do is for stimulation, even the worry that keep playing inside like a loop.

Boring is good.

No other way to rapid evolution other than facing fear regularly. You either feel the friction daily or you stay timid till you turn senile & die. Throw yourself in situations that demand you to sink or swim.

The above mentioned friction is fearsome before getting up, feels nothing/neutral during the grind, feels good after.

All worries, anxiety & paralysing fear are fed more the more you sit around. The more you move around, you start to feel like making a killing.

The way of the body/physicality dictates the way of the mind. So be active physically & exercise intensely everyday.

Addiction is replaced by another addiction. Habit is replaced by another habit.

Everything that you do, your particular attitude toward something, your reactions, a course of actions, any kind of thought, etc. is an exercise unto itself. It grows the more you do & diminishes when you don't.

Environment makes or breaks your character. Be aware of what you stay with & where you stay.

Being decisive is underrated.

Always stay with the underlying truth (for example, ignore futures contracts, research on the value of the underlying securities itself); Always operate with the broader picture & longer term in space-time; Avoid any activity/event/stimulation that is quick & cheap.

At any given time, you know what's right deep down & you know what to do. You just have to give in to that. (For example, everyone knows here that reddit is just escapism & using it to hide from reality)

I am dual diagnosis and work with a psychiatrist which presents some interesting dynamics with my recovery.  I have a severe panic/ anxiety disorder that prevents me from doing normal life stuff I and have tried SSRIs over the years (side effects were intolerable for me and I had to stop), Wellbutrin (also intolerable side effects). I am now on a med which seems to be a decent maintenance med for anxiety that has not caused any side effects (no feelings of intoxication either).  I have also been prescribed a long acting benzodiazepine for years to be taken on an as needed basis.  Surprisingly, I actually take it as needed and have never developed a physical dependence to it despite having abused Xanax and other short acting benzos fairly heavily in the past.  I just never found this particular one to be “fun”.  That said, I have a lot of guilt when I do take it.  I always second guess myself wondering if I really need it at a particular time or if I should try powering through the anxious sensations.  Further more I have some bottles (yes bottles because I don’t take it often and always have a bunch left over) that say take up to 2mg and others that say up to 1 mg.  I typically take 1mg but I have taken 2mg once in my recent sobriety.  My doctor says there is flexibility in dosing needs despite what is written in the bottle but I play it safe and have never exceed the max 2mg. 

Sponsor knows I take this medication.  I just can’t help but feel like I am cheating sometimes… eventually I want to not have this medication in my life at all and I even almost dumped them recently.  My sponsor and wife both advised that I do not dump them yet.  Can anyone here relate?",15,0

Benzo/THC addiction.,"Thank you to anyone who take's the time to read, respond or offer any input.  I have no one else to talk to about this, I've went thru this journey alone so far, and it's been so very hard.  I wish I had people I could reach out to, how ever I would just been called an addict and passed along.  


So the issue, I have been using cannabis for around 3 years with a medical card, Suddenly smoking started to give me anxiety rather then help.  It got to the point I could not eat, or drink anything ( Not alcohol but anything) I turned to some benzo's I had from a year before.  Started with just .25 to goto sleep and this would curve my pain for an entire day.

Within 6 months I was taking 4mg a day spread out through-out the day to give me a full time anxiety relief.  It was at this point I seen that I was living life on auto pilot and could not remember anything I was doing the day before.  


I have a business , It started to impact my ability to work.   Around Christmas time 12/26/20 I decided to try and get control.  This was not easy, No one knows I was taking the xanax. I could not tell anyone what I had going on.  As I tapered off slowly (One month later was down to around 2.5MG a day) how ever my smoking was increasing, my mood was horrible and stomach pains were coming back.  To give you an idea I was consuming around 1G of live rosin a day.  


I kept moving forward and lowering my benzo dosage slowly, Every week I would force myself to take it less, push how long my anxiety attacks would come on, It started to become apparent every time I would smoke, it would make my nerves just go crazy, hand cramps, and chest pain.  The start of August, now 8 months into this I am down to taking .25mg ONLY before bedtime.  2 weeks ago I have up smoking THC all together cold turkey.  It has been hell,  moving forward seems pointless, it's hard to feel joy or happiness or the desire to even feel those things.

&#x200B;

It's become apparent to me that dealing with quitting both at the same time is a living hell, how ever the love I have for my family is what I use to push through all of this.  I do not ever want my parent's to get a phone call that I could not over come my addiction they don't even know I have. Some of you may say to turn to them, but it's just not a option for me. I would not be helped, how ever ridiculed and looked down on.

&#x200B;

So here I am, 2 weeks clean of THC , .25mg of benzo before bed.  I have been down to this dosage now to 2 weeks. (.25mg before bed nothing else)  By 8-9 PM I know my body is looking for it, The sweats come on, the headache, the hand cramping.

&#x200B;

Today is a important day for me, I am trying to gain the strength to stop taking them all together, I went to sleep last night with NO benzo for first time in over a year. I probably sweat enough to fill two water bottles.  I am able to sleep for 45min to one hour long periods before feeling anxiety.  I just think about random things that make me happy until I fall back asleep.  


As I type this 36 hours without any benzo,  Sweating, headache seem to be 8/10, I feel some what jittery.

&#x200B;

Am I going to make it? Is there hope? Will I be able to stop after getting down to .25mg daily or should I go lower? I have only 3 bar's left, I can continue to ween off if needed, But I really just want to be myself again.

If this was horrible to read, I am sorry its hard to compose a full story like this about myself and keep a clear head, If you made it this far.. Thank you.",20,0

**Basic Text, p. 15**

&#x200B;

Active addiction is a smoldering death-wish.   Each of us courted death every time we used.  Our lifestyles, too, put  us at risk.  The life of an addict is sold cheaply with every day and  every dose.

In recovery, the first pattern we change is the  pattern of using.  Staying clean is the start of our journey into  life.  But our self-destructive behavior usually went far deeper than  just our using.  Even in recovery, we may still treat ourselves as if we  are worthless.  When we treat ourselves badly, we feel badly.  And when  we feel badly, we seek relief—maybe even in our old solution, drugs.

Choosing recovery means choosing life.  We  decide each day that we want to live and be free.  Each time we avoid  self-destructive behavior, we choose recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will choose life by choosing recovery.  I will take care of myself.

The norm used to be this: A positive test or arrest for hard drugs meant you were sent to a substance abuse counselor, who announced that you have a drug problem and need treatment.

Or, at minimum, that an assessment would take place to make that determination, and part of that would come from monitoring your *receptiveness* to drug education you were ordered to receive -- instructions to stop getting high.

Times are changing; more and more people push for this: Nov. 2020: [NPR: From Marijuana To Mushrooms, Voters Want Drug Laws Eased](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931507602/from-marijuana-to-mushrooms-voters-want-drug-laws-eased). Those two are so-called soft drugs, but  advocacy  for hard drugs is following. Drug policy reformer and [author Carl Hart](https://old.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/ls2l9v/discussion_university_professor_suggests_70_of/), who discusses his heroin use, is one such commentator. Hart convincingly argues that about 70% of hard drug users are not addicts. (FN) In [a 2021 interview with Joe Rogan,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4xMbq7gLEjFioOQ5gpSw2l) speaking of hard drugs, Hart also says:

>""You should fight for your right, your liberty to use drugs."" @ 22:40

This subversive comment seems to be widely appreciated. Many recreational hard drug users today tell counselors in police drug-diversion programs to take a hike. And similarly dismiss counselors under the *Counseling-Rehab-Model* -- which has been widely promoted as a replacement for ending the War on Drugs. Some addicts deny that they are addicts, deny that they have a problem, and are similarly defiant about their right to use drugs.

Interesting thing: 20 years ago, most drug policy reformers, architects of the Counseling-Rehab Model, would have denounced Hart's comment.

>""We do not support any hard drug use.  We council against it. We believe the Counseling-Rehab Model can address America drug problems.  Having law enforcement threaten and sanction any users is inappropriate.""

Today -- quite the change. Seems there is more tolerance for hard drugs from the very people who are supposed to council against it. Often it is a *wink, wink* thing. *Counselor:*  ""I advise that you stop using cocaine recreationally. I hope you don't get sent to me again.""  If the War on Drugs is phased out--a lot of people are now advocating this--is the Counseling-Rehab-Model going to suppress any appreciable amount of recreational drug use in America? How so?

= = =

FN: This 70% is a  ballpark figure.  And a better analysis would peg hard drug users on a continuum; example: 1) 30% - use without problem; 2) 40% - use with no major issues, but some impacts occur, e.g., use hinders high-level economic achievement, 3) 15% addicted -  Functional but can't hold a job over time; 4) 15% - addicted and seriously debilitated; hardcore alcoholics and chronic heroin injectors are examples.  Figures would vary for each drug, e.g.: heroin vs. meth vs. powder cocaine, etc. Complicating further:  many people chronically use multiple drugs.",8,0

Around 2 years ago, I realized I was seriously addicted to pornography and masturbation. This was after I “did it” multiple times in a row and just couldn’t stop. I couldn’t get my work done because of constant brain fog (masturbating makes me sleepy which causes temporary brain fog) from masturbating so much, and I couldn’t even start on it because I just had an urge to masturbate first. I was constantly triggered by the slightest thing it was a disaster.

I decided I need to go cold turkey completely - for the same reason a recovered alcoholic will never drink alcohol again, even though technically small amounts can be healthy. The same idea applies to masturbation for me, but of course on a more minor scale.

I lurked subreddits like r/pornfree, r/nofap, among others yet I never really succeeded. I’ve just had a few long positive streaks where I actually stayed off it, and those were great times for me. 

However in the past month suddenly it spiked and got so bad I can’t even go 20 hours without “doing it” anymore. I masturbate 2-4 times a day and lose multiple hours of my life DAILY simply “doing it” which means I have no time left for what’s important. I’m not as productive, I’m not spending as much time with my family, it is terrible I wish upon no one.

**Every time I even go in public, I am so easily and strongly triggered by everyone in public I hate it.**

#yes I have tried most tips like workout, transmute, build habits, just don’t think about it, have a strong purpose, ETC. but they don’t really fix the core problem which is that I am ALWAYS TRIGGERED WAY TOO EASILY.

If I don’t have time during the day to masturbate, then I will somehow find a way to sacrifice sleep to do it

How the hell do people quit hard drugs like heroine? I get you can distance yourself from the drug by it surely must not be that easy right? There must be a method that so many of you use to quit so succesfly. Any help would be appreciated

**Edit: 

Mines is a little different. I never feel this overwhelming physical or mental urge to use. I merely get into this mode of im gonna do it and don’t give a shit. I don’t really feel any urge, but nonetheless I can’t stop. It’s like I have no free will. Other than that, the only symptom I experience that I would consider to be addictive behaviour is the angst I feel 30 minutes before I do it. It’s like I just have to do it now.**",4,0

I do want a reminder for down the line. It feels nice, but all the ones on Etsy and stuff have a verse on the back about God and stuff. And just as a disclaimer, I am somewhat religious in the sense that I have beliefs about the unknown to comfort me, but not specific to any one religion. But not anti-religion by any means as long as you respect all people, so please don't think I am bashing on religion by any means! And I just don't really vibe with the whole God verse stuff, especially as an LGBT+ person as well.  
  
But I do still want a nice chip, I don't mind worldwide shipping. Does anyone know where to get ones that have some more basic stuff on the back, or other words of inspiration? Bonus points if it's not specific to AA but it's fine if not.",11,0

I just got off papers in 2018 so I could finally leave the country. 2019 Mexico City, wasn’t sober, and my cousins wedding in Milwaukee I was drugging. I OD twice in one week, second time heart stopped for 4mins. As many horrible and deep rock bottoms I hit, something clicked with this one cause my brother found me both times, saved my life both times and he thought I was dead. 

That’s pretty traumatic to witness. So we plan a family trip to Cancun, my brother and I owe it to our parents to give them a stress free vacation. IV coke was my worst problem, and I thought about it and the availability of coke here. (I do smoke medical marijuana). 

While walking the beach this gentleman pulls out a bag of straight fish scale, even offers me a free taste. I don’t drink much but when I do it makes me tired and makes blow sound so much more better but I told him no thank you, I saw the blow and just kept it moving.

And Not Enough,"I was fortunate enough to find recovery two years, three months, and nine days ago.  Using a twelve step fellowship to the best of my ability and a behavioral health program, helped me be able to help myself. Somewhere along the line my career path shifted and I ended up working in Recovery at the very treatment center I graduated from.  Now I am almost to the top just underneath the director and I couldn't be more miserable.

It started by overhearing some things when I first started working there. I ignored it and assumed it wasn't a big deal.  They couldn't really have a blatant disregard for what is best for the clients.  As my title changed, the more I found out that wasn't true.  I had this dream that working there would be so fulfilling and rewarding.  The only things I deal with are death, relapse, and problems.  There isn't any light in the position I am in.  I am the angel of death it feels like sometimes.

I tried to accept this and be able to continue work.  I tried using the view point that in the business of recovery. It is a product that needs to be marketed and sold. With that being said no company wants their product to last forever. They want it to be purchased again and again when the previous product quits working.  Thats what a for-profit rehabilitation center is doing.  So, I tried to view my work as my work and keep my recovery and what I have to do for myself completely separate.

This worked for a while. Until I began to sacrifice what I believe to be right and started serving out injustices because it was what I was told to do.  This job has caused me to go against what I believe in and the morals that I decided to live by until I became spiritually bankrupt.  I'm not writing this to deter anybody from seeking treatment because if you go for the right reasons you will succeed. Not because of the staff or the facility.  Its because you had what you needed inside you all along and just needed the time to wake it up and do what you have to do.  I'm writing this so that I have closure and I can move on from this Job and find peace.  Then get back on the road to being the person I wanted to be.",13,0

I have a friend who cares about me deeply and she’s worried about me cause I tell her anything but she can only do so much.

I was determined I was going to drink it. My heart was pounding and all my progress was on the line. I ultimately poured the glass down the drain and made it through the bight.

Friend from NA told me has feelings for me, knows that I'm waiting til I hit a year before I even consider a relationship","I'm feeling a lot of feelings. I'd been very clear in the past with him about the myriad reasons I'm not ready for a relationship, and why I don't trust people who are interested in me to be my friend-mainly my ex who kept pressuring me for a relationship when we were friends, he'd say it wasn't fair on him for me to withhold physical intimacy when he was attracted to me.

SO this guy who I've been friends with for a few months now.. We went out to the movies for my birthday, had a good night, after I got home he texted and told me that he'd wanted to kiss me and didn't because I'd said I didn't want that and he was respecting my decision. Later, he said he was developing strong feelings for me. I'm angry and disappointed. He has over a year clean and works in a recovery support service. Did he want me to thank him for not trying anything?? My knee jerk reaction is that I want to tell him he's being selfish by feeling the need to tell me that. I feel much less comfortable with him as a friend now. I'd like some other points of view please. I don't have many friends. I'd like to be less angry and I don't want this to be a resentment. Thanks in advance

Update
I sent him a message ""My boundary was that I don't want a relationship until I've been clean at least a year. Also that talking about physical intimacy makes me uncomfortable. As I'm sure you're aware people in early recovery, as I am, are generally known to be somewhat vulnerable so it's frowned upon to try anything with them especially if you have more clean time. This whole situation makes me reconsider how I feel towards you and your intentions towards me.""
And he wrote back
"" I am truly sorry for making you feel uncomfortable, the thing is I like everything about you.  I really do enjoy spending time with you and I fully understand and respect your boundary.
I am too still working on myself, body, mind and spirt.  My intentions towards you have and are always respectful. ""

What is going on?,"3 years ago I cleaned myself up from a hard and heavy cocaine addiction. I had completely spiraled out, checked myself into rehab, and have never touched it again. 

I remember counselors in rehab and AA meetings saying that during recovery, we would have dreams about using and to not let it throw us off. I never had any dreams like that, until recently. 

In the past 2-3 months, I've been having cocaine use dreams more and more frequently. The thing is, I haven't thought about using, I'm not in an environment where it is around me at all, and I have no interest in returning to those habits. The dreams are getting more intense, in them I am using a lot and reverting to old habits of hiding and being sneaky about it. In the dreams I am worried about getting caught. It is like I am rabid for it like at the peak of my addiction.

Why after 3 years have these dreams popped up seemingly out of nowhere? I am very happy in my life now. I have stability, a full-time job, restored family relationships (none use), moved states, cut out nearly everyone from my ""old life"", have a great relationship with a normie, and am making solid plans for my future. I have no desire to use again.

What the fuck? Anyone else have this happen? Should I be going back to meetings? How do I make them stop? I do not like having these dreams.",14,0

Mid20s. I’ve suffered from depression since I was a kid, and it only ever felt like It went away when I transitioned to heavy drug addiction. I had a year clean this time last year and for the most part I felt pretty good. I still struggled some days but wasn’t suicidal. I relapsed in the spring but got clean again (although have had a couple slip ups but they’ve only been a day here or there) and ever since getting clean again a couple months ago I just feel like every day is agony. I feel so alone like I have no one to talk to, I feel like I have no friends and just kind of like a burden. I’m living with my parents right now while I try and finish college (it took me so long since I was strung out on heroin for the past 7 years which also makes me depressed but that’s another story), and before that I always lived alone or with my ex. Like I said I’ve always been depressed I just used to mask it with drugs. I also have a lot of trauma (finding my bf of five years dead, rape etc) but I don’t think really any of it is the cause of my depression  I just feel like I see no light at the end of the tunnel.  I have enormous trouble opening up with how i feel to anyone, even my parents who are incredibly supportive and my biggest advocates despite all I’ve put them thru.  They’re strongly encouraging (or should i say requiring) me to go back to therapy but I hate talking about how i feel or my depression because i always feel like someone is going to think Im overreacting and I’m just bad at opening up. I’ve tried to kill myself twice (once probably three years ago and once a couple weeks ago) and I’m seriously considering it again.  Therapy has never worked for me or really made me feel any better. I’m open to trying new medicine but I know that can take a long time and I honestly don’t know if I can wait that long. I literally sit around all day and cry or feel like crying, do a little schoolwork, sit on my phone, and just feel hopeless. I know people say in early sobriety it’s normal to feel like this, but I’ve been sober before and still feel like this. I do still smoke weed, and sometimes I’m like fuck it I might as well do hard drugs again at least sometimes I had a false sense of happiness. I just don’t know what to do if it was not for my parents I think I would have jumped off a bridge by now.

In 2016, I was hungover for the millionth time and mortally embarrassed. I decided (out of desperation and loneliness) to google ""12 steps sober meetings near me help"" or something like that and went to a meeting. I met a ton of people who I'm still friends with today and can't believe 1) I tried that and 2) that it stuck! (What I thought it would be vs. what it was like is actually soooooo different.)

Since it's my fifth anniversary, I thought I'd share five things that helped me:

*- ask for help and then accept it*

More people than you think want you to get better and will actively help you. It helps them to help you and it isn't that big a deal. I HATE admitting I need help but I'm getting better at it.

*- acknowledge your feelings*

I'm working with a trauma therapist to deal with having real human feelings -- something I've never enjoyed. Sometimes I give up and cry and that's a big difference from feeling like I had to just push through and never show anyone that I was struggling

*- ""finished, not perfect""*

An artist on Youtube said he had a sticky note above his desk that said ""finished, not perfect"" to remind himself that it's better to just get through something than languish about it and angst because it isn't perfect. I take that advice to heart in my comics, but also just in life. Sometimes I can do SOME of the chores/errands/tasks I set out to do -- badly -- vs. just sit there, overwhelmed.

*- don't cut corners*

People in 12 step meetings say related ideas to this, like ""keep your side of the street clean"" or ""do the next right thing"" and for me, I have to catch myself when I'm slipping back into old behaviors. Those corner-cutting moves can lead me into spiraling back into unhealthy shit.

*- stay teachable*

As an atheist, I assumed that 12 step meetings and support groups would have a lot to do with God and -- as someone raised in the Bible Belt -- I have a lotta baggage with capital G god. It turns out, ""faith"" and ""Higher Power"" can mean a ton of things to a ton of different people. I now think of faith as ""faith in recovery"" and I can pray, meditate, and have spiritual moments that don't have to do with Religion. I pray at my worst moments (""universe, give the serenity...""), take a few moments out of my day to meditate, and don't dismiss religious people outright.

I never, ever thought I'd get sober, and now so many people have helped me that I'm happy to repay the favor. If you're struggling today, and doing what I did and googling ""how to get sober"", ""Easy way to get sober"", ""stop drinking"", ""how to not do drugs"", don't give up. THERE IS HOPE FOR YOU, TOO. <3",105,0

**Basic Text, p. 102**

Every life has a beginning and an end.   However, when someone we love a great deal reaches the end of their  life, we may have a very hard time accepting their sudden, final  absence.  Our grief may be so powerful that we fear it will completely  overwhelm us—but it will not.  Our sorrow may hurt more than anything we  can remember, but it will pass.

We need not run from the emotions that may  arise from the death of a loved one.  Death and grieving are parts of  the fullness of living “life on life’s terms.”  By allowing ourselves  the freedom to experience these feelings, we partake more deeply of both  our recovery and our human nature.

Sometimes the reality of another’s death makes  our own mortality that much more pronounced.  We reevaluate our  priorities, appreciating the loved ones still with us all the more.  Our  life, and our life with them, will not go on forever.  We want to make  the most of what’s most important while it lasts.

We might find that the death of someone we love  helps strengthen our conscious contact with our Higher Power.  If we  remember that we can always turn to that source of strength when we are  troubled, we will be able to stay focused on it no matter what may be  going on around us.

**Just for today:**  I will accept the loss  of one I love and turn to my Higher Power for the strength to accept my  feelings.  I will make the most of my love for those in my life today.

It’s been said that recovery is simple—all we’ve got to change is *everything*!   That can seem a pretty tall order, especially when we first arrive in  Narcotics Anonymous.  After all, not many of us showed up at our first  meeting because our lives were in great shape.  On the contrary, a great  many of us came to NA in the midst of the worst crises of our lives.   We needed recovery, and quick!

The enormity of the change required in our  lives can be paralyzing.  We know we can’t take care of all that needs  to be done, not all at once.  How do we start?  Chances are, we’ve  already started.  We’ve done the first, most obvious things that needed  to be done: We’ve stopped using drugs, and we’ve started going to  meetings.

What do we do next?  Pretty much the same  thing, just more of it:  From where we are, we do what we can.  We walk  the path of recovery by picking up our feet and taking the step that’s  right in front of us.  Only when that’s been accomplished must we  concern ourselves with what comes next.  Slowly but surely, we’ll find  ourselves making progress down the path, visibly drawing closer each day  to becoming the kind of person we’d like to be.

**Just for today:**  I will walk the path of my recovery by taking the step right in front of me.

Tomorrow I'm supposed to start my road to recovery. But so far everyday I find a way around it. I already downloaded a clean time counter app, and every day I go in and switch the day to begin tomorrow. And when the next day comes, I find a way to make it happen, and so I will again start my recovery tomorrow. My head is full of terrible, negative thoughts. My stomach is full of anxiety. I am so terrified of moving forward, I'm literally standing still, if not even moving backwards every day. I'm doing this on my own. I have no friends. No one knows my situation. I'm a secret addict. I have been for years. I do smoke pot, but that's actually something I'm going to continue using. I've never drank alcohol in my life. But H is my drug of choice. And lately I've been smoking crack all day every day too. I can't believe I actually just told the truth. That's never been done before. I've been using the H since I was widowed in 2012. The cocaine usage has been a part of my life for about two years now. I don't even know what to do with myself minute to minute. It's like I have to learn how to live again. How do I get through this?! I'd rather not think of all this stuff. I am on severe depression meds. Meds for anxiety too but I don't take them anymore (long story). How do I make it definitely tomorrow I'll start? It's almost like I need someone to hold my hand through this. This is f*cked. I'm a smart gal. I know better. I should never have started. When they say addiction can touch anyone, it's true. You'd NEVER think I do what I do. I'm just like any other addict. Except I'm very lucky I didn't have to sell myself, or rob anybody to get what I wanted. And actually that's kind of why I really don't have to start tomorrow. But I want to. But that's the angel on one shoulder talking. The devil on the other says have a great one last day... thanks for reading all the way to the end of this rant. I don't need you to tell me anything. But if you have nice thought, feel free to leave it for me. Well, I'll stay in touch. Hopefully, my recovery will start tomorrow. Every one says it always ends badly. It doesn't. Now, I just need it to end. Only I can prevent forest fires.",11,0

**Basic Text, p. 106**

&#x200B;

The meetings have been great!  Each night we’ve  attended, we’ve gathered with other addicts to share experience,  strength, and hope.  And each day, we’ve used what we’ve learned in the  meetings to continue in our recovery.

Meanwhile, life goes on.  Work, family,  friends, school, sport, entertainment, community activities, civic  obligations—all call out for our time.  The demands of everyday living  sometimes make us ask ourselves, “How long do I have to go to these  meetings?”

Let’s think about this.  Before coming to  Narcotics Anonymous, could we stay clean on our own?  What makes us  think we can now?  Then there’s the disease itself to consider—the  chronic self-centeredness, the obsessiveness, the compulsive behavior  patterns that express themselves in so many areas of our lives.  Can we  live and enjoy life without effective treatment for our disease?  No.

“Ordinary” people may not have to worry about  such things, but we’re not “ordinary” people—we’re addicts.  We can’t  pretend we don’t have a fatal, progressive illness, because we do.   Without our program, we may not survive to worry about the demands of  work, school, family, or anything else.  NA meetings give us the support  and direction we need to recover from our addiction, allowing us to  live the fullest lives possible.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I want to live and enjoy life.  To do that, I will put my recovery first.

I would go to groups twice a day and do an individual session at least once a week. Once the pandemic started I stopped doing groups and just did an individual session over the phone once a week. Well recently I got a new counselor and he was asking if I’d want to start some groups again. They are still doing them virtually and I was like “ehhh not really because of my work schedule and taking care of my child etc.” My counselor just dropped it and we continued sessions once a week. 

Recently my work schedule has changed so I was like “yeah so maybe I will attend some groups again.” Well today I called into the virtual group and was a bit anxious being the new person and all. I also felt a little like I was intruding or that I shouldn’t still be in groups at almost 2 years clean. I know it’s kinda silly of me to feel that way but I had a lot of mixed emotions. 

Everyone in the group had less than a few months clean and it was very humbling to hear them all share and introduce themselves. I was mentally transported back to the struggles that are more prevalent in early recovery. Of course legal issues and not being trusted by family/friends are still things that may haunt me from time to time at this point in my recovery. It just was a nice reminder to not take any length of recovery time for granted. 

Participating in a group setting and actively finding ways to relate my past experiences with others was so refreshing. I have been debating becoming some sort of peer advocate recovery coach type but I wasn’t sure. Now I am feeling more confident and empowered by my recovery. It feels so great and I don’t have any family to really share this experience with so thank you for being here for me! 

Also I did see in the rules there is no promotion of companies but I am curious about how you begin to get started in helping others in recovery. Not necessarily as a career but just to be there for others to reach out to.",31,1

I try to fix myself every night and every morning I wake up with a totally new headspace, completely forgetting about the night before, or forcing it out of my memory. Every night I hate myself, and each morning after I just repress it and feel totally okay with my use. Last night I had somewhat of a revelation. What am I willing to do different? What do I physically need to do to get the fuck out of active addiction? And the only thing I came up with, that I’ve never been able to do, is to be honest with those who are like me and those who love me. Last night I realized that the guilt and shame of my use is what’s been keeping me high, not just the voices in my head. Here’s where my disease starts trying to keep me in the darkness, I’m terrified of telling the truth, admitting all of my failures that have appeared to be wins, and then falling flat again. I don’t want to expose myself just to go back out, pretty much. So I opened my local NA Groups fb page to find the JFT, all about getting yourself out of isolation with the power of honesty. I feel ready, maybe I want to keep using and that’s my downfall, but I’m just afraid this mindset is going to dissipate as soon as my partner wakes up, the person who hits me because I can’t. Every morning I wait on him to wake up in anticipation of using, this morning is no different, but I truly don’t want to use anymore. It’s literally just a part of our everyday routine. I feel trapped. I love him, but I use him using as an excuse to keep fucking myself up. I don’t want to leave him, but I obviously can’t get clean in a house where he still uses. The longest I’ve had in 4 years is 5 days, and he was using every single day. I don’t even think leaving is an option, we have a son together. This post is a mess so I’ll just leave it at that. How do I muster up the courage to be honest when I’m destined to fail. I’m so scared of dying, I’m scared of losing my partner, I’m scared of starting over with my son and these fears are literally going to keep me stuck and end up killing me. I guess I’m just ranting at this point, the honesty i portray behind this throwaway Reddit is the most freedom I’ve had in a long time time so it’s more of a diary entry I guess.

**Basic Text, p. 83**

&#x200B;

Truth connects us to life while fear,  isolation, and dishonesty alienate us from it.  As using addicts, we hid  as much of the truth about ourselves from as much of the world as we  possibly could.  Our fear kept us from opening ourselves up to those  around us, providing protection against what others might do if we  appeared vulnerable.  But our fear also kept us from connecting with our  world.  We lived like alien beings on our own planet, always alone and  getting lonelier by the minute.

The Twelve Steps and the fellowship of  recovering addicts give people like us a place where we can feel safe  telling the truth about ourselves.  We are able to honestly admit our  frustrating, humbling powerlessness over addiction because we meet many  others who’ve been in the same situation—we’re safe among them.  And we  keep on telling more of the truth about ourselves as we continue to work  the steps.  The more we do, the more truly connected we feel to the  world around us.

Today, we need not hide from the reality of  our relations with the people, places, and things in our lives.  We  accept those relationships just as they are, and we own our part in  them.  We take time every day to ask, “Am I telling the truth about  myself?”  Each time we do this, we draw that much further away from the  alienation that characterizes our addiction, and that much closer to the  freedom recovery can bring us.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  Truth is my connection to reality.  Today, I will take time to ask myself, “Am I telling the truth?”

**Basic Text, p. 37**

&#x200B;

Our spiritual condition is never static; if  it’s not growing, it’s decaying.  If we stand still, our spiritual  progress will lose its upward momentum.  Gradually, our growth will  slow, then halt, then reverse itself.  Our tolerance will wear thin; our  willingness to serve others will wane; our minds will narrow and  close.  Before long, we’ll be right back where we started: in conflict  with everyone and everything around us, unable to bear even ourselves.

Our only option is to actively participate in  our program of spiritual growth.  We pray, seeking knowledge greater  than our own from a Power greater than ourselves.  We open our minds and  keep them open, becoming teachable and taking advantage of what others  have to share with us.  We demonstrate our willingness to try new ideas  and new ways of doing things, experiencing life in a whole new way.  Our  spiritual progress picks up speed and momentum, driven by the Higher  Power we are coming to understand better each day.

Up or down—it’s one or the other, with very  little in between, where spiritual growth is concerned.  Recovery is not  fueled by wishing and dreaming, we’ve discovered, but by prayer and  action.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  The only constant in my  spiritual condition is change.  I cannot rely on yesterday’s program.   Today, I seek new spiritual growth through prayer and action.

&#x200B;

Have you ever approached a recovery  celebration with the feeling that you should be further along in your  recovery than you are?  Maybe you have listened to newcomers sharing in  meetings, members with much less clean time, and thought, “But I’m just  barely beginning to understand what they’re talking about!”

It’s odd that we should come into recovery  thinking that we will feel wonderful right away or no longer have any  difficulty handling life’s twists and turns.  We expect our physical  problems to correct themselves, our thinking to become rational, and a  fully developed spiritual life to manifest itself overnight.  We forget  that we spent years abusing our bodies, numbing our minds, and  suppressing our awareness of a Higher Power.  We cannot undo the damage  in a day.  We can, however, apply the next step, go to the next meeting,  help the next newcomer.  We heal and recover bit by bit—not overnight,  but over time.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  My body will heal a little, my mind will become a little clearer, and my relationship with my Higher Power will strengthen.

Could sure benefit from reading y'all's experience.,"TLDR: Used Adderall for 2 years on and off then daily for 2 months from March-May. Haven't used it often since. Have almost no effect when using it now so decided to stop using it entirely. Having depressed mood and feeling a pit of despair in my stomach. How was you guys' experience when you stopped using Adderall, and how long did it take to get back to normal?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So I'm in medical school, 3rd year. My first year of med school I got an ADHD diagnosis, not adult onset; I've always had trouble focusing but it never got in the way of me doing relatively well in school until med school due to the increased rigor. And I have always hated studying, like a lot. I love learning but the actual act of studying has always been such a drag for me. So anyhow, I used my Adderall as prescribed on and off for about two years but then I took it daily for 2 months as I studied for my board exam in May. Since my exam, I've taken Adderall here and there but not nearly as much as when I was studying for boards.

When I first got my script, 20mg Adderall would literally make me feel amazing. Like the level of euphoria was insane and I knew right off the bat that I need to be careful with this stuff. It would make me focus for sure but I would also feel so happy and talkative and quite frankly it was amazing. I no longer hated studying when I first started taking Adderall.

That feeling of euphoria faded away as time went on and I was left with Adderall doing exactly what it should: help me focus. Whereas before Adderall would make me feel cracked out and want to study, I began noticing that I had to motivate myself to get up and study after taking Adderall. The extrinsic motivation it provided me was no longer present but it did increase my focus once I began studying.

Then during my 2 month study sesh for board exam, I was taking 60-90mg daily (I am RXed 60mg daily, some days I would just need a boost). I noticed it did less and less for me, and tolerance was expected but like it was excessively ineffective. I recall taking 30mg XR once and falling asleep 90 minutes later. My focus wasn't even that much better. It just made me feel so shitty and I couldn't wait to take my exam and stop using Adderall.

Since my exam in May, I've used it every now and then but even after not using it for a week and taking a 30mg, it still barely does anything for me. The tolerance I've developed has pushed me to decide I want to stop using Adderall because I feel I am edging dangerously close to dependency.

I use it much much less now, but I have some symptoms I wanted to come to this community about.

In the past, using Adderall for a few days and then taking a day break would have me feeling down. I know that's pretty normal. But lately, I have been feeling super down at times. When I am around people I feel fine and I genuinely enjoy it, but when I go home, I feel just a gnawing pit of discomfort, unhappiness and a bit of anxiety. This feeling typically peaks in the afternoon, and it doesn't happen all the time, but it's so uncomfortable and stressful that I just don't know what to do. The other day I was walking to the bathroom and just started crying for no reason whatsoever. Nothing was on my mind that could have triggered it, it was the most random thing. I've noticed becoming reluctant to go to sleep as well, almost as if I dread it. My energy level has been rather low as well.

Though I've substantially cut down on Adderall, I never ever feel myself wanting to take it. Even at the height of the feelings of despair I get, the thought of taking Adderall to subside the feelings has never crossed my mind. And because I never crave Adderall, I never thought to attribute the feelings I have to Adderall withdrawal. But upon reading some Redditor's accounts of Adderall withdrawal, I've come to find that the feelings I've been having are in line with what other people experience after discontinuing Adderall following a period of extended usage.

So I wanted to ask the people who have used Adderall for extended periods of time and then quit taking it, whether it was RXed to you or not, what was your experience? Would you say the experiences I've been having are in line with Adderall withdrawal? How long did it take you to get back to feeling yourself, if going back to your normal self is even possible?

&#x200B;

The worst parts of my life were rooted in my problematic relationships - what I later came to understand as codependency developed from a fawn response of CPTSD. I had already been in therapy for at least a decade before then and on medication to manage my emotional dysregulation among other symptoms. I also came to understand that I had substance use issues that I also needed to tackle. That I was self medicating with mostly weed but also alcohol to cope with my codependency.

I walked into the rooms of Codependents Anonymous and felt seen, heard, accepted, and welcomed. But I wanted to find psych meds to use to help with my mental health symptoms instead of using weed and alcohol. So I went to a doctor and explained to her that I was already in a 12 step and just needed better psych meds. They told me they wouldn't give me meds unless I completed an intensive outpatient program, so as much as I didn't want to, I did what was suggested and entered the program.

The way that I look at and see it now, I basically drank the kool aid from that IOP. I did everything they told me to. They told me I was an addict and so I said ""okay"". I joined AA, I went to tons of meetings, worked the steps, had a sponsor, and was the only person to graduate the program sober. But my relationship with AA was getting wary. The AA culture of the city that I was in was *very* serious. For instance, I signed up to make coffee for a couple different meetings to get more involved, but what I didn't know when I signed up for them was that I was expected to arrive over an hour and a half early for the meeting to make the coffee. If I ever arrived late I was chewed out over it. Then I saw a significant amount of hypocrisy from people in these rooms too and I felt very frustrated, angry, and resentful. All of that and amongst other things led me to decide to step away from AA and thought I could use again and be fine.

I *used* to say that I ""relapsed"" but now I don't think that's what I really did. I just had a few slip ups and realized that at that time in my life I couldn't moderate. But I went back to AA, told them I ""relapsed"" and was willing to try the program again. For a lot of different reasons, mainly because this happened at the start of the pandemic, I was not really welcomed back with open arms. I tried to get close again to the people I was close to before but it wasn't the same. I was going to be moving to a new state/city for grad school and I wanted to say goodbye to my AA friends before leaving, but when I tried to reach out to them to arrange a time to meet they ALL went silent.

So in my new state/city I dove into the local CoDA group and sort of got back into AA but was very hesitant. I did find a new AA sponsor to rework the steps with who I'm still very close with. Because this was all at the height of the pandemic I was attending all my meetings on zoom and at one point was even going to over 8 meetings a week. But all the meetings in the world couldn't stop me from unraveling due to mental health issues going unaddressed and I ended up having to withdrawal from school and check myself into an inpatient psych facility. But I did have a lot of support. I spent a couple of months back home with my family to regroup and then returned to my new state/city.

I ended up taking on more responsibility in my CoDA group, as I'm their literature person and I chair meetings VERY frequently. I still wasn't too keen on AA but I'd pop into the occasional meeting here and there, and was still doing step work with my sponsor. And that's the thing too, is I have a wonderful AA sponsor and CoDA sponsor who I really care for and help me a lot. I'm still working the steps in both programs with both of them. BUT, for almost 2 and a half years I've been going to at least 2 meetings every week and I am *e x h a u s t e d*.

Honestly for a lot of my recovery I've *fully* identified as an **addict**. As a **person in recovery**. And not much else. I have been so dedicated to my programs because that's what I've always seen from other people, that their life is the program. Life without the program is not a thing. And that if I were to live my life without these programs I would fall apart. Because at my core I'm a **damaged addict with a spiritual malady.** This is what these programs have been telling me for the last 2 and a half years.

Frankly, I want to toss out the kool aid. I don't feel like I'm really addict. Did I have a period of my life where I had addict tendencies and substance abuse issues? Yes. But does that make me a full blown addict? I don't actually think so. And I'm torn because these programs *have* done a lot for me. Working the steps *have* treated my substance abuse issues. They have helped me in so many ways change my life 180 degrees and I'm so thankful to what they've done for me. But I just wonder like who am I if my life didn't revolve around these programs? There was a time recently where I started sort of thinking fondly about when I was using so I was like, oh I guess I need to get back into AA, but after a few weeks of adding AA meetings onto my weekly schedule I'm getting really burnt out again. And it's like what I'm hearing at these meetings doesn't really do anything for me anymore. Like I wonder if my thoughts about using would have gone away without going to AA, because I think that's entirely possible.

I still want to work the steps, and I still want to be close with the people I've met in these meetings, but at the same time almost all of my friends are people I've met through these programs. I just want to know who I am if I'm not in 12 steps, and if my life didn't revolve around so many meetings. Like am I really an *addict*? Or was I a codependent person using drugs to self medicate who doesn't need to be dependent on those kinds of things anymore. I just feel myself really starting to pull away from these types of programs and I just don't know what to make of it.

\*\*Edit: I have no desire to use or drink at all. My desire to distance from the programs is not based on anything related to that. I am also properly medicated for the first time in my life and in therapy still. I am also trying to find ways to branch out and meet new people other than recovery groups but it's difficult because I don't have a bunch of free time because of my meetings",13,2

I am doing this.,"My best friend of over 20 years was staying with me for the week and the plan was we would party together while she was here  on vacation. This has been the standard for our friendship for decades. Lots of drinking, going out, etc. 

A couple days in, however, I noticed that she has developed a drinking problem. She was consuming low alcohol seltzer’s (5 percent) throughout the day along with eliminating two bottle of whiskey over the course of about 6 days. This was in addition to the usual amount of drinking she and I were doing at dinner and bars.

I had a hard time keeping up with her on the first night but I definitely was getting drunk with her every night. On Wednesday I talked with my life coach about stopping drinking for thirty days as it’s been on my mind even before my friends visit. I confessed to her that I’ve been getting drunk on gin every night (this is following my usual beer/wine drinking at dinner) 

I told her I would start my 30 days after my friend left. I guess I felt like I was being rude or would hurt her feelings or something if I stopped drinking with her? 🥴 

My coach talked  me into starting my day 1 right then and there. 

I was hit with night sweats, insomnia and leg cramps the first night without alcohol . But I woke up feeling clear headed in ways I have not felt for years. 

I am now beginning my fourth day of not drinking on a daily basis in many years. I am planning on sticking with this for 30 days but I am hopeful it will go longer. 

Im really scared for my friend though. I think she is in way deeper than I was. 

Thanks for letting me share and be part of this community. I really didn’t think I had drinking problem but I was on my way to some serious problems for sure.",16,0

**Basic Text, p. 11**

&#x200B;

Most of us come to the program with a multitude  of self-imposed limitations that prevent us from realizing our full  potential, limitations that impede our attempts to find the values that  lie at the core of our being.  We place limitations on our ability to be  true to ourselves, limitations on our ability to function at work,  limitations on the risks we’re willing to take—the list seems endless.   If our parents or teachers told us we would never succeed, and we  believed them, chances are we didn’t achieve much.  If our socialization  taught us not to stand up for ourselves, we didn’t, even if everything  inside us was screaming to do so.

In Narcotics Anonymous, we are given a process  by which we can recognize these false limitations for what they are.   Through our Fourth Step, we’ll discover that we don’t want to keep all  the rules we’ve been taught.  We don’t have to be the lifelong victims  of past experiences.  We are free to discard the ideas that inhibit our  growth.  We are capable of stretching our boundaries to encompass new  ideas and new experiences.  We are free to laugh, to cry, and, above  all, to enjoy our recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will let go of my self-imposed limitations and open my mind to new ideas.

Tons of medical tests from MRIs and EEGs to blood work have shown nothing out of the ordinary.

I haven't used MDMA since. One by one, I dropped the rest of my vices, down to caffeine, which I have stopped completely 8 months ago. Weed was a year ago, alcohol 1.5 years. 

I keep getting worse. I'm so light sensitive now, outside is not an option without sunglasses even if it's overcast. I have no memory of what happened a week ago, I feel nothing, miss nobody, and my personality is like a half-memory of a person I met in a dream and try to maintain the general vibe of. I constantly feel full of shit when I talk to people because my recall doesn't exist and I'm never sure. 

I used to think practices in medical fields could only be established when treatment mechanisms were clear and figured out. Boy was I naive. SSRIs have been around for 34 years and nobody still knows how they actually work, who needs what kind, why they stop working sometimes, or never begin to help in the first place. Still widely prescribed.

I'm not doing anything psychoactive anymore, but there was not a single fucking day when I felt like I'm getting better. Exercise, sleep and diet feel like meaningless chores that just make me more exhausted instead of bringing improvement.

**Basic Text, pp. 106-107**

&#x200B;

Most of us arrived in Narcotics Anonymous with a  very poor ability to listen.  But to take full advantage of “the  therapeutic value of one addict helping another,” we must learn to  listen actively.

What is active listening for us?  In meetings, it means we concentrate on what the speaker is sharing, *while* the  speaker is sharing.  We set aside our own thoughts and opinions until  the meeting is over.  That’s when we sort through what we’ve heard to  decide which ideas we want to use and which we want to explore further.

We can apply our active listening skills in  sponsorship, too.  Newcomers often talk with us about some “major event”  in their lives.  While such events may not seem significant to us, they  are to the newcomer who has little experience living life on life’s  terms.  Our active listening helps us empathize with the feelings such  events trigger in our sponsee’s life.  With that understanding, we have a  better idea of what to share with them.

The ability to listen actively was unknown to  us in the isolation of our addiction.  Today, this ability helps us  actively engage with our recovery.  Through active listening, we receive  everything being offered us in NA, and we share fully with others the  love and care we’ve been given.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will strive to be an active listener.  I will practice active listening when others share and when I share with others.

I also take 2mg Suboxone here and there when the pain meds aren’t cutting it for pain. Sometimes Ambien. Sometimes Valium. I feel like benzos actually help calm me and the chaos in my mind.

We learn that if we pray regularly, we won’t be hurting as often or as intensely.”*

**Basic Text, p. 45**

&#x200B;

Regular prayer and meditation are two more key  elements in our new pattern of living.  Our active addiction was more  than just a bad habit waiting to be broken by force of will.  Our  addiction was a negative, draining dependence that stole all our  positive energy.  That dependence was so total, it prevented us from  developing any kind of reliance on a Higher Power.

From the very beginning of our recovery, our  Higher Power has been the force that’s brought us freedom.  First, it  relieved us of our compulsion to keep taking drugs, even when we knew  they were killing us.  Then, it gave us freedom from the more deeply  ingrained aspects of our disease.  Our Higher Power gave us the  direction, the strength, and the courage to inventory ourselves; to  admit out loud to another person what our lives had been like, perhaps  for the first time; to begin seeking release from the chronic defects of  character underlying our troubles; and, at last, to make amends for the  wrongs we’d done.

That first contact with a Higher Power, and  that first freedom, has grown into a life full of freedom.  We maintain  that freedom by maintaining and improving our conscious contact with our  Higher Power through regular prayer and meditation.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will make a commitment to include regular prayer and meditation in my new pattern of living.

I need some advice or information here and I didn't know where else to turn. So, mods please forgive me if this goes against the rules.

Yes, I am an addict. I have been in recovery since 2003. My biggest drug of choice has been alcohol, but I was also taking fairly large doses a variety of benzos for a while. And I did inhalants for a bit.

I am no stranger to recovery or addiction. I move along one day at a time and I once had 13 years under my belt before I relapsed and fell harder into it all than I was before I got sober. It cost me jobs, relationships and my marriage - but I guess that last one might not be such a bad thing to have lost as I found the love of my life after, but I digress.

I have never done cocaine or heroin. I was wondering if someone who has done those drugs can tell me what it feels like and describe the highs and lows for me. That is if you are comfortable talking about them.  What would you do, how did you cope if you were addicted, what are some things you did when you were high?

First of all its not be whos the addict its my sister, the long story short of it is its meth, shes a pig on it literally could smoke a 700/1000 worth a day easy if not more.

&#x200B;

This has been going on for 10 years however I think the outright pig behaviour on it has been the last 3 years.

&#x200B;

During the last 10 years shes abandoned kids 5 times, once with her girls, 4 times with her boy whose now with the Dad.

&#x200B;

Prior to this post she was doing good, 8 months clean, she was on some  meds to balance her out/help her sleep wasn't perfect but she was on the right track, seeing her boy every school holidays, talking to him every 2nd/3rd day on the phone the whole plan was the Dad and the boy to come back where we were next year.

&#x200B;

Then when someone got out of prison who she knew had unlimited supply of crack, it was over. Gone,

&#x200B;

I managed to take her phone off her briefly and she legit didn't even try, like a light switch almost. The 8months of recovery didn't matter, the sleep affirmations she put herself through the viguous exercise everything.  Just out the window the moment this guy made contact, and whats sad as we had the kid during the holidays when he first did.

&#x200B;

Over the period of a week I was livid with the whole thing, in hindsight maybe a different approach may of worked but its hard to keep calm when you read shit on her phone such as ""I'm choosing you over my sons happiness"" this was after she had a dabble of course.

&#x200B;

But there are times I thought I would of got through, to no avail, shes gone now gave her the ultimatum to go if thats what she wants, and sure enough, she did.

&#x200B;

Speaking to a councellor, she told me that it sounds like shes not 'there' yet, if she ever gets there that is. Shes been run over, over dosed, been part of a high speed crash. Is this one of those cases where there is just no saving someone like this? Shes screwed that part of the brain to the point of no return?

&#x200B;

I dunno. I kinda always picked up on her slipping past month mentallty but anytime I wanted to address it no matter which way I go about it, its always with the response of "" I don't wanna talk about it"" and shooting the argument down.

&#x200B;

Sorry if this is a downer for you guys in recovery, but yeh its eating me up more so the fact the 3 times he left my nephew it wasn't so bad as he was young, this time though. Even ringing him today and anticipating him to ask to speak to his Mum tears my fucken heart out I'm an emotional wreck as the Dad ain't much better, hes a controlled user I guess to a lesser degree but before all this I helped raise him and practically did solo for 2 years I treat him like my own.",2,0

I don't want to blame anyone but myself, but at the same time I feel like my boundaries were crossed.

A friend contacted me out of the blue from a new number. I was excited to hear from her because it was eight months of not knowing how she is doing, or if she is even alive. She wanted to get together for dinner to catch up, and I was down. I was busy studying for my finals, so I ask what her plans were for the upcoming week. She pushes that we see each other next day, and that it would be okay because it would just be ""for dinner"" and we only meet for an hour. I didn't know why she had to push for the next day, but I wanted to have a couple drinks and discuss things that have been going on in life.


Two or three drinks into dinner, I told her how I haven't been partying anymore. She says the same except for the previous weekend. I mention to her how it's been two months for me and I am trying to keep it up because I have a lot to lose in my life right now. It seems like immediately afterwards she is talking about wanting to get cocaine after dinner. I try to tell her that it's good to hangout and not do it so we can build new associations with each other. I try telling her to just focus on the next day, or I give her suggestions of other things we can go do instead.

I offer to get an Uber for us because I hate the idea of drunk driving but she refuses. I should have just Ubered myself home because she ends up driving to her dealer's house even though I thought we weren't going to go.

She confessed that the only reason why she hit me up and needed to see me the next day was because she was trying to get me to re-home her cat. I know it seems like the obvious thing that I need to do is cut her out of my life. But it is difficult because there are a lot of other attributes that I valued in this person and I don't want to hurt her.

*Only reason for taking this amount of Xanax is because I run out of Kratom and used Tramadol for maintenance until Kratom arrives. Tramadol is notorious for causing seizures, I had one on it in the past, so I needed to combine it with a benzo to be seizure-proof.*

It’s easy to be grateful when everything runs  smoothly.  If we get a raise at work, we’re grateful.  If we get  married, we’re grateful.  If someone surprises us with a nice present or  an unasked favor, we’re grateful.  But if we get fired, divorced, or  disappointed, gratitude flies out the window.  We find ourselves  becoming obsessed with the things that are wrong, even though everything  else may be wonderful.

This is where we can use a gratitude list.  We  sit down with a pen and paper and list the people for whom we are  grateful.  We all have people who’ve supported us through life’s  upheavals.  We list the spiritual assets we have attained, for we know  we could never make it through our present circumstances without them.   Last, but not least, we list our recovery itself.  Whatever we have that  we are grateful for goes on the list.

We’re sure to find that we have literally  hundreds of things in our lives that inspire our gratitude.  Even those  of us who are suffering from an illness or who have lost all material  wealth will find blessings of a spiritual nature for which we can be  thankful.  An awakening of the spirit is the most valuable gift an  addict can receive.

**Just for today:**  I will write a list of things, both material and spiritual, for which I am grateful.

I used to smoke a lot of weed, like several times a day every day. When I started on my career I had to quit, so I switched to synthetic so I could pass a drug test and still be able to get high. I ended up being hooked on it for the better part of three years. Those years are pretty much a blur in hindsight. It got to the point where I was spending every dime that didn't go to gas, food, and basic bills on spice. My favorite blend/brand was called scooby snacks. I'm not proud of it but on occasion I even stole to be able to buy it. Eventually I got busted, and I had enough misdemeanor theft charges that the judge could've rolled it into a felony if he'd been so inclined. Thankfully that didn't happen. A couple of my friends were also addicted to it, one even worse than I was. My dude Mark was addicted to it so badly that he ended up in the hospital at one point when he ran out and couldn't find more. Eventually I had the opportunity to move out of state and away from my sources, and I took it. The part of me that knew I had a problem also knew I'd never quit unless I distanced myself from where I was getting it. I did manage to quit it with the help of my ex but the withdrawal from that shit was the worst physical experience of my life. Spent a straight week in bed wishing I'd die. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I felt freezing cold but I was sweating like crazy at the same time. That shit was marketed as a synthetic weed alternative but it turned out to be extremely addictive. I almost ruined my life with that shit. I got over it and moved on, it was many years ago now that I quit it (2014), but that was an absolutely miserable experience and definitely one of the darkest times in my life.

Some of us came to Narcotics Anonymous  impoverished by our disease.  Everything we’d owned had been lost to our  addiction.  Once we got clean, we put all our energy into recovering  our material possessions, only to feel even more dissatisfied with our  lives than before.

Other members have sought to ease their  emotional pain with material things.  A potential date has rejected us?   Let’s buy something.  The dog has died?  Let’s go to the mall.  Problem  is, emotional fulfillment can’t be bought, not even on an easy  installment plan.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with material  things.  They can make life more convenient or more luxurious, but they  can’t fix us.  Where, then, can true joy be found?  We know; the answer  is within ourselves.

When have we found joy?  When we’ve offered  ourselves in service to others, without expectation of reward.  We’ve  found true warmth in the fellowship of others—not only in NA, but in our  families, our relationships, and our communities.  And we’ve found the  surest source of satisfaction in our conscious contact with our God.   Inner peace, a sure sense of direction, and emotional security do not  come from material things, but from within.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  True joy can’t be bought.  I will seek my joy in service, in fellowship, in my Higher Power—I will seek within.

I went to rehab a little over a month ago that was a “duel diagnosis center” and it turned out to be a joke. The program itself was actually awesome, just not at all what it was presented as on the phone to me. I was told I’d see a psychiatrist, my therapist twice a week.. Stayed the 30 days and saw my therapist once, and my psychiatrist couldn’t remember which client he was talking to so my meds were super inconsistent. I figured no big deal, it was mainly just detox and it was a beautiful place for it. Plus I knew it wasn’t long term so the hope was to get into a really good duel diagnosis IOP and go from there. So I’m now a week into my iop and asked about the psychiatrist I was told about on the phone. I was told there is no psychiatrist here at all.. Oh also they are down a therapist so that’s not an option in program either. So I talked with my caseworker today and asked for help finding a therapist and psychiatrist because I’m in a new city and thought maybe she’d have an idea of who’s good. She had awesome ideas but said I’m going to have to wait until the end of IOP because I’m not going to be able to get an apt because the hours of my current program would conflict. So now here I am, new city, sober for the first time since I was very young with no help dealing with all these fucking feelings I haven’t had to deal with since I was literally about 12. My mental health is deteriorating quickly and I don’t know what to do. I took myself off the bipolar meds I was prescribed while I was at rehab because I couldnt take them consistently while I was there and that was worse than being completely unmedicated. I thought it would be nbd because I’d be at a new place soon, but there is nobody here to help. I’m bipolar and depressed as shit and I’m literally afraid of my own thoughts. Wtf do I even do now. I can’t use because I’ll be kicked out of program and sober living, but at the same time I’d get these thoughts to stop that are trying to kill me.

**Basic Text, p. 105**

&#x200B;

Addiction shaped our thoughts in its own way.   Whatever their shape may once have been, they became misshapen once our  disease took full sway over our lives.  Our obsession with drugs and  self molded our moods, our actions, and the very shape of our lives.

Each of the spiritual ideals of our program  serves to straighten out one or another of the kinks in our thinking  that developed in our active addiction.  Denial is counteracted by  admission, secretiveness by honesty, isolation by fellowship, and  despair by faith in a loving Higher Power.  The spiritual ideals we find  in recovery are restoring the shape of our thoughts and our lives to  their natural condition.

And what is that “natural condition”?  It is  the condition we truly seek for ourselves, a reflection of our highest  dreams.  How do we know this?  Because our thoughts are being shaped in  recovery by the spiritual ideals we find in our developing relationship  with the God we’ve come to understand in NA.

No longer does addiction shape our thoughts.  Today, our lives are being shaped by our recovery and our Higher Power.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will allow spiritual ideals to shape my thoughts.  In that design, I will find the shape of my own Higher Power.

With this post I truly acknowledge that I am now probably a redditor in Recovery as well. My story of drug abuse is rather short though.   
I am a 23 year old university student who has just finished his Bachelor degree of Social Law in Europe. I have never tried Cannabis and have only used MDMA a few times around two years ago, and hadnt used it for over 1 / 2 years now. Because my University set 9 exams into one week I was under one hell of a stress the weeks before that. And in these weeks the first contact with Methamphetamin was made. Another student from another class mentioned that he was able to learn around 12 hours with almost no breaks in between for an exam. Since I am the kind of guy who lets him self constantly be distracted by anyone and anything I thought to myself  ""well... I suppose one little boost in one particular class cant really hurt now can it?"". My first try of the drug wasnt really a success though. I was able to study around 5 hours, but after that I got distracted by my computer games again. I was also pretty sick the next day. A week later (the final week before the exams), I tried a smaller dose a second time. This time it worked perfectly, with around 13 hours of studying done, and I wasnt even sick the next day.  
I always told myself the drug was only supposed to help me study and to finish this hell week of exams, so I dropped it after all work was done. Fast forward two weeks later and the results came in, which were almost perfect grades. So I thought one last consumption of the rest of methamphetmin shouldnt hurt right? Just as a reward for the good results and finally finishing University and getting a degree, right?

What happened was that I took around 250mg of Meth over a span of around 8 hours, which resulted in me being completly drenched in sweet, short double vision, bad working memory, feeling sick, anxious and generally just awful. I suspected that I probably overdosed, or was pretty close to an overdose, and even called the paramedics the next day, because I felt numb in my whole body, had a tingeling sensation in all limbs, could barely speek and had a pulse of 170. They found no arrhythmia and all basic cognitive functions were fine, so they just told me to sit it out and left again. 

Now almost 72 hours after the last consumption I still can barely sleep, feel depressed as hell, cant concentrate on anything, my eyes are dry and hurt, I have no appetite, I am almost constantly short of breath and my pulse skyrockets when I even think about going more than 3 steps. Though I have no drug cravings (yet), I have reason to believe my brain got a tad fried from the meth and is either damaged, or was/is dependent on meth or something in between. 

My goal is to 100% fix myself from the situation I am in. But I admit the withdrawal symptoms are really getting on my psyche. Like its not even the tiredness or depression that is killing me, but the fact that I cant really sleep, that my I am out of breath all the time and that my working memory and concentration are almost completly annihlated. All these physical symptoms are producing an anxiety that is always in the back of my mind that this mindset and symptoms are going to be there for ever, and that my brain was literally cooked from the inside out. 

I couldnt get new meth even if I wanted to, since I destroyed all leftovers yesterday and moved back to my parents to recover.   


Though I really hope that the symptoms are going to lessen soon. Nobody knows as of yet of my drug abuse, but if I still feel horrible like this, I am considering seeking clinical help, but I´ll try to keep that as a last resort if the depression and or insomnia becomes unbearable. 

Lets see how my future way is gonna look.",12,0

**Basic Text, p. 33**

&#x200B;

We’ve heard it said that “we’re as sick as our secrets.”  What do we keep secret, and why?

We keep secret those things that cause us  shame.  We may hold onto such things because we don’t want to surrender  them.  Yet if they’re causing us shame, wouldn’t we live more easily  with ourselves if we were rid of them?

Some of us hold onto the things that cause us shame for another reason.  It’s not that we don’t *want* to be rid of them; we just don’t believe we *can* be  rid of them.  They’ve plagued us for so long, and we’ve tried so many  times to rid ourselves of them, that we’ve stopped hoping for relief.   Yet still they shame us, and still we keep them secret.

We need to remember who we are: recovering  addicts.  We who tried so long to keep our drug use a secret have found  freedom from the obsession and compulsion to use.  Though many of us  enjoyed using right to the end, we sought recovery anyway.  We just  couldn’t stand the toll our using was taking on us.  When we admitted  our powerlessness and sought help from others, the burden of our secret  was lifted from us.

The same principle applies to whatever secrets  may burden us.  Yes, we’re as sick as our secrets.  Only when our  secrets stop being secret can we begin to find relief from those things  that cause us shame.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  My secrets can make me sick only as long as they stay secret.  Today, I will talk with my sponsor about my secrets.

Her life seems to be a day to day struggle to avoid physical withdrawal symptoms that can lead to her being totally debilitated from seizures at the extreme. Nearly everyone in her life is also a drug addict. 

I felt a genuine connection with her and the day we met we talked together for nearly 12 hours. She had to use several times during that period in order to remain functional enough for us to talk. We talked about philosophy and politics and life in general and she was very open about her past. We’ve remained in touch by email but I haven’t seen her since that first time we met last week. She is living a pretty chaotic lifestyle right now. 

I want to do something to help her but I’m not sure what would be the best approach. Does anyone have any advice on things I should do or avoid doing? She’s someone who I would like to remain connected with but I realize that could be difficult to navigate because of her situation.",3,0

Every prescription I’ve misused was prescribed for a legitimate reason and I had always intended to use them properly, but it always got out of hand when I was under emotional stress. 

I take ambien for insomnia, and have taken (and abused) several prescription stimulants and benzodiazepines. 

I’ve taken the ambien for over 10 years and taken too many per night, always running out long before I should. The other meds came in about 6 years ago when I was struggling to finish college and trying to juggle a lot more than I could handle. It all got way out of hand within a few years and I thought my health was permanently gone and life was over. 

Then, in 2018, I found out I was pregnant. I quit everything immediately. For 9 months I took the best care of my body than I had in many years because it wasn’t just “my” body anymore.  Once my baby was born things slowly started to slip. 

I occasionally would take an extra ambien to fall back asleep after nighttime wakings. Then I needed 1.5 pills to fall asleep. Eventually I was running out early again. 

This time last year I reasoned in my head that I should add a benzodiazepine back into the mix (huge mistake, obviously). Early this year I decided that I needed a stimulant again and told myself that I’d only use small doses a couple times a month to stay on top of things. After all, they did send me sailing through college with a 4.0, right?

Long story short- my brain, physical appearance and health have deteriorated quickly over the past several months and I crave the stimulants.  There was even an incident where I had all the symptoms of a mild heart attack. 

I had about half a bottle each of dextroamphetamine spansules and Xanax that I trashed a couple days ago. I also threw out several cute pill containers and baggies I had which I realized were glossing over a drug addiction and making it seem okay and even fun. 

I have only been able to make it up to 2 weeks without stimulants for about 4 months now. I took them 3 days ago. I know I’m going to get strong cravings in the next few weeks. I wholeheartedly believe these drugs are slowly killing me and robbing my baby of his mother. 

I guess I’m writing this to hold myself accountable when I say I am stopping this now.",8,0

This past year has been rough but is continually getting so much better. I am celebrating one year clean. A year ago today I was homeless and strung out hoping each day would be my last. Today I have a great job a roof over my head and a few people who care about me and my sobriety. I never thought I would make it out of my addiction alive let alone become a decent member of society. Any way I don’t have many to share this with so I thought I’d share here and give anyone new in recovery some hope that it does get better and there is life outside of addiction. If your struggling reach out and know it’s never too late. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve tried it’s still possible.,115,0

**Basic Text, p. 84**

&#x200B;

Trusting people is a risk.  Human beings are  notoriously forgetful, unreliable, and imperfect.  Most of us come from  backgrounds where betrayal and insensitivity among friends were common  occurrences.  Even our most reliable friends weren’t very reliable.  By  the time we arrive at the doors of NA, most of us have hundreds of  experiences bearing out our conviction that people are untrustworthy.   Yet our recovery demands that we trust people.  We are faced with this  dilemma:  People are not always trustworthy, yet we must trust them.   How do we do that, given the evidence of our pasts?

First, we remind ourselves that the rules of  active addiction don’t apply in recovery.  Most of our fellow members  are doing their level best to live by the spiritual principles we learn  in the program.  Second, we remind ourselves that we aren’t 100%  reliable, either.  We will surely disappoint someone in our lives, no  matter how hard we try not to.  Third, and most importantly, we realize  that we *need* to trust our fellow members of NA.  Our lives are at  stake, and the only way we can stay clean is to trust these  well-intentioned folks who, admittedly, aren’t perfect.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will trust my fellow members.  Though certainly not perfect, they are my best hope.

Reset after reset on my sobriety counter. Time after time of ""this is the last time"". Today, I say no more.

I was on my way to use tonight when, after kissing my mom goodnight, she sent me a text ending with ""You are my heart."" Then it was like the universe tried to send as many possible alarm bells at once as possible.

A meaningful song that I relate to with my addiction auto played right after I read ""my heart"", the current time was my lucky numbers, too much to tell here, but everywhere I looked I saw things meaningful to me screaming LOUDLY at me to stop.

The universe has sent me so many warnings and I have faced the repercussions of living hell every single damn time. I ignore the alarms, relapse anyway, and pay the price dearly.

I just finished watching the movie ""Four Good Days"". It hollowed me to my core seeing the mother be so similar on many levels to my mom. I was almost a month clean until 3 days ago. 4 years clean when I relapsed in May. I've relapsed at least 9 times since May. Not a single person in my life knows. I don't have anyone I can tell without devastating them to their core.

I will NOT lose the unwavering trust and unfaltering love from my mother.

Meth has taken away moments in my life that were priceless. Meth is insidious and pervasive. I was a straight a and b student, an honor student. I was the poster boy for the anti drug campaign and yet how far I have fallen. If meth can destroy my life, I promise it can destroy yours too.

Today I say no more. No more. God willing, no more.

It's always harder to quit drinking when I don't want to, but I've put my big boy pants on & admitted I need to and it feels like this time it's going to stick. 

Been to a few AA meetings which were much more helpful than I anticipated and I do recommend giving them a chance, however being a traveller means I don't really put down roots in any groups, most of my relationships are pretty cometary in nature. Suggestions for online meetings very welcome, but while it's nice to spend some time with people who genuinely understand it's not absolutely vital to me. I'm mostly just tired of waking up drunk with The Shame lingering, and always being in a lot of pain because I'm carrying too much fat for my chronically-ill joints to carry and not enough muscle to support them in their attempts. 

Sobriety is hard but it leaves me sharper and more able to contribute to relationships, projects, solutions. I have more motivation and better ability to put knowledge and skills to use.",45,0

**Basic Text, p. 85**

&#x200B;

Many of us try to wiggle out of a difficult  spot by being dishonest, only to have to humble ourselves later and tell  the truth.  Some of us twist our stories as a matter of course, even  when we could just as easily tell the plain truth.  Every time we try to  avoid being honest, it backfires on us.  Honesty may be uncomfortable,  but the trouble we have to endure when we are dishonest is usually far  worse than the discomfort of telling the truth.

Honesty is one of the fundamental principles of  recovery.  We apply this principle right from the beginning of our  recovery, when we finally admit our powerlessness and unmanageability.   We continue to apply the principle of honesty each time we are faced  with the option of either living in fantasy or living life on its own  terms.  Learning to be honest isn’t always easy, especially after the  covering up and deception so many of us practiced in our addiction.  Our  voices may shake as we test our newfound honesty.  But before long, the  sound of the truth coming from our own mouths settles any doubts:   Honesty feels good!  It’s easier living the truth than living a lie.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I will honestly embrace  life, with all its pressures and demands.  I will practice honesty,  even when it is awkward to do so.  Honesty will help, not hurt, my  efforts to live clean and recover.

**Basic Text, p. 7**

&#x200B;

Guilt is one of the most commonly encountered  stumbling blocks in recovery.  One of the more notorious forms of guilt  is the self-loathing that results when we try to forgive ourselves but  don’t feel forgiven.

How can we forgive ourselves so we *feel* it?   First, we remember that guilt and failure are not links in an  unbreakable chain.  Honestly sharing with a sponsor and with other  addicts shows this to be true.  Often the result of such sharing is a  more sensible awareness of the part we ourselves have played in our  affairs.  Sometimes we realize that our expectations have been too  high.  We increase our willingness to participate in the solutions  rather than dwelling on the problems.

Somewhere along the way, we discover who we  really are.  We usually find that we are neither the totally perfect nor  the totally imperfect beings we have imagined ourselves to be.  We need  not live up to or down to our illusions; we need only live in reality.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I am grateful for my  assets and accept my liabilities.  Through willingness and humility, I  am freed to progress in my recovery and achieve freedom from guilt.
