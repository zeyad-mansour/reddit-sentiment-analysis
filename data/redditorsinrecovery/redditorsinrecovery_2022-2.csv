2022-02-22 19:26:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/sz32ms/side_effects_from_getting_sober/,Side Effects from Getting Sober,"Historically, I’ve relied primarily on alcohol and accompanying Cannabis for managing stress.  Clearly, this isn’t healthy, and I’ve always sort of known this in the back of my mind.  I always had an excuse for how I wasn’t as bad as some other stoner or heavy drinker I knew, and so I always was able to justify it away under that justification.  Recently though, I’ve made a commitment to kicking both habits and learning to deal with my stress and emotions in healthier ways.  Going on about three weeks which isn't long in the grand of scheme of things, but it's a start.

What I’m finding isn’t what I expected though.  I anticipated I’d need to deal with the stress of the here and now.  The ""Today"".  The things that I drank or smoked in excess to deal with.  I never really considered how much old stressors, negative emotions, and past things I shoveled aside and just swallowed would come up to surface again.  I could rattle off off a laundry list of suppressed emotions, pushed-aside problems, ignored feelings, and so on.  

Taking the blinders off, I am a little horrified at what I’ve not dealt with and that needs to be done, said, and handled.  It’s overwhelming, and I know it shows to others around me.  I have a lot less energy and motivation to do even the things I enjoy doing.  My “give a damn” factor is pretty low.  I’m staying true to being sober, but I know this is something I want to do and I’d rather not go through this a second or third or nth time if I can help it.

For anyone who’s walked this path before me, how do you get out of this rut?  I’m staring at a mountain of things I’ve ignored for years and the sheer depth of it all and how much I need to untangle and work on is beyond discouraging.  Even the things I enjoy doing are unappealing, things that are good for dealing with stress and handling things (Primarily combat sports like boxing and jiujitsu/wrestling).

I burned my brain on nothing but food, weed, booze and porn, not even LSD worked on me.","Hi everyone. I'm 19. This is a confession of some sort, I guess. I’ve got to tell someone.

I feel like I’ve been an addict all my life. I never felt attached to people, especially kids my age, just to things that made me escape myself. I now feel like a hog with a degree in pure maths, if you see what I mean. A dangerous, big animal moved around by dopamine, seeking for endorphins with knowledge and intelligence he just should not have. I feel that's all I am.

The woman who gave me birth denied me many things as a baby: television, meat, sugar, cow milk, certain toys, and (long story short) my father. At the same time, she also breastfed me until 3 and a half years old (I still remember sucking on her). Guess what that did: all food became just a way to run away. Since the one my mother did give outside of her tits was books, all kinds of information (that is, brain food) too had become a way to run away, ever since learned how to read at 4.  Well, at 11, I found porn.

I still can’t fucking seem to get rid of the compulsion for that shit. I have seen about every kind of filth the human mind can produce just to get some novelty back in my perceptions. Every. I don’t care for stimulants at all, but I’m sure cocaine would be nothing compared to the rush a porn binge session gives me. And it’s not just my guess, I heard this from several people who did both. I spent 4, 5 hours, sometimes entire days watching porn and sexting with without ever hooking up, just for the rush, the excitement.

Add that I have been smoking pot every single day since the age of 14. I smoked straights (with those i’m a pack-a-day man), roll-ups, cigars, pipes, great weed, alright weed, badly kept weed, CBD flower cut with some kind of benzo sold as weed, amazing hash, hash cut with other vegetal resins of some kind, hash cut with petroleum derivatives… at a point I started inhaling the cigars because I just couldn’t feel anything going down my lungs anymore (and soon I stopped feeling that as well, I stopped doing it for that reason alone).  I need it more than anything now. I don’t drink, nor watch porn or overeat, if I don’t have weed. The whole machine breaks down, I can’t do ANYTHING without knowing I’ve got a joint for later. It’s like food and drugs switched places: I usually binge on food, fatty or sugary, once a day to feel some buzz, then completely forget to eat. At the same time I need substances like one would need meals.

Lately the bottle got me, too. It was ok as long as it got me drunk, I drank a beer and that was it. Then, I swear, something happened to my liver the moment I hit 18. From day to day, I couldn’t get drunk no matter what, I swear to god, I got to the point of throwing up without feeling inebriated, and still felt like lighting a cig afterwards. So I kept tring and trying and found out I really do have another kind of love for alcohol I couldn’t appreciate it before: it’s my favorite anxiolitic. I did do xans, tramadol, dihydrocodeine, and plugged straight medical morphine, yet nothing comes close to the warmth of booze for me. I have been drinking every day for the past months and can’t go more than a day without it. 4 alcohol units a day is the bare minimum, but have gone up to as much as 25 and still felt functional, not intoxicated.

The dramatic thing is, I have the lucidity to realize and understand all of this, I think about quitting every day, in fact, it’s mostly all I think about nowadays. I gave up this school year, see less and less my friends, don’t read, don’t watch movies, don’t play my bass anymore (I’ve been playing for years and thought I loved it more than anything else), don’t write, don’t draw, I can only think about feeling numbed. I can’t fucking stop any of these things... I despise them, yet just can’t imagine myself without ‘em, yet say to myself that every time will be the last, and from tomorrow on i will quit. But I really can neither stop, even for a day, nor stop trying to stop, enjoying my drugs for what they are and going on with my day. It’s eating me up in every way. I did LSD 4 times, and it pretty much did nothing to shake me out of this, I had fun for 12 hours and it all came back the way it as before. Pretty cool, but it made me want to anesthetize myself even more. It all feels like a long-term suicide and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to reverse it. The thing is, I just want to feel peace, after all. I can’t ever shake myself out of that mindset, and that was and will always be what dooms me.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7212618}"

Thank you guys for guiding me, it’s insane how few resources there are out there for this!! I am so grateful and want to add my story for others who might also feel lost:

#My story
* I started smoking pot at 18 and just stopped at 30. I smoked to “slow my brain down”, or intentionally handicap myself. I thought this made everyday things more “interesting”. The joke was on me, though, because those everyday things began to feel like mountains I had to deal with daily. Then I stopped dealing. I also have a high-paying job that is very stressful and has many moving parts…and I’ve been a stoner through it all. I would even go so far as to time my tokes a few hours before meetings! DUMB! I began to notice that I was no longer able to juggle all of the moving parts in my head that I needed to for said job, so I quit. It’s worth noting that I don’t partake in any other substances, including alcohol. 

#Withdrawal Experience
Here’s what I experienced: 

* The first day: easy. No withdrawals at all. I thought this was going to be cake. I replaced smoking sessions in the evening with running instead. I ran each day, and I believe it helped.

* Days 2-4: the absolute worst times of my life. I was angry toward everyone and hyper-sensitive. I also could not sleep even with sedatives. Heavy night sweats, and cold all day. I had to take a sick day from work on day 4 after multiple sleepless nights. I felt so defeated and literally fetal baby cried in the corner of my kitchen like a straight up crazy person. I felt so trapped by my addiction. I picked up CBD on day 4 with hopes I could sleep. Super foggy in the head still. Just really questioning all around whether to do this.

* Days 5-6: I finally slept! Somewhat broken sleep, but enough to function okay. I’m not sure if the supplements helped or if it was just time for my body. Cold during the day was replaced with more sweat. I took a second cold shower one day because it was too much.

* Today (Day 7): My body feels overall warmer than usual. My hands are not cold. I can also feel my brain coming back online in small ways. I don’t second guess whether I took my meds, or paid something, etc. I also weighed myself and am now a full 10lb lighter from the daily exercise, better eating (no more couch sugar sessions), and ridiculous sweating over the week.

I've never actually admitted that before. I started drinking ten years ago and using drugs shortly thereafter. Most of this behavior arose from a need to cope with things happening in my life that at the time I did not understand, at least not to the full extent. 

I don't know the day I ""quit"" definitively. My struggle has been completely solitary. Boyfriends, family, coworkers, peers, doctors, no one knows or has ever confronted me. I've used substances and quit countless times all without others knowing around me, or perhaps just not caring. Maybe I am lucky or just really good at hiding it. But now I've come to realize that I've never really ""quit"" in the sense that I've never addressed the root of these problems or been honest with myself about them. Even if the substances aren't there, the cravings are, the mentality is, and the pattern of my life is just going to continue repeating, over and over.

So maybe today is actually ""day one"". I didn't have a dramatic epiphany like a Hollywood drama, just an ever-growing pile of dishes in my sink, trash on my table, and a complete lack of motivation to do anything but distract myself from the voice in the back of my head telling me to drink, telling me to find something to dose. Yesterday I reached something like a recent low point--tearing apart my house because I thought I might have had loose pills somewhere but I didn't. Then I looked at myself like, *fuck, what the hell is wrong with me.* I just sort of realized I can ignore this all I want, pretend I have lasting self-control, and pretend I've never had a problem like the rest of the people around me, but it won't go away. Better do something about it rather than not.

I started by writing my thoughts in a journal and promising myself to be honest, even if it's just between me and myself, and accepting that this is real. Hunting for therapy I can afford has been no small task for an unemployed guy on gov't insurance, but I'm working on it. The other piece is to find some kind of community where I can connect with people in similar situations. Kind of why I ended up here, seeing as I no longer know anyone in my town and no one else I know is sober.

On top of it, i've had my share of traumatic experiences during my childhood which practically forced me to completely skip that phase of my life and basically ""grow up"" way too early. It's like i went from being a child to an adult in the span of a week. I believe that was what kickstarted my mood disorders. 

I don't think i've ever recovered from this. Even my own mother is scared of me because i suddenly go from normal to angry; from smiling to shouting like a maniac. The worst thing about it is that i can't even recall anything i do in this state of mind. It's like blacking out completely and suddenly waking up somewhere else with no recollection of the things you have said and done. 

Drugs have been my way to manage all of those issues for a long time. Opiates would take away the pain, benzos would calm me down, stimulants would put me in a good mood and give me enough strenght to do things like any other human would. 

I don't feel ""high"" on drugs; rather, i feel normal. I feel like anyone else. Managing to have a good day is the true ""high"" in my case. And it's been possible only through drug use. 

I've been thinking about all of this recently. I've used opiates (ODSMT, to be specific) non-stop for two weeks and i've went deep into withdrawals; nothing i haven't experienced before, but i spent 6 days of pure hell. Again. 

One of things i've noticed is that i always seem to fall into addiction again whenever im left alone. 

I don't have any friends; my family, or rather, what's left of them since i've lost most of the members to diseases as a child, are the only friends i have. Whenever my mother goes out for example, i feel like i've been left alone. All of my issues seem to intensify to the point where i just say to myself ""f\*\*k it"" and fast-forward two weeks later, im now deep into addiction again. My use seems to be compulsive: most of the times i don't even properly dose my stuff; i just consume it untill it's gone. 

I guess this is nothing more than me venting; but i wanted to know if anyone else feels like this. 

If loneliness is what pushes you into addiction each time. 

It took me some time to write this down. I honestly feel ashamed of it. Im a 23 years old adult woman and yet i feel like a spoiled child. I hate being left alone. Just like a child would. I don't feel like talking about this with my family; they would probably think im completely losing it. Im so ashamed of feeling so immature at my age.

First, this account is a throwaway. If relevant, this is Texas.

I am in the process of trying to have her involuntarily committed. This is not ideal, or what I wanted, but she is in denial and will not seek help. She has ended up in the hospital several times over the last year, and ended up there again Monday after no sleep, no eating, and throwing up for 3 days straight. This was also a period of no contact from her, and had she not advised that she went to the hospital, I was about to call a wellness check.

I have no experience with this process. However, my friend is known to lie and manipulate to get out of whatever she may be in. She is also vocally against hospitalization or rehab.

Could use some feedback or just somebody to bounce things off of. Appreciate any help. (opiates/cannabis),"Long story short, I'm a 33 y/o male who has been struggling with addiction for most of my life. I was in IOP (outpatient) rehab as a teenager and eventually ended up in an inpatient stay at age 19, followed by a halfway and ""three-quarters"" house after that. I strung together about a year of clean time and worked the 12 step program pretty hard (not hard enough, clearly) but the God thing always was my major roadblock and was the excuse I used to eventually go back out (among others of course - pretty standard story).

Since then I've had varying degrees of issues with addiction, but things came to a head in my late 20's with opiates. I was at a point where I was spending $400+ a day on pills, taking incredibly stupid chances both professionally in my career and just legal risks in my day to day life (not to mention the obvious health and safety concerns from eating 150+ mg of oxycodone per day minimum plus other drugs). Long story still long, I finally realized right about the time that fake pills became extremely prevalent, that I was one hot pill away from dying and that I had to make a change. That was about 2 and a half years ago. I used Kratom as a harm reduction tool, and this allowed me to get off of pills completely about 2.5 years ago (and alcohol about 3+ years ago - although really I just replaced it with kratom and pills for a short time) - that's the bit of good news. I also quit smoking cigarettes at this time, although I'm still woefully addicted to nicotine via vaporizers (3% nicotine, but frequently throughout the day).

Another issue that has been progressively worsening since the age of 13 or so was my reliance on cannabis. It went from a fun diversion to actively detrimental to my day-to-day life and mental health long, long ago - and especially in the last 5-6 years, began to amplify my depression and particularly my anxiety so significantly that I was near suicidal (not only because of this of course, but I can't overstate how much my daily cannabis use has harmed me - while basically trying to ignore that it's even an issue because ""it's just pot right, totally innocuous...""). Obviously from a health and safety perspective it's light years away from the opiates, but it was arguably the most damaging substance for my mental health.

Fast forward to today. I've somehow managed to fail upwards in my career despite all these issues and thankfully am in a secure position financially, so I have that going for me. I also have an extremely supportive girlfriend (albeit one who really doesn't understand addiction at all), and at least a couple strong family connections left although much less than I would like. I quit my (very heavy) daily usage of all cannabis products (including delta 8 gummies, which I was taking because it caused less anxiety than regular d9 thc) last week, going on about a week now - don't recall the exact day. I have also tapered down my kratom usage steadily since that same time or a little before it, going from 30+ grams per day, every day, to only 3.5g as of today at 1:45 PM (normally I would be close to 20g or more by now on a normal day). My goal is to be able to get completely off of kratom in the next week or less if possible.

One small issue is that I am currently recovering from an injury (I'm a distance runner and strength train frequently, and tend not to rest as much as I should, causing somewhat frequent injuries) and as of now, kratom is really the only relief I have. OTC drugs like advil/tylenol help somewhat but are not as effective because the injury is not really inflammation-based. Quitting pot has also made these pains much more obvious and I can't just cover that up by fogging my brain out like I have been for so long. This is temporary, but my desire to remain fit is not, so I'll have to work around this and also move forward with a much smarter and safer methodology to training and recovery.

All the above aside, my main issue right now is that I live in a rural area with very little access to addiction assistance programs, including 12 step programs - only 2-3 meetings total each week within 30 miles of my location. I've tried some online meetings as well but I find that forcing myself to go to the meeting physically is important for remaining accountable. The other problem is that 90% of the people in these meetings are so far out of my demographic (60+, mostly women) that I have a very difficult time relating to them, and so I have a similar difficult time connecting to them - frankly, they all seem miserable, and I don't want what they have (except for the sobriety part). I know this is a pretty standard reservation and I'll just need to get over it, but that doesn't change the fact that I need to connect with people closer to my age range, life experience level, and probably also my own gender for the purposes of getting a new sponsor and securing the fellowship that I desperately need after pushing away countless friends and family members for years now.

Sorry if this is rambling, my brain is still clearing out some fog and I haven't really tried to put all this into words until now. I guess I'm just looking for maybe some good online resources in the meantime until I can find better local connections. I did reach out to my sponsor from several years back when I tried this again (albeit for a very short time before going back out), and he said that my call must have been a blessing in disguise since he had not been to a meeting since before COVID - so now we are meeting tomorrow evening for the meeting where I originally met him at the first time. I've been getting to meetings early to help set up and staying to break down etc. but have not made an earnest attempt at the steps again yet, mostly because I'm hoping that in the year 2022 there are some more evidence- and science-based options available that I may not be aware of in lieu of or in conjunction with a 12-step option as well.

In a couple of weeks I’ll have 2 years sober, and I did the 12 step jam for awhile but it’s just not my thing anymore. But now I just have literally no desire to drink or smoke weed, mainly because the thought of being high or drunk sounds absolutely miserable.

I chose celibacy cause I’ve had issues with relationships and sex and stuff and it’s done me a world of good!!! Truly, I’ve done a lot of really hard work, addressed a lot of issues, grown as a person etc. etc. 

So after 3 years of celibacy I finally feel ready to EASE into a relationship with that kind of intimacy. I use dating apps and have come across someone who I’ve really connected with. We share so many interests, they value and nurture their mental/emotional/physical health and I just feel this person is different in a way. Now idk where things will go, they may even go belly up which like I’m cool with. However I do know that they smoke weed casually and occasionally drink, and truly I feel really secure in my sobriety and don’t think it will be a problem.

Throw away for reasons that will soon be obvious. A large part of this will be ranting because context is valuable and I need to say it but don't have anyone I can trust enough to say it to, I know I should say everything to my therapist, but I barely have to confidence to type this out anonymously on the internet, and it's taken months to stop avoiding the truth of my past mistakes in the first place.

As for where I am at right now, I think I'm out of the red. I pretty sure I have figured out how to avoid becoming a massive failure, it's just a matter of figuring out the normal stuff now.

Anyway, this is the story of the absolute roller-coaster of a life these last three years. I have gone from being the top student athlete at my(relatively small) high school and being accepted to the computer science program at a pretty friggin respectable university to placing myself in dead end work at a job I don't care for, rapidly gaining weight and coming in and out of drug abuse. It's a fun one.

Troubles started when university started. I had coasted by in earlier school by doing all my homework in class/at lunch and never needing to study for tests because I would dedicate all my attention to lectures, working as hard as I could as to avoid needing to do anything outside of school. I was also a competent athlete in high school. I wasn't good enough to qualify for state/high level tournaments, but I worked hard enough that people knew my name around school. Compare this to university, where often the majority of learning is done outside the classroom, and there are no repercussions for doing poorly. Academic advisors don't care so long as you aren't getting F's, and when you parents ask about your grades, you can just lie. I did well in high school, what reason would they have to not trust me? I had no habits built up for doing anything of my own volition, so I struggled, I struggled bad. And there was no reputation I saw fit to maintain, either. As for athletics, the school was D1. I was good enough to practice, but was far from being good enough to compete. Sure, there are intermural teams, but that's not the same as competing against people your age who were doing the very best they could with the recourses they had. It didn't have the same thrill of competition, and competing was the main reason I suffered through practice. I was a leader on my sports teams, and I took satisfaction in knowing I worked harder than those around me. As for grades, people knew I did well, which I also took satisfaction in. Many also thought I was an insufferable teacher's pet, but why should I care what they think? Change scene back to college, a massive campus campus with a population in the tens of thousands, and no one gives a flying crap about how anyone else is doing or knows any student names outside of their friend groups. As for myself, suffice it to say I knew I was performing below average. And yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not motivate myself to form the habits I knew were needed for success. I used to work hard so I could go home and play video games without my parents getting on me about it, now I could play video games without anyone's approval. Also that insufferable teachers pet thing? I wasn't great at making friends.

First semester ends and I am scraping by. Halfway through the second semester, and I am attending half my classes. I am fully aware I am on the path to destruction. I deny that I may be suffering from depression, instead telling myself that I still enjoy life. (Which, to be fair, I did enjoy playing video games all day until I was reminded of my situation) I just told myself I was lazy and needed to ""do better"". Turns out telling yourself that doesn't actually achieve anything. If not for the covid shutdown swooping in to allow me not to count that semester's grades towards my GPA, it would have almost certainly marked the end of my academic career. And then, like the hand of the divine reaching out to me, an opportunity presented itself to me: a summer sales internship. The meetings I had with the recruiters were like a promise of everything I needed: focus on motivation and self improvement, of getting out of your comfort zone and creating life skills. I would be working with and learning from the recruiters - students like me who had found great success and made a decent chunk of change. When I called people who had worked for them previously I was given the confirmation I needed, a student who had previously been a stoner and an alcoholic, who after working for the company for a summer had become a productive student again, and was only not working for the company again because he had found a different internship in his field. Yeah.... it was a University approved MLM. (in the strictest technical terms, it wasn't an MLM because I didn't have to buy anything before I could work, but otherwise the ideas are the same) The saddest thing about it is that I think everyone, from the university(which allowed the company to operate in the business/internship building and recruit on campus) to the recruiters, was genuinely convinced that having students sell door to door for 70-80 hours a week was a good thing. It may have not been an entirely evil thing and I think I worked with people who have genuine good intentions, but now I have intense rejection dysphoria and have a very real understanding of the 80/20 principle. I'm still no better at detecting deception, I am trusting to a fault.

Anyway, I was told by someone two weeks into working that rumor had spread that I was a stalker/child predator. Also the police were looking for me so they could perform an arrest. (On a side note, please consider when relaying that kind of information that the person may be a victim and it is probably the first time they have heard about it. I know I bear responsibility for my actions and it was my imperative to see through what I was being fed as to not cause good people worry and concern, but I will never get the image out of my head of that woman telling me that I looked like a stalker because my face was blank and emotionless. This is normally my response when I go into shock). I know this may not be directly relating to my questions, but it is very much a part of who I am. Yay for trauma. I wept until no more tears came and quit the job that day. By the time my next semester came around, anything positive I may have taken from the program. It was even worse, by the first month I was attending none of my classes. I had picked up a part time job, but despite showing me how badly I wanted to stay in college rather than start working full time, it provided no motivation towards my academics. Outside of work and a party I went to where I smoked weed for the first time and got so crossfaded I didn't feel okay again for three days, I was simply rotting in my room. I played video games when I was awake, and at night I would lay awake, praying and wishing for some escape from my powerlessness. I called my Mom, told her I was suffering from depression, and withdrew from the university. 

I started a job search quickly and, to my surprise, got a decent enough job pretty much instantly through a high school acquaintance. In many ways, it may have been exactly what I needed. The job didn't pay a lot, but I didn't care. I was house sitting for my parents while they negotiated with a business to sell the property, and being that the business was taking their sweet time, for the foreseeable future my only expense was paying for food, gas, and utilities. The work was easy and I could distract myself with audiobooks so it wasn't so bad. I worked overtime when it was asked of me, and my work ethic and efficiency was recognized. I was told that, if I stuck with it, I could go anywhere I wanted to within the company. But something felt wrong. I wasn't interacting with anyone at work since I got through the day by dissociating, and I never really hung out with anyone. It was a very solitary existence. I was also eating out for every single lunch and couldn't motivate myself to work out or complete personal projects. My social anxiety, both from my earlier attempts at making organic friends and from my newfound rejection complex. Thus, I made little effort into making new friends. When offered new opportunities at work, I would try them but shrink away at the slightest resistance or anything that would require my mind to be present more than it had to be. I was drifting through life in complete stagnation.

 I made an appointment with my doctor to ask about getting treatment for depression, was told that yep, I had depression, and was prescribed some meds and sent to a therapist. At the time my understanding of what was wrong with me was very different, and I did not effectively communicate my issues. Also the meds made me feel like absolute crap, and the whole think about taking months or even years to find the right meds didn't exactly appeal to me. So, I stopped taking meds. Since I listened to books all day, I listened to one about depression. The book denounced the value placed on medication and instead promoted changing a person's life in order to absolve one's self of such suffering. There was probably great value in that book, especially in the realms of finding meaningful work, making friends, touching some grass, and a few other things I was failing to do. But motivating myself to up and do those things in my life was far from simple, as I had no support system. Instead I called up my only good friend from high school who was still in town, suffering from many of the same issues as me, and we got \*wasted\*. We would call up someone over 21 to buy us some cheap vodka and take shots until the bottle was empty. Gosh those nights were fun, made me feel like everything was going to be okay, if only for a little bit. I also tried smoking with him, but weed and I don't get along. Alcohol makes me forget that I am impaired, but weed makes my mind feel dull. This detail is important because of what happens next. I am sure many people have heard the term ""gateway drug"" before in reference to weed. With all the talk of legalization and medical applications, I think people have failed to realize what gateway drug means. It's not a gateway drug because it makes you do more drugs, but because it's illegal. People try this thing that's supposed to be dangerous but hey, it didn't seem so bad. At this point, legality is no longer a measure on what a person should or should not try. For me, it was alcohol. Something I oughtn't do under the age of 21, yet I felt fine, even better as I was now interacting with someone. Then came the perfect storm. The book I was reading spoke about recent treatment for depression looking into psychedelic drugs. Miraculous experiences that can reassign one's values and potentially help with depression. The same day I listened to the argument for treatment with them, a coworker I spoke with on break mentioned how micro dosing was having a positive impact on him. And then, that exact same day, I gained access to such drugs. I took LSD for the first time that weekend.

Now I do not to dissuade anyone from the medical applications of such substances, but I harshly caution against any form of self medication or recreational use. Drugs are for losers. In terms of wasted money, drugs have cost me more than anything with the exception of fast food, league of legends skins, and my unplayed steam games. Money which sure would be nice right about now. Not all by the cost of the substances I have taken, but the in the cost of drugs I have tossed in determination of never doing anything again, the cost of pissing on the carpet of a hotel room and abashedly explaining the situation to a very supportive and understanding receptionist, and the cost of an emergency room visit I made after not getting any reaction off of some mushrooms I had eaten and worrying that I had poisoned myself. (I hadn't. There is more to that last story, but suffice it to say me chasing a high landed me a $1k hospital bill). And none of that includes the costs of the bad trips I have suffered, the close calls with actions that quite possibly could have ruined my life, the self hate of the choices I have made, and the lies I still tell to this day. 

The first time on LSD wasn't so destructive by itself. I both enjoyed myself and had an experience that resolved me to better myself. I stopped drinking and trying weed, I worked harder at work, and even started working out... briefly. I was basically back to normal depresso mode after two weeks, but things were still headed in a positive direction, if slowly. That was until that friend I mentioned earlier got kicked out of his parents house when he came home smelling so intensely of weed his parents thought he had smoked it in the house. Who had a place for him to stay? me. I did. Oh the choices I would have made differently today if I knew now what I knew then. The things I would have tried in order to get us to turn our lives around. Resume drinking, especially when I turned 21, occasional social smoking, and the reintroduction of the drug that made my life so much easier for two weeks. Over the next month, I did LSD once, shrooms once, and LSD a second time. That second time I took a massive dose which sent me down a very unsafe line of thought because of the lack of a tripsitter. It is another trauma I will never forget. A deeply spiritual experience of self punishing thoughts that were ultimately meaningless. Basically, I resolved myself again to not take drugs while under the influence of LSD, but knew that I needed some way to prevent myself from doing them again. Being that I was not in a rational state of thought, I decided the problem was that I was enjoying them. I thought if I didn't like them, I wouldn't do them again. Well I got what I wished for. I had a lot of dangerous thoughts that night, and in the two days it took my mind to return to normal, all I could think about were the horrors I chose to imagine, and the profoundness of which they seemed to have.

And yet eventually even that horror faded, and the thoughts of euphoria I had experienced and dreams of experiences which would fix my inadequacies eventually won. I took LSD once more before he had to move out because the house needed to get ready for sale. Nothing profound happened, yet neither did nothing horrific. It was just kind of sorta fun I guess. My longing for profound experience and solutions persisted, which resulted in that emergency room incident, later followed by the carpet pissing incident a few months later. What confused me so much during this time was how I kept wanting to go back. Knowing the cost of the hospital visit was not enough to dissuade me, nor did my second bad trip when the carpet pissing ensued was enough to convince me to throw out the other mushrooms I had stashed. It was so bizarre, I knew my actions made no logical sense and yet they kept happening. Not too long after the carpet pissing did I start to watch breaking bad. Where as some people see a forbidden allure in some of that show, I saw the horror in which I was, in some small way, involving myself in. Especially with how Jesse's relationship with his brother reminded me of my oldest brother, who still smokes weed and occasionally does LSD, despite having kids of his own. I was horrified of the drugs that, at this point, I was hiding in my parents house as I lived with them. I wanted to throw them out, cast them away, but I kept finding an excuse to hang onto them. For the first time I tried a microdose while my parents were out. Even this tiny bit sent me spinning into an existential crisis and filled me with anxiety. I finally managed to convince myself to throw them out. I am not sure I could have made the same decision if I waited until I was fully sober.

I was having this massive individual struggle with what was developing into a kind of cycle of doing drugs, stopping everything, and then try again after a few months. Meanwhile, I appeared to be having a completely functional life on the outside. I was working 40+ hours a week, paying my bills, and chose to give college a second try when I had to chose between that and having to pay rent in the current housing market. School sounded cheaper, and perhaps offered change, though I was likely on a path to simply have history repeat itself.

My salvation came in the form of more drugs: joking. I was having really bad brain fog at work, especially when I took up some management responsibility and had to spend more time not zoned out. So I set up an appointment with my doctor. He wanted me to look into possible ADHD and referred me to a psychiatrist. I wasn't convinced, maybe thought I was pretty low on the scale if I did have it, I did well in primary/secondary school after all.

No, I have ADHD, big time. It just didn't manifest in the stereotypical ways. Common ways, just not the ones that are as easy to spot. It is no exaggeration to say my life has been turned upside down by proper treatment. It's quite ironic that taking speed(it's a joke, ADHD people on meds aren't high all the time, they react differently to the meds than a person with a normal brain would. Please do not abuse prescription medication.) has freed me from addiction. Rather than feeling the compulsion to play video games every waking moment, I have barely been playing them at all. It's not that I don't enjoy them, I just don't feel like I need to play them. As for the desire to take psychedelics, it's gone. Like completely. I don't need a powerful experience to fix me, it couldn't, I had a different problem. What was likely the more powerful motivator, the euphoria I had felt at certain points which high, no longer has the same appeal. Sure, I would feel nice, but it wouldn't actually achieve anything even in the best of circumstances. College is an absolute breeze, especially when a normal college's normal rigor degree is compared to a rigorous school's computer science program. I have been freed.

Not so say its all milk and honey, I still have rejection disphoria and other normal person problems. But now I feel like I can actually start.

Man typing that out was therapeutic. I didn't realize I needed that. Anyway, onto the reason I opened up this browser tab two and a half hours ago.

&#x200B;

0.)I respond well to book recommendations

1.) how do I forgive myself for past actions, or what could have been? These past years have not been without learning, but I can't help but think about what could have been if I had gotten proper treatment sooner, of the trauma I could have avoided. And I know I still have my whole life left, but I feel as if I have stained myself, as if I am made unclean by my actions, or that they will still come back to haunt me, especially when some of the events I spoke of are quite recent. I do not wish to forget, but I am wasting time when I wade in such thoughts. I could just blame my ADHD for everything, but that would be evading responsibility and the fact that I still functioned at an above minimum function level for most of my life without treatment, I  know I could have done better.

2.) How to make friends? Real ones I mean. It's simple enough to meet with old acquaintances or find someone to hang out with. I don't know how to find and seek out the kind of relationships that will encourage me to become a stronger person and fulfil the human requirement of community and relationship.

3.) How to I build a concept of money? The aforementioned expenses made by my idiocy have evaporated my entire savings and made me painfully aware of how much I suck at money. If not those mistakes, I would have found another way. Money is no more than numbers and paper to me. I can try and think of something in terms of hours worked, but that also has no meaning to me. I cannot conceptualize it. If I did not have a sizeable excess of money in the last year, I don't think I could have made it even a month.

4.) How do I learn about building meaningful romantic relationships? Now that chasing dopamine is no longer the sole purpose for my existence, I have decided that I think I kinda might wanna get married some day. Maybe even have a kid or something like that. But I've done the math, and it shows that I have spent approximately 99.42% of my life as a single man. I do not have the first clue about anything in this realm. I am losing weight and trying to work towards the looks that once drew the attention of a few girls when I was younger, but that's about as far as I have planned for and know that looks are far from enough.

5.)What is the measure of a decent man? What example should I work towards if I want to create a fulfilling life for myself and those around me?

6.) So the friend I spoke about, I still care for him dearly. He does not have the same proactively destructive relationship with drugs that I did, but he is the picture perfect definition of a stoner. He works a dead end package pushing job, has no ambition, smokes all day, drinks when he gets the opportunity to party, does little but play video games in his free time, and takes psychedelic drugs explicitly for the high. He also has been single for roughly the same amount of his life as I have, despite actively trying unlike I have. When he isn't high, he is intelligent and a joy to be around. He was my polar opposite, the vulgar to my uptight, the funny to my serious, the actively immature to my I-think-I-am-mature-but-am-really-a-prick, the prom king to my teachers pet(literally, we both got elected these titles). Its a wonder that we ended up as friends. He has no desire other than to relax and enjoy life. It's like an anti-buddha.  Where as the spiritual guy freed himself from all desire and is admired, this friend wishes for hookups and uses substances to stimulate happiness. Is that an okay way to live? A lifestyle which will leave him with gratitude at his younger self and the contentment of a fulfilling life? If it is not, what can a do for him to make him desire something else?

7.)How to not be an ass? I am serious, I say some dumb, selfish things and want to leave a positive impact on people's lives, rather than a negative one. Especially with how many negative impacts I have created thus far...

&#x200B;

As for anyone who wants to answer that God/Jesus/Allah/Buddah/Shiva/The One/Other spiritual caring being loves me and to seek him out, I am working on it. I understand the value a good community can bring to someone's life.  When I find a community which exemplifies their moral teachings and can lead me to becoming a right man, a ""good fruit"", then I will join them.

Just want to check in and say hi and ask how you are all doing, and share my experience so far with going sober and going through PAWS.

&#x200B;

I was a poly drug user of mostly stimulants, so started with MDMA, then cocaine, MKAT(Mephedrone), Speed etc.

Was a weekend user but was using twice a week in patches, started taking these drugs when I was 17, before that smoked some weed from being around 14-15.

I'm 36 now and have been off these stimulants for 5.5 months now, I smoked some weed and drank a few times at the start, but haven't touched anything recently, not even nicotine or caffeine, this is due to the anxiety attacks.

A big turning point for me was around 4.5 to 5 months where I got out of the rut I was in which started at around month 1, I was really bad for a while, no motivation to do anything, very depressed and no emotions, dark dark place.

Currently I'm much more motivated and don't really have any depression, however the anxiety is quite bad at times, anxiety attacks and thinking I am about to die due to a heart attack or because I am going to faint, which I think have been 100% psychosomatic, I have been checked out multiple times at the ER, each time is pretty scary because the anxiety makes me feel like I'm dying and it almost feels like psychosis, at times I feel like I'm being attacked by negative energy or spirits, I know this is the psychosis but when it happens it feels very real.

I still think I'm not 100% there yet in terms of feeling happy and normal again, I think it could be 1 year or even a bit more to get back to my new normal, but right now I can deal with life and get things done such as work.

Thought I'd just share where I am at for other people, the 5-6 months seems to be a big one.

But now I find myself battling my addiction to meth. Last year in July my little brother committed suicide and it happened at a time where I was in another state with no friends or family trying to do well at a new job that I left my home and family for. It was almost constant lock down the whole time I was there too. It eventually got too much and I moved back to my home and started looking for a new job. From the moment I arrived and went into quarantine at home I was offered meth by someone who I know only visits once a year generally. So I said yes. And it's gone down hill from there. I have used it to escape my grief, which it does for a moment, then I'm back in it with self loathing added in. 
I have taken the step to admit my drug use to my partner and close friend. That was incredibly hard and draining but a step in the right direction.
I have used again though in secret since admitting it, though only once, and I'm so angry with myself and frustrated and I hate this. 
My health has rapidly deteriorated.
I don't want to use again. I want my old self back and I want to show the people I love that I can do this.
If you've read this thank you. I've tried to summarise as much as I can but that's the gist of it.

The truth is, I'm not completely out of the woods yet, but I want to share one thing that has tremendously helped me because I think it might help others. 

Several years ago I was playing billiards with a friend who was significantly older than me. I asked about his story. He had been sober for about 15 years at that point. For as long as I've known him, he's been a solid, upstanding person. However, he told me about his former addictions and failed attempts at recovery. He told me about the shotgun wound in his leg when he was struggling with cocaine. He told me about being in prison because of his 5th DUI. 

I asked him what got him over the hump - and he told me about something I'd never heard of before. After he was out of prison, he was court ordered to take a drug called disulfiram. The drug itself is nothing new. It's been used to treat alcoholism with mixed results for decades. Essentially, the drug makes a person allergic to alcohol. For him, this worked. It took at least one failure where he ended up extremely sick, but it worked. 

At the time, I had a great job, but my insides were hell. I hated myself so much. I would cut myself with a razor and dream about death - partly because I hadn't found a way to quit. My dui came a few months later when I blew a .24 driving a motorcycle without a helmet. Soon after, I quit my job when a blade went too deep and I couldn't hide my depression anymore. Not long after, my wife left me. I could keep going with the stories, but I think that's enough to give you a picture - my life was in freefall. It wasn't all from alcohol, but for me, alcohol was like putting gasoline on the fire. 

Anyway, I remembered my friend's story and tracked down some disulfiram. It wasn't court ordered, rather it was voluntary - I think that was key. When I was in the middle of my struggles, I would fight myself and if I lost for only one moment, I was drinking again. Disulfiram flipped the script. Now, if I take a pill I can't drink for a week. So, instead of one moment of weakness and I lose,  it's one moment  of strength and I have (at least) one week of sobriety. For me, there's also a big difference between having to fight moment after moment and completely taking the option off the table. 

It might sound strange, but I can describe it like this: if my vices and virtues were two basketball teams playing each other, alcohol was a star player on the other side that was pretty good at scoring, but also great at assists. Disulfiram was like taking that player out of the game. I still have to play the game, but it's a lot easier to win now. 

I don't share my struggles because I'm proud of them or proud of the recovery. I'm actually extremely ashamed of them and know that I still have battles in front of me that I need to win. Rather, I share because of my own weakness - I doubt I would have made the progress I've made without that drug. I'm very grateful to my friend for sharing his story with me. 

So what I have to say is this. I hope that helps you. Know I'm not advising rushing out and trying another drug to fix your problems - I'm not - disulfiram is not something to be played around with or taken lightly. However, if you know you need to quit alcohol but can't seem to figure it out. Or, if you are trying to quit but have to battle with constant arguments in your head, maybe look into it. 

I hope this helps someone out there. Regardless of the path you take, if you're struggling - I feel you. I'm sorry. I hope you rise up, and continue to rise again and again and again until you learn to never fall. There is light on the other side.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48902163}"

I shot a little in my mouth through the straw and was instantly hooked on the warm fuzzy feeling that happened seconds after. I started using it in the car on the way home which ended up making me pass out and crash my car head on into a utility pool taking the whole thing and which made power lines cover the road.

The sad part is, that didn’t teach me jack shit. I even started to use it around my individuals (group home). They were mentally disabled so they didn’t know what I was doing). I asked the cops if I could get anything out of my car (keys etc) but the thing I was most worried about was the brand new can of duster sitting in the floor of my passenger seat. I got a ride home from an officer. 

You’d think that’s enough to scare someone, but for the next week or so and still to this day I can’t seem to shake it. Every store around here doesn’t seem to sell it or is out of stock which is infuriating. I can’t order any online either since my girlfriend is very nosy with my nail these days (right fully so).

Clearly I have a problem here. It’s affecting my relationship and has gotten me (almost) kicked out three times now. Why is this stuff so glorious/hard to kick?

I realize how terrible and desperate this sounds, but my psychiatrist only out my in klonopin 0.5 to see if that would help with my terrible anxiety which it did absolutely nothing. I basically demanded she put me back on Xan 0.5 which helps me in the short term. 

I got caught last night using duster with my girlfriend in the bed next to me. She made me empty all of the cans in front of her (excruciating). Whenever I get yelled at for it, my mind instantly goes to “oh I’ll show you” and ended up taking 11 of my Xanax (I’m alive by the way). 

I think my problem is that I am always looking for something to make me not feel the boring monotony of every day life. Klonopin did nothing, too much alcohol makes me vomit, pills make me feel super groggy, and duster is a make a or break for my relationship. 

I feel trapped because life is not exciting whatsoever. Mom is an alcoholic and everybody is working all the time so I feel like a loser whenever I’m just at home. 

The other part is I plan around my girlfriends work schedule so I can be able to do these things. I have many hiding places for anything but I always end up falling asleep with a can in my hand or in the floor or something which gives it away and I feel very dumb. 

I would ask if there is something wrong with my but that would be a dumb question. And yes, I do realize the dangers of air duster but I just can’t get it through my head that it is lethal and the stupid bitterent they put in always makes me sick at some point.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.89787585}"

Please forgive me if this is not the right subreddit & feel free to point me in the right direction. 

My boyfriend of 1.5 years is currently in rehab & will be going to sober living afterwards. I’m really, really proud of him for taking the steps to get better & I just want to see him be the best version of himself. 

This is the first time I’ve ever seen addiction & recovery this close, & I’m having a really hard time coping with certain aspects of it (such as how things will be different from now on, especially because we’ll be long distance after he gets out). 

I do not want to burden him with how I’m feeling because I know he has to focus on his sobriety. I’m currently looking for a therapist to help me, but I was wondering if there was any subreddits for someone in my position?

I also have ADHD and some other minor health things. So today I went to the doctor for my three month prescription appointment that I attended in person for the first time since getting sober last year, I've just been attending video appointments. I knew my doctor had ordered a blood draw a long time ago (2017 it turns out) that I have been putting off because it's so hard to draw blood and I have a lot of shame around that. Today I saw a new doc because I procrastinated and ran out of meds and my regular doc was booked up. I love my regular doc but this new one had a different energy and we kinda vibed, and he saw some of my old bloodwork and I had been fasting so he got me to agree to a blood draw. I'm obviously not squeamish with needles but I always feel so bad for the phlebotomists and worry they might get down on themselves and also, as stated, shame, so I geared up for an ordeal. I did all I could to help them out but it took about 6 tries and an old veteran using a pediatric gauge to get my blood. But y'all, I FUCKIN DID IT! Pardon my French but I was pleading with God, willing my blood to flow so I could take care of my poor body and it came through! I'm so proud of my body, I've been so hard on her and she just shows up when I need her, so I'm so happy to have been able to accomplish this task. I know it may not seem like a big deal but I'm crying so it was a big deal to me! Hopefully someone sees this who needs to overcome some shame so they can take care of themselves, its *SO* worth it!
