Of your best friends and family, who supports your recovery and overall health? These are the relationships you need to cultivate. These relationships may have been damaged in the past by things you did while you were using. One way to rebuild trust is to accept your supportive friends and family exactly as they are, rather than trying to change or control them. Focus on the positive traits they bring to the relationship.

Try to think about the other person's needs, while staying aware of your own. Ask what you can do to be a better friend and follow through on what they ask for. Ask your Higher Power to help you build relationships and grow in them.

Action for the Day

Think about your most supportive friends or family, and ask yourself what you can do to rebuild their trust in you.

But the therapist here seems to not really understand why I am craving drugs, and thought my withdrawal was only supposed to last 5 days as she had read on the internet (WTF?!). I still feel like I'm detoxing.

Anyways, I'm fucking depressed and my cravings are getting out of control to the point where I have been considering leaving just to get some relief. But I will regret it if I do, and possibly die, and definitely be homeless. But it feels like I can't hold out forever these cravings are too strong. They are breaking me and I'm giving up on the hope that I will ever feel okay without drugs. It feels like I am completely unable to feel pleasure, or optimistic about anything. It also feels like maybe this isn't normal, because I've seen many people around me get clean and sober without looking so miserable and stressed out.

I was looking for food in the fridge, and noticed a bottle of sherry cooking wine, and the impulse set in immediately.

I have no one to share this with, so thought i would just post here, because i feel the need to say it somewhere so fuck it. I thought i would never be happy or feel content enough with life without M & C. And even some days it‚Äôs still hard because i sometimes fantasize about taking it again and how it would feel but i realize more that the fantasy of it sounds better and more exciting than the actual taking of it. I strive to be 100% real and one thing that motivates me to not take this stuff is the realization that everything is fake when you‚Äôre on it. Your feelings toward a person, your actions, what you say etc. I fucking hated when i thought about what i did, what i said and that it didn‚Äôt resignate at all with who i am. I can say that i do not miss the nights where i couldn‚Äôt sleep. I don‚Äôt miss the guilt trips and promising that next time i won‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt miss having a cigarette at the crack of dawn looking at the sunrise with no sleep making myself think it was beautiful while i was a fucking mess. I don‚Äôt miss being sick and having no energy because of this shit. That also helps as motivation, thinking of the aftermath. My mental health has gotten way better. But this has also been very lonely, still is to be honest. I don‚Äôt really have friends. But i‚Äôd rather be lonely than be high with people. I have a very big problem with trusting people. Being high meant avoiding my problems and being sober i had to face them all and i am still learning about myself to this day. Being high was like receiving a hug for a while and then getting beat down. But the beat down didn‚Äôt even bother me in the beginning because the high was enough for me, shit it was more than enough. It was something telling me it loved me, something that made me feel like i didn‚Äôt need anybody. It gave me confidence, it threw all my problems away. But damn, what a mask it wears. 
Even after this 1 year journey so far with tears and loss i fucking love waking up fresh in the morning. I love working on my mental health. I love staying in and doing things that benefit for me and my knowledge. I love going to sleep with no accelerated heart beat to keep me up. I love having a walk or chilling by myself somewhere, listening to music and writing and with an added cigarette. Oh that reminds me, anyone else smoke like 100 cigs when on a high? fuck that was crazy. Funny when i think about it. My friend who i mostly got high with, we like lived ate and breathed cigarettes. I smoke a lot less now but i have one occasionally. 


My next obstacle is alcohol. I‚Äôve been sober from that for 3 weeks, initially 3 months but i relapsed. I went so much harder on the drugs than the alcohol but i still have the tendency to binge so i‚Äôd rather get it out of my life alltogether. Also i am 20 years old, for anyone who‚Äôs young on here that‚Äôs also thinking of getting sober or is on the journey, it definitely can be done at a young age, and if youre on the journey: high five motherfucker.  It‚Äôs hard because fuck when you‚Äôre sober from alcohol & drugs you see how much it‚Äôs used & normalized in the teenage world. Hell, alcohol is normalized almost everywhere and in all age worlds.

To everyone currently getting sober: let‚Äôs kick ass and remember it‚Äôs okay to not feel okay about this shit, i hope to fuck that you cry, let it all out, we‚Äôve been numbing it. Embrace your ugly and your beautiful !!!! Accept it all !",119,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.36408803}"

When they found out they freaked out and basically took everything that I had and made it impossible for me to buy any more drugs. They are the type of people think that all drugs are bad, except for legal ones, and are making me stop because they are worried about my health. They are unwilling to change their beliefs on drugs or do any research about drugs. They cannot accept me living a life where I use any drugs, even just occasionally. Now I understand their actions are out of love and care for me, but I just don't agree with them wanting me to be sober.

 I'll admit I've been dependent on amphetamine for a few months now and at times I may have used too much, but when this has happened I have always managed to eventually cut back down. I do want to reduce my usage, but I don't want to stop. The thing is that I don't think that my drug usage made my life any worse than before, in fact, I think that it improved my quality of life. Before my amphetamine use, I was severely depressed, unmotivated to do anything, and had difficulty concentrating on certain tasks for most of my life. Drugs have made me more sociable, better at school, and just happier in general. 

I do want to keep using amphetamine at therapeutic doses, as I think that the positives and improvements in my quality of life caused by my usage outweigh the negative health effects. I mean I don't even think that amphetamine is that unhealthy. I am aware of the damage it can cause to the brain if it is abused, and the slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate it can cause, but I still don't see it as that unhealthy. It is also safer than a lot of other stimulants as it doesn't directly interfere with channels in the heart. I think that the most amount of damage amphetamine can potentially do is due to lack of sleep, but I don't go on amphetamine binges and try to get 8hrs of quality sleep every night. 

So then why should I go sober? I have tried going sober a few times, and each time I have waited long enough for most of the withdrawal effects to dissipate, but every time I do, I just realize that my old life sucked and that my life isn't worth living sober, so I go back to using.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5247164}"

I was trying to score today and I ran into a girl I used to hang with back when I had a bad habit. She didn‚Äôt even sound like the same person. She spoke slower and was slurring and just sounded like someone who was mentally impaired. Beyond what someone whos just overly intoxicated sounds like though. And she literally just couldn‚Äôt find any of her stuff when I dropped her off. It took her like 15 minutes to get out because she just seemed unable to get all her stuff together. I‚Äôm assuming she suffered brain damage during an overdose and it‚Äôs just awful. I mean honestly she was a bad person. She has BPD and was untreated. I‚Äôm not trying to demonize bpd people because I know how hard  it is to have that disorder but she was just a terrible person. She tried to steal from me multiple times and always seemed to be angling to try and get shit out of me (I would only hang with her when I couldn‚Äôt find drugs any other way). But it was still hard to see her like that and I felt bad for her. She did seem to have a humane side and also had some weird attachment to me. I guess I just feel lucky too.

I feel like it‚Äôs a wake up call that I need to quit again before it‚Äôs too late.

Edit: I appreciate the sentiment but I fully realize the gravity of the situation I‚Äôm in and that I will completely fuck up my life and probably die if I don‚Äôt get clean.

I‚Äôm on twice weekly pick ups, when I do pick up I have to take it at the pharmacy that day. I have bad anxiety on my best days and I really fear withdrawal if quarantined. This panic is bothering me enough. I had trouble getting paracetamol the other day which I take for chronic pain (not allowed pain meds anymore other than paracetamol and meloxicam, an NSAID). and doctors don‚Äôt like to prescribe it anymore. 

I‚Äôm just anxious about all this. I‚Äôve been on a taper but not been great at it having to go back up temporarily with a view of going down 1mg at a time when I‚Äôm ready and my keyworker didn‚Äôt put my fears at ease. She‚Äôs a great keyworker don‚Äôt get me wrong but didn‚Äôt know about any contingency plans and addicts are not exactly a priority unless at medical risk. I‚Äôm going back up because I‚Äôvs been close to possibly relapsing and other side effects and got ambitious with my last drop.

This is her story atleast the portion of it I shared with her.,"Going through a lot I met this woman december 2018/january 2019. She was living a rough life. I think she was triggered by a bad break up. She had two children one she had out of high school and one she had about 5-6 years ago. She had custody of neither due to her addiction. She was a beautiful woman, though at this point she damn near skin and bones but I know she had problems with drugs spanning back to high school where her boyfriend of time introduced her and got her hooked on em. I won't hide it she did resort prostitution to get her money. She lived with one of her friends who allowed her in his home he was and is an upstanding ex-military guy letting her in his home rent free/ no expectations of favors. I had never been around an addict before so while hanging out with her I truly did not understand her. I just couldn't fathom her staying up for 24 hours + at a time and she was literally unable to sleep until she would get a dose of her drug of choice. She tried to hide it at first because she thought I would think differently of her after I saw her needle kit, I told her I didn't think differently of her and she warned me she was going to shoot up, I watched her.  

She had a strange speech pattern, she talked very quickly and always mumbled her words, I literally thought it was just an accent from her home state, but it was just the drugs. Whenever she'd shoot up her mind would just go out of it, she would get up and walk around like a zombie just moaning and speaking not even words just incoherent noises, sometimes she would be masturbating herself she would run into walls, into the bed, anything and sometimes end up with bruises. I know she would shoot up before going on a ""date"" sometimes but most times she'd only dose herself up to that zombie state whenever she intended to sleep. And her sleep was strange she could literally sleep for like a whole 15 hours.  

At some point she got into a situation where she owed a drug dealer money, he caused some trouble and her friend kicked her out of his place. I would have gladly invited her to my place, but I stayed with family and I know they wouldn't allow her to stay. I childishly said I'd make them allow her to stay, but she said she wasn't going to run from her problems. Looking back I'd say with addiction there is no running. I bet drug dealers loan out money all the time to addicts, because whatever abuse whatever danger they will always willingly return to a source of their fix I came to realize. For fear of her getting hurt I paid off the money she owed to her dealer true to the debt she didn't have any problems after that, she would reguluarly continue purchasing from this dealer.At this point I did the best I could to get her hotel rooms to stay in to atleast keep her off the street. I make decent money at my job but I gotta say to live in a hotel everyday you have to be rich or be doing something illegal. I'm not proud of it, but she did have to continue her prostitution to pay for that hotel room because I ran broke trying, I could always go back to my families place, but she didn't have anywhere to go, of course this was her only source of money so she was going to do it either way. It was awful to watch but her life literally revolved around drugs and sex for drugs or money to get drugs. I don't personally have a problem with prostitution but when its mixed with drugs it just ain't right, There's a big difference between a woman who wants to make some side money and a woman who will do anything she can to get her fix atleast in my eyes.  

This beautiful shell of a woman didn't have any self worth. She hated prostituting she hated shooting up everyday but she couldn't stop herself. At some point in trying to take care of her I fell for her, but she said she couldn't reciprocate this as she currently felt nothing on the drugs, she really tried to push me into meeting other women and said I could do much better.  

At some point in my long absence from home my family found out who I was hanging around and you better believe my own mother went into snoop mode to get me away from her, she literally somehow got into contact with her mother and whoever had custody of her kids. Honestly my mother blowing everything up like that did some good. She had to go back to her home state and  end up going to rehab to try to keep a relationship with her eldest.  

She had a rocky start up there thought she was immediately jailed after the plane landed for prior charges she had in her home state that she ran out on. She went to rehab when she got out I sent her about 500 for rehab supplies. She was kicked out within a week or 2 for fighting with another rehab patient. Her mother was pissed and did not allow her to return home, she asked me help her again. I sent her about 500 dollars again and sent her abut 300 to get her a hotel room a couple days until she got into a 2nd time.

This time it was a fit she stayed in that rehab for a whole month, her mother told me she had never in her life been in rehab that long. We talked on the phone a couple times a week when she would have phone time, we would reminisce about kind of being room mates sharing hotel rooms and some point in the conversation she said she wanted something more with me, that took me by surprise I always did love her she knew that but I never thought anything would come of it, but here we were. After she finished her month of rehab she went back to live with her mom and step dad on their farm. I flew up to visit her and got to meet her parents and everything visited her for a week. I was happy everything was going well, I wanted her to move back down with me after I saved up enough money for a place, but she wanted custody of eldest daughter beforehand so we had to keep it long distance.  

Shortly after she had a relapse. After finding out her mother gave her an ultimatum of go to rehab for another month or be kicked out, she refused to do another month of rehab and was kicked out. This led to me sending her money for hotel rooms again and her going back to escorting ways. She begged me to send her money for a car, said if she had a car and a little bit of money she could hold down a job (she used to be a stripper) and move in somewhere to pay rent. Eventually I took a loan out to send her money to get the car so she could atleast be mobile, she eventually moved in with a room mate she found on craigslist and moved in to his place this past July. This guy was an asshole who seemed normal but the what he said to her in private was psycho I'd rather not to discuss him, but she ended up buying a faulty car and didn't even have a mechanic look at it beforehand so she coudn't refund it and as she got deeper into her addiction she didn't keep up with it or try to get it fixed.

At some point she told me of the problems she had with this room mate and how far into her addiction she was she wanted to go back to rehab, I was happy and gladly sent her money but she didn't go to rehab she would always be going ""sunday"" but when sunday came she would never go. I wanted to wait until she went to rehab before I would visit her but at some point I realized I had no idea when she would actually go to rehab.  

I came to visit her again this past late november/early december and saw what the situation was with this room mate. After I spent another week with her catching up and discussing what she wanted to do. When I got back home I took out a 2k loan and sent her the money to pay first month/security deposit for a legitimate roommate. She promised with her customers she'd be able to afford rent from here on out. She wasn't able to pay rent next month and went back to hotel hopping. We even went through the whole going to rehab on ""sunday"" event again as well.  

At some point she met a friend Meaghan, meaghan was a lot like me and she would try tot ake care of her and stay with her in her hotel rooms like I used to when she lived in my state. I had always wanted her to just up and come back down to florida with me, she had recent run ins with the law and she wanted to continue out all her court dates as she still wanted a chance to get custody of her kid.  

This past thursday she was wheezing, she woke meaghan and aked her for help as she was gasping, she turned blue and collapsed. Me and meaghan thought it was an asthma attack at the time cause she always did have breathing issues and got pneumonia sometimes. It took the EMTs 10 minutes to get there and 5 minutes to get a pulse. I was so fucking scared, but they got a pulse I hoped she'd pull through and this was gonna be her rock bottom moment. Me and meaghan talked about how we'd try to get her into rehab after she recovers from this. The doctors placed her in an induced coma and cooled her body down to allow her brain and body to heal. The next day they lowered the sedation and checked her responses. She had no response to anything they tried pupils you name. She passed midnight on saturday. Doctors said it wasn't an asthma attack her heart had an issue and couldn't handle the long term drug use and I'm guessing was temporarily unable to pump oxygen. She was 31 years old.

I had never been as close to anyone as I was to this woman and I've only known her for about a year and 2 months, we'd have been officially together through all this a year in May. When I was there in november/december we had a heart to heart she told me I had been her ride or die for a while now always there for her moreso than her own family she felt and one of the only people she had been true to. She would always tell me I deserved better than some junkie and she was sorry she couldn't be the woman I deserved. She was my dream girl. I always imagined a future we'd have together. She would eventually go to rehab she has done it before so she'll do it again I thought. Once she comes out of this rock bottom hospital visit she'll be set straight.  

I had never been close to an addict before and god is it hard when its someone you come to love like this. The worst thing is thinking about how young she died she was 31. She could have lived to 60 70 hell maybe 80 who knows but she had a lot more time left on this earth and could have made a lot more memories. Her mom is going to have her cremated and she'll send me some of her ashes next week when she comes in.  

This woman became the light of my life. Everything I did was in the future I'd have with her in saving my money, making my decisions etc. The light of my life and gone just like that. If I had to spend everyday of my life taking care of her, cooking for her, cleaning for her you name it I would be happy and fulfilled in this life i'd be like that sterotypical 1950's housewife except as a guy. All I'll have to show for it is a jar of her ashes.",46,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67956144}"

I‚Äôve just come back from a camp get away with new friends I have made throughout my two or so years in recovery.  (Had a minor lapse few months ago thus the ‚Äúsix month‚Äù mark). Anyhow, these friends I went with are great but they normal people in the sense that they can handle their drinks and don‚Äôt have addiction issues. 

So this getaway has just highlighted to me how damn disconnected I still feel from people. In many instances I feel so disconnected that I actually feel as if I have disassociated or that I am like an alien out of this world. 

Another feeling I get is very burnt out, it‚Äôs as if my social gas tank is very small and if I go past that I am actually absolutely exhausted. I noticed I had to have a midday sleep during the camping trip almost every day while others continued doing activities and hanging out with one another because just being near so many people for such extended periods of time was actually hard hard hard work. 

I mean I have always been aware that addiction would lead to emotional and social underdevelopment but it was a really confronting and unavoidable notion this weekend. 

I also feel kind of disillusioned because I know that this feeling of being an alien amongst people, having a small social tank being so socially awkward was the reason I ever picked up back a decade ago and did not put it back down. 

Anyhow I just needed to rant to a group of people who I know might understand.

About me, I had four open abdominal surgeries, 12 hospital stays and basically had norco prescribed to me for a good two years. My last surgery was a hernia removal which was scar tissue from all my other operations. My doctor noted all the norco I had been prescribed and was concerned and wrote me a prescription for tramadol. Which I wouldn‚Äôt  take because I‚Äôve seen friends have seizures from it.  And also because I was already addicted to norco and wanted that, let‚Äôs be frank. 

So basically I got back on the norco and developed a 2 year (in addition) habit. I was taking about 100/120 mgs a day. I started to totally isolate myself and get depressed. My family, which whom I‚Äôm very close, all knew something was up. So finally I had a little meltdown and decided enough is enough. 

I went and saw a doctor who prescribed me suboxone. It‚Äôs been working great and I‚Äôm taking less than she prescribed (4 mg 3x a day was her dose for the first two weeks but it felt like too much) but enough to work as I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on this as well. 

I‚Äôve been down at my parents house for 10 days to chill out, took a little mental health break etc. They all know what I‚Äôm doing and are very relieved and supportive. I am very lucky.

I have some questions though as there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ‚Äúsuboxone for dummies‚Äù book yet:

1. Does suboxone make you tired? I find myself to be fatigued all day. I feel like could just sleep.

2. Does suboxone depress you? I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm depressed or just tired or both.

3. I know I have to ‚Äúre enter‚Äù society soon. Will I be able to function normally? So far I‚Äôve been cool. A little agitated at times but then again I‚Äôve been staying with Family for 10 days üòÇ.

4. I have no desire to take pills at all, whether it be for my pain or the euphoric pain I‚Äôd get first from 1 pill and then from 12. That wasn‚Äôt really a question but I wanted you to know I don‚Äôt feel triggered.

5. Is there a suboxone timeline I can refer to?  Can anyone share any more information I should know???

One day I ran into someone who had cocaine. IV Coke almost killed me a million times but had been away from it for 3 years. I did one shot. 4 weeks later all 10k was emptied and spent on coke that went in my arm. I overdosed on coke several times. I was doing .7 gram shots trying to get the biggest rush without dying that I could, constantly increasing dosage until I was in convulsions unable to hear anything or see anything. My veins are all gone. I was hospitalized 4 times in the last month, I'm getting tests because they think I induced one , if not several, 'cardiac events'. I am 27 years old and went to the gym everyday prior to this. After I emptied my savings, I robbed the drug dealer for 2k worth of cocaine, and jumped off a roof while running away. I have a possibly herniated disc in my lumbar spine, waiting on xray results, and couldn't move for about 3 days after that. I find out next week what the state of my heart and spine is.

I am 9 days clean. I even jumped off 12mg of suboxone/day cold turkey. I have never been so down and low. I tried hanging myself on day 3 and 4. I couldn't get it to work and gave up. Can't even get that right.

I feel like I've had so many chances, but finally blown it. The physical damage to my body is making me want to give up hope. I had a shot at a healthy life without these problems and I feel like I've blown my shot at a decent life. I know I'm catastrophizing. It feels real though. I'm so mentally fucked up and just want to give up, go back out and finish the job. It feels like every other relapse I healed from, but that this one was just the worst one ever, and that I did permanent damage to myself  that I will forever regret.

I dont know. I am going to get back on the wagon. But it's hard right now. I have to do it though. I have slept 6 hours in the past week from the sub withdrawal, been going NUTS. But I will stay clean one day at a time.

I guess I'm posting this hoping someone will say something encouraging. I feel so lost and alone right now. I burned everything in my life to the ground, and it feels like I gave up my health as well. I don't know what the future holds.

Just the other night I met a good friend of mine at a bar and some of our mutual friends made a comment ""we're gonna do a line, be right back."" I had the urge to go with them, but held my ground. 

I fucking miss it. The rush, the euphoria, the incessant jaw-clinching, and above all else, the focus I felt. I feel like I now have much more control over my life than I ever had before, so why not do a little here and there like I used to? 

I know damn well that's the addiction, and I know I would have never gotten as far as I have in school this past semester if I kept using the way I was. I suppose this is a point of where I am struggling now, especially since I am on spring break at my uni and have more free time on my hands. 

Thanks for reading,

Honestly fucking NA is my biggest driving force I don't want to have to face relapsing in front of them and couldn't just lie if I was using again. 

Realistically I know I must fight these urges because it's never a simple relapse for me it always ends in hell. My brain is so powerful though telling me I can enjoy a night off that I've earned a check out from reality because I've done so well. 

Drugs are so accessible and my sobriety is so important to me. I guess I know all the things to say my brain is such a cheeky fucker I really needed to vent somewhere about these cravings I can't make a meeting till mid week.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41952306}"

At 16 I had my first joint and then it went downhill from there. It‚Äôs mostly been weed and alcohol but I‚Äôve had moments with nitrous, coke, H, and too many hallucinogens to count. My lungs have collapsed, my mental health is down the tubes, and I‚Äôve lost so many friends to addiction. I withdrew from my second semester at college to get clean on my own (I was gonna hike the appalachian trail). As was predictable, that didn‚Äôt work and I kept using. One day I was deep into an alcohol bender and I thought ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die like this‚Äù. I called a hotline and they connected me with this establishment in California. I‚Äôm about to get on a plane there now. I want out of addiction, I want to be free, and I‚Äôm willing to work to get there. It‚Äôs literally life or death.
