So, given this newfound self-confidence, I had finally worked up the nerve to ask her out. I mean is that even a thing anymore ? I can honestly say that other than speaking personally, I have never seen some random person asking somebody out. Maybe it makes me kind of a douch? Either way, I’m happy with myself and quitting meth was the best thing I have ever done.

I’ve actually never even been on the site before. I have no idea if I’m doing it right, but I don’t have anybody else to talk to about this. On October 5, I celebrated one year sober from alcohol. I acted like I was happy and proud, but truthfully, I feel worse than I did a year ago.

My physical health has absolutely improved. I used to get horrible acid reflux and stomach pain from the combination of the alcohol and a preexisting issue, which has now almost completely gone away. I’ve lost a lot of weight. I work out three times a week and generally enjoy it. 

My life situation has also improved. I finished my master’s degree and got the job that I wanted right out the gate. I was able to adopt a dog. I go to therapy and am working on my relationship with my family.

I’m also the loneliest I’ve ever been.

I’ve never had a lot of friends, but now I have almost nobody. The only people I interact with regularly are my best friend (also my roommate) and my mom. I like my job, but I work in my own office in a separate building from the rest of the team and rarely see my coworkers. A combination of the pandemic and general business (on both ends) have prevented me from connecting with a lot of my old acquaintances, and those already tenuous relationships have faded.

I’ve tried Meetup several times, but I never seem to have much in common with the people I meet through the groups. I do volunteer work some weekends, but it’s just that: work. There’s not a lot of opportunity to talk to people, and I just wind up tired and burnt out by the time the week starts.

This came to a head today because I was looking for something to do tonight and found a Halloween party at a local lesbian bar. It sounded like fun until I actually thought about it. Am I really going to dress up and go alone to a bar, where everybody else will be not only with their friends/partners, but drinking as well? It just sounds so pathetic. I used to go to bars alone all the time, but it’s not hard to make “friends” when you’re shitfaced. I just can’t face the prospect of doing it both alone AND sober.

When I try to share my frustrations with my friend, she always says that I’m better off now than I was a year ago, and that I’m remembering that time in my life with rose-colored classes. I know that’s true. I was objectively terrible when I was drinking. I was objectively miserable. The problem is that I’m also objectively miserable now; I’m just objectively miserable and trapped in my house with no reliable way to socialize and no way to escape that loneliness. It just feels like I climbed to the top of a mountain expecting a great view but ended up just staring at the side of another mountain. 

TL;DR: What use is being healthy, fit, and sober if I have nobody to share it with?",36,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3664038}"

“Our newly found faith serves as a firm foundation for courage in the future.”

Basic Text, p. 96


Narcotics Anonymous is no place for the faint of heart!  Facing life on life’s terms without the use of drugs isn’t always easy.  Recovery requires more than hard work; it requires a liberal dose of courage.

What is courage, anyway?  A quick look at a dictionary will tell us.  We have courage when we face and deal with anything that we think of as difficult, dangerous, or painful, rather than withdrawing from it.  Courage means being brave; having a purpose; having spirit.  So what is courage, really?  Courage is an attitude, one of perseverance.

That’s what an addict in recovery really needs—perseverance.  We make that commitment to stick with our program, to avoid using, no matter what happens.  A courageous addict is one who doesn’t use, one day at a time, no matter what.

And what gives us courage?  A relationship with a Higher Power gives us the strength and the courage to stay clean.  We know that, so long as we are in our God’s care, we will have the power we need to face life on its own terms.

Just for today: I have a Higher Power who cares for me, no matter what.  Knowing that, I will strive to have an attitude of courage today.

Surrounded by younger kids, I just wanted to fit in, I just wanted a friend or two, a sense of belonging… So I went to a Halloween party, tried keeping up with the guys by taking shots every 5 minutes. Before you know it I’m passed out on the front lawn in an unfamiliar apartment complex… passing out from drinking was so normal to me at that point that apparently everyone who tried waking me up was greeted with my usual “fuck off I’m sleeping.” Even the police. So naturally they did what they’re supposed to do when a drunk girl won’t wake up… they called an ambulance. 

I don’t remember anything from that night other than waking up alone in a hospital bed. There were no doctors or nurses around. I ripped out my IV drip, looked around the room quietly to check if they’d brought any of my belongings with me, grabbed what was mine and walked quickly with my head down toward the nearest exit. I walked home in the dark at around 4am. This wasn’t my first time waking up in the hospital. I don’t remember how many times I’ve been hospitalized from booze, drugs, and failed suicide attempts. I didn’t really want to be alive at that point, so whatever happened to my body during that period of my life really just didn’t fucking matter to me. 

I didn’t get sober for a few more years. 
There are many days where I wonder how I’m still here and where the time went. So many years of my past just wasted…. I was in pain and the only thing I wanted to do to fix it was to just get faded every fucking night. 

In less than 50 days I’ll be 2 years sober. I just recently discovered that I’m pretty good at carving pumpkins. Before I got sober I was always too fucked up to pay attention to one activity for an extended period of time. Tonight I carved a pumpkin, watched hocus pocus, and it was a really nice day.

First of all I'd like to thank all of you.. I've been lurking around a lot this sub and now I decided to make a first post.. small introducion..
 Im an alcoholic and cocaine addict. I'm 27 years old. When I was 14 years old I started smoking a lot of weed and drink a lot of alcohol, I managed that pretty well until I got to the age of about 18 or 19. I discovered cocaine back then and I knew immediately I was hooked. 
At this time, about 8 years later, I wanted to quit so bad.. To be honest I never really got myself into real big trouble, never hit rock bottom I guess (financally, legally.. only my health though (perforated septum)). And after admitting I can't do it alone and reading advices from this sub I decided to go to a CA meeting. It was a game changer for me, I was doing great. After a few meetings I asked a fellow to be my sponsor and he wanted to. I have to admit I made pretty good progress but after 59 days I relapsed. I called my sponsor and he replied ok-ish, we talked about it and I probably didn't do enough to make the program work. I thought about it and I had to be honest to myself that he was right. Indeed I didn't take it that serious. So after that relapse I went to a lot of meetings and I was doing alright.. the thing is, after 61 days again (now) I relapsed again.. I just cant handle the urges and cravings to use after a couple of weeks. But I feel like I can't be honest with my sponsor because I don't want to disappoint him I guess.. And I feel ashamed about getting another newcomer coin at the next meeting I'm attending. I just feel so insecure right now about what I'm going to do next.. 
Just wanted to share this, thanks if you read it all the way trough!

I mean pure hell. Not on the physical side, but mental. I even think one night I had a brief episode of psychosis. Still, I powered through because I know how the brain works, why I was feeling the way I felt. Probably still going through small waves of PAWS from it, but I’m completely functional, have a 4.0 GPA, no temptation to ever go back. Life is way better. I said I would quit and I did. Kratom was far more mentally addictive than any Benzo mentally. I’m not mentally addicted to benzos, just physically. I want off. Of course this has to be done slowly which is frustrating for someone with a mindset of GET ME OFF THIS NOW!!!
However, I joined a subreddit on here for benzo recovery. I haven’t had the same amount of support. The quitting Kratom subreddit was amazing. I’ve talked to a few amazing people on my benzo recovery subreddit, who have all given me hope. But the connotation there is very negative compared to Kratom support. It seemed I was laughed at for talking about how terrible Kratom cold turkey withdrawals were for me. And was told ""Kratom withdrawal is NOTHING compared to benzo withdrawal."" Now let’s put this in perspective. I’m on 30 mg of diazepam which I have been on for over a month, about to go to 25 in a few days. I started tapering in august, where I was on 40 mg for less than a year. I actually jumped from 40 to 35 without telling my former psychiatrist because he wanted to keep me on those bastards. He even suggested suboxone for Kratom withdrawal at week 3 - ridiculous. So I found a new psychiatrist thats happy to reduce me slowly over the course of hopefully 7 months. I’ve had little withdrawal symptoms. Of course 40 to 30 is easy compared to 20 mg to 10, but you get the idea. I’ve had people tell me I’m going too fast, my jump from 40 to 35 to 30 was too quick. I don’t really think so. I listen to my body. I’m ready for my next jump. I click on people who have given negativity or told me I’m going to go through hell. Mind you I was on benzos daily for a year from senior year of high school to early first semester of college, only 0.5 mg of ativan that got switched over to knolopin. These are much more potent than diazepam. I just stopped taking them, had no withdrawal that lasted ""years"". I was probably more depressed, but I was also in a rough spot mentally with starting college. Regardless, the horror stories are valid. I’m not trying to say what people have been through is invalid by any means and I would like to support them. However, I noticed a correlation between those who were more mentally addicted, buying from the streets, and using other drugs besides a benzo (alcohol for the most part). I learned I have to take these stories with a grain of salt. Some people jumped cold turkey off 5 mg of Xanax. Of course you’re going to go through hell. But to say I’m going to have all these terrible symptoms from a long taper of 7 months off 30 mg that I’m on now is disheartening, makes me feel doomed. Everyone’s body is different. Just because someone had a terrible experience coming off of benzos doesn’t mean I will. I had to realize that. And realize I need to take this slowly. Anyways I guess I’m just a little frustrated by horror stories, lack of support (minus a few kind people) and realized maybe Reddit for benzo withdrawal recovery isn’t the place to be. The more I dwell on side effects the worse it’s going to be. Distraction and taking care of yourself is key. I don’t know people with horror stories backgrounds, their mental health status, what other substances they consume, their genetics or age… all of this plays a role. So I’m not sure what to do.",26,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41773117}"

**Basic Text, p. 29**

For many of us, the past is like a bad  dream.  Our lives aren’t the same any more, but we still have fleeting,  highly charged emotional memories of a really uncomfortable past.  The  guilt, fear, and anger that once dominated us may spill into our new  life, complicating our efforts to change and grow.

The Twelve Steps are the formula that helps us  learn to put the past in its place.  Through the Fourth and Fifth Steps,  we become aware that our old behavior didn’t work.  We ask a Higher  Power to relieve us of our shortcomings in the Sixth and Seventh Steps,  and we begin to be relieved of the guilt and fear that plagued us for so  many years.  In the Eighth and Ninth Steps, by making amends, we  demonstrate to others that our lives are changing.  We are no longer  controlled by the past.  Once the past loses its control over us, we are  free to find new ways to live, ways that reflect who we truly are.

**Just for today:** I don’t have to be controlled by my past.  I will live this new day as the new person I am becoming.

Tradition Twelve

“Principles before personalities.”  Many of us chant these words along with the reader whenever the Twelve Traditions are read.  The fact that these words have become a cliche of sorts doesn’t make them any less important, either in service or in our lives.  These words are an affirmation:  “We listen to our conscience and do what’s right, no matter who’s involved.”  And that principle serves as one of the cornerstones of recovery as well as our traditions.

What does “principles before personalities” really mean?  It means we practice honesty, humility, compassion, tolerance, and patience with everyone, whether we like them or not.  Putting principles before personalities teaches us to treat everyone equally.  The Twelfth Step asks us to apply principles in all our affairs; the Twelfth Tradition suggests we apply them to our relations with everyone.

Practicing principles doesn’t stop with our friends or when we leave a meeting.  It’s for every day, for everyone… in all areas of our lives.

Just for today:  I will listen to my conscience and do what’s right.  My focus will be on principles, not on people’s personalities.

**Basic Text, p. 91**

&#x200B;

The further we go in recovery, the less we avoid responsibility for ourselves and our actions.  By applying the principles of the Narcotics Anonymous program, we are able to change our lives.  Our existence takes on new meaning as we accept responsibility and the freedom of choice responsibility implies.  We do not take recovery for granted.

We take responsibility for our recovery by working the Twelve Steps with a sponsor.  We go to meetings regularly and share with the newcomer what was freely given to us: the gift of recovery.  We become involved with our home group and accept responsibility for our part in sharing recovery with the still-suffering addict.  As we learn how to effectively practise spiritual principles in all areas of our lives, the quality of our lives improves.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  Using the spiritual tools I’ve gained in recovery, I am willing and able to make responsible choices.

My life has not been easy, but noone’s is. I did a very good job of playing my roles of single mom, executive, friend, daughter, sister while continuing an addiction to any number of substances, but most importantly, to just not feeling the way I felt. Vidicon, cocaine, weed, alcohol, Xanax, they all had their time and place.

It wasn’t until I was 42 that meth came into my picture. It changed everything. I didn’t really desire any other drugs anymore. During this time. I was losing my identity as my kids were doing exactly what they were supposed to do, be successful and move on. I Destroyed a relationship with the love of my life and I Filled the void of these huge losses with meth.

The past 4 years have been a downward spiral. I went from having a good career and stability to moving from hotel to friend to hotel with no direction anywhere but down. I recently was “caught” by my family and I didn’t lie or try to deny a thing as I had done in the past. I owned up to everything. This was about a month ago. Since then, I have made Some progress seeking the treatment I need but I have also faced some setbacks. I Researched organizations that provide Counseling and assistance and I chose one and signed up for services. I was assigned a counselor and went through an intake process. I was then told that I did not qualify for their services because they only offer outpatient programs and after hearing my story they believed that I require significantly more treatment that they provide. So that didn’t really help me, and in addition they Were nice enough to call CPS to report that My nine-year-old might be At risk because of my drug use. I did not put my daughter Into any more risk than any parent does. They want me to take a drug test Monday that I will not pass. I Still have not decided what I’m going to do about that. So that has caused so much more distress than it helped me at all. It just seems so unfair. 

Despite this, I have been approved for some state funded programs, which look terrible to be honest, And have signed up for private health insurance Which should take affect November 1, allowing me to be covered for some private inpatient treatment.

My question is this: what experiences have you had with rehab? More success with the bare-bones state funded facilities or with the more luxury private operations? Medically assisted or 100% drug free? I need to choose already but I’m terrified and I don’t really have anyone to help me. I don’t believe that Jesus is the solution to my addiction but I am spiritual. I believe that an evidence-based Approach would better suit me. Any input or support you can provide would be helpful.

I had an 8 month long episode of mania so I was taking klonopin along with many other mood stabilizers and anti psychotics - all of which I stopped 5 months ago when my mania finally ended. 🙏🏼 I am now ready to stop taking Klonopin, but am terrified after reading about the effects benzos can have on you when you stop taking them. I had no idea there is a benzo epidemic going on. I thought Klonopin was a harmless pill until I did some research last night. I was on 4 mg of Klonopin for a year, and it barely had any effect on me. It didn’t make me tired, I never craved it, and it definitely didn’t give me a high. It made me a bit lazy and the only reason I took it was to control the mania, cuz it helped with that. I’m terrified about this benzo crisis. I can’t believe people are going through these horrible withdrawals. I am tapering off the klonopin now and my question is will I be ok? I’ve never felt addicted to it or craved it and have never used it for sleep. That’s giving me hope that I won’t experience a bad withdrawal.

I am fairly active in my meetings but have never actively pursued sponsoring people.  I have done the steps myself (edit: I mean I did the steps with my previous sponsor, not that I did the steps by myself!).

My sponsor is very into her lineage, for lack of a better word. I think it's great and have done events with the whole line of people from great grandsponsor down through to me, etc. So her other sponsees have their own sponsees, etc.

She is pushing me to get sponsees.  It's not something I feel comfortable doing.   I mean when I Have been asked for help - a family member, a friend asking me to help someone else - I am right on it, calling, bringing them to meetings, essentially doing 12 step work.  I have no resistance to that. I just don't like the idea of ...being evangelical? ""Looking"" for sponsees? Like some people collect them, like it's a reflection of their own sobriety.

I have gently pushed back on this and said I'm just not in a place for it right now. Maybe later I will change my mind. I am soul searching to figure out what it is about it that makes me uneasy. She is now getting extremely adamant about it - essentially saying if I don't find sponsees to work the steps through them again I am going to jeopardize my own sobriety.  This is causing me a lot of anxiety and guilt. And resentment of course - all bad things for someone in recovery.

Does anyone have any advice for me?  Also I will add that the times I did offer to help people - the most recent time even picking them up, taking them places, being very diligent about following up and also being available to them, it really was a very stressful experience for me because it did cause a lot of disruption as I felt the need to drop everything to help them, and they made it clear they were not interested in 12 step work but enjoyed the social aspect of the meetings.. my instinct was to not push them into the steps right away but encourage them to keep going to meetings to get their feet wet, but my sponsor was suggesting to me that I should be more firm about starting the steps, etc.  This person was not my sponsee, just someone I was trying to guide.  The whole thing left a bitter taste.

I just can't visualize how getting a bunch of sponsees by running out and actively looking for them is going to do anything for me at the moment but add stress. I feel like a sponsee is someone that meets you at a meeting, feels a connection to your sobriety and who you are, and asks for help.

**Basic Text, p. 83**

&#x200B;

Some of us say, “My disease is talking to  me.”  Others say, “My head won’t turn off.”  Still others refer to “the  committee in my mind” or “the monkey on my back.”  Let’s face it.  We  suffer from an incurable malady that continues to affect us, even in  recovery.  Our disease gives us warped information about what’s going on  in our lives.  It tells us not to look at ourselves because what we’ll  see is too scary.  Sometimes it tells us we’re not responsible for  ourselves and our actions; other times, it tells us that everything  wrong with the world is our fault.  Our disease tricks us into trusting  it.

The NA program provides us with many voices  that counter our addiction, voices we can trust.  We can call our  sponsor for a reality check.  We can listen to the voice of an addict  trying to get clean.  The ultimate solution is to work the steps and  draw on the strength of a Higher Power.  That will get us through those  times when “our disease is talking.”

**Just for today:**  I will ignore the “voice” of my addiction.  I will listen to the voice of my program and a Power greater than myself.

I struggle with drinking have done for about ten years. 28f btw. I also go on big drug binges when I’m on a really bad one. Can have three or four day binges. Last week I drank at work and got sent home two days in a row. I have had a bad week. It is for certain. 

My family are really supportive and worried about me. They have a history of alcoholism but so far no one has been as bad as me.

I have had periods of sobriety on my own where my job and my friends and swimming everyday have allowed me to enjoy sobriety without it being a struggle. I find these achievements my most valuable.

The fact that I drank at work last week has really broken my heart. 

After my most recent melt down my parents have called my work and gotten me written off sick for a month and have asked I move back in with them for a month so that I can’t drink. My brother is here with me everyday and my mother (parents divorced) is travelling across Kent everyday to spend time making sure I won’t drink. All day everyday for a month. I can’t be alone in anyway even when I go to the toilet they ask me if I’m okay and I’m not allowed to walk my dogs by myself or go into town in case I drink. 

I am finding it very invasive. And already it’s driving me insane. I am not someone who is very good bumming around the house (I worked full time through lock down and was very grateful for that) 
I don’t want to have these problems and I want to get better but it feels like this is the wrong way to go about it? It feels like no one is acknowledging the fact that these addictions are symptoms of a mental health issue that I struggle with everyday and without my healthy coping mechanisms like work, my friends, swimming I will surely end up resenting the whole thing and be straight back at it all “angry and bitter” the moment I’ve convinced them they’ve listened to my wee enough times that I am healed and therefore allowed out on my own.


I am really interested to hear anyone’s thoughts? Sorry about the ramble. I am struggling so much as I know that what they are doing is just out of love and I am so lucky to have parents and a family that are willing to try and help me so much. I am angry with myself for this reaction but can’t ignore how I feel about it. I feel like this is a counterintuitive homemade kind of “”vigilante rehab arrangement””.  And it is gonna back fire and I would like some advice on how I can maybe talk with them so they might understand where I’m coming from….

Over the last few months I've leant my partner x amount of cash for needed things which at first was what the money was being spent on, over time shes began to struggle to pay the money back and I've found out she's been gambling in excess of £1000 a month. It hit a hard point for me this week when I had already leant her £185 to for essentials due to her payments from work being staggered I recently learnt she has been moving hundreds of pounds from my bank to hers gambling and I don't know what to do. This year's been quite hard for myself as I work in care and spent large majority of time working on covid positive houses putting in silly hours - this is in part to invest and save and to take care of bills, family and her - everything I'm saving is being blown away and I'm being left struggling to make ends meet. By mid month this month I'm already left with £0 and she's had excess of £300 off of me (that I'm aware of). I'm currently working a 15hr shift and am hiding the fact I can't afford food for lunch etc from fellow workers. I'm begining to struggle mentally with it all and feel like my life isn't ever going to move forward. I've been very calm and content about it as she is my partner, she knows her self that if it was anybody else other than her or a family member I would've resorted to other means and been a horrible bastard to the person who did it.

I feel like I've ruined my entire adult life. Severe cognitive decline and social anxiety.,"I (19M) started smoking weed when I was 16 in year 10 of high school. When year 11 rolled around I started having hypomanic episodes, dissociating and cycling extreme moods. Since then it's all been a rollercoaster. I continued to smoke to cope with these feelings. Things kept getting more extreme. I would get sent into a state of pure joy and confidence but I would become someone I don't recognise. Then I would crash and be lethargic, depressed and dissociated. It has been never ending. 

Things have gotten better and worse. I have noticed a severe cognitive decline as I smoked more and more. My manic state would temporarily fix this and I was fooled into believing that when I felt this energy and joy that it was how I was supposed to feel and craved it constantly. 

I'm high right now typing this. I just relapsed 3 weeks ago after 4.5 months of sobriety. At the beginning of the year my smoking got to a point where I could no longer feel the same manic energy and joy that I had previously felt and after a near suicide attempt the reality of life set in and I was feeling prepared to let my mind recover. My hope was slowly diminished as a severe cognitive decline set in. My memory and focus have completely left me and continue to get worse. I struggle to think. Anxiety fills me everyday and there's no room to think. I can't process the world around me anymore. It feels like all the good qualities I had before I smoked have completely faded into dust. I obsess all day about how fucked I am and how I don't have the control to do the most basic shit like cleaning and conversating. I struggle to conversate at all nowadays.

I'm lost on what to do at this point. I've been doing cycling everyday since and it has become a chore but I'm afraid if I lose that habit I'll have nothing to live for. My brain is not recovering in sobriety. If anything it feels like it's deteriorating at a faster rate. Time is flying by and I can't remember anything.

A member who is a physician described  his unwillingness to identify at his first meeting by refusing to go  into “that room full of junkies.”  Another member with an extensive  background in jails and institutions shared a similar story, except that  her shock and surprise stemmed from the realization that “there were  nice people there—wearing suits, yet!”  These two friends recently  celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary.

The most unlikely people form  friendships, sponsor each other, and do service work together.  We meet  in the rooms of recovery together, sharing the bonds of past suffering  and hope for the future.  We meet on mutual ground with our focus on the  two things we all have in common—addiction and recovery.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  No matter what my personal circumstances, I belong

I am staying in touch with her, not cutting her off completely. I would like to get in touch with people who have walked that path before and are now recovering. I would like you to share your experiences, ask you questions, etc. so that I gain better understanding of her situation. Actually, I really have no friend to talk about it, let alone knowing someone who is recovering. I hope you would be comfortable in talking about your experiences. I will try to not be a pesky rat!

It wasn’t a serious addiction as I would take something 1 or 2 times a week, but I have been having these weird heart pains, so I’m stopping until I can get into the doctor and get my heart checked (for a second time). I went before and got an EKG, no issues there besides that my heart was racing the whole time, I think this was just anxiety though. 
Yesterday I woke up feeling good. Something felt so right, i am so used to the feelings that these drugs give me that I had forgotten how it feels to be sober with a clear mind. It felt good yesterday. I prayed that the feeling would last, as it gives me motivation to keep going, makes me feel in control, but it didn’t stick. 
 It’s been hard, I’ve been trying to quit for this reason for almost a year, but the will to take the painkillers has always been stronger, especially since they help me feel much less anxious and self conscious in social situations.
I have read up a lot on how painkillers can affect your heart beat and your heart’s general health, which has just made me more anxious. 
When I pop, I feel fine while I’m high. But afterward I get these sharp pains in my heart area. It has made it so that I am afraid to even pop half, as my heart starts hurting. 
This could be 100% anxiety, but is it really worth it to take the chance?
I am going to my doctor ASAP but I cannot tell her about the pks . Anyone have any advice?

It’s my birthday and I finally settled on going to dinner with a girlfriend. Just getting myself to get dressed and book the table was difficult enough but then she made it clear she wanted to go to one of her registered dancing courses after. “You don’t mind right?”..

I cancelled everything.

It’s hard enough going anywhere at this point. Especially just for an hour dinner. I have no idea what life is supposed to be like without hedonism. All I know is cocktails, restaurants, spending obscene money, sex and popping Xanax. The only socialising I had was with other people that subsisted off drinking and going out. Going to this stupid restaurant to order a salad, sit there missing my cocktails and being mad at breaking my fast - with someone who i realise has become a fair weather friend (my fault because i neglected her constantly to party and for that months sex toy boyfriend) IS INFURIATING.

I get I’m supposed to be building a new life. I get it’s my birthday and i should celebrate myself. But I’m miserable today. I feel so ashamed for feeling this way.

I want to take my makeup off and shut off my phone for a week and turn on Netflix.

This shame and pent up annoyance and wanting to cry has me running the tape of going to my favourite fancy hotel bar and ordering a martini. Going home with some asshole. Hating myself tomorrow. It’s like I’m craving an emptiness emotional bandaid. I’m probably going to take a few Antabuse to just squash that possibility.

Just a few months prior our house had been raided, dope sniffing dogs, sheriff's in task force gear busted through our door at 7am. If they would have shown up just a few hours earlier, they would have found over a pound of meth, wanted gang members with guns and it probably would have been a mess.

There were 6 of us living there: me, my fiancé and our 2 year old daughter, our roommate and his girlfriend and their 10 month old daughter. We were cooking dope, had very dangerous people involved in our lives, guns were a regular sight at our house. We were Bellflower tweakers and a couple of the largest dealers in town. We were a disaster.

I went to jail, roommate went to prison. When I got out I had lost everything: we lost custody of our daughter, my fiancé had left me and I lost the house. I was back on the streets, with two grocery bags full of all my worldly possessions. On October 15th, 1998 I was facing a crossroads, either get clean, or I was going to die out there on the streets. I made a call that day and got into a 1 year Christian recovery program. On the way to the program I stopped by where my ex-fiancé was staying and told here I was going to get our daughter back and what program I was going to and I walked away. I rededicated my life to God, went to 90 meetings in 90 days, started going to 2-3 meetings a week, 6 months of drug and alcohol counseling . 6 months into the program, my ex called the home and I just so happened to be answering phones. She said she was ready to get clean. We got her into a program that day.

She stayed 6 months and went to live with her sister and wait for me. I ended up staying 19 months at a 1 year program (I was in a safe place, I needed to be 100% ready). When I left the program I had a full time job, an apartment and a pretty used car. On March 10th, 2001 we were married and our then 5 year old daughter was the prettiest flower girl you you have ever seen! Shortly after that we had full custody!

Flash forward to today, my wife and I both serve in Celebrate Recovery, we've been there for 13 years. I'm the Ministry Leader for the program, and also serve as California State Representative for Celebrate Recovery. We both also have full time jobs. My wife is on the TEAM as one of our encouraging coaches. We both lead step studies, small groups, etc. Our daughter, who is 25, still lives with us and recently celebrated 6 years sobriety from self-harm. God turned this washed up, 4 time felon, hopeless dope addict into a dopeless HOPE addict! WE DO RECOVER!!! It's all about giving back.

Fuck, teaching is hard. I’ve seen every teacher’s take on it. It is truly because they have kept all the pandemic expectations and ADDED all the prepandemic expectations. We are expected to do it all. Kids are feeling because school is hard and they’re expected to perform and grow academically while inside - nothing makes sense. They literally don’t know how to school. They’re in 7th grade and expected to do 7th grade bullshit without having learned all the things in 5th and 6th grade. We’ve missed the mark on this in education. I’m going to continue to focus on love, self worth and kindness as my goals in education, and if they get some math in there - great! I’m going to focus on not working 6 days a week and try to get my work weeks back to 45 hours instead of 55-60. I’m going to reappear in my friends’ lives and offer support. I’m going to reconnect in meetings and remember that is for community and not necessarily sobriety support. 

So many friends think, “Good for her. She doesn’t drink.” Instead of “Is alcohol the best decision for me?” Does it help anxiety - no. Episode 22 of Sober Powered. Is one drink harmless - no. 3 drinks a week ups your chance of getting breast cancer by 15%. It’s the equivalent of smoking 5 cigarettes at a time. And a lot of women I know think it’s a victory when they don’t finish a bottle of wine in one night. How many drinks a week are you consuming? Is it worth the risk? It is such a huge lie. I wish the lie was exposed and people would hear me without thinking, “Oh. That’s only true for her because she had a problem.” According to a classic definition, I was on my way to having a problem. I was on the spectrum for sure. Where are you on the spectrum? The pandemic is not ending. Are you still drinking like you have a free pass because it’s an epidemic? Binge drinking is waaay up for 20-30 year olds. So is metastatic breast cancer. All the data is from 2017 and before. They haven’t compiled the data for the last five years. It is going to be bleak when they do.

About my brother: 

He has been an addict for over 15 years (Meth and other drugs). He’s Schizophrenic and takes his meds but they don’t work because he’s using. 

His rage, delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, etc have been dangerous and terrifying. 

He’s been homeless, in and out of jail, and he’s a felon.

He’s been to rehab 2x.

I know what he is like when he is well, and he’s awesome. I love him with all of my heart. It *kills* me to see him suffering. I worry about him every day.

What can I do to help him without enabling him?

Is it necessary to cut ties? 

Do I enable him when I give him a ride to get his psych meds? 

Or when I bring him food? 

Is it enabling if I talk to him on the phone when he’s obviously high? 

It’s so hard to know where to draw the line.  Especially because we lost our dad and he’s taking it so hard.

Their car is old and scratched up by life in general, and they don't want to get the scratches fixed. The furniture stains can't be fixed because they were unfinished (bare wood). My partner declined my offer to give them a lump sum of money, stating that they want it to be something that doesn't feel punitive (them taking money from me) and instead want it to feel generative but relevant (e.g. perhaps I could pay for something that would benefit both of us but would be directly related to the damage done?).

They do not want any furniture or car-related things right now. I suggested contributing to a furniture fund or car fund that they could use in the future, and that in the long run would benefit me too if we stay together, but they declined. 

I feel stuck. I need to make amends somehow (they have expressed wanting this). I think my feeling of stuckness might be getting in the way of my creative thinking.

Summer 2020. It was fraught with anxiety because as a teacher, I had no idea what the fall was going to look like. I got yanked around with so many possible scenarios that I could barely sleep at night. I know I was drinking more because of it being the pandemic. Beer:30 kept happening earlier and earlier. I was remembering less and less every morning. We had upped my anxiety meds and it wasn’t working. My stomach was in knots all the time. I did what last night? I only had four drinks what the hell! The start of the year was coming at me fast. I wasn’t holding it all together anymore. My son and my daughter both knew that I was drinking too much. So on August 11, seven days before school started, I stopped drinking. It took till probably around day 100 for my anxiety to be better. I had no idea alcohol is gasoline to anxiety. If you are struggling with any mental health issues, stop drinking. Western medicine is too scared of the big alcohol industry and their own drinking to come out and say alcohol is not good for mental health. It’s the same level carcinogen as asbestos in formaldehyde. Big Pharma and alcohol want to keep us sick. More anxiety meds. More supplements. But keep on drinking. Yoga and wine. Have you ever seen the peloton rides with alcohol? Alcohol is worse than smoking as far as cancer is concerned. I’m begging you to please, please stop drinking. Trust the last 14 months of my sobriety. I went after my trauma. I made it to 30 days and I knew I was hanging on by a thread. I hired an addiction coach to get me through the next 30. I hired a counselor. My friend said your childhood does not sound normal. I went to my counselor and he was like, “Cathy, that’s fucked up!” I faced my relational trauma and realized I deserved more than what I had. I didn’t need someone who would tolerate and accept me. I needed someone who would love and celebrate me. I began the next eight months by myself. And then I met this most amazing man who loves me and sees me for all that I am and says, “Yes! I want her.” The universe had to clear out all the people who didn’t love me and see me for me. Making room for all these wonderful friends and a new chosen family.

I was half expecting to get bashed so thank you for being kind to me when I feel so low. This is the hardest time of day for me without my kids. So lonely without them.

I'm a single mom. I am also a recovering drug addict. I would occasionally use methamphetamine and be high whilst in the presence of my children. 

In spite of that, all agree that I'm a good parent. My kids knew they were loved, they never wanted for anything even though I'm poor, and I would try my best to make our time together fun. I do that now, only I don't get to see my oldest since i have to pay $25 an hour for supervised visitation and no jobs are calling me back. My youngest I see once a week, again for supervised visits which is paid for by CYS (CYF; DHFS).  I get two hours a week with my youngest.

I don't want to get into details but I did something stupid and ended up in jail for two months. I lost my kids after it had been them and me for seven years straight. I had no help and didn't trust sitters so I didn't go out and i never had anyone over here, for safety reasons. I made that sacrifice for my kids and i was happy to do it because I love them. 

Jail wasn't so bad. What's hurt is being separated from my kids and i mean that from the bottom of my soul. I keep my house immaculate now and that should be a good thing but I'd rather my kids were here to mess it up again. I would dwell on all the times I didn't play with my kids when they asked, while I was in jail. I regret not doing more with them even though I was always doing stuff for and with them.

I realized I never thought I would actually see consequences for using because I was such a small user. That's what I told myself. I realized I never thought I would lose my kids. But I did. I'm still looking at jail time at sentencing, now I'm out on bond. I walk around with a guilty feeling in my stomach. I try to keep busy so as not to think about it but once I'm out of things to do and it's evening, the ache in my stomach comes back full force and I sit for two to three hours, feeling sorry for myself until I go to bed trying to block the thoughts that creep in. 

If you're a parent, be smarter than me. Don't take your kids or your freedom for granted and get clean. One small dumb choice could take them away from you and there's nothing you can do to stop it once the consequences come.",47,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43527243}"

General idea being something like:  
First use > Recreational use > Heavy use > Addiction > Dependency > Rock Bottom > Getting Help aka 12 step program > Recovery  


I mean I probably overlooked a few steps, but every recovery story I've heard seems to hit the same sort of milestones. Almost makes me wonder if it's some sort of fated process that every addict has to go through at one point or another.  
If that's true, then at this point, my next stop is ""Rock Bottom"" and there's nothing I can do about it. Even if I were to quit cold turkey and attempt to brute force recovery, I'm merely a relapse waiting to happen? After all, I'm not the first addict to describe themselves as ""the type that has to learn the hard way"".  


So what do you think? Am I truly prematurely self-aware of some compelling natural force and am powerless to do anything but let the recovery process unfold in it's own due time? Having to learn the hard way means I have to cross that threshold sooner or later, otherwise I'll never truly get clean for good?  
Or is it merely a case of mental gymnastics to rationalize putting off what deep down I know is necessary? An excuse to rationalize not acting when I realized I should be?  


Figured I can't be sure either way, why not ask those with more experience in the process.

I am new in this particular subreddit and have a question about happiness that has robbed me of recent peace of mind. This question is how do you or did you achieve some sentiment of happiness in your lives after becoming sober? Achieving some form of happiness is by far the most difficult part on my road to recovery that I have experienced and one issue that I have not yet been able to resolve, I'd like to share about myself briefly so you have some background on me.

I am an addict who started using at around 12 or 13 years old and just entered my late 20's. I have always been someone who is noticeably depressed and has a profoundly apathetic view on life. I do not have many interests and when I wasn't out partying I spent much of my life studying in order to improve my cognitive abilities, understanding of the world, and comprehend what the point of our existence is. While these are rather deep topics worth endless debate, the only reasonable conclusion that I could reach about our purpose is to be happy, to enjoy life, and to do what you want. For many years I attempted to achieve this through partying and drug use with what few friends I have ever made. This was not entirely fruitful. I have used pretty much constantly since I was an early teen and eventually settled on my DOC combo of a heroin and crack IV speedball as a mid to late teen. 

I am not much of a social person, and never really have been. I do not make friends easily and am very easily irritated by others due to how angry I can become at minor things. This is something I have improved upon through working directly with medical professionals over the years, but I would still say I have a serious temper. They (doctors) have claimed I seem have a serious lack of empathy. Some people refer to me as an asshole, but I just do not see pleasantries as necessary and prefer the truth regardless of how harsh is it. I often do not seek out new friendships and after multiple moves I am left with nearly zero friends I actually interact with in person. I am a pessimist and always have been. Pessimism is another thing I have seriously improved upon, although I find it very difficult to remove this mindset entirely. I have no belief in a spiritual power such as religion due to being raised atheist and ingrained with a strong belief in science. I consider my fellow addicts in recovery to be my ""higher power"". I do not have much direction in life at all and have just wanted to achieve some form of contentment.

As far as happiness goes, I have been told it comes after a significant period of time in recovery while being sober and I also understand that life will never always be happy, sunshine, and roses.. That  make sense to me and I am at peace with it. I myself am approaching one year soon (something I consider to be a worthy accomplishment but not a long time) and while I don't expect to be some fountain of joy that exudes happiness to all around, I still notice I do not find life to be worth living at all (No, I am not suicidal. I just genuinely do not see how people consider life to be worth living when it sucks 97% of the time). I have been told to ""Fake it until you make it!"" which has never seemed to work in any of the situations I have ever tried to apply it to in life. That being said, I have been maintaining that attitude as a way to calm those around me so they do not worry about my mental condition; their overreaction (immediately jumping to the conclusion I plan to kill myself, which is FALSE) usually leads to some sort of outcome that negatively impacts my current place in recovery. I'll conclude my background rant there.

Does anyone else not find happiness in much of anything? Is it always fleeting? Does anyone have the same experience and/or a story about how they over came something similar? Is the concept of ""fake it until you make it"" actually applicable here and/or worth applying? Any advice or experience is worth sharing and would be greatly appreciated!

My husband’s ex-wife is currently going through the steps, and claims that she has completed them and has become a sponsor. However, she never made any effort to make amends to our family, and when asked, she said she was making living amends because she didn’t have to make direct amends if it would hurt somebody, and it would hurt her. 

In all the research I did, it said direct amends are best unless it hurts the person you’re making amends to. It would not hurt us at all, she knows it, and we were looking forward to finally having an honest conversation with her. She definitely knows that amends are needed at the very least to the kids that she abandoned due to her addiction. 

Am I just completely misunderstanding what it means to make amends? I thought an apology is supposed to “hurt” the person making it, that’s the entire point of admitting you did something wrong and you feel sorry for it.

I’m not sure if you have watched it, but the Morning Show debuted on Apple TV in 2019 with its take on Me too and Matt Lauer. Everything was presented as having already happened, but a flashback scene unleashed a wave of being seen I never had in my life. In the show, a worker as a junior booker position all of a sudden catches the eye of the King of TMS. Then they end up on remote at the Las Vegas shooting back in 2017 I think. The emotionality of that moment and starkness of covering such a heinous tragedy forged a connection,.how people can form intense bonds when in such an emotional event. Then an innocent movie and what she thought was a paternal hug turned into an assault and her shock at, “Is this really happening?” rendered her silent as the events unfolded. She left and numbly went through the rest of the trip mortified that had happened. Once she returned to work, Steve Carell’s character ignored her and completely dismissed her. She fell apart and went to the head of the network and told him what happened, and he turned it around and promoted her. She asked through shock and instead tears, “So, is this how it works?” And he responded, “Sure. Smart hardworking people get promoted all the time.” 

For the first time in my life, I saw what happened to me portrayed on anything. How one person can be shocked by the events to a point of silence after their protest of no go on unheard. How I shut down. It happened once in college by a fellow student and once by a person of trust. And they  began my numbing chase to be perfect and to not let it break me. I found out women respond either to the point of being numb or hyper sexualized. I began my quest with men because I was now going to be in control of how and when my body is pet of something. I trusted no one.I told no one because I couldn’t handle the repeated trauma of being not heard or supported by my parents.  

The character also became very successful and used substances. Where her life ended in a relatively short time, my path with substances and using sex to numb lasted for the next 28 years. 28 years! 

This goes back to what I have said in most of my sobriety - alcohol use disorder is a trauma response. If you don’t think so, you haven’t uncovered the trauma yet. The need to numb and escape comes from something primal that was harmed or not acknowledged. If you’re looking to stay sober, go after the trauma. Go deep. Get support. Keep working at it. Sending you so much love. I hope sharing my truths helps someone else to give voice to their trauma. We do recover.",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4891071}"

Would using these be considered getting high and breaking my sobriety? They don’t induce anything in waking hours besides some sedation, which plenty of night-time teas they sell at Walmart do anyway. I’m curious to try this but someone on Reddit just told me I’m not sober anymore if I’ve recently used mugwort, and it’s fucking with my head cause I tried it.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.575773}"

I must say I miss opiates all the time. They were definitely my drug of choice. I still have a collection that I keep for just comfort reasons I suppose. I've quit a few times in the past but nothing lasting as long as a year since I started taking prescription opiates in 2007. I never did H, was around it but knew with my love of opiates I would grow to love it sooo much that I didn't want to go down that path of problems. Always been strong willed like that with certain things. They never messed up my professional life and I actually succeeded at a lot while going through the depths of my addiction. My personal life however, is about half way good to go. I often wonder how life would have been if I never got in the car wreck back then that introduced me to opiates. I wonder how my relationships would be with friends, how would they be romantically? Would I be married now? Girlfriend? Would I have kids now? Lots of asking the 'why' question these days.

Kratom served its purpose with helping me get off prescription opiates, however, I simply replaced them with Kratom and it became my new normal. Better from the alternatives I suppose. If used correctly I still believe Kratom to be a good and helpful plant. It has in the last few years gotten a little to commercialized for my taste though. It took me from having a habit where I had to snort 1x-2x Roxi 30mg and pop another couple to just get out of bed in the morning. Then proceeded to whatever other opiate pill I had on hand throughout the day along with many other substances. I’m definitely a poly-substance abuser when it comes to drugs. I tried quitting with Kratom in the past but kept going back to pills after a while. Mainly because well let's be honest they are better in the recreationally but really because they were easily accessible. This was back when pills were what they were supposed to be. Fentanyl was never a thing like it is today. Sure, I came across the patches here and there but never to the extent that pills have gotten today. Crazy that today you have to watch out for Fentanyl because it’s literally in EVERYTHING. Really thankful that if I was going to go down the path I did I was able to during a time where I didn’t have to be worried about what I was doing so much like kids have to be today. Another major thing was that I had a job where I was making so much money that it never hurt my finances. I am a functional addict and that sometimes can be a lot worse because you don't see how bad off you are really. 

I still have several substance issues to work on (another story for another day unless you really want to know) but opiates were a huge part of my drug problem. I consider it a big win and hope to look back at this and say it's been two years next year this time. 

To those who are in need of hope, encouragement, have questions or just need to chat feel free to hit me up. I am happy to assist others along in their journey to quit.",48,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45589438}"

Struggling with…everything,"I've been an opiate user for almost 20 years, but the last 4 years of daily use & switching to heroin/fent is what did me in. I let my life unravel around me. Hell I gave away everything in my life that I had built(relationships, material things, every bit of finances) just to continue my selfish use and stay well. I'm usually not a pity party but dont have many people to vent to. Life just kinda feels shitty right now. I'm only on day 52 of sobriety and already feel stagnant and lost. I was in treatment for 46 of those days and my life pretty much turned to shit the moment I got out. Got hit with divorce papers on my way to the airport back home being the biggest kick in the ass. I don't blame her. I put her through years of watching me slowly become a shell of the man she married, she tried countless times to get me help and finally surrendered. Im a big risk at this point. I've always relapsed and gone further down my hole lately. I stopped being a husband and she became like a caregiver. Thats no way to live regardless of how much you love someone. 

But now that I feel so goddamn low, alone & literally trying to reset almost everything in my life, I question if I even want to stay in sobriety. I dont ever want to go back to opiates, but smoking weed/drinking has been on my mind just to be able to socialize with friends & other people. I've hit meetings since I've been back and they dont really seem to help me. It's connection I'm lacking. A purpose in life im lacking. Even spirituality im lacking. 

I have no motivation like I did recently to do much of anything. Haven't even gone back to work yet, barley been working out. I just drive around listening to music and smoking cigs. I literally had to move back to my parents house after being out for over 10 years since I'm financially fucked and cant afford my own place. Thinking about moving in with my buddy who supports my recovery but hes a ""normie"" and im not sure how that will influence me. Its gotta be better then stuck in an upstairs room at my parents while my pops drinks himself till passed out at the table every night. It's just too easy to isolate here.

I'm new to recovery (tomorrow will be 4 months) and I am struggling with lots of emotions and feeling a little lost. I was smoking cannabis (the really high quality shit) for about 2.5 years and was a heavy smoker. I would smoke just about every 3 hours when I was awake and then hit it again as soon as I woke up. There wasn't a time when I wasn't high. This was all ontop of taking a high dose of Lexapro (20mg). Finally, at the end of May, I had a nervous breakdown caused by excessive use of weed. My first response was to smoke more weed. That made it so much worse and I ended up developing a hand tremor and permanent chills. So I quit. Cold turkey.

It was a nightmare. The first three weeks I was terrified to be alone. I felt like I was going to die; I had nausea, sweating, chills, monophobia...all of it. Anyone who says weed isn't addictive is lying to you. I had changed my brain chemistry so much that my brain was in free-fall. Not only had I used weed, but I had used it while on Lexapro (an SSRI) which alters your brain chemistry, as well. I suddenly had ZERO balance in my brain.

But I got through it...more or less.

Now I am 4 months out and experiencing extreme mood issues--anxiety and depression in the morning, lasting until the evening when I begin to feel a little more normal. I have worked really hard not to use again because I know I don't want to do the withdrawals again (good god, no) but it has been EXTREMELY hard not to reach for something else. I am sober from alcohol, as well, and quit coffee (because it made my anxiety worse). 

I was reading about something called Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome and I am wondering if thats what I am experiencing. Does anyone else have a similar experience (or any advice) for someone in the early months or recovery. Sometimes the feelings get so bad and heavy that it feels like it will never end; like I've fucked up my brain permanently. 

Note: I have a therapist who specializes in addiction, so I have that support. I am just looking for any personal experiences that people want to share. Thanks!",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8151129}"

**Basic Text, p. 105**

&#x200B;

Addiction and self-will go hand in  hand.  The unmanageability that we admitted to in Step One was as much a  product of our self-will as it was of our chronic drug abuse.  And  today, living on self-will can make our lives just as unmanageable as  they were when we were using.  When our ideas, our desires, our demands  take first place in our lives, we find ourselves in constant conflict  with everyone and everything around us.

Self-will reflects our reliance on  ego.  The only thing that will free us from self-will and the conflict  it generates in our lives is to break our reliance on ego, coming to  rely instead on the guidance and power offered us by a loving God.

We are taught to consult spiritual  principles, not our selfish desires, in making our decisions.  We are  taught to seek guidance from a Higher Power, one with a larger vision of  things than our own.  In doing this, we find our lives meshing more and  more easily with the order of things around us.  No longer do we  exclude ourselves from the flow of life; we become a part of it, and  discover the fullness of what recovery has to offer.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  I seek  freedom from ego and the conflicts generated by self-will.  I will try  to improve my conscious contact with the God of my understanding,  seeking the guidance and power I need to live in harmony with my world.

**Basic Text, p. 46**

&#x200B;

There are two parts to recovery: getting  clean, and staying clean.  Getting clean is comparatively easy because  we only have to do it once.  Staying clean is more difficult, requiring  attention every day of our lives.  Yet both draw their power from faith.

We got clean on faith.  We admitted that  addiction was more powerful than we were, and we stopped trying to fight  it on our own.  We turned the battle over to a Power greater than  ourselves, and that Higher Power got us clean.

We stay clean each day the same way: on  faith.  Just for today, we surrender.  Life may be too big for us to  tackle on our own power.  When it is, we seek a Power greater than  ourselves.  We pray, asking our Higher Power for direction and the  strength to follow it.  By exercising and renewing our faith on a daily  basis, we tap the resources we need to live clean, full lives.

There is limitless strength available to us  whenever we need it.  To grasp it, all we need to do is keep faith in  the Higher Power that got us clean and keeps us clean.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:**  Faith got me clean,  and faith will keep me clean.  Today, I will keep faith with my Higher  Power.  I will renew my surrender and pray for knowledge and strength.

**Basic Text, p. 30**

&#x200B;

“Pain—who needs it!” we think whenever we’re in  it.  We see no good purpose for pain.  It seems to be a pointless  exercise in suffering.  If someone happens to mention spiritual growth  to us while we’re in pain, we most likely snort in disgust and walk  away, thinking we’ve never encountered a more insensitive person.

But what if human beings didn’t feel  pain—either physical or emotional?  Sound like an ideal world?  Not  really.  If we weren’t capable of feeling physical pain, we wouldn’t  know when to blink foreign particles out of our eyes; we wouldn’t know  when to stop exercising; we wouldn’t even know when to roll over in our  sleep.  We would simply abuse ourselves for lack of a natural warning  system.

The same holds true for emotional pain.  How  would we have known that our lives had become unmanageable if we hadn’t  been in pain?  Just like physical pain, emotional pain lets us know when  to stop doing something that hurts.

But pain is not only a motivating  factor.  Emotional pain provides a basis for comparison when we are  joyful.  We couldn’t appreciate joy without knowing pain.

&#x200B;

**Just for today:** I will accept pain as a necessary part of life.  I know that to whatever level I can feel pain, I can also feel joy.
