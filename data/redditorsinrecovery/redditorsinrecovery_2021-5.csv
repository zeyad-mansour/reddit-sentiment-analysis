2021-05-30 13:53:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/noghve/1st_year_teaching_sober/,1st year teaching sober,"So, I just finished my first sober school year teaching! I started this journey 7 days before school started. In that moment and those days leading up to the start of the school year, everything felt so heavy. I did not know how I was going to make it - much less stay sober the whole school year. Then the magic happened. I got covid and I rested and rehabilitated and began my real recovery with community (TLC and Sober Mom Squad) I learned that alcohol contributed to my anxiety, not managed it. It crippled my body's response to anxiety. That is when I knew I would never drink again. 

Guess what? After the beginning part of sobriety that was hell, teaching got easier! No shit! It got easier. I was better. I was authentic in my response to kids AND in my reception of their actions and words. I was no longer putting my spin on what they were saying. I was hearing them for what they were saying. WOW! Who knew that is what sobriety was giving me? 

I know this sounds crazy, but this was my best year teaching! This is when I didn't have that difficult class that I dreaded everyday! I enjoyed every kid. I didn't have kids that got amped up about in a bad way. We had 500 first days this year, and I never was there for any of them because of Covid and my surgery. I never got to set my classroom up the way I wanted and it still was mazing! I can't imagine what this next year will be like. 

Take time to heal this summer. Take time to understand who you are in recovery. Read Untamed. Listen to her podcast. Examine your hot spots that bug the fuck out of you. Learn why that is more about you and not them. Don't demonize kids because of your trauma. Heal yourself so you can be there for kids. I'll say this - teachers in recovery from trauma or substances bring something else to the table others don't have. I know this year was easier on me mentally because I am in recovery. Shit did not get to me unless it was big - student's mom dying, student incurring a traumatic brain injury. Those are supposed to rock me. Students being a dick? Not so much. I was able to get at the reasons why and respond to the need, not the behavior. I've known this logic for 11 years and now I am actually doing it because I am healing from my trauma. My need to be seen and heard is being met in other ways so I am not longer looking for that from students. There's the key! Students are no longer responsible for my well being. I am. There's the secret of this year. And I challenge you as a teacher or a mom to learn to provide your own mental health wellness rather than finding that in your students or children. I know it has made all the difference in my life.

This school year sober is a bigger milestone to me than any of the others I have a achieved, and I would assert that it is bigger than a year will be to me. My life has been defined by the school calendar for as long as I can remember. It makes sense why this is hitting me different. I taught an entire school year sober. I achieved success like I never have before as a teacher. I am happier than I ever have been and my children are no longer responsible for my well being. They are allowed to just be my children or my students. And, that is a beautiful thing! 

If you are just starting on this sober journey, the first week, the first month, the first 90 days lie to you! It does get better. It does get easier. It no longer is a thought I have to just get through this day sober. It is more about situations when they come up. I will get through this end of year celebration sober. (I didn't go to the planned one and I was surprised by the impromptu one and I didn't drink.) I will watch these playoff games at bars sober (Nuggets are tied in the first round and Avs are just starting the second round.) I will continue to fight for my healing. I have saved $8700 and spent all of it on my recovery. No regret whatsoever. Emotion Code is a huge component of my recovery and I recommend it to any of you. It is a total game changer!",51,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38435176}"

I’m certainly feeling much better. My acute symptoms seem to have pretty much passed at this point, but my stomach still is constantly gurgly and I feel like I ran a marathon after every time I get up and do anything. 

Honestly, the best thing I’ve done for myself during this time was go to work. The weekends and days off are fucking brutality for me. I have an 18 month old, so it is somehow MORE draining to be home than running around as a nurse all day. As tempting as it is to say “I’ll just stay home for 2-4 weeks and withdraw”, I think I would’ve cracked for sure. Keep yourself busy once you’re past the very worst of the acutes, or you’ll just sit and think about how miserable these tiny symptoms are. While I normally would’ve been ecstatic about a 3 day weekend like this one, I’m definitely not this time! Sitting around at home all day makes the days pass unbearably slowly.

But now that I’ve gotten the bitching out of the way - there’s a lot to be grateful for here too. I’m starting to see some hints of the “old me” shining through. I think I’d forgotten how much I loved talking to people. The subs really made me feel numb and uninterested in a lot of things.

I don't want to go back to being in full blown addiction, I was miserable. Since getting off meth my life has definitely improved but I'm still not happy. I know that if I keep letting slip ups happen I will be back to where I was a year ago in no time but there's a part of me that just doesn't care. I don't know if that's the right way to describe it but I just feel like it should be so simple, if I don't want to be an addict again why am I going back to it? 

In a way I feel like I'm back to when I very first started using and would lie to myself saying ""this is the last time I'm doing this, I'm not going to become addicted to meth"". I should know better this time around though, it doesn't work like that. There's always 'one more time' and I have had 4 of those in the past few months already.

I stopped going to NA meetings because I still wanted to drink alcohol and do recreational drugs occasionally but I am starting to realise I think I am one of those people that just can't do it, I'm just really struggling to accept that and am scared of what living 100% sober will be like because I haven't done that since I was kid.

*I remember when I first met you. You turned plain towns into circus tents, with cotton candy and a kaleidoscope of colors all raining down on me. This, this, I thought, were how things were supposed to be. With you, I felt like only the very best parts of me, the big top music sure did drown out all of the ugly (all of the rest of me). As the shows went on and on, my attendance never wavered- no I came to watch and clap for the elephants and lion tamers every single day.*

*Soon, though, things began to seem amiss- I think I first began to notice when you doubled the price of admission tickets, until my pockets were always empty. So, I had to give up more and more of me, give up every, every,* ***everything*** *just to keep attending.*

*Then, one day I walked by one of the beloved elephants I always screamed and cheered for...and a gust of wind toppled it right over...all along they had been made of cardboard. I had the most terrible epiphany at that moment- you were never honest. You wooed me with your house of mirrors that were just reflective stickers laid onto Styrofoam.*

*God, how my throat choked then... how had I never suspected, even once before?* ***You were never honest.*** *You were an evil force that wanted to run me off of my projected, intended course. I have given more than I knew I could lose just to be hooked on your despondence like I was Hooked On Phonics. And now I've ruined myself to stay and play here, in this fabricated wasteland that I always thought was real.*

*None of this inauthentic circus was ever real, how well I know this now. And oh, how I wish I had just left the day I realized that. But your sad face clowns danced all around me, begging me, fooling me, manipulating the hole in me to stick around and watch the ""show"" that was just a tattered old film reel looping on a projector. The darkness seeped so easily inside of this vulnerable and broken girl, swinging through the sky (but only in her mind) on a wretched tilt a whirl. I never wore a harness.*

*The thing that's proven to be the hardest is detaching myself from the way the colors and the lights seemed to absorb all of my pain...to make peace with the fact that all the promises you made that led my eyes to glisten... you never planned on keeping even a single one of them.*

*Sadly, too, I've spent my life learning from you, so I have made many, many promises of that very same nature since I met you. I thought I'd never have the strength, but I have* ***finally fucking left you.***

 *Now? Now, I am working on keeping my word, keeping my soul; because the circus life was only ever a figment of my imagination that made me less and less whole, every day.*

I’m going to give a bit of my story below for full context, but feel free to skip to the bottom if you’re not interested.

So I got prescribed adderall like many other children were around the time in 2007 due to ADD affecting my ability to perform in school. It did what it was advertised to do and I was able to get through public school with solid grades. 

By the time I got to college, I developed a bad habit of overusing it to accomplish more than a human should be capable of in a week. I recently had been prescribed a 20 mg booster dose in addition to the 30 mg extended release I had been taking daily. After a year of this, I needed 70 mg in a day to feel productive enough to get my daily tasks done. I started using alcohol and other drugs to wind myself down when I eventually needed to sleep or just take the edge off. Eventually the lack of sleep and days at the end of the month where I’d run out of my prescription destabilized my life enough that I dropped out of college.

I’ve been working in various jobs ever since, and have taken some culinary school classes while working in kitchens, although I’ve recently abandoned that line of work after getting fed up with its toxic culture and terrible hours and pay. My habit continued through all of this, and working in a kitchen during a pandemic short staffing crisis was not at all conducive to realizing I needed to quit. Towards the end of every month however, I was still running out of adderall and plunging myself into the depths of lethargy and anhedonia. Despite my best intentions to work on cutting back my usage every month so I wouldn’t run out for almost a week, it always happened. I could always count on returning to that hell, and then finally pick up my script and feel disgustingly euphoric and amped up for the next two days.

Two months ago I ran out of it as always, but decided to say screw it this time and end the cycle by just not picking it up again. I explained to my parents what has been happening with me and they offered to provide support for a while if I needed to stop working to detox. Super thankful that they’ve provided me this opportunity and have been so supportive, it would have been practically impossible for me to hold down a job for the first few weeks.

I’m doing a bit better now than I was a week after I first came off it, but I feel hardly better than I did after the first month mark passed. I still have very little motivation to do much but lie in bed and read my phone most days. I go out to work food delivery some nights, but it’s still a struggle. It’s better than the 16+ hours of sleep I was getting at first, but I’m still sleeping at least 12 hours if I don’t have anything to get up for, and it’s really depressing wasting so much of my day. I dearly miss my hobbies as well. I used to have so much energy to play music, hang out with friends, and engage with the world generally. All of that’s gone and my world is very small now.

Now to the ultimate point of the thread

TL;DR: I’ve been unable to find any hard answers or even anecdotes regarding how long I can expect to wait before my neurochemistry returns to normal. I would have hoped to have been feeling better two months out and I’m starting to wonder if the me without drugs is just an extremely lazy person who might be better off back on them.

Idk. I think not being upfront about my sobriety was dishonest. But cant you participate in a smoke sesh without smoking? My friend and her smoked and drank but I remain abstinent. She hurriedly left after 40 mins.

I quit due to a lung injury stemming from psychotic behavior and the realization that marijuana vapes were irritating my healing lung tissue. The drug use was causing me to go insane and causing me injury from delusions.

I posted yesterday about being on day 4 without any drugs or alcohol but feeling absolutely awful. I really didn’t think I’d get withdrawal as I would occasionally take a day off drinking. So I wasn’t drinking all day everyday and rationalised that as being ok. But in hindsight the occasional day off was probably not enough to of set the amount I was drinking (on average, probably 20 units a day if I didn’t start till the evening, which was normal but more of I’d start earlier - I’d that enough to get withdrawal?).

I’d noticed, but ignored, that when I had a day off (or actually sometimes more recently during the day after drinking but before starting drinking again) I’d feel unwell, like shaky, fuzzy, slightly nauseous, felt like my heart was racing. But it would go away when I started drinking again. I’d also often get night sweats. I’d never considered that this could be due to drinking.

And now (day five!) I still feel physically bad. My head hurts and is fuzzy, I’ve hardly been able to sleep and am exhausted. My hands are shaking (only a little but enough for me to notice), any kind of physical effort makes my heart race, I’ve been having heart palpitations this morning, I’ve got stomach cramps and feel sick. That’s just the physical! Mentally I feel crappy too, very anxious and on edge, but I was expecting that so I guess that’s not worried me so much.

Hi everyone, new to this group, but regularly attend AA meetings (zoom and before that in person). For the past five years, I’ve been struggling to put together more than a year of sobriety at a time, but I’m working the program and when I do I find it works for me. 

My relapses aren’t typically long; The last time I “went out,” I drank for 2 days, then came back and talked to my sponsor. Before that I had seven months with that same sponsor and she’s been amazing and so helpful. I feel strong in my recovery and part of it is definitely due to her. 

So this is why I’m freaking out. We were on the phone tonight, and she sounded...different. Annunciation wasn’t the same, some slurring. At first it sounded like maybe she had in whitening strips or a retainer...we usually talk earlier on the day. Plus, she has over 10 years and no history of relapse . But the longer we spoke the more it sounded like she’d been drinking. Or had taken some other kind of downer.

Obviously part of me is like, am I making this a thing bc of my own history? But I know what I heard. (Not what caused it, just what I heard).

Normally I can talk to her about anything. I don’t know if I can bring this up or if I should say anything... but I’m worried if I don’t say something it will eat me up and ruin our relationship.

I've been in recovery from alcoholism and poly drug addiction for about 2 and a half years now. For almost all of my time being clean, I was at a job where not much was expected of me and I frankly had a lack of work. All of my projects were things that I did when I could gather enough motivation, and nothing I did was on a real deadline.

When I was in active addiction, I was on ADHD meds. I did abuse them and I used them for work and to get high. I was able to be very productive and enjoyed success to the point of publishing in academic journals. That said, my DOC was stimulants. I used a lot of coke and meth.

I've recently switched jobs because I was not given work at my old job, and I've noticed my ability to focus and get motivated on projects assigned to me has been poor. I was diagnosed with ADHD over a decade ago. I talked to my therapist and, to my surprise, she agreed that trying ADHD meds could be good for me as she believes I have a dopamine deficiency. I am open with all of my medical providers about my addiction history. I have tried alternatives such as Wellbutrin and am on an antidepressant that is supposed to help with ADHD but I'm still struggling. I have also scored poorly on executive functioning neurocognitive tests in sobriety and qualified for a clinical trial through a university on an attention supplement. So, I feel I do have a need and my intentions are not to get high.

Making steps towards trying medication has been a really divisive issue among friends and family. Some are supportive and some are deeply angry at me, telling me they don't think I could take them as prescribed and that I'm asking for relapse considering I loved getting high with uppers. I feel I'm at a place in my life where I could use a prescription as medicine and not drugs. Has anyone been through something similar?",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4632516}"

There are so many details and experience to share but I have to be honest I don't really like to spend much time using electronics. I'm currently a mother of twins and I work a full time job and feel like I don't have enough time to fully invest in my recovery. I work out, eat clean 90%. I quit smoking cigarettes and fast intermittently. 
I have a coke problem-  that is pretty much me and my husband or I (secretly) doing coke on the weekends(Friday/Saturday) or occasionally on a Thursday. We wait for the kids to go to bed and we do all of our parenting duties first so there is the sense that it's ok. When I was in my 20's I was only drinking and going out dancing. By 28 I got into hard drugs. Stimulants. Amphetamines and coke. When I got pregnant at 30 I thought I was free. Because I quit and was certain it was for good. Shortly after giving birth I was drinking again and back to cigarettes and then coke here and there. I work hard and take amazing care of my family so I haven't hit rock bottom but I feel immense guilt constantly. Because I feel like I'm on the brink of sobriety just to make a call and boom over. My husband is on the same boat but he smokes pot regularly. He has also made so many positive changes since we had kids but we can't kick the coke habit for good. Like I said I am very busy. I leave 6:30am- come home at 5:30pm. Then cook / clean /... and spend time with the kids until we go to bed at 9pm. And weekends I spend cleaning and preparing for the week and getting all the mommy time in (my husband works weekends) 
My point is I can't find time for meetings and I don't even have the energy to pick up my phone to communicate. I have never shared my problem with anyone. Just my husband. I want so much to be sober. But I am so overworked and I want so much to release.

I could ask my husband for some support but I've ""quit"" so many times I don't think he'd take it too seriously lol.

2021-05-18 20:36:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/nfr3f3/im_scared_of_a_boring_stable_life/,"I'm scared of a boring, stable life","My drug problem started in college when my (super abusive) ex got me hooked on weed and adderall. I also love nitrous and psychedelics. It escalated, and by the end after some traumatic events I was taking a gross amount of adderall to finish my classes because I was so depressed. Then I had a psychotic break from the stress and drugs that summer in 2018. I did not get along with my psychiatrist and got a long-term shot of a really strong antipsychotic called Haldol.

If you've never been on a high antipsychotic dose, you're lucky. It makes it impossible to think or be comfortable in your body. It turns you into a zombie. It is an absolute nightmare.

The Haldol broke my brain, and I was in a huge depression for about a year using just weed. I then started doing shrooms, LSD and adderall again and was so happy since I felt like they brought my intelligence back. Then I could not stop.

When the pandemic came, I had nothing to do and extra cash from the stimulus checks. I was also processing a lot of trauma and so sick of being sad. So my drug use escalated. I added benzos to the mix and had to go through withdrawal last October.

I got a restaurant job around the same time of my psychotic break, and long story but I pissed off the boss and ended up being stalked and eventually raped in February. I had a lot of spare cash for the first time in my life really, and I started doing absurd amounts of nitrous (along with weed) after the rape just to numb myself. Eventually this turned into psychosis again, though it was not nearly as intense as in 2018.

I started using drugs, specifically weed, to treat depression, but at this point it's just prolonging it. I have tripped psychedelics so much in the past few years that I'm not getting anything out of it. I cannot use adderall (or pressed meth) anymore since it makes me a crazy asshole, and I started becoming afraid to work without it. I've spent the past few years processing trauma, and there's not much more to process at this point. I need to make new memories.

So the idea is that I get healthy and sober and become engaged in my life again. Hopefully I'll never be manic or psychotic again either. But here's the problem—I like the highs and lows of mental illness and drug use. I have a pattern of getting sucked in abusive relationships. There's something about being in intense emotional or physical pain that I like better than feeling just ""fine."" Like it makes me feel alive. And I love getting high.

I've been neglecting my goals to do drugs, but instead of being excited to move forward in life, I'm just scared. What if I don't like being stable? Will I spend all my time thinking about the drugs I could be doing? I have a complicated family and wasn't happy before college, and since then my life has been a blur of drugs and abuse. I know I need to quit before I waste my life (weed is the one I use daily... I relapsed twice already so it's Day 1 again), but it's hard to believe sobriety could actually be worth it.",8,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.61875385}"

One important thing to note is that I didn't actually get clean on my own, my friend who was my source was worried about me and stopped providing them to me. So, it really feels like I didn't actually develop any willpower to stop using on my own, that it was more because I had no other option. 

These withdrawals are really scaring me because it really feels like if I had the option to use again then I wouldn't hesitate to and I'd ruin all my progress which is something I can't really do to my friend, family or boyfriend.

I am not prepared to do this, at least not with the sponsor that I had, even though they were a decent person in many respects, I didn't believe that I could be completely honest with them or do what they asked of me in later steps to make amends for my behaviour.

The running mascara

The i don’t remembers

I miss the carefree, but I don’t miss the spiral

I’m scared of who I am when I’m not sober.

When I stopped, I didn’t know if it was forever. When I learned that it cripples my body and how it handles anxiety - I knew I was done drinking. But, when life comes at me hard, I still want to stop what I am feeling. I want off the roller coaster of life. And, here I am, on the roller coaster, and I am so tired. So I am resting this weekend. I am disconnecting from my friends at the bar because those relationships keep me in contact with my ex. And seeing him is like getting a hit of dopamine. Even my early recovery was contingent on his love. I was working to become someone he could love again. The last four months have been me realizing I am wonderful even if he doesn’t love me. And he doesn’t. So I am having to extricate myself from that connection and look to myself for my worth and value. So here’s to my first weekend no contact. I will survive and I am coming out the other end shining. 

I hit 9 months sober this week. It is amazing to have 9 months when, in August, I didn’t know if I could string together 30 days. This week, I learned not only is teaching easier when I am sober, it is now one of my super powers. I was able to highlight avoidance behaviors in a student and voice my sincere concerns that this behavior is very dangerous for her. My concerns prompted the father to ask if he was more vulnerable and shared with her how he overcomes hard feelings with her, would that help his daughter. This conversation was not just about problematic school behaviors. It got to the root and helped the parents see more into the situation other than she starts drama at school. I never would have had that insight had I not gotten sober and got rid of my crutch that I used to stop feeling my feelings. I didn’t know avoiding feelings was part of my crutch with alcohol. I used it most often to stop the stress from teaching or from being a single mom. 

And, man, have my feelings been front and center! And I find that I am resting more. The stress work used to cause me is gone. My need to be validated by having someone in my life is not so overwhelming. I find I want to connect with someone and share my life, but I am not altering myself to have that need met. My need to be fully myself is overriding my need to be with someone. Being authentically present drives me in how I connect with others and anything less than being my authentic self is not good enough anymore.

 I am 22 and I am struggling. I have been off and on and addicted to a lot since I was 16, and it all started with cocaine and it is the one thing I have not been able to kick. From alcohol to oxycodone, hydrocodone, xanax, mdma, ketamine, nitrous, etc I loved it all almost instantaneous. I use to think that shit was cool when I was growing up and I felt invincible doing it all, and I always had the ""I can control it"" or ""I'll never be like that guy"" attitude. I do believe I have came a long way from where I was at ages 18-21 and I attribute a lot of that to my wonderful girlfriend who is a recovered addict and someone who went through a lot of terrible shit at a young age. I'm high at 3AM trying to put my feelings into words currently because when I am high is when these feelings come out the most. I am just at a complete standstill with my journey to erase this dreadful drug from my life. I am finally looking into going to some meetings and removing the chance to have the opportunity to be around the drug even if that means removing certain people who will not respect that (sadly a few of my real friends are not ready to do this with me).

This thread is meant to start a conversation on the principle of kratom's potential role in quitting opioids. I do not personally endorse or advise any particular action other than 'if in doubt talk to a real doctor instead of strange people on the internet'.

I left this as a comment in another thread but I would like to hear some more opinions.

I do not typically recommend kratom to anyone for any reason, in fact have largely begun steering people away from it entirely. Knowing the profoundly negative impact it had on not only my own mental health over my long term long-term use, but also on the mental health of some I know personally who had become habituated to it. In addition to how difficult it was to break my own addiction to just kratom on its own. Under typical circumstances, for otherwise well adjusted people, I cannot in good conscience endorse anyone begin using kratom having first hand knowledge of what it can lead to.

However, this is the one particular area in which it can be of great utility, and for me or anyone else to suggest it is worth no consideration categorically would not be giving the full picture.

Kratom can work for quitting harder opioids, and from what I read where it does it works quite well (I do not have personal experience with this, based on a wide array of anecdotes). However the essential part is to stop the kratom as soon as the worst of the primary withdrawal is over. Addicts being addicts, this is the problem.

Staying on it any longer than absolutely necessary to accomplish the original purpose, or consuming any more than the smallest effective dose, only risks forming a new addiction. Typically a much milder one to break, yes, but quitting kratom itself can be an ordeal. This much I do know from experience.

So really it comes down to a personal evaluation. Before considering it, one must honestly ask themselves if they have the self-control to use it appropriately for the task. If there is even a shadow of a doubt, do not.

There is a reason absolute abstinence from any mind altering substance outside of a closely monitored medical setting is preached so strongly in recovery circles, and that is because for many (perhaps even the vast majority), it is the only reliable way to go. There is no shame in pursuing other medically assisted detox options when and where they are available. If for whatever reason you must do it on your own, and cold turkey isn't working, kratom can be a viable option.

It would be ideal if it were investigated further scientifically and eventually be offered as a prescribed, supervised, and regulated medical treatment. But for now, for a variety of reasons, it isn't. Anyone who chooses to go this route is almost entirely on their own.

This ended up being much longer than I anticipated, and I hope it made any sense. The question of using kratom for such a legitimate use case as quitting harder opioids is one I have thought about extensively. One must consider if it is truly the lesser of two evils. There is much nuance in this, many may disagree with me and say it is not worth the potential for further harm, and while that may be very true for some, for others it can and frequently is the magic bullet that gets them off opioids. It is a function of potential risk vs the potential for great benefit, as well as an exercise in truly honest self-reflection for anyone to determine for themselves if it is a viable way to go.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49101913}"

On Friday I lost my best friend to suicide. I'm not a gambler, but he was. He was only 24 but had been gambling on and off for around 7 years. He was the best guy I knew. He struggled with it for years, going to GA meetings, yielding control of his finances, seeing therapists. His rational, in the end, was that his friends and family would be better off without him being a burden on them. He believed there was no light at the end of the tunnel, that he would just spiral down and down bringing everyone with him.

Please listen when I say that he is wrong. He is so wrong. We are all completely shattered, and no amount of money could bring him back. I would slave away the rest of my life paying his debts just to have him back here for another second. You can do this, your family loves you, your friends love you. Please, no matter what, hang in there, you can get through this. Reach out, there are support services out there, there are people who dedicate their lives to help people like you.

Today I took an 11 mile solo hike. A bunch of stories and metaphors from it but I will stick this one.   It’s a bit long but it means something to me. 

About half way in there is a side trail - I didn’t research it but “why not.”  It eads down a hill via wooden steps. 821 wooden steps. I did the math (like 30-40 stories). Sure why not. It’s only steps. 

Going down the steps is “easy” but I’m getting a bit anxious. I’m not fit but I can hike.  Steps are my Achilles heel. Going down down down. So easy. Half way through I come across a young father walking up (about half way down) carrying his toddler. He asks if I knew if the trail just ended at the bottom (I thought it did) and he tells me he saw some reviews about a trail down there that led to a waterfall but he couldn’t find it. It gave me inspiration. If he can carry a child I sure can make this happen. 

Well, I get to the bottom and it’s a little underwhelming but I have a great idea - I am going to find that waterfall. I follow an old trail. And a bit more and it leads to another old trail that had clearly been closed off. Steep down as all get out and inhospitable. Yep, I’m going to do it. I hear water. I know there is the river down there but surely there is a waterfall. Somehow make it down only to encounter the railroad tracks. I see the river down an even steeper embankment. 

I stop and pause. What am I doing? Nobody knows I am down here. Railroads don’t like people crossing there tracks and I am searching for something that doesn’t exist. 

My recovery finally hits me. I just went down down down chasing a dream.  The metaphor of rock bottom was very clear. 

Now I pause. Recoup with food and water because now I know have to do all of that in reverse. Closed steep trail, 821 wooden steps rising 400 feet, and then still finish my original hike. 

I begin. One step at a time. It’s all hard. Took me a lot longer to get back up. Paused probably 100 times and made just small little goals that I could achieve. And I made it. Let out a yell because I was proud of myself (despite my off trail foolishness). 

Side note - I’m sitting at the top of said steps regaining energy and reflecting and a women just walks by chatting on her phone. Whatever. I’m walking back on the trail - maybe a mile away - and she passes me. She made it down and up and was passing me!  Normies!

Spent 6 months in there and found it to be really helpful, thought I was always going to be an addict, I was heavily addicted to meth and GHB but managed to get clean (woo)

I felt like I was slowly becoming the person I used to be prior to using drugs. I started rebuilding relationships with family and friends, working on my mental health issues that contributed to why I used drugs (low self esteem, anxiety, depression), had goals and was excited to start doing something with my life the first time in years.

My life prior to going to rehab was fucked, I pushed all the people in my life who actually cared about me away. I was doing horrible things to get money to feed my habit and just completely lost touch with who I was as a person before I touched these shit drugs. 

Anyway, I left rehab feeling so much better and felt confident theres no way i'm ever going back to that shit life. A few weeks pass and things are good, but for some reason i have this feeling of… being underwhelmed with sobriety? 

Being sober is good, life is so much easier and I’m generally happy .

But after not being part of ‘normal society’ for a while, I’m just having a hard time adjusting to life, it’s boring and I just don’t find much joy in normal people things?

One of the reasons I got into drugs was because I’m never content with life and always looking for something more and exciting. This is probably a pretty common feeling for addicts in recovery, I’ve never understood how most people can just be content with their average lives, whereas I feel like I will never be content/fully happy with my life..

I realize this is on me and that only I can do it. An addict always finds a way to get his/her fix if they want it bad enough.

Please give me tips on how to combat that tug-of-war I have with my brain to use a couple days into withdrawal. Please. I truly do want to break free of my addiction so badly. I’m at the lowest point of my life right and I spend over have the day in bed, crying, sober or not. I’m that miserable with my life. I’m so afraid.

My birthday is coming up (1st June) and I don’t know what to do. Usually I’d do drugs, and I have no idea what else to do instead of doing drugs. I’d usually have a birthday wake and bake and then a party in the evening. I’m really nervous for my birthday as I already know I’m going to want to use all day, and my brother will be getting drunk, and everyone I know will want to have a party and drink and do drugs. 

I really want to skip it this year but my partner and friends won’t let me, we have a thing of celebrating everyone’s birthdays so they wouldn’t let me skip it. Does anyone have any ideas on what we could do? I’m at a complete loss and it’s really stressing me out and making me crave. I know there’s loads of fun sober stuff to do but my mind instantly goes to relapse.

I'm compiling a list of things that I need to read and so far I've found things like the National Harm Reduction Coalition and SMART Recovery, but I'm finding it difficult to find other places to research. While googling I keep running into walls advocating mostly twelve-step programs. I want to learn more about what options are out there so I can educate myself in preparedness for the substance abuse class I will soon be taking in college. I know the twelve-step groups, while popular, don't work for everyone and there has to be another option, right? I'm not a fan of the traditional twelve-step programs like AA, NA, EDA, CoDA, EA, SLAA, etc. for personal (traumatic) reasons. I suspect there will be a paper based on the twelve-step programs and I'd love to be further educated so I can present a well-prepared argumentative paper advocating for other forms of recovery. If there's a better place for me to post this, please let me know.

Thank y'all for your time.

For those who don't know what that is- I will share with my sponser all of my resentments, fears, secrets, my part in those I resent and just let it all out and let it go). This is supposed to be a very liberating process as resentments are the biggest reason one relapses as the Big Book says. 

There was a girl here who just got out a week ago, she had been here for 2+ months and was working so hard and really really seemed ready, like she had it- we were so proud.
It took less than 5 days and she was back in treatment lying in the bed next to me almost overdosed. 
It shook us all to our core, we all want to assume that it's rainbows and butterflies after we have worked the steps and done a lot of emotional sobriety and gotten down to the nitty gritty of our problems and root causes. We feel sure we'll stay sober. I know that the real world is still there when we return back to it, and things are still around us that can be triggering... but it made me very scared to see a beautiful woman relapse so easily.

It was the best times of my life. I was working the steps for the first time and I had hope. Somewhere along the way I started struggling and wasn't able to ask for help. I felt a lot of pride, and I didn't want people to think I wasn't doing well. I was looked up to. We've all heard this story, right? People always talked about how we look forward to getting a year clean then we hit it and nothing magical happens. It's just another day, and we end up relapsing. My story is not unique.  


I've been using for a year straight now. I moved away from all my friends in recovery, so I could use in secret and try to steer away from any shame. I hate myself. I still tell my friends I'll have two years sober in a week. This shame is probably what's keeping me using. I'm scared they'll tell me to come back to treatment, but I don't think that's the answer. I have been in and out of long term treatment since I was 22. I love it in treatment, someone else makes my decisions for me and I'm safe there. Going back there seems like steps backwards for me, that I'm constantly looking for others to take responsibility for me.

So, I'm stuck. Every day I pray that I will stop or slow down, and I end up just using harder or saying tomorrow will be the day that I will stop. I listen to speaker tapes, but hell I have all the knowledge in the world about recovery, but it avails us nothing. I take no action steps. I never completed step 9. I have all this guilt and shame inside of me. I know everything I do wrong and I can't stand myself for it. Maybe that's what went wrong at one year sober. The shame.

I just walked into my first NA meeting and did a U-turn when I heard the group chant *something something* “higher power” *something something* at the beginning just as in AA. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s great that the inclusion of a higher power works for so many people. It saved my mom and she was non religious before turning her life around with AA.

It’s just not for me.

I stumbled through the next few minutes and was making bumbles left and right. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t answer questions kids or teachers were asking.

“I’m sorry. I just found out my friend died.” My colleague immediately went to go get his lap top and came in to releive me. I started the movie and went into my classroom.

Over the next hour, I spoke with her husband and learned that her heart stopped and they couldn’t get it started again. How many times had I seen that on TV? I reached out to our mutual friends and to the sobriety groups we shared together. How do we let people know? Yes, Annie died. Yes, she was only 40. No, they don’t know why. Yes, she had gotten Covid and the vaccine. None of this makes sense. Don’t post it to the Teacher Group or to the Main Group till after school. I got a hold of Mary before she saw online. I decided to leave for the rest of the afternoon which at that point amounted to an hour and a half.

I sat down to eat lunch at my favorite bar. They’re my friends. It was my place to go to not be alone. I sat and ate and watched a baseball game. I went back to go get my son and went home.

I got home and went to therapy and watched Big Bang. She explained it would make sense I didn’t want to eat. My nervous system was in override. I was handling texts and messages as the news came out. Yes. It’s true. Annie died. Yes, she was the one with the blue hair. Yes she was the science teacher with the Periodic Table in the background. Yes, she was gone. No, we don’t know why.

Our teacher group held a meeting and her husband joined us. He shared about Amy and his past week. I held it together till the end when the talk became about all she was trying to do was get more healthy so they could have a baby. Then, I cried. She had been a mom to Nicholas and was showing him that love was not toxic or manipulated. He was beginning to trust that she did love him. She and her husband only had 5 years together, and it wasn’t fair. I began to sob.

I made it to the next group meeting that was holding space for Annie. And I sobbed as others talked about her. I shared that I missed my friend. In recovery, I learned that it doesn’t matter it was only on a zoom screen. I loved her and I missed her. To find another teacher who truly had a heart for kids and was passionate about every single one of them was rare. To find someone who was also trying to live their life without alcohol and a teacher with a heart for kids, once in a lifetime, and she was gone. And I sobbed. Gut wrenching sobs. I was angry. Why the fuck did this happen? She was doinng it right. She was never hurtful to anyone and she was one better. She made people shine! And she was gone.

On the way home from school, I got an update about my student and her brain damage is significant. I sobbed. How was I supposed to do this sober?

After the meetings, I got into bed and I watched Big Bang Theory. I lost myself in the show and the good feelings it brings me, but they were hollow that night. I laid down to sleep around midnight. I gave up at two. I tried to eat my comfort food because I hadn’t eaten since breakfast the day before.

The announcement about her death came out and it was wrong. I went back into pleading mode to get the corrections made. I went to meetings and I sobbed. I texted my therapist to see if he had any time. I was drowning. I couldn’t eat and drink. Everything felt wrong. My son came in and left for his dad’s. I asked if he was okay and he said, “I’m afraid you’re going to drink.” I responded, “So, am I. But, I’m staying home so I don’t.”

As the afternoon went on, I felt worse and worse. I could not stop crying. My stomach was tightening up. My breathing became more shallow. So many sober friends were reaching out. My small group of sober friends who also struggle with disordered eating encouraged me to go in and be seen. It was amazing how quickly I was physically going down hill. I reached out to my parents because I felt so lost. And, their response was empty and I felt more alone. It felt like I was being sucked down in this hole. I called my psychiatrist. Talked to the Crisis line. They encouraged me to go in so we could stop whatver was happening and get me to a point where I was physically okay.

So, how do I get to urgent care? Uber. How do I get home? Can’t call my boyfriend. We’re not together anymore. Can’t call my teacher friends. They don’t have any idea about my life like this. I reached out to a friend from Life Ring who lives in Colorado and she said she would drive 45 min – 1 hour to come take me home on a Friday at rush how. After fluids and some meds at urgent care, I came home. I ate. I messaged friends, and then I slept. Throughout all of this. I cried. I messaged my son that I was sober and to let him know I was okay.

The next day was filled with more meetings and more tears. I was drinking fluids but I couldn’t eat. I slept a little, I guess, in the afternoon. Went to another meeting and sobbed. I just could not believe she was gone. Everyone else had had a week and a half to process. I was punched in the gut and could not breathe. My friend, Mary, and I watched the memorial. It was hard because these people did not know her as sober. They were missing so much, but I had to honor her choice not to bring them into that part of her life. At the end of watching it together, Mary and I shared what we would’ve said about our friend Annie, “She was a sober badass who loved her family and her students fiercely and this world was empty without her.”

And, then I found some peace. I ate. And then I slept. The pain was not gushing out in tears. I made some peace with her being gone and learned that I held a love for her deeper than I had realized. I wish I had realized it more when she was alive.

I listened to a response when I shared on Sunday, and it made all the sense in the world. Every place that was still soft in my heart, my student, my breakup, my estranged family, and Annie’s death all got touched by the grief and all that pain rolled together. I knew my only way was through it, and drinking would only postpone it. So I didn’t drink. I cried more than I ever have.

Today, I cried in a meeting without warning. That happens now that I am sober. It happened last week too. April sucked. May better be better. Annie would’ve loved the FB avatars for May the Fourth be with you. We all smiled when we thought of her today.",6,"{'covid': 1, 'vaccine': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7466171}"

2021-05-03 16:47:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/n46wab/sober_grief/,Sober Grief,"April has been an incredibly hard month for me which is why I have not posted till now. I have stayed sober through a lot of reflecting on what I have learned about alcohol and how my body responds to alcohol. The timeline for April:

April 2nd - I broke up with my boyfriend after getting sober. We had been together for almost 2 years.

April 5th - I shared my recovery story.

April 8th - I returned to work.

April 13th - I found out one of my students had incurred a devastating traumatic brain injury.

April 22nd - I found out my dear friend had died on April 12th. Her heart stopped beating unexpectedly and they could not restart it.

After over functioning and coordinating disseminating information to our recovery group and shared friends, I went full bore into grief. This was the first time I had ever experienced grief without alcohol to numb. Finding out about my student, Emma, slowed me down the week before. I had a couple of rough nights, but I was able to function. Finding out about Amy's death stopped me in my tracks. After I began to cry at a recovery meeting remembering her, I did not stop till Saturday night. I did not sleep at all Thursday night. I didn't eat or keep up on my fluids. My nervous system was overloaded. I went to urgent care to stop my body shutting down to get fluids because I was so severely dehydrated. My son shared as he left for his dad's, ""I'm afraid you're going to drink."" And truthfully, so was I.

I went to meetings non stop and was glued to Amy's memorial page. Any time I tried to talk, I was crying. I missed her so much. She and I were both sober, both teachers, and both moms to 12 year old boys. We shared so much in common that when I reached out to her, very little preamble or context was needed for her to fully understand what I was trying to say and her support was always spot on.

In November, I started an online support group for teachers doing this sober. She jumped right into help manage the group and run meetings while I was out for surgery. It is so hard to find other teachers who ""get it"", who have a heart for kids and loves teaching. Amy was all of that for me and the hole in my heart is huge. I know it worse for her family.

When I grieved her death, my other losses snuck up on me, too. I had no idea how I was going to do this sober. It was truly the deepest darkest pain I have yet to know because I did not escape with alcohol. I stopped caring for myself and had to get medical help. My drinking did not come back, but my eating disorder came back in raring to go. The doctor was truly compassionate and reminded me this was a bandaid to stop the trajectory of my decline.

After the meeting on Saturday night, my friend and I watched her memorial from the day before. I were said they did not know the sober side of Amy, but respected her wishes that her journey was private at this point. I was able to speak aloud what I would have shared. I would not be able to recall for you what I said, but I know I felt peace after and was able to sleep.

The next day I met four sober moms in person. All of us were at different stages of your sobriety and it was such a helpful conversation. I had the most delicious maple cream cheese frosting on a croissant and at the whole thing. Amy, being a foodie, would have approved. The next day, I started doing laundry, cleaning my house and made an energy connection with Amy through an Angel Card reading. It was so powerful and peaceful. It brought me closure.

And, I made it to 256 days sober through one of the darkest parts of my recovery path. The connections you make online to others getting sober are no less real because they are online only. The vulnerability we share connects us in ways some of our friends and family, in real life, have not had the chance to. Being sober has been hard, but what stopped me from drinking is that I could not handle the anxiety that would be there the next morning along with the overwhelming grief. I let myself feel all the pain. I didn't run. I didn't try to escape it. I went through every hard part. I reached out to every resource. I had built such a community many that many people were checking on me. I contacted my therapist to see if he even had 30 minutes for me. I went to urgent care when I was getting behind the 8 ball with dehydration. I used ALL my tools. I only reached out to two people who were not there for me, but as the saying goes, ""You can't shop for eggs in a hardware store."" The only to stay sober is to feel. Feel all of it. It is hard as fuck, but I did come out the other side.

A little about me I used to be incredibly suicidal due to abuse I don't  feel like going  into but it robbed me of my youth and I used 0p8s as a coping mechanism  to  stop with flashbacks and thinking  of what he and his friends  did to me. Which then led me to think any time  I'd have a major problem it's time to end it. I lost my apartment  after losing  a very lucrative  job and my first reaction  to the problem  was that's it you're hanging yourself  luckily the rope untangled due to my weight. It wasn't supported correctly and I wound up falling a couple feet on my back.  I am 5'11 and around  160 so I ain't fat but I am also not petite either.

To cope with suiciidal thoughts I'd Smoke a little black nod out feel euphoric and eat some ice cream. Now the black ain't around  as much and I got a stronger batch of clear burn  to what I am used to. I smoked the same amount fell off the toilet hit my head got stitches and almost  died thank christ  my roommate  found me and rushed up when he heard me fall and didn't answer the door. (He assumed  I tried killing  myself again)

I am very disappointed  at my ex (sort of) for telling  me pills help with the terrors and flashbacks back in high school.  She had similar experiences  and I can't blame her for her shit advice but I was the one who put that hydro in me at 15. It helped but it also led me down a left hand path where anything  that would make me nod out and feel good  I'd be down for. It was like putting a veil on my issues they were there but like a sheet it was a thin piece  of  cloth over a bed of problems that I'd lay upon.

I had a fucking breathing  tube up the nose the whole nine yards. What scared me the most was  I saw the light and heard voices from past friends who I lost tell me I am fucking  idiot and a cunt it was probably  my subconscious but still a jarring thing to hear your  best friend who was lost in October  under similar  circumstances  tell you it isn't your time and you'll make this if you quit.

Which brings me to my next question  how is suboxone compared to methadone? 

I wanted to quit cold turkey but the doctor  said the withdrawals are fucking  horrible (well he said it in better words that I can't recall in this haze but something  about seizures if I recall correctly and I need to be tapered off) 

Also how is the first couple  months  in recovery  I'd imagine  its going to be  hard but what should  I  look forward  to experiencing  whilst quitting.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8484978}"
