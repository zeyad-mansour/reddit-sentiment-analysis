I couldn’t make out the words, but I didn’t need to. The sound was unnerving enough without knowing what was being said. As I opened my eyes and adjusted to my surroundings, I was reminded once again where I was: jail. Suddenly, the sights, sounds, and yes, smells, came flooding back in to my head. With them came the cold reality of where I was, who I had become, and where my life had ended up.

If being regularly jolted awake by the tormented screams of inmates in neighboring cells wasn’t bad enough, there was the fact that I was sharing a cell designed for a single inmate with three other people. We were crowded four deep in a tiny cell, and there was no escaping the smell. To call it unpleasant would be putting it lightly. It was overpowering.

As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at the bottom of the bunk above me. On it was a hurricane of words… angry, unstable words, scratched into the metal bed frame by those who had been there before me. The words sounded a lot like the things that many of the people around me uttered every day. This was an insane place, and for the time being, it was home.

In that moment, my mind jumped back once again to the decisions that had brought me here, and the people who had been hurt because of my choices. I said to myself, “You had so many loving people in your life, but this time you’ve lost them. You had every good thing that anyone could ask for, and you threw it all away because of your actions.” I thought about the person I had become and the downward spiral I had traveled for so long. I thought to myself, “How did I get here?”

I got started down the road to substance use in middle school for a few reasons. I was a scared, awkward kid who desperately wanted to be liked, but didn’t quite fit the mold that everyone else was in. I was definitely different, and not always in a way that was seen as good. I wasn’t even remotely comfortable in my own skin. So I thought I’d win my peers’ approval and acceptance by drinking. In addition to that, I was curious to see what it was like. Finally, there were some people I looked up to who had substance use issues of their own, and they seemed completely happy and successful. So, while I had been told about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, what I had seen conveyed a very different message.

The first time I drank, one of the worst things that could have possibly happened did happen: nothing. I don’t mean that the alcohol didn’t affect me. I mean that there weren’t any immediate consequences, at least that I could notice. After having been told what drugs and alcohol would do to me, I was anticipating some kind of instant lightning bolt of consequence. When nothing seemed to go wrong, I thought, “There’s no price to pay for this. I just did it and I’m fine. The world didn’t end. They lied to me about this.” I’ve since learned something very important about consequences. There is a consequence for every negative or unhealthy decision we make, but they don’t always happen immediately and we don’t always notice them right away. Sometimes they don’t become apparent until much later, and sometimes they chase you down the road years later.

I noticed that when I drank, everything seemed to get better. My pain seemed to go away. I was dealing with bullying and feeling very out of place in junior high, and when I drank, I quit feeling the sadness from that. It seemed to allow me to finally be comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t realize that the feeling was a lie. When I got into high school, alcohol was a lot easier to get, and I started using it as a way to deal with my problems. My alcohol use became much more frequent and I started drinking larger quantities. I didn’t realize how much worse I was making things for myself. None of it seemed like a big deal at the time. Alcohol then gave way to marijuana, nitrous oxide (Whip-Its), and some initial experimentation with prescription drugs.

By the time I was a freshman in college, I was using marijuana daily and drinking frequently. Later in college I got caught in the web of opiate painkillers after a friend with a prescription gave me some oxycodone. After I started on painkillers, the floodgates opened. The feeling from opiates was a step beyond alcohol in my quest to escape my pain, disintegrating relationship, and my growing dislike for myself. Somehow I miraculously made it through college with a decent GPA and managed to get my degree. I’m still not completely sure how I managed that.

Shortly after college, I got into ecstasy and cocaine. I developed a huge cocaine habit that eventually led me to getting into meth, once the cocaine ceased being effective. Right around the same time, my painkiller addiction led to heroin after it became impossible to get legitimate prescriptions and expensive to buy illicit opiate pharmaceuticals. Alcohol was there all along, in ridiculously excessive quantities. Eventually, I became willing to use just about any substance that happened to cross my path. When someone asked what my drug of choice was, I laughingly quoted the Alice in Chains song “Junkhead.” “What’s my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?”

My life was a mess. I lost jobs due to absenteeism, quit other jobs due to an inability to focus, and eventually stopped trying to get jobs. I drained a $10,000 bank account on my addiction. I had nothing to show for it but increasing health problems. There was alcohol poisoning. There were overdoses. There was one particular overdose involving a combination of cocaine, meth, alcohol, and fentanyl (a powerful synthetic opioid) that was absolutely hellish and insane. To this day, it surprises me that I made it through that one. My behavior was erratic and I became angry and unpredictable. At one point, coke and meth made me a 130lb skeleton. At a later point, alcohol made me a 215lb slug.

This went on for years. I lost my 20’s and the better part of my 30’s. I wanted to stop but was so caught up in it all. I was making all kinds of bad decisions. I’m responsible for my own choices, but addiction and the damaged thinking that comes with it makes it a whole lot easier to make bad choices. Eventually I was no longer using to feel good, but to not feel horrible. I was drinking and using purely out of addiction and the need to avoid withdrawal. Guilt and shame kept me running back to drugs and alcohol, which led to behavior that caused me guilt and shame. It was an endless cycle.

I ended up jobless for a long time, and thousands of dollars in debt. My thinking and brain chemistry were so overwhelmed by the substances to which I was a slave. I came to a point where I hated myself and said, “I’m never coming back from this. I’ve done too much damage. I’m going to ride this train until it crashes.” The last night I drank and used, I went on a rampage. I hurt people who didn’t deserve it, smashed up my own house, and eventually attempted to end my own life. I was arrested and charged with multiple felonies. If I had been convicted of everything I was charged with, I was looking at the possibility of a doing few years in the Arizona Department of Corrections.

That’s what led to me serving time in Durango Jail, part of Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s notorious Maricopa County Jail system. While in jail, I went through hellish withdrawals. The extent of the jail’s acknowledgement of my withdrawal consisted of giving me a bottom bunk, so I would be less likely to get a concussion if my withdrawals led to a seizure that ended up with me falling out of bed. I suffered horrible insomnia and only managed to occasionally sleep for about 15 minutes at a time. It was less like sleeping and more like passing out. I genuinely felt like I was going insane. I went through a combination of the worst physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pain I’ve ever felt. I genuinely believed that I had lost everyone and everything I loved and cared about. I found myself at a nearly unbearable low point.

I became willing to do anything to repair the damage I had done, but wasn’t sure that such repair would even be possible. While in the midst of this, I somehow found a tiny bit of sanity, which allowed me to make myself a promise to make my faith, my family, and my sobriety my priorities. A fellow inmate named Troy gave me a Bible, which I started reading. It was a welcome escape and was the only thing that gave me any kind of hope in those moments. I latched on to that Higher Power and never let go.

I eventually bailed out while my case was pending, and I moved into a place called the Phoenix Dream Center. It’s a live-in facility where people who have had substance use issues, people who have been in jail and prison, people who have been homeless, former gang members, and victims of human trafficking can move in and get their lives back together. A lot of good growth and healing started for me there, but it wasn’t easy.

In a lot of ways, the Dream Center is harder than jail. Our days started at 4 a.m. and ended at 11 p.m. Every moment was scheduled for us and included intense morning workouts (run by a former pro rugby star), classes, janitorial work, maintenance work, labor, homeless outreach, church, etc. We were run ragged, but the discipline, structure, and purpose were what I (and the others there) needed as part of a successful recovery.

While in the Dream Center, I poured myself back into my faith, which remains a key component of my recovery today. I started communicating again, instead of trying to run from my problems. I made exercise and nutrition a big part of my life. I started creating art and writing again. I started to laugh again. I gained back my self-respect and others’ trust. As a result of the changes that began there, I was able to restore my marriage; something I hoped would happen but didn’t know was possible.

In court, the prosecutor was seeking 90 days of jail time for me, and the Probation Presentence Writer wanted me to do six months. I didn’t want either to happen, as they could delay the good work that had begun in my marriage, and in my growth as a person. I accepted a plea deal. Based on what I said and others said at my sentencing, the judge said that he didn’t see any benefit to me serving additional time. To this day, I am grateful he listened to me and to the others who spoke. I was sentenced to two years supervised probation. I was assigned 46 weeks of one type of counseling and 15 weeks of another. I was given a permanent (“designated”) felony and lost my rights as an American citizen. I paid thousands of dollars in court fines and fees. I was given a 10 p.m. curfew. I was randomly drug tested.

Under really interesting circumstances, I ran into a guy who overheard part of my story and told me I should apply to be a substance use Peer Educator at a local prevention nonprofit called notMYkid. I did. In January of 2013, I started there as a part-time youth Peer Educator and worked as hard as I could. I spoke in schools across Arizona, sharing the experience and knowledge I learned during my journey with students in 6th through 12th grade. I decided to be as open and honest as I could about my past in order to help prevent others from taking the same path. I did everything I was asked to do and took on additional duties. I was relentless and determined in my efforts. Within the first three months, they made me full time. Four months later, I was given a staff position, and became the organization’s first Communications Coordinator.

I was then promoted to Manager of Parent and Faculty Education for the organization and eventually became a Prevention Specialist. I research several behavioral health topics and create presentations for parents, school faculty members, after school program mentors, and camp counselors. I have also recruited, hired, trained, and managed several Parent and Faculty Educators, who are primarily behavioral health professionals and current or former law enforcement officers. I do student/youth presentations on substance use, bullying, and a combination topic of depression, self-injury, and suicide. I do parent and faculty presentations on substance use, bullying, depression/self-injury/suicide, prescription drug misuse, and Internet safety. I also do TV, radio, web, and print interviews as the organization’s representative. I’ve done approximately 80 interviews in the last few years, including live TV appearances in New York, Boston, Dallas, Denver, and Kansas City. Those interviews have included the “Today” show, “Good Day New York,” “Kansas City Live,” NECN Boston, and WFAA Dallas.

I currently travel around Arizona doing speaking engagements, sharing my personal story intertwined with teachable keys to behavioral health. I’ve had the opportunity to share my story with students and government officials in Boston, students and parents in California, and parents in Kansas City. I’ve spoken to groups as small as five people and as large as 1,000. I’ve done as many as seven one-hour presentations back-to-back. I’ve had the chance to address the Pinal County Drug Court, sharing my story and thoughts on the way government and the courts view addiction. I’ve presented at Grand Canyon University, Arizona State University, Paradise Valley Community College, and a number of corporations, Including American Express, Cox, Intel, and Insight. As of November 2021, I’ve done over 600 presentations to an audience of over 150,000 people at more than 200 different venues. Approximately half of my presentations have been given to youth, and the other half to adults.

I also had the opportunity to do interviews for a historic documentary called “Hooked: Tracking Heroin’s Hold on Arizona,” which was simulcast on every TV station (and most radio stations) in Arizona on January 13th, 2015. Additionally, I was appointed to the Recovery and Response Subcommittee responsible for developing, staffing, and overseeing the crisis line phone bank taking calls during and after the airing of the documentary. I also served on the Recovery and Response Subcommittee tasked with overseeing the crisis line response for the sequel documentary called “Hooked Rx,” which aired in early 2017.

In October of 2015, I had the chance to become an ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) trainer. As a registered trainer, I now have the honor of facilitating two-day suicide intervention workshops, and teaching genuinely lifesaving intervention skills to people around the state of Arizona. It has allowed me to combine my personal experience with the topic, and my passion for helping others, with the well-designed material that has become the industry standard (crisis lines, military, fire departments, police departments) for suicide intervention. I have since used my experience and training to help multiple different people who were struggling with thoughts of suicide. The opportunity has been nothing short of a blessing.

Five years ago, I was made co-facilitator on an early intervention program for preteens and teens dealing with mild to moderate substance use issues. About a year into my time with the program, I was made lead facilitator. I now manage the program and continue to facilitate multiple monthly groups in Scottsdale and Tempe. It’s an incredibly positive, non-shaming, non-punitive, educational and inspirational program that has helped hundreds of local families not only get their teens back on a healthy path, but learn to communicate with one another in an intentional, proactive, and respectful way. I get to see families, who sometimes aren’t even speaking to one another at the beginning of the first session, reconnect with one another and rise above the issues that have been challenging them.

In September of 2019, I had the opportunity to begin hosting and producing a weekly podcast called “Win This Year.” The show is focused on prevention, mental health, behavioral health, parenting, and other related topics, and our target audience is primarily parents, grandparents, guardians, and those who work with youth. My goal for the show is to be interesting, informative, and inspiring. I feel like we’ve managed to do that so far. Look for the show on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Alexa/TuneIn, Stitcher, IHeartRadio, and most mainstream podcast outlets.

Most importantly, sobriety has allowed me the opportunity to become the type of husband I should have been all along and has given me the chance to be a very good dad to an amazing daughter who was born shortly after my one-year sober date. I give thanks every day for the fact that I got clean and sober before having a child. I owe it to her and my wife to have my act together. Every moment with my daughter is a gift that I never thought I would get. If you had told me when I was in jail that my life would be like this right now, I wouldn’t have believed you though I would have desperately wanted to.

I’m thankful for every chance I get to help other people, to let individuals who are struggling know that they’re not alone, and to destroy the stigma and stereotypes surrounding addiction and recovery. I take every opportunity I get to help people understand that addiction is not a failure of morality, but a behavioral health issue.

If you are struggling, please speak up. Find a trusted, caring, non-judgmental, willing, and ready person and let them know what’s going on. Things can get better, but not until you make the choice to change and move forward. Get connected with local professional resources that can assist you in your recovery. If the situation calls for it, detox correctly and go through residential treatment. If not, consider an intensive outpatient program, or at least 12-step meetings.

Find what works for you, and do it. Surround yourself with positive and caring people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually healthy. Create a support network. Fill your phone with the phone numbers of those on whom you can call when you’re struggling– even if it’s two in the morning. Practice intentional and consistent self-care that includes healthy coping skills and positive outlets. It’s not enough to just NOT use drugs and alcohol, but it’s important to figure out what to replace them with. For me, that includes things like music, writing, art, exercise, hiking, serving others, laughter, meeting new people, and experiencing new things. Find your recipe for success and then make a point to put those pieces in place every single day.

November 29th, 2021 marks ten years of sobriety for me. I’m grateful to even be alive and amazed at the wonderful opportunities I’ve been given. Every morning when I wake up, I give thanks for the tremendous amount of grace I’ve been shown. I’m astounded at how much my life has managed to change for the better in that short amount of time. It makes me excited to see what’s next.

Thank you for taking the time to allow me to share my story with you. I hope it benefits you in some way.

When I was younger, she was like my big sister and looked out for me for years through all my upheavals of growing up. We had a lot of sober friend time when we were younger but later in our friendship, we pretty much drank heavily whenever we were together. It was what we did while bullshitting.

I got sober over a year ago. Even though I got sober, I never expected her to be anything other than who she is, at whatever point she is. But I also didn't hide my recovery journey either because there have been some funny and ridiculous stories I loved sharing with her because she is funny and fun and smart and witty and charming and I love her so much. 

I don't know why I'm posting except to say this: I'm broken-hearted and I miss friend and big sister. Perhaps I'm looking for similar stories, maybe some hope that we can be friends again. Anyone care to share?

I had to learn patience, (life without substances doesn’t offer instant gratification) how to admit I needed help and ask for it, and most importantly, that most of the problem was me. It was difficult at first, but eventually my new way became my instinct. I never thought I could be happy and have fun in recovery, but I was so wrong!

Well, I'm saying i had 10 years because that's how long I went without drinking, but by AA standards, I had 6, because during the last 4 years i didn't drink, I occasionally used psychadelics including sitting in an ayahuasca ceremony for healing purposes. I have a lot of trauma, and I've tried all the things, EMDR, talk therapy, somatic therapy, meditation, 12 step programs, and I have found that psychadelics have been in an extremely useful tool for me in healing some stuff that nothing else could heal. The current research is supporting their usage for trauma so I'm not alone in thinking this can have an impact. I stopped going to meetings for the last 4 years of my alcohol sobriety bc I didn't really feel like I relapsed but I didn't want to lie and say I hadn't used any drugs. Now I'm back after a pandemic drinking relapse. I think I relapsed largely bc I disconnected from AA, which I did largely bc i felt the medicinal aspect of psychadelics was important to me. I do want to be in AA again, but I don't feel like I can promise I'll never use psychadelics again when they've been such a profound tool for me in my recovery from some serious trauma. I don't care if I ever. drink or smoke weed or any of that ever again, but I do feel like after I build up some sober time again, i may want to sit in another ayahuasca ceremony or something. And i guess I'm like, why is this bad, Bill Wilson was literally trying to get LSD to be part of AA bc he thought it could help so much, and current medical research on psychadelics is showing they can help people immensely. I guess I'm asking for advice from people who have thought about this or have experience with it. I already know ""drugs are not part of AA,"" so hoping for perspectives that are a bit more nuanced, especially from people that have at one point or another found psychadelics to be a useful tool for healing.",3

Are there any addicts/alcoholics who have been sober for an extended period of time who decided to have kids and what was your mindset about balancing the risks?


Also I know a lot of staying sober is staying in the herd so to speak, but I could relapse tomorrow for all I know (God willing I won't).

Sweat dripping down my face from being dope sick and thinking about that I’m going to have money to
Buy a pill later !!!! I stuff this thing into my trunk and head to the pawn shop. Carry this biatch into the shop well everyone stares at another addict needing his fix. Guess what they gave me ?? Exactly 30$, enough for one
Pill. Now I call my dealer and remember shjt, I still owe him from the last time. I owed probably 5 different dealers at the time. So I decided to just go look downtown. Took me only 15 mins to find a new connect for the blues. I started breaking it up and damn did it smell like gasoline ?? Well I’m too sick to care. I ended up doing it all at once, I overdosed and was awaken by my ex well I was laying on bathroom floor. It is
Hot as hell in the room and she knows I sold it but she asks anyways. I say “what are u talking about?? It’s gone ???? Someone must of stole it when I passed out. I did all this for 4 hours of not feeling sick. If we put 10% of that work into our recovery, you would be golden",22

Any recovering meth addicts have any advice?,"EDIT: Unfortunately he left in the middle of the night last night. Thank you all for the well wishes and amazing advice. He does need to want this for himself, and I hope soon he can see that. He is so loved. Thank you all, truly. 

My brother is 27 and has been doing some combination of meth and cocaine since he was 20. My family typically hears from him at least once a month, but we went through a four month stretch of radio silence. I’m 21, in college and working two jobs so it’s really difficult for me to find time to do much other than beg my family to do something and find him. 

They basically said it was a lost cause. Finally I got fed the fuck up and drove to Denver, looked for him and finally found and took him home thanks to some tips from his ex. 

He’s been homeless for all four of those months, occasionally being allowed to stay on his exes couch if it was too cold. But it’s freezing out now, and it’s only going to get colder. 

The first day (Wednesday) was hard. He wanted to leave after two hours. He tried to leave and then we took him back home because it was snowing. He wanted to leave two more times but after his dad talked to him on the third time he stayed the whole night. 

I couldn’t sleep, he and I slept on the couch and I just was so scared that when I woke up he’d be gone.

Thanksgiving, most of the day he’s okay but he starting randomly shouting loudly or talking to himself. No biggie, I assume this is due to social isolation after four months of being homeless. But I suffer from BPD so it’s probably easier for me to understand than my family. Coping mechanisms are hard. At the end of the night he got particularly hostile, yelling “Fuck this” and screaming in his room.

Which leads us to this morning. He was laying naked on the couch and had clearly been eating peach cobbler with his hands, and when we told him to get cleaned up and dressed (I have a 16 year old little sister), he began screaming at us to fuck off and that he hates this. 

Recovering is hard and I understand that. He needs patience and support right now. My parents are far less understanding, and are saying he’s doing all of this on purpose to spite them. My mom literally told me “he can go back to sucking cock in an alleyway if he wants to disrespect us like this.” Like what the fuck. 

This infuriated me because when I first found him and brought him home, he kept telling me how embarrassed he was, that he knows this isn’t how he usually is and that he’s ashamed of how his brain is now. 

I want him to get help. Unfortunately he’s 27 and is no longer on our parents insurance. Does anyone have any advice on how to support him better, or resources for my parents? I go back to school in two days, so after that it will just be them watching after him. I’m worried that they’ll make this worse. 

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",65

For the past 15 years I have been in a very dark place, I'm an addict for sure and everything and anything thats addictive I've had a problem with. Alcohol, gambling, pills, sex, food, meth and ghb. 

The meth would be up there with the most damaging thing to me as well as ghb. Last year I had several overdoses, waking up in emergency rooms (ghb). Waking up face down on the road by police, ambulances. Week long benders where I would not eat or sleep and end up needing to be hospitalized. 

Psych ward admissions...psychosis, a dui. I got pretty savagely beat up when I was in a delusional state and robbed, head stomped on. Laughed at by police .. absolute hell. 

Completely demoralised myself, humiliated myself on so many occasions. 

Several month long rehabs only to relapse and lose it all again. 

And the unbearable shame and loneliness I carried with me for a long long time. 

I ended up getting into a long term rehab, stayed it out and I've been about 7 months out of there now. I'm sitting around 14 months clean ..

I have got pretty fit, have a new job (boss only knows me as a reliable hard working person ). Have a pretty good place to stay in a new town. 

On paper everything is ridiculously good. 

I do however still struggle a lot mentally.. I have a lot of pain I'm sitting on. A lot of loneliness..pain around relationships and self esteem 

I got sick this week, ended up on cold and flu tablets and I have been in a real bad place. Terrible moods, depressed, anxious and having massive cravings. I feel like I was so close to using on a few occasions..

I was looking at videos of people smoking meth and shooting up...and my head trying to make plans on how and when I can do it again. 

The thing is...thinking about it, theres no situation I can do it where I don't lose everything I have going..

Theres no way I could just do it for a couple of nights on a weekend..

Even a holiday, it's not enough. It will never be enough. I will never get my fix. The fun Is over... It stopped being fun a long time ago. 

Apart from this week, I haven't been thinking about using. I've been going very fkn good. This week has been a big wake up call. 

I have to recommit to this recovery. I have to be grateful for what I have going that recovery has given me. 

I might keep posting here for a while. 

Life is beautiful... Hope I can share some hope on here.",24

The holidays can be tough on some of us in recovery. Too may opportunities to slip and fall. I've learned a few things over the years and thought I'd share a couple of tips

* Don't back yourself into a corner; meaning don't put yourself in a sticky situation with people, places and things. If your Thanksgiving destination has any of these three things that could cause a problem with your sobriety, at the very least, take an accountability partner (or your sponsor) with you. Most families don't mind and extra mouth on turkey day
* Pick up your phone: call an accountability partner or your sponsor
* Meditate on the steps or scripture or whatever positive thinking quotes you have
* Write a gratitude list. White down at least one thing you are grateful for each day. 
* Stay in community! The opposite of relapse is connection. Attend your meetings, make them a priority! Don't listen to that voice that says ""ah, you don't need a meeting tonight"" We all need to be in community so we don't isolate. 

Add to your plan as you see fit. The most important thing is that you have a plan. Remember, relapse doesn't start when you take that first drink or drug, it's a snowball effect. It starts at the top of that hill with a thought, a compromise. By the time you take that drink or drug, it's too late. 

Hope you all have a safe, fun and healthy holiday! Blessings!",17

Getting and staying sober has allowed me to build a life that is beyond anything I could have possibly imagined. Here are my three main takeaways:

1. Stay humble: There is nothing special about me and other people are not really thinking about me when they do things. I am a person among people; a worker among workers; not some snowflake that deserves special dispensation in situations. I am neither the best nor the worst. I just am.
2. Be honest: with myself and those around me. Not only about ""what happened"" but also about what I like and don't like, my needs, my boundaries, etc.
3. Have integrity: if my thoughts, words, and actions all align then it is far less likely I will hate myself or beat myself up about something. The only thing I *have* to do is the Next Right Thing, whether I think someone is watching or not.

Be safe out there and no matter what happens don't get loaded! Happy Thanksgiving to those in the U.S.

Something that happened awhile ago has really been bothering me. I live in a small town and there isn't a lot of options. I'm still looking for information that may help me. Anyway, this is what I experienced. I hope I am able to share and this is acceptable to talk about.

I went to Oxford treatment center around January 2017 and I feel like I need to tell the story of what happened to me. This place is not here to help you. To give a little insight I was there to get help for kratom because it is considered an opioid by the FDA. I tried finding a doctor around where I live but there were none who would go through medication therapy with someone who wasn't actually on ""drugs"" after my UA came back negative for everything. Of course AAC loved that fact and wanted me to be easy money to line their pockets. I also have a history of chronic depression and anxiety. They made me think I'd be able to take my anxiety medication as needed, that's a lie. They also lied about phone time. I got 10 minutes a day to talk to my loved one's. Pretty crappy when someone has anxiety and it would be nice to hear a familiar voice when you're having panic attacks in the middle of the night. They also only give you withdrawal medication while you're in detox, which is only a week. That is not how suboxone or anything is suppose to work. They totally disregard the fact that people have very uncomfortable long-term withdrawal symptoms that can last months. Good doctors know this and that's why your best hope is to slowly detox with a doctor. They offer no such thing.
During that time in the detox facility it was amazing because of the nurses, beds, showers, and #1 for introverted people, which is privacy. I was able to relax, read a book and not have to do much at all except focus on myself.
After that they flush you out into the general public where you have an itinerary you are mandated to follow, it felt like I was in school again. You also go to meetings and share how badly your life was messed up because of drugs. For myself that wasn't the issue. I never stole from my parents or siblings. I didn't fake my spouses signature on a check for myself. I had a job and it wasn't affecting it at all. My family had no idea but my guilt of doing it behind their backs hurt me. I didn't want to take something every 4 to 6 hours to feel 'normal'. That's literally all I got for those mandatory sessions and they didn't like that I didn't have much to say. For some people talking and being around people constantly might be great but for me it was WAY too much and WAY too soon. Constantly being busy and having to be around people wore me out...
Then a girl died and they stuck me in the cabin she died in, literally sat on the couch she passed away on. Many people talked about how bad this girl was doing beforehand but they didn't call for an ambulance or even try to help her when people expressed their concerns about her. They let her waste away and she died alone. Anyway, it made my depression and anxiety trigger like you couldn't believe and leaving that place is pure hell! I had to beg them for me to call my mom and get my family to get me out of there, I had enough. Of course my family was pissed and had every right to be because if you are alone and have no one to lean on or money, you are screwed! You have to get your own ride off their property, you have to get your own plane ticket. That's extremely difficult since they don't give you your personal belongings until your ride is there to pick you up. They also mail your medications home and I can say they don't do it right away so if you need anxiety meds for that plane ride... Too. Damn. Bad. 

I left after 15 days and that may be why they were so rude to me because I was suppose to stay for 30. Is this something that's normal when someone decided to leave early? 
Even after a few years of thinking about this, I still feel like I deserved empathy and compassion and there were none. I was already overwhelmed and they made things so much more difficult on me. It's very upsetting.",0

**Basic Text, p. 26**

In our addiction, we were afraid of what might  happen if we didn’t control everything around us.  Many of us made up  elaborate lies to protect our use of drugs.  Some of us manipulated  everyone around us in a frenzied attempt to get something from them so  we could use more drugs.  A few of us went to great lengths to keep two  people from talking to each other and perhaps discovering our trail of  lies.  We took pains to maintain an illusion of control over our  addiction and our lives.  In the process, we kept ourselves from  experiencing the serenity that comes with surrender to a Higher Power’s  will.

In our recovery, it is important to release our  illusion of control and surrender to a Higher Power, whose will for us  is better than anything we can con, manipulate, or devise for  ourselves.  If we realize that we are trying to control outcomes and are  feeling afraid of the future, there is action we can take to reverse  that trend.  We go to our Second and Third Steps and look at what we  have come to believe about a Higher Power.  Do we truly believe that  this Power can care for us and restore us to sanity?  If so, we can live  with all of life’s ups and downs—its disappointments, its sorrows, its  wonders, and its joys.

**Just for today:**  I will surrender and let a Higher Power’s will happen in my life.  I will accept the gift of serenity this surrender brings.

My life has improved and I am doing well but lately I can’t shake the desire to smoke again.  It’s been enough time now that I feel like a different person from the one I used to be and even with all those positives I feel I’ve lost something from the days when I was a heavy weed smoker.  I miss my creativity and even just enjoying silly little things or listening to music it just hit differently smoking weed.   I am highly considering going to a dispensary for the first time tomorrow which I think is actually pretty exciting because I’ve never purchased it like that, and buying some marijuana.  I want to think of myself as being someone who is responsible enough now that I won’t begin smoking everyday but who knows how it will go.  I feel like it will be really hard to end my sobriety streak but I have been drinking alcohol in these days and truly I think weed is less harmful then alcohol.

**Basic Text, p. 88**

Many of us attended our first meeting and, not  being entirely sure that NA was for us, found much to criticize.  Either  we felt as though no one had suffered like we had or that we hadn’t  suffered enough.  But as we listened we started to hear something new, a  wordless language with its roots in recognition, belief, and faith: the  language of empathy.  Desiring to belong, we kept listening.

We find all the identification we need as we  learn to understand and speak the language of empathy.  To understand  this special language, we listen with our hearts.  The language of  empathy uses few words; it feels more than it speaks.  It doesn’t preach  or lecture—it listens.  It can reach out and touch the spirit of  another addict without a single spoken word.

Fluency in the language of empathy comes to us  through practice.  The more we use it with other addicts and our Higher  Power, the more we understand this language.  It keeps us coming back.

**Just for today:**  I will listen with my heart.  With each passing day, I will become more fluent in the language of empathy.

I could gobble down a few grams of gabapentin and go to town getting spun, but idk what I'd do honestly, the drug discord is shut down and my friends all have lives. So I'd just be jaw locked and lonely, dog.

I am a 28 year old female with SEVERE mental illness and a laundry list of diagnosis. I am also a recovering heroin addict. I'm currently in treatment where I see professionals daily to get my medication to treat my OUD. I previously moved here from a state where I was legitimately prescribed cannabis and it was helping treat my mental illness, allowing me to live a normal and healthy life. I have continued this medication even though it's illegal on my state, I still have ways of obtaining it from legitimate sources where it is legally available. This is usually sustainable for me but I have recently ran into financial issues where I haven't been able to get my medication and my mental health has been on a rapid decline since (roughly 3 weeks). I live in my mother's apartment (she forced me) with her, my little brother, my fiance and my 9mo old daughter. Shes noticed this decline and is using it as an excuse to have me committed to a rehab or psychiatric hospital against my will. I do have a history of self harm that she can use as a requirement to have me committed and since my medication is illegal in this state, I fear she may be able to claim that I've relapsed ( I havent). What are my rights here? What can I do to protect myself? What actions could I take?
EDIT: I would like to add that otherwise I am doing very well. I have a very good job (that I'll lose if she does this) and my recovery has been extremely successful this go around (almost a year; longest I've ever had). I feel like an involuntary commitment would set back my progress immensely.",6

With the help of rehab, AA and counseling, I was able to quit all substances. But after about 2 years of heavy involvement in the program, I realized a lot of it was fucked up and was actually preventing me from moving forward in life. 

AA taught me that I was condemned to living a life as a hopeless addict. It taught me to NOT trust myself and to instead rely on others to tell me what was best for me. It taught me that I HAD to go to AA, or else I would certainly relapse like the sick addict that I am. It taught me I was doomed to fail, and that I must fear the almighty drug at all times, no matter how much work I put in.

I’m sorry but who exactly is that helping? Shouldn’t we be teaching newbies how to live right and ultimately how to trust themselves again? I was falling away from the program, NOT because I wanted to relapse, but because I was tired of being told what to think, how to feel, and who I was. 

There is this mindset in the recovery community that we CAN’T talk about what is wrong with the program because it might steer someone away. Well, if the truth steers them away, then maybe the program needs improvement. AA/NA are not the only options out there but they’re almost exclusively the only ones talked about at rehabs, on the internet, etc.

Let’s be real - AA/NA doesn’t work for most people. I think it’s time we start being honest about the facts and start pouring our energy into better methods of recovery with higher, measurable success rates.

I was medicated with paroxetine and lamotrigine which I stopped taking a couple of years ago, having assumed that the real problem was my drug and alcohol use.

and fall to the ground.

I can fight it off because I’m sober, because I’m strong enough to push it away from me. I am not weathered and worn from daily consumption.

**Basic Text, p. 26**

How do we begin the process of letting our  Higher Power guide our lives?  When we seek advice about situations that  trouble us, we often find that our Higher Power works through others.   When we accept that we don’t have all the answers, we open ourselves to  new and different options.  A willingness to let go of our preconceived  ideas and opinions opens the channel for spiritual guidance to light our  way.

At times, we must be driven to the point of  distraction before we are ready to turn difficult situations over to our  Higher Power.  Anxiously plotting, struggling, planning, worrying—none  of these suffice.  We can be sure that if we turn our problems over to  our Higher Power, through listening to others share their experience or  in the quiet of meditation, the answers will come.

There is no point in living a frantic  existence.  Charging through life like the house is on fire exhausts us  and gets us nowhere.  In the long run, no amount of manipulation on our  part will change a situation.  When we let go and allow ourselves access  to a Higher Power, we will discover the best way to proceed.  Rest  assured, answers derived from a sound spiritual basis will be far  superior to any answers we could concoct on our own.

**Just for today:**  I will let go and let my Higher Power guide my life.

I first got sober March 2019 and stayed clean and sober of ALL mind altering substances for well over a year and a half. Everything was going so well until September of 2020 I developed panic disorder.. it was the scariest most debilitating thing and I had no control over it whatsoever and it scared the living hell out of me. I sought professional help. Got prescribed Prozac and when I initially started taking it one of the side m effects was increased panic / anxiety so I couldn’t continue on it long enough to see results at the time. I lost hope. I was like I finally got sober and now I developed severe panic disorder out of nowhere? I was the most extroverted, people loving, social butterfly and my panic disorder became so debilitating I couldn’t do basic simple day to day tasks. Eventually I remember Xanax / Benzos help anxiety took some of my mother in laws (didn’t count it as relapse because I really needed it, actually) to make a long story short that led me to get lorezapam prescription which turned to abuse and then I sought more benzos out (not prescribed) and still considered myself sober because “I needed them for my anxiety” and it’s not my DOC so that counts as sober. Well that has caused me to spiral daily benzo use, I’ve been drinking, and I relapsed on my DOC not once, not twice but 3 times. My husband caught me 2 out of the 3… one being today and I honestly have never felt more guilty in my life. It’s a disease sure but after you know enough it’s also a conscious choice. Recovery is such a huge deal to him and it just broke his heart and disappointed him which is just like a stab in my heart, like all the air in my lungs has been knocked out, knot in my stomach heavy heart. This disease makes us so selfish and self centered we don’t even think about how it will effect everyone around us. The people we love the *most* I do not ever want to look back……… please wish me luck and send positive vibes this way…… I need it 😞😓",16

I have been so strong and committed in my recovery journey recently or so I thought. I was put on an adhd medication two months ago that I was terrified of because of its addictive properties. I talked to so many people and my sponsor about me being terrified of not being sober still when taking it. I did not want to have to high of a dose on accident and no longer be able to say I’m sober. 6 days ago I just took one extra pill an hour after the original dose. I wasn’t scared I wasn’t thinking it kinda just happened. I sat in my couch 3 hours later and realized 
what I did and felt so much shame and guilt. I felt defeated and began to just eat them like candy through the day. I am terrified of telling anyone. I have sponsees I have a sponsor friends and family that I will have to tell and see there face. I am currently in the mountains and am heading home later tonight. I’m really scared of going home now. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated I want to post this here because I really need help and advice. Thank you",19

There was a guy I know there, coming back around, still trying to get a day. He has family who hasn't been speaking much with him for as long as I known him. It eats him up and I get it. I'm just realizing what I forgot to say when I shared.

I've been on both sides of that fence. I had a brother struggling with this disease. The pain of watching a loved one fight and/or fall victim to this struggle is something no one should have to experience. The range of emotions it puts you through is immensely vicious. I'll never forget the complete insanity I felt from the relief of knowing he wasn't going to die along with the pain of imagining him sitting in a jail cell. Hearing him talk about thinking we would all be better off if he just died, sometimes thinking myself that I just wished the misery would end will literally break you heart.

He never found the recovery that I have today. He lost his battle in 2018. I absolutely guarantee you that no matter how steadfast I was with different feelings in the past, the past is the past. There is not, and will not be, a single day I wake up and think the world is a better place without him.

Time heals all wounds. No matter how much of burden anyone reading this might think they are, just get a day. Then get another one. Anything and everything can get better.",12

Have near constant restlessness and a never-ending desire to self medicate. Need help.,"I really need some help guys. I'd been drinking every day like 7-10 drinks but often like a whole bottle of vodka which was my go-to. Got sober in 2020 but didn't last until the end of the year. Relapsed and was drinking like 2-3 bottles of wine every day until I finally got tired of it again and quit in March of this year. It's been fucking hard but I kinda fucked up by getting back into weed after like a month off alcohol. Started with edibles which I did every day. Lately I was using a THC concentrate pen (the thing with the cartridges and stuff) and vaping constantly throughout the day each day for a few weeks. I realized that it was making me super lazy (I have ADHD which doesn't help there) and made me crave alcohol again because the THC didn't feel like enough anymore. I threw out the vape and carts two days ago.

So now I'm left with the constant restlessness again and the never-ending desire to self-medicate. Shit...even loads of coffee and soda helps. It feels impossible to sit with myself even just at my computer (which I'm on for most of the time every day) or do anything not too stimulating. I was just diagnosed in March with ADHD for the first time and I haven't quite found a medication that works except for ritalin, which worked too well to the point where I was slightly abusing it because of how calm and peaceful it made me feel. I keep going back to substances though because I can't handle the restlessness. I guess I figure that it comes from the ADHD which is why I rationalize the self-medicating. Cuz then it's a permanent condition and it won't get better until I find the right med right? So what's the point in being abstinent if I'm just going to continue to suffer? Right? Or is this perhaps from the lingering effects of abusing alcohol and weed for years? In which case I need to just get through it and it will improve? I don't exercise or eat too well. I really am not very active. It definitely is worse when I'm not doing anything but sitting at my computer. It's hard to get myself to do anything else. I need help...it's just this endless cycle at this point..

She completely rightfully said she was done. I don't even know why I did it...I saw it and got overwhelmed with the feeling of needing it so I tried.

Now, with a clear mind and a clear goal, I was able to write something I'm proud of, and she encouraged me to share it with people. It's very much in my voice and very personal. **There is section towards the end that talks about suicide, so trigger warning**. Anyway, here it is:

ADIOS, YOU BITCH
Or
HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE MYSELF

Oh hey there. Yeah, sorry I've been away for so long (not even 60 days). No, no I didn't miss you, but you've been on my mind. No, you shouldnt be smiling. You really, really shouldn't be smiling. I mean, I haven't been smiling when I think of you. Honestly, I think we should break up, and I'll tell you why. Good god please don’t start crying.

We've been together for a long time. Like, almost a decade now. And remember when we first met, when I was 15? I didn't know a whole lot about you then, and we had that brief fling, and I wish I could just go back and warn that 15 year old me about you, what you were going to do to me, how you were going to hurt me, toy with me, control me. Yes, yes you're right. There were some good times. I mean, you were there for me after all, many times. You were there for me at the worst of times, the bad times. Remember when we first really started seeing each other? It was right after V broke up with me and I went to that party and she was there and I was so nervous and scared and full of shame but you were there at that party too, and we pretty much hung out all night together, and the next morning when I woke up, you were there too, and I didn't know it then but that's when I started falling in love with you.

So, yeah, after that was when we really started our relationship. We started out seeing each other a couple times a week, and remember how sneaky we had to be? There was a lot of fun in that too. Remember? I had to wait till everyone was asleep to let you in, and we'd spend the night together, and in the morning it hurt when you were gone, and I would feel it all day, just yearning for our next time together. Like the way the song goes, ""you were always on my miiiiiiind!"". Lol. Wait, don't laugh, this isn't supposed to be funny.

Anyway, when I look back now I see when our relationship really started affecting my life as a whole. I started going to community college but I still spent most of my time with you. I would skip class, skip homework, just so we could be together. I never did end up graduating with a degree, remember? We had been together for about four or five years at that point. And in the meantime, leading up to that point, I was spending all of my money on you, like I was literally going into debt just to be with you. And ya know what? It started to become a chore just to be with you at that point. I was neglecting my health, my finances, my social life, fucking everything. Because of you.

Now, this part you're well aware of because it's the first time we broke up, and which would lead to a series of breakups and getting back together and breaking up again and so on and so forth. You remember. I was 25. I was working at NS as a dishwasher (some real glamorous shit) and our relationship started to get really, really toxic. I stopped coming to work because you demanded my attention; my mental health and my physical health degrading at a rapid pace. I managed to keep it from you because whenever I was with you all that shit would go away because you made me all warm and fuzzy inside and it was so comforting to just be laying in bed with you by my side, just a reach away. Babe, you took away all the bad feelings and emotions but god dammit you were the source of the bad feelings and emotions. I was fucking stuck! If I continued to be with you, I was gonna get more sick, and if I stopped seeing you, I would get more sick! That's when it came to a head and I broke it off with you. I went to a place that helped people that suffered from the same abusive relationship we had. When I got out of there I felt so much better about life, but I still was in love with you. It didn't take long before I came back to you, remember? And we spent that week together in my car, and you warmed me up because it was snowing out. At that time, I was grateful to be back with you, but I realized my love for you was wrong, but I couldn't resist it. I just couldn't, honey.

By that point, my family was really involved in our relationship. My Mom hated you especially. You never saw it but I would tell you about it, and you would comfort me, me realizing now that was like hitting my hand with a hammer then going back for more and being oblivious as to why I have a broken hand. Anyway, it was like when I was young again, we had to start hiding our relationship, and we had to come up with more and more clever ways to see each other. Sometimes I would walk to your place at night, sometimes early in the morning. Sometimes we would hang out and sleep together in the woods, which sounds fun but when I look back on it, it was awful. 

So occasionally my family would step in and demand I go back to that place that helps people out. And I would reluctantly go, because they usually gave me no other option. And when I got to those places everything they were telling me and everything I was doing started to make sense, and I was actually enjoying being without you. I could smile without your help. I could fall asleep without you in bed next to me. And everyone was telling me how important it was for my life to no longer be in this abusive relationship with you anymore, and I believed them, about 90%. 

When it was time for me to go back out in the world, I would start living life and it would go OK, but not great. After a bit, maybe a month, I would be driving around and I would see you (because you're goddamn everywhere) and I would think, “Hmmm…”, just that at first. Then a few days would go by and I’d think, “Hmmm...what if I…?” and then I would stop myself, remembering what everyone told me, but I still felt a little tickle in the back of my brain and an electric feeling in my legs, just a hint, enough to ignore but not enough to make it go away, because it felt good to think about you in a dirty way. Then one day I saw you and I said, “Fuck it” and then we were R E U N I T E D and before you know it my life was in the garbage again. Rinse and repeat over the span of three years and that brings us up to now.

So, the last time we had another one of our flings was when I was living in Seattle and no family was around to stop us from being together, so we let it rip! We were constantly together! Every night we were sleeping together now, and we were together in the morning too, it was magical. Hell, you even came to work with me and helped me get through my shifts. Yeah, it was definitely magical, magically fucked up. Don’t laugh at that! I started to neglect my health again, and my job, and my finances, and I even stopped showering (gross), and I got really sick.  And then on June 30th something weird happened. You weren’t making me happy anymore, you weren’t curing my sickness like I thought you were, and when I felt I needed you the most, I couldn’t have you, and my life was falling apart, and I had this sense of impending doom that I created for myself, and I decided I didn’t want to be around for it. 

So I tried to kill myself. You weren’t around to see it. You weren’t there to see me calling 911 in a panic, thinking I was going to die any minute. You didn’t see the police cars, the firetrucks, and ambulances that showed up (looking back it seems like overkill). You weren’t with me those five days I spent in the hospital, hallucinating for two days in a white room while someone watched me 24/7. You weren’t there, but I was thinking of you. I thought about you a lot. And I made the choice I should have made a long time ago; I decided, and it was my choice, to finally get you out of my life, because you almost took it from me. I got the help I needed from wonderful people that truly understand me, and I’m being taken care of, and that's why I’m here doing this with you right now. 

Go ahead and taunt me all you want. Yes, yes I know I’ll be seeing you around. You’re in every store, every gas station, sometimes on billboards. Almost everybody in America loves you. And you know what? That’s really good news for you, because now you can go find someone else to love, and fuck their life up too. Hopefully I’ll meet them before it gets too bad, and I’ll try to help them get rid of you. So goodbye, you wicked bitch of a liquid. I always thought weed was better anyway.",14

His dealer had run out of Roxies. I didn't have access to Roxies, but I told him I could get him some heroin from my dealer. I sent a text. Waited forever to hear back, drove across town, waited so long that I had to go home since I'd promised to be back at a certain time. I gave the number to my friend and told him to pick up for both of us. That was the last time we spoke.

He died of a heroin overdose early in the morning on October 14. Nobody was talking about how he died. People try to hide when someone dies of an overdose. But I knew. Had he died in a car accident or anything else, people would say what happened.

The year after was the worst of my entire life. The guilt, the panic attacks, wanting to die sometimes, terrified to die other times. Trying to quit using, relapsing. I managed to kick heroin using suboxone and suboxone by just tapering myself off because of the side effects. Meth tho. Meth was a real problem.

This year, the night of October 12, I wanted to die. I'd never so badly wanted to die. Meth was making me miserable. It was taking everything. I was going to lose everything I loved. In the morning of October 13, I decided I wasn't willing to ever EVER spend another day of my life addicted. Which left me with two options. So later on that day, I went to a meeting. It's been about a month and I haven't used since October 13. My first full day of recovery is this year on October 14.

I am determined to keep that date and my commitment to never spend a day of my life addicted. I am in IOP, I attend three SMART meetings a week and one Recovery Dharma meeting. This past week, I've managed to cut my drinking down to one beer on Tuesday, a far cry from the glass of wine I was having every night before bed. I'm going to the gym. I'm working on quitting vaping. I'm starting to look for a job. I'm figuring out all my bills and all the things that were just too difficult to figure out while I was high. I'm getting my life back and I'm getting healthy.

Last year, October 13, I made a choice that contributed to the death of my friend. This year, on October 13, I decided to live. I'll never be able to undo the past, but I can do my best to never make those same choices and to live the way he'd have wanted me to live. He spent so many years in recovery. He was doing so well until all the meetings went onto Zoom. Had he lived, he'd have worked hard to get back into recovery as I'm doing. So I'm not just doing recovery for myself but for both of us since he can no longer do it himself.",44

2021-11-11 18:17:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/qrxrtg/relapsed_a_month_ago_and_it_significantly_messed/,Relapsed a month ago and it significantly messed up my progress.,"More than a year ago I was an extreme poly-addict. I'd take anything I could get my hands on, and usually get dependent or addicted until I ran out.

My drugs of choice where metonitazene, lots of different types of benzos, hypnotics, quaalude analogues, ghb, regular amphetamine, a-php and n-ethyl-hexedrone (unpopular opinions i know). I used a shit ton of other drugs, randomly also.

Over the last few years I'd been slowly kicking all of them until I was completely clean around february this year. It took a real crisis (the metonitazene addiction) to make me realize I needed to take indefinite leave from work and get help. The help never came and I ended up withdrawing thrice on my own, aborting on day 1 twice, then succesfully the third time. Which happened to be the most painful withdrawal experience of my life to the point that I had a hallucinatory experience where I thought God was explaining creation to me in a very zen-like way but telling me: change now or perish. I was not religious previously, just spiritual, but now I'm a bit more convinced there's more than meets the eye..

After that I slowly started working on my health. Diet to get back to strength, then walking more and more, then running more and more, then taking up boxing.

Fast forward to a month ago. It's a time in which the stress of my father revealing a cancer diagnosis, combined with the stress of starting therapy, the boredom of not being able to work or meaningfully contribute to society and thus feeling useless, plus winter coming on which always puts my depression on a logarithmic scale.. And then, out of nowhere (i thought I had blocked them all) a promotion e-mail from a clearnet vendor stating 'buy now, will be banned soon!'.. this, in the vulnerable moment I was in, caused me to cave and order a bunch of n-ethyl-hexedrone. Just for old times, right? A little vape here and there..

Well, I vaped it all non-stop (as was expected by anyone rational) and two weeks later I was completely psychotic. Now I've been psychotic before, but this was psychotic v6.0, something so scary I'm still putting the puzzle pieces together. Some very dark, evil themes, not normally in my minds content, that I do not wish to mention, but it significantly affected my feelings of security in my neighborhood, and thereby completely ruined the feeling of being at home in my own home.

I was full on yelling and cursing at the ""neighbors"" and the ""maffia guy who would kill me if I alerted LE because he had 15000kg of amphetamine stashed away at home"" and the ""dirty cop who would kill me in my sleep"" and the ""initially mediating girlfriend of the maffia guy who later turned nasty too, talking about a possible random gang-style liquidation one day"" through the walls.. It made me react like a very scary and dangerous person, which in reality I am absolutely not unless provoked which in this case was a fact to me in my psychotic state.

I was thus loudly claiming to have weapons ready for a firefight (in a European country where this is illegal) which was nonsense, and claimed to have an advanced, self-designed security system, challenging them to try me and that I'd kill them. I'm very handy with tech, so the security system part was partially true, be it that it is not that advanced of a system, just recording anomalous audio events in my home at weird times. But the frequency spectrum plot showed things to me in those moments that in reality were just noise and not there.

I at one point threatened to burn their house to the ground due to the perceived escalation of their threats, as they told me they had a camera full of pictures of me in let's just say naked (stim-fapping) situations.. that they would release to my colleagues, all that jazz. Yeah, classy.. cathinones and PVs make you a retarded porn addict. But none of it was real of course. Except for me it took 2 weeks to realize this completely. To be fair, I still look over my shoulder.. due to all the death threats.

All of my built up physical and mental gains over almost a year had been lost, I had to sleep at a friends place for more than a week until I was semi-functional again and I don't feel my antidepressants anymore (probably because I fucked up my dopamine circuits). My brain feels like I've done serious damage to memory formation and recall, my lungs don't feel right, my stamina has tanked, I have become extremely lethargic and anhedonic.. I also am just beginning to realize that with everything that's going on, I'm just not able to put my energy and quite frankly spirit into the therapy, for which I'd been waiting 5!!! years since when I first realized I needed help. I'm secretly and now not so secretly, finding this therapy form to be not what I expected it to be and not something I see myself prolonging much further - perhaps switching to another form.

I feel utterly fucked. Being able to go back to work at some point (well-paying job, good colleagues and they take great care of their employeees, even ones like me) depends on this therapy, but I need to visit my father and family who live overseas, I booked the flight and won't sacrifice that for anything. Haven't seen my overseas family in years and in some cases decades and feel like this is a maybe last chance situation. But I've already missed so much of the therapy due to random things (ADHD-fails being a contributor) that I anticipate this will probably be the nail in the coffin as far as the therapists are concerned.. Apart from that I haven't been truly happy at my job in years, but stayed because of the colleagues and the safety for weirdos like me., plus the company holds a special place in my heart. Yet.. perhaps it's time to face some fears and try something new? 

I'm at a loss. I'm not fighting an urge to start using again or anything, but I fear I am about to lose everything, have no clue what my options are, I'm flat, flat broke and in debt, and becoming homeless most certainly will put me back in that coping mechanism of reaching for some dopamine excess..

I need some encouragement. Has anyone here, in recovery, with maybe a relapse, but in a shitty situation overall, managed to get their life back? I am completely incompatible with NA so please don't suggest that. Any other things to consider? I'm in Western Europe by the way, excellent safetynet, but I'm dangerously close to reaching its limits.

I was going down to visit a friend I met at uni who had got kicked out by a girl he was dating. We drove around and he offers me a line of speed. I thought that one line wouldn't hurt.
We ended up on a 48 hour binge of ecstasy, alcohol and speed where we graffitied his apartment and partied. It was one of the funniest weekends I've had in a long time, I'm not going to lie. But we ended up in a fight at a party at 4am and when we we're going to leave we noticed that his backpack was stolen with his medication.

I really miss weekends like this, but I don't miss what drugs do too people over a long time. It gave me a reminder of why I choose to become sober and cut ties with my childhood friends.",4

I am an alcoholic and will have 8 months in a couple days.  I'm doing really well and absolutely seeing the blessings of sobriety.  A little background - I've been around AA for 6+ years.  I say ""around"" because I started going to meetings after my first trip to rehab, but I never fully committed to AA or working on my sobriety.  As a result, until now I had only brief periods of sobriety (1 -2 months a few times).  

My question centers on sponsorship.  I've had a sponsor for the bulk of these 8 months.  I certainly see the benefit of sponsorship and I do believe it is essential for me to have that support and guidance.  However, we've reached a point where I notice a clear difference of opinion on how I am working to maintain my sobriety.  I got sober in AA and will continue to ""work the program"".  I rely heavily on the principles of the Big Book and without AA I would not be sober.  That said, with my spiritual growth I am relying more and more heavily on material that is outside of what is blessed by AA.  Specifically, I've turned to many authors like Thomas Merton, Henri Nouwen, Richard Rohr (all Catholic priests) to grow my closeness to God.  The ""spiritual experience"" discussed in AA is very real to me and that is the reason I've turned to other writings.  

My sponsor is clearly put off by this - he has made several subtle comments about ""approved"" literature.  When I developed my relationship with him I didn't think he was an AA zealot, but I've grown uncomfortable with how he views my supplemental reading.  For me it is so clear how the concepts of surrender, acceptance, release, letting go of the false self, discernment, etc.... I read about in these other sources go hand in hand with the principles of AA.  

In short, this is a problem for me.  After all, even Bill Wilson relied very heavily on Fr. Dowling in his walk through the early years.  

I hope I've explained this well enough for any reader to understand where I am.  I appreciate any thoughts the community may have.",25

my friend went home the day after and then i went back home. for a couple days i was thinking about the so called ‘china white’. eventually i got really curious, i had another buddy of mine come visit and made him buy some china white which was only 2.50$ (50 pesos) for a little bag on the street. we bought and smoked some and it was great just like fent. he went home after a couple days. and i didn’t go back for more. until after a week or two.

it was 4 weeks ago i went downtown Tijuana which is really close to my house to buy some china white by myself. it was surprisingly so easy, easier then finding weed to buy out there. after asking a few guys i quickly obtained a plug and bought some. i went in my car and got out foil and a tutor and packed it. it was my first time ever trying a opioid or something so strong by myself before that wasn’t offered too me so i was quite nervous.
then i smoked ,  i loved it. it was great , so great and relaxing, i quickly lit a cig and enjoyed. i went home and smoked some more. a couple days later, i went agin, that was 4 weeks ago. now i go and pick up 2-4 bags every 2-3 days now. it only costs me anywhere between 5-10 dollars for it. it’s so affordable and so great. i’ve done lots of drugs before , since i was 13. but not like this. i’m starting to get worried, i hear the stories and everything about fentanyl. & now i do it almost daily. i’m so young and i’m just really scared okay… this drug has relaxed me and comforted me in ways i never imagined and i’ve actually been quite happy these past few weeks. but i know something is not right.. i’m still depressed and i’m so emotionally ruined. i’m the youngest boy of 6 sisters and 1 brother, completely misunderstood by society and i’m stuck w only my father  in a country that i don’t belong in. now i’m using hard drugs to fill the void in my heart this life has caused me.. i don’t know what to do somebody please help me.",14

I think I’m posting this under a username different from what I previously used and I doubt anyone will remember this but that’s okay.  I wanted to come here and thank each and every one of you for being here. I’ve spent most of the last decade in recovery from a wicked heroin and cocaine addiction that stole my teenage years and well into early adulthood. But those days were behind me, or so I thought.  When Covid hit, I lost my job, I found myself in a new state where I knew literally nobody except for my roommate who worked graves at the VA hospital so I never saw him.Then four of my closest friends died of overdoses in a row. I couldn’t find a job I couldn’t find a purpose anymore I was so lonely and sad and broken and then my partner cheated on me with a girl from the rehab I sent him to. Again. So then I lost my relationship with someone I loved more than anyone in the universe….and I relapsed. HARD.  I didn’t mean for it to get so out of hand but we all know how that goes. In a matter of weeks I had destroyed what little was left of my shell of a life, I was seriously contemplating throwing in the towel and leaving this plane of existence so I wouldn’t have to hurt so much anymore. I had no insurance, no money, nothing.   Through a series of incredibly lucky events and the help of friends I’ve made along the way in my recovery, both professionally and personally, I was able to get a bed in a residential facility on 100% scholarship. But here’s the catch - it was quite literally on the Entire other side of the country. I was living in Portland Oregon at the time and the place was in New Jersey and I had no fucking idea how I was going to get there and every dollar I had seem to go back into my arm. I missed two flights and with it, the couple hundred dollars that were my literal ticket out of hell.   I came here. I was out of options. I was humiliated. I HATE asking for help. It’s all very blurry in my memory For obvious reasons so I’m not 100% sure that this is the sub I talked to anybody on but I think it is. Regardless, I told people on Reddit what was happening and through their kindness and generosity I got another ticket and made it on that goddamn plane.    That was May 5th. I’ve maintained my recovery ever since. I wanted to come and say thank you because you guys saved my life. I’m not being hyperbolic. Without the help of reddit and the really amazing people that can be found on here if you’re looking in the right places, I am Absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt sure I would not be alive right now, whether by choice or accident, it became one in the same anyway.   It is because of you guys I have what I have today. Even the plane ticket aside, the overwhelming support I received from so many people still makes me cry to think about. The Internet can be a very cruel place and while of course there were always going to be people saying mean things, any comments of that nature were vastly outweighed by genuine caring and compassion. It wasn’t just the money for the plane ticket. It was the words of encouragement, love, and camaraderie that got me to the airport. That gave me the courage to do the thing I thought I’d never have to do again.  Never underestimate the impact the smallest of gestures can have on a person’s life.  Thank you all so much.",36

She’s glad that it’s helping me “address and shift some painful shit” in my life and getting more support for my mental health and trauma and finding supportive women to have authentic connections with but doesn’t really believe addiction is a disease that I really really need help with, definitely doesn’t realize it’s a life or death matter for me.

She is an all day everyday cannabis user so maybe Me going sober makes her feel subconsciously self conscious about her own use.

Regardless, I’m disappointed and sad and hurt that she hasn’t been a big support with this because she has been with so many other things. 

I feel like she should know what a problem I have because she’s seen me go to the hospital twice, overdose on drugs, get assaulted, black out, wake up in strangers beds having no idea how I got there, have alcohol induced psychosis, endanger my kids lives, etc… but it doesn’t really faze her.

I know I will need to work on this resentment toward her but I also feel like distancing myself from her. I feel like she’s a threat to my recovery right now.

I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the nuance of ""it gets easier"". Sure, that's the direction it trends in. But there's still hard days, even now, several years out. It helps that I left the place I spent most of my addiction in, so it's not like I can just call up and old friend and score anymore. I have no ""connections"" here, so even in my weakest moments it's enough of a roadblock to stop me...usually the feeling passes in a day or two.  


But I've just had a string of ""bad days"". Been a really bad couple months for my mental health, a lot of things that would have sent me over the edge in my early recovery journey.

I have a psychiatrist (and I’m currently medicated which is helping) but I do not have a therapist, which I desperately need.

I’ve asked my Psych and Primary for recommendations but I don’t get much back or it doesn’t work out for one reason or another.

Packing for 90 day rehab ❤️,"❤️ To all those that warned me, I apologize. Those who stood behind me, thank you. Nature took it’s course. With a warm heart, I’m sorry for the choices I made and am appreciative to those who’ve been there and tried. It didn’t go unnoticed ❤️

Today, I began packing my one piece of luggage and one carry on bag that is somehow supposed to hold enough of my shit to last through my 90 day grippy sock vacation. I’m headed to a dual diagnosis treatment center near New Orleans to treat a nasty meth addiction. Been using orally damn near every day for 2.5 years and it’s destroying every facet of my life. 

I’m a 32 yr old female and have quiet borderline personality disorder, CPTSD, major depressive disorder and anxiety. It all appears to trace back to childhood trauma- abandonment issues from being placed in the foster system as a young child. My sister and I hopped from home to home until we ended up in an abusive home for a while.

I started using drugs when I was 13. Coke, weed, a little meth, ecstasy pills, Xanax bars, and alcohol. I didn’t discriminate. Heavy on the Xanax through high school, taking sometimes up to 7 or 8 bars in a day. As a 5’4”, 120 lb female, I probably should have quit breathing in my sleep on numerous occasions. I barely graduated due to attendance issues, but I got very high ASVAB scores. I know if I didn’t get out of this shitty southern town, I was gonna end up overdosed or in jail. I joined the Air Force. 

I cleaned up my act and really excelled in the military. I won a ton of awards, even one of the most prestigious awards the Air Force has—I was one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year. Long story short, I decided to finish up my enlistment and separate from the military. I had a MST (military sexual trauma) happen to me and ended up with a bad taste in my mouth due to how I was treated by the military afterwards. My husband at the time and I planned a baby, had said baby, and I got out of the military. We moved to Colorado and I went to college for a couple years while taking care of our son. I felt like I “should” have been “happy” at this point in my life…24, married to a man that loved me, a baby, in college and financially stable. Alas, this was not the case and I didn’t understand what was happening to me, just that I needed the pain to stop.

Everything my husband did started to get on my last nerve. They way he cleared his throat would make my blood boil. I quietly suffered from increasing depression and irritability and started to envision hanging myself from our second floor banisters. I was miserable. 

Despite my internal struggles, I was making good grades in school and my previous military award helped make me look great on paper. I decided to apply for a couple badass internships, just to see what would happen. I applied for one at the White House and to my surprise, made it through all the rounds of interviews and red tape. I had something to look forward to now and clung to that spark of hope for dear life. I even decided to go see my family doctor and ask for help with my depression symptoms. I had no formal mental health diagnosis at this time and had never even heard of borderline personality disorder.

I had been sober now for about 7 years, give or take. In hindsight, I should have turned down the huge Ativan prescription my doc offered, knowing I had a serious benzo problem in the past. That piece of paper for 120 Ativan a month (with a number of refills), was likely a contributing factor to the fucked up decisions I was going to make in the near future. 

I took out a $10k loan and rented a small apartment in DC for my 6 month internship. Soon as I got there I was able to breathe a sigh of relief for some reason, and it was confusing to me. I felt guilty for feeling better because I should have felt worse not being with my husband and 2 year old. I started abusing the pills and had a great time working at the White House, however I am ashamed because I don’t remember my time there as well as I wished I did. I also didn’t work as hard as I could have and feel like I squandered one of the best opportunities I’d probably ever have. 

After about four months there, I met a guy on Tinder and fell hard. My husband back home was 11 years older and a super traditional Filipino family man. We met when I was 18 and he was like 30. I never got to party or do anything “exciting” in my adult life, until I left for DC. I felt so free now and I think I tricked myself into thinking I was happy. I started to realize I didn’t want to go back home to Colorado. 

I literally never went back. I fucking abandoned my family and caused so much pain. I will never forgive myself and I don’t expect my son and ex to forgive me either. Biggest regret of my life.

I started drinking a ton and taking adderall too, in addition to my Ativan. My new man was a narcissist, but I didn’t know what that was yet. Oh my lord, we were passionate about everything. My ex was boring so this was heaven to me. We even moved to Manhattan together to work for a startup company he and his college friend invented.

Things became toxic, which eventually progressed to abusive. I took so much adderall and worked so much that it started taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I got super skinny and started hearing music that was not there. It was very quiet, almost indistinguishable, but I could make the music change depending on what I wanted it to sound like. I also started self harming and had a suicide attempt around this time. I started to seek mental health help and was told a couple different diagnoses, even schizophrenia by a doctor I met with one time only, but nothing really seem to fit. After a couple of years with the narcissist, the cheating and the lies and abuse became too much to bear and I left. I moved to Austin, TX.

I’m gonna fast track this story for the next five years and give only a brief synopsis. I just smoked weed daily for this time and was moderately happy. I also got my borderline diagnosis and this is when I started to really become more self aware. It helped me to give a reason (not an excuse) to my impulsive behaviors, chronic emptiness and “splitting” that seems to ruin all of my relationships. 

I moved back to Manhattan with a different boyfriend, because clearly I must learn my lessons more than once. Two years later, I called my momma sobbing, asking her if I can please come home. The physical abuse was getting worse and worse each fight and I was scared at this point. He pulled my hair so severely that I couldn’t raise my eyebrows without my scalp hurting badly and my arms were covered in bruises.

Two days later I packed my car and left that man crying on the doorstep. I drove the 24 hour drive back to my hometown.

I thought my life was over and I was a failure for coming back home. What can seem like the worst thing in the world, however, can actually be a blessing in disguise. I am grateful for what happened to me in NY, because without it, I never would have been back home for what was about to happen to my mom. Which also happened to be my downfall.

My mom was my heart. My best friend and a piece of my soul. I was her and she was me. She had been around 350 lbs my whole life and had health issues. She went for surgery for AFIB, but something went wrong and she was on a ventilator for three days. My stepdad, my sister, and I thought we lost her, but she survived. She ended up losing all of her strength however, and couldn’t walk, use the restroom on her own, even reposition her own legs properly. She tried her hardest in short term rehab to get stronger but it wasn’t working. She was in the ICU probably about four times in the next six months and almost died each time. I spent the night by her side every single night, sleeping in a chair for over three of the six months before she died, taking care of her every need, cheering her up and advocating for her. 

It’s exhausting and unsustainable to be present 24/7 like that. Especially while trying to work, I owned a small business at the time. I started orally taking small bits of meth to give me energy. 

I watched her bleed out enough from her rectum to produce a pool of blood around her hospital bed, watched her cry out in agony more times than I can count, and said my goodbyes to her more than once when doctors said she was going to die. I also became aware of abuse and neglect against her while she was at a nursing home in between hospital stays. I wasn’t allowed to stay the night with her there, but I sure as shit began popping in at all hours of the day and night to do random checks on my mom. 3 am, 3 pm, it didn’t matter, I’m going up there.

Meth use really starts to ramp up and I begin questioning myself, am I addicted?

Because I was the only one going up to take care of my mom, her and I decided to get a notary to secretly come to the hospital and we signed a medical POA, giving me the right to make end of life decisions that trump my stepfather’s rights. I knew how she was suffering, even though my family chose to ignore it. I chose to utilize my rights when she was septic in the ICU, unconscious and gasping for air, and they couldn’t even give her pain medication because of her health issues. My stepdad left for the night and I was pissed off that he could leave her in such a state. I called and told him about the POA and said he needs to come back because in 30 minutes I’m having the nurses start comfort care. He came and they discontinued her antibiotics and stuff and replaced it with morphine and Ativan. 

It took her three days to die and each day seemed to last an eternity. I questioned my decision constantly and it felt like I was dying right alongside my best friend. I know that I made the right choice and my mom is proud of me for being strong for her, but my stepdad disowned me shortly afterwards. Kicked me out of my moms house a couple weeks after she died.

By the end of the six months that mom was hospitalized, I was taking considerably more meth than when I started. I was staying up for multiple days and having numerous negative side effects for sure. The looping flashbacks of things I experienced with my mom haunt me to this day and my BPD is worse than ever too.

She died over two years ago now, so it’s been over 2.5 years of almost daily use and it’s made my life unmanageable. Every single aspect of life has been run ragged and I’m ready to do better finally. It served its purpose…I took the best care of my mom when she needed me most and I would do it all over again in a fucking heartbeat if I had to. But the best way for me to honor my momma is to get a handle on my mental health and my addictions, because she was never able to do that for herself when she was alive. She wants that for me, I know nothing else would make her more proud. 

That being said, I’m doing this for me… I deserve so much more than I give myself. I’ll never have a shot of true happiness and healthy love until I sober up and learn new ways.

I’m going to rehab in 2 days and I’m going to unpack all of this shit and leave it there. It’s too heavy for me to carry around everyday. I’m scared af but also optimistic. I have a lot of hurdles to navigate when my 90 days are over but for now, I’m going to live in the moment and heal.

I’m new to this sub and I really need some hope, a light at the end of the tunnel.

I’m a 23 yo male that abused stimulants for almost 2 years. I would take stimulant 4/5 times a week for studying. I was consuming 2-FMA, an RC that is close to vyvanse.

At the end of my last binge for my exams in June, I started getting panic attacks and then, after smoking some weed, my brain just shut off. 

It’s been almost 4 months since the beginning of this and I can’t stand it anymore. I feel completely destroyed.

I can’t sustain conversations because of my brain fog, it’s like I never know what to say and to say something I really need to think a lot, I probably look retarded when talking. My mind is always so blank, it’s killing me. I can’t even talk with my family, girlfriend and closest friends, it’s terrible. I only have songs in my head playing all the time.

I can barely read, it’s hard for me to even read a page. Reading is not as fluid as it was before, and I can’t remember/process the information that I just read. 

I have a lot of incoherent thoughts.

Memory is down to shit, can’t remember stuff I did 5 minutes ago.

I lost all my libido, it’s hard to have sex nowadays.

I go a lot more to the toilet, sometimes it feels like I have some incontinence.

My vision is pretty fucked, have a lot of floaters/visual snow.

When I talk to people I’m always fixing them, it’s like I lost the natural eye movement.

I have coordination problems. 

I’m pretty much all fucked.

Has anyone gone through this? If yes how much time did it take for your brain to heal? The idea of being permanently fucked just destroys me. 

Thank you for reading, which you a sweet recovery ❤️‍🩹",6

I went to rehab for the first time in August. After detox I was only in rehab for five days before I freaked out and left (still working this one out but I think emotional withdrawal probably contributed.) I regretted it within a week of being back home. It was a really good place I think and I could have learned a lot.

Since then I've been sober from hard drugs/the things that sent me to rehab (benzos and a little bit of opiates.) I have not been totally sober since like a week and a half after leaving. For almost two weeks now I've been having a very very very hard time with sobriety. I've been acting impulsively and just generally feeling like I'm struggling and fighting with it whenever I'm awake. I got high on gabapentin the other night and the next night got really drunk for the first time since rehab, definitely out of control drinking.

My therapist asked how strong cravings have been at their worst and I would put them at an 8. I honestly think the only thing that has kept me sober is the fact that I don't have any money, but it'll be so much harder when I do have money soon. 

So because of all this she asked if I want to go back to rehab and said she would vouch for me. This is only my second session with her. I was honestly thinking about whether or not I should go back before she even mentioned it, but it seems extreme if I haven't actually started using again. But there was someone who was there as relapse prevention. So idfk.

I'm so new to all this, I would appreciate any input. Part of me is like ""you couldn't do it the first time, why would you be able to do it a second time"" but I do think it would be different knowing what I know now. Everything just feels way too much right now.",11
2021-11-04 12:36:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/qmomkm/body_image_and_recovery/,Body image and recovery,"Hi Everyone,

My history with addiction and recovery begins with my ex-husband who I was married to for 15 yrs. He began with alcohol and then moved on to abuse ritalin, cocaine and finally crack. I divorced him for the sake of my children and myself as at the time he refused to consider rehab. My journey continued 6 yrs later when my oldest son unfortunately experimented in his first year of college and spiraled down from there. His abuse began with or helped trigger  his mental illness (who knows which came first) and he has lived on the streets off and on for the past five years. I am still fighting for him and hope one day he'll come home and heal. I miss him so very much.

I'm currently in the process of getting my degree in Nutrition Science. I want to use my degree to work specifically with those suffering from mental health issues and substance abuse as I believe nutritional counseling and diet can influence and help an individual's process through recovery. I'm taking a class on Body Image and conducting research on how one's body image can influence their substance abuse and recovery journey. I have a short 9 question survey that I'd like to share with all of you in hopes of getting a better understanding of this subject area. It is anonymous and I would truly appreciate all responses that I receive. I'll post the link below. 

Thank you for your help and also thank you for sharing your stories in this group. I've already learned a lot from so many of you.

Just wanted to share that therapy has been a game changer for me in recovery THIS time around, in addition to meetings and a sponsor. Getting to the root of the issues that trigger me has been cathartic as well as....fun! Learning who I am and how I got to this point has helped me make sense of so much in my life. I'm finally starting to feel comfortable in my own skin as opposed to feeling ""off"" if u know what I mean. I'm also comfortable being a person in recovery instead of constantly resenting the fact that I couldn't ""just stop"" like a ""normal"" person would. It's been a long journey to get to this point(9 years to be exact). I couldn't just surrender or ""let go and let god"" and I would always relapse after a year or two or 3. I keep waiting for ""reality to kick in"" to see if I'll go back to my old irritable, emotionally unpredictable self but....im still fine through all of big bad reality's challenges(I'm unemployed yet job searching like crazy and broke as I type this which would normally be enough for me to be furious for example). I have stress and anger management techniques and a fresh perspective as well as a healthy sense of humor to deal with this crazy life I live. I also meditate and talk about how I feel with my friends(in and out of recovery)and my therapist so if red flags pop up I wont be caught off guard and get high. LOOK OUT WORLD! I'M GETTING MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY(Jennifer Love Hewitt voice)!",19

**Basic Text, p. 105**

Love given, and love received, is the essence  of life itself.  It is the universal common denominator, connecting us  to those around us.  Addiction deprived us of that connection, locking  us within ourselves.

The love we find in the NA program reopens the  world to us.  It unlocks the cage of addiction which once imprisoned  us.  By receiving love from other NA members, we find out—perhaps for  the first time—what love is and what it can do.  We hear fellow members  talk about the sharing of love, and we sense the substance it lends to  their lives.

We begin to suspect that, if giving and  receiving love means so much to others, maybe it can give meaning to our  lives, too.  We sense that we are on the verge of a great discovery,  yet we also sense that we won’t fully understand the meaning of love  unless we give ours away.  We try it, and discover the missing  connection between ourselves and the world.

Today, we realize that what they said was true:  “We keep what we have only by giving it away.”

**Just for today:**  Life is a new frontier for me, and the vehicle I will use to explore it is love.  I will give freely the love I have received.
