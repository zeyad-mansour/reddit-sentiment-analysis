I don’t have experience myself with hard drugs, but my 16 year old son is struggling with addiction. We thought he was just a heavy marijuana user, but had experience with doing Molly’s and Xanax. 

In the last month, he went to voluntary detox once (3 days) and a court ordered detox and relapsed almost immediately after going to school and being around his friends. He left the house and was gone for 3 days before we made the decision kick him out of the house until we goes to treatment (in hopes this would encourage his rock bottom to accelerate). 

A few days later, we noticed no activity on his social media for a few hours and started to get worried. Turns out, he had experienced an overdose. Apparently, he snorted what he thought was meth, but it contained fentanyl as he was brought back with some narco shots. 

He has since agreed to treatment after trying to negotiate his way back home without treatment. 

My questions are this;

1.  Are all opioid overdoses fatal if you don’t receive medical attention, or can your body fight off an overdose on its own?

2.  How successful is treatment?  For something like this, how likely is it to be successful after a month stint in treatment?  For those in recovery, do you have tips for the parents to help there teenager stay sober?

Im not concerned about an opioid addiction, but I am concerned with meth and the heavy marijuana use since he has proven that he is unable to moderate, and it will lead to relapsing on harder drugs.",4,0

Also on: Effexor 150 mg (for Depression and GAD| Antabuse (for alcoholism --> my life saver btw 10/10) | Seroquel 150 mg (for sleep) | Adderall 10 - 20 mg (used off-label as needed for lethargy/malaise),"My recovery story is on my 'Posts' page on my profile. Just reached 60 days of freedom from Alcohol/Xanax addiction. My discussion today is whether the knockout sleep (a.k.a. cured insomnia) is worth the side effects and how Seroquel makes me feel the next day. I take 150 mg of Seroquel every night @ 8 - 9 p.m. before bed along with my vitamins and supplements. I make sure to wash my face and brush my teeth before taking my nighttime medication. Why? Keep reading... Following intake, the \[side\]effects begin. After 30 - 45 minutes of ingestion I feel a sensation in my body and head that is honestly very relaxing and feels good, but soon after this I get so fucking hungry its absolutely ridiculous... For the weed smokers here its like the munchies X10. It's unreal. I used to take it. Discontinued. And am now back on. Its been 1.5 weeks and I have already gained noticeable belly and breast weight (I do not weigh myself). I feel like a sleepy, chubby bunny. I digress. After this occurs its around 1:15 after ingestion and I start getting loopy and if you stay up you will - eat your weight in food, be extremely ""wobbly"" (the feeling of walking and swaying wall to wall --> these effects are extremely potent the first times taking Seroquel), and honestly feel fucked up. Anecdotally explaining how strong Seroquel is, I met a guy in rehab who accidentally stayed up too long and the nurses ended up waking him up in the smoking gazebo at 3:30 a.m. (It's no joke). Following all of these effects I turn the lights out and hit the bed for 12 hours (literally, it's exactly 12 hr. (+-) 30 min. of sleep every night). Upon waking, I don't really experience the morning grogginess many folks seem to experience but Effexor could be the cause. I take Effexor @ the same time as Seroquel. I find I am still hungry in the morning and can eat a fairly large breakfast to begin my day. The daytime, most prominently before 3 p.m. is where my concern with the drug stands... I feel like a fucking idiot for a large part of the morning, explainable by ""the lights are on, but nobody is home"" saying. When I say an idiot I mean I can't recall conversations I had the previous day/evening which is honestly one of my biggest gripes because I am usually very sharp and can recall events and the past very well. I also experience a feeling of malaise in the morning which I like to identify as a case of the ""fuck its"" where nothing really seems enjoyable or important and when met with responsibilities I say ""fuck it"". This feeling is accompanied by a severe feeling of irritability to the point where I can't have meaningful conversation for the beginning of the day. Finally, I have been getting some weird twitches (more like the muscle is jumping/bouncing)  in my right leg along with occasional tremor expressed in my hands and head which could be due to other things as I am a naturally sped up human being on multiple medications. To put all this into a clear topic... I really struggle with Seroquel's seemingly profound effect on: Hunger & Weight Gain | Brain Fog \[a feeling of stupidity\]  | Dulled mood/Malaise | Mild Involuntary Movement of the head, right arm, and right leg | Hand tremors --> I truly love what Seroquel does for me at night as insomnia is no longer in my dictionary when I take it. Having a former Xanax addiction I now struggle with hyperactivity in my brain and Seroquel completely abolishes this feeling. But is it worth the side effects of Antipsychotics (weight gain, irritability, brain fog)? PLEASE discuss in the comments your Experience with taking Seroquel, Scientifically backed evidence/studies pointing towards something related to Seroquel or a symptom mentioned, and any advice you have for me and others!

Found a packed crack pipe after work.,"It wasnt really packed. more like a residue-laden roadside abandonment of a pipe. Broken and ugly.

  I usually consider something like that a freebee. My built-in forgetter forgot I virtually always get unbearable anxiety if I smoke crack or do cocaine without  booze or opiates.

Welp. I smoked the single hit left inside it. Oral numbness, wretched fumes, slight rush.

It was as pointless as my judgement.

Not only did I relapse for nothing but it only gave me anxiety. I HAD TO buy a single shot from the liquor store in order to put the cerebral fire out.

I am so lucky and grateful it was a dinky hit and I only needed a dinky drink.

Im disposing of it and not looking back. Well, ""not forgetting the past nor wishing to close the door on it""

I feel dumb. Im gonna tell my sponsor and restart my clock.

The only emotional upheaval I feel is actually my regret that I cant write like this when Im sober.

I was one of those boozing poets. It flows more easily. O wait, and actually I struck up a very memorable and fun conversation with the folks at the other tables at the restaurant I stopped in at.

Not only that, but I finally put into words what I have been dying to say to a certain significant other of mine.

So, what I guess I want to report tonight is that I fucked up but also, that I remembered one good reason why I drank/used: I was articulate and affable when I was doing so.

Its like relapsing on my hidden talents which I had sworn off because they always lead to self destruction.

Its a hard thing to reconcile.

But dont worry, Im back on the wagon. I know a semi-charmed life of jovial antics and banter and certain death is not worth it.

Many of my favorite musicians discussed their same concerns about getting sober. They turned out alright. At least in my eyes. My favorite authors, however, all died. They sold both their souls and their earthly lives for drink and book deals.

Thanks for listening to me. If you are a new-comer or considering relapse, or relate to what Ive discussed; dont give up. Dont quit 5 minutes before the miracle happens.",18,0

I've been into a mental hospital for addiction recovery twice (2015/2017). Between 2018, and 2020 I had decided to move away to my Grandparents, and I was very grateful for them to have me and let me live at their place. I didn't exactly have a goal at the time, but I was soon working and getting right into a good routine. I managed to save 17k over that time, and in February of 2020 my Pop suddenly passed away.

 He had cancer for over fifteen years, but his death happened very quickly. This obviously affected me in a BIG way as I always found it heaps easier to talk with my Pop compared to my own father. He was a very important person in my life and I miss him. Despite his passing, I continued to work and live with my Nan. I wanted to be there to support her as well, with her partner of over forty years now gone. I was struggling, and had even been struggling emotionally when he was still alive. But this made it worse. 

Come August, and my Grandmother (my mother's mum) passed away. I was conflicted between staying with my Nan and continuing what I was doing, even though I wasn't in a good place. I missed my friends and closer family at home. So, I decided to leave pretty much right after Grandma passed. I moved back down with my parents, and honestly, was both physically and mentally exhausted. I didn't want to look for work, I stopped taking my antidepressants (they made me feel like I couldn't fully feel the emotions of grief), and started to smoke pot again. It had started to snowball, and was now doing coke and acid with friends. I went through pretty much all my savings of 17k on tobacco, pot, and other drugs. I'm down to 3k now. When I was spending it at the time, doing these activities, I knew that it was wrong but I denied it. Pushed it away. 

Then one day, it really hit me hard. I can't help but relate the money I saved with my Pop and his passing. He wanted me to keep working, stay docus, and continue saving my money. I feel like he would be disappointed in me, and I feel so guilty about it. Since ceasing smoking, and going back into the mental health clinic, it has been on my mind a lot and I can't help but ruminate over it. It's mixed with a lot of guilt, grief and shame. I'm finding it hard to go on. And I'm scared, so scared.. that in the future I will relapse again and this would happen all over again. I don't even know what to do anymore, I don't know how to deal with these emotions. And I haven't spoken to anyone really, other than my mother, about how much I really spent because I feel like an absolute idiot.",16,0

My self harm is healing and for the first time I cut, that was sometime ago now and I have two weeks of mental and substance cleanliness. I want to feel better to be glad of myself, but I feel strong and yet weak, these flow of emotions is getting to me, but I'm more positive and focused on what I can do. I apologise if you have read this far, my grammar is bad and my words seem like a letter to no one. Oh well, I have made the steps to try and be better, but will I continue to walk them. I feel confident now, but what happens when the darkness comes back for me, all things are in balance. I hope I can tame the hell inside my head, the darkness approachth, will I remain strong, I better. I really want to give back and help others, I cant if I'm drowning myself constantly. I love you whoever you are out there, you can do this be strong, I'm always willing to talk.

Just the smell of vanilla sends me back to one of my worst benders ever, where i was constantly reapplying this vanilla chapstick. 

I know that logically I should shudder when i think about it but instead i found myself huffing the scent like glue out of a bag. Like just for a moment i was back, and all of today’s responsibilities faded away. Just me hiding out in a bedroom paranoid on a bright sunny day. It was enough to bring tears to my eyes and audibly say “Why do i want to be back?” 

Life is amazing but it’s harder now. Harder than I think i let on. And on top of all the responsibilities, I also have REAL emotions, fears, and things I care about, hobbies I want to nurture. Life is simple when the only goal every single day is to get high/drunk without any cares in the world. 

Today I care about feeling true joy, I care about being a good mom and partner, I care about enjoying my early 20s, I care about finding time to work on art, I care about exercising and being healthy, I care about being outside and seeing people and having friendships, I care about accomplishing goals and taking care of myself and my life. 

It’s hard, but it’s joyful and fulfilling. I wish i didn’t connect using and the simpler times of my life but it was a big part of my coming of age story and I guess it just is what it is. I just wish i didn’t get this pit of nostalgia for that time so often, i wish i could remember it for what it is and be mindful of where i am right now.

Tell me something you wish someone told you. Tell me your stories. I am lost and numb.,"My boyfriend of 3 years is a meth addict. He was tricked into smoking meth when he was 13. I didn’t know about the addiction when we first started out. He hid it from me for about 3 months. I don’t know how I didn’t catch the signs. I thought maybe that’s just how he was? Until a couple of days before my graduation. We were fussing  about small ordinary couple stuff that day. I came home and he was being very quiet in our room, hooked on his video game. He got up went to the closet where he pulled out a light bulb and started lighting it. I was raging. I sure did make a scene... and that is where our battle began.

 In the beginning of me finding out, I used to cry and go into a deep sadness followed by excessive drinking. He was/is always sorry and vows to stop but... it’s an addiction. 

As the years went on he started getting better as I did with his relapsing and no longer turning to alcohol as an outlet. His relapses  went from a couple of weeks to 2 months at the most. About a year or 2 ago I would cry and scream at him for relapsing. I would be mad at him for days. Draining my energy. When he’s sober, we’re on the moon. Best friends. Soulmates. But when he falls back into that hole.. He’s not the man he was the day before and won’t be until the come down is over.

I instantly know when he’s high. I can walk right into the room, take one look and just know.. you can see it in the eyes. You can hear it in his chest, the way his heartbeat is rapid. You can sense it in his tone of voice because he’s trying to keep it cool, you can tell when he’s high because he’s quiet (apparently only around me) because he feels guilty. And I especially know when he’s used when he lies to me and tell me he didn’t smoke. Every time he does it, my heart shatters. He’s a completely different person than the one I fell in love with. The silly, affectionate, talkative, ambitious man. 

I’ve even went as far as threatening to leave. Packing my bags and going to my mothers. Making him prove to me he can be clean for at least 4 months. I gave in though within a month, because as cliche as it sounds.. I’m in love with him. His apologizing and crying and begging me not to leave for long gets to me. He knows what meth is doing to our relationship. He puts what we have on a pedestal when he’s sober, but his urges take over every time. But why risk it all for half a day of a high? 

Within this past year, my crying turned into a disappointed silence. I get disgusted being by him because I see his potential and remind of it. I go to my mothers house while he’s on his 3/4 day no sleeping binges. I hurt in private now, I won’t let him see me cry over his addiction anymore. 

The family he’s close to has the same addiction but 2x harder.. they don’t have intentions of getting clean and they let it be known. No other family knows.

I need some advise. Some words of encouragement, SOMETHING. I’ve tried everything.. I don’t want to lose my best friend over this fucked up drug.

 Our emotions that fuel our thoughts show each of us our road, our unique path to recovery. That is one map we can follow. And it is our privilege to live and heal that route because along the way, we find and nurture our unique selves. Also, we can share our experiences with others and help them heal also, once we are ready to share and once they are ready to work on their own route.

Our abusers trashed our lives with their hatred. The painful wounds that keep playing out in our heads points us in the direction we need to go to heal those wounds and remove their obstacles. Those obstacles nag us because they are not a natural part of us. They aren’t at home; if they were, they’d chill out and settle down.

Our one of a kind soul is trying to kick them out. So, what bothers you the most is where you start. No one has the right to tell you any different.

For me, I had to begin by facing my monstrous family. I had to face the pain they buried deep inside me that haunted me, that drove me to drink, drug, act out, and overeat that still bothered me decades after I severed ties with them in late 1979 or early 1980s. I changed my location physically, but emotionally my path, covered in seething anger and bleeding, went with me everywhere.

Back then, I didn’t know the extent of brain damage and emotional hurdles I faced. Being fragile, I needed the time to heal and gather my thoughts. I think in spring 2011, I began with my then therapist, and having recorded the sessions, I listened to them at home, alone where I could cry, uninterrupted.

In the past, I worried about hurting someone if I allowed myself to feel what I ran from. But I didn’t; when I accepted my pain, I cried and it hurt. But I got through it.

I saw and felt better firsthand. Not a huge amount, but better. The tiny voice inside me suffocating under the cruel lies and bleeding, hurt wounds that caused me to live my life in lies, distorting everything I did, breathed a little stronger.  So, encouraged, I kept going.

Looking back, I see how my path is unique to me, just as your path is unique to you. The events that shape us will vary. Our perspective will be ours alone; it will differ even from our siblings. No one sees our world the same way we do. It is individual to each of us, alone.

But the emotions? The emotions will be the same; shame, humiliation, embarrassment, isolation, and the rest we share.

Our unique selves are suffocating underneath that pain. So, for our beautiful, one of a kind genuine, authentic selves to breathe and thrive, those obstacles need to go.

Because pain that nags us, desperate to go because it is not at home inside us, never gives up on receiving our validation so we can release it. Our soul, our inner self, is doing its job. It is looking out for our well being and urging us in the direction we need to go so we can heal and live our life, the life we were born to live, including the pain we overcome and healed.",9,0

So today is my three month mark and wow it’s a crazy feeling really. It’s probably one of the hardest and strangest things I’ve done but I’m so unbelievably proud of myself. Sometimes I still feel urges and cravings to use or miss the taste have dreams of the feelings wish that I could use picture the images in my head  but I try my best to fight them and over come them sometimes I feel like everyday I just find activities to use so I’m not alone in my head and thinking because that’s when things get bad I suffer from a lot of self hatred and there’s nobody I hate more in life than the person looking back at me in the mirror I’m still trying to get over this feeling I try and make myself and happy and proud of myself  and feel like you do actually have something to be proud of because this is a very big accomplishment and I’m very grateful and proud of myself for doing it if I had any advice to give and addict trying to do recovery do it the way you think works best. I had a recovery coach that would breathe down my neck and say to me all the time your not actually doing it right or your not going to succeed doing it your way and not my way because I don’t go to meetings or she thought it was the most important thing in the world for me to make best friends with another person in recovery I. My town but I just thought not and I looked to myself and said that I can do this and I go get my methadone every morning( I’m tapering right now I know some people will say I’m not sober bc I take methadone but please don’t bc it works for me and helps me keep clean I’m trying) and I talk to my therapist and counselors as needed and I just hang out in the forums there’s more help than I’d ever imagine and just keep myself busy and mind that works for me I also take my meds. I feel like that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without my girlfriends and families support now they weren’t always very understanding and supportive it took a lot of time to gain their trust and everything back but now I wouldn’t do anything to hurt that again. Sometimes I worry that maybe if I did have a car and a license it will be a little harder to stay clean bc I’m stuck here but that’s just going to be another challenge that I will try my best to over come thank you for reading if anyone did and good luck to you and your recovery and I’m always available to talk if anyone needs anything stay safe and stay sober( I can’t believe I actually said that it’s crazy to think about how much we can change in recovery I could never Imagine myself before telling someone to stay sober and it’s actually better for you lol sorry for ranting),83,0

I am coming up on surgery this week to rebuild my pelvic floor after having two kids. I’m one of those lucky people with weak connective tissue and my girl parts need to be structurally fortified. I have had a lot of resentment over this because I did not have my partners take care of me during my pregnancy and my ultra independence took over and I did too much. Little Cathy doesn’t trust people to take care of her, so, fuck that. She’ll do it herself. This time, I can’t. I need help. And little Cathy is scared and worried. My therapist got to her on Tuesday. He told her, “Momma is here. You’re safe now. You can feel your feelings and I’m here to hold and protect you. And it’s ok. We can let go of those things now. We don’t need them for protection anymore. You did your best. We’re safe now. You can rest and take nourishment. It’s ok. I love you. You’re held. Momma’s here. “ The tears flowed. 

I am my own mother that I’ve always been looking for. I knew I had to save myself. I knew no one is coming. But to trust myself - that was the next step. I never knew I was going to be the momma I always needed and was looking for. 

And I was reminded of the passage from Secret Life of Bees. 

“August said, “Listen to me now, Lily. I’m going to tell you something I want you always to remember, all right?” Her face had grown serious, intent. Her eyes did not blink. “All right,” I said, and I felt something electric slide down my spine. “Our Lady is not some magical being out there somewhere, like a fairy godmother. She’s not the statue in the parlor. She’s something inside of you. Do you understand what I’m telling you?” “Our Lady is inside me,” I repeated, not sure I did. “You have to find a mother inside yourself. We all do. Even if we already have a mother, we still have to find this part of ourselves inside.” She held out her hand to me. “Give me your hand.” I lifted my left hand and placed it in hers. She took it and pressed the flat of my palm up against my chest, over my beating heart. “You don’t have to put your hand on Mary’s heart to get strength and consolation and rescue, and all the other things we need to get through life,” she said. “You can place it right here on your own heart. Your own heart.” August stepped closer. She kept the pressure steady against my hand. “All those times your father treated you mean, Our Lady was the voice in you that said, ‘No, I will not bow down to this. I am Lily Melissa Owens, I will not bow down.’ Whether you could hear this voice or not, she was in there saying it.” I took my other hand and placed it on top of hers, and she moved her free hand on top of it, so we had this black-and-white stack of hands resting upon my chest. “When you’re unsure of yourself,” she said, “when you start pulling back into doubt and small living, she’s the one inside saying, ‘Get up from there and live like the glorious girl you are.’ She’s the power inside you, you understand?” Her hands stayed where they were but released their pressure. “And whatever it is that keeps widening your heart, that’s Mary, too, not only the power inside you but the love. And when you get down to it, Lily, that’s the only purpose grand enough for a human life. Not just to love—but to persist in love.” She paused. Bees drummed their sound into the air. August retrieved her hands from the pile on my chest, but I left mine there. “This Mary I’m talking about sits in your heart all day long, saying, ‘Lily, you are my everlasting home. Don’t you ever be afraid. I am enough. We are enough.’”",2,0

i’m not acting quite so extreme lately, but i’m still abusing prescriptions, and i find myself relying on alcohol too many nights of the week. i know i need to stop, but i just can’t will myself to talk to my therapist or my family about this, and i don’t even know where to begin.

I’d spent $1,500 on cocaine from July-November. I shudder to think what good things I could have done with that instead.

My friend we will call S. I met S when I started at college- I sat next to him in a class. He is a strong, buff dude, but soft spoken and kind. As I got to know him, I found out he was in prison for several years on drug related charges. He had been clean for 18 months. He had previously been addicted to meth and heroin, but meth was his drug of choice. He had truly turned his life around. He is a physical trainer, has/had good grades, has his own apartment, has a job working at our college, etc. We went to the gym together occasionally and had been to my house numerous times, over for dinner with my partner and I- came to thanksgiving, has helped us move apartment, etc etc. For as long as I’ve known him, he’s been doing amazing. 

A few months ago he met a girl. He seemed to have a healthy, happy relationship, but it wasn’t called that, he just called it a friends with benefits with someone he really cared about. They both felt the same way as far as I know. 

I moved away in December to another state- we have still been in contact, talking every other day to sometimes once a week, but still remaining close. 

A few weeks ago he started acting a little differently - I asked him if he was struggling. He let me know he was “close to crisis, but won’t get to the point of relapse because he doesn’t want to lose all the good things he has.” I believed him. A few days later he messaged me, as usual, and seemed erratic. I asked him if he was okay. He responded at 4 in the morning, saying “The me that you know is not me right now.” I have spoken to him. He has relapsed. 

I spoke to his sponsor who told me that S will recover, just give him time, he may do an intervention, S is “harmless” And said this has happened before, S will stop using after about a week or two. I asked how I can support him best. He said don’t give him money, and just talk to him, check up on him, I said of course. 

For the last few days, he has been erratic in our chats, obviously on meth, even used in front of me on camera which I expressed I was NOT okay with. But that I am here for him, and I am here to support him. He has cried many times telling me he is so angry at himself for throwing it all away- and will sob for a second, and go back to the manic behavior. He is almost always driving when I speak to him - apparently driving in circles. 
He told me that he hadn’t slept for 5 days and went to the girls house, and lied to her, saying he wasn’t using, but eventually confessed. She said that she doesn’t want to talk to him until he is clean, at least for a few months. It shattered him from what he told me. 

I asked if he wants to stop during one of our conversations while he was driving. He said “I will stop, I know I will, but I need something to stop me. I need something bad enough to happen to inspire me to stop or else it’s just too easy and too fun to keep going. But I will stop. It just won’t be tonight.” 

As far as I know, it’s been about 10 days of him using. Yesterday, however, he video chatted me and had shaved his face, gotten a hair cut, and looked much more like himself than he recently had. He let me know he feels as if he will stop. He is checking out of the hotel and going home. 

My partner also cares a lot about S. I told him what’s happening. My partner said S can come stay with us if it will help get him away from the bad/triggering environment. We can pay for his ticket. I agreed. Especially because we live in sunny California, we have a backyard, a home gym, grill, big-ish home, and have sweet animals, no kids, no roommates - it’s a nice place if I say so myself. We laid down some rules, such as we want him to attend meetings even if online, we want him to work on school, he is welcome to use the gym, but he is not allowed to leave without letting us know where he’s going. He’s welcome to cook (which he enjoys) etc. 

I spoke to S’s sponsor- who said it’s a bad idea. But hasn’t explained much of why. 

I told S that I want him here, but I want to make sure it’s a good idea. I expressed hesitancy of S smoking marijuana while he’s here (my partner and I smoke about once a week but know that when S was clean, he wasn’t smoking, so we feel unsure about it.) S says it’s harmless, not the “drug that matters”, etc, but agreed to the other rules. I said I would prefer if he can be sober when he gets here- he said that’s not possible probably but he will try to sober up quickly once he gets here (he won’t have his drugs anyway, so I said ok). I let him know that I spoke to his sponsor and that I will have to tell him that he is coming. S seemed irritated and said “he (sponsor) is always tangled up in my shit”.  But agreed with our rules, promised to be respectful (S has never been disrespectful by the way). 

I am just hoping someone can tell me whether or not this is ok, and if we are okay to move forward with purchasing S’s ticket (I said I will not give him cash, I will buy directly on a website, which S understood.) Because I have no addiction history, nor does my partner, and S’s sponsor isn’t giving me much info, I just want someone who understands addiction to tell me if this is okay or not. I hope this makes sense. 

Thank you in advance. Sorry that this is so long.",11,0

I didn't realize my thoughts were so negative. I mean, I felt down most of the time, but I didn't realize my thoughts could be different because I knew no different. Having nothing to compare my thoughts to, I tried to live with them because then I didn't know what to do to change them. The only relief I knew was to get drunk or stuff myself. I could not think clearly enough to find the help I needed. I stumbled, confused through my days.

But, bogged down with the hatred my family taught me, ***everything*** was a struggle. Does that make sense? My thoughts were with me everywhere I went and with everything I did. How could I escape them?

So, not having coping skills, I got through my day as best I could, but I could not wait until it was time for me to go home because that meant I could buy beer on the way plus fattening drive through food so I could get home and self-sedate myself away from my struggles.

That also meant my problems did not get resolved, plus I gained weight. None of that helped me. But it is the pattern I glued myself to for the next several years until I got to where I HAD to find actual long lasting relief because I was at the edge of a cliff I thought I would throw myself off of.

After years of trying to get sober only to relapse shortly after again and again, periods of psychotherapy, some AA meetings here and there and one brief out-patient rehab, on November 15, 2007, I called my local AA number I found online and asked for help because I did not know what to do. The next day, November 16, 2007, I began my life in sobriety. I still had kazillions of problems, and maintained my over-eating habits, but I stopped drinking alcohol. I also got back into psychotherapy soon after.

I did not know what lay ahead, but slowly, I got through it, with the help I needed to guide me through the darkest parts.

I give thanks for being on disability, because it allowed me all the time I needed to focus on my recovery and heal slowly so I could get actual strength. If you walk on a broken leg too soon, you aren’t helping yourself, are you? I learned the same goes with healing emotional wounds. Learn to respect your feelings and give them the space and time they need for them to heal their strongest. And you do that by validating them for what and how they truly are.

Once they gain that validation, they settle down, heal, and give you their best when called on. The negative chains break and disappear because they never belonged to you in the first place! That is why they have to go! If they were a genuine part of who you are, they would chill out and settle down. They wouldn’t be nagging you to pay attention to them.

For this reason, what could be more eco-friendly and environmentally safer for our souls than that?",75,0

I am relatively new to Reddit, but I'm finding myself geeking on this social more lately.  Certainly after what's gone on the last couple months.  So I haven't been able to go to a meeting at all this week due to the crappy weather here in the Nashville area.  I can feel it.  Not being around like-minded people working to the same goal.  To stay sober one day at a time.

Today I hit a milestone.  I celebrate 210 days.  7 months of consecutive sobriety.  And old man does it feel good not to feel sick on a regular basis cuz that's what my drinking was doing to me.  I was able to successfully quit, with not a lot of outside help, last summer in the middle of this pandemic.  Which has turned all of our lives upside down to the Nth degree we couldn't even imagine.  You know it's the rigorous honesty inside the AA walls, and the basic premise of the program itself... To stay stay sober.
So I never thought I'd be that guy.  Here I am going to AA meetings every week to help keep my sobriety in check.  And again to be around those wanting the same thing.  

So after my father died on Father's Day in 2014 my drinking became more and more prevalent.  And now I see looking back it is that I was spiritually broken.  Why unhappiness had gotten so deep that I just wanted to drink the days away.  Even with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids it doesn't take away from that pain inside.  Really just a total culmination of all the tribulations that have stacked up.  It's heavy and so up to last Summer my drinking was heavy.  I had become powerless over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable.  That first step.

No I was reading on another person's post about the skepticism of AA.  Personally I've been meeting some good folks and making some new friends.  And in these times it's nice to get out of the house and go get something off your chest, or be able to sit and listen to someone else's story.  I see AA as a tool in my bag to helping me stay sober.  The more frequent conversation with god.  Meditation, prayer.  Do some step work.  Call another alcoholic.  Put out a post about your story.  And yes this has taken me some time to put together.  I'm all about the Buddhism myself.  I even have a shamanism book on my nightstand that I try digging into when I can.  I've even found a good non-denominational church.  Sadly I haven't felt comfortable in months after hearing about infections within the church.
Tools to have in the bag.  That's why I know one of my biggest character defects, self-doubt is a struggle to work on day by day.  I know that's a big one for all of us.  Especially in the middle of this damn pandemic.  

So I'll end with this.  My four pillars that I do my damndest just to live by everyday.
H.onor  in every facet of my life
I.ntegrity  in everything I do & say
G.enerosity  in every way possible
H.umor  every chance you get

God bless my friends.  Let's just stay sober one day at a time no matter the path taken.",5,3

Is this a bad sign?,"Opiates were my primary addiction but I abused all sorts over the years. Drugs completely controlled my life and dictated my every decision. I was in treatment a couple of times and found that to be a mostly positive experience. But ultimately I wasn’t ready to stop.

For whatever reason, in the early days of the pandemic in my country, I was ready. I am now almost 11 months clean. I have never been sober for anywhere near this length of time so I must be doing something right? I have struggles and challenges of course, but picking up genuinely doesn’t feel like an option anymore 

Yet mainstream recovery dogma would basically suggest that I’m doomed to relapse in the near future. I patently don’t believe this to be true but I am confused. I don’t have a sponsor and I haven’t been to a 12 step meeting in nearly 2 years. I attend an aftercare support group one evening a week via zoom.

I am not anti NA/AA per se. When the country opens up again and physical meetings start to take place here I will return to one or two local meetings per week. I am open to the idea of getting a sponsor and giving the steps a try. I will do so in my own time.

But apparently because I haven’t been to any zoom fellowship meetings this is a real threat to my recovery? In my support group I saw a member getting heavily criticized for only going to one meeting last week. It seems kind of ridiculous.

I’m reluctant to label the 12 steps as a cult. Clearly it has worked for a lot of people and it may yet help me. But the idea that we need to attend meetings our entire lives or we’ll relapse/be desperately unhappy? It seems so narrow minded and black and white.

Surely it is possible to live a fulfilling and contented life in recovery without the 12 steps? I’m not rejecting NA I’m just expressing doubt and asking questions. I don’t feel comfortable doing so in my support group as the mantra there is very rigid and hostile towards anyone who strays from the conventional doctrine",58,1

just a post to get some advice of my good ol fellow junkies. so to start off ive been using benzos and opiated for 5years straight. ( for the information, i just turned 18 so im pretty young )I went to a detox in last year, was there for 10weeks. My tolerance was that high that it took 8 weeks to get off benzos and opiates. After going trough that missery i said to myself: Now i am really done with it! ( yeah sure...) so full of confidience, feeling better, sitting on my pink cloud thinking i can do everything now im clean. I come up with the amazing idea that while im still in a clinic when i turn 18 i can still use that last time to close this chapter. 

Long story short got a urine screening they caught me with almost everything possible and sent me away to another rehab in africa for 2months. I am homeless, broke and broken at this point, already failed in my eyes with the relapse and this is my last change, last one to fix the trust and pain with my loved ones. Here i really try my best, follow the program, try to change my people places things and thinking patterns etc.
I attend to meeting, do my stepwork and i try to talk to people with a long clean time to see what life is like.

Okayyy, Here is the part i want advice for:

As im sitting here i am in a safehouse with screenings every week. I am on anti depressants and i start feeling better time by time. Problem is lack of motivation. im already sick and tired of life and it didnt even start yet. So i am here sober for 4months now trying to find a life worth living, and if i trust the people around me life will get better, but for me it doesnt the only thing that changed is that now i can feel things again ive always pushes away.

I gave up last night and ordered benzos, opiates and smoked some cannabis yesterday night.

i can start counting again with clean time but i feel just like giving up. Because why working for a life that i am not going to like. Please help me i am desperate and dont know what i can do.

Should I just accept what i did and use again(what i want) and try to quit when i am older or just try again and again untill i see things slightly changing and hoping that that will bring external factors in my life that will motivate me?


I really hope someone can help me or just lift me up or give advice

My bf is an addict. This is the first time I date an addict. I obviously didn’t know that going into the relationship, it was after I caught feelings and he said “I love you”. He then later told me he had problems. He didn’t say what kind of problems, I just assumed it was like problems with the law. Nope, I was wrong. He later told me it was drugs and he was clean for a few months. He relapsed New Years Eve and on Jan 20th. Coming to find out, it wasn’t a relapse. Because how can you relapse when you actually never did stop doing drugs? He checked himself into rehab the following day (Jan 21st). He got kicked out this month, but went to another rehab. 

He says that this time he’s doing it for himself and because he knows he can’t put his body through it anymore. 

While in rehab, he has still lied about small things. He said he was randomly drug tested. Not true. I spoke with a nurse and they said they’ve never drug tested him aside from the initial drug test. I understand addicts are used to lying. But why lie about small things like that. Unless he’s using while in there, right? The nurse asked me if I was concerned about him still being on something while being in there, I told him yes. So maybe they’ll do a test. Idk. 

I need advice. Asides from leaving. Like I said, I’m new at this. When he gets out, I will see what happens. I know I must put myself first, think of me. Because after all, I am not responsible for his actions nor am I responsible for what happens to him. I just hope I’m this strong if the time ever did come where I have to choose.",3,0

But if I was to tell my mom she would be like ""how could you?"" ""When are you ever going to learn."" Or worse ""I disown you.""

I just don't understand. I know parents have tough love for their children, but hell if you have an adult child suffering treat them like one. Not like a person who brought shame unpon the family. We need you to love us. Not tell us how disappointed you are. 

If some random person could reach out and say positive things for us instead of beating us down why can't our own family do the same? I bet you there are people who refused to go to treatment because they are scared of what their own family will say to them.

I've personally experienced the benefits of ""turning my will"" over to a higher power, particularly the way that centering my motives on something outside of myself allows me to be less self-centered and ultimately more comfortable in my own skin. The rest of the program, particularly thorough inventory/amends and helping others, has obvious benefits.


I just can't handle the religion. I tried the first time and did some pretty impressive mental gymnastics to make clearly theistic concepts reasonable while being honest with myself - which means admitting I don't believe in a personal God.


Some of this is exacerbated by people who use 12 step programs to push their personal religious perspective by moving the goal posts until ""higher power of your understanding"" essentially means ""your choice of Christian doctrine"" and I think this has always been intended between the lines considering the history of mainstream 12 step programs. Recently I started working with a sponsor who, after several days of going through the book and reaching the appropriate step, did exactly this and then tried to claim I just didn't want recovery enough if I didn't want to accept a Christian higher power despite this being *directly contrary* to the literature of the 12 step program in question. I have heard this attitude from too many people in the program now and, especially in my local groups, don't want to keep spinning my wheels until I just end up resenting the program without finishing the work like last time.



I don't want to start a debate about religion or a session of shaming people who co-opt 12 step programs to press their own religious views. All of this post so far has been for context.


I have two (and a half) questions:


1)Does anyone here have experience making a mainstream 12 step program like AA work with a truly non-theistic higher power? If you have, how have you handled or avoided having your recovery hijacked by religious prosthelytizing without building resentments or disconnecting from the community?


2)Does anyone here have experience working a program of recovery that checks all of the boxes of a mainstream 12 step program without involving religion?",7,0

I recently left a detox program, that I found to be awfully lonely, but I guess the point of detox was to allow myself a place to get a clean start, not talk about all of the under lying issues I've buried over the years. 

The last few days have left me feeling optimistic as a mofo, in happy I'm living in the present and not constantly high.

I overslept and missed my medication time by 13 minutes. So when I woke up, I ate some cereal as usual and took my 600mg of gabapentin and 300mg of Prazosin and took the dogs out for potty. Mind it's 24f in Portland, OR so as I'm standing in the freezing ass cold I noticed I was getting agitated with my dog for not taking a shit, we were out there for 20 minutes and he just wanted to explore.  Nothing wrong with that right?

Well something inside me started to slip and I was getting more and more agitated so after another 10 minutes we went back inside. I then proceeded to give my dog his meds (hip/joint problems and he happens to be on gabapentin ad well, go figure).

As if I'm trying to give him his meds I could no longer keep myself calm. I was getting extremely frustrated with him because he didn't want to take the meds. At this moment I realized I was starting to loose control over my emotions. 

I gave up trying to give him meds and went up stairs to take a hot shower in the fetal position. After letting hot water run over me for 20 minutes I was starting to go to a dark place in my head. 

So I picked up my phone and decided to write to all of you lovely people. After writing all of this out I'm feeling a lot better. 

I know everyday won't be filled with optimism but holy f**** was this morning hard.

I have a good feeling about my future.

Mid-month, I broke a yearlong Ritalin-snorting habit.

On December 29, I did some math and realized how much I spent monthly on alcohol and cigarettes. I decided to quit buying. I quit alcohol that day (no withdrawal symptoms, yay). Some ecigarettes my friend had given me were laying around, so I ""smoked"" those (because no money spent), finished them Jan 8, and then quit nicotine, too.

I stayed clean for almost a month.

And then February hit. 

February 2 was the anniversary of a sexual assault. I started crying shortly after midnight.

At 1am, an hour into the anniversary of that trauma, a strange man rang my doorbell (my fifth floor doorbell, not the buzzer to open the front door) and said that his friend had sent him because I am ""very nice."" A few minutes after I turned him away, he came back and offered me money for sex. (As an American, I now want a gun to protect myself in my own home.)

On February 4, I got a letter in the mail telling me that I lost the legal case I brought against the assailant.

On February 6, a condom broke. I asked the guy the last time he got tested. ""Oh, you mean a check-up? Oh, an HIV test?""

On February 7, a guy lied to me to get himself a birthday threesome.

I made it through the first four triggers of the week. But on the 7th, I bought cigarettes and alcohol.

Now it's HARD to quit again.

I finished the cigarettes and think I'm okay there.

But the alcohol...

I'm buzzing with nerves and anxiety and need to calm down. (I'm bipolar and went off meds with the Ritalin addiction. Can't take meds at bedtime if you never go to bed, I guess. I'm finishing up the month's supply I got in June...)

Cigarettes were a habit. Alcohol is self-medicating. It's a coping device.

I really don't think I can stay dry.",5,0

So after 7month most of the days are a struggle. I just cant enjoy anything. I just want to sleep my whole day. My brain is still so slow. I never thought is gonna be like this. I never had problems with my mental health or anything before or while I was on it. I just can’t see the end of this tunnel. Will this shit going to be better? I will always be an unhappy man? I will always be anxious and tired? Will my libido come back or my emotions? Can I feel love again?

I know that if I go back into this life, Id be able to be a functioning addict and keep it under wraps. I know as well that that wont last. 

It doesnt help that the city where I live, people are liberal about drug use. 

Im pretty scared because theres no one asides myself who can stop me from saying “fuck it, im gonna go buy a bag and light up”. I dont know how to stop myself from thinking of just caving in.

Female from Seattle going to treatment in California. This is my second time in treatment. I have 75 days clean. 

I made the decision when I first got down here that I was going to move to Orange County, there are too many connections for me in seattle and I honestly don’t think I could stay clean there. But I was renting an apartment in Seattle (my half of rent was $1000) and the lease isn’t up until July. I’ve been out of work and in treatment since late September and I was on state leave for the maximum time which is 12 weeks. I paid rent for 3 months while I was not actively living there. A while ago I called my landlord to explain the situation and tried to get him to shorten my lease, but he wouldnt, which is understandable from his viewpoint. But my mom co-signed for me, so she is the one ultimately responsible for the rent. Since I decided to move down here, my best friend and roommate has since gotten her own apartment so she cannot contribute to the rent, so almost $2000 of it is falling on my mom every month. I have no income anymore and only have a couple hundred dollars, which I will need when I transition to sober living. The apartment is up for rent on Zillow but renting rates in Seattle are super low due to covid and nobody has rented it. Basically my mom has to pay almost $2k because of me and my addiction. It’s so shitty and I feel like a horrible daughter, especially because there’s not really anything I can do. I brought up me coming back home to work and pay the rent, and my parents were not supportive of that idea. They really want me to stay in California, but at the same time they are super disappointed about having to pay the rent. I just feel like a complete piece of shit about this whole thing.",11,1

I don’t have a lot of experience talking about addiction or talking to addicts, but I have a friend who was an addict and is a few years sober. We met semi-recently, but we hit it off right away and by now I think of him as my brother. I’ve known for a while that he’s an addict and sober, and it feels like he’s aware that I support him whatever happens. Every now and again we’ll both make jokes about it, so it feels like we’re in a good place.

A while ago, though, we were in separate states and he texted me saying that he was feeling urges to use again. In that moment I felt so ill-equipped to help and support him through what, for all I knew, could turn bad quickly. My dad is an alcoholic, but he had a very clean-cut recovery and hasn’t expressed any desire to drink since--at least not to me. I can’t remember what I said to my friend; my first instinct was to be with him, but since we couldn’t do that I think I asked him to find people that he trusted to either talk him through it and/or distract him since I couldn’t. I can’t remember exactly. Bottom line is that I felt so aware of how much trust he was putting in me, how much I wanted to honor that, and how conscientious I needed to be with my words and what I said, but I didn’t have any personal experience to talk to him about or relate to him with. 

He let me know that he didn’t actually want to use again, but he was having urges throughout the day and felt like he needed to tell someone. We haven’t talked since about having urges or memories and I’ve been averse to bring it up in case it triggers a response in him. I don’t know if he just needed someone to listen to what he was going through or if there was something I absolutely should have said in that moment so make things better. If the time comes again, though, I want to be prepared and ready to help him and let him know how much I care and want him to succeed. What kinds of things should I say to him in this moment? How do I show him that I love and support him?

Furthermore, I want to know when and how to start a conversation and keep an open dialogue with him about his recovery beyond the occasional joke or passing comment. Should I ever initiate the topic, or should I always wait for him to decide if he’s comfortable enough to initiate? What kinds of questions can I ask him to get to know his addiction? Which ones should I avoid?

I’ve tried researching how to help and talk to him about it, but I could only find advice for those helping addicts currently in the midst of addiction or relapse, not for those helping and talking to sober addicts experiencing the ups and downs of sobriety. Any advice or information would be really appreciated, and I apologize if anything I said was wrong.",4,0

I'm 21 and have had a serious drug problem with mainly heroin, crack, and cocaine for almost 5 years, and it has completely ruined my life. I had already had a bad history of mental health, and my drug problems tipped things over the edge to the point where I just didn't know what to do anymore. I dropped out of school, was barely leaving the house for weeks, sometimes months at a time, became the most depressed I had been in my life, and still to this point haven't seen any of my friends at all in more than 3 years. It's been the hardest thing I've ever gone through.

I know that COVID-19 has affected people in lots of different and awful ways, but for me, lockdown allowed me to finally focus on myself for a prolonged amount of time and start to make progress. After already having stopped using all other drugs last year, I started taking methadone and - after an incredibly hard withdrawal period - I have now been heroin-free for 4 months exactly today.

I have kept all of this completely secret from everyone in my life except my partner who has similar problems and my therapist. This has been incredibly hard and isolating for me. I would have never managed to do this without the support of my amazing and supportive boyfriend, but also without having this time over lockdown to really focus on my mental health and make myself the priority for once. The only hard thing is that it's really sad to not have anyone I can share my achievement with, and so it feels really nice to be able to write this openly on Reddit and not keep it a secret.",41,3

   Hello everyone 👋, let me start everyone off by telling you my name which is Jarred. I am 22 years old and I am an father to an beautiful little girl named Delilah! (PRESENT DAY) The mother and I who is 19 years old just recently came to an agreement for me to have her for 3 hours once an week instead of coming to her house one a week and only getting to spend 1 hour with my daughter. I have an girlfriend named Harley who is amazing and I work for door-dash. I graduated high school with an average 3.2 GPA (nothing crazy) I went to an career HS for computer networking. 

   I have recently took the time and effort to reach out to the court system and family services in order to start paying child support for my daughter, get on her birth certificate, get visitation paperwork/info sent to me. I have done nothing but be kind to the mother and all she does is beat up on me I feel all because I slipped up and cheated with an girl all wasted/Xanax’d out 2-3 years ago. I BEAT MYSELF UP FOR 2 FUCKING YEARS. She doesn’t want my money to help out with our daughter nor does she want my support, she has given me the silent treatment for months and persists to do so. Any money I give her she puts it into an college savings account for our daughter 🤷‍♂️. (THE PAST) The relationship only lasted 3 months and after we broke up, somehow she shows up on my door-step while my parents are out vacationing across the world in Cambodia. 

   Then, mentions the fact she’s pregnant. It was out of an movie, I swear to god. I don’t believe in abortions as I am an christian and strongly feel against it. I swallowed my pride and leveled with her. I cried like an baby for weeks trying to understand why this world hated me. I was raised to believe an mother and father are supposed to be in their lives together no matter what as my parents have been together 30+ YEARS. I got heavy into drinking alcohol and occasionally experimented with other substances once in a blue moon if I felt up to it. NEVER DAILY. I eventually cut all my friends off who used me for rides for their addiction to substances. I wasn’t about their lifestyle.

   I drank though... a ton. I would drink anywhere from 10-12 beers and or an pint of liquor daily for an constant 4 weeks in order to numb the pain I felt. I got so bad I ended up trying to go cold turkey without knowing the effects of withdrawal from alcohol. I Had an delusional thought while looking in the mirror of myself, slitting my own throat with an razor blade that was sitting by this off white porcelain sink in my buddies basement bathroom. I was staying with at the time because I was going through withdrawals and didn’t want my parents to know. It was an real horror scene. Scared me half to death. I have a bit of an history with depression, but I got so delusional I started contacting everyone in my family telling them crazy things about my parents marriage and some stuff about myself. (ALL DELUSIONAL LIES) My dad and mom zoomed over and picked me up immediately. They had an family chat with me and decided mental health hospital/rehab was best (they weren’t wrong). I acted like an loon to everyone. 

   They gave some wacky meds to me there. They gave me some medication called “HALOPERIDOL” an anti-psychotic medication for schizophrenic patients. I ended up having an allergic reaction and collapsed, almost dying from an lack of oxygen. My blood felt like it was on fire and I was jumping around trying to take my clothes off 😣 they ended slapping me with an allergic reaction serum in an fat gauged needle 6 minutes later... Trust me, I rated my stay 1 star believe me. The food got an 5 star cause the cafeteria ladies loved me and gave me extras of meat for protein every time I went in line for working out 🤣
   Now this is my first mental clinic/rehab go around. I completed 15 days at the mental health clinic and 30 days at rehab.  I get out and go to an three-quarter house. I Lived there for 2 months. Hated it. My Roommates didn’t know how to clean or pickup after themselves. I Went home and started drinking again... 3 months home now I try going sober again. succeeded for 10 days. Then after that i went back to drinking again.... 🤔😔🤬 and it was almost time for my daughter to be born. I wanted to be there so bad but the mother hated my guts “so I thought” and I was so depressed every day leading up, I really wanted to end my life. 

   I decided 2 weeks before the due date my dumb dumb selfish self wanted to go into rehab again. I Did it for 15 days. Then Came out to go see my daughter after she was born. I felt good for 30ish days sober. 
I eventually Went back to drinking because of social influence and parties. I was an highly functional alcoholic I would like to say as I could hold myself off from the time I wake up until 8-9 pm before I had an drink. I had an legal issue where I stole some alcohol from an super Rich neighborhood Walmart like an bludgeoning moronic imbecile and they posted my photo on the sheriffs Facebook page in order to get an name. All in all I learned my lesson and the sherif was nice enough to cut me an break after going in to the station pleading my case of alcoholism..... i was publicly shamed by everyone and my daughters mother exclusively. She would never let go the fact of me drinking and driving when we were together or me stealing alcohol at Walmart. 

   1-2 years later of me slowly ditching all negative influence in my life in order to be an role model and father in my daughter life.  I decided 16 days ago I want to be alcohol free. I had my ups and downs with drinking. Overall it’s not my friend and will likely never be 👎. NOW THIS IS THE POINT WHERE IT GETS BETTER... 😁 I told myself enough is enough! I want to be clean from this shit for 90 days, because I remembered an nice guy whom I crossed paths with who “SMALL F—KNG WORLD” worked in the same exact factory my brother is an nurse for. MY BROTHER ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE WHO PEE TESTED THE DUDE AND GAVE HIM THE REFERRAL TO HR.  😓😱😬 

   Luckily, Andrew was nice enough to share the same values as I do 😧 and treated me like anyone else he has ever met. 🙏 ANDREW IF YOU FIND THIS. THANK YOU MAN!!!!I REALLY HOPE YOUR DOING WELL! 🤜Any who, While in the 1/3 house I was staying at. Me and Andrew went out for lunch and he paid for it. Amazingly an super genuine nice guy. He told me 3 simple rules in order to live an new healthy lifestyle. He said 1.) create healthy habits in order to succeed. Make your bed daily,Pray to god (if your religious), Write 10 things your grateful for, Meditate, clean Etc. DO THIS for 30 days and they will become habitual to the point you don’t even notice 🙌 Now... 2.) continue this for 60 days and it will be an automatic response engrained into your brain! This is all scientific. Andrew was pretty smart. Step 3.) do this for 90 days and you will be living an new lifestyle. Bless this man. 

   (PRESENT TIME) Instead of just going alcohol free without any kind of weening I decided to ween myself off this time. Drinking 5 beers one day, Starting with day #1 going down to 1 beer, leading up to January 16th my official Quitting date. As soon I stopped drinking my brainwaves went haywire and I went from an depressed state to an alert state within two days! WOW I immediately took to watching self improvement videos and took notes! SEVEN DAYS IN now it’s amazing how much I forgot the real world. I make my bed in the mornings and keep everything organized and neat daily. I communicate and listen more effectively than EVER before! My daughters mom is allowing us 3 hours on Sundays to spend time with her in order to warm her up to my family, my girlfriend and I before court gets involved.

   I had my three hour long visit at my house for the first time with my 17 month old daughter and my parents. I couldn’t be happier to hear her call me daddy, give me hugs and kisses. She was at my hip the whole time! On the way to the gym today I started balling my eyes out uncontrollably while in the car thinking to myself (“how proud she would be of me for turning my life around for her and myself; way in the future”) and at one point I had to pull over, because I couldn’t see the road. 
   My daughters mom has begun to treat me better and trust me more since I have been putting our daughters best interests in my heart the past 3-4 months. I started losing weight, feeling better and I’m now setting goals almost everyday for myself. I’m saving money to move out with my girlfriend next month. Everything is improving emotionally/mentally for me and my relationships with God, family and friends has been restored. I don’t feel alone anymore. I went from somebody who I was disgusted with to somebody I say hello to every morning in the mirror! 

   OFFICIALLY 16 days sober now from alcohol! HOORAY. In order to remain the way I am I have to complete the 90 days in order to form an new lifestyle. This is super important as it is backed by science and science seems to prevail in some areas. I’m Not gonna get on the topic of religion with this post. I will and am not going to have an drink for 90 days as it has slowed down my progress in life. When I finish the 90 days, I am going to sit down and write an pros and cons list labeling the paper alcohol and fit as much as I can on TO it. I will finally Find an quiet place, sit silently meditating and reading my pros and cons list for an little long-while and decide whether I want to drink again! 

   Thank you to anyone who took their time to read all of this. ANY AND ALL ADVICE/COMMENTS/SUPPORT WELCOME. I REALLY HOPED THIS HELPED SOMEONE. I have been wanting to post this for a minute now!!! my hearts starting to feel at ease again. I missed those days. ( FYI I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED I USE MARIJUANA TO DEAL WITH ANXIETY, IT HELPS THE ALCOHOL CRAVINGS AS WELL)—-legal state of course. I just don’t know if alcohol is for me. As I have an fairly addictive personality handed down from the gene pool. Change is never easy, it’s slow and exhausting. Stick with it and results will come.",39,0

Not sure if it’s because I’ve decreased my Suboxone or what but it just seems to be getting worse and worse. Two friends dying of overdoses last year and my own near escape from death not long after have led to this constant fixation on mortality and existence, the universe, all of time and history and my place in it. It’s a lot to take in and frankly, it scares the crap outta me. Combine that with getting older and looking back, trying to shake the feeling like my best years are behind me and I didn’t even come close to making the most of them. So it’s 1:30 in the morning and here I am, unable to sleep, wondering what I can do to get better and learn how to breathe again. Probably a long shot, but maybe someone reading this can relate? Maybe someone has been thru this feeling and knows the way thru to the other side. I’ve spent so many years seeking comfort in bottles and baggies and I know there are no answers there; I have walked down all those roads and they are dead ends, each and every one of them.

It would be helpful to believe that there’s more than just this life and in my entire time on this earth, there is only one thing that has ever made me think that maybe there could be. It was at the end of October last year when I found myself at the doorstep of death with no other options. At the last minute, on one of my last days, I woke up to a message from a friend that gave me a way to live. I can’t explain it. One night I went to bed, unable to do anything to save my life. The next morning, I read that message and I was able to turn and walk back the other direction. My friend had had a dream that moved her to send me that message. Since that day I have tried so hard to explain how I suddenly a was able to do what I couldn’t before and there is no early explanation I can find. Maybe there’s more than just this life. Maybe there is more than I can ever understand. Who can say? In any case, I’m tired. Maybe I’ll get a few hours of sleep and won’t make an ass of myself falling asleep or being slow tomorrow at work at 7 am.

Goodnight all.",7,0
110,2021-02-01 01:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/l9wbpg/6_months_babeyyyyy/,6 months babeyyyyy😼,"tldr: I am trying to recognize my own improvement instead of relying on praise from others, I am so much happier. 

A little over six months clean and I am FINALLY starting to realize that I’ve grown as a person. I always found things to complain about, and despite all of my improvement, I just couldn’t let myself have pride in my progress. I’m not sure why. 
I have become so painfully self aware, which is both good and bad. I think I am just trying to make up for all of the horrible shit I did in active addiction by becoming perfectly unproblematic and selfless as quickly as possible. That isn’t realistic and I am working on not being so ruthless and critical towards myself. 
However, I am actually allowing myself to recognize how much more empathetic and kind I am now compared to 6 months ago. I never want to hurt anyone again, and I want to be as kind and understanding as possible, and I think simply wanting and striving for that is huge, even if I fuck up sometimes. 
I am slowing growing back into my personality and I think I’m developing a more solid feeling of identity.. if that makes sense. I never knew who I was. My entire personality was based around drugs and reflecting whoever I was with. 
I am okay with being alone more often now, and instead of having several horrible ‘friends’, I have one amazing friend and my grandmother. I could not have gotten clean without  them. I am so so thankful that they forgave me for the awful shit I did while in active addiction, although I have a hard time forgiving myself. 
I am able to recognize when my addict brain is trying to worm its way back into control, and have been doing so much better at telling it to shut the fuck up.
I cry less, I laugh more, I sing for enjoyment instead of singing to fill the empty space, I have TWO jobs, and I have my emotions back. I am allowing myself to acknowledge my own improvement instead of relying on others.",24,0
