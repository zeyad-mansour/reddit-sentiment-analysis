I was lying in emergency IV hooked to me. My girlfriend was looking after all the formalities of admission. She asked me to call my parents when I refused she called herself. Explained them the situation. My parents came.  half unconscious I saw my girlfriend explaining my parents what happened. They rudely replied ‘we know’ my parents blamed her for my condition saying that why did she let me drink even after knowing my condition. A tear rolled down my eye seeing that. It was not her fault. I lied to her. She was not aware about the severity. And there she was standing there taking blame. She left and my parents approached me. 

The first question my mother asked me ‘Have you no shame’ I was lying there listening. But I did not respond & closed my eyes so they think I am not completely conscious. I saw my father’s face. He was not looking at me. His eyes were filled with anger. He did not want to face me. I felt so ashamed. I let down my father. He lost all respect for me. I could feel that he was just there to perform his duty as a father. My mother crying. My father disappointed. What the f**k did I do again ? How the f**k did I end up here again ? The pain was of same intensity but this time my mind was numb to pain. Like it already knew this was going to happen. I was moved to the hospital bed. My mother on the side sofa. My father came in the room. I was awake now & was staring out the window. I did not want to face anyone. 

My mother was on sofa praying when my father walked in. He looked at my mother and said I am going back to work & I have admitted him. My mother asked him to stay. I will always remember what he said. Why should I stay ? Why because of his addiction his poor choices I have to suffer my work has to suffer. He cannot take care of himself. How the f**k can we ? He did this to himself. All on his own his own. His own choices. He will never change. And we cannot do anything about it. We can be there for him when he is at home. We cannot be there for him holding his hand every single second of his life to see that he does not drink. He does not slip. He does not die. Its upto him. He drank. We hospitalised him. He drank again. We hospitalized him again. Thats all I can do. Its upto him. What he wants to do. I am going. He left. 

I was still staring out the window. My body was in so much pain. But my mind was numb. I wanted to scream that its paining ! But I did not. I could not. I did it to myself. Again ! The treatment was the same. I was put on IV. At nights I used to cry silently so no one hears. When my mother was asleep (she was stuck again taking care of me) I used to take my IV stand and walk out to the nurse. And ask for pain killers. Even to move I had to go through excruciating pain. I dont know how I did that. Maybe because I was experiencing so much guilt & fear. I did not want anyone to find out this time. Because me winding up in the hospital again was all my doing. No one asked me to drink. No one forced me to drink. Everyone was 200% supportive. 

But here I was, lying in hospital again. So whose fault was that. It was mine ! I was the one who was not able to control. I was the one who slipped. I was one who did not even have the spine to stop drinking knowing it was killing me. Not slowly but very very fast. I just kept thinking. 

I am not a coward. I am not dependent on alcohol. My life of is not dependent on alcohol. My happiness is not dependent on alcohol. My choices are not dependent on alcohol. The problems which I might be going through my life will not be solved by drinking. I did not want to forget my problems. I wanted to solve them. Face them. 

I think that might be the reason I started drinking. When I was young I always saw liquor as ‘liquid courage’ My father was a very unexpressive person. As I told you I can count the number of times we actually hugged. He in an honest man. He was always quiet with me. I was provided with everything I wanted. He never refused. He was there for me always. But I never got a fatherly feeling from him. But 2 drinks down my father was a changed man. He was smiling. He was talkative. He used to become so generous after getting drunk. He loved spending time with me when he drank. We talked about everything. But the next morning. Silence hits the room again. So I saw what alcohol did to his personality. And I liked it. Being a dumb kid I wished for him to be drunk all the time. 

Back to the story. I realised that thinking that alcohol was the solution to my problems. To be a person everyone desires and wants to be around. Laying in the hospital bed I though of how I was 4 years before & how I am now. The comparison was an eye opener. Let me tell you what all my precious alcohol gave me. It gave me a shitty physique. In those 4 years My weight fluctuated between 75-98 kgs. It gave me a weaker eyesight. I started wearing specs. And my lens power increased every year. It gave me a shitty work life. After 2 years I was still right there where I started. Zero ! I had nothing to show for it. I almost lost my gf as I grew distant. Because I was more in love with alcohol. It left me with a crippled body & mind. 

I recovered fast this time. I was out of the hospital in 6 days. I had a new perspective. My mind was completely enlightened now. I knew that alcohol is no longer an option. I was a changed man. A man who no longer drinks. I accepted that fact and used to say it people. That I do not drink anymore. I used to teach people how alcohol is so bad for you. How its gonna ruin your life. And I am alcohol free now. It feels so good. I feel so fresh now. Life was very pleasant. I even joined a gym. It was going extremely well. I started homeopathy medicine for healing my pancreas. I started eating light & healthy. I started sleeping very well. I no longer felt the need to drink.

Month out of the hospital. One night I was watching a movie in my bed. If anyone recalls ‘Euro Trip’ I was halfway through the movie. I was at the scene where four of them go to a nightclub in Bratislava and one of the guys gets so drunk that he kisses his sister. Damn that was funny. But the thought that came in my head was damn ! Wish I could get drunk and have fun again ! I slapped my self for thinking that and went to sleep. Next morning I woke up. Went to work. On my way back from home. I was listening music. My mind was blank. I was driving by a liquor shop.  A thing I used to do whenever I passed by a liquor shop was to press my abdomen to check for pun. Seeing it I  pressed my abdomen to check whether there was pain. I did not feel anything. But this time. I pressed again & harder. It was fine. I took a U turn parked my car right outside the liquor shop. Got out. Approached the shop.

Hey Can I get a 250ml bottle of whisky ?!

Request for more questions to be answered on my Addiction-Recovery-Spirituality youtube channel set to launch on January 2020,"Thank you for the questions 3 weeks ago. I have shot and edited the videos and they will be posted on January 1st. I have banked 10 episodes to launch that day. More about the channel:

My clean date is April 12, 2010. On my channel, I answer questions in my videos about addiction recovery and spirituality. I take a broad and open-minded approach to questions on this topic. It doesn't matter where you are on the spectrum of belief and secular/atheist/agnostic inquiries are great too. 

I've worked as a chaplain and addictions counselor in treatment centers. I have worked in harm reduction settings and abstinence-based treatment settings. I hold a strong belief that the recovery methodology that works for an individual is one that suits them best. My youtube channel does not favor any single form of treatment. I am an LGBTQIA+ affirming clergy person. My channel is merely a place for folks in recovery or considering entering recovery to listen to brief insights.

Any questions, if I haven't covered them, will be answered. If you ask a question now it won't be posted until mid to late January on the Youtube channel. Please provide consent to use your Reddit username in the video. If you do not use provide consent you will be referred to as an anonymous user.

Won’t seek help.","My grandma is 71 and lives in our basement. I’ve always known she’s been a closet drinker, but these days it’s seemed to get much much worse. Today,
I found about 30 empty Two Sixes of Red Label vodka in her closet and cabinet drawers. On top of her drawer, she has anti-depressants that has a big red label that says “DONT MIX WITH ALCOHOL” -clearly she is doing just that. She mixes the vodka with carbonated soda, which our recycling is also completely full of.

We have tried getting her help, but she doesn’t listen at all. These days, she is barely a shell of her former self. She watches Fox News all day and walks around the house like a zombie. She doesn’t have dementia, but she is starting to forget lots of stuff. A big example that is very annoying is she will never check with my mom when she goes to the grocery store (going to the grocery store is one of the few activities my grandma still does, alongside going to church once a week), and she always buys things that we already have at home without checking with my mom. This results in a tremendous waste of food and money because the stuff she buys just ends up going bad. This happens every single week.

Other bad things include her never cleaning her room, constantly ordering cosmetics off of Amazon, doesn’t go outside or do any exercise, barely socializes with anyone, and she has very very bad tremors. If she isn’t drinking, her hands shake wildly.

Last year around this time, she had a very bad accident when she was drunk. She fell down some stairs and broke her wrist which resulted in one of her bones sticking out of her wrist. This seemed to really scare her and we used this opportunity to convince her that she has a drinking problem and that she should seek help. She appeared to have stopped drinking for about 2 weeks, but then was shortly back on it.

It’s very bad. But we don’t even know what to do. She won’t even admit she has a problem. It sucks because she is pretty much just rotting away in our basement and she won’t do anything about it. Please let me know your thoughts.",18,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991637468338013}"

He basically ""proved"" he isn't alcoholic by going 5 days, no drinks (*did smoke on day 4 but that may be incidental, he always has a cig when he has to accompany this person on a smoke break/meeting, & the meetings happen like once or twice a month only*). Thing is, I don't think the way he drinks is normal but he doesn't see it that way coz in his book (*had uncles who died of alcohol-related issues who used to get black out drunk almost daily*), getting drunk means passing out. Therefore __he__ never gets drunk. It's either that or he knows he has a problem but doesn't actually care so he lies to everyone else.

And when I say overboard, it's like 80% of a 1L bottle of vodka/gin/rum in a night. And no, he doesn't go overboard every time he drinks either. But if you asked me what the ""stressor"" triggering this much drinking is, there doesn't seem to be any. A big red flag to me is that he doesn't even recognise when he's tipsy. He thinks he's perfectly sober while he's clearly not.

Could it be psychosis?,"My dad has been in hospital 2 weeks after his friend rang my mum and told her he couldn't get off the sofa, even to go to the bathroom, and was refusing food and water, only drinking red wine. 

He's not been a part of our family for nearly 30 years now, due to his alcoholism, but me, my mum and my brother managed to convince him to go to hospital. He's been sober since he went in, albeit on meds to stop any withdrawal. He spent the first week pretty much sleeping and eating, not very coherent on the phone, second week seemed like a remarkable improvement. He'd managed to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom  (he was very proud of that) and sounded almost like his old self (I'm pretty sure he's done some damage to his brain from a few falls he's taken, so some of the slurred speech and slow thinking is permanent now). 

Today I received a call from my mum, informing me his friend had been in touch with him, and my dad was in bits after being told he had 2 weeks left to live due to liver failure. My mum has spoke to both my dad and his nurse, as have I. The nurse has reassured both of us that he has in no way been told that. They've done a CT scan on him, but still need to send him for an ultrasound tomorrow. But my dad is convinced he is dying. He's having panic attacks, crying and begging me to visit him (which I can't because we are still on lockdown until Wednesday). He also told me my brother had phoned him up, which again is untrue. My brother hasn't reached out to him at all. 

Is this alcohol related psychosis? Is there any way to talk my dad down from the ledge? I'm worried his body will follow his brain, and he is adamant that he is going to be dead in 2 weeks time. What can I do to help? Or I'm I beating my head off a brick wall? 

I'm in the UK (don't know if that makes any difference) and any and all advice would be welcome.

Tonight he told me he doesn’t know how much longer he can live like this.  I’ve suggested speaking with a therapist or joining a support group but he just tells me I don’t understand and I’m treating him like a “random junkie”.

I broke my arm on October 3rd and couldn't work. I can't until February. The state I live in is paying me injury leave which is amazing and is literally saving my life. My mom and step-father are holding onto my shotgun because I became suicidal.  

I went to visit my dad, step-mom, and twin, 3 year-old half-siblings in Pennsylvania last week. While I was there I decided I wanted to move there to be a part of my only siblings' lives. So I told my girlfriend, whom I live with, that I was leaving after the decision was made. We had been talking about separating because we know we're not right for each other even though we love one another. I'll be living in the mother-in-law house behind my dad's house.

So I'm now sitting in our house, alone on Thanksgiving, drinking by myself though I know I shouldn't be but I can't stop. I keep crying. It's 7:00 and I haven't eaten the dinner my mom dropped off yet because I'm just not hungry. I've said goodbye to most of my friends. And it kills me to leave my home. In ten days I'll be packing whatever I can fit into a tiny trailer behind my Honda element and driving my life 3000 miles away, with my cat. 

I'm going to be in school when I get there, trying to get an education in something I'm not passionate about. I've been a mechanic for 5 years, it was the easy route but I was miserabke.

Hoping that when I get there I can truly stop drinking, even though people my age socialize with alcohol and I need to find new friends. 

I don't know why I wrote this other than hoping someone can share some wisdom or stories that make me feel better. I feel hopeless. Like I can never be happy without alcohol. Like I'll never find a job that fulfills me. Like I'll never be able to start or provide for a happy family.  Like I'll end up dead before I accomplish anything. 

Please share any books or resources that have helped you and might help me. I need help. I'm losing my health insurance after I move and won't have my counselor or psychiatrist anymore.

Sober today at least, yay. Sorry for the long post, I just need to vent.

So the year started pretty okay - I managed to get a referral from my doctor to a psychiatrist in January after months of battling this with myself. (I don't live in the US, just to clarify.) I have other mental issues as well, most likely borderline, however still no diagnosis. It was a huge step for me to be able to admit having a problem to anyone, but my doctor seemed to care at least. I felt like there was hope.

Then the pandemic hit. I wasn't able to meet my psychiatrist until June. I was very candid with her though: told her I can down 1,5 bottles of wine in an evening easy, and that this is something that happens pretty much daily. I told her about my other issues - including possible borderline and anxiety - but it seems that after that she just clung onto my anxiety and didn't care at all about what I had said about my issues with alcohol (or a personality disorder; I tick all the damn boxes of borderline, but... crickets). I was pretty bummed out.  


 I know I am an anxious person but that is something I've learned to live with. Alcoholism? Not so much. But she was kind of... how to put this - evasive about the subject, it seemed. I don't know why. I am a nice looking woman, pretty fit, smart, witty, always make sure I look ""decent"" when I go out etc., so I don't know if she just thought it wasn't possible. (Sorry if that sounded like some weird humblebrag, heh, I find it hard to ever write anything positive about myself so it comes off awkward.) Anyway - I felt like I wasn't the typical alcoholic or something?! I had a few calls with her but she always rushed through them (in all honesty she must be busy) and it was ALWAYS just about my anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. I tried to get a word in about my drinking and mood swings and dependency issues etc., and she was supposed to check in on me last month but I didn't even receive an e-mail.

I had a couple of calls with a therapist as well; short ones, only 30min every 2 weeks, and she also just evades the subject and gives me idiotic (sorry not sorry) coping mechanisms about my anxiety. Such as ""why don't you go out and hang out with people in a café."" I could not believe my ears... Geez. Just so you know, the country I live in is NOT faring well with the virus so obviously I wasn't going to follow her *great* advice. I got so sick and tired of this that I stopped taking her calls, and yesterday just sent her a pretty strict e-mail explaining that my main issues are not being discussed and I REALLY need help, so if she cannot do it, could she perhaps refer me to someone who can. (Still no reply.) I feel a bit bad about it but... I am running out of options.

I also lost my job which I absolutely *loooved* in September - right before my birthday. So now that I don't even have that as a motivator I feel just totally lost. I have no motivation, no incentive, no will. I've reached a kind of a ""fuck it then"" phase, I suppose.

My partner regularly loses his shit at me and he can be pretty terrifying when he's upset. I am much, *much* better now (...at least!) in controlling my mood swings, but that doesn't matter to him. He just tells me I am a horrible, selfish person and I just need to ""act normally"" (my past and my other likely underlying mental problems don't seem to concern him, as if I just chose to have an abusive mom etc.). It's been pretty devastating to be honest, and I have just lost my way completely.

I don't even know if I want to be with my partner anymore, as he doesn't seem to be able to wrap his head around the fact that I'm actually struggling with something instead of just loving this alc life (spoiler alert: I hate myself for this).

Yet I'm afraid to leave as well. We do have good times also, however recently - as the virus keeps surging - he's getting more and more antsy and irritable as well, and smokes weed every day, sometimes starting before noon. I noticed I kind of use his habit to justify mine; like what am I gonna do, sit here sober while he is high as a kite? Nice little excuses everywhere amirite, hah. 

But our relationship has soured and the frequent, aggressive outbursts from him have made me feel even worse about myself. I have only a few friends whom I haven't been able to see at all and it hasn't been easy, it's just the 2 of us and our pets hunkered down in a city apartment. No access to nature, nothing. I am so tired, I don't know what to look forward to anymore. Every time I dare to hope for something, it gets worse and then I do what I do best: drink.

Sorry for the lengthy ramble. I don't know who can help me now if my therapist just opts out. I feel like I've tried, but everything keeps failing. And I really need outside help for this... I didn't used to be like this. :( I used to be happy and quite sociable regardless of my anxiety. Now I'm just an antisocial drunkard, slowly withering away, letting my life slip by. 

I feel sad, angry, frustrated and hopeless. Often I just cry myself to sleep.

I have told about my situation to my friends and my siblings who have been great, but they are not experts and cannot really offer ""that kind"" of support either (nor do I think it's their job to offer it, they are not my therapists after all). I feel totally alone and useless, like this life has been lived already so I might just get drunk at least, and feel okay-ish for 4-5 hours.

Today is a major holiday in the US. Even though the US is still in the midst of the 2nd wave (yay!), this is still a major day of gathering, food, and lots of focus on consumtion. Many of us are likely staying home but still celebrating somehow, or possibly seeing a few people in our ""bubble."" Or maybe your family doesn't care, and is having a big gathering anyway. I don't know your life.

Thanksgiving, leading into the holidays as a whole, is prime time for heavy drinking. More than that, it's a time where you are walking into lots of unique social drinking, and places where people keep offering you drinks, even if you refuse. 

Then, you may be swayed to drink (even if you know you don't want to) because of the company that is surrounding you. Are they drinking? Are they annoying? Do you want to join in, or drown them out? Are you tired, and need the pick me up? Or are you too wound up, and need it to come down?

Something inside you will want to accept the drink. Wine will be available, because it's always available. Why wasn't it like this when you were 16? Aunt Pam brought 3 bottles just by herself, wut? It's so easy to have a glass. Then four.

If you slip up, forgive yourself. This is important: forgive yourself in REAL TIME. Forgive yourself AS YOU ARE HOLDING THE GLASS. It will help you stop IN REAL TIME. Punishing yourself in the moment will lead to falling off and overindulging. If you find yourself drinking today, or in the near future, talk yourself through it and remind yourself that you can do this slowly. Remind yourself about the last time you were sick and hungover, and made promises to yourself. Remind yourself that humans are not infallible.

If you begin punishing yourself in the moment for making ""a mistake,"" it may lead somewhere darker. Look towards the light instead.

You don't have to win every battle, every day. It really comes down to small choices every day, every hour. If you make a choice to take that one drink from Aunt Pam, then fine. You can make a different choice the next hour. Remember what it feels like to say no. You can have that control back very soon. Re-center, and breathe.

That started in July, and lasted about 6-8 weeks getting as drunk as possible every night. Eventually, I just stopped completely cause my family began to become concerned about these habits, and for good reason. 

Roughly a month a half ago is when I stopped. I noticed about a week after I stopped, I could no longer sleep AT ALL. No matter how early I go to bed, how long I stay in bed, nothings matters. Just can't stay asleep longer than 45 mins at a time. I know this could be from me not exercising and my diet as well, but I've been unable to refrain from drinking completely.

My dad (50M) has had a drinking problem for probably about 2 and a half years now but it’s gotten significantly worse over the past few months. My younger brother lives with him and I live about 15 minutes away, and there’s been multiple times my dad was supposed to get my brother from work but was passed out drunk on the couch and wasn’t able to. He drives when he is drunk, and we live in a big city, so the chances of him hurting himself or someone else is very high. For example, last Thursday, he came over with my brother and brought dinner. My brother told me he had been drinking at a restaurant beforehand, and when my dad got to my house he proceeded to drink 3 white claws in about an hour; and then drove himself and my brother home. He also stopped at a gas station on the way home to buy more alcohol. This is about an average night of drinking for him. He also has a top secret security clearance, so getting a DUI would completely ruin his career. He also tends to get pretty belligerent when he is drunk too and it’s at the point where I generally don’t want to be around him. I’ve been wanting to have an intervention for awhile, but my other brother is probably the one who he would be most likely to listen to (he’s the favorite child by far) and he’s stationed in a different state with the navy. We are planning on talking to him during Christmas, however. 
My dad has this selfish, stubborn attitude and thinks nothing bad can happen to him, so I really don’t know how to get through to him. He also definitely has a chronic anxiety disorder and I think getting treatment for that would help tremendously, but I feel like it would be almost impossible to have him go see someone. I have a minor in addictive disorders from undergrad and I’m a current medical student so I have a decent knowledge of the pathophysiology of addiction and the effects of alcohol abuse, but he won’t ever listen to me. Just wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar situation and can give me some advice on how to handle the situation.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971229434013367}"

My family is comprised of about 80% alcoholics or addicts in some way or another. I had issues with sleeping pills in my teens but I got clean at 16. 

However, now as I approach 20, it's worse. I'm a 5ft tall 100lb female and can down a whole bottle of wine by myself. Which I used to do regularly until I became intolerant and started feeling sick after just two glasses.

I didn't want to stop drinking though. Thus, I started getting high before drinking so that I could drink more, since weed makes it harder to throw up. I got back on the pills but now I add some anxiety meds to the mix. Maybe 4 of the sleeping pills and 3 of the anxiety meds. Then I drink until I fall asleep.

I've had something to drink every single day for the past month or so and before that I was already a regular drinker, but I could stop if I wanted to. I could go weeks without drinking and it wasn't an issue. I didn't crave a drink when I woke up in the morning, but now I do. I get high more days than not too. 

I'm sober as I write this, though. The only thing that kept me sober today was the fact I had stuff to write for uni, and I'm already counting down the hours to drink again. 

I know I have a problem. I know I have to stop. But I have no motivation to do so. 

How is it possible to get over this problem when I don't even have the will to do it? 

I haven't told anyone about this because I'm so ashamed. It's hard to even admit to myself that I have a problem, even though I so clearly do.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981305003166199}"

I know I’m able to limit myself regardless of the environment I’m in, but I often choose to keep drinking because I enjoy the sensation, hence suggesting the physical dependency and why I’m struggling to stop.

I guess the question is, how do I transfer my addiction toward something healthy?

Doctor dosed me with 120mg of valium over the course of 4 hours until withdrawal effects subsided. 
He then sent me back to detox with no backup plan at approx 11pm. 
Around 10am the next morning severe withdrawal effects began again (confusion, hot/cold sweats, agitation, pacing, shaking violently) once admitted I had a minor seizure. Was treated with 20mg IV diazepam and 80mg oral diazepam which left me with only minor withdrawal effects. He was reluctant to provide any sort of taper schedule, which seems very unsafe to me. 
After some arguing he provided me with a script for 2.5mg diazepam with directions for it only to be administered in the case of extreme withdrawal symptoms by my detox staff.

I know you all aren't doctors and everybody's bodies react differently.

My intake is usually about 8 light beers or so and a couple shots of fireball on Thursdays. And on Fridays and Saturdays id say I consume probably 10-12 light beers and 2-3 shots each night. So roughly 40 drinks a week. I never really drank that much at home until quarantine,  used to be mostly at bars.

I am lying in emergency room half unconscious listening to the conversation. The doctor walks upto me and asks how much do I drink daily. Still a bit conscious seeing my parents standing there I said approx 250ml daily. He closed the curtains blocking my view of my parents and asked again. I lied again but this time i told around half a litre. I was so ashamed of telling the truth. I was admitted in the hospital with a case of acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse. 

My blood was tested. The liver panel values which were supposed to be bellow 50 were crossing 2000. I could see the look on doctor’s face how his expression changed from a poker face to an extremely surprised look. I know his exact thoughts were how could someone so young could have abused alcohol so much. I was told acute pancreatitis majorly occurs in people who have been drinking for a lot of years. Majorly after the age of 40. It was rare for someone so young to be diagnosed with it that too due to alcohol abuse. 

When I was lying in emergency room I saw a patient on a stretcher being rushed towards me and his bed was just placed next to me. Instantly  a breathing tube was put in his mouth and an oxygen mask on his face. He was unconscious. I heard the nurses and doctor talk. They were saying he’s here for the third time. Later I found out he had liver cirrhosis. He was admitted twice before. He was here the third time. And diagnosis you ask ? Complete liver failure due to drinking. Sometimes we just cant stop right. 

When I was in the hospital room my parents walked upto me and asked when did you drink so much ? My parents had no idea I drank this much. Initially I started blaming them for my situation I said if you hadn’t filled my head with garbage that drinking is bad for you and let me be I would be like any other average joe drinking normally it was your constant nagging that forced me to go this far.

 Did you know there is no cure for pancreatitis? No medicines for treatment & recovery ? The only thing you can do is don’t eat anything don’t drink anything so you don’t put unnecessary pressure on the pancreas and let it heal. Thats all you can do. I was told I could never ever drink again in my life. Never Never Never Never. Because your pancreas becomes sensitive to alcohol. When I heard that it was like a bomb has been dropped on me. Oh my god I will never be able to enjoy the sweet nectar of gods ever again. What will I do when my friends drink ? What will I do in parties ? What will I do in clubs ? What will I do on holidays ? All these questions started rushing through my head. 

Let me tell you about my condition in hospital. My stomach was swollen I could not drink anything I could not eat anything. For 4 days I was just given fluids through the IV. The days were bad and the nights were terrible. During the day I was agitated hot and in pain. I was sweating in a cold room. I was in so much pain that even to move a little bit caused a pain so excruciating that radiated from my abdomen to my lower back. My mother was there beside me till the end. I used to see her while I was almost crying in pain. Her tears. I kept thinking in my head what the fuck did I do my mother is crying because me. How did I end up there. 

I was given pain killers 3 times a day to ease the pain. But it was no use. It felt like candy as it did not even reduce the pain by 1% At night I used to scream & cry in pain. I was sleepy but I could not sleep due to high levels of pain. I called nurse every 15 minutes and asked her to call the doctor for medicine. I was even given painkillers at night along with sleeping medicines. I remember one night I was in a lot of pain. Doctor saw it. He gave me a pain killer. He warned me that its only used in cases where the patient is in extreme pain. But the medicine is so strong that if used a lot will certainly cause kidney failure. I went for it. IT DID NOT WORK. After 15 minutes I was again crying in pain. The nurse gave me a sleeping pill. No use. The pain was unbearable !!  

After 4 days the pain started reducing. I was introduced to water again. I could only have a couple of small sips whenever I wanted to drink. I was still revolting so I drank an entire glass. Bad choice. It hit me so hard that I curled up into a ball tears out of eyes. It was painful. 

7th day I was given juices & coconut water time to time. To drink that juice was heaven for me. I did not realise that drinking juice will make me cry. I missed it much so. I missed the food. Even thinking of a standard bland dish made me crave it. I was not feeling much pain till then. But a little extra movement and there is the pain. I used to press my abdomen to check if it was still paining. For 10 days I could only pee. I remember on the 6th day I peed and it was celebrated as an achievement. Who could have thought peeing could be an achievement. 

On the 10th day I was introduced to food again. My menu A bed tea Porridge for breakfast, a light balanced meal, a very light balanced meal. I remember eating for the first time in days. The pleasure I felt. That cheap hospital food tasted like it was out of a 5 star restaurant. The 2 biscuits given with tea felt like these biscuits were made specially according to my whims & fancies. I guess the quote is right ‘you don’t know what you have until its gone’ 

The day i pooped decided when I could be discharged. Before I was discharged I was given counselling. I was told 90% of the patients soon return with same problem. They do not change. I guess it was reverse psychology as I replied I will never drink I will never come back. I promised my parents I promised my doctors. I promised myself that I will be a happy sober man. I left the hospital after 12 days. 

I was a changed man. I had a changed mindset. My routine changed drastically. I woke up. Went to work. Came back home by 5pm. Actually started sleeping by 7pm. When I used to drink I was up until 12am. So that was a change I had more time. I changed my diet completely. Lost 8kgs. I was radiant I was glowing. I was a changed man. I was completely healed. There was no pain. Thinking all is fine I started eating a bit unhealthy but that was fine. 

Then one evening when I was coming home. I said to myself. I am healed a lot. All my blood tests are now completely good. My liver is healed as well. So I decided why not buy a bottle of whisky to celebrate. So I got a 250ml bottle. And went home. I was thinking earlier I used to drink neat. That’s the reason I got pancreatitis. If I dilute it with water. I will be fine & it will not impact much. And earlier used to drink without a pause direct from bottle so I will now slow down the pace. I poured a 60ml drink & added another 60 of water. I started drinking slow. It was no fun. Old habits die hard. Next one i galloped. Within a few minutes all was done. As I was drinking after a few months the alcohol tasted funny & hit me really hard. I dozed off within an hour. Next morning I did not feel any pain. 

Thinking now I was fine I again bought a bottle. I guess within a month I was back to my former self drinking about a litre whisky daily. I even lied to my girlfriend about my problem. I told her that the doctor has said I can drink from time to time. She was so innocent & naive. She trusted me and let me have a few drinks whenever we were together. I forgot to mention. I have a gf since 2015. She, for 2 years believed that I have already cut down on alcohol. I made her believe that she changed me. I was a different man because of her. But behind her back I was galloping 1.5l a day. 

Drinking this much people might think how in the hell can my parents even my own girlfriend did not doubt me. Over the years I grew quite resilient to alcohol. It took half a litre to make me walk funny. So drinking small quantities during the day did not show any significant changes in my speech or my walk or actions. So no one was able to guess that I was under the influence of alcohol all the time. 

Back to the story. I was back to my former self. I went on a trip with my girlfriend. You already know where I am going with this. I drank and drank and drank. From beer to wine to whisky to vodka. And not just in parties. I remember I used to wake up early while my girlfriend was still sleeping. I would go out. Look for a wine shop. Get half a bottle of whisky. Bring it back. Hiding it from my sleeping gf. I took it inside the hotel room bathroom & galloped it down. Came outside ordered some breakfast. Ate it so my gf could not smell alcohol on my breath. I used to do it daily for a week we were there. 

After returning home. I was again back to drinking 1.5l daily. And within days I started experiencing the same pain. Not severe. But the same. I remember that day it was January 2017 morning. I was in my car. Holding my abdomen with one hand & drinking whisky with other. I drank the bottle. And I instantly puked inside the car on the foot rest area of the front passenger seat. Thats when the pain enhanced to the level it was unbearable. I tried subsiding it taking a pain killer but no use. It was hell. I waited in a mall’s parking for an hour holding my abdomen in pain & crying. Sweating in car with AC on max. Thinking how I am gonna face my parents. I knew I needed to be be hospitalised immediately. But I did not have the guts to face anyone. When the pain got out of hand. I was done. I got up holding my abdomen. Threw the floor mat on the passenger seat outside cleaned it with water as much as I could and drove off. I hurried towards my girlfriend’s house. 

When I reached her place. I called her and asked her to come out immediately. She asked what happened ? I had only one answer If you love me come outside. She came running. I already changed seats and shifted to the passenger side. She came & sat on the driver’s seat thinking I do not wish to drive. She asked me again what happened ? I just said I did it again & asked her to rush to the hospital. I did not have the guts to go to the same hospital and face the doctors. Throughout the entire drive I was sweating profusely. Crying holding my abdomen. My gf was consoling me everything will be alright. We will ask the doctor why it happened again. YOU DONT EVEN DRINK NOW. Hearing that I drowned in pool of self loathing. What the hell did I do again. She got me to emergency. Where I was admitted. Diagnosis : ACUTE PANCREATITIS

I started drinking when I was around 17 years old just outta school waiting for college to start. Around April 2012. My friend introduced me to alcohol. It was first for both us. People usually hate the taste of alcohol when they drink it the first time. I was not I cherished every last drop of it. I think the reason for me liking it so much was because for 17 years my parents told me alcohol is bad for you. And being a teenager I was naive and eager and that constant nagging about alcohol made me want it even more. 

So college started people party people study people make friends people build relationships. I on the other hand befriended a couple of friends who liked just staying in college. I was an exact opposite I rarely visited college. My attendance was below 15%. Now let me explain in details what I used to do everyday. Drinking started small like 2-3 drinks a day. It takes people time to become highly addicted to alcohol. But not me within a few months I was drinking 0.5L of whisky everyday by September 2012. 
My daily routine wake up get ready wait for the wine shop to open buy 0.25L of whisky open it drink it straight from bottle i guess my record for 4 seconds. Have a couple of cigarettes. Doze off for half an hour in car eat something very very unhealthy then reach college call a friend of mine lets go out. Play a bit snooker. Have lunch. Visit the wine shop. Buy another 0.25L straight down. Eat something unhealthy go home. Smoke till i cough and go to sleep. At that time it looked like its a good life as i was under constant influence of alcohol. I was always I could do anything. I am the best. No one can stop me. But that was all in just my head. In real life I was just drinking. 

By the time my college ended in June 2015 I was drinking 1L of whisky everyday that too NEAT. I knew the implications of getting a liver disease. But I thought it was long shot & my actual mentality at that f**cking point of time was SO WHAT THERE IS ALWAYS A LIVER TRANSPLANT. Its cool. I can get a liver transplant. Lets drink more. 

By that time I was working. My routine. Wake up get ready go to wine shop buy 4 miniatures. Drink it right from bottles. Eat unhealthy. Go to work. Before lunch go to wine shop. Buy another 0.25L drink it eat unhealthy. Think I can do anything while doing literally nothing. Go to work. Pass some time. Around 5pm go to wine shop buy 0.5L. Go home. Have 0.25L eat dinner. Have another 0.25L and pass the f**k out. I usually blacked out. 

I remember some times when I woke up I used to find piss on my bedroom floor. I did not even had the motor skills to reach bathroom I guess I just woke up and pissed on floor & went back to sleep. 
I remember one day I bought a stock of whisky around 4L as the shops were gonna be closed for 3 days due to national holidays. I was at home. Drank 3L in 2 days. That day when I was left with only 1 bottle. I by chance broke it. You know what I did. I picked up the pieces of glass. Got a cloth. Cleaned the whisky & emptied it into a glass. I recovered whatever I could. And i drank it. That i was my first night sober in last 4 years. I could not sleep that night. My head was heavy my eyes were rigid my hands were trembling like crazy. I wanted to pull out my hair. 

Till 2017 I had the same routine. Its not like I was not aware of anything. I used to read articles about alcohol poisoning liver cancer cirrhosis. But you know THERE IS ALWAYS A LIVER TRANSPLANT. I was so f**king dumb. 

In august 2017 i decided i wanna stop drinking. I did not drink the entire day. And when i went home I started experiencing a pain on my right side below the chest which eventually started rating to my back & abdomen. I first I though it was gas & took a medicine for it but by midnight the pain was unbearable. My parents rushed me to a nearby hospital where I was given strong pain killers. Early that morning was taken to a good hospital. I was in excruciating even after the pain killers. I was rushed into emergency. I was drugged & i was lying unconscious when I hear the doctor & my parents talking. That was the first time I ever heard the word PANCREATITIS.

My mom is an alcoholic and I have grown up around alcohol my entire life. 
Over the course of this year is when I really started to notice how bad the effects of alcohol where having on my life. 
In April I drank a 40 of vodka within 2 hours. I passed out on the living room couch, with my two year old and 6 year old there. My 6 year old had to call an ambulance because he thought I'd died. 
My alcohol levels where actually so high that I was lucky I didn't go into a coma. 
I had my kids taken away from me for four weeks and it was the worst time of my life. 
I am there primary caregiver and there dad hardly puts in any effort to see them, so they are always with me. 
I quit drinking and was a month sober, until summer time I went to a friend's and decided to just have a few drinks.
 So my drinking continued, but I was able to have a handle on it.
It was all fine until I was raped the middle of September. 
My drinking started spiraling again. I would hang out with my mom almost every day and get drunk with her (that's seriously the only bond we have. )
This continued on some more until I found out I was pregnant from that night. Once I found out I was pregnant I stopped drinking, and was even thinking about keeping it, because it would have given me a reason to actually get sober for a long period of time. But I already have two children and I was so sick every day being pregnant I could not take care of them properly so I had an abortion. 
Since having the abortion I have been wanting to drink almost every day because I am in such a dark spot. 
I have controlled myself to only drink four times a week. But every day feels like an intense struggle and a constant fight with my internal diaglouge weather I should drive to grab some drinks or not. I've been really trying to get a handle on it, I cut my mom out of my life for now. But on Thursday I got so drunk I blacked out with both my kids at home and when I woke up I was having a shower. I still don't know how I even got into the shower.
I don't know where to start or go from here , I feel so broken and lost, and all I can think about even now is having a damn drink. I know I need to be a better mom then my mom was , and if I get my kids taken away from me I will kill myself because they are the only light in my darkness. But I'm just so nervous for the future. I know I could never tell my family if I quit drinking because they will all make fun of me. 
I really wish I never grew up in such an environment that normalized this type of thing so much, because I know I am now projecting it onto my kids. I want to be the best mom I can be I just have no idea where to start and I'm scared I'm not strong enough to do it",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9933542013168335}"

The effects are entirely different. That being said, if it worked and made me not want to drink somehow, I'd be all for it. The other issue that might come into play is the lack of regulation and research around it. Kratom has saved a lot of people from what I can tell, short term, but there are few reliable studies about its long term effects. What if it's just as bad for your liver? What if it has weird unforseen health consequences? Obviously drinking is terrible for your health so I guess it doesn't matter...

I had tried to get help, but the doctors told me that I'm not an alcoholic unless I drink all day everyday. And that made me so angry.

I hit my breaking point 2 nights ago. I got way to drunk and blacked out and did some terrible things.

I woke up with my leg completely bruised, like I can't were pants because it hurts so much, and I think my hand is broken (it's a weird bone to break because you don't use it very much and I've broken it before so I'm just going to tape my pinky and ring fingers together and tensor bandage it)

I also woke up to my boyfriend being fed up with me and everything I'm doing. I lost everything in a single night.

I know it's my fault, I know I should have done something sooner. And I can't stop crying because it hurts and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is basically my only friend and I lost him.

A question for those in the know. I recently started Naltrexone and have been investigating TSM to resolve my 1.5 year history of AUD. It's interesting, and I can buy into it. My drinking pattern has always been blackout binges (3-4 bottles of wine) during depressed periods, but these only occur every 7 days, every 14 days, once a month, and at my best, once after two months. Point being: I have no trouble abstaining for decent periods of time, and it's only massive infrequent binges that get me.

Is Naltrexone and TSM appropriate for this drinking pattern? Any modifications to optimize? My goal ultimately is indifferent, not abstinence, but I'll take whatever progress I can get. It's hard for me to wrap my head around beginning to drink daily using Naltrexone when that's never been my pattern.

From 30 to 32 I would go on and off. there were times when I had maybe three drinks in a year over that period but I wasn't completely sober, obviously. 

This year was my year though in spite of all of the challenges globally. I never used quarantine boredom as an excuse to get hammered. I'm pretty proud of that because I spend most of my time being lonely, my biggest trigger. 

So what have I accomplished in my year of sobriety? I have lost 55 lb, gotten a nicer car (sweet ride), gotten a nicer place to live that is larger, although I don't really like my job I got more hours which means more money, and I'm just overall clean, organized, efficient and the complete opposite of chaotic, how used to be.

Stability, routine, structure. I feel like a completely different person and my mental health is finally under control. To anyone seeking sobriety but not really feeling AA, you can do it! You got to want it!",125,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9349827170372009}"

I also posted this to r/relationship_advice but I feel like I could get better help here. This is where I'm at:

My wife drinks too much. Her drinking picked up after we got married two years ago. It's really picked up since we've been under quarantine and home all the time. She has at least 5-6 drinks per day. On bad days she has 10+ drinks. I've not seen her take a single day off drinking since we've been home full-time in early March. She drinks at whatever hour she wants, including the mornings. Sometimes she has trouble sleeping and stays up drinking after I've gone to bed. I handle the recycling, and it's a lot of bottles. It's also not cheap.

She does enough work for her job, but she definitely could do more (we are in very similar jobs so I know based on my work). She never does anything risky like get behind the wheel; she just loves to drink at home for whatever reason. If she's sad, mad, celebratory, stressed, bored, or just unwinding, she drinks. She used to try to hide it, but after I found out she now does it openly. She partially justifies it by pointing to celebrities who post selfies with glasses of wine at whatever hour and blame it on #quarantine, but she's a regular person with a regular job who can't just drink all the time. She drinks too much, and it has to be bad for her health.

It's overwhelmingly the biggest cause of our fights. I can't talk to her about it. If I ask her to cut back for any reason, she gets extremely upset. At best, she'll get pissed and say she'll come to me if she thinks she has a problem (and then usually won't talk to me for a day or more). More often, she accuses me of being ""controlling"" or not respecting her as an adult if I talk about her drinking. I try not to bring it up, but I'm not perfect and I do try to talk about it occasionally. We tried couple's therapy, and she flat out lied to our therapist about how much she drinks, and it led to some really terrible fights (the therapist wasn't helpful because they kept saying, ""I'm not there; I don't know how much she drinks,"" whenever we'd tell her two different things about her drinking). I think that we'd be in great shape if she cut back -- she's my best friend and we can definitely thrive together -- but she is so attached to alcohol.

We're both in individual therapy, and I sense she isn't honest with her therapist about drinking. Our therapists have spoken, and my therapist intimated that her therapist is unaware of the extent of her drinking. Last session, my therapist kind of blurted out a question and asked if I'd considered talking to her primary care physician about her drinking, and I never even thought that was a possibility. She doesn't have a PCP, but she has an OB/GYN appointment in about two weeks, and it's a new doctor because she's on a new insurance policy. Part of me thinks this is a bad idea, but should I find a way to communicate to her new doctor that she drinks a lot in hope the doctor will talk to her about it and maybe shed light on what it's doing to her health (including running some tests to see whether she's already hurting herself)? How would I even do this? It strikes me as a bad idea but my wife is very intelligent and would listen to a credible expert, so I think a doctor could communicate this message the most effectively. Part of me thinks this is my best hope, short of my wife having a serious crisis.

Anticipating some of your feedback:

No, I'm not leaving her. I made vows, and those included ""sickness"" and ""for worse."" Addiction falls under that umbrella in my book.

I agree this seems like a bad idea, but the only reason I'm considering it is because my therapist mentioned it. I've tried to talk to her family about it, but her parents are somewhere between ""hands off"" and ""heads in the sand."" My wife gets very upset if I talk to other people about any problems we're having, so I have to be diplomatic.

Yes, I know about Al-Anon, but it's kind of hard to join a support group when we are home and together all the time. I will continue to read and educate myself, and I know that she has to want to stop drinking. I'm just wondering whether talking to her doctor could spur her to want to stop drinking.

I'm not trying to control her or to make her feel awful. I just know she's drinking a ridiculously unhealthy amount, and we both want a family some day. I'd love if she could just cut way back and be able to take days off.

We aren't planning to have kids right now but would like kids in the future. 

tl;dr: My wife drinks too much. It's the biggest problem in our marriage. Should I try to communicate to her new doctor that she abuses alcohol so that the doctor could try to talk to her about it? If so, how do I even do this?",3,{'quarantine': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9963867664337158}"

I don't mean to hijack this sub or even if this is the right place to post this question. My brother was hospitalized about six months ago, under very mysterious circumstances. He had some issues with alcohol in the past, but swore on his childrens' lives that he wasn't drinking again. He had two very bad seizures which landed him in the hospital in a coma. After three weeks, we were finally told that he was in the beginning stages of liver failure. He refused any treatment programs, and vowed to stay sober. 

Let me pause here to explain that I am not a stranger to addiction; I have lost quite a few friends over the years to heroin, alcohol, and meth. I know that an addict cannot usually just ""stay sober"", so I had no illusions that this would be the case. However, since he refused treatment, my family and I continued to check up on him, try to help in whatever way we could emotionally, etc. Again, he was swearing that he hadn't been drinking, but we all pretty much knew the truth. 

Tonight, my mother called me to tell me that she had just gotten off the phone with my brother, who was convinced that his children were at his home. We knew this to be false, because the children were with their mother (which we verified). He raged on and on about how they were there, and when pressed to put one of them on the phone, he proceeded to act like he was calling out to one of them, saying ""you have to come talk to (my mom), or else she's going to call 911"". He kept this up for over fifteen minutes before my mother hung up and called the police. They went and did a wellness check, and said that he was still convinced the children were there, and that they had an ambulance on the way. The ambulance came and checked his blood pressure and blood sugar, and the officer was able to convince him that the children weren't there eventually. My brother called my mother and said that he recognized that he was being delusional, but he still refused to go to the hospital or seek help. 

My question is this: what can we do? We live in Kentucky, where there is a law called Casey's Law. The police officer told us that unfortunately the courts wouldn't be in session over the weekend, and that in order to seek an application of this law, he would still have to be acting erratically in this way on Monday. By then, he will have likely settled, which makes me think this law will not help. So then we would begin this cycle all over, and I'm not convinced that he will survive until there's a ""next time"" to try and have that law applied. Do we have any other options? Can anyone help me? My family and I are so exhausted and have tried everything. I literally buried a friend's ashes last month who went through liver failure, and I do not want to have to do the same with my brother. 

TLDR: My alcoholic brother is in some stage of liver failure leading to hallucinations and I need advice on how to help if he refuses treatment.

At the moment a friend of mine is going through a really difficult time and I have been here the last two weeks to help take care of them since the person's caretakers have been diagnosed with corona. 

Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue but I've just gone through a really tough break up around the time I was asked to step in and help. It's pretty tough overall I'm not going to lie since I am responsible for most of the household tasks, helping take care of the person's caretakers aka parents and making sure there are enough supplies in the house. The person also has a disability meaning I am also the emotional support for this person around the clock at the time.

Mostly my day consists of taking care of this person from around 9 am until 3 am and working for a few hours when they are asleep and grabbing maybe a couple of hours rest a night myself.

I also have other friends going through difficult times who also lean on me for emotional support right now and frankly I am finding myself feeling suffocated. The only time I get to sit and think or rest somewhat during the day is when I use the restroom or take a shower and even then sometimes people will be knocking on the door with questions.

I know they can not help their situation so I don't take it out on the people but I do feel agitated at times but I try hiding it behind a smile.

Right now it's making it very very difficult to process my break up and I'm catching myself smoking a lot of cigarettes and drinking frequently again.

Then a couple of months later one day I just decided that's enough.

My daily drinking on average was about 500-600ml of liquor, 80 proof or stronger (and I'm low weight) so I looked into tapering. There was also some advice on here, but most of it was actually very discouraging, which is the main reason why I'm even writing this post.

I came up with my own plan and this is how it went in the end..

* Day 1 I had a drink a few hours in the morning after getting up - when the withdrawal was already getting quite bad. However, I only drink just a little. Not nearly enough to feel 'well', but enough to make it a little more bearable. I continued like this throughout the whole day, and needless to say the day sucked, spent most of it wanting for it to be bedtime sooner. And finally it was, so I fixed myself up to the point I felt 'well enough', so that I could have a proper sleep. Overall that day my intake was down to about 200ml of liquor.
* Day 2 I didn't touch anything until mid afternoon and then continued with the exact same thing as on day 1. Although what was different was that I actually felt fairly good throughout day 2.
* Day 3 Only started in the early evening, and again following the same principle as usual.
* Day 4-7 I had one drink late in the evening/night shortly before sleeping.

The day 4-7 evening drink was because my taper was pretty aggressive, and even though I knew what 24h sober looked like, I wasn't sure what would happen after, say, 48h. So in a way I was easing my body into it. Now I've been sober for 2 days and I'm not touching any alcohol anytime soon, perhaps ever.

I think, things that helped me was a serious determination to quit and to quit on my own. Also having some kind of plan, and sticking to it. Cardio definitely helped me, doing it every day or even twice a day. Eating better (and more!) probably helped as well.

So I think using tapering to quit is very realistic if you're really determined to quit on your own.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967777132987976}"

I am 53 (F) with a long history of abusing alcohol. I have been arrested for DUI, crashed my car,  missed family events,  been to rehab, on and off antibuse. I have been in and out of AA.  I use to drink Vodka first thing in the morning to feel normal. 

I am a mother of two - my children have been me drunk and passed out. They have had to come see me in court. They have had to deal with their mother disappearing for days. 

My husband has had to go pick me up from the hospital after I collapsed in public. I cheated on my husband as I found others to enable my drinking. 

So today I am so proud of myself. One year of not drinking even through a frigging pandemic. So how did I manage a year ?  The last ten years it was no drinking for 2 or 3 months then BANG - binge , hungover, guilt, shame, promises to stop. 

1. I got honest with myself - when I was in rehab a doctor told me that my brain lies to me. As a somewhat intelligent person - I have a post graduate degree in engineering. How can my brain lie ? Believe me , your addiction doesn’t care about how smart you think you are. 

2. I stopped making promises - I started breaking it down to day by day. If I just didn’t drink today I would be good. 

3. I made my health my priority. Stuck to a sleep schedule. Exercise everyday even just a walk. Eat properly. Have desert everyday. 

4. Most importantly I took the time to think about my life. I really don’t want to die. Even after being in the hospital to get my stomach pumped I didn’t stop drinking. I finally realized that I want to live and alcohol was going to kill me. 

5. I made changes in my life. I realized I was sick and tired of alcohol’s merry-go-round. I admitted what wasn’t was working in my life, put aside my ego and made changes . 

Everyday I am thankful I didn’t drink. 

Keep trying if you are struggling. Be kind to yourself. I had to make a conscious decision to be happy. And alcohol was making me miserable. 

Today my husband and I are still together and better than we have been since we first started dating 34 years ago. My children are adults but they now have a supportive mother.

I'm used to having a job and people relying on me to be at peak performance; without that im just idle.

I miss my hobbies, I miss tinkling with Linux servers but im at the point where I won't be interested in anything until my buzz is up; and clarity comes from drinking. I miss having that clear head! 

Today was the earliest in my life I started drinking. 7am. I told the guy in the off licence out of shame Id just finished a night shift...  I hadn't slept but I wasn't working at all, i lied - I couldn't sleep because of the booze wearing off made me jittery.

I havent been in this hole for long, maybe a month or two this time but I'm terrified. I quit meth twice but the availibility of this shit, it's everywhere! I've been a bartender / hospitality worker for 8 years and been fucking good at it but I can't do that anymore. I love it but that's gone now I gotta find somthing else; I gotta dig my ass out.

Depending on how I sleep tonight I'll try and make tomorrow my 'birthday'. I miss the rooms. I really do. I'm gunna do an online one and try not to drink for 24 hours again, and take it a day at a time. I keep forgetting that. One day at a time.

Someone - help me; give me the impetus to follow throw, message me sometime in 12 - 18 or a few days and just ask how I am, if I've drank and tried the zoom rooms? I don't need coaching and I'll answer honest I just need someone to be that checkpoint on the horizon to focus on.

I (31F) have had unhealthy relationship with alcohol since I started drinking at the age of 14 or so. I've never drank just to enjoy a drink or a cold beer in the summer - I've always done it with the sole purpose of getting wasted.

First it was because of my shitty childhood and trying to deal or rather forget the trauma. Then it became a coping mechanisms for terrible social anxiety. After that I was in uni and getting drunk is what pretty much everyone is doing, right? Then I got depressed and, yes although I know now that alcohol is actually a depressant, I used it as a way to forget my feelings for a bit and just chill. Anyway, there was always something happening that would make me drink. Or so I thought. It took me years to stop making excuses and realise I have a problem.

In fact, I realised it was a problem about a week ago. I spent the last few weeks getting drunk every single night. And right now there's absolutely no ""reason"" for that. I'm healthy, quite happy with my job, in a great relationship, life is good (well, if we forget about Covid for a second). And still!

Surprisingly, my drinking has never affected my work and I am perfectly capable of getting up in the morning and go on with my day. Even more strange for me is that my hangovers are not as bad as they used to be. What started worrying me though is that my liver hurts. A lot. It started a few months ago and I'd feel it only if I'm sitting in an uncomfortable position or something but now I feel it almost all the time. Sitting, standing - doesn't matter.

I really don't want to get myself into a hospital or worse so I thought I'd just quit. Turns out quitting drinking is harder that quitting smoking and drugs combined. That's based on my personal experience, I suppose it's different for everyone. 

I really need an advice! I have no idea what to do. How do you deal with the urges in the first few days/weeks? Does it get better?

Until this latest quitting attempt (taking various recommended supplements and getting back into intensive exercise) I'd been drinking quasi-regularly for ease-of-thought for writing, maybe 15 units a day (cider, therefore high-sugar, possibly cause of inflammation et al.) for a week every month, alongside social stuff.

Weirdly I seem to think considerably better in low ambient temperature, whereas the smallest amount of caffeine shuts my brain off pretty much completely (alongside a general hypersensitivity to stimulants).

Brain fog also worsened considerably after bingeing for several months whilst on anti-depressants (venlafaxine) several years ago.

Apart from perhaps occasional bouts of hypomania I don't appear to be exhibiting any withdrawal symptoms.

Does this sound familiar to anybody? Especially unfamiliar? Does anybody have any advice? Do you have any questions?

The questions are:

""how much alcohol CAN the average human consume?""

""how much alcohol DOES the average human consume?""

""What is the alcohol consumption range of a person that classifies themselves as an alcoholic? (to any degree)""

Of course there is somewhat of a set standard in the DSM-5 for what constitutes Alcohol Use Disorder.

[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-use-disorder](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-use-disorder)

What I am more interested in is the actual applicable and measurable number of drinks that the average person can/does consume.

The average number of drinks that a self (or professionally) diagnosed alcoholic consumes.

&#x200B;

I have had a lot of different levels of drinking in the last many years. There was a point where a 6 pack felt like a huge problem and there have been points where 25 shots a night felt like my lowest point. Although through both of these I classified myself as an alcoholic, I never truly knew how much the average person drank. The question first arose when I partook in drinking with my father and had to gauge how many 5% beers I could have before somebody would say ""are you sure you're OKAY?"" I pretend that I drink like a normal, median, and statistically average person in front of my friends and loved ones. I do not know how much that is. Is it the standard 2 glasses of red wine with your fish dinner? Do you just sip on it until the bottle empty? Is it inappropriate to open a second bottle? Can you finish that one too? In the end I am left with the same burning question that I can never seem to get an answer to. What is the median? How much does the average human drink on their Friday night happy hour?

&#x200B;

It has become a life goal of mine to control my drinking. I am an alcoholic and I consume far too much. If I continue drinking the way that I am currently, I will die. I want to stop. The purpose of this post is to help gain perspective on \[my consumption\] versus the \[average consumption\] and to use this as motivation to guide myself to a better, happier and healthier life.

If anybody has any questions, I have written down and logged every single drink I have had in the last 2 years. I track the dates it is consumed, the quantity and the type.

One drink is based off of the following NIAAA article.

I used to drink up to two bottles of wine a day to deal with my depression. 

Lately things have been really hard for me. I suffered a really terrible loss (missed miscarriage) and my depression has hit an all-time high. I’m basically miserable all the time and spend most of my day sleeping, crying or on my phone. I can’t afford therapy at the moment either. I’ve always wanted to be a mother my entire life. It was a driving force in me getting sober. And the pain of losing them has been unbearable.

Despite everything I haven’t had the urge to drink at all through this hardship. I’m sure a lot of that has to do with my partner’s support. They were also the main reason I quit drinking in the first place. I also want to try again for a baby and that’s another big motivation as well. My future baby deserves a mother who is sober.

But even though I’m proud of myself for not having the urge to drink while going through this grief, I still sometimes have very vivid dreams where I’m drinking again. And they’ve only increased since my loss. And when I say vivid I mean they feel VERY real. Like I’ll be stumbling and slurring my speech and everything. I’ll even have moments in the dream where I feel bad that I “slipped up” and drank again.

But the worst part is how happy I feel in the dreams where I’m drunk. I was a very “happy” drunk back when I was drinking. And even though I know alcohol is a depressant, I honestly haven’t really found anything else that makes me feel all giddy and carefree the way alcohol has. I don’t wanna say I miss the feeling because it was toxic af and terrible for me and everyone around me, but in my dreams where I’m drunk again I’m always laughing and smiling and having so much more fun than I have had in the years since I quit.

Again, I feel like I have to stress that I’m NOT tempted to drink right now. But my dreams just keep reminding me of the feeling. And I hate it. I don’t want to remember the “fun” of being tipsy and how everything was so much funnier and more enjoyable while drunk. I’m done with that part of my life. I’m never drinking again, even moderately. 

It’s just incredibly frustrating to deal with. I’ve never been the kind of person who can control my dreams so I’m not sure what to do.",42,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5384802222251892}"

Does anyone know of any books that address the aggressive or destructive attitude of the person who lives with the alcoholic?

My mother is an alcoholic and after being sober for almost 5 years, is closet drinking again. She is not nearly to the point that she was at years ago, but my siblings and I are afraid that if she doesn't get a handle on her recent slips soon then it will not be long before a full-blown relapse has occurred. My sister and I have spoken to her openly about it and she has expressed that everyday is a struggle for her right now and she is trying her hardest and admitted that sometimes she has bad days. By no means is she getting sloshed, but every few weeks I can tell that she has had something to drink (though barely detectable to someone who would not know her). While we are taking a supportive approach right now, our father has the exact opposite approach. He is old school and thinks that alcoholism is a full on choice and ignores the fact that it is a disease. Basically he comes in with the ""smarten your f\*\*king sh\*t up or else!"" tactic. Basically he has her walking on eggshells right now and I am trying to convince him that angrily yelling at her and having a shit attitude about it will not be productive in any way.

He likes to read a lot so I was hoping to get him a book that would help him better understand what she is going through and better understand what kind of attitude is productive and what kind of attitude is destructive to the cause.I have seen the books ""Beyond Addiction"", and ""Get Your Loved One Sober.""Does anyone have any feedback on either of those books or have any other recommendations?

Any ideas?,"Quick background: I went on about a two and a half week binge, the last week of which I drank from sun up to sundown -- typically a 750ml bottle of whiskey. The last few days I tapered off a bit with beer, about had 8 light ones spaced throughout the day. Prior to the binge, I hadn't drank at all for about 6 months. 

I've felt relatively fine during the last few days, no shakes or anything like that upon waking up. I've had a stuffy nose due to the drinking, but at night time, about 3 hours after my last drink when I go to sleep, I experience this weird breathing issue that comes on about once a minute  -- it's like as soon as I start to slip into sleep, my brain thinks I've stopped breathing and I get this rush of anxiety in my chest and need to grasp for air, stretching out my lungs as much as I can. I can only describe it as a sort of restless legs feeling in my chest that comes on with a wave of panic and  keeps me from sleeping. This happens about once a minute until I eventually fall asleep after about 4 hours (5-6 hours after last drink).

It's strange because I don't have the jitters or anything like that upon waking. It seems related to my somewhat stuffy nose, but it also reminded me of sleep apnea or something like that. I'm fairly fit and healthy in my early 30s, so my mind wants to believe this is some weird sort of withdrawal symptom.

Apologies for the poor description, but it's so hard to describe this rush of panic/anxiety/tightness and this mental need to gasp for air -- especially how it comes on a few hours after my last drink at night and then weirdly subsides. I know I've been on a serious binge for 2 weeks, but I've never felt this in all of my past drinking binges, many of which went on longer. I was a hard drinker for most of my 20s and then got sober a couple years ago, with short relapses here and there. This one definitely was the worst.

I've been letting a friend stay on my couch because her living situation changed suddenly. She was making good progress, she found a job and hadn't been drinking for about a month.

Unfortunately, she started on a bender that has resulted in a DUI. two hospital trips (one after she was arrested as a precaution, the other for detox after she was found drunk in front of my apartment complex). Because she was drunk outside,  (a few times now, since the DUI incident) our apartment manager is now involved and now we have no choice but to kick her out. This all has happened in a matter of days. 

I talked to her this morning, and again in the evening, letting her know she has to be out by morning. She made like she was heading to put some of her things in her car (she got that back today) but actually just went out to drink in the parking lot of the conveinance store nearby.

We've brought her back to sober up, and my current plan is to baby-sit her until then, help her pack and physically make sure she gets settled into a hotel or something like that.

There are plenty of things I should have done differently, but my questions now are: 

1. Is there anything else I can/should do?
2. She wouldn't let me get her keys so that her car could be brought back. Any thoughts on the best way to do so?

I (23,F) have dealt with my alcoholism since I was 13 years old. This was unusually young to begin an alcohol problem and I have suffered for a full decade. In many ways, my lack of sobriety in my formative years has made me an outcast, a liability and a bad person.

I have been to the hospital many times due to excess drinking and I have lost many relationships to alcoholism. I have humiliated myself time and time again. I am tired. I am tired of the vomiting, of apologizing, and most of all, I am tired of the loneliness.

My father has not drank in 35 years. He believes AA saved his life. He is my best friend. I want to make him proud. I want to stop drinking forever.

I feel that I am at a crossroad in life. I have 2 options, I can continue drinking and watch my life fall apart over and over as it always has. Or I can take control, I can stop drinking, and I can see actual changes.

It has come to the point where I understand that not drinking at all is my only shot at a good life with real meaning and growth. I have spent years bargaining with this fact, hoping there was a way around it, but there isn't. It's black and white, no grey areas, and I see that now. 11/13/20. I hope that for the rest of my life on this planet I can say that this was the day of my final drink.

If you believe in prayers please pray for me, I will pray for all of you. I am sorry to ask for this but I am really afraid. I am afraid of myself. I am afraid of the power alcohol has over me. But I know I can conquer it. It will be the toughest fight I've ever faced. I don't know if I'm ready but I don't think I have a choice anymore.

Last year she did blood work, heart and kidney scans and said everything looked normal. However I have avoided getting a physical with my GP. I’m mostly terrified that I’ve completely screwed up my liver and I’m ashamed of talking to the doctor about it, I mostly just feel shame and embarrassment and also fight or flight panic when I think about going to the dr at all especially when it comes to admitting I have a drinking problem.

We all love him, especially my mom and we just want to be able to live his life to the fullest. 

He started drinking ever since he was a teenager to cope with the daily life of being poor in Jersey. There were some stories where he told us that one time guys would throw rocks at him and his brothers for no reason. Then his father would constantly tell him that he wasn’t going to amount to anything in his life because he didn’t want to become a Jehovah witness. His father would beat him with anything he could get his hands on. My dad is now 56 years old and successful. He proved that he wasn’t going to end up being worthless and decided to start a family of his own. 

He would do anything to make sure my family and I are okay. He would always be there for me and would always show me the love that my grandfather never showed him. Everything would be alright, but the problem is that he doesn’t seem to care about himself and how his drinking problem is affecting his life. He would drink about 3 to 6 bottles of beer each day and he would usually be too full to eat then he would fall asleep for most of the day. He would always buy a pack or two of a 18 pack each week and he would be finished with it by a week. We know it’s not healthy for him to do that and tonight my mom and us tried to talk to him about his drinking problem again. But he would usually say the same thing and nothing would usually happen after the talk. 

My mother started to cry and tell him that she doesn’t care about anything but him and she’s suffering too by seeing him not taking care of himself. It’s hurts me seeing my mom cry because she would always be tough enough to handle everything. Please if anyone know how I can approach my dad about this. Or know of any advices then please I need it now.

People, food, soda, weed, experiences, anything. Not necessarily in a bad way, typically. Like I want to make sure my friends are taken care of to the point where I'm often giving too much in a friendship or since I was a child I've always been depressed for a few days after I did something super fun, like a vacation or something. I just love to be happy and hate for enjoyment to end. 
I was diagnosed bipolar at 22 and it completely makes sense. 

ANYWAYS.

My main vices that have gotten to a worse place have been food (I have an eating disorder) and over the last few years it's been alcohol and I'm fully aware of how bad those got. 

I've recently decided to start eating better, no alcohol, etc. Well, I'm feeling better with no withdrawals except I've been start to experience sleep paralysis. 

I'm not seeing demons, but I'm in situations that start out as a dream, I all of a sudden can't hear and just get a loud ringing/whoosing sound and my legs all of a sudden give out and I can't get up and it becomes unbearable. Then within my dream, I began to get reactions from the people around me and their reactions become very intense and scary. Then I realize I'm asleep and try to open my eyes or move and I can't and I can feel myself panic. Then I get a vision of either my boyfriend, mother, or father trying to wake me up out of the trance I'm in and then I get confused on if it's actually happening or if it's a dream. I wake up in a full panic and it's so hard to fall back asleep. 

Right now I'm on hour 34 since I've slept because I tried to fall asleep three seperate times and it happens each time. I'm scared to sleep, but if I don't sleep I recognize the signs that mania is creeping in. & on a side note, it's probably even more amplified because a week ago my cat passed away unexpectedly and ive been in an intense depression and I'm sure that's just adding to it. 

I'm really at a loss of what to do and I was hoping I could get some words of advice or if anyone has ever been where I am before?


TLDR: I've been in a bad place lately and decided to start eating healthier & stop drinking. I've started to experience sleep paralysis, causing me to not sleep, flaring up my mania symptoms, and I almost prefer it to the depression, but i fear the crash.

We have been living together for the last half a year because of covid in their apartment (still have my own place that i havnt been going to because of roommates who are high risk of contracting covid) and we have been planning on moving in for almost a year now. We recently got into our first big fight when they expressed that they no longer want to move in together because of my drinking. 

Throughout our relationship i have been truthful, honest, and followed through on every commitment i have ever given them. I quit smoking at the beginning of our relationship and whenever i did something i was not proud of (like having a periodic smoke...i can count on less than one hand how many times ive had a smoke since quitting) I would express that it happened and be forward about it. They spoke with me twice about drinking and both were in context of the bar (from my perspective). First time was that we would go out frequently and stay out late and id drink a lot when we were out and the second time was that i would ask them if i could have another one before leaving. After both discussions I made behavioral changes. I stopped going out as much both with and without them and would not drink as much as well as stopped asking them if i have enough time for another so they were not the ""gate keeper"" to fun as well as not consume as much when we went out. 

For context i drink on average about 5 or 6 light 4.2 abv beers a night at home. Give or take 2 in either direction. I drink them over the course of 7 to 8 hours. I enjoy the taste (yea i know light beer really). I never drink even a sip of alcohol when i have to drive, I do not drink before 5 PM (with the exception of the 4th of july which is an all day BBQ with a lot of guests), i avoid drinking to the point of getting drunk, I dont drink if I have to take meds (such as antibiotics), i did not drink when i had to quarentine for COVID for 2 weeks, i dont drink to cope with stress in fact i stop drinking so i can fix my problems, and if i get full or dont want to continue to drink i will dump a beer even if i just opened it. It has never interfeared or been a problem in my life with my professional or work life until recently with my partner having concerns. 

Back to my issue at hand. My partner has an issue but has no feedback on what i can do to alleviate and move our relationship forward. I have not had a drink since (about 9 days now which is fine. I want to work things out before i drink again) but thats the only thing i can think of to do. I do not argue that i consume a lot of alcohol and that I can drink less but i do not know what else i can do. They do not know themselves. They expressed its concerning for health reasons and I agree that I can drink less. I just dont know what to do beyond not drinking at all because i feel that if i drink around them they will have an issue now regardless of the amount. Not to mention my trust is a little broken from the perspective that they would break away from our future rather than try to work through it and discuss it.

We are on good terms, get together for family stuff (as we can) and talk once in a great while.  He's a good man, has a good job, and we're trying to be good parents.  Here's how it is for now.

First, the son of a close friend just got popped for a DUI, lost his job, had to detox for a week, and is now in rehab.  We would like to take that hint, and intercede without overdoing it.  We have asked him to stop by, and he will eventually.  

Second, a close friend has told us that my son has driven home while completely hammered.  This is not good - duh.  Uber won't cost that much and there are people where he lives who would eagerly, and could readily, give him rides both home and back to get his truck.  

Finally, there seems to be some research that suggests addiction has an inherited component.  Whether nature or nurture isn't important right now.  What does matter is that I can count at least 5 family members with problems in that area - not his immediate family.   

At this point, we just plan to tell him our concerns, insist he get rides (hell, we'll pay for it!), and ask him to look at his habits right now.  Do you have experience in this area, from either perspective, that might help us?  TIA!!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965817332267761}"

I disregarded the the traditions though, I began to idolize my AA mentors and they all turned on me, my entire support network crumbled in under 2 weeks and it's a massive blow to my happiness.

I live in Perth, Western Australia, i would try to hang out with the young people and this was ok at first. However, it came to light that they were telling people not to take their medication prescribed by their doctor! This caused many people to have psychotic breaks and some have committed suicide.

I stayed away from this cult that had grown out of the useful program of AA. I had one Saturday group that was my home group and an old timer took me under his wing and we became great friends.

A few months ago he became resentful and accused me of not helping out in group conscience, even though I chaired the meeting every night and did service by getting to my homegroup 40 minutes early every week to help set up.

He began chatting shit about me, a 70 year old! I confronted him and then I washed my hands of him, I thought he was a silly old man.

My next friend was 80 and she had been there for me for 2 years, but she changed as well! She became patronizing, would verbally attack me if I took an interest in her wellbeing, and eventually she began being racist towards me! The woman who was my mentor was now destroying my confidence.

I left and I haven't been back for 2 months, the only reason I'm still sober is because I have the online AA meetings which are great! 

I met an old member and explained all this to him, he backed away from me fast and acted like I had the plague. I feel so alone, but this program means a lot to me and I'm not ready to give up!

When we met neither of us drank, through uni I hardly drank as we had promised each other we wouldn’t (we went to separate universities) I drank once whilst at my uni however when we met up we would drink. I think he may have been drinking more than he said he was during that time. He liked experimenting and would often drink different spirts to push his tolerance.

Fast forward serval years we’ve both graduated uni and now live together with his mum. We are saving for our first house and marriage but I’m very concerned about his drinking habits.

He was arrested this summer for drinking and driving, he was two times over the limit. That wasn’t the first time he had driven whilst drunk. He always said he was under the limit and was of sound mind and knew what he was doing. He wouldn’t listen when when I told home how dangerous it was. A lot of the time I’ve realised he down played how much he drank as his tolerance has increased and he can hide his level of drunkness quite well. 

Before he was arrested I had been telling home I was concerned and he started speaking to a therapist to show he was proactive in showing he was in control, ironically the day he stopped speaking to his therapist is the day he got arrested for DUI.

I was in the car and we had drank cider a bit at lunch as we went on a picnic I didn’t finish my drink(I’m not much of a drinker) and he finished my cider and had some more (I didn’t realise how much more he had) we went out on a drive after dinner that day. I get annoyed at myself because I ignored the signs but once we were stopped by the police my breathalyser showed I had no alcohol in my system and I thought he wouldn’t either but was so disappointed when he was arrested for a DUI. It had been hrs since we drank meaning he had been drunk way more than he let on.

Since that incident he stopped drinking for a while but has continued to drink.He isn’t aggressive when drunk or anything but he makes excuses to drink , he will say football is on and he will go out with a friend and get drunk. His mum doesn’t know he drinks (he’s an only child) no one except his one friend and me know he was arrested and can’t drive for a year.

I’ve noticed he tries to be sly about his drinking and we argue about it from time to time. I just don’t want him to go down this path, this issue is really bothering me and when I question why he needs to drink he says he won’t drink but goes out and buys alcohol and says I’m being controlling.

So am I being controlling? How do I make him see he is feeding a bad habit. 
He always has to finish a drink, I’ll happily nurse a drink and he will finish his and finish mine because he says it has to be finished. 


I get angry that I can’t say anything to my mum or his mum or even my friends because I don’t want to betray his trust but I need to talk to someone about it. 

I know he wants to propose me next year but I truly don’t know if I can say yes whilst I don’t see him changing this.

I just know he is someone who tends to fall into habits easily. Everything else is fine it’s just this.

We met at his dorm room and he was having a small party, he was drunk, shirtless and signing “Call Me Maybe”. From there, he was polite, a gentleman and took me around the city we lived in on amazing dates. I quickly met his family and he met mine. 8 years late I look back and try to reason why I didn’t see the signs.

He has the most extreme of extreme social anxiety, he would drink before classes especially when it involved presenting. He would drink while around my family, around his extended family and around any friends. He tried medication for his social anxiety, it didn’t work and ended up giving him extreme side effects. He says alcohol has been the only thing that makes life livable. He’s not depressed though. Alcoholism runs in his family. 

He’s been joking lately about mixing pills while drinking and often has days where he’s 20 shots deep (I know I didn’t believe it either until I witnessed it several times). He still functions like normal when he drinks except that I’ve been noticing him saying he can’t live without it. I do notice without access to alcohol he’s quickly agitated, shaking, and feels like his entire body aches. He says even before he drank as a kid he would feel like this. 

We have our issues. He never ever comes to visit me, he opts to stay near his family. My emotionally needs aren’t met, just say “drink it off”. I’ve been more isolated during this pandemic than ever and my depression is crushing. I get he can’t visit me all the time and often works long hours since he works at a private school with boarders. But I went to grad school, worked at a start up and traveled 3 hours each way on the weekend to see him.

I’m scared because he gave me herpes (he had it before and I never thought about it, until I got it myself) and now I’m truly scared I’ll leave him and never find anyone who will love me. He’s made me feel truly unloveable during fights and knows exactly what to do to strike me to my core and destroy me. I’m now isolated, no friends around me during this pandemic and still far away from my boyfriend traveling an hour each way to see him. 

I love this fun, lovable man to the core of my being. I know he loves his alcohol more than me, in fact he told me that before. But 8 years later, I feel like I got none of my needs met. He says he got a job that was more stable for me since he was out of work for 3 years... feels like manipulation to me.

I’m 28 and have been out of college for about 5 years.  I used to be a pretty heavy drinker in college (shocking, I know) and while I don’t drink as much after graduating, I will still to this day get drunk 1-2 days a week. 

I feel like one of the main appeals when I was younger was “losing myself”, and that drinking gave me an excuse to say or do what I wanted. It also skyrocketed my confidence. I don’t really get these feelings anymore. Don’t really know how to explain it, but that fun level that falls between sober and drunk has become such a small window, or on certain nights, it’s nonexistent. There’s also been some times recently where drinking will make me sad, anxious, self conscious, or paranoid instead of feeling happy or free (this never used to happen for me).

90% of the time I drink now, it feels like a chore. My tolerance is much higher than it used to be. I used to be able to get pretty hammered off a few beers or shots, but now it can take a 6 pack just to get a small buzz (also realizing that this in itself is becoming concerning). I generally feel bloated and gross before anything else. Also, hangovers are completely intolerable now. I literally have no will to do anything except eat fast food the next day, which in turn probably makes me feel worse. 

Going to the bar has just been one of the main activities I do with my wife and friends (luckily my wife has also been feeling the same way about drinking lately too). My friends and I have a deeper friendship than just “the people I drink with”, but drinking is just one of the main activities we do with each other. Not worried about losing friends or anything, it’s just not sure what activities would replace getting “shitty at the bar”.

I’m nervous that there’s really no benefit to keep drinking, yet there’s always that voice in the back of my head suggesting “this will be more fun/exciting if you’re drunk”. Thinking it might be time for a lifestyle change before this becomes something that’s harder to control. Maybe just reducing my drinking days to special events or holidays?",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992222785949707}"

I am a recovering alcoholic with about 5 years of sobriety. I was i guess what youd call a low bottom alcoholic not that that matters i wasnt dependent but couldnt stop once i started. 

My brother and a couple of our friends have turned into pretty severe alcoholics 20 plus drinks a day. My mom and my friends mom are leaning heavily on me to try to help their sons due to my past problems. I have given them all the wisdom i can and explained its ultimately in the alcoholics hands. I have tried many times talking with my brother and alcoholic friends but it goes no where it seems.

The motherswhere in denial and i did bring the truth out in regards to how much they were drinking and how it was endangering their life and they are drunk driving so endangering others lives. I just couldn't watch them destroy themselves or kill someone else. Now i am feeling like a narc but i dont know. I think addiction thrives when its hidden or allowrd to hide and i couldnt watch people i love do that anymore. I mean its not like they got too drunk at a party this is nonstop alcoholism.

It wasnt like it was a secret, one look and i think anyone with a brain can see they are alcoholics. 

Did i do the right thing? Is bringing addiction to light appropriate? I dont want to watch them keep suffering needlessly. They shouldnt through their life away.

Long story short, my husband is depressed and also an alcoholic. He only drinks when our kids are asleep so they've never witnessed it. After a particularly verbally and emotionally abusive drunk episode a month ago, I told him I won't tolerate being treated that way any longer. He cried, said sorry and stopped drinking. 2 weeks later he asked me to go buy him alcohol (his license is expired). I said no and that we should talk about why. He said no and has been drifting further and further from me since. If he's not at work, he's hiding in the den. He doesn't touch me, rarely speaks to me and as of the last few days stopped looking me in the eyes. I know he's suffering greatly because alcohol has always been his coping mechanism and I have always enabled him and abused my power as a strong individual and carried our family mostly alone.

He is always lively, fun and engaging with the kids despite being depressed but is rarely around since the drinking stopped.I want to keep as much normalcy as I can in their lives during this time. I am a very strong person with an equally strong self identity. I know it's intimidating to him and I know he thinks it buys him time because I can carry on really well even when he's falling apart in the background. His toxic relationship with his parents is what fuels his depression. He works for his Dad and is constantly taken advantage of, with his Dad taking half the pay without doing any of the work to fuel his hoarding addiction. For him to truly thrive in life, he'd have to quit his job. I have an independently contracted job that could support us if I could do it full time. I have asked him to quit for his own good and the good of our family and I get met with bitter anger for that. It honestly seems like since I've gotten my job and there's an actual out for him he's gotten worse. Because now it's real, there's no excuse for him to stay at his. My fear is more of myself than him. I'm afraid I'll carry on longer than is healthy and let myself be destroyed carrying our 4 kids on my own. I am currently  continuing to try to initiate conversation and being loving and encouraging to him. But when and how does that need to change? I love him, I see his potential and want him to be free but I dont want to enable him in his depression the same way I did in his alcoholism.

Man, alcoholism is such a frustrating condition. It is so troubling to know that my compulsive daily drinking habits are deteriorating my mental and physical health and yet I’ve failed to go much more than 24hrs without a drink in a long while.

I’ve also started learning about the neuroscience of addiction and how I’ve likely been predisposed to this behavior. This is helping me to focus less on shame and more on what to expect and how I can heal.

I often make friends with people who (like me) want to keep the party going after the bar closes or want to sneak around the corner and have a joint. Not abnormal behaviour in your 20s but in your 30s it starts to create a bit of a selection bias in the kind of people you associate with.

So been drinking about 2 pints of vodka almost daily for the past 2 months with some 1 day breaks. Come 11/05 I drank 3/4 of a 1.75L bott, woke up next day okay usual morning hang over good by 12pm. Now the dumb part. 

Drank the same amount AGAIN. Apparently this was my bodies breaking point. Woke up feeling dizzy and nauseous, but still manageable. I could not keep anything down. By the 8th vomit I started puking what looked like blood. And boy at this point I could feel the dehydration setting in with dizziness. I thought of everything, cold water, hot chicken soup, everything came back out with this black looking thing (blood and lining). Tastes very acidic. This went on until I start getting really bad dehydration dizziness and called it quits. Had someone drive me to the ER. Somehow I don't remember much at the ER except not understanding why the nurse was not sympthethetic to the extreme dehydration I was experiencing and pain in my throat. I would have paid cash just to get an IV in me. Memory fades at that point. Wake up 36 hours later at a hospital that has a special department for withdrawal. 

Got a FALL risk strap on my wrist on my hand because my legs were wobbly, still are. I'm not exactly sure what they did to me. I literally have a catheter patch on my thigh, I was told I had it for 2 days. Hooked up to heart machines. I have a huge 3 inch by 2 inch bruise on my right arm with some like glue residue around it that I don't know about. And I have to be on drug for 10 days to keep the mental part of withdrawal away. 

I think I dodged a bullet. I think If I wasn't drinking so much lemon water for pleasure I would of croaked sometime in the morning. Sorry my i'm writing incoherent. BTW they said I tried pulling the catheter out, apparently it sucks have a pipe larger than your urethra shoved up your urethra. Figured I'd post this incase any is thinking about boozing badly. I also shit myself the first day at the special hospital.

My brother has been a severe alcoholic for more than 15 years.  About 12 years ago, his wife and kids left him, and since then he's been on-and-off living with my mom or living in a shelter.  He has gone through a CONSTANT cycle of drinking, losing his job, stopping and detoxing, and getting a new job (repeat). My mom has always been his safety net.

Sadly, my mom passed away two weeks ago at 77.  Since then, my brother has been on a horrible bender; he even missed our mom's funeral.  Two days ago he admitted himself to a hospital, and has been detoxing since.

I saw him yesterday, and he told me he wants to go to rehab for 30 days (this would be his 4th stint at rehab).  He seems genuine, but I don't have the money for that, and no one else in the family is willing to pay for it.  In fact, I'm the only person left who hasn't cut off contact with him.

After he is released, he has no money, no home to return to, no one to support him, and the grim reality that our mother is gone.  His phone is currently disconnected and the hotel room he was in is trashed.

I can't pay for his rehab, but I think it's important to help him put his best foot forward for this very last chance, now that our mother is gone.  I was thinking of lending him $5000, which I'm aware I may never see again.  I was also going to allow him into our mother's house, supervised, to pack a bag (I washed all his laundry and put his things in boxes that will go into a storage unit).  After that, I don't know...

In six months, he will get a large inheritance of about $300,000 -- but until then (for legal reasons), not a penny.  We were *hoping* we could legally put that in a trust to only give to him if certain conditions are met, but the way the will was written, that's not possible.  He gets that money, and he may very well drink himself to death with it.

Any ideas or advice?  I leave Saturday to return to Japan, where I live and work.  After that, he's on his own.

Sorry if this was hard to follow; I'm juggling a million things with my mom's estate on top of this and trying to get home to Japan despite covid.  My brain is scrambled eggs!  Thank you for your help.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993422627449036}"

My mom has been battling severe alcohol addiction for at least 20 years or so (that I know of) and it's gotten to the point where she is about to drink herself to death.

For example - she just did a 7 week stint in rehab and immediately got blackout drunk the moment she got back to her hometown. She's been in rehab at least half a dozen times.

She's aware she can't go on living like this... in fact, she is the one who even found her most recent treatment center (even though she doesn't remember it). Unfortunately I think through a combination of damaged mental reward pathways combined with years of abusing her body and malnutrition, she in incapable of staying sober on her own.

It's only a matter of time before she stops breathing for the final time or falls and cracks her head. My family is ready to have her committed but to me that sounds like the most horrible end for her.

So, I know that nobody can stop if they don't want to stop, but I feel like she would be very receptive to an alternative like Ibogaine or Ayahuasca. At this point even given some level of psychological or physical risk, the alternatives are pretty bleak.

I’ve gone through a lot in my life, from childhood to an extremely abusive relationship for almost 10 years where a lot happened to me. My life is now better than it’s ever been - I met a wonderful man I’ve been with for a year, am in therapy working through the past stuff, and have a great job. 

Now, throughout my 20s and into my early 30s, I drank to EXCESS. I would self medicate with it, drink alone, black out, do hair of the dog, you name it. I have anxiety, but I was even too paralyzed to do what it took to get prescription refills on Xanax because getting to the doctor for the controlled substance fill so frequently was hard with everything going on. However, alcohol had the same effects and was easy to pick up.

Because it became a habit to drink this way, I still sometimes struggle and fall back into old ways even though there’s no reason to self medicate now (I know a lot of people blame quarantine but I don’t think that’s a valid excuse). I’m terrified this means I’m an alcoholic even though it seems I’m getting “better”-I am in no way drinking at the level I was before, but there are still slip ups from time to time, and I become unaware of my limit (I don’t handle my alcohol as well as others around me/cannot handle the volume others drink). 

Has anyone had experience with this? I’m surrounded by people who drink, and do drink excessively often, so it’s hard to gauge.

I really didn't know she had a problem until I saw her looking up AA in the car on the way to my house. It broke my heart but also made me happy to see that she was indeed acknowledging the problem at hand. 

Just today her late night drinking caused her to skip trying to get back into school though, and I'm afraid that it is the start of a vicious cycle. I really enjoy being with this girl and do not want to give up on her just because of her issues. I wanted to be with her before I knew the possible severity of these things and I'm prepared to help her out the best I can.  
But I do not want to be her boyfriend and also her parent. Nor do I think it is a good idea for me to be her sponsor if she did indeed start going to AA.

I currently have a therapist, a psychiatrist, am on  tons of medication for schizo-affective disorder (which works well) and I have a good support system of close friends and close family. I also chat on AA online chats.

I talk to my therapist, family, and friends about this but it still tends to happen. I get so angry that I start shaking and yelling (sometimes) and such bad agitation I can barely focus on things. My patience with things is sometimes almost non-existant, and I tend to get frustrated and irritated. I even punched my wall today because I got mad at something that wasn’t even a big deal.

He was super supportive and said no worries, dinner instead. It was a great time with good company and yummy food. But I was challenged for the first time to either drink, or not. The margaritas looked amazing, my friend was drinking a funny looking margarita they served in a bowl!! Lol I didn’t mind he was drinking, and he even offered not too. 

I started thinking, well, they look really good... and I’m finally out... and well I’ve made it a little over a month... so why not? I snapped myself out of it. My friend said “I don’t want you to feel pressured, and no matter what you choose I will not judge you. I just don’t know what your sobriety means to you” BING. A thought that has been lingering in my head since Saturday. What does my sobriety mean to me? 

Anyway, if anyone cares... I have 2 Pepsi’s and some bomb lamb tacos. I am still thinking of that question of what my sobriety means to me and how the real world of my sobriety is not as easy as my cozy, safe bubble at home.

I’m a 33 year old first time dad.  I have been drinking too much for the past 6 years.  It’s hard to say on average, because some weeks I would drink pretty heavy, say 3-4 drinks a night during the week and 2-3 bottles of wine on the weekend, and some weeks pretty light, nothing during the week and just 1-2 bottles over the weekend, and a couple longer breaks.

During the dry spells I definitely had increased anxiety which I think is a symptom of dependency.

My mother is an alcoholic and so was her dad, so that gives me extra worry.

My son was born a little over two weeks ago.  I haven’t had anything to drink in 3 weeks and I feel fine.  I didn’t even think about drinking until a few nights ago, but the past couple of days the urge to go to the wine rack and uncork a bottle has been intense.  I think about it 2-3 times a day.

I don’t want to set an example to my son that regular drinking is normal.  And I want to be able to enjoy drinking without worrying I’m going to turn out like my mom and ruin every relationship I have.

He's had a rough life, and he turned to alcohol to cope from a young age, so he's been drinking heavily for a while. He's 27 now. 

He decided a few days ago that he wanted to sober up, but the withdrawals have been hard on him. He's going to check himself into the hospital, but I'm not sure what someone should do in this situation without an income or insurance. I'm afraid he will need a transplant. I noticed his jaundice has gotten much worse, and his urine is dark orange. He's having severe abdominal pains, throwing up yellow bile and he can barely eat. He has to run to the bathroom right afterwards. And now he can't blow is nose without it bleeding. It's not looking good. 

I'm worried sick. I wasn't sure if there's assistance he could get? Or if he enrolled in health insurance for the coming year if they would cover a pre existing condition that was diagnosed before getting the insurance plan? I know a liver transplant is expensive if it comes to that. I've never had to deal with a major health issue, but I'm trying to find resources to help him.

This will be my first Reddit post ever, so here we go. 

I guess why i am posting is to tell a little bit of my story (skipping boring details) and hope to get a little bit of advice or maybe just some guidance on what to do in my situation. 

To begin, i am currently a 20y/o female. I had an alcoholic mother growing up. I didn’t begin drinking until about 16 or 17, and it was never an issue. The only issue i had was sometimes i would get a little too drunk, and be messy. 
about a year and 8 months ago i moved to another city, and began going out a lot and drinking pretty much every night. It was situational but i don’t think it would help anyone if i explained. So i began drinking pretty heavily and sometimes would have situations, including fights, yelling, and making a fool of myself in general when i got too drunk. 

something else i would really like to let you know is i take a daily medication for anxiety, Lexapro. I have been taking it for probably 4 years now and have been doing all of this drinking while taking daily lexapro. I obviously know that this is a bad thing and it makes my tolerance and drinking experience different from someone who doesn’t take medication. 

Fast forward to now, i have a friend group who drinks pretty actively, we drink sometimes every day. I tend to blackout a lot, which is (in my opinion) due to my medication, and when i begin drinking, i never stop. i will always search for more and just keep drinking and drinking and drinking.  Obviously this is a problem. 

It has become more of a problem for me over quarantine lately and these past few months have been pretty rough for me. I have had several bad blackouts where i have caused really bad problems with my friends that have brought them to the point where they told me i need to get my shit together or we cannot be friends anymore, because sometimes i can get pretty mean when i’m blacked out. 

It’s strange for me because i am a very kind person, with a huge heart and love my friends very very much. But once that alcohol gets too far into my system, it’s almost like i become another person. It’s so sad to watch myself self destructing my friendships and hurting them so often. 

Lately it has been better, i am still drinking almost as much but i haven’t been causing any issues with anyone, only myself. I will admit to you all that there were a couple of days last week where my roommates were away and i drank white claws all day and just sat around drunk, and then would drink with my friends in the evening. This resulted in me binge drinking for about 3 days and then having really really terrible comedowns, i was so fucking anxious and sweaty and shakey. I was also waking up in the morning (well, mid day) and beginning to drink so that i wouldn’t have to deal with my hangover anxieties that i typically get. 

It’s come to a point basically where i know it’s a problem. I drink so that i don’t have to feel things, as i deal with pretty bad anxiety and depression, and i try to just forget everything constantly. I have gained weight, gained memory loss, lost friends, hurt people, i’m assuming killed my liver, and i think enough is enough. 

I need to quit, but i have such a social friend group who loves to go out and drink. Part of me wants to continue to try to drink in careful moderation, but i want your opinion if you even think that is worth it. I’m assuming it’s not a good idea and i should just quit.

One last thing, i am also so so so so worried about the effects all of this drinking on my medication is having on me. I’m afraid i’ve messed with my brain somehow and i’m just really scared about that. 

If i think of anything else to add, i will edit my post. 

Anyways, if you’ve read this far i appreciate the fuck out of you. I would really appreciate any feedback what so ever.

So im 22 years old and have a slew of mental health issues. I used to use weed to self medicate however I was diagnosed with cannabinoid hypermeisis syndrome in 2018 and despite getting my diagnosis, I started to use weed in intervals until I started to feel sick again.

In may of this year I got incredibly sick and stopped smoking all together.

I started to drink instead as a replacement and Im starting to get worried about my usage and I guess that this is my first step in asking for help/opinions on it.

My therapist knows I drink, yet im also smoking cigarettes a ton more as well. 

I guess I just want other peoples opinion on things.

Please feel free to ask me questions in the comments as I feel Im very open about things and dont mind questions.

Edit: CHS makes you vomit to the point that you cant keep anything down. This may, when it flared, I was unable to keep water down for about 3 days but due to COVID i was terrified of going to the ER to get fluids.

I wanted to be pretty, which, as a guy, took a lot to accept. Most of you know how a man in a dress is viewed by most of society. But it's me and my life, so I grew my hair long, bought dresses and got heavily tattooed over all the ugly old self harm. I put *everything* into designing my tats, thousands of hours over 2018 in every spare moment. Art had healed me so I was trusting it to show me the way. The first tattoo session went bad. The artist is brilliant but did something very different to what I expected. Ok. I can adjust. Then I found he'd gone really hard on my skin and in the most detailed bits pieces of flesh started falling off leaving scar tissue and no ink. I was devastated after putting so much into it. After a year sober I started drinking again.

I persevered with the artist (no-one else would touch it) and in time he gave me a sleeve that's prettier than I could have dreamed. All the old scars are covered and I'm now a rainbow of colours :) I was just about to get out and start exploring the lgbt+ scene as my prettiest self when covid arrived and shut me in the closet again. So I'm still stuck in this limbo, making art because nothing else makes sense to me. But I'm getting worse. The process works, I can express myself without fear sometimes, but my alcohol and weed fueled binges are getting worse. When it starts to go ""well"" I get locked in and stay up for days drinking and smoking. That happened once in 2017 but it's happened several times in the last month. I wake up with sores on my face from accidents I barely remember. Fell down the stairs backwards while carrying a heavy model and cracked my elbow. Model was fine. After one binge the skin on the right side of my tummy went numb for a few months.

Until I can go out and dance in a dress and meet people who accept me for who I am I don't know how to break out of this. I'm planning to stop as soon as the weed runs out but I've said that to myself countless times before. I just get restless and anxious and then depressed and hopeless and all the time I *know* that there's this thing that will make it go away. So I end up back here. I just wanted to be free and I'd finally found a way to be a version of myself I could love. I'll be 40 next year so I feel like time is against me. If I start receding before getting to explore this side of me it will take away my hope, pathetic though that might sound. I love all the recent lgbt acceptance but sometimes I get so angry and jealous seeing all the young queer people enjoying life after spending 20 years hating myself for what I am.",5,"{'lockdown': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9865182042121887}"

I’ve been a drinker for 20 years (I’m 39). Never so bad that I’m drinking all day, but the usual cycle of frequent binge drinking, hangovers, fuck ups, regret and apologies. I’ve been thinking for years about quitting, but somehow always find a way to convince myself I’m ok.

About a year ago, my wife was diagnosed with ALS, and that plus working from home (less hangover regret!) has led to me drinking more and more, to the point that I’ve been black out drunk more or less every night for four months. It’s gotten to a point where I’m not doing anything other than work, take care of my family during the day, and then drink all night. This can’t go on, and I don’t want to live my life this way. So today was day number one for me.

I’ve been meaning to get a therapist anyway to deal with the ALS diagnosis, but what else has worked for people? I definitely need professional support. Have people found success with AA?

2020-11-07 13:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jpvuhd/alcoholism_stages_russian_classification/,Alcoholism stages: Russian classification,"I discovered that in Russia the classification for drinking problems differs from the classification in Western countries (what is listed in ICD/DSM). The problems with alcohol are considered not as a spectrum but as a process built from different stages that bring the addict to the same sad final: crippling addiction or death. There's no distinction between binge drinking/alcohol abuse/alcohol dependence, or mild/moderate/hard alcohol use disorder. Instead of this there are 3 stages:

On stage 1 of alcoholism, the addict drinks a lot, but he isn't dependent yet. He can drink every day or once a month, it doesn't matter - but he has the following features:

1. Occasional blackouts.
2. Unability to stop drinking since the addict has started.
3. No vomit reflex already.
4. Higher tolerance.
5. Psychological addiction - the person has psychological cravings, he wants to drink to be intoxicated (for vary of reasons - to feel good/not to feel bad, it depends).
6. More drinking - the person drinks more frequently and needs no reasons or excuses for himself to drink. Probably he invents excuses for some stupid reasons.
7. Worse intoxication - the drunk person can become violent or depressed. The intoxication changes somehow.

On the 2nd stage of alcoholism, the addicted person develops a physical dependence on alcohol. In Russia, most of alcoholics are on the second stage. The 2nd stage of alcoholism has those symptoms:

1. Physical dependence. The main factor of the 2nd stage. The hangovers (which can be pretty mild on the 1st stage, because the body gets used to the high income of the alcohol) gradually turn into withdrawals. The addicted person develops a dependence and next morning after a binge he has to get a drink ""to kill"" the hangover. At first it can work, but with time each attempt ""to kill the hangover"" throws the person into an alcoholic bender.
2. Alcoholic benders. A lot of alcoholics on this stage start to drink with periods - there is a drinking bout which lasts at first 2-4 days, but with the time the benders last for a week/two weeks/month, when the alcoholic just drinks and nothing else. He barely eats, he drinks huge amounts of the booze, he starts to drink some cheap or even poisonous alcohol only to continue the intoxication and/or to get rid of the withdrawal.
3. Highest tolerance. The person can drink A LOT of booze - a fifth, a litre, a handle of booze, and he'll be fine (for a period, at least...).
4. The person starts to drink in inappropriate situations. He cares less about the work, the family, the interests - he cares only about the alcohol. He gradually destroys his life only to get drunk with time.
5. REAL CRAVINGS. The wish to drink becomes unstoppable. The alcoholic on this stage wants to consume alcohol as the ""normative"" person wants to eat or to drink water of he's thirsty.
6. Health problems - pancreatitis, heart diseases, severe life-threatening withdrawals (DT's, seizures), liver cirrhosis.
7. The person behaves REALLY irresponsibly while being drunk - he drives under the influence, says to his boss everything he thinks about him on the work party, becomes violent, beats his/her wife/husband... to be continued.

Some addiction specialists say that there's a difference between the early 2nd stage and the last 2nd stage. On the early 2nd stage the WD's are pretty mild, there's no kindling. The benders last 2-3 days; after that, the alcoholic tapers off for a day-two, usually on evenings, and feels fine... till the next binge. Even if he decides to go ""cold turkey"", he manages to do it without serious complications. The alcoholics on this sub-stage can also drink between the benders, here and there, and to be okay. On this stage the addict can not to understand he has a problem. ""OK, I have binges sometimes, so what? It doesn't hurt my life, I have a job, a family, I'm not some stinky bum!"". On the late 2nd stage the withdrawals are terrifying (Alcohol psychosis, seizures, horrible panic attacks, etc.). The alcoholic person gives up on everything except of the drinking. He/she can to go for a crime to get some booze. On this stage the person either drinks, or is abstaining completely. Even one beer will cause him to go on a long bender, until he loses all of his money or is incapable of drinking. On the late 2nd stage most of the people die because of chronic deceases. Most do not reach the third stage.

The 3rd stage, the most terrifying stage. There's no cure for that, usually. Most of the people who reach this stage, are bums/hobos/extremely poor people. They live only to die soon. The 3rd stage of alcoholism is the latest stage of the alcoholism. Those are the symptoms:

1. Low tolerance. The alcoholic's liver is too fucked up, so he's getting drunk even from small amounts of the alcohol.
2. Worst benders and worst WD's. On this stage the WD is so unbearable that the person drinks all the time, or goes on REALLY sinister benders, which are already are no dependent on a person's life events (the salary day/holidays/stressful situations/etc.)
3. REALLY BAD health problems. The person's heath is completely destroyed, and soon he'll die.
4. Dementia. Korsakoff's syndrome, when a person loses permanently an ability to recall his recent memories. Dumbness - the alcoholic loses his cognitive abilities and just becomes kind of a drunk stupid plant.

What do you think about this classification? Is it better than DSM-V's AUD Disorder explained? Or DSM-IV's  distinction between abuse and dependence? Maybe, this model explains only part of the things? What are the flaws, in your opinion? Feel free to participate.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975486397743225}"

Hey guys,
 
Just looking for some advice about my alcoholic mother in law. So my bf and I have been forever for a little over a year . We love each other a lot and have been through more than we could have ever imagined during this pandemic and so many other events that unraveled over the last few months.

I’ve heard many passive aggressive comments about his mother and her erratic behavior from other family members (they call her “crazy” all the time) but have yet to meet her because of quarantine restrictions and the fact that she is currently living out of state. 

I never liked that they made these comments as I don’t think it’s anyone place to make rude comments about parents who are addicts or have issues in front of their kids. So I never liked that they did this in front of me or him before I even met her ... they’ve also encouraged him to stop all communication with her , as he’s suffered some rough times (picking her up as a child from bars because she was too drunk and never came home , things like this
)  and other things that I don’t know if he’s 100% comfortable yet or just not interested in reliving those moments to tell me 

Flash forward a few months and I began talking to his mother almost every day via text because of some situations in which I needed to contact her . She’s a sweet person but I can tell now why the rest of
The family doesn’t want him to have involvement with her .

She often texts me and I can tell by the content of the messages that she is drunk. My bf will get an abundance of calls back to back followed by sometimes up to 10+ messages about how his father is no longer into her and only wants her for sex (they’re divorced). All sorts of depressing things that I’m sure he’s had to hear and deal with since childhood.

She often gaslights us by sending us texts about how she can’t live anymore etc. and has a lot of debt (almost 50,000 +)

My boyfriend Is about to get some money and I think she’s expecting him to pay it . He wanted to at first but we’ve been thinking and she’s been on the same path for years despite many chances and warnings from my bf about getting help and the fact that the rest of the family is putting pressure On him to not speak to her .

I feel bad ... but with the way she gaslights me and ive only been on direct contact with her for maybe 2 months just makes me sad for my bf. He’s kind and loves her but she keeps putting him in bad situations and only thinking of herself. She often runs back and forth between he and his father, with drama. They use him as a pawn when they fight and often tries to make him look like he’s chosen sides.

I even think she’s purposefully tried to sprain her ankle to get a response out of my bf after she called him a million times to talk about her financial problems and he didn’t respond . 

How do I go about telling him that it’s time to make serious boundaries? 

I don’t want to be circling the same drain forever or dealing with drama forever . She now wants to move with us and says she misses us though she’s never met me . I don’t want someone coming in and putting more on my shoulders than I can already take.

2020-11-06 20:19:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jphqou/hello_my_rantventtherapy_post/,"Hello, my rant/vent/therapy post","Hello, it is midnight here and english is not my first language so i apologize for any grammatical and spelling mistakes. This is my rant/vent/therapy post, that i have wanted to write for a long time. My father is an alcoholic, has been for the last 45 years, he is 72 years old now. And i am a bad person, because for the last 3 years, i have done nothing but wish for him to die. I know how that sounds, but i can not live with him and his alcoholism anymore.

My firs clear memory about his problem is from when i was 3 years old, and he needed to go to the hospital, because he was puking blood. I have not seen that (thank god), but i remember my mother siting on the bed crying and cursing alcohol and me asking what is wrong and trying to comfort her. Everybody  thought  that he would die, but after 2 weeks in the ICU he got thru. He was 42 at that time. I later found out that he first went in to rehab at 30 after his father died.

After he got from the hospital he was sober for some  years, maybe 3 i am not sure . I do not remember him being drunk, just him sleeping it off. But i do remember how bad he got when he stop drinking, he always got a mystery back pain, that would be gone in 3 days, and then he would be sober for a couple of months. The older he got the bigger his problem got and the less he cared for his family. we always had to be there for him, but he was never there for us.

His drinking got seriously bad after my mother died 15 years ago. It has gotten so bad that he needed to go to a hospital, he stayed there for a month and a half, and he would not speak, to me or my brother for 2 weeks, in his head we wore the mean ones, because we took his alcohol away. And we couldn't possibly understand that the love of his live died. No i could not understand that, i was just dealing with my mothers death at 20 years of age. And an alcoholic father, university and running of our goat farm. So nothing big, or live chancing. So he had gotten sober again and joined a local AA club. He was sober for maybe 4 years.

But his  constant drinking and smoking and not taking care of himself, left a mark, he has hart issues and he is on blood thinners, from smoking he has COPD, and he has diabetes. So now when his drinking gets really bad, he starts to retain water and gets pneumonia. So back to the hospital we go, once or twice a year. And that was  somehow fine until 5 years ago when my brother suddenly died, and the story repeated, he again lost something that i could never understand and was again mean for taking him to the hospital.

in the next 2 years he found any excuse he could for drinking, from me being meant to him, to me not talking to him, me and my husband not understanding how depress he is, to him selling his last tractor from the farm,... my husband is a doctor, so i think you could imagine that he got the best possible care he could.  And we really thought that he finally wants to get better, so my husband puled a lot of strings and got him to see a specials that deals with old alcoholic, and to get him in to rehab. He promised that he would do all that, that he really wants to get better, but first he needed to go to the hospital for pneumonia. Long story short he did not go to rehab or to see the psychiatrist in his words: ""i lied"". After that my husband sad that he will never call in favors for him again. He had had  enough, and so did i. Time after time we wore all there for him, encouraging and supporting and it changed nothing.

The last 3 years were bad he was in the hospital 2 times for bleeding, both times in the ICU for a couple of days and than in the regular room for 3 weeks, they get him sober, and in about a month, he started drinking again. Last time he was in a hospital was in march of this year.

And now we are here at the end at least i think is the end. It took me two hours to write this, and i can not sleep, because i am waiting. Somebody was drinking again, a lot, on the 31 of October he was pass out drunk at noon. On  November first he drank a whole bottle of gin. He does not want to go to the hospital, and i am past the point of arguing with him. I can not do it any more. You can not help a person who dose not want to to help themselves. I tried and failed. So now i am waiting. I think he is dying. And after so many years of watching him choosing alcohol over his family, i think i will let him fulfill his live ambition of drinking one self to death.

I am sorry if this story upsets anyone, i did not write it (badly, again i apologize for the mistakes) for that purpose. I wrote it so it my change someones mind. I hope that if you are struggling whether to pick that bottle or not, that you see this, and think: 'i never want my children to think that of me'.

And i still do not feel better...

EDIT: I've asked my husband to write an update for you. As we suspected, this was my father's last binge. He passed away peacefully in his sleep, it seems. We saw the TV turn off and his night light switch on around 11 pm, and we found him dead in his bed this morning when I went  to ask him if he needed anything. 

I feel sad, but mostly I feel relieved. After years of emotional abuse and blaming me for his problems, I feel like a weight has been lifted. I'm glad he died in his sleep without suffering and truly believe he is now at peace. After everything he put me through, he was still my father and the last surviving member of my immediate family and I will miss him, but as far as I'm concerned, he had been gone from my life for more than 5 years. My husband reminded me that he almost missed our wedding due to drinking (we had to check him out of the hospital for a day after he had been admitted for pneumonia after one of his binges).  

Thank you for the kind words and advice. We have tried in the past to get him to see a psychiatrist, and the local AA chapter had a psychologist that offered to help, but he always promised to go when the shakes started and refused as soon as he detoxed. The last time we called his AA friends for help he called me a b\*tch for getting him demoted from group leader/sponsor (I don't know the correct term) and snitching on him to AA. He never acknowledged his own hypocrisy in the matter. He refused medical help right until yesterday evening when I last saw him alive. 

Alcoholism truly is a terrible disease and he fought it unsuccessfully until the very end. I hope he is in a better place now. We've notified his friends and extended family and asked them to donate to his local AA chapter or hospital in lieu of flowers. They've done more for him in the past 15 years than I ever could and for that I am grateful.

I've tried talking to him about my mom and why their relationship has strained but he never answers it(which also affected me relationship wise). He's get pretty angry sometimes when he's on alcohol and starts shouting about whatever is going through his mind atm.  
Because of all this, I started smoking weed when I started my  bachelor's degree. I opened up to my dad about my smoking habit, and how it helps me. Smoking weed calms my head and let's me concentrate on what I'm doing.  
This also leaves me in doubt if I can go out and do masters degree. I know for sure that I can't leave my mom alone in this house and go somewhere else.  
Please share if you guys have gone through something similar and maybe your experiences can give me ideas on what I can do.

Pretty much always beer, but pretty consistently, started with a few beers at night, turned into a lot of beers at night until I passed out, then turned into day drinking to keep the shakes away and again heavily at night until I passed out basically. Well, I say night...it's more like the morning as I work graveyard shifts and usually get home around 4 or 5 am. As you might imagine, there isn't a whole lot to do after work getting home when most the rest of everyone is asleep. So I pretty much got into a pattern of playing video games and drinking til i couldn't really focus on the screen and eventually passed out..



It really escalated in the last 2 years or so, I would spend close to 30 dollars a day on beer, usually a 6 pack throughout the day and then I'd get home and drink a couple 22 ounce beers and usually put a dent into another 6 pack. (I should mention i usually sprung for craft beers which is why it cost so much) I always felt sickly to some degree and drinking seemed to help, but of course was also the cause. I would occasionally drink too much or too quickly, convincing myself for whatever reason that before I go and do something else, something as simple as leave the room to go smoke, I should finish the beer I'm working on which would often cause me to throw up. I don't think I even realized how often it was happening. It got to the point where I wasn't really getting hangovers so much as withdrawals. If I didn't have a beer right after waking up I would have pretty bad shakes and often throw up, sometimes even if I did have a beer, or again if I drank it too fast.


I had almost no appetite for the last few months, sometimes just putting food in my mouth would cause me to gag and sometimes vomit. I lost close to 20 pounds, sometimes only eating once every 2 or 3 days. I would feel hungry but I couldn't stomach food and so I just drank more beer which I guess the carbs filled me up to some degree. I was a mess, my room was a disaster filled with empty bottles that I always told myself ""ahh...I'll clean it up tomorrow"" Needless to say, I never did. I was stuck in this endless loop, I felt trapped and ashamed, but I just kept drinking. It became a requirement just to feel normal. If I didn't have an extra beer or two laying around after waking up my first instinct was to head to the corner store for more beer. Sometimes I was trembling so bad I could barely get my debit card into the slot. It was embarrassing and I have to imagine the clerk noticed but no one ever said anything.


I had completely lost control, I'd wake up confused wondering if it was day or night, if the dream i had really happened or not, if what I did in real life the day before really happened or if I forgot to do it or if it was supposed to happen today. It's hard to explain, I don't know if that makes sense to anyone.


All this is to say that last Sunday I woke up, felt very nauseous and vomited up  the absolute worst tasting straight up black stuff, like coffee grounds almost, it was nothing like had ever happened before. My immediate thought was, ""uh oh"" but I tried to rationalize it as like maybe I ate something weird (I hadn't eaten in days tho) or my body was expelling toxins or just kinda grabbing at straws to try and convince myself nothing was wrong and I went back to bed. I don't really think I actually got back to sleep, just kinda these micro dreams and going between feeling too hot and sweating then feeling too cold and back and forth. About two hours later I rolled onto my back and with very little warning vomited again, quite violently. This time it was a mix of black stuff and dark red blood. That's when I knew something was very very wrong and there was no rationalizing it, this was bad.


Obviously, I was scared as hell. My girlfriend was awake and outside, I went to her, trembling partly from terror and I'm sure partly because I hadn't drank anything yet, and told her what had happened and that ""i uh.....I think we should go to the hospital"". She went upstairs and saw the bloody mess on my sheets and floor (sorry this story is kinda graphic I know) We immediately went to the E.R. By the time the first doctor saw me I was sweating through my clothes and white as a ghost. I explained what happened and was pretty quick to tell him that ""I'm....pretty much a full blown alcoholic"" I'm glad I was honest. (Side note: DEFINITELY BE HONEST IF YOU SEE A DOCTOR, you have nothing to lose, they are not going to judge you, they are there to help!) So they noticed the trembling right away and I was pretty quickly hooked up to fluids, but they weren't 100 percent sure what caused the bloody vomit.


This part is kind of a blur, but I was fairly quickly wheelchaired from the E.R. into the actual hospital hospital (I'm not sure exactly what you would call it) and put into another room where more tests were done, honestly I can't remember all that went on. It was pretty obvious though that I would need to stay overnight so I was wheeled into a more permanent room (again I wish I knew all the terms here, sorry) And was hooked up to a couple IVs, one was for fluids the other was for the withdrawals. I think I was given a few different pills as well. This all happened between like 10 am to about 4 pm. I pretty much just slept the rest of that day.


I'll try and wrap up the hospital experience here, I ended up spending 4 days in the hospital, they figured out after being anesthetized and a thing put down my throat that I had a large tear in my esophagus. They fixed that on the second day and I spent the next two days on a combination of drugs to deal with the withdrawals (without professional help and monitoring withdrawals can get so bad they can cause seizures and all sorts of bad stuff, but I'm sure most of you guys know that) I'm so grateful for the care I received and they hooked me up with an outpatient program for meetings and all that which I start on the 9th. Those 4 days in the hospital were the first time I had been sober for more than a day in like 8 or 9 years. It took a scary as hell experience and 4 days in the hospital but I've now been sober for just about 10 days! It doesn't sound like much but it's a huge deal for me, and honestly I haven't felt this good in as long as I can remember. My appetite is back in a big way, I can't tell you how amazing it feels to enjoy food again. This has changed my life for the better and if this whole fiasco didn't happen I'd still be drinking myself to death I'm sure.


If you've made it this far into my story, thank you so much for hearing me out. I just wanted to share my experience and also encourage anyone struggling out there to seek help before it gets this bad. Some people will definitely need more than just meetings to quit, you may need medical supervision if your withdrawals were as bad as mine, it can be very dangerous to go it alone and there are drugs that can help and there are doctors that can help put you on track. Take that first step, don't put it off like I did. In a lot of ways, sounds kinda weird, but I'm glad I tore my esophagus and I'm super glad there were doctors to help. I was too embarrassed before and now I realize that was just in my head. Please know that you can get help and there's no shame in it. If you're an alcoholic you have a disease. Doctors treat diseases, no one in the medical field will judge or shame you, even if some of the people in your personal life do (and frankly you'll probably be surprised how supportive those people will be once you do take that first step)

So, here's to another 10 days! And another and another, one step at a time but right now I'm feeling super confident and I'm genuinely surprised at how good i feel. I still get some shakes but I'm taking gabapentin during the day and trazodone at night and I couldn't get through this without it. 


You are loved. You deserve to feel better. Take that first step, you'll be so glad you did. It won't be easy, but you're stronger than you know. 


Tl;dr: It took a hole in my esophagus and vomiting blood to get me into a hospital where I got the treatment I needed for my alcoholism, 10 days into sobriety and I'm feeling like a new me and I'm determined to keep it up.

Also I've never been on this sub before and I'm not sure what is appropriate so if this isn't then please remove it! Also this is going to be kinda long. Some backstory- I'm Mason, 25, and I know alcoholism and addictive personality runs in the family. The past year has been incredibly hard for me, as it has for everyone, and the hits just keep on coming. I started living alone for the first time a little over a year ago and I love it, but the freedom it affords also means there is no one to check me when my coping mechanisms become self-destructive or I make any other questionable decisions. 

I've found myself turning to drinking a lot more often when I'm upset than I used to. I'm not sure if it is because I used to have more people in my support system than I do now and I like distractions, or if the little addiction switch in my brain turned on at age 24 because one day this past year I looked up and suddenly found myself helplessly addicted to sugar and sodas as well, which I know is very different but still something I'm struggling with. I've looked back and realized that the times I've been at my lowest have also coincided with me getting my most drunk, and also that it only happens when I'm alone (when I'm drinking to cope anyway.) Its close to impossible for me to black out, so that happens extremely rarely, and I hardly ever throw up or have a hangover because my family is blessed with genetics that are amazing at handling alcohol and also gives us all addictive personalities and predilections for drinking, so that's obviously a great combo. So I don't really feel any ~repercussions~ when I sit at home and get shitfaced alone to dull my pain, and I think that is part of the problem. 

But mainly my question regards this. When I am happy, with my friends, having fun, I never feel like my drinking is unhealthy. I am doing it because I'm having fun and enjoying it, not because I feel the need to or because I'm trying to use it to cope. It makes me fun, and makes it easier for me to interact with people at the parties I go to where I don't know anyone. Drunk Mason can make friends with anyone, and is the life of the party, and doesn't puke, and sings and dances and jokes and makes friends and wakes up early without a hangover and makes a bomb ass breakfast. And I genuinely love that Mason. It's one of my favorite versions of me. Thinking about going to parties and nursing a juice or something makes me so sad. This is the time when it's easy for me to party, and it doesn't make me feel like shit physically like I know I will when I'm older, and it's my favorite way to meet new people and make new friends, which is something I haven't always been good at. I really don't want to give up drinking because of that.

But, and this is something I haven't said out loud before, my drinking habits when I'm alone and upset scare me. My mom quit cold turkey when she found out I was pregnant with me, hasn't had a drink in over 25 years, and won't let me bring jack Daniel's in the house because it still triggers her addiction in a way she doesn't feel strong enough to fight. My grandma ""doesn't have a problem"" but drinks a bottle of wine while she makes dinner every day and opens a new one to have with the meal. I watched my dad break all the bones in his fingers on a tree when I was a kid because he was drunk and got mad that I forgot to put the lid back on the peanut butter. I don't ever want to be like that. And just tonight, on the eve of the election while I'm struggling to not slip into a panic attack, I sat on the floor nearly tearing my hair out staring at a bottle of whiskey and crying and telling myself not to, when 2 days ago on Halloween knocking back a 12 pack made me the life of the party and I made so many new friends. I've always been able to talk to my parents about anything but I don't feel like I can go to them about this because it makes my mom so sad to think about me struggling in the same way as her and my dad, and she is already so worried about me when I drink I think it would break her heart to find out she actually had reason to worry. 

I guess I'm not entirely sure what my question is. Alcoholic is a really scary word to me because of my family. I'm not sure I'd be able to admit it, or say it out loud. But as I sat here on the verge of a panic attack and all of a sudden heard myself speaking out loud, telling myself over and over again not to open that bottle, that I was strong enough to get through this sober,  I know that I have a problem. I just don't understand how the Mason who is the life of the party and the absolute man when I happy drink can possibly turn around and send myself into a dark hazy stupor to numb the pain 2 days later. And I don't know how to combat that problem because I genuinely love the social drinking. I guess I just need advice on what to do about it, and if my alone time drinking is a bad enough, unhealthy enough thing to take away my happy fun time party drinking. Or maybe I just need someone to read this and understand, or tell me nice encouraging words. Thank you so much for reading, if you're still here after that completely novel I just composed.

Stories of people who figured out a system in their lives - to still enjoy but not go overboard.

2020-11-02 08:08:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jmn32j/negative_alcoholic_and_coke_enthusiast/,Negative alcoholic and coke enthusiast friend/roomate,"Hi everyone, 

I live with one of my best friends. I moved in with him last year because his mom kicked him out for being disrepectful towards her (this was already a red flag but the nice guy I am wanted to help him out). So at first, everything was good but after a while, I realised he had really bad mood swings for no apparent reasons (he pretty much woke up mad and would slam doors over petty things or do other childish stuff like that). I would talk to him about it and he would just tell me how his life sucked and that everything is always worse for him (he's a really negative person and he complains alot about not having women in his life but he doesn't do anything to change and doesn't listen to advices). 

So, he's got a drinking problem, at first I didn't mind it too much because when I was younger, we used to drink alot more (we're in our late 20s now). Thing is he drinks everyday. Sometimes I wake up on a week day, he is there being loud not caring about a thing, falling on the ground or talking very loud on the phone with a friend. I talked to him about it when he's sober, he would aknowledge the problem and be sorry, but he keeps doing it still, he doesn't wanna change.

Like I mentioned earlier, he's also got issues with women. He's never dated a girl (29 years old now), and he says that every little thing that happens in his life is worse for him because he never had a girlfriend, and that he tries but it doesn't work out (I'm kind of sceptical that he tries hard). He's depressed because of this and constantly says that he's just the unluckiest guy in the whole world and that his life sucks. I tried helping him at first saying he should try losing a bit of weight, that women would maybe find him a little bit more attractive, he's 5'6"" ± 250lbs, pretty much obese. He said he would but he's eating junkfood almost every meal and drinking almost everyday. He did get a one time date with a girl, but since he's got no experience dating (which she probably realized) she was getting distant with him, and then he would get very mad about it and text her that she's wasting his time pretty much.

When he's drunk he also likes to do coke. He sees it as no big deal, but everyone who does coke think they can stop whenever they want to, and then, get drunk and do coke again, and so it goes... He doesn't do some often though, maybe once or twice a month when he's really drunk or with friends who do coke.

I tried helping in many ways, giving him advices (especially about women and health) but he doesn't really listen to me much from what I see, he nods but doesn't change a thing and continues on with his old ways. I found him a job where I work. At first, he was happy but now he keeps complaining about how it sucks, I told him to get another one but he says that there are no other jobs (lol ok). 

Sorry for the long paragraphs, but I wanted you to get the portrait. What I wanna know from you guys is, how do I confront him ? How do I make him realize how he's the one digging the hole deeper and that it's not the world that is against him. Maybe this sub is not the right one for a question like this, but I figured out that you might know. Thanks for your help.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978501796722412}"

I remember him drinking at all my sports games as a kid he’d sneak alcohol in water bottles so no one would notice, and seeing him drunk at home and on vacation. No child should have to see that.

He called me cancer when I was 15, he said I was toxic. He didn’t even talk to me for a year after that.

Once we went to Europe and while he was drinking all night and morning at the bar I was alone puking in the hotel room. I had eaten some food that didn’t agree with my stomach and so I kept throwing up. I had to force feed myself water all night just so I could throw up. I remember how helpless I felt. When he did come back at 10/11 am he said “ you’re a big girl you can handle it” after I told him about it. All I wanted was for him to have at least been there :(

Please don’t drink, I beg you. I’m in so much pain. 

I have everything I could ever want. I go on foreign vacations and get expensive presents. But all I want is my dad back.

After the wedding, I was gonna leave and she had asked me to stay and spend some time with her. So I promised to come back.. and I didn’t. Instead I fell asleep because I was too hungover to do anything else. 
I’ve noticed thats a thing I do often.. I make plans and promises I don’t keep because I end up fucked up. I’m literally so irresponsible sometimes and it’s always due to wanting to drink instead.

I remember the first time I got drunk like it was yesterday I was 16 and had 2 or 3 beers . I immediately thought wow this is the answer I was looking for . At that point I had taken so many different medications to help me focus in school or feel less anxious . Alcohol fixed those things for me in a matter of 30 minutes and it only took drinking a liquid . I began to drink more and more whenever I could for the next  5 years with a small break of 3 months somewhere in-between. When I was 17 I got very drunk one day drank a 26er of whiskey and blacked out . I woke up in a hospital . Apparently I was found at a church and could of died of hypothermia . That should of been my wake up call I feel but it wasn't enough to make me realise I couldn't drink responsibly some how . 

Recently however was my real wake up call . I broke up with my girl friend of three years . Alcohol wasn't necessarily the problem but it was probably a factor along with our distance and covid not helping . I was in so much pain and had finally realised how horrible of a person I had been to so many people in my life because of alcohol and self medicating to treat my mental illness . I decided I was going to have one last bender to go out with a bang . That bender ended with me at a bridge contemplating jumping off . I entered a treatment facility and have been sober for 6 months now . It got to the point where I was making home made grape juice wine in my closet and drinking bottles of it so I could afford some cheap form of liquor . There would be mornings when my roommates would carry me and drop me in the shower because I was so hung over I couldn't move . 

Sobriety has brought me clarity and that's not something I thought I would hate . I can't move on with my life without being held accountable for who I was during those 5 years . I just don't know where to start I feel like I need help . I know that's what AA is for and I've been trying to pursue it but its hard during covid to find a group that I feel I fit with that is in person . I've also been feeling suicidal for months now I feel like alcohol was always the answer for me when I didn't know what to do but now I don't have that answer and it's hard to live without it .

I try to only drink on weekends but fail on Wednesday always. I have about two bottles of wine on that day and around 50-60 units on weekend. The urge is so strong to drink that I always cave in. Im 28 and doing a Masters Degree, I play rugby, go to the gym, run and so it hasn't massively impacted any of that too much but most of the time I only just get away with it. 

I don't want to give up drinking all together as I genuinely enjoy it most of the time, I just want to stop drinking on my own (normally i listen to music and play games). I want to drink with my friends and that should be the only occasion. On weekends I feel I almost have to drink cos its the weekend but hate feeling hungover on Sunday (I have such bad anxiety from drinking), yet this still does not stop me drinking. 

I just want to know if anyone has had the same kind of pattern as me and if there are tips out there to help with the urges.

2020-11-01 01:53:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jlxkbd/just_wanted_to_vent/,Just wanted to vent,"I've been on and off problem drinking for something like nine years (I am turning 31 in a week). It's worse at times and better at times. I've been in my better period in 2020 for drinking. Done AA, therapy, medications, HSM, the whole lot. I've suffered from diagnosed low grade depression, anxiety and avoidant personality disorder for that same nine year period, currently untreated in terms of therapy or medications, but for which I've had tried treatments in the past.

Anyway so last week I had a mental breakdown. I have mental breakdowns every few months. I think what triggered it this time was taking a week off from running. Running is my substitute addiction for drinking, but I had physical and mental burnout after running 800 km (or 497 miles in freedom units) in eight weeks. This has happened before, after I completed my first marathon and fell into a suicidal depression. Exercise is known to amplify mental health problems when it's done at a higher intensity and level. 

Without exercise to counter my depression I fell into suicidality again. And so I started drinking heavily, and binged two bottles of gin and a whole bunch of wine and beer over the course of four days, plus benzos. Texted my mum angrily with my antinatalist beliefs saying I wish she had never brought me into existence etc. Took a day off work to drink in the morning. 

Anyway that binge leveled my head out a bit and I'm back to normal. Normal being drink a couple of times a week, mostly on the weekends. I did go to one SMART Zoom meeting which probably didn't help but to a very mild extent. 

You might say that alcohol caused me to be depressed and anxious, but that's not true. I have always felt like this throughout high school, even though I wasn't drinking at all. I was an invisible loner, and really I'm still a loner to this day. I struggle with loneliness a lot, and alcohol helps with that. The reason I can't stop is because of these feelings of being alone. No matter how much I try. I've organised Reddit meet ups in the past (even as recently as organising one last week) and tried to get out there socially, but none of this has resulted in me clicking with anyone. Even when I do click with people (from work or whatever) I find it hard to get close to them. And there's an inevitable drift apart. 

I also don't see the point of being sober when the world is going to shit. We're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction, runaway climate change is happening as we speak. Bushfires and drought is bad now and will only get worse as time goes on. There's an economic depression which will only get worse with ecological collapse. The terrible thing is that either people are ignorant of this reality, or they don't care, or are willfully blind, or like to believe technology will save us (a form of wilful blindness).

Politics has never been worse in terms of intergenerational equality, continuing decisions to not act on climate change and trash the environment (eg they approved the destruction of koala habitat to expand a local quarry). Political decisions ensure the rich get richer, while my partner hasn't been able to find a job despite having a PhD. He's thinking that going back to school to get a degree in education and becoming a high school teacher may be the only way out for him. My sister's partner had to go that route, because there's no jobs in science in Australia. 

I have been involved in climate activism but found it's not for me, I don't fit in with these groups. Plus any activism they could do this year has been fettered by COVID-19 health orders. So they've basically given up this year, which is sad. Not that it matters because activism hasn't changed anything and it never will. The powers that be are just too powerful, and the problems too complex and interconnected.

I honestly do wish I had never been born into this burning planet full of suffering and misery, though I know it's pointless to cry over spilt milk. I just wish I had more close real life friends to commiserate with, as that might take the edge of facing the doom. Because I have these sorts of feelings, I just don't fit into mainstream groups like AA and such, who tend to be happily ignorant of such things or don't want to think about it. 

I guess I'm not ready yet to give up the alcohol, although one day I may come to that point. The best I can strive for is to hopefully come to a place of moderation, or very rare binges once in a while. It's been worse in the past, in that alcohol was the only thing I could think of and craved, so I guess I'm not in the worst place right now. I have plenty of scope to change.
