I had been attending a PHP for about 3 weeks, and was just booted because I don't have a medical marijuana card. Now. I have the appointment, qualifying conditions, have had a card in the past, and even paid but they are booked out til October 26 to see me. 

There are several other members in PHP who do have a card, and were no questioned about their usage of marijuana or even nyquil.

Alcohol was my life. Started out innocently enough, drinking on the weekends 1 or two nights through college, graduated to 2 nights every weekend and then before I knew it it was every weekend night and a few times through the week. Sometimes I'd struggle being able to drink enough after / during a binge to get drunk - but I always managed to anyway :)

I was sick of watching my life pass by, the years and then decades spending a good chunk of my time drunk. Disappointing those who loved me and setting a horrible example as a father. I tried to quit a couple of times. I'd always go back to being a ""moderate"" drinker (hahaha). Never worked for me, same as with weed, I'd always end up back to where I left off and usually even worse - like I was making up for lost time.

I didn't even know my last drink was my last drink when I was drinking it. It was the day after I believe that I decided, that was enough and I never looked back. I started exercising and doing my best to look after my health. I (continued) smoking weed for the first few years. I think they call that California sober now... but I definitely wasn't sober. Off weed now too for well over a year.

If I could describe my sober life now in comparison to my addicted life the word peaceful comes to mind. There is so much more peace in my life without substances controlling me.",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8910706639289856}"

Chronic relapser here.... Been trying to quit or moderate for a long time now... Over 15 years.

Currently on day 2 on my latest attempt.

I've also been using various substances ""recreationly"" - marijuana, coke, MDMA, ecstacy and more than likely have a horrendous relationship with sex. I use all these things to distract and alter how I feel. With the caveat that ""alcohol is my problem, nothing else."", but that's not true. I use these substances exactly the way I use alcohol, to excess and often. The only difference is that I don't behave as abhorrently as I do when I'm drunk or drinking.

I've also found that additional use of the substances listed above eventually leads to an alcohol relapse. The thought process goes, ""well I'm already not sober from my drug use, and I don't currently have access to those drugs, so what's the harm in drinking?"".

The harm is drunk driving. As I did last weekend. Missing work, as I did on Monday. Worrying my family as I have all week. Missing or neglecting my responsibilities as a friend and human being. And being absolutely wrecked physically and mentally. Sweats. Cramps. Headaches. Vomiting. Suicidal thoughts.

I always thought a life based on relentless honesty was impossible. That everyone lies and manipulates.... But I think I'm starting to realise that relentless honest starts with myself.


This feeling may pass. I may slip back into complacency and find myself here again. On another day 2. Sweet jesus I hope not. This is awful. 

Just for today friends - I will not drink with you.

I had just trained on my own online for a new career and broke into the field with a great new job at an architecture firm.   But the one month hard suspension of my license by bmv made it so I had to give up my job or get fired. There was no possible exception to get, so the four week suspension ruined my life. Why would another firm give me a chance if I failed six months into my new career? I went all in on this new thing by believing in myself and committing to it and now it’s over before it started. I have borderline personality disorder and complex trauma, so it was already a huge task to put myself through this training and switch careers.   At this point I feel like my society doesn’t care what happens to me either so why on earth should I? I’m going to be caught up until at least next year (maybe the following year?!) before I even get to put in a plea in front of a judge. I have been chronically suicidal for months before this happened, but obviously that won’t be considered since they’re just looking to enforce some punishment. I probably won’t go to jail but I lost everything I’ve worked for and don’t see why I shouldn’t just blow my brains out.   I say this in a very calm way from a scary calm place which is why it freaks me out. I’m not like having a breakdown or out of control but yeah my life is basically over career wise and that is all our society values us for so why should I give a fuck?

So I am , like the title says, a crippling alcoholic. I made the lifestyle choice to give up alcohol around 100 days ago and have managed to stay sober. I didn't get sober because I wanted to, I got sober because I physically needed to. The physical symptoms of severe anxiety/panic attacks and debilitating GI problems forced me to give up the bottle.

I had an upper endoscopy done with no gastritis and nothing significant found. I am having a gastric emptying study and a colonoscopy done in the coming month or two. I am still dealing with some anxiety and discomfort but nothing compared to what it once was. The biggest issue for me is my abdomen. It is still pretty bloated or feels that way, I have indigestion, constipation, and gas. Everything is irregular and feels so uncomfortable. I am in my early twenties and was not an alcoholic for too long but I went hard. It isn't pancreatitis, liver disease, anything like that, but I was wondering if anyone else dealt with seemingly IBS symptoms after going sober and for how long they lasted and what has helped.

I’m 28(F) currently working and going to school.

I have been through a same as anybody. Meaning to say; I’ve had a long hard road to be a productive member of society— and I’m far from there yet. Family without support. Educational and emotional neglect. Etc..

Recently I’ve realized how dependent I am on alcohol to cope with these things. I don’t feel like “myself” without several hard drinks and I hate that. I used to be so happy without a single drink. Now I feel like I’m just waiting for the next one. Without it, my anxiety is unbearable.

I’ve tried medication and had terrifying mental side effects. At the same time, I hated how badly the medication made me more sensitive to alcohol. What an ironic double down.

I do not want to rely on drinks to feel comfortable. I do not want to rely on alcohol to feel like I can “be myself.”
I’m not entirely sure how I got here, but I did.

I’m fine with taking responsibility. I just struggle with how much of the concept of taking responsibility seems to often lack compassion. In my personal experience.

I had a very strange childhood. Had very many “disadvantages.” And while I’m not trying to play pure victim, I’m also not willing to accept pure villain.

All things considered I have made out pretty good for myself. Got into school, find my own jobs, pay my rent— just struggling hard to accept the idea of nobody else in my personal life caring if I struggle but only wanting to know about “better.”

It’s been this way for years, long before alcohol came into the picture. After trying so hard for so long met with only resentment I had that “wtf” feeling and now I’m just sabotaging myself.

I’ll wrap it up here since I know it is only a rant. Suffice it to say I do want to bet better. I don’t like relying on alcohol. If for nothing else than the physical side effects. But truth is I feel so alone. At this point I just struggle to know that anybody actually cares if I do better, or if they’re just waiting for that “I told you so” moment.

Sometimes daily, then I’ll switch to a couple times a week and then every other day and back to daily.  Sometimes I have a lot and sometimes I just have a few beers but I always crave it.  

I feel like I can’t enjoy anything without having a buzz even though I know it isn’t true.  I do the same stuff and have the same hobbies whether I am drunk or sober and the only thing that changes is I fall asleep sooner.  

I even started taking antidepressants which has helped a lot but even though I have cut down on it I still end up drinking a couple times a week.  I know it interacts with my medication and inevitably makes me in a worse mood sometimes for days afterwards and I still do it anyways.  

Working out helps me deal with it. Usually, on the days I hit the gym and workout I can kind of get by with the natural high I get from it but I can’t always do that and even when I have the free time, I can’t workout every single day because I need recovery days.  So on my rest days, that is usually when the craving hits me the hardest and even though I know it’s only going to make everything worse, I normally cave and go buy some and then hours later regret it.  Nothing was better and it did not enhance or improve anything at all.  

I don’t even want it anymore I think at this point after 16 years of putting it into my body off and on I am physically addicted to it.  I need some help on quitting for good.  I think I’m past the stage of trying to just drink in moderation, I realize now that I have a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

We tried to do everything - talked to him, smashed the bottles, poured the drinks right down the sink, and always frisked his pockets every time he would come home from outside. 

He refuses to go in any alcoholism recovery group. Heck, he doesn't even acknowledge that he has got a problem. He always downplays our concerns and says he is doing just fine because he can control his senses when he's drunk and apparently that means nothing is wrong with drinking more. 

He drinks during work, in the night, even outside in secret. 

This has gone far too long and it has come to this. Even now, he is refusing to take a sonography or even ready to see a doctor. 

Even after he was diagnosed with liver stiffness, we still caught him with a bottle.

Relapsed at Halloween. Got Hepatitis from contaminated food. That kept me out of the gym. As soon as it healed I began drinking again in January of 2021 and at Christmas. Again, this is all killing my health because I already drank so much for so long. 

Spiraled out of control in May/June of this year. Beer at noon and watch movies until I was tired or passed out. Finally stopped drinking for a little. Vacation comes and I drink a lot, but no real big issues (besides health) as everyone was drinking. As soon as I got back, zero alcohol zero fapping zero smoking. 

Went home beginning of this month. Spiraled out again. Lost money, began smoking began drinking began fapping. 

Got so bad that I was hammering beers and eating pizza and snorting amphetamines one night. That woke me up bad, in the way that you just stand outside your own body and go, “what the fuck are you even doing”.

Obviously I love my husband very much but this week has been turmoil for me, full of hysterics and crying. He says it’s about “control” but of course it’s the alcohol. All he wants to do his drink, and he didn’t for over a year. Suddenly now he’s super angry, has been treating me terrible, and says he’s going to leave me if he can’t drink or smoke. Of course I don’t want him to since he has a problem.

He’s made me cave to the point of crying and begging him to stay, and agreeing to his terms. But we argue about it because that’s not what I want and I can’t understand why it’s contingent on alcohol. I keep telling him it’s fucked up but he doesn’t care.


I don’t know what about me is allowing him to treat me this way and stay. I love him and want to be happy in a marriage together so badly. I don’t know why I’m staying.

I just had to share this cause I’m ridiculously proud of myself and never once saw this happening in over a decade.

Today I picked up my paycheck. It was totally wrong. My work screwed up my hours and pay which resulted in a loss of hundreds of dollars. Now I need to wait til next week for it to be corrected. 
Normally (and anyone who knows me could tell you just how true this is), this would lead me to the closest bar to pound some shots and black out on my way home in an Uber. But instead, I stopped, thought, and decided to take myself somewhere peaceful for a quiet lunch. 

So then, I went to a restaurant to sit by the water. The only available seat in the whole place was 2 ft from the bar. I decided to take it anyways and reminded myself that I was there for the view. But there were swarms of wasps (around 30 of them) that were landing in people’s drinks, on their food and flying at them. Which made my anxiety go through the roof! Normally, I would’ve done a few shots and chased them with some beer to calm my nerves. Before making my way to the next spot to get hammered. Instead? I calmly asked for the check and left. 

Then I drove two hours to a store I wanted to go to just to find out that their hours online were wrong. Normally I’d find a bar nearby since I was out there and didn’t want to “waste a trip.” Instead, I told myself to breath and that bad things happen in 3s so the rest of my day should be great! Instead of turning those 3 things into larger problems by drinking, I went to the market and got stuff to cook a nice dinner to celebrate being sober for a whole week. 


And here I am! I have another meeting in a few hours but today was magical. Sure I faced a few minor inconveniences (that I would’ve let ruin my whole day when I was drinking), but instead of using that as an excuse to blame everyone, get reckless, and act out impulsively, I actually managed to do the right thing and stay sober. I feel alive and it’s freakin fantastic. The craziest part is that for years I’d secretly drink at the sign of the smallest problem especially if I was unsupervised and nobody would find out (well… til I came home and could barely make it through the door). 

I guess the reason I’m sharing this is cause sometimes it seems so easy to want to give up at the drop of a dime… But you CAN do it. Don’t sweat the small things. You’ve got this! Stay strong. 💕 Thank you for reading.",31,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9891006350517273}"

I started drinking heavily all over again, usually a bottle of whiskey or vodka 3 days per week alone in my room while playing PC games. Of course I ended up super depressed, very overweight, alone and over all just miserable. Later on I ended up having a seizure at Walmart in front of a bunch of people, pissed my pants and chipped some teeth. It was at that point I decided was fucking done with drinking. 

I had this bike I purchased on Amazon a couple of years prior and of course it just sat in my garage and collected dust.

I was getting withdrawals and drinking in the am at 19. I had 6 months clean and the constant cold sweaty feeling in my hands and feet got better along with the flu like feeling in my skin on my torso. I relapsed recently and I drink a lot. It was a 4 or 5 day bender give or take ending in hallucinations, possible seizures and a horrible detox needing medical help. After 2 days of detoxing in bed my girlfriend and father took me to the er for a medical detox. I was a 50 on the WAS scale after 6 months clean and only a 5 day bender. I should probably add I have also had a benzo detox but that was like 2 years ago and I am no longer dependent on benzos. I also detoxed off benzos one time and detoxed off alcohol probably 20 plus times building some bad alcoholic kindling. After getting shot after shot of valium in the er for 4 days I got stable and went ama cause they were pushing rehab. I’m home now and it’s back. My skin hurts the clothes hurt my body hair. My skin feels cold and flu like and it comes in waves. Warm showers help temporarily. My dad gives me his gabapentin sometimes and it helps as well. It’s mostly my feet, hands, chest and belly. As for my consumption, I drink dangerously large amounts. My detox before the 6 months clean I drank 6 pints of vodka in a night and my parents took my keys the next morning and made me detox. This lead to 6 months alcohol free the longest clean time I’ve had in years. As for this detox I’m not quite sure what I had. Ik it was a lot.

I met my friend about 3 years ago when he joined my fraternity. He’s a great kid, has had a few mental health/alcohol issues in the past, but nothing serious. At most, blacking out and doing dumb things, which is pretty common in a frat.

We returned for the fall semester about 4 weeks ago. The first couple weeks, he was isolating himself. He wouldn’t answer texts, he would lie about being busy or about where he was, and he wasn’t leaving his apartment. We thought it was solely a mental health issue. Three of us went to his apartment, and he was clearly drunk, and had empty bottles of liquor in his room. After talking, he wanted to go to the hospital, based on suicide ideation. 

He was in an inpatient program for about a week, by his parents’ decision. When he got out, he came back to campus. For the first week, there were no issues we were aware of. He would still be flakey and didn’t hang out with us much, but we thought he needed time to reflect on everything that happened. After he got out, we learned that a lot of his mental health issues are stemming from his parents’ divorce. We also learned that his mother is an alcoholic, and his dad is not the most responsible guy in the world (meeting him for the first time at a college tailgate 2 years ago, he got too drunk and started asking 20 year olds if they had cocaine).

Last night, he went missing. We tracked his location for a while, and found him sitting in a bush, obviously drunk. We took him back to his apartment, and talked for a while. He said that he has a somewhat bad relationship with alcohol, but that he believes he can get to a point where he can casually drink again. We agreed that he would take a break from drinking for a week, and he told us he had no alcohol in his room. I left, planning to go to his apartment the next day when he had class, so I could look to see if he had anything in his room.

He did not attend class today, at 11am. Instead, he was likely attending the class online, and drinking during it. His roommate took a shower, and when they were done, he was gone. We tracked his location, and found him behind an apartment building. He had a handle of vodka, which he had taken 7-8 shots of, and a bag of McDonalds. Next to where he was sitting, there was vomit, clearly from him.

We took him back to our friend’s apartment. We talked for a bit, keeping it somewhat casual. He went to take a shower, and I called his father. I explained the last 24 hours, and the father said he would pick him up, take him home, and enroll him in an outpatient/rehab program. When I returned from my call, he was out of the shower. 

I talked to him about getting better. He said that he knows he hasn’t been taking care of himself since he got out of the hospital, but he’s going to start. I asked him what the first step would be, and he said he would stop drinking for a while. I asked him if he believed that he could do that by himself, and he said yes, and said that today was bad enough that he realized he had to make a change. I directly told him that he said the same thing to me last night. I told him it was important to realize that he is not in control of his drinking. He was sitting down, not moving, but visibly got more upset & began crying.

He asked what he should do, and I told him that he needs to be around someone who loves him, cares about him, and can hold him accountable for staying away from alcohol. I asked about his dad, and he said they were supposed to meet tonight. I told him that his dad was coming to pick him up, which I knew would upset him, and he stopped talking entirely. After about 15 minutes, he began getting up, and grabbed his backpack. He said he was going to go back to his apartment and call his dad. I tried to stop him, but he said he wouldn’t do anything and that we had his location. He left, did go to his apartment, and waited until his dad picked him up. 

From my limited knowledge and experience, I believe he is an alcoholic. He has lied many times to stop people from finding out what he’s doing/how much he’s drinking. Any conversation we have with him, every response he gives seems like it was prepared so that he could get out of the current situation and back to being free to drink. When he was in the hospital for a week, he said that it helped somewhat, but mostly he was just doing what he had to to leave on time. He said he lied to his doctors and said he would stop drinking entirely, while he still thinks he can get past this and get to a point where he can drink casually.

I am concerned that he is entering a situation that is safe, but not conducive to his recovery, by returning home. His mother is an alcoholic (possibly recovering, possibly just beginning recovery, possibly active), and he says that the way he thinks about alcohol (striving to drink casually) comes from her. His father does not seem reliable. From our phone call, he does not seem to be taking this as seriously as he should. I am confident that he will be safe, that he will have access to mental health resources, and that he won’t have access to alcohol. However, I think that the presence of bad influences in his parents may make him think that he isn’t an alcoholic, or otherwise undermine the progress he makes.

I don’t know when/if he’ll be back. I’m planning to attend a consultation appointment with a substance abuse professional, to go through what happened and possibly learn some strategies to help him. We are very concerned about him returning to campus and believing he is “recovered”, in which he would start drinking again and have these same issues. 

I feel happy that he is safe. It feels like this chapter in his struggle (and our struggle to help him), where he was often in danger and left to his own devices, is over. But I can’t help but think the next chapter is setting him up to fail. If he returns, I don’t know how to support him in staying clear of alcohol, or in resisting the urge. I thought going to AA with him might work, and obviously we won’t drink around him anymore.

after surgery and in recovery.  This video is aimed not only at the transplant 

patient, but the family and caretakers of that person as  

well.

This is a great one to share as people going through it don't necessarily

broadcast the fact that they are literally dying at any crucial time of their

disease (yours truly was horrible at that and I wish I'd had done it differently,

As of yesterday, though, I am on a Planned Bender. I have been so dependent on marijuana since getting off alcohol that I now no longer feel ANYTHING even sucking down 250mg of 80% thc vape.

Yes, it’s bipolar. 

No, I don’t want to believe it.

While everyone's situation is unique, I saw many similarities to myself - and not just similar to where I am today - but where I was even just a few months/years ago as well. 

Today I am 7 days sober and feeling pretty ok. But 7 days ago, I was in a place that absolutely terrified me. But first some context on me. 

Like many - I have had a storied relationship with alcohol since my late teens. I'd argue that most of that time (say - 18 years or so) was fairly healthy - however in looking back - the signs and paths were all heading towards the same eventuality. Drinking on special occasions turned into  weekends, which turned into happy hours which turned into a nightcap which turned into a six pack which turned into both....

None of this - for me - was immediate though. And throughout all these years I had dry periods (always deliberate - they never ""just happened"") ranging from weeks to months. These periods, though positive - would later serve less as a motivator to be healthy so much as feed a false narrative to myself that I had full control over everything. Though I never committed myself to full sobriety - I would use these moments to tell myself I could quit whenever I wanted. I don't have a problem. This doesn't affect anyone. 

Conversely during this time I progressed through life and was grateful for all the opportunities afforded to me. I graduated college, I moved cities to start my career, I met my wife and got married, and had my first son. I received promotions and praise at work, and friends and colleagues seemingly enjoyed my company during a happy hour or event. I convinced myself that by doing well in those aspects - I couldn't *possibly have an issue with drinking.* Obviously - if I did - I would be much worse off, right? 

But the other stats were there as well. In between all those events were other events such as: 

1. The time I passed out/fell asleep on the steps of the subway station on the way home from a happy hour
2. The two times I vomited on my own bed, once with my wife in it
3. The credit card debt I accumulated from impulse purchases
4. The dozens of times I had to sleep in my car during my lunch break because I was hungover

As a pattern - I was a night-drinker, which usually meant after my son was asleep or wife was asleep. While I'd usually have an activity lined up - like playing video games with my friends, or catch up on work emails - that eventually just gave way to just using the time to drink - and do so until I fell asleep. Again - this further reinforced to me that this wasn't a problem, this was a confined activity. Sure, I woke up a little hungover - but I woke up right? Just drink a giant coffee in the morning and hit work head on. 

Repeat over and over again, day after day. Throw in a party, a holiday etc... and double the amount i had that day. 

Going back to last Wednesday - I had just woken up that day just like every other day. Nothing was particularly remarkable about it - except that I knew I had to grab my wife from the airport as she was flying back into town later that night. I had done this before dozens of times - it basically meant - sure I wouldn't drink so I could drive to grab her - but you know - once she's off to bed we'll resume SOP. 

Except that day - of all days - around 4pm - something was wrong. I began sweating profusely and my anxiety shot through the roof. I went to lie down but the feelings were just getting worse and worse. It took me awhile - but eventually I realized I was going through withdrawal. I was so angry at myself at that point. I wasn't even actually *craving* a drink. My body just decided at that moment - it needed it. Badly. 

I struggled through this through the rest of the night - and I grabbed my wife from the airport. She noticed I was irritable but otherwise was just tired and went to bed. After she fell asleep was where things got scary and the tremors set in. I was so angry with myself at this point, as I got up - and poured myself a measured glass of whisky and sat on the couch - in tears, drinking it. When it began to take the edge off what I was feeling (and really confirmed my fears) - I realized that was it. I couldn't do this anymore. I went to my wife and woke her up and told her everything, shaking and freaking out. That I didn't have it under control, that I was scared and how afraid I was of losing everything. 

We tried to ride it out together for a couple more hours (dozing off for a bit at one point) but eventually as the symptoms resumed getting worse - she drove me to the ER - where I was quickly taken in, diagnosed with severe AWS and given a bag of phenobarbital. It worked wonders on me for the symptoms and very quickly - but for the first time - in all those years - I finally realized I needed to listen to what every nurse and doctor said every time they came in my room- and for the first time I truly believed it: I needed to stop drinking. 

A week later - I am feeling ok. I haven't had much in the area of cravings or withdrawal symptoms - other than random surges of anxiety and insomnia. I am mostly just ashamed of myself it took this long or it took this - frankly life threatening event -  but I realize sobriety is the only way to go for me from now on. I'm entering an rehab/IOP program starting tomorrow morning, as well as attending my first AA meeting this weekend. I am optimistic but not naïve - and know this will likely get harder before it gets easier. This post is by no means a victory lap either - maybe just the start of a lifetime marathon.

Its more like a drug than a drink, you can feel it affect you immediately after your first good mouthful.

Anyway i am addicted to it, i have been dinking a bottle of it a day (wine bottle, 15%) for years, in a month i might have 1-3 days where i dont drink it.

Recently i started to feel sick, like id wake up nauseous and have very low energy and i realised i poisoned myself. I've been sober for 11 days and i know i cant drink buckfast again, i craved it like cigarettes. (i love not drinking it, i sleep so well and am fresh in the AM)

In the past, if i couldnt get buckfast i wouldnt drink anything else at home (you cant get it in my town, i have to drive about 6 miles to get it - also bars dont sell it so id only drink it at home).

So my question is, can i still enjoy a pint? or a glass of wine if im out for a meal? I was never a big pub drinker, im full after a few pints. I guess its a question i need to answer myself but when i think of my problems with drinking, im not thinking about the 3 post work pints on a friday, i'm thinking of opening a bottle of buckie on a monday night for no reason other than i crave it

The only times I ever saw him happy when I was little was when he drank, so I've come to fear him whenever he's happy and I become disappointed when drinking is the cause of his happiness.

The thing is that I understand addiction, and I'm geniunely concerned for him and always have been, but I cannot deal with these feelings anymore when I'm around him, I've come to recent him for everything he did whilst drunk and I know this isn't helpful neither to him nor me.

I wasn’t craving alcohol per say, I wasn’t having a big conundrum about it, I literally just felt like drinking with my friends so I did it. 

This experience has been very illuminating for me. I didn’t kindle myself after all; I didn’t have any insane anxiety or anything the days after. I also knew when to stop. I have zero desire to drink daily again like the cycle I was in 9ish months ago. I had been a daily drinker and my tolerance level had been getting scary high. I was getting to the point where drinking in the morning to calm myself down before work was looking attractive, and that’s when I knew I needed to cool my jets.

So, I quit drinking and I did A LOT, I mean A LOT of emotional work into why I had been drinking. I have done a lot of psychological and emotional healing over the last 9 months, and I feel like I really grew up and matured a lot. 

I don’t have any insane temptation or urge to drink daily again. In fact, I was reminded about how insane it was that I had been living that way. I felt so depressed on Sunday and knew it was the aftereffects from drinking, alcohol being a depressant and all. I also felt very foggy and lethargic, and I just don’t have time to feel like that these days. It doesn’t interest me anymore.

I’m not going to get cocky and think I can drink like a normal person because I know it’s only a matter of time until I take it too far again if I keep this shit up, but I’m also not going to throw nearly 9 months of progress and growth away and say “fuck it!” just because I drank twice. Black and white thinking was part of my problem previously and I’m not doing that anymore. I’m actually fairly pleased with myself and how I’ve handled everything and have zero plans to drink anytime soon and I’m not craving or scheming, and that’s a really good feeling.

So, yeah, idk. Sorry for the shitpost and sorry if this makes anyone feel weird or like if it worked for her maybe it could work for me…that wasn’t my intention. Maybe I’m deluding myself but I really just truly don’t feel the INSANE pull of alcohol like I used to. Did I really change something in myself over the 9ish months I was sober? I’d like to think so.

I tried making it by drinking 3 or 4 shower beers before school which helped but by the end of the day I was miserable.   I got suspended about a month ago for drinking at school but I managed to find a way I could take it and keep it in my car.

Late last year, my girlfriend had gone through a rehab program that seemed to help through therapy, medications, etc. Since then, things have been creeping back to the old days. Just 'one night of drinking' she promised. Which turned into wanting to do that once in a while, like monthly, then weekly.
At her job, they've done group happy hours, and now they are openly serving alcohol inside the workplace during work hours. She's afraid of anyone finding out about her alcoholism and the rehab, so she drinks. And of course she drives too, but I can't say her BAL is over limit. This is in the US, California, so it doesn't take much.

The pain is on the lower left side, below ribs but over waist, in that fleshy part. From my Google med school degree I believe this is where the colon is located?

My prayers were eventually answered when I learned about and was healed by Rhonda Lenair.

Sadly, I have had many losses in my life due to alcohol, including my 2 younger brothers who both died as a direct result of alcohol and countless friends and relatives who are either dead, imprisoned or handicapped because of alcohol.  I really have had enough with alcohol and empathize with anyone still struggling.  I pray that everyone that is still suffering with alcoholism, find a way to overcome it and start living the life you deserve.  You are worth it!

I decided earlier today that I needed extra support and to just say it out loud to someone I trusted, so I called my friend and told him about my problem. It went really well, and I felt like I'd taken a step in the right direction. I decided that I was going to stop drinking and saying it out loud was actually a huge step for me. I was actually contemplating telling my roommate as well, but just a few hours later I found myself restocking our alcohol supply instead. I said I'd stop when we ran out. I feel like a kid in a candy store when I walk through the liquor aisle and I guess that's all it took. For some reason now that I'm experiencing withdrawal, I'm getting more drunk with less alcohol. I completely blew up on my friend after only 2 drinks the other day, and I can't risk something like that happening again. I'm feeling like shit and craving a drink every minute, every day. It's literally all that I can think about besides how devastated I am that I have to give it up. I just recently spent 30 days sober without much issue and then did a lot of heavy drinking over a week, and now all of a sudden I'm acting like a dick while drunk and experiencing withdrawal symptoms when I'm not. This is coming up out of nowhere. I've never been in withdrawal, but I've just recently gone way longer than this with close to no difficulty. I don't know what is happening.

I'm kind of spiraling. The withdrawal gets worse every time I fuck up. After one drink, I have about an hour of feeling good, and then at least a day (so far) feeling like shit because of it. And it's only getting worse each time. I'm seriously starting to panic because I really just know that I can't control myself enough to avoid all the drinks we just bought and I'm seeing myself and my spirit decline after every drink. I'm also celebrating a birthday this week and I just don't see myself having the willpower to say no to at least one drink. I don't know if I can handle the brainfog from withdrawal right now either. I need to be able to function and I'm rapidly losing control.

I'm just not used to any of this being so terrible. It's like the long-term effects are hitting me all at once. Is this normal? Is it going to feel like this forever?

Right now she is self-detoxing on the advice of her doctor as the wait list for help is 4 weeks. She is 5 days in and has cut from 20 units a day to 18 (Dr initially said to cut down 5 units a week but she didn't feel ready at the time) but today she is asking if she can cut it down by 10% more a few days early.

My withdraw symptoms are the thing that really slapped me in the face. The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a one-time thing. But it wasn't. They've been coming every single day.

After doing some looking around I've decided to do a taper program. This seems the safest option for me. I'm also speaking with my GP about what I am doing when I see him tomorrow. 

Just looking around my apartment, I see how much my daily life has been influenced by the urge to drink. I keep electrolyte powder above my fridge because I drink. My phone sends me an alert at 5pm every day saying ""GO HOME"" to remind me not to stay too long at the bar. The glassware in my cabinets was selected specifically for liquor and cocktails. I have a large closet with mirrored doors that I have studiously never looked at myself in because I don't want to see what heavy drinking has done to my body. My daily supplements were chosen in reaction to alcohol. I've got a drawer full of viagra should I need to perform sexually after drinking. 

It used to be the case that I could wake up with a bit of a hangover and just go to the gym to sweat it out. That doesn't work anymore. I sure do sweat, that's certain. But when I'm finished I don't feel the same lift in my mood. Instead I am seized by this fantastic anxiety that would be awe-inspiring if it weren't so god damned gruesome. My hands shake violently. My brain clouds. I stop being functional and start being this dreadful collection of meat and emotional swings. 

So it's time. I'm beginning my taper today. 

While I don't think something like AA is really for me, it does help quite a bit to just vent and reflect. So I may be using this forum for that over the next several months.

I know this is just the first time and it’s only been fifteen days and I know this doesn’t apply for everyone. But I had some faith in myself and in my friends to not judge me for my choices (I didn’t tell them I’m an alcoholic, I said it was for ‘health reasons’ which is technically true).

I’d like to hope that that’s always the case but you never know - maybe I’ll crack down the line. But that first success, it’s really made me feel optimistic about the future. I think getting that first win, it really sets up the dominos you know?

I have been in recovery let me clarify I don’t consider myself sober as I am in recovery.  I just need reassurance and advice… all I can think about is how I feel like I can control my drinking which the past 6 months I have drastically.  I had a drink maybe 1 once every 2 weeks-ish which sometimes turned into once a week.  But you see the pattern I was going down the moderation management/harm reduction route but as much as I have been able to control my drinking for now it’s almost more anxiety inducing because I am always thinking about when I can and can’t drink and what’s okay.  A month ago I said I am happy knowing I can even have 1 drink a week.  Now here I am I haven’t had a drink in a week and all I can think about is if it’s alright for me to drink on the weekends or 2 days consecutively…. To make more sense Let’s say on a vacation or a trip I keep wondering and stressing myself over wether I will go into withdrawal after just 2 days of light drinking meaning like 2 beers a day.  The last time I went into withdrawal I binge drank a ton of alcohol for 3 days.  I feel like I already know the answer and a part of me says “why push it if you know what can happen” meaning why drink when I know it can cause health problems and when I have come this far why ruin my progress.  Basically my mind is playing games and is trying to justify my drinking.  I just need some advice… I think it’s too dangerous waters to try and find out if I can drink 2 days in a row.  I am too scared to try but yeah alcoholism sucks.  But on the other hand my life improved drastically after I went into treatment and I have only been through withdrawals once but am aware of kindling.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9953771829605103}"

I was a social drinker, then an every weekend drinker, then an every night drinker and then just a flat out drunk. Wake up, grab a pull of whatever I had to take the edge off, and start my day. Drink before work. Drink at work. At some point or another it became routine maintenance. I had become an alcoholic and my life was anything but manageable. It all seemed to happen so fast. When did this happen?

I knew at a younger age I was going to have to stop drinking. I just knew it. I’m a very obsessive person. I don’t really do many things half ass, drinking included. “Oh, a shot? Give me the bottle. I’m 100% all in and 100 mph in which never direction chooses me.

In my twenties I did the thing. You know, single, hung out with my friends and avoided anything that could be permanent or make me change (a relationship). I finished college and started doing what I wanted to do, I went to acting classes. I wanted to be Marlon Brando. I still do. Acting was my obsession at the time and alcohol was something I had a decent control over.

But at some point, the alcohol took over.

When I first moved to L.A. a co-worker of mine mentioned a story about a guy. This guy was so talented but he drank a thirty pack a day. So, he never got to be an actor. It wasn’t until I had a handle of whisky in my bedroom, I started to think “wait, am I becoming that guy? No way. You’re a struggling actor. You’re an artist. Be tortured, throw your inhibitions away and write like Hemingway, Miller or Williams. There’s no way you’ll die like them.”

I was malicious. I was angry. I was misunderstood. I had a chip on my shoulder the size of a fifth of vodka.

I moved back to St. Louis. At the time people thought it was because I was homesick, nah, I went where the party was. I felt like I was missing out. John Goodman has this great interview where he talks about how alcohol was one of the main deciding factors on him moving to New Orleans. He wanted to be where the alcohol was. Alcoholic's have one thing in common, they all think alike.

After a year or so of spoiling my liver and falling deeper and deeper into my alcoholism, the party suddenly ended. I met a girl. Now, the secrets out. There’s another person who knows how much I drink. She gets a front row seat to my one man show. I am now slowly becoming more and more aware of this lifestyle, that is slowly swallowing me whole and becoming my number one priority. Everything else that I loved or had a passion for took the back seat to my daily habit.

She was a drinker as well. Her and I used to drink every night. So in love, talking in circles, only to end up right back where we started. I wouldn’t trade those times for the world, but sometimes it feels like those were two completely different people back then. Her family was more open about the program and being an alcoholic. I thought it was weird. I knew everything. Don’t over communicate it, don’t dissect it, just don’t. I’m a man. Yeah.

A little over a year in, she decided to get sober. She went to 7 meetings a week, worked the steps, got a new job, did her passion stuff on the side, started getting more fit, laughing more, she was flat out flourishing. Then there’s me, angry as hell in the passenger seat whining about how my mom doesn’t love me. Then there’s me, complaining about how I look physically. Then there’s me, ranting for three minutes straight, blacking out in between, only to come to when everyone is looking at me like I have five fu\*kin’ heads.

She never pressured me or gave me any ultimatums. She knew this was hard, but being in a relationship with two people is hard as well. Dialogue was had frequently and I, like most alcoholics, get angry when the dialogue is centered around my drinking. So I do what most alcoholics do in this situation, I took offense. “You don’t think I can do it? Okay."" So I’d quit. I’d go three weeks here. A month there. Then I’d take one drink and say “see ya later” to anything and everything.

The last straw happened before we were supposed to take a trip to Chicago for a concert. I had not had a drink for 28 days. We were doing great. She was proud and happy and I was proud of myself as well. I had one drink while working a wedding... a fuc\*ing Moscow Mule. Those Russians, they'll get ya. I was off. Drunk three days before the trip, the whole trip and the way home. She didn’t accompany on my week long bender, she stayed home.

It was the first time in my life I realized I chose drinking over someone who truly loves me for me.

I gutted through the trip. I faked it. I was sad and on the verge of breaking down. Checking my phone every five minutes. Nothing. She was done. I could feel it. So, to cope, I drank enough to kill a small horse that weekend. All kinds of crap. Stupid stuff that I never drink. Italian cordial shots and weird stuff like that. I was with a traveling salesman, you get the picture. Now, I’ve never really had panic attacks. Anxiety, yeah. But a full blown “this is it, this is where I die, right here on this couch in someone’s living room” type of mental breakdown, never really happened to me. I was close a few weeks prior, but I just chalked that up to being tired. It's always something other than alcohol. The last day I woke up and knew a panic attack was coming. I could feel something that I had never really felt before. Most likely the same feeling you feel right before you die. So I did what I normally did when I felt like I was losing my mind, I ran from it. I grabbed the first bottle I could find, Gin. “Yeah gin should do the trick” and I mixed it with some Tang, at 7 am. Tang! Like it’s ‘98. I gutted it down. Only two hours until I get on the train, four more after that and I’m home. I just have to get home.

I get a cab, barely. The gin and tang buzz has me making best friends with the cabby. So funny how drunks always think people are their best friends, when in reality, they’re just drunk at 9 am. Anyway, the impending doom had subsided for the time being. I get to the station and have to sprint to my train. I'm rarely ever running behind, like I said, unmanageable. I get on the train “I’ll fall asleep, wake up and be home”. Nope. Closed my eyes for about twenty minutes and the panic starts to come back. I’m starting to sweat. I’m tired. Little dots and stains cross my vision, my head is fogged and bogged down. ""I'm dying for sure on this train, this is it"". “I can’t do it” I make my way to the bar car. I manage to tame the shakes as I swipe my card. It’s just me, a very slow and stoic bartender and my medicine. I felt about two feet tall as I sit alone in a booth, staring out the window, trying to find something interesting or hopeful in the never ending fields of Kansas. I begin to cry. And cry. And cry. The bartender's just looking at me the way anyone would look at a grown man who is drunk at 10am and crying. For 4 straight hours I had tears running down my face and a cold plastic cup in my hand to help get me through it.

I listened to 2 songs on repeat “Last Time” and “Change 4 Love” over and over again. All I kept thinking about was how I let my person down, I continue to let myself down, I am not a good brother, I am not a good son, I am not a good role model, I am slowly becoming a statistic and there is zero chance I will ever become anything close to significant if I keep this up. Then it hit me “holy shit, I have to stop drinking”.

I lived in Vegas for a few years. What a great place for a drunk, right? One of my best friends had a grandfather who quit drinking “cold turkey”. When you’re in your mid twenties, that seems insane and unimaginable. I didn’t believe it. Then they pointed to a bar stool and said “he drank his beer, said I’m done and never went back to it”. I thought that was incredible. That story always stuck with me. Every once in a while someone will say something significant to you. Something about it will resonate and you realize they weren't saying it to you, they were saying it for you. That story made so much more sense to me on the train, it clicked. I believe I felt, for the first time, what my friends grandfather may have felt that day. The parties over, man. You’re done. You did your dance with the thing and you’ve been off beat for too long. Your life and family are more important than this pint. You're done.

So, I get home. I call my girlfriend and tell her ""I think I'm ready. What do I need to do? I will do anything you ask of me. I need help"". We talked and I cried and she cried and then I get off the phone, I grab two airplane shots of whisky and four beers. I wasn't going to get drunk, I was weening myself off. I know, I did it the way you’re not supposed to. I should’ve checked into a clinic or hospital but I didn’t. Something seriously bad could’ve happened to me and I do not recommend anyone else doing the same. I know myself. I had to go through it alone and face myself. Just me, my mirror and my thoughts. That’s all I wanted. That and the occasional sip of a beer or whisky to keep the edge off.

What I went through that night and the following day, I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I’ve had hangovers. This was my body saying “yeah, do it again. Come on. Drink again and we will shut your sh\*t down for good”. There’s a scene from the movie “Basketball Diaries” where Jim is coming off of heroin, that’s how I felt. Not as dramatic, because it’s Leo, but that’s how I imagined I looked.

I made it through it. And I’m happy to say I haven’t had a drink since. Today marks my two years and I am very proud of myself. My girlfriend and I are better than ever. Both sober. After I was sober for six months, I was finally ready to move back to L.A. where I can pursue my thing and she can get her masters. All was good. Then, about three weeks after we settled in, the whole world shut down. Yeah, perfect. Two recovering alcoholics leaning on one another in a new city. If I was still drinking, there’s no doubt I would’ve drown in my apartment complexes swimming pool. I mean, this lockdown was a drunks wet dream. Free money, no meetings or work. I am so grateful I chose to get sober when I did.

Since being sober, I’ve made two short films, got into some festivals, made a web series, a comedy special, writing a feature now, made some music that I’ve wanted to make since I was 17, gained some weight, lost some weight, got a therapist and plan to ask the girl I used to drink with every night to be the person I share a home with for the rest of our lives.

I don’t have a problem being around alcohol. Do the thoughts creep in? Of course. Hell, the last two weeks have been extremely tough. This subreddit helps a lot. I don’t judge, envy or resent anyone who’s able to drink. I couldn’t do it and that’s the simple truth. It's not their fault I can't do it, it's mine. There are plenty of things I can’t do, so I don’t do them. I wrecked every motorcycle I got on when I was a kid, so I stay away from them as an adult. I. Can’t. Drink. You think a person who can’t swim, dives off a boat in the middle of the ocean? No, they know They. Can’t. Swim. Because they tried it and they almost died. It’s not that simple but it kind of is. I had to admit I was powerless over alcohol, admit defeat, swallow my pride and give 100% of myself to my sobriety.

To all my guys out there, it’s okay to lose. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to be in pain. It’s okay to admit defeat. No matter how big or strong you you think are, this thing is just as big and strong, but not undefeated.

For everyone who thinks it’s hopeless or you’ll never stop, it isn’t hopeless and you will stop, if and when you decide to. Listen when people tell you they love you, because you are loved. If you’ve got a couple hours, days, weeks, months or years sober, be proud of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be patient with yourself. Sobriety is hardly ever a linear path. Keep going! I promise you there is nothing in life that alcohol has made better. Being present with your emotions and planted in the moment are the greatest joys life can give you. I could slip up tomorrow, I don’t know. What I do know is, I’m two years sober today and my fingers hurt.

Sincerely,

\-EC

Does it get better? Are there any spouses that deal with this and tell me if its worth it?

He's saying he will go to an actual rehab place and take time off work this time. I had given him 6 months to make some changes or else I was leaving. In that time he has gotten drunk 3 times and we are only on month 2. Last night when he came home drunk I told him to leave. He spent a few hours trying to break the door down to get in and called me non stop to let him in. I thought he had left since he started calling me saying he was grabbing food and will go somewhere else for the night. So I took off the mechanism I was using to keep the door jammed so the key wouldn't work for him. I thought he understood because one time when he did this and was scaring me I called the police and they made him leave to a friends house so I thought he was going there again. Anyway so I un jammed the door because in the morning I have to take our dog out and figured I would be annoyed to do it then. He came home. There was conflict and I took an overdose of pills but I'm still here and hes apologising and saying he will go somewhere since the aa meetings aren't working. I am so tired and just lost. Do I believe him again?

I feel so stuck. I have no support from anyone and I can't financially make it on my own. Even if I could I can't take care of our dog alone and I don't want to leave her behind. I feel so stuck and alone and I have been suicidal many times but it doesn't matter to him. We were supposed to be ttc but that obviously isn't happening now. I don't want kids with our lives like this but I'm freaking out because I'm having issues conceiving when we were trying anyway and are having fertility tests and appointments done. So my bio clock is ticking, my husband is an alcoholic and I'm too dependent on him to leave. I was in a car accident a while back and I can barely work.

I’ve been in a relationship almost two years now. It’s been amazing; he’s smart, he’s funny, we get along, have in depth discussions on news because we LIKE it. There is one issue, and it’s his drinking.

I will admit, he’s cut down QUITE a bit in the last few months, but I fear it’s only out of necessity. I don’t know how to move forward with his mentality. 

1. He got the covid last year and turned into one of those long haul patients you hear about on the news. After he got better his immune system kept working and destroyed his nerves. He was told he needed to cut down so that the nerves could re heal. Didn’t help much.
2. I’ve been the only one working and financing this for almost a year since he lost his ability to walk. I don’t see him as a number, but he gets defensive every time I try to bring up what a strain it is on our finances. 
3. I smoke a little weed. It’s for my anxiety so I don’t pop a bajillion Xanax and I set myself a specific budget for it. I’ve cut down significantly since he moved in because he tried to use it as a leveraging tool against my arguments for him getting sober. I’ve offered to quit altogether if he does, but that’s never something he’s been interested in.
4. I am now out of a job. I thought me losing the only source of returning income would kick him into gear, but nope. Still every day he’s bringing home “just a beer” for one fucking reason or the other. 


He says I don’t understand; that I just don’t get how this affects him and I can’t “just” ask him to stop. But I’ve tried everything. Cutting him off seems childish but it’s starting to look like my only option. 


He once told me he wishes he hadn’t gotten into this relationship with this addiction. It hurt at the time but I completely get it, and what destroys me is that I wish that too. It could have avoided hours of arguments, pints of tears, and thousands and thousands of dollars of sunk cost for “just a beer”. 

I love this man with all my heart. He’s a wonderful person and I know he’s a hard worker. But I don’t know where to go from here. He’s said over and over again- this is my last hurrah. This is my last night drinking, so I want one more “real” round (shot of whiskey and a beer).

My partner is currently in rehab for a month. We are less than a week in so there is still a while to go, during his detox at the moment I have no contact with him. The road to rehab hasn't been easy and we've had some hurdles in our relationship. I have definitely been hurt a lot and been victim to some of his very poor decisions and behaviours. I have tried my best to work through it with him and be patient, to separate who he is as a person and his illness. To recognise and to show to him that he is worthy of love and support despite the addiction. But, on the first or second day he went in I discovered some very unsettling truths that have really changed my perspective of him. He had another girlfriend overseas, which I was aware of, and I had tried very hard to ensure that she knew he was also in a relationship with me. He insisted that he'd been open and honest with her and that she was in the loop. I have since found out after lots of communication with her that she had no idea about me at all. He lied to me about having been honest with her, and he lied to her about a whole other relationship he was in. He even promised her multiple times that she was the only person for him and he wasn't seeing anyone else. This is a massive betrayal to us both. 

Now I know that dishonesty is common in tangent to alcoholism but I guess I'm trying to figure out whether something as big and hurtful as this is normal to lie about. Can it be put down to his addiction, or is he simply a bad person? Is it more likely that he has some sort of personality disorder that would cause him to be deceitful? I have read that some disorders tend to go hand in hand with substance abuse.  

But more than all of those questions, I just want to know how likely it is that he will feel guilt and remorse and make the steps to change after rehab. Can anyone who has been through the process of rehabilitation give me some kind of insight to this? Did you find that it helped you want to amend your wrong doings? Were you able to adjust your behavioural patterns to be a better person to your loved ones? I just don't know if I will ever be able to trust him again. But so much of me wants to be patient and forgiving and recognise that his hurtful actions could have been out of his hands.  I want to be the loving and supportive partner that I would hope others would be to me if I were in his position of hardship.

I don't know where to go from here with our friendship because it's clear she can't rely on me anymore. I can't just change overnight and I feel like she just doesn't understand. What should I tell her?

My(21m) friends have been telling me that I have a drinking problem for a few months now, and I've never taken it seriously. But still, I did not expect this. The other night my friend and I were hanging out, and my drinking was mentioned, as it often is. If I'm being completely honest, I'd had a couple drinks before, and during, the conversation so I don't remember the whole thing. I don't know why this conversation was different than the others we've had, but I felt like I was being disrespected and I was lashing out a lot when I normally just laugh it off. It just got really emotional and she kind of backed me into a corner so I couldn't avoid the conversation. I didn't take it well at all and I remember saying some things that were really uncalled her in an attempt to get her to drop it. Honestly, I didn't listen to her at all and the more I think about everything, the more I feel like I've screwed up.

Now, I don't know what to do from here. First, I need to figure out an apology because I know I said things that were uncalled for. I guess also apologize for not remembering the majority of the conversation, too but I don't even know how to admit that. I don't know what to do or say because I've already said all that I can and it hasn't been good enough. I don’t know what would make her feel better.

Most of all, this just feels so stupid and embarrassing. I honestly don't even know why she's taking this seriously. I genuinely feel like this is going to work itself out and I'll think it's ridiculous that I was worrying so much about it in a couple of months. I know she's offering her support, but she's also holding me accountable and I don't know how to live with that. It feels like the exact opposite of support. and now I feel like I""m under way more pressure than I can handle right now. It sucks because if I just didn't tell her about my drinking, she wouldn't see it and this wouldn't be a problem because most people seem happy to not notice, or at least not confront it. This feels like way too much pressure and I have no idea how to address it in a way that would be productive at all. She just made it so I can't avoid it anymore.

I can understand exactly what this looks like, but I'm just trying to be honest at the very least. I wasn't going to lie to her to make her feel better. It's like my feelings are all working against me. I can't do what she's expecting of me, or what she wants me to do and I guess that's just more clear than ever now.

I don't even drink that much and I've been doing better lately. The past week, I've had a lot of drinks, but that was because of a celebration. After this, I'm going to run out for another while. I don't know how to be honest with her without lying but at this point I""m just letting her down and being a bad friend. It feels like that's all I can do. This doesn't seem like a huge deal to me and I'm completely able to function in my life, but this is still bringing up a lot of emotions and conflict.

I'm really not deep enough into this for AA or anything, and I don't think there's anything she can do to support me. I'm trying to get therapy. This is so hard.

Anyways, thanks for listening. Would be great if anybody had some advice on how to apologize or fix this, or where to take it from here. Thank you.

We talked again recently, and I found out I was way more drunk and way more angry than I thought I was.

I can't believe who I turned into, and who i’ve become in order to defend my drinking. I apologized, and we made up, and she's truly being an amazing friend. If that conversation didn't go well, I'd be in a very, very different place.

She quit temporarily quit after her second hospitalization but it didn't last long.

Well she came to my house on 7/10 for my courthouse wedding. I told her no alcohol in the house. She snuck some over anyways and was drinking in the car, I had no idea. The next day she was severely sick and had to be rushed to the ER on the day of my wedding. Nearly died. 

After she was released. I told her to quit drinking (again) and go to counseling, AA, ETC. She never did. 

Well I called her up out of the blue about two months ago just to check on her and she had been drinking again. 

So I told her, if she wants to have anything to do with me, my new wife, and our life, she needs to quit drinking and get help. So I quit talking to her for a while (my older brother did the same thing years ago and I didn't realize why until now).

Well she texted me yesterday asking if I could talk. She called me later on, and she was drunk. I was just thinking to myself, are you fucking kidding me? And then decided to nonchalantly tell me she's taking medications for seizures. Which after to talking to my brother about it, she's not really having seizures. I think she was just saying that to make me feel bad and maybe start talking to her again. 

Then she proceeds to tell me ""sometimes I just wish I would just lie down on the couch and it would all be over"". She doesn't want to get treatment or health insurance. So she told me if she gets sick again she's just gonna stay home.

So after that conversation, I'm just over it.

I also get it in my throat, eyes, and ears, so I hear ringing, have blurry vision and feel like I'm choking. It's absolutely brutal.

I realized that drinking reduces the severity of it and fell into the habit of drinking every time I have a bad spell. I told my neurologist and he said that alcohol legitimately ""treats"" myoclonus. He ordered a bunch of tests to find a medication for it but for the next 3-ish months... how do I break this habit?

I even started drinking instead of eating sometimes because I struggle to prepare food.

New sobriety date 
September 3 2021


A head full of AA 

I cant tell you how many speaker meetings i went to, fell asleep in, said fuck this i want to drink, was forced to go BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT IT FOR MYSELF 

Drunk at my sisters wedding passed out in the bushes on the golf course with my family videoing and laughing at me 
Drunk at my dads party on the lake with him telling the bartender to cut me off and me jumping in my car and leaving cause I was pissed and went to the casino and lost more money and drank more 
The bar taking my keys and my mom having to drive me home and then falling and almost bashing my head on the cement 
Waking up in vomit 
Falling down in multiple bars
Not remembering where i was or how i got there 
Standing up in the convertible doing 50mph wasted out my mind
Sleeping in the car cause i was too drunk to drive
Throwing up in my apartment
Throwing up in the dorm room in college
Throwing the alcohol bottles in the dorm room on the roof of the building so they wouldn’t be seen 
Being drunk at a car show and almost getting run over 
Mixing the vodka with the sprite in my green Gatorade bottle and squirting it til i was basically wasted.....
Asking for a pitcher of corona on my 21st  (this was funny, because I didn’t realize you couldn’t get a pitcher of corona)
Being so drunk one night and bashing my elbow on the sidewalk....hurt for a year
Dry heaving behind the bar after i got kicked out
Leaving with random people because i couldnt stand up and they wanted to help...
Had every intention to go to an awesome concert....went to the bar beforehand and got too drunk to stand up and attend the concert...this happened to the same concert twice in 2 years….all because I wanted to be buzzed at the concert 
Mrytle beach off the everclear.....threw up all over the hotel and my friends clothes that were on the floor....ruined the room 
Lost my wallet in myrtle beach because i was drunk 
Almost got my head bashed in by people for pissing them off when i was drunk multiple times 
Buying a half gallon of vodka in college and seeing if i could get wasted 7 days in a row.....who does this
Absolutely trashed at my sisters high school soccer game in Jenison...laying on cement 
Falling down in the Navy hotel and my friend keeping me up when i was court ordered to stay sober....i also thought i could win a friendly fight i picked and got fucking rocked...my head was pounding for the whole next day mind you...a friendly fight 
I got absolutely wasted in Virginia and called my sister at midnight drunk. Left my phone on silent for 12 hours as i went to an amusement park. Came back to the ship and everyone was looking for me. My family thought I had died because i left my phone on silent. This happened a few times in my drinking career. Had cops come to my apartment while i was passed out because sister was worried because she knew I had been drinking.

Started drinking at 21....not much before that because my parents didn’t allow alcohol in the house.....i flew off the rails. Blew a .078 after a concert while i was driving...so close to. A DUI in December 2016
And then drinking and driving with my friends in the back country of Michigan during a snow storm. We saw the cop sitting at the side of the road as we drove past. He pulls out and flashes us with his red and blues. “Your headlights aren’t on.” I think i failed my sobriety test but he just let us go and made someone else drive. We popped the rest of the beers and celebrated not going to jail. Everyone was under 21 except myself. 2015 
My first rehab doesn’t count even though i went through withdrawals with the shaking and the chills and was self admitted through my parents referral because how could i be an alcoholic at 23 years old 
I just started drinking at 21....

I got out of my first rehab and picked up like 2 days later after getting out of mindfulness classes and being in lockdown in the psych ward for a month 
I met my boss there and she got me a job at a restaurant 
My parents kicked me out a month later because i showed up to the house drunk when their one rule of the house was to not get drunk 
They were not happy because of my drinking and paying for rehab 
I got fired from that job a few months after having it because of the open bar Super Bowl party where i ended up driving home wasted and the boss knew it....sorry thanks for working here...goodbye.

My next apartment didn’t help that there was a dive bar behind it....my new favorite drinking spot where I didn’t have to go far to get wasted. I could leave my car parked at my apartment and walk to the bar. A few months of drinking and working later my folks brought up sunny California rehab out of the cold winters of Michigan. I went willingly and said to hell with Michigan

February 23 2018 was my sobriety date 
As I touched the ground in California off the airplane I did not have a single drop of a drink for 5 months and 28 days in rehab actively attending aa, yoga, mindfulness, speaker meetings, church, church AA groups, staying sober at concerts, attending 7 meetings a week sometimes...but because I wasn’t working a program 
All it took was one half empty open bottle of wine handed to me at my job.....
I took a swig
Didn’t get drunk off it 
I thought about it for 15 mins before i did it 
Didn’t take the 6 month chip 
GONE because I didn’t take it seriously 
I enjoyed the people, i enjoyed the stories and the meetings, but I didn’t want to stay sober for me.....i even saw and heard all the positive stories and the miraculous miracles their high power brought them to. 
I missed my family and the holidays were fast approaching....i quit the job i was working and was a month of savings away from being homeless with no car the rent is just fucking expensive living on the ocean in Southern California 
Quit the job, quit California went back home and struggled with alcohol and the bottle and sobriety and AA...because i was attending aa without a sponsor and still decided to get drunk....hell, i went to a few AA meetings drunk which brings me to my next point 
I NEVER LEFT MY DRINKING FRIENDS BEHIND WHEN I SHOULD OF.....which was i could never stay sober for long
Hey Austin let’s go drinking...i got you...your the life of the party....well just have a few....okay I’m gain lets go!
I remember a time in michigan at 1 in the morning...leaving one of my favorite  bars....i knew i was drunk...shouldn’t of been driving. Had to work the next day at 7am. Tried to get on the freeway and swiped the wealthy st bridge on ramp with the side of my car and the right mirror. Decided I couldn’t stop because i was 2 miles from the downtown police station and i got home the 15 mile drive swerving in and out of the highway lines trying to keep the car straight the best i could. Made it home safely and observed the damage to the car in the morning....it wasn’t that bad lol 

There was the time i went on a cruise with my best friend and drank more in alcohol then i paid for the cruise....Always always get the drink package if you are an alcoholic hahaaaahaha...what you dont know will hurt you on your first cruise. 
When the cruise got back to port and we had to board the plane that night for some reason in my mind i hadn’t had enough to drink..that was it...spring break was over that fast..i mean it was fun but damn...i stole Coronas from the airport and took 3 shots and had 2 doubles and had the ride of my life from Fort Lauderdale to michigan.....there wasn’t one person that liked me on that flight. Especially not the people who sat around me...and idk if you know this or not....airplanes arent that big 
I asked for another throw up bag....she said i thought i just gave you one and handed me another...the other throw up bag that she handed me was in my pocket i found out later on 
The flight attendants gave me the look as i got off the plane in Detroit like what the fuck never do that again as i had vomit all over my clothes. i checked off being drunk on an airplane off my check off list.....

I look over at some point during the flight and the two gorgeous lesbians sitting next to me had to cover their nose with their shirts....my smell was gone and I’m like oh fuck 

At another point in the flight I was feeling as good as you can when your fucking wasted and had my head in my lap trying to feel better 
As we hit turbulence and the plane started shaking that was all I needed to not feel great at all and started throwing up again 



I met my first sponsor when I moved to Virginia  through an internet AA sober group with 15000 members.....he was my 2nd sponsor. The first one was great with 20 years of sobriety but when i left Cali we lost contact. David. YOU CANT GO THROUGH THE STEPS WITH A SPONSEE IF THEY ARENT WILLING TO GO PAST THE FIRST STEP AND THAT WAS ME TO A T....
We talked on and off for 3 months until....until....i was court ordered a year to stay sober 
He watched my life crumble before my eyes as i refused to give up drinking blowing all of my money on it....every last dime i had...took 7 grand out the stock market which was what i had saved up at the time....blew it all on alcohol within 4 months. 
Drinking, coke, mental break downs, almost killing myself multiple times, pissed in a public park in the lake, homicidal thoughts, screaming at the top of my lungs in a park on a bright and sunny day because i was fed up with everything. Calling up my family and cursing them out telling them they were the problems for this....and they never stopped loving me. My sister would FaceTime me and I’d be at the bar drinking completely blowing her off. 
The funny thing is alcohol was not the reason i got arrested. And i mean that. But if i hadn’t been in a bar drinking even one drink, then I wouldn’t of been put in jail for fighting. 
I stopped hanging in bars after that. Or so I thought....People in bars...like to drink lol 
And if your trying to be sober its the hardest thing in the world to turn down free shots or whatever they’re drinking. 
I call bars FUCK YOU UPS. I dont like to go into fuck you ups because they fuck you up. In these first few years of sobriety i choose not to sit at the bar even if I’m by myself. The temptation to get drunk is as high as ever. To blot out. To forget. To stay numb. Especially when you can afford to. Thoughts come into play which is why going into FUCK YOU UPS is a bad idea. Just one drink. Just this one time. It wont hurt. It feels good. It tastes good. It looks good. You’ve been doing so well. Reward yourself. The people are nice. The bar tender is nice. This bar is nice. The bottles are nice. You can do it! That glass of wine is nice. The ceiling is nice. The air feels right. The smell is good. Its free (or at least it feels free). The air outside is cold. The air outside is hot. The air outside is jus right. DO IT!!!!!


So many times I’ve been on the floor throwing up, can’t stand up, black out, blown so much fucking money i didn’t care if i was dead in the morning. cursed out good people, made a fool of myself, kicked out the bar, dry heaving in a dark parking lot behind a building, one time i almost froze to death in Michigan. The week before New Year’s 2016. 
When was enough going to be enough with alcohol. It was never going to be enough. I always needed fucking more. 

I relapsed and relapsed and relapsed the very last week of my drinking or so I thought....I told Johnny off and i went and got absolutely wasted even though i only wanted a cold beer. 
I then apologized to Johnny and he said, yeah, I know and i was like damnit it LOL you already know me....
I was always honest with johnny....something drew me to him 
Our pasts were the same and he was easy to relate too. 
Pretty rare for finding him on the internet and him hitting me up tell me he had this wonderful spiritual experience with new found sobriety. I believed him and wanted the same for myself 
He had been a Marine who served for 4 years and in that time he got in a lot of trouble with alcohol especially when he beat up a Navy guy in a bar which I thought was funny
In the first week of trying this new AA thing (considering it was my first time submitting i texted him “I’d feel better talking once I get 3 weeks of sobriety....right now I’m just not in the right head space.
He texted back. No problem I’m here Austin
Short and simple.
I went and got obliterated losing $150 at the bar and got in more trouble. I texted him the next day....I fucked up so hard telling him what happened 
BASICALLLY what I’m trying to say when I’m not in the right head space is i want to keep drinking. 
He texted back. I know Austin. 
IT HELPS TO HAVE AN HONEST SPONSOR AND IT HELPS EVEN MORE WHEN YOUR HONEST WITH THEM. 
With the information you tell them short of your bank accounts 401k social security number they can really hurt you if they are not about helping other alcoholics achieve sobriety.....

Up until December 2020 I couldn’t really remember the last time I got super drunk. I bought a bottle of vodka December 6 2020 and drank it slow for the week it lasted. From October to December I never got drunk. I enjoyed beers from time to time feel a buzz and then go to bed.
December 19 2020
My room mates went to New York for a weekend trip and When they were around I wouldn’t go out and get drunk. They were kind of like my “safe guards” 
I went out to a country dance bar in Virginia. Because of covid they had to stop selling alcohol at 10pm. I started off with the jack and coke. Decided I hated it. Drank some and then dumped the rest out. I made sure I had no less than 3 drinks on the table the whole night. I became pretty drunk. My buddy asked if I was driving and I said no which was obvious a lie. I left before they closed and drove to the beach at midnight. I walked out to the end of the pier and listened 
To the water and felt the cold wind off the ocean. I left shortly after. On the way back to my home I street raced another car going 110mph for 15 miles. We never saw a cop.....if I would’ve of i would’ve not only lost the license. Lost the Navy career. Lost the finances. Lost EVERYTHING. Did I mention I was still on probation from March 24 2020 incident which I was still awaiting a court date for. 
I guess after that night I just decided to be done because I don’t make great decision when I drink....
Not to mention I spent _________$ on alcohol in 2020
It was so much because I cashed out my investment account worth $8000 and I had that money to blow and had no hobbies 

A sponsor is 
Someone you can tell anything to and they have your back no matter what 
They will definitely know more than just your alcohol and drug addictions...they will know why you used and what got you to that point. 
I RECOMMEND SOMEONE WITH MORE THAN A YEAR OF SOBRIETY AND LESS THAN 5 YEARS OF SOBRIETY 
I always thought that people with lots of time have big egos and its okay to have a big ego and I’m so glad you remained sober but sometimes that big ego can get in the way and be hard to relate to if you are brand new to this sober thing. Just my personal experience not bashing anyone. 


KEY POINTS (everything that is in big letters)

I couldn’t move forward until I wanted it for myself

No relationships in the first year of sobriety

I never left my drinking friends behind when i should of

You can’t go through the steps with a sponsee if they aren’t willing to go past the first step....if they don’t want it they aren’t ready yet

I call Bars FUCK YOU UPS AND THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COST

It helps to have an honest sponsor and it helps for you to be honest with them...when you relapse you tell them 

I was honest right off the bat with my sponsor telling him my deepest darkest secrets 

I recommend a sponsor with a minimum of 1 year of sobriety and no more than 5 years because of ego and relating with new sponsees and how hard it is to relate 

Never invite someone from AA with little to no sobriety (anything under a year) to an open bar party 


January 22 2021
RELAPSE
Michael and grace fought the whole god damn week
I spent $2000 on car repairs that day 
Me and my co workers threw $5 into the pot to bet who could get a free drink first
We all go to MJS; the bar agreed upon 
I made a conscious decision to relapse 
I got to the bar a half hour early because that’s what an alcoholic does; and the bars close early at 10pm because of covid 
Yup I’ll have a vodka red bull because that’s my go to when I’m trying to get drunk 
Mise well will go all out if I’m going to fuckin relapse tonight
I walk into the bar that I haven’t been in in 6 months and all the bartenders are shocked and I get 3 free drinks 
My friends text me and I get 3 fireball shots for them 
They show up and we all do the fireball shots
My buddy owes me $5 so I just tell him to buy me a trash can drink and that’ll do! 
Finish that
Order another one and then a corona and drink my co workers extra vodka crab berry drink 
By the end of the night I noticed I had 7 Co workers in the bar and they were all pissed that I was wasted
I fell over multiple times and couldn’t stand straight
Grace was pissed at me because I wouldn’t tell her where I was 
Turns out they’ve been driving all over Virginia Beach looking for me because they’re concerned 
My friends grabbed my phone and my keys and lied to me the whole night about having them
They texted grace and Michael to come pick my ass up because I had been laying under the pool table of the bar drunk out of my mind 
I pay my tab at 9:50pm and leave with grace and Michel 
As they’re carrying me outside the bar I take a video 
He drives my car back across town 
And I proceed to choke out his wife and get in a huge argument about that 


March 31st 2021 
My new co worker gets to the ship whom I know is just as insane and crazy as me...he is 21 and I am 26 Yrs old 
He doesn’t have a car and I have a fast Pontiac convertible with an awesome stereo system 
Hey petty 
Let’s go out tonight?
Yeah he’ll yeah
We’ll meet my boy Thompkins whom I went to dive school and failed out with 
He’s on a diff ship so it works out perfectly 
Me and petty get off work and head straight to the convertible 
Petty doesn’t have a credit card because thompkins has it from the previous week where he got to drunk and left it somewhere 
Before we get to the brewery I let petty play music on his phone because my music is the same
Payphone by maroon 5 comes on
I pull up to a payphone at a gas station and petty films me acting like I’m at the payphone with payphone by maroon 5 playing off the cars stereo system 
Petty got all the good camera angles and the video turned out great 
We get to the brewery and thompkins meets me and petty there at 5pm 
Me and petty already had our beers....my favorite being the IP IPA
I leave my car at the bar we all get into thompkins car....yay I don’t have to drive 
We go next door to another bar with full iquor
Petty loves vodka cranberry and I’m picky af so I get a grapefruit vodka drink That I didn’t enjoy 
I leave it there and pretty soon we’re off to the next bar
The next bar we order food and do shots 
I buy a round and order more drinks
After that bar we go to another bar 
By now I’m feeling pretty good
Im at that drunk stage where I start smoking cigarettes in the back of the car
(I don’t smoke cigarettes) 

We get to the next bar called hanks filling station 
Petty makes a fool of himself talking to a table full of girls
We all have one beer at hanks and go back to the previous bar we were just at. 

Petty is getting more drunk and standing out the fuckin sun roof the Lincoln and screaming fuck 12 whatever that means. It is 9:13pm and raining 
Whiskey glasses is playing over the cars stereo system along with before he cheats....we were in a country mood lol 

We arrive and there is an entourage of 12 people celebrating a birthday. 
Fuckin thompkins immediately orders 12 shots of whatever....
I hold back because I’m sipping on my red bull vodka and chatting it up with some of the people there. Thompkins comes over to me and hands me a shot...you didn’t get one bro
Here’s one on me 
I look over my shoulder and petty is standing up talking to a female 
Next thing I fuckin know one of the ladies that worked at the bar yells get up get up and come over here
I slowly get up and walk over around the corner by the other drink machine

Petty is on the fuckin ground and basically passed the fuck out 
He has a huge gash in his head that looks like he needs stitches with serious swelling 
Me and thompkins some how get petty to his car....very hard
Petty was basically unresponsive 
15 mins later we get back to my car
I’m smoking a cigarette in the back of the car petty is hunched over in the driver seat and thompkins is throwing up outside the car hunched over 

Thompkins eventually opens my car door and I put petty in the passenger seat and say thanks to Thompkins for a fuckin awesome night 
I drive petty carefully back to bae ship yards where my ship is 
You can’t go on base because if they suspect you’ve been drinking the gate guard will breathalyze you on the spot
There is no gate guard at bae ship yards
We also have to be to work and be in attendance at 8am 
We pass out in the car until 3:30 am wake up and walk back to the ship 

I tried to get him to medical but he refuses to go and I said fuck it and let him go to bed
7am everyone wakes us up to be to work and they notice petty
Petty keeps saying I’m fine and they’re like no your fuckin not
The bruise on his head is huge and thank God he never needed stitches 
I get fucking cussed out for letting him go to sleep and we both get cussed out and are told strictly not to hang out with each other again
I get severely yelled at by my bosses and they made me feel like shit
We just sent you to fucking school and this is How you treat us, by spitting in our fuckin faces. Your a grown ass fuckin man. Mommy and daddy can’t fuckin save you no more.” We also got yelled at for being at a bar when we were not supposed to be because of covid.

I’m 30 and over the last year or two, my drinking has increased to nearly daily. A few weeks ago I decided to cut back to weekends only. A few things I have noticed since then:

I catch myself thinking about alcohol during the day. I started thinking about it just now, which is why I started this post. 

Some days I just say “fuck it” like on Monday of this week. I went and got some wine (which I can drink over several hours and barely feel a buzz at all)

When I am at home and make the decision of “I think I will drink now” I get a little thrill. I feel almost giddy, like super excited to drink. 

I have the ability to not drink, but I’m not happy about it. I don’t have typical withdraw symptoms, no shakes, heavy cravings, etc. I get this feeling of “it’s been a week/several days, I feel fine, I should be able to drink now” like I deserve it or something 

I guess I’m just wondering if this feeling is familiar to anyone. Do I need to be worried? Are these feelings somewhat normal? Is full blown alcoholism much more serious than this?",29,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9916210174560547}"

  My mother was emotionally unavailable (overly emotional and concerned with herself) so I didn't receive the emotional support I needed and learned to do what she wanted in order to get what little emotional support she had to give. I always felt like I had to compete with my brother for attention and so I feared rejection and was afraid that I wouldn't get the emotional support that I needed. I didn't have a stage to express myself in an honest way because I was always competing with my brother for attention so I did what I thought my mom wanted to see.   

  
  I was always spoiled and later in life I would form very close emotional attachments with my parents and my brother as well so was still capable of forming deep connections with other people. I terrorized my family in an attempt to find social acceptance. I drank to feel good but I drank to be able to connect to others better, I never heard no, even if I was told no. I kept going, never wanting to change and using alcohol to feel good and get past my insecurities in order to form bonds with people. It worked. Until it didn't.  

   
  Over and over I would black out and get into trouble up until pretty recently actually. I was violent mean, cruel even. I didn't care or even notice. I thought this was the right thing to do until I'd black out and see the destruction. This made the environment at home unlivable. You would never know what mood I was in or what I was going to destroy, when I was going to randomly freak out during a blackout.

I used to travel for work weekly in my 20s and nothing went together better than bars, crappy food, and hotel rooms. This is really when I began to drink a lot and probably peaked as well. I would sit in a hotel room on the weekends and go through a 5th pass out wake up and keep going... Fast forward to now, I don't drink anything close to that, I can also pretty easily go weeks without drinking. The 1 month mark is usually where I buckle and have a light bender. When I'm sober for those weeks I feel ""in the groove"". I'm doing better at work, the home, physically. But there's always that need to work hard/play hard and I'm constantly needing that rush of an ice cold beer.. then 2... then 3... then it's not about a refreshing beer. It's about getting drunk. I see my Dr. every 3 months and have full bloodwork done because I am on TRT. Liver enzymes are always in check because I stop drinking 2 weeks prior to blood work... Not wanting to get in trouble with the dr. The problem is day after blood work it's drinking time! I've never truly been able to be my 110% because of my drinking. I also workout daily and am for the most part fit, but I can never lose the remaining belly because of booze. Ok enough rambling...Long story short, if I never craved alcohol again that would be amazing and it doesn't scare me that I need alcohol to have fun. I know I feel great without it. But I also know that something inside my head will not let me just have a couple drinks or quit completely for the rest of my life. I've been to AA and honestly the religious aspect and meetings were just not for me. I came across the Sinclair Method and was immediately intrigued. I know the reason I drink is because I love that endorphin rush. And most of the post I've read on here have had good results. The idea that I could take a pill prior to drinking that will diminish that rush sounds amazing. Now I also read that tracking and counseling are a big part of that. So where does one start? Should I ask my Primary Care first and have him refer me? Are there any online services (telemed)? And lastly, this is a weird question, but would this have an effect on getting a life insurance policy in the future... Would I be considered a substance abuser and be denied a policy?

I recently quit drinking. I ended up losing my last job by showing up drunk. Then, I increased my consumption and ended up practically bedridden and lost about 30 pounds (I'm very short, and I was in decent shape). My muscles deteriorated to the point where I needed help walking. Well, I've finally started eating regular meals without throwing them up, I've gained about fifteen pounds back, and I'm working out as much as I can (which isn't much), but I can at least make it through running errands and shopping. I've been taking vitamins and trying to diversify my diet, while also listening to cravings and packing as many calories as I can in a day. I start working a new job tomorrow, and that means filling out paperwork. The problem is that the shakes hit me pretty hard, to the point that I can barely sign my name. I also get more shaky when I'm nervous or even slightly cold. I've always been a little shaky even before falling into alcoholism, but withdrawal has pushed it to the extreme. So, I'm happy that I'll be back to work, but I am dreading filling out forms. Do you guys have any tips to manage the shakes?",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988207221031189}"

In the past few weeks, my aunt has supplying my GP with one beer a day to keep him satisfied, since trying to get him to go sober is like poking a beehive, especially in such a stressful situation. 

My mom went to go clean the fridge out of my GP’s decimated trailer so that when it came time to clean the place, the rancid food didn’t smell so bad. She noticed that there were beers in the fridge and on a nightstand, which means my grandmother (GM) has been knowingly supplying him alcohol since before the storm (even though this has been an ongoing thing to get him sober). 

As he’s been staying at my aunt’s house, every day he’s been yelling for more and even tried to sneak off to the store to buy more beer. My aunt found out my GM was sneaking him extra beers in the evening and enabling his behavior. 

My mom said that when they come back home, they’ll be welcome to stay with her. She’ll even let him drink as long as he doesn’t drive (which he has been known to do). I reminded her that she’ll have to lock up her own liquor cabinet, medicine cabinet, and car keys. 

I’m so worried. I know you can’t make him quit unless he wants to, and he doesn’t. But this doesn’t seem like a way to manage it. He gets so angry when he’s drunk and angry when he can’t get what he wants.

Same thing usually. I buy five 99 shooters and sip on them throughout the day/night. I don’t down them. And I drink them because they’re cheap and have less sugar, carbs, and calories and I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and didn’t want all that unnecessary weight gain. Though this past month I haven’t trained at all. 

Well. Yesterday, I went the bulk of the day without drinking. I started getting very light headed. Awful anxiety. Off and on headache. Minor panic attacks. And.. not really blurred vision, I could see fine, but my eyes felt weird and it almost felt like I was high. 

Ugh. Wow. I was terrified. I always tried to deny I was pretty alcohol dependent but this just proved me wrong. Not to mention I did the bad thing and googled my symptoms. Google of course told me I had cancer, AIDS, the flu, a cold, hep c. And every other relatable thing that went ahead with my symptoms. 

Come night time, still doing awful. And I can’t fall asleep. I start getting night sweats and thought someone was trying to come in my room at one point. Just awful all around. 7hrs of barely off and on sleep until I finally just gave up. 

Today I puked. And considering I don’t have a fever, I had a feeling it may be withdrawals. 

Sure enough I look up withdrawal symptoms and I fit almost every single one. 

I’m hoping this is the last post I’ll have to make. I’m done drinking. I did it often to cope with my depression but it usually only actually made it worse. Or I’d say, “well food tastes better when I drink” and I’d drink before I ate. 

Withdrawals suck. I don’t want to eventually die from this crap. I’m only 28. I already have GERD.

2021-09-11 04:31:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/pm3osm/family_issues/,Family Issues,"Hey everyone,

To be clear from the start, I am 21, male, and personally have no issues with alcohol. I do not consume it even though I have an abundance of excellent bottles and various glassware - I feel really great being sober. This is something I think I got as a value from my family (which is well known and quite public), where my parents were too busy working to indulge themselves into poisonous activities.

I have a girlfriend my age and we’ve been together for around 5 years now, making our bond quite strong. For a long time I couldn’t imagine my life without her presence as she grew to be my best friend, caring partner, and a wonderful lover.

Unfortunately, at some point (2-3 years into our friendship) I have discovered that her parents are strongly affected by alcohol use. I have discovered that this has been a big issue for my GF, who has been comparing her family to mine. It drains the life-juice out of her, when she realizes that parents were drinking again. And of course, this has a strong mental backlash on me, as I absorb all that energy when letting my GF to talk it out. 

Recently, it has come to a point where her mother called me and my parents while being under the influence, mumbled some nonsense and then dropped the phone off. Since then I feel some sort of lofty vibe coming from my family when we talk about my GF. I feel like they are ashamed of her and her family and wish me something better to choose as a companion for life. And honestly, I’ve starting to feel the similar way as well, as there is very little I gain in this situation. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about ending my relationships with that family for some months lately and these thoughts make me painfully anxious as I feel trapped in my own head. Cutting my GF off because all of this feels like a betrayal to me, feels very egotistical and self-centered. I feel like finding someone and creating a similar level of bond will be an issue for me. But on the other hand I feel very jealous of my friend that has a girlfriend from a respected, alcohol-related-issue-free family. I feel afraid to have kids that won’t have proper grandparent care. I feel afraid of what kind of issues my GF can have due all this stress coming from her parents. And I also feel afraid to shame myself in front of my family if GF’s parents decide to do something unexpected.

I think I’m indecisive and afraid of changes and it is the worst that one could have.

I am not seeking for advice, as there is no one other than me who should take actions and decide. I just want to make my mind straight and clear everything out, simply to avoid making a life-long mistake.

Need a bit of support","Yesterday I said that Im unhappy in our relationships. Yep this year is very, very rough on us. But I see that she drinks, don’t hold the promises and that I can’t do anything about it and it makes me sad. She denied she had any drinking problem (drinking up to a bottle wine a day, not having sex for years, denying meeting friends and drinking alone… yeah…no problem) started to say my voice makes her irritated. Yes, my tone was a bit robotic, I was detached, but I was not like angry or accusing her, just sharing. Well, I think she felt a personal boundary and THE EMOTIONAL FLOODING STARTED. Suddenly I became responsible for her being unhappy, for her drinking, she is the victim (yes, partially it’s true, Im having mental problems due to PTSD an, and she controls lots of things, true – but Im working and earning and also caring for her emotional well-being). I continued to stick to my boundary and the question. She asked “what do you ?!want”, because “if there will be no wine bottles, you’ll see how BAD our life will become THAN!!”. I did not took the guilt-trip bait and said –take some time to acknowledge it’s a problem, it’s an illness. 
 
In the end things got very heated – from her side as she felt she’s loosing control over my reactions. She was furious. She said she’s gonna throw something at me. But left the apartment. We chatted over a messenger. I asked I won’t leave her in her quest, that we botch have to change but I am not allowing her to blame shift anymore. She continued to deny the drinking problem (the problem is obvious), even denied she was screaming. I started to feel gaslighted. Like wtf, a person was just screaming at me at the top of the lungs and now says “it’s your imagination”? 

Now she says “MAYBE I’ve had enough of our relationships. You are destroying my nerve system” and is now somewhere not at home. Is it also some manipulation? Like I have to apologize? Like one anger burst and she is ready to throw away a 5-year marriage?

For context, my father (52M), had been a chronic alcoholic for the past 35 years. The longest amount of time he was sober was 2 years. Since he has been separated from my mom since I (21M) was born, I haven’t really experienced his alcoholism/was hidden from me for the longest time. I forced him to go to detox back in April after staging an intervention and flying to his hometown w/o warning, but I couldn’t stay due to school, and he relapsed about 4 weeks ago after 2 months sober. I called him out on his drunkenness but he would gaslight me and downplay his drinking habits. He started laying in bed constantly about a week ago, without getting up. Since he was heading back to said hometown, I didn’t necessarily want to ask him to go to detox here. At the same time he was drinking, he was taking medicine to treat hypertension (important later).

Yesterday morning I arrived at his house @ 6 AM to bring him to the airport. I found him incoherently blabbering with a 750 ml bottle of Smirnoff beside him. This is an amount he could drink in 1-2 nights generally. I knew I couldn’t get him to the airport at this point. This was the 3rd time he had missed his flight in a week and a half. I went home, and after he woke back up, I enlisted the help of my mom to help convince him to do detox here. He wouldn’t agree. Upon further physical examination, we noticed things I didn’t really notice before; namely dusky skin and jaundice. I took his car keys because he admitted to drunk driving and went back home after he refused. After some calls, I was referred to a law in my state where you can involuntarily commit someone for 72 hours if they’re found to be a danger to themselves. I brought this law up and the condition of my dad to my county’s mental hospital, and they agreed he fell under that law. Unfortunately law enforcement/ambulances were backed up, so they couldn’t enforce said law. I tried to make a last ditch effort at getting him to detox, but there were no beds open at any detox, and the ER had a 5 hour long wait, so I decided to wait until tomorrow.

This morning, I received a call that said they had law enforcement, an ambulance,  and a case worker to head to his place. I went immediately to his house to meet up with them. After a talk, they were able to get him to go to the ambulance w/o resistance, although I could tell he was still downplaying his condition to everyone at his place. He was transported to the hospital then admitted.

About two hours late, I received a call from him saying that his kidneys weren’t properly functioning and that he was being admitted to the ICU for a couple of days. I could tell that this wasn’t the full story. Two hours later, I received a call from the hospital saying that he was in kidney failure and being transported to the ICU. I am currently unsure if this is acute or chronic however.

While I believe I’ve done the best I realistically could’ve done in this situation, I’m having a hard time accepting that I didn’t do it too late. I’m still worried that there is much more damage to his body than just his kidneys. I’m hoping he doesn’t end up on dialysis, but if he does, I know it’ll significantly affect his lifespan and I’m not entirely sure I’m ready to lose my father.

**UPDATE (9/10/21):** Thanks for all the support guys, it means a lot.

I talked to his nurse earlier and his kidney function has been stabilized. He was moved out of the ICU and will be discharged either tonight or tomorrow. Hopefully he will be discharged to a secure detox facility under the county because he still seems to be suffering from withdrawal symptoms, then transferred to a rehab facility within his hometown. Plus, I absolutely need some distance from him after the mental torture his addiction has put me through the past few days. 

Quite frankly, he is insanely lucky that his liver, heart, kidneys, etc. aren’t more fucked yo then they were at the time of him going to the hospital. If this isn’t what gets him to finally commit to rehab and fight his addiction head on, then I honestly don’t have anything more I can really do.",23,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984660148620605}"

I will forever be the villain in the stories of so many, and from what I hear, for good cause. I've spent a great deal of time attempting to lay these demons to rest so that I may live a happy and fulfilling life. Even now, a voice freshly buried attempts to crawl to the surface as it screams and beckons to me. It wants nothing more then for me to give in to its acrimony and compunction that has long lost any sense of purpose. Evasive, it is, that to simply name it invokes a primoradial sense of discomfort. Say hello to the monster in your closet, shame! I never realized  until much later just how much time and energy I'd spent avoiding this simple yet caustic emotion. I think about how much shame and embarrassment contributed to me returning to the behavior that masqueraded so cleverly as the answer. Now I come to find that this perceived solution was the convoluted function of a variable in a very long equation.

Now, using the lens of newly acquired knowledge, and through the power of hindsight, I am able to finally locate the nexus of my addiction. At some point, I felt such an overwhelming amount of shame that I deemed myself a complete failure. I'd simply used too much white-out and it was no longer hiding my mistakes. At least not in a way I found satisfactory; I wanted to hide the mistakes, but it wasn't for anyone else. I wanted to forget, what I really wanted was to throw the whole paper away. The white-out via black-out method I had employed only worked so long as I overwrote my saved data with even worse data.  What was more was that it only allowed me to feel okay while engaging in the behavior. I simply couldn't cope with the silliest mistakes, due to my now well understood, insecure attachment style and anxiety.

Later in life I would find myself very lonely, just fired out of a dream job, I really believed I had no future prospects. I was desperate for company, and knew that knowing what I knew about myself, there was no way that was going to happen sober. I was getting trashed daily in an attempt to form a meaningful relationship with a woman, typical behavior for me. I had no standards, and asked a random girl online if she wanted to hang out. We met, she was physically deeply flawed, particularly in the dental category. Still, what she lacked in teeth she made up for with other features and personality, I'd tell myself. She had a big house, a ton of money, a big tv, she was a chef, had a dog, this was perfect. ""I will never need a job, I probably couldn't get and keep one anyway"", I'd tell myself.  I'll just pretend to like her for a while, get free shit, then I figured it would die down. Still, despite every red flag I threw at her, every misdeed, she kept moving full-steam ahead.  I kept the lie going,  I never could be the one to end things.

I'd have to be pretty drunk to trick myself into believing that I was actually enjoying her presence... On the matter of sex however, I had to be practically blacked-out. Even now, I can only actually recall having sex with her a handful of times. During all of this, I had the craziest thought, ""why don't I just marry her and keep the lie going forever, maybe it will stop being a lie"". I went against my moral compass, I even told my parents that were intensely confused but still supportive as always. Anytime they would question the relationship I'd simply tell them that I was happy and that I had finally learned to actually love her. I never course-corrected, I only picked up speed as I looked back at the now completely unrecognizable path I had taken, yup, I was lost alright. I was driven purely by ego and pleasure, only caring about myself.

At some point, I took on a new identity. I embraced all things evil. That is who and what I was, ""I am a bad person"", I said. Once I accepted this now, fact, about myself, I was in a freefall. I continued to do increasingly worse things as I used my last terrible thing to justify my next. No one said anything... no one tried to stop me. I still had everything, and due to not having to see my parents, I thought they believed my illusory happy life. My health saw steady decline, I gained 150 lbs,  my liver was starting to fail, my skin was destroyed by guttate psoriasis, I fell into an unspeakable depression...this went on for almost 2 years.

She began to take interest in someone at work, I saw it coming from a mile away, she'd  finally had enough. I asked my parents to find me a place to live. My parents already had a plan, I'd go to a rehab in California. Like a deeply-embedded parasite being baited by a raw piece of meat, I was afraid, I was angry at the world, but the thought of smoking weed by the ocean had me on a plane the next day. I lost everything in my vicinity, even the dog that had been gifted to me, that I'd called mine for 2 years. I didn't actually have ownership of anything. I settled for nothing and in return chose to live a lie so long as the alcohol and drugs kept flowing. I was sent to Awakening Recovery in  Beverly Hill's, California. Who knew such a place could exist? All of these rules were thrown at me, I was already dealing with PAW's and this was my first time trying to ""get sober"". Reality hit hard, and this brand was particularly cruel. I spent 26 days at this facility, most of my days were spent in a state of pure horror as I learned about the rules of the house. If you even take a step outside of a room without turning a light on, that's a strike. Strikes mean you have to write words, everything had a rule. Each time from 5:30AM-12AM you were doing choirs or writing words for missing a spot on the dishes. This was in an effort to teach accountability. I was stranded in California, you were not allowed to talk to your parents. I couldn't speak to them unless supervised and would not be given a cell phone or allowed a job for 6 months. I could not speak my native tongue with my parents, I tried to call my dad in the middle of the night in a panic and was punished for it. What was more is, I was being told that I was crazy, my addiction was talking, and my parents said I would not be allowed to return home. I'd have to become homeless in LA. I can still hear the pain in my dads voice as he told me this on the phone. I'd come to find out they had sent him a packet saying that I would try to go home and that I was being manipulative like I always have been. Once my stimulus check hit, it was over, like a computer being powered on. As soon as the decision had been made, I was unshackled, I took the power back and took the biggest leap of faith in my life. I was fairly certain my parents would catch me, but I really didn't know this time. If you decide to leave this facility they simply make you walk out the door and do not help you find arrangements, it's part of the program, its why people stay. People not only have no where to go but they fear their parents may really abandon them in LA out of all places. Knowing I had that stimulus money was enough for me to make the jump, even though it wouldn't realistically have covered the cost of making it back. I left, they do everything they can to start a fight with you before you go, insane. I saw someone get kicked out by the seniors there, every Wednesday, the graduates would come and ""group"" you. Pick out any mistakes you made and tear you apart. I kept trying to call my parents, they refused to speak to me. I found a hostel and really didn't know how much longer I had, I just knew for a fact I was never going back to the Awakening sober living, I would die before being subjugated to some new forms of punishment that they felt like making up.

All of this to say, my whole time in rehab has all served to teach me how absolutely batshit insane the addiction treatment industry is. Eventually, I went to another rehab that had its own set of problems, experienced a HIPAA violation and abuse of all sorts. Still, I did have one good counselor that specialized in trauma. I am a psychology major, so just learning about the therapy was really cool. In all I had over six months completely alcohol free. That is, until I made the conscious decision to drink again. I do not want to count time, this sounds like the perfect excuse to kill yourself on a relapse plus I still believe that I can drink safely and responsibly AFTER having learned everything that I have, mostly on my own. My extensive research on addiction all suggests that treatment centers are doing more harm than good, along with AA's addiction model as being the most harmful development when it comes to addiction. The way that we think about addiction is the problem, and it is all painted by an arbitrary singular brush that is the AA hive-mind. Subsequently, treatment centers think this same way. The fact of the matter is, I made a choice to give up and give in, to take advantage of people, to hurt and kill even, I did this. I have a bottle Bacardi sitting in my freezer right now, I don't want to drink it. I have had it since last Friday, I had exactly 3 shots yesterday night. Nothing less, nothing more. That is what separates those of us who can actually beat this thing and those of us that stay sick or unhappy, doubting themselves forever with the ""disease of alcoholism"".  The fact that we can not only talk about ""Accountability"" but actually engage in the act. We do not accept feelings of shame anymore. We accept that we are humans, and that we make the wrong choices, that we are selfish, that we seek pleasure at the cost of others and that humans can be exceptionally cruel but that they can also be amazing, resilient, compassionate, kind, caring, intelligent, and every other good adjective you can think of! We don't need sobriety hierarchy or other ridiculous, quite frankly intellectually insulting methods of group-thinking that takes away the power and the ability to critically think for yourself!

I hope you are all doing ok with your individual struggles and are finding success, even in the little things.

My mother is a secret drinker and probably some kind of alcoholic. Quite often, in the middle of the day she will have watery eyes, slurred speech, clears her throat all the time and is a little wobbly. This happens multiple times per week. She has been like this around my friends and my wife, and I find it really embarrassing and disappointing.

At first I thought she was on some kind of medication that had a weird side effect or interaction, but this is not the case according to my dad.

I just managed to travel home for the first time in a while, and at the airport she was definitely not sober. This was really disappointing.

I live abroad, so I don't see it all the time but my father says it happens a lot. He also finds bottles with less booze in them around the house and even a few secret stashes.

We have tried multiple times to confront her. I will admit, we are a little direct, but we try not to frame it as an attack. Things like 'we know you've been drinking' and 'you're drunk right now - why are you doing this'. It sounds harsh but we use kinder tones and we just want her to admit it.

My dad isn't really doing much about it. He is 70 now and she is in her late 60's. He says he confronts her from time to time and gets nowhere.

Therein lies one of the problems. She flat out denies it. 'No, I have not been drinking', 'I am not drunk', when she very clearly is. We get poorly-acted She doesn't acknowledge that we find the bottles, or that booze levels are down in general. She simply denies it and the conversation goes nowhere.

Right now its 12:22 in the afternoon and she's been in the kitchen with the door closed. She came to ask me something and she had watery eyes again. I can tell the difference immediately as compared to when she is actually sober. 

I know I need to approach this with kindness, but I get annoyed when she's like this. I just don't understand it, and when its so clear, we can't even talk about it. She just shuts down, walks away and that's it.

I guess my question is, based on your experiences, how do you confront a secret drinker. How can we at least take the first step for her to admit she is hiding drinks and drinking during the day?

About 3 weeks after school started, I posted again because I got suspended from school after getting caught with a flask of vodka.  I tried drinking a couple of shower beers and one on the way to school but I just needed more than that to get my work done and be half way social, which ended up in me starting to take flask with me every day.  I pretty much stayed drunk the whole time I was kicked out of school.  Dad beat my ass but he still let me drink at least.  Got laid some while I was off so it wasn’t all bad.  

Fast forward another week til today.   No problems when I went back to school.   I had been managing to keep some vodka in my car and only partake at lunch and when I got out of school.   Was leaving today and got pulled over.  Got a DUI.   Luckily was off school property.  Got handcuffed at the first intersection leaving school.  Got my car towed.  I’m 17 and that’s the last thing I needed.   I’m at home, done with my parents bitching  and finally drunk enough after an hour to myself to hopefully pass out for 12 hours.

A few months back I would drink a 750 ML bottle of liquor a day (usually gin) this lasted about 3, 4 months I was heavily dependent on it as I would feel insanely depressed anytime I was sober.

Eventually I met my current partner who made me feel happy first the first time in a long time, and I stopped drinking for about a week straight. Surprisingly I didn’t feel any withdrawals, I haven’t stopped drinking but i cut back a lot, it will now take me 2 to 3 days to drink a 750 ML bottle or 2 days for a 12 pack. I also don’t usually drink the days I work, which is 3 days a week, since I work 14 hour days I usually go to sleep after work.

From time to time I purposely stop drinking for a week or so to see if I have became physically dependent on it but I never feel any withdrawals I feel with the amount I drink I would be physically addicted, which just causes me to not stop drinking because it’s almost as if it’s not really a problem.

I know it can’t be good to drink this much but it I don’t know maybe it’s not as bad if I’m still not physically dependent on it and I’ve cut back

A few years ago I had to do a medical detox and was doing great for awhile. Covid lock downs happened and life happened and I started up again... as us alcoholics are wont to do. Started getting it under control again which to me, was only drinking once or twice a week and ""only"" a six pack or less (when I needed medical detox it was half a 750 to a full 750 a day). Shoot to June 16th, friends invited me to Vegas to a comped room (I'm in AZ. It's a quick drive) for 3 days of Vegas fun. After a 2.5 day bender I decided to cancel the last night and go home but the damage was done, i was  back to drinking often. I'd go a day maybe but most days I'd drink. Sometimes a little, other times a lot. 

Monday I finally decided I'm done done done for real this time (something a lot of us have said before, likely multiple times). Was gonna do the inpatient thing again to be safe but let's face it, I'm in America where anything like this costs your first born child. Called around and even with insurance I'm looking at 6k out of pocket. Anyway, I have diazepam for occasional anxiety and so far, at hour mark 43 I haven't had any severe withdrawals aside from occasional anxiety and the diazepam is working for those episodes and I haven't craved, I'm assuming because I'm so focused on ""winning"" this time. I know last time i got the shakes very soon after sobering up but this time feels different, it feels better although I'm still wary of what might be to come. I'm not looking for medical advice or anything but more feedback on others experiences. at the 72 hour mark are most people considered out of the weeds for severe withdrawal? Is the current benchmark of 43 hours a good sign that the remaining 29 (to get to 72) should be more or less easy street? I'm sorry I'm rambling, I'm just excited to be on this journey and confident I can beat this, this time around, provided I don't get the shakes or the fear that makes me slam a few shots to calm down.

Three years ago during his visit: He drank a lot, but not that unusually so. I just thought he was a guy who liked to party. 

Two years ago: I noticed that he drank to the point that I started to wonder if he was an alcoholic. He drank every day that I saw him during that visit. One day he drank a beer in the morning. One night he drank 14 beers. He was drinking more beer the day after he had the 14 beers. He is a jovial guy and basically bragged about how much he drank.

This year: A few times he said, almost under his breath to me, ""God. I need to stop drinking."" But it was like he said it as a joke. He also said his heart raced in the morning when he gets up becasue he drank so much. He drank every day that I saw him. One night he drank at least 6 or 7 hard liquor drinks at a restaurant. He also talked about drinking a lot. What he drank and how much he drank and other people that drank a lot were centerpieces of almost every story he told. He is still a jovial guy and comes across as a healthy fit guy who just likes to party.

Other then the booze, he seems to be in great health. He actually works out very hard almost every day. Does a ton of cardio. He also appears to be good at his job. He wakes up early every day. And when he is not drinking I believe he works around the house, studies for career advancement, and is otherwise active.

My sisters is in recovery. She is a shining example of a recovering addict. She even works in the recovery community full time. Everyone looks up to her and she should be proud as she has come a long way. All throughout our childhood as far back as I can remember she was without a doubt emotionally abusive to me and on occasion physically abusive-attempting to strangle me and then stopping herself and then minimizing it. I have major self esteem issues and negative self talk habits as a result and even entered an abusive marriage with an alcoholic (didn’t realize these things when I married them) as an adult which I believe felt familiar to this childhood abuse where I was constantly told to overlook the abuse by adults because she was my sister who loved me. I learned to accept abuse as love which is totally toxic. She put me down on a daily basis and took great pleasure in seeing me in emotional pain. She had extreme jealously issues of mine and my moms closeness to the point that I didn’t like to show affection towards my mom in front of her out of fear of how she would react. As adults I’ve learned to detach and not take the things she says personally but it is still a strained relationship and one where I do feel I walk on egg shells. As such I try to keep my distance but be loving when I see her.  as a shining star in the recovery community it’s a little disappointing she has never tried to make amends to me and she’s been clean for almost a decade. I don’t get upset about this as I know I can’t control her, only myself and I have to chose not to care as this is her personal journey but I’m just curious if anyone has ever dealt with this? I do wish she would own her actions say sorry and then we could rebuild our relationship for real but I feel like that day will never come because even clean she always views herself as the victim. She is never at fault and when she is she makes light of it and it becomes a joke. It feels like because people get clean everyone pats them on the back and adopts a the past is the past mentality, but I was severely damaged by this person before they even started using drugs.

For the past 2 1/2 years I have basically drank every single day. Some days more than others. This all started when I convinced myself that I had cancer and I developed a panic disorder, and got stalked by three people at the same time. The main reason why I started drinking was because I wanted to feel normal and stop thinking about my health 24 seven. Like an endless loop in my head that never ended and the only thing that stopped these thoughts was the drinking or at least made me feel normal. The problem is, is that this Health scare it was two years ago. I was so attached to the way drinking made me feel after that but I would drink when I was happy, sad, anxious. I needed any reason to drink. There’s this new thing now that has been going on for half a year that I have severe panic attacks if I go far away from my house unless I drink. If I don’t drink and leave the house, I’ll start to sweat, I’ll start shaking, I feel numb like I’m not real and then I start to convince myself that I’m either going to faint, die or go completely insane. The only way I could be normal and leave the house is if I at least have two beers and then I continue into the night and end up having six or seven a night. It really depends on the night but I never usually have less than four beers a night but I never surpass eight. The average amount of drinks I have a day I would say is 5 1/2 or six. I drink Bud Light seltzer, basically I drink white girl drinks LMFAO I don’t drink like hard liquor or anything like that. I did go through a very hard time last year as well in a very toxic relationship that really contributed to my OCD and panic attacks. And that’s when the drinking really got out of control during that hard time for me. Now I’m in a happy relationship and yet I still find myself drinking six beers a night and the thought of stopping makes me feel like I have nothing to look forward to besides my relationship. I try to be happy about the little things but then my OCD convinces my brain that I’m not actually happy and that nothing will make me happy. I don’t have thoughts like that when I drink, I feel happy about my life. My question really is, am I actually an alcoholic? My boyfriend is saying that if I don’t quit this or at least cut it down to three drinking days a week he doesn’t want to be with me anymore which is really putting a lot of pressure on me and scaring the shit out of me. Someone please give me advice. I want to be able to leave the house sober and not convince myself that I’ll have a panic attack or that I need to have a drink to feel calm. I want to be able to go to sleep at night and not have to drink to call me down enough to sleep. And the thought that this could be ruining my health is really freaking me out as well. I know there are people that drink like a bottle of Vaca a day and that this is not really like the worst thing that you have probably read on Reddit about alcoholism but is my drinking really that bad compared to other people? Am I really an alcoholic?Someone please help me.

Also, I do plan on quitting but I’m afraid that if I quit I’ll end up having seizures or something really bad will happen and then I’ll go into serious withdrawal. I’m terrified of hallucinations and shit like that. Well drinking six beers a night for like two years do that to you or is it not enough to really cause severe withdrawal. I don’t think I’m a severe heavy drinker. I don’t black out and honestly I don’t even get drunk at this point I just feel calm.

He's going through a hard time now and from what I've heard he has been drinking A LOT. He ended up in the hospital twice because he was shaking. He's also depressed.


My mum wants all of us to try to convince him to go to rehab again but I doubt this would work. Quitting an addiction isn't easy. I'm a smoker and every time people tell me to quit it just annoys the heck out of me because it's not about the ciggaretes, it's about the way they make me feel - they calm me down.

**Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism**

Hi, 

My name is Saul Celere, and I'm an alcoholic. I'm happy to say that I haven't had a drink since the 1st of January this year, and I'm optimistic about my sober future.

I am also a philosopher and a theoretical physicist. My education was heavily scientific, and like a lot of people in the modern world, I view existence and our Universe logically and scientifically.

Over the last few decades something of a scientific consensus has been reached concluding that God does not exist; not all scientists are atheists, but most of them are, and if you ask a lot of modern people why they don't believe in God, they’re likely to tell you that science proves such ideas untrue.

Until five or six years ago I was a member of this consensus. I thought of myself as a 99% atheist; I wasn't willing to say with 100% certainty there was no God, indeed, to make such a claim would require a God-like knowledge and understanding of existence and our Universe, otherwise, you might be wrong. But I was pretty much convinced.

This conviction of atheism prevented me from using the concept of a “Higher Power” whenever I would try to stop drinking; as soon as I heard any talk of a Higher Power, I would immediately, if privately, dismiss it as nonsense.

But Socrates has been my hero since I was a kid, and he said “Wisest is he who knows he knows nothing”. Well, thank God for Socrates and my 1% of doubt, because five or six years ago I had some scientific insights into the nature of Consciousness that cleaved open this doubt to reveal a new, expanded and very optimistic conceptual picture of our Universe and our connection to It.

Both God and the Human Soul, if they exist, are conscious entities, therefore, any new understanding of Consciousness can, at any time, alter or expand our understanding of God and how we relate to ... + Him+Her + ... ( God is much more than just male )

The scientific insights I had quickly led me to developing a very new and revolutionary, but rigorously scientific, conceptual picture of the Universe in which we live, and move, and have our being.

This has entailed me writing The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness. These principles have general applicability to all conscious systems, just like Newton’s Principles of Motion can be generally applied to all macroscopic dynamical systems. 

These Principles finally allow us to construct theoretical models of conscious entities and systems, such as the human nervous system. And, maybe more importantly, they can also be used to construct the first scientific, theoretical models of both The Mind of The Universe ( read Higher Power, God ), as well as the physical Human Soul.

These models are the means by which a resolutely scientific mind, such as my own, can find the concept of a Higher Power a plausible scientific reality. And, for me, finding a Higher Power genuinely, and logically, and scientifically plausible was absolutely essential to getting sober.

For the first time in my life I felt like I might be able to trust my Universe, that maybe my coming into existence wasn't actually a terrible, terrifying mistake, maybe I hadn't been born into a cold, dead, unfeeling, uncaring Universe, that I was totally separate from. 

Until then, I had conceived of my existence as a brief anomaly of personal Consciousness that would be followed, inexorably, by an eternity of total non-existence, and in retrospect I see how this conception of my existence undermined me as an inescapably moral and spiritual being.

But now God had become possible, and not just possible, but plausible, and even more plausible than no God. After three decades of atheism, this was the hell of a shock!!!  An “I need to lie down and breathe into a brown paper bag” kind of shock! And awe, lots of awe. Awe is quite like fear except it's a good thing, thrilling.

I'd been very unhappy for a very long time and I knew that my drinking was making my life worse and damaging my most meaningful relationships. But life was meaningless, pointless; whether I stopped drinking or not, whether I wound up with a family and friends, or completely alone, my own Universe was still going to eternally annihilate me.

The possibility of a Higher Power suggested the possibility of meaning and hope, meaning and hope that wasn't limited to just this one life I was making a mess of. So, I decided to conduct an experiment, an existential experiment, an experiment with my own existence, in which I was both the scientist and the rat.

I asked myself, “If a Higher Power does exist, what would … + He + She + … advise me to do, and, very importantly, what not to do?” 

Top of the list was to stop drinking, and to really stop. And if I managed to stop for a few weeks, to stay stopped once I inevitably started whispering sweet nothings to myself about “Well, we can have one or two, just on the weekend, with my girl, that's ok…”

I can't say the experiment was a success because it's still going on. I had thought if I were to ever find God it would mean automatic, perennial happiness. In reality it has required me to work harder than I've ever worked in my life. But as I keep up the experiment I can't deny that I am happier than I was. 

The happiness is like when we used to roll a small snowball into an enormous “snowwheel” when we were kids; it gets bigger slowly, imperceptibly, and I have to keep pushing, but it's much more pleasant to be a happy Sisyphus halfway up the mountain, than a sad Sisyphus motionless at the bottom, paralyzed by his own nihilism.

Faith in a Higher Power made me realise my happiness is intimately related to my morality; that I will never be happy as long as I'm not making a concerted effort at self improvement, an effort that I don't abandon every time I get too stressed or have an argument with my girlfriend.

The more seriously I take my moral health the better my life becomes. ( Slowly, and it's hard, and it still regularly shocks me how hard it is; if I were to ever meet God, and assuming I didn't immediately go for His throat, I'd say “All this, the Universe, existence, the stars, Earth, the plants and animals, Humanity etc., it's all amazing, but you've put the emotional, psychological, difficulty level up way too high! ) 

Anyway, all of this began with me finding God a plausible scientific reality, so, I wanted to help anyone who is finding it difficult to reconcile a modern scientific understanding of our Universe with faith in a Higher Power.

Here is a lecture/podcast called “Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction” in which I explain what Principia Theologica is:

[Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction](https://youtu.be/8NQJQN0D9A4)

In the description is a link to episode 1 of around 12 episodes of Principia Theologica, in which I outline a rigorously scientific approach to the Higher Power. If the picture of our existence painted by the modern interpretation of science depresses or scares you, there is great hope and relief to be found in these philosophical ideas and the truth about our physico-conscious being.

Best of luck on your journey!!!

Sincelerely,

I have never been much on the booze subreddits, this account is mainly for drug posting and advice. I give a lot of advice nowadays, having made it out of multiple simultaneous addictions (Benzos, heroin, alcohol). I have looked at r/cripplingalcoholism and it seems the difference is, over there it's more like a support group for active drunks, where here, its former drinkers and folks looking to get better? Please tell me if this is the wrong subreddit. 

Anyways, I started on liquor. I was a true alcoholic as a teen. By 12 I tried to get it whenever I could, I thought it made me even smarter and who I wanted to be. By 15 I was drinking a pint a day on weekdays and more on weekends, had a rotation of three adult losers willing to sponsor my alcoholism, and it was mostly free, too, didn't even pay them most times. 

It was bad. I was about to quit at 17 when booze withdrawals gave me my first panic attacks, but my house burned down right after Christmas '14. I might have been able to handle this, the loss of ALL my hundreds of records many of which I will never find again, my guitars, my life. I saved my huge, disabled step-grandpa with my mother who's smaller than me (I'm a small guy) while my dad saved only his wallet and vodka and went safely out the back. 

I might have been able to deal with this, but at the hotel, for the next two days, my dad drunk himself into delirium, and he heavily verbally abused my mother and I for hours and hours. The next time I left the hotel was the first time I smoked heroin, predicated by a handful of hydrocodone and triazolam pills and a swig of liquor. 

(Complete side note, not telling people this works so DON'T DO IT THIS ISN'T ADVICE: This sounds crazy, but after the hit of heroin...my alcoholism's severity went the fuck away. Granted, it was replaced with an opioid addiction but even after quitting the  drugs, I never had that insane ""NEED"" for booze. When I was 16, my worst torture would be to lock me in a room with one single beer. I would go insane, I couldn't stop at one. Now, I'd be slightly annoyed, but I could deal just fine. )

Anyways, after all this ended and I realized I could not keep up the insanity of drinking and benzos and heroin, I quit it all, but in the same way a smoker has an oral fixation, I...still like drinks. 

What's the answer to that? I like Lambic...a beer that  is practically non-alcoholic at 1-2% per 750ml bottle, but that's almost 12 bucks a bottle. Non-alcoholic beer? Gross!

I liked the taste of bitter herbs, juniper, etc... Gin with orange liqueur and bitters was my ideal drink, maybe throw some Absinthe in there, too... but I absolutely cannot have hard liquor again, ever. I can make a ""mixed drink"" out of a Truly or a White Claw and bitters, which is WAY better than having liquor, but...can't be drinking beer every day, and one can turn into two or three easily. 

So, what do I do for ""guilt free drinks""? I buy sparkling water of various flavors, cherry, raspberry, whatever...and then I buy bitters, good bitters, some Peychaud's or Scrappy's and go ""One, two, three"" taps into a drink glass, fill 'er up with sparkling water, and there you go, a flavorful non-booze beverage. This may be too much for some people, the temptation, but it may help others, so just throwing it out there. Been using lavender, orange, rose bitters... wonderful stuff. 

Also, you can't drink the bitters, well, you can, but you'll have a horrible stomachache and throw up, so, don't even try! It's a good deterrent, if you can handle this sort of thing.

I'm not hurting anyone but myself, but that should be enough for me. 

I've cut back several times in the past. At one point I even cut back to the point where I was hardly drinking at all. It was still every night. But it was one or two drinks, then nothing. 

I'm in a place now where I'm getting all the red flags that this is going to seriously affect my health. Right now I don't feel like quitting entirely is an option. Frankly, I'm a little worried that going cold-turkey will have a negative outcome. 

So looking for some strategies that have worked for others in ""harm reduction,"" as my therapist calls it. What worked for you? Were you able to make it long-term? My hope is to reduce the drinking overall before finally taking the plunge and walking away from it entirely.

At first I told myself I can quit whenever I want but I clearly haven't. I think the longest I went was a week. I drink at least a bottle of white wine a night. Its not only expensive but I keep fearing for my health. I also gained a lot of weight as a result.

I really want to get healthy and stop. I still am in denial that I'm an Alcoholic because I don't feel like my life depends on it and I only drink at night. I drink mainly because of anxiety but lately I feel anxious as I drink, I think it's guilt and I don't even get properly drunk. I have a headache, a small buzz and a hangover the next day as well as guilt and self hatred for not being able to stop.

I don't really see the benefit as in feeling relaxed or cheerful but I still drink I think it's because I want that high but probably my body is too used. If I drink more than I do I get bad headache and feel sick so a wine bottle is my limit (I know that's a lot of Alcohol tbh).

I just really need encouragement to stop, I want to feel in control of drinking. I want it to be fun again, which is stupid because its the worst part of my life. I think I'm starting to realise that I don't have the ability to stop and it makes me sad that I probably need to go t total for life because I feel like the alcohol is in control of me and not the other way round. I'm sure if allow myself to think it's an option I go back it once I stop. So I told myself to try quit until the end of the year so it feels less permanent and impossible. 

I'm scared of failing or getting sick (liver, kidneys cancer etc) but the idea of quitting makes me feel a bit a loss.

Help.,"We've been together 5 1/2 years, and are very happy together. We meal prep, both work, spend time together, rarely fight. Our life is very normal and happy.

Except for this one thing.

My boyfriend who meditates, works out, studies health science... is an alcoholic. He doesn't know why. I don't know why. We're both scared and tired of having fights over it.

Last October, I came home from college classes to find him incoherent. His eyes were rolling in his head, he was slurring his speech, and barely keeping up with conversation. I kept asking what was wrong because I was very worried. He finally tells me he ""smoked a little weed"". 

At dinner time, I cook, and he goes to the bathroom to throw up. I assume he's sick. He's gone for the next 30 minutes. When I go to check on him, there's no answer. He has a fainting disorder so I immediately assume he fell in the bathroom and hit his head. Terrified, I run to get his mother (we live with his parents). She bangs on the door, and when we can't get it open, she gets an ax to break it down. Then he answers the door. He fesses up to us that he had ""some wine"" and passed out. 

We didn't have any wine. When his parents leave, he shows me his liquor stash. I was VERY shocked.

Over the past year, these random blackout sessions have happened again. Sometimes when we have guests over, and we've had to end parties early due to his drunkenness, as he got in the pool with all his clothes on. I've tried to ask his parents for help, and he is their 'golden child' so they keep gaslighting me and telling me he doesn't have a problem and I'm embarrassing them by trying to talk to them about this. I can't tell anyone else. I've never had an addict in my life, so I don't know what to do. Even if I tossed all our alcohol, he could still drink behind my back when I'm away.

He's not a mean drunk. He's not a violent one, or a driving one, or a depressed one. He's just bored and probably a little overworked and drinks to incoherence, then drunkenly lies to me about it. Last night, it happened again. He lied to me about it, then fessed up after we fought for 45 minutes that he had had ""too many drinks to count"". He promised me that he wouldn't lie to me about it again, as I tried to reassure him I'm on his side and I want to help him get out of this. And he's going to try to find a therapist today.

But what do I do? What do I say, or offer, or take away? It's been a year and I'm so emotionally exhausted with this cycle, and I know he is too.

In June, I had a massive breakdown, ended up on medication for anxiety, and have been mostly sober since. Honestly it probably saved my life in a lot of ways. 

I have to go to a family wedding in a month. They’re not a very supportive group of people and everyone drinks heavily - that’s kind of the social expectation with them.

it started  years ago. at thirteen, i had my first drink. it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers. i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast. it fucked me up. i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good. after that, i stopped drinking for 2 years because i was scared of alcohol. i didnt want to get fucked up again. but at 15 i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and...needless to say, i went overboard and blacked out. i needed it to have fun. 

thats when it began. it started with just drinking with friends, then with the family, then on my own in my room. actually, i'm drinking right now in my room while i write this. i drink about 3-5 shots of vodka 3-4 times a week. i even find myself thinking about drinking if i'm sad. i do it at night alone in my room...it helps me sleep. if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep.

you might be wondering---how can you afford all that booze?

well, my dad owns a bar in our backyard. i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka. my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice. i have a stash in my room. one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just...make a trip to the bar. 

its either big or go home when i drink. i dont have a limit. i'll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick. 

i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy (went a few years ago because of a family issue) but no diagnosis came out of that. but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety--i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious.

anyway, i wanna talk to someone about this. i dont see many teenager alcholics.

2) I have some baclofen form an older injury... I read in some journals, it can help with alcohol withdrawal.  Muscle relaxant I guess, and can possible stavbe off tremors and seizures?  I've for around 30 of these 10mg.

3) I have a friend on the internet telling me that phenibut is related to the baflofen and also useful against alcohol withdrawls.

And just so you guys know, I'm not looking for a buzz.  I'm looking to be comfortable until my brain gets used to not being soaked in alcohol, and then trying to get into a normal life.

This is day 8 alcohol free for me which is a lot of sober days in my book. I voluntarily checked myself into the hospital 9 days ago and spent a few days being treated through the withdrawals and I haven't touched it sense. Before it always felt like a chore the few times I stopped drinking but something is vastly different now. 

For me it finally took my son telling me they don't like seeing me drink everyday and that even when I'm present, I'm not really there. That was a major eye opener for me. My relationship with my girlfriend was also crumbling at this time and I finally got it. I finally woke up and saw that even though I would go to work and pay my bills while drinking everyday, I wasn't truly in control, my life had become unmanageable and I finally was able to understand what that actually meant. I was self serving. Alcohol was my closest love, robbing me of the time and energy I should have been devoting to those I love and whom love me back, those I treated like an afterthought.

At this moment I am homeless during the hottest summer I have ever experienced, left the town I was living in and may not be able to transfer the decent paying job I had. No vehicle and no license thanks to seizure disorder and no room in the shelter. But I don't even mind that much honestly. Something in my mind has changed, I just seem to accept that things will happen now and I won't always be able to change them but I can always change how I think about them. I'm so excited to rebuild a future that includes all the people I care about and a healthy life style. I finally have goals again. A purpose. 

I just wanted to toot my horn a little to someone who gets it and thank the members of this sub for their stories and encouragement. Out of all of the sub reddits devoted to alcohol I read this one the most when I was preparing to step off the merry-go-round.

I know we cannot give medical advice on this sub but I was just wondering if someone has had a similar experience because I have had high anxiety all week due to my health being possibly compromised from my last binge.

23F. Been drinking since 18. Been binge drinking since 21. Since my last binge 5 days ago, i have decided to quit drinking for good. Regardless of the health symptoms I've been feeling since then, that night was awful and i never want to live through that again. I probably could have died.
When I stopped binging on Sunday, I was drinking about 10-13 shots worth of alcohol 2x a week or the equivalent to a bottle and a 1/2 to 2 bottles of wine 2x a week. Luckily I was never physically dependent on alcohol and i haven't been getting cravings or anything, but I am now scared for my health.

Since my binge sunday, I have been experiencing upper abdominal pain (usually contained to the right side), lower abdominal pain the form of cramping. Upper and lower back pain which has been scaring me into thinking i may have damaged my kidneys, and also I have been pooping yellow, greasy, runny stools  I am obviously not diagnosing myself with anything and will be going to a doctor soon, but I am most concerned about my kidneys and pancreas. 

I want to know if someone has gone through anything similar and I would really like some moral support due to my high anxiety. It won't be easy to come clean with mh doctor, but I have no choice.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971804618835449}"

I don’t drink liquors or wine much, I burn through a few six packs of that fancy IPA, you know the 8% and up, daily… 

I would be waiting out front the liquor store 8am waiting for it to open like a fucking weirdo. Other drunks and hobos, really haggard people who’ve destroyed there bodies and ruined their looks. I am fortunate that I am not in that shape, I what the hell am I loitering with these guys… I would do even weirder shit, antisocial shit. Sometimes on a semi-blackout bender I would find myself hanging down by the east river drinking with the hobo staring at the city, what the fuck were we talking about, whatever I don’t remember, prolly just some weird hobo shit… I do recall them referring to their little posse as “the river people.”

Lots of home alone drankin’ as you don’t want friends or girlfriends to know the true extent. I would start out at the bar and have just a few, and then go continue on my own, I didn’t even want the friggin’ bar tender to see it. It’s ruined relationships and estranged a few friends.

I was always really good at office happy hour back when that was still a thing before pandemic. I would basically just do the above description, have a few, get out and then really get down to business. 

As  the demon progressed over time and became stronger, so did withdrawals. Would kick in about 10:30ish am, I would be at my desk as it crept up. Nauseous, beginning to sweat and disoriented. Staring at my email unable to make sense of anything, or compose a response. Got a meeting in two hours, I will look so crazy by then, perhaps I could go in there and puke orange bile until empty and just dry heaving all day, I can also spray diarrhea on the white board for good measure. Alrighty only one way to fix this! Ok so now the morning routine… Step 1: go to bodega pick out IPAs and then a tall boy of something weaker to chase. Step 2: find an alley, I had my own special alley where there was no chance of colleague walking by or something. That would be a weird ass scene, me standing there chugging a bottle of beer while holding a second one in my other hand w tall boy tucked under my arm, what the fuck would I even say, weird! Ok, so now I feel normal again Yay! Now to hurry back an brush my teeth w a swig of listerine.

Fast forward… Came off a bender just the other day and have been on a strict taper plan, for a bit. I have been using shitty Coors lite for this purpose, super low alcohol content and it tastes like shit, ideal. Early in the process I would get two strong ones to start ad then couple sixes of the piss water, whittled it down to one IPA to start and just several of the piss water.

It was pretty bad for a few days, the hangover and withdrawal symptoms kick in. Was camped out on the couch w comforter and many pillows, lots of Gatorade and water water water. I am past the stage where I would immediately vomit any water I would attempt to drink, it would actually still be cold as it came back out. The worst is over, administering can of pisswater every 3-4 hours now, finally able to snack again, weed helped w appetite an nausea…  my thoughts are clearing up, and will only get better. The chills and sweats seem to be over. Now if I could actually get sleep… I can’t wait to shit normal again, goddam Hearshy squirts ruining my life. 

I almost have no craving.  I need to find new things to fill in that time I’d spend fucked up.

Dont get me wrong i am so grateful and happy to no longer be drinking. But i think its foolish to pretend everyday is fucking amazing. Today i woke up from a nice dreamless sleep and i felt it, the joy of looking forward to a new year in which i will be sober, yesterday i was saying goodbye to the first year i spent sober. I guess i was feeling a little melancholy. Not because im not enjoying my sober time but because because it has been hard. Of course it has, its a big step, its all those things i have been pushing down coming up, its all my traumas asking to finally be seen and dealt with. It has been fucking hard, the pink cloud is gone. Whats not gone is the promise of a somewhat emotional stability, the promise of time, the promise of intuition.

2021-09-01 21:22:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/pg7nil/my_story/,My Story,"Hello all. I’ve recently joined this group and have dipped my toes in some of the comments. Wanted to share my story just to get it out there and maybe even help someone along the way?

In high school and college I was never a big drinker, always liked pot better. Not to say I didn’t drink but nothing beyond a couple times a month. I never really craved alcohol or gave it a second thought when I wasn’t out amongst friends.

As I got older I started to enjoy beer more and more. A self described beer snob who loved his IPAs. I would drink mostly weekends and by that time I was engaged so most of the time I was with my fiancé. After our wedding it started more regularly during the week after work. The old stress reliever after a tough day at the office I need to relax and put back a few. At the time I didn’t see it as a problem but gradually started to think maybe I am over doing it putting back a six pack every afternoon on the weekend. Still it didn’t bother me I was at home, not the bar, not endangering anyone one.

Fast forward to 2015 and my wife was pregnant with our first daughter. She has seen his gradually in has become dependent. She was always the DD by that point not only because she couldn’t drink (which she rarely does regardless) but also because I always had to drink if we were out. With the impending birth of daughter she implored me to stop drinking or at least for a while. That lasted all of a week. I promised I wouldn’t get as drunk as normal especially with a baby in the house. I did do that to a certain extent but then it just led to the hiding game. Lying about his much I drank and hiding beer regularly in my trunk. Soon it turned to having 3 beers to get a buzz on when I woke up before anyone else was. Then it started at work. Drinking on my lunch break and if I was working late sneaking out to my car for a drink. I world even drink in the way home literally with a bottle in my cup holder. So many times I was definitely to drunk to drive several times on my way home from the office at 5 pm.

Eventually came ultimatum time. My hand was forced I had to get help. Let me tell you if you’re not ready to quit you won’t. I started seeing an addiction therapist with my wife. It went well but I still wasn’t ready. New Years 2018 I told my wife I was quitting. It lasted all of a few weeks. The one thing it did accomplish was I no longer drank at home. She was under the impression I was sober. I would head to wegmans across the street everyday on my lunch break and by usually a six pack or a 4 pack of pounders. IPA of course and the higher ABV the better. I would be able to finish off 3 beers of the six pack or two and a half pounders. I would then return to work and brush and floss and always had gum on the ready.

November 2019 I wasn’t feeling well so I s as stayed home. Thought it might be the flu went to urgent care and tested negative. The dr gave me a prescription for one of the flu meds don’t remember which one. I started taking it one of the side effects was it discolored your urine. I started to think geez imagine what my liver and kidneys are like. When something health wise happened I was bound to have to tell my wife and she would know I was lying the whole time.  By that time we were expecting baby number 2 in January 2020. At that point something just clicked. I knew I was done.

Due to my drinking I wasn’t truly there for my first daughter for the first year and a half. Physically I was but you’re not much help when you’re wasted half the time, although my high tolerance did help me do the bare minimum. After I quit drinking at home it helped as I was only getting buzzed at work. November 8th 2019 was my last drink. I vowed to be fully present for my second daughter day one. She was born January 3rd 2020. The first month sober was tough mentally but not as much physically as I really had no withdrawal symptoms. Throughout the time I was still drinking I continued to see my therapist and since I have truly stopped. I was never able to tell them or my wife I lived a lie for that first year and a half “sober”. I think of it as my little lie and I doubt plan on telling my wife(I know sounds bad). She’s already dealt with my lies enough over the past 9 years. I never thought I could have fun or enjoy life without drinking but I can truly say that’s not the case. I have never felt better physically or mentally in my life(with the correct anxiety meds which are definitely a big part).

The past few years have been rough for me. I always told myself I never had a drinking problem because “I don’t drink in the morning” or “I only drink on weekend or special occasions” or “it’s summer, I want to let loose”. But oh boy when I do drink, I 1. don’t know when it’s time to call it so I’m drinking until 4 or 5 in the morning and 2. do totally destructive things like wake up my sleeping boyfriend just to fight with him, run out of the house in the middle of the night with no shoes yelling and crying, messaging an old friend asking to join their singing group, to name a few incidents in recent memory. Things have been worse because of the pandemic, because I’m not working, so what does it matter if I’m hung over the next day. 

Every time I drink, I always overdo it and I wake up the next day absolutely mortified and disgusted in my behaviour, and have to do the apology tour. My boyfriend is so kind and understanding, but I imagine he’s even getting tired of it. 

Until I checked out everyone’s stories here, I honestly thought I was just an insane monster, someone who is too mentally unwell to control their alcohol, and sometimes I would over drink just to try and prove to myself I can control it just like everyone else (only to do something stupid or shameful and beat myself up for it for a week) 

So anyways, the reason I’ve decided I might be done. Two nights ago, I went out to a party bar for the first time in a year (pandemic reasons) and someone was buying the whole places shots all night long. I can’t even begin to tell you how many drinks I had that night. I thought I made some friends and we were leaving the bar when some dudes swooped in to try and take everyone back to their place. It felt off to me but since I was so drunk, I started yelling at them, being super aggressive telling them it’s weird and asking “who are you?!?”. For some reason I went back to their place WITH THEM, maybe to protect the other girls (who seemed fine and chill with everything btw) and caused a bigger scene at the apartment. I got scared and ran out of there, only to call my boyfriend and cry-yell into the phone that everyone there is going to get hurt. I realized today that I was totally within earshot of the apartment still and I feel sick about it. I checked my insta and everyone I met and followed at the bar had blocked me. I am so embarrassed and upset at my behaviour. The night ended with my passing out on my shower floor and puking until 4pm yesterday. 

But this happens every time, it just feels like it’s getting worse. I’m destroying my relationships, I can’t make any new friends because I mess it up right away. I hate myself and my actions, and I’m only now learning it might be the alcohol. 

Sorry if this was too long, I just finally feel like I’m not entirely crazy or weak or a monster and I’m just looking for support. (I’m not saying people who struggle with this are any of those things, I just talk to myself like that instead of admitting I have a real issue.)

2021-09-01 11:15:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/pfvywf/questioning_28f/,Questioning? 28F,"Hi everyone,

So I don't know if I'm an alcoholic? I definitely tend to abuse alcohol when I use it. I've started a pattern where i get drunk around once a week. Usually I don't over drink if I'm in a situation that's unsafe/ not advisable like it will affect my work or something, but last night I got very drunk on a weeknight and woke up still drunk - can't go into work until I sober up. I haven't done this since college. My only thoughts are work is very stressful and I burned myself on the stove last night so 'i'll have a glass of wine and watch tv' turned into 'i'm upset - time to get LIT'

I don't crave alcohol per say - but I might say I crave oblivion, as when I drink it's either like one glass or 2 bottles. In college I ABSOLUTELY abused alcohol, used it as kind of a coping/ self harm thing. Kelly Osborne's 'drink in the hope of not waking up' was an apt quote. Also all references to cocaine are from the college days.

Things that concern me:

1. I don't have good control of it, if I'm in a situation where I'm like ""sure, I can get drunk"" i get absolutely slammed.
2. I sometimes (few times a year) pee in my sleep when I've drank.
3. I black out very easily - I've blacked out off 3 beers before.
4. I feel like I somehow crave getting blacked out, like I've turned it into my 'stress releif' solution as the ultimate 'turn off my brain' situation & i don't know what to do to replicate it. I think being hungover is actually similar as it's my way of going on 'standby mode' so the pattern is - blackout friday, be hungover & therefore relaxed saturday, do chores & work sunday-friday.
5. I've learned that drinking when I'm angry, sad, very excited, and upset are all bad ideas because I'll overdo it and cause bother for my friends. I guess I'll add stressed & in pain to the list.
6. I have adhd so I know I'm at risk
7. When I drink I start getting that feeling, like when you drink too much coffee or adderall, kind of like when a coke comedown starts & that's what I think the root of the problem might be?
8. Anxiety is probably part of this, sorry I don't know what else to do exactly, unfortunately I hate weed. I've avoided benzos because I suspect I will like them \*too\* much.
9. I am typically a happy drunk & when I first started drinking in college I remember being like 'oh my god this is the happiest I've ever been/ best I've ever felt!' Later when I tried mdma it reminded me of that feeling. Also probably not great.
10. When I drink I get anxiety about having more alcohol & if I'm in 'drunk mode' I ALWAYS go to bed with more alcohol - even if I've blacked out I always wake up in bed with typically a full glass/can/bottle sat next to my bed. I used to be this way with coke as well, I'd take a line before going to bed almost always.

Any advice? I've been to AA meetings before, but I often find them kind of not applicable as it tends to be people who are more on the 'crave alcohol' end of the spectrum. Like I listen to the stories & I go 'welp that's not me, guess I'm fine!' Similar to books I've read etc. I even dated an alcoholic once (did NOT go well lol - turns out he was a secret heroin addict too, fun!) but in the same way I was like ""well clearly I'm not like him so...""

Also it doesn't help that my mom is a VERY overreacting type - first time I got drunk EVER she took me to an AA meeting, set up a meeting with a girl who I think she was hoping would be my 'sponsor' (quotes because I wasn't in AA) then called me an alcoholic for years & bought me various books on alcoholism and brought up that my grandpa (i'm adopted) died by falling down the stairs drunk at various intervals. My mom truly believes that if you are a person who gets drunk, or enjoys feeling drunk you are an alcoholic. It took my friends, roommates, and therapist (although they were also all 20somethings who liked to get drunk/ sometimes blacked out) telling me I wasn't to undo my schema, and unfortunately her being like this makes me always have a little voice in my head saying 'maybe I'm just overreacting like mom.'

Specifically this is unfortunate because it adds annoying internal conflict to my 'am i an alcoholic or not' mental debate.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992897510528564}"

A feat  I thought was unachievable 2 years ago, got myself together, fixed my relationships, changed jobs a couple of times, had another kid (intentionally) survived a plague (so far)

It's been a hell of a couple of years but I made it through without touching a drop like I promised on day one.
