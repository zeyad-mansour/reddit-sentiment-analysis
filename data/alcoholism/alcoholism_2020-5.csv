I never feel the need to drink while high. I do it sometimes tho, when I’m in the mood. I usually purchase an amount of pot, smoke it in a few days and then go dry for a few days more. 


If I’m lucky tho, I can maintain my weed habit for weeks. But there are times when I don’t have access to weed for days or weeks and then I just switch to drinking. The thing is that I don’t like being sober for long. I just feel anxious and in the mood for nothing. 


I love smoking weed all day long, but I only drink in the night. I NEVER drinking earlier than 3am. I’m a night owl too. I call going to sleep early before 5am. I am just not in the mood of drinking during the day. It’s not gotten worse either, because I’ve been doing this for almost a year. It’s just my tolerance that’s risen. I drink about 3-6 days a week when I’m not having any weed. I tried taking weeks off and it’s not hard but I always end up thinking: what do I have to lose? And go back to drinking.


My rule is that if I’m having trouble seeing or walking, I’m not having a good time anymore. I never get to that level drunk. Not even close actually. I just want a strong buzz. It’s just uncomfortable for me. I always drink alone, watching TV series and playing video games. 


My personality doesn’t chance while drunk. Like at all. I just do my usual. I can’t say it feels great, but it’s better than sober. I hate going to sleep anxious. Anxiety is my biggest issue and I don’t have access to any else anxiolytics. 


All I drink is a traditional drink which contains 45-65% alcohol (I drink 80-230ml per night). It tastes like shit and it makes me gag. It’s homemade, so I don’t pay a penny to get drunk. At least that. I hate the taste of any alcoholic drink anyway. I just wanna get drunk. So from what I said, do I identify as an alcoholic? And do you think I am going in the wrong path? Also, sorry for my bad English. I am not a native speaker.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70284104}"

I've been depressed since long before I even touched alcohol, and I'll keep being depressed even if I never drink again in my life. Even if I stop drinking I'm still gonna feel like absolute shit, I'm just not going to have the relief of being drunk. I was trying to cut back for a while but now I don't even know why I should bother, sure it's bad for my body and all, but it's a lot less bad than being sober and miserable and eventually killing myself. Like at this point I'm fairly certain I'm just going to kill myself at some point, I might as well do what I can to push that day back, you know? 
I know that everyone is going to tell me that I should quit, or at least want to try, but for the life of me I can't think of a good reason why. My meds make me enough of a lightweight that hangovers aren't an issue, I'm still sober most of the time so alcohol doesn't prevent me from getting things done (my depression does though lol), it's not even costing me that much since I brew my own stuff (which tastes like shit but it gets me drunk so idgaf), so I don't know why I should even bother.

Careful in the way of not having any motivation to better myself and stay in line with my current state of life. Sometimes I wish the mindset that I have when I'm buzzed can be my normal mindset. This causes me to drink every day to experience this buzzed feeling. Many times I don't reach it since my tolerance is so high now, so I end up drinking a lot more.

We both arrived on the same date and left 28 days later, sharing a small cabin.  He was there to try and get ahead of a criminal court case, and didn't have substance abuse issues.  We talked each other off the ledge everyday, and planned to get together and go on his boat in 2021, once shit returned to normal.  He was a successful self made businessman with a daughter in high school.  He was going through a nasty divorce but spoke of getting back to his businesses, dogs, and most importantly, his daughter.  He snuck a contraband phone into the facility do he could call and text her during the day, which he did all day everyday.

We had traded texts a couple times after leaving but he didn't respond to a text so I called him and it went to straight to voicemail.  Thought he may have deactivated the phone from rehab.  Looked him up online today to see if I could find his contact info. The first result was his obituary.  He passed two weeks after treatment. 

I'm in shock right now.  He was a cool, smart and funny dude.  Employed 75 people.  Daughter in private school, boats, motorcycles, cars, trucks, houses.  Wish he had reached out, maybe could have talked him off the ledge one more time.  He's the last person I would have expected from all the people at rehab.  We had talked at length about how rehab was the worst of it, and how things were  going to vastly improve once we were back in society.

But in the past I've noticed from time to time when I went to AA meetings.  It seriously felt like the thought of drinking actually increased the more I went to meetings.  

And I've started to notice a similar feeling now that I've started coming into this sub.  The thought of drinking seems to be more frequent than it did before I came here....  
This is pretty frustrating,  I wanted to try and help people struggling in this sub and also build more of a support network by talking with people here.  

But I'm starting to question if not coming here at all might be the best idea for me.  

To give some context about my personal life.  I moved to Texas from Michigan almost 2 years ago and the change of scenery has been very good for me.  Now I haven't been able to remain completely alcohol free and I still have some binge nights.  But it's far less frequent and most importantly the cravings/ obsessing thoughts of drinking have improved even better than I could hope for.

But,  recently with the lockdowns,  my anxiety has really been increasing and the urge to numb myself with alcohol is getting stronger.  

Back to my main point though,  has anyone had similar feelings that for instance they started to think about alcohol the more they went to AA meetings and they realized that wasnt the best option for them?",1,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42022836}"

She is 65 now and also smokes cigarettes- I would estimate a pack a day. she has gone through brief stints of not drinking or smoking, but none have lasted more than like 3 months.

it’s a self medicating thing. her relationship with my dad is poor- a massive part of it is because my dad detests her smoking and drinking. last year she quit her job very suddenly and I think part of it was a general depression she had. since january of 2019, she has been just at the house all day every day. she doesn’t have friends or anyone to spend time with except me or my dad, and they now both have COVID so I haven’t been to see them for a while. i talk to her on the phone every day. she also has some kind of autoimmune disorder that causes a lot of joint pain and that kind of thing, and will not go to the doctor because she says that they don’t listen to her. my dad says she just wants vicodin and they won’t give it to her so she doesn’t bother. she has had severe depression for a long time but won’t go to therapy because she says it has only helped her in times of crisis, but she does take antidepressants. she is very thin, she had an eating disorder as a young adult and I would say most of her daily calories come from beer. 

she never drank at work or before driving. she also never drank when she was pregnant w me or my older brother, to my knowledge. 

she has COVID and had to order beer to be delivered because she could not go one day without it. I think we (my family) have to talk to her about it. she is so depressed and her drinking (and smoking, which I view as hand-in-hand circumstances) is not helping. how do I talk to her about it? I don’t want to be insensitive or force her into anything, but I want her to know how painful it is for us to see her be like this.

I am 30 and I have been an alcoholic for three years now. It hit me all of a sudden after not being a drinker at all for my entire youth. It started after of series of really shitty events in my life that happened all on top of each other. I’m averaging 8-12 drinks a day, every day. I’ve tried to taper and quit several times but have never made it past 4 drinks a day and I always relapse. I haven’t been sober one day in three years. 

I am apparently a pretty functional alcoholic because I still have my jobs, still doing well in school, and it took my family years to realize how much I was drinking. 

I have two major problems that are (in my mind anyway) impeding my ability to get sober. 

1. I am terrified to seek any professional treatment because I’ve been a victim of malpractice by both the medical and psychiatric systems when I was younger. I know this sounds like paranoid nonsense but it’s true and both instances ruined my life for years. 
2. I really don’t want to have to stop drinking forever. I don’t know a single person who doesn’t drink regularly, not one. I want to be able to have drinks with my friends occasionally or wine with a nice dinner. If I were to stay away from alcohol situations forever, I would have to completely isolate myself from everyone I know, including my family. I know it may be naive to think that I might be able to manage to have a social drinking life being an alcoholic. 

I also have a major, daily responsibility to my family. I cannot be away from them or even take time to myself to try and conquer my drinking.

How the hell do you injure your ankle this badly sleeping?

I'm male, in my 40s, my mum's in her late 70s.  She's lived with her partner for nearly 30 years.  He works long (12 hour) shifts in a safety critical job, meaning when he's working he's away for around fifteen hours.  My mum's always hated being alone, so over the years turned to alcohol as a support.  Her partner also drinks fairly heavily at times when they're together and relaxing.

A few years ago her drinking came to a head when she met up with friends and ended up passing out and having to be brought to mine in a taxi.  She had a realisation then, went to the doctors and 'alcoholism' was officially diagnosed. For a while she was back in control, recording her drinking in a diary and so on.  I should also add that this past few years her memory has been affected, and she's been diagnosed with dementia.  Personally I think it's alcohol-related dementia but it hasn't been recorded as such.

However things slipped and she had more heavy drinking spells, once with the neighbours where she ended up almost passing out.  She can be quite nasty when she's drunk and a completely changed person.  Her partner has tried his best to help in his own way; but then my mum would call him a 'control freak'.  Most recently he discussed things with her and took her bank cards away.

This resulted in her saying this was like domestic abuse.  This has been the final straw for her partner and yesterday announced he is leaving her.

I know this sounds selfish, but the whole situation has been massively stressful on myself.  I'm in a different city to my mum, and am a full-time carer for my disabled husband, so there's a limit to what I am able to do.  I'm not sure if my mum is able to live alone, and I just have this huge dread about the future now.

Last night I had 10 beers and two margaritas and probably could have kept going but I just passed out on the couch and then moved to my bed at some point.

I work nights so when my wife goes to sleep (she’ll have a few drinks with me but has a limit) I end up drinking late into the night.  Even drinking with her, I’ll sneak an extra shot when she’s doing something or outside so that I can keep a strong buzz.  I was pretty drunk last night which has been like the majority of my days, especially with this pandemic stuff.  I brought it up to her one time a few weeks ago hoping that she would agree but she thinks that I don’t have a problem and can control it.  I think deep down she’s worried that the fun will end if I stop.

When I woke up today, I felt like trash and she had just left for work.  I knew I wouldn’t see her until tomorrow because of my schedule so I cracked a beer and told myself it was to get me back to normal and then I’d only have the one.

I will think about 1-to-1 therapy when this is all over. Group situations, particularly if there are any connections with religion, would tip me over so that path is absolutely not for this atheist.

The next logical action is to remove the temptation and eradicate alcohol from the house entirely. Most of it has been in our cupboards for more years than I care to count so I dread to think what state it's in or what consuming it would do. As my partner doesn't (and can't) drink and I am endeavouring not to from this point forward, having many questionable bottles of the stuff close to hand serves no purpose other than to be too close for comfort should my will give way. If circumstances conspire to create the perfect storm, it would be all too easy to buckle and, as I have recently proven to myself, it needn't be my preferred tipple before I'll drink it anyway. I wouldn't drink most of that stuff under normal circumstances but there is clearly a trigger that alters my actions and makes me reckless. Once there, I'm a different person. I don't know who that person is, as I have zero recall once I cross that line. Not even fragments. The one person who sees the manifestation at its worst is my partner and her patience has ended. That's the most important reason I need to draw a line under this chapter and move on.

Down the sink (most of) it goes. The smell of it alone nearly made me vomit, red wine gone bad mostly. What a waste. I'll be donating unopened bottles of spirits to friends who have a healthier relationship with the stuff than I do but the rest needs to be out of these four walls and quickly.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67044264}"

I want to say that, it is possible to taper yourself down from drinking a lot. 

I may not be the worst case, but at my worst, I was drinking about 12-15 drinks per day. Average on the higher end.

I put myself on a schedule that let me have 10 (per day), then 9, then 8 (about a week per level), now I'm at less than 6 and going quicker to get myself completely sober in the next two weeks. I restructured how I viewed my relationship to alcohol and realized that it rarely did much good for me. I've become a lot clearer headed and I've felt better than I have in years. I've had no medical intervention, and it took me a few months of low stress (being quarantined) to get to this point, but I've successfully tapered myself to a much healthier level and close to nothing than I ever have been.

I have been struggling with alcohol since I was 17. Everytime I drink/drank it always ended with me blacking out. It really got bad when I turned 21. I had transferred to a new college. When I went into college I hadn't become an alcoholic, but I left that college an alcoholic. I would drink 12 beers nearly every night and by that I mean I didn't always drink 12 but I drank every night, alone in my dorm room. While I was there I had a falling out with friends and I just felt really alone after that. So after I flunked out of college after 1 semester, I came back home and continued to destroy my life. Before my family confronted me. They sent me to a 30 day inpatient rehab. After that month away I learned many tips and tricks, but I wasn't ready to quit just yet. I mean being in your early twenties and not being able to drink ever again just seemed to difficult to do, considering everything I did involved drinking. So once out of rehab, it wasn't long before I started throwing back the drinks. Only this time it was a lot worse. At age 22 and 23 I was in and out of jail for minor things. Which led me to have to use a breathalyzer 3 times daily ordered by the court. Well that didn't go so well, I would find ways to drink a few and I would get away with it for a while before one night I drank too much and it came time to blow into the breathalyzer and I was positive for alcohol. Later on I got a call saying there was a warrant for my arrest for failing to the conditions from the court. After all that mess I went to rehab again thinking that was the best decision at the time. After that I did a little better until one day I slipped. From then on I would have anywhere from 8 beers to 24 every night alone in my room. Until recently at age 24 I started drinking hard liquor. I know I have a problem, I have known for a while, but I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to quit so badly but don't know how to do it. I feel like I can't seem to find a purpose in life. There are a ton of things missing from this story but I wanted to hit on the main points. Can anyone relate to this or am I a worthless pile of garbage?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78193873}"

I'm not an everyday drinker these days, but I have been in the past. Now in my late 40s, I've been a social drinker (Friday nights, Saturday afternoons mostly) for the best part of the last few years. My partner had to stop drinking 3 years ago after developing pancreatitis (for clarity, not alcohol related) and understandably she now doesn't want to waste her weekends being the sober one among the drunks. So the pub visits are fewer and briefer, but I feel like I'm making up for lost time when I do go. I'll rarely consume less than 8 pints in a session, no matter how brief the session. I rarely drink in the house and, since Covid arrived and the UK pubs shut, I haven't consumed more than 3 bottles/cans of beer one day per week and then usually only to mark the end of the working week. My problem has always been knowing when to stop and ending up losing self control.

The latest episode happened 48 hours ago where I crashed & burned badly. It's a grim time in our house with an imminent bereavement (my partner's elderly mother, sadly) expected any time now. The mood is fraught and like clockwork, the one time I'm needed and being counted on to provide emotional support, true to form, it all falls apart. When my partner left for a hospital visit, I had just finished my third beer. There were six bottles/cans in the fridge - they all went. There was a 700ml bottle of alcopop, that went next. By that point, I'm past hitting the stop button. The next target was a large bottle of single malt that has been sat in the cupboard for 5 years, waiting for a suitable occasion. It was 3/4 full. I rarely drink spirits, thus the reason the bottle had been left mostly untouched all this time, but that went too - all of it. My partner returned from the hospital visit to find me face-down & unconscious on our roof terrace with cuts to my cheek, chin, arms and knees. She's absolutely livid with me and justifiably so. She doesn't have the headspace to deal with this additional burden and at this stage, I don't know whether my selfish and reckless actions will have irredeemably damaged my relationship with her. I didn't rush to offer an apology yesterday either; partly due to shame and a loss to explain why I ended up in that state, partly because I was still so utterly drunk I could barely string two words together. Inexcusable, either way. The truth is I don't know why I got into that state, only that I had the means and did so.

I've had blackouts before. I don't think about the consequences at the time. Sure, I know exactly what's likely to happen. I kid myself that I might get away with it and hope that my partner will simply shrug it off, but I'm just as likely to invoke a wall of silence and dismay at my disgraceful behaviour (alcohol-induced narcolepsy, stinking like a brewery) then spend the subsequent days eating humble pie and quietly pretending each slip-up didn't happen. I simply can't trust myself to stop once I've started, my willpower goes out the window. Conversely I have willpower in droves in other aspects of life (example: I quit smoking 20 cigarettes per day nearly 10 years ago by going cold turkey) so this weakness is very much fixated on alcohol.

It is honest to admit I have used alcohol as a crutch throughout my adult life. I'm badly overweight, lack self confidence and alcohol has always been my go-to. In my head, I'm the happy fat guy, the life & soul of the party by the 3rd or 4th drink, but the reality is probably closer to being that I'm a burbling mess of a human being, an annoying idiot and a drunk. I don't have a wide circle of friends, I only have drinking buddies who, being completely frank, will have barely seen me sober in many, many years because socially, we only ever meet at the pub.

Alcohol has affected my relationships with family and loved ones in the past in starkly similar circumstances and I need to face up to the fact that I have an unhealthy and dangerous relationship with alcohol which needs to end for my sake and for my partner's sanity. As she so saliently put it to me, you don't have to drink every day to be an alcoholic. It was her advice to explore the subject on reddit. She has the benefit of 3 years hindsight following her own, drastic lifestyle change and even in this time of abject sadness for her, she still has the grace to share advice for the greater good.

I'm not one to go into therapy (not that there are many options at the moment). I don't think I could look another human being in the eye and say what I'm saying here, so this will have to do for now. One day at a time. This is day 2.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6482131}"

I am a 27M, industrial designer working in LA. I moved here 3 years ago because I was tired of the cold New England weather and irritated by people’s attitudes. 

I have had a drinking problem since college. I think it was just boredom from getting my first job and living alone. I used to think it wasn’t an issue and it couldn’t hurt me. I was in denial for so long it never occurred it would catch up to me.

I am German/ Irish originally from Boston. As some can imagine my family are all drinkers. My parents would almost drink and fight every night growing up. They never could pick me up from sports at night because they were already so wasted. It sucked

I really started to lose control this past summer. My grandfather passed away and we were very close. He didn’t drink because he lost both his parents and two of his brothers to alcoholism. Which is concerning because its part of me.He was a Navy Vet, served in WW2 and Korea. I could talk to him about anything, everything. But when he passed I couldn’t contain the urge. It only got worse. Every time I drank I needed a shot of whiskey to go with a beer. All day/ night same thing. There was a period where I couldn’t remember what I did all weekend. It was bad. 

Here’s where I need help. I started dating this incredible chick in the fall. She’s a doctor of internal medicine. Met her on bumble and didn’t have alot of expectations. But we hit it off really well and had a blast. I cant even give a reason why I started to pull this shit but I started sneaking shots. I think it was because of anxiety and dating someone like her. It started to get bad when I started hanging with her friends. Maybe because I don’t have many here I felt like I needed something extra to boost my personality. I still cant believe I made that decision and I kept getting away with it I didn’t see an issue. She started to catch on and I begged her that it wasn’t a problem. She came over on a Saturday morning and I had a buddy over the night before. We drank a bit and watched some TV. In the morning there was one shot left in the small bottle and I just took it. She came over and immediately knew. She had my stuff in her car already because it was my last chance.

Its been a month since that day. I haven’t drank. I haven’t seen anyone. I bought The Naked Mind and started to really focus on who I want to be. We have talked a bit but nothing more than a couple long texts. I miss her. 

I want to try and get her back but not exactly sure how to go about it. I am so embarrassed and I am sure her friends, family now know.  Any advice would help, I have to do something or I can never truly forgive myself.

Originally, my husband hated drinking and completely saw no benefit in it so we never really had the desire to drink. 

Lately, it seems like my husbands in a downward spiral drinking. He went from enjoying a beer when out to now having one or more every day after work and socially he never has less than 6 beers and often mixes beer with liquor. He always says he won’t get drunk prior to a party or days “I’m not taking shots just beer” but once we’re there he gets out of control and is always really drunk. I seem like the bossy wife telling him when I think he’s had enough and yet he keeps drinking. Little does everyone else know I am the one having to care for him EVERY weekend when he’s vomiting and making a huge mess. Another factor in my hesitance is the next day when he’s hungover he is so mean and there is no convincing him he is wrong. Then he apologizes a few days later when I tell him I can’t handle it. He will be on the verge of tears when I tell him I’m not dealing with this habit forever and I will leave, but then the next weekend he’s back on his same crap. He’s been so drunk that I’ve had to clean him up after laying in his own vomit and he said after that he would never drink again and stopped maybe 2 months max. He always claims that it helps him be more social to drink. I think his behavior at a party is embarrassing and immature. Even worse he’s getting trashed with his boss and coworkers. I worry that this could turn into an addiction and more than just problem drinking. He has bouts of anxiety and depression and I worry this will become his outlet to cope. 

Before we married I found out after 5/6 years together that he had a pornography addiction. I was shell shocked. We BOTH made a personal decision that porn was not welcome in our relationship (no shame to anyone else this was OUR decision that he actually initiated.) I essentially told him that he either had to let me help him overcome this or I was leaving. He claims to have quit and never relapsed as he was terrified of losing me. 

I know to many I seem uptight and naggy but these are things we vowed and agreed to each other as what works best for our marriage and at this point he’s breaking that promise to me. What everyone else does is their business and I’m not judge mental of others, but this is affecting my marriage and is something we agreed upon before we got married.

I hope questions like this are allowed. My partner and I are having a bunch of family over to fix up the house we just bought, for a whole week in june. One of them is my amazing mother in law. She's struggling with alcoholism, last relapse what May 18th this year. She's struggling these days cause the smell of hand sanitizer is triggering it, and we gotta use that constantly. 

It would be customary to buy everyone food, snacks and drinks as we work, so I was thinking only buying non-alcoholic beer and wine and just saying it's our personal preference, but I'm wondering if being in an environment where people would normally drink all day, and seeing beer and wine, would be upsetting, even with no alcohol in the house? Would it be better to just be a bit unorthodox and just serve soda and juice? Or would that just feel embarrasing to her, even if we say it's our preference not to have alcohol? 

I'd ask her but she doesn't want to be a bother and would just tell me to serve alcohol and she'll manage but I want to make it as easy on her as possible. I wouldn't want her to remember her son buying his first house as the time she relapsed again.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4437752}"

Here is what I know and i hoping to get a medical professional of some type to let me know their prognosis. 

My buddy has been drinking heavily and daily for many years. After college he moved to a place where he wasn't happy and I think drinking became his crutch. His dad is an alcoholic who is like 30 years sober, I just added this for context.  We are both 33. He started to day drink not eat food for a while and started to lose a ton of weight. He looked anorexic kind of and I told him 100x he is killing himself. It got to the point where I couldn't be around him because it broke my heart. 

Anyways, I digress. About a month ago he went to the hospital with his stomach super bloated, pancreas fucked up, spreading to liver, and kidneys.  Stays for a week. Gets better,  but on the way home his dumb cunt gf asks if he wants liquor.  He gets some, long story short she comes home from work and this homie is passed out yellow on the couch. Rushed to ER again. Another week in hospital, doctors say if he had another drink he's gonna kill himself.  He goes home, I visit him, seems do be doing better. 

Get a text just now. Apparently, his kidneys have now failed and he had to be put on a ventilator and given dialysis. I want to know what his chances are, what I should do for his family, etc.  Is my best friend about to die?

I dont want to be out side or drive or be around people or go anywhere because I'm afraid of being trapped in a situation of panicking and trying to hide it and acting weird or straight up panicking and embarrassing myself.

(I am sober at the moment I am writing this.) People in college would often come over to my apartment because I drank whether I was alone or not, but preferred not to be. I would always happily supply for everyone even though I was broke. I would bring alcohol to class with me disguised in a water bottle, and if my friends asked for some, I would share. 

It's a few years later now, and two of my friends have made the decision to stop drinking. Part of the resentment for me is that they always seemed to be able to stop. I remember them taking weeks or even months-long breaks from drinking, or them saying to me on any given day that they didn't 'feel like' having a drink. I've never felt physically capable of making that decision, so I resented them for that. 

Since they've stopped drinking, they have made these long posts (mostly on Instagram) detailing their past with drinking, specifying that they used to drink in class (out of my water bottle), etc. I resent that. First of all, because it feels like they blame me or think that I imposed alcohol on them, and also because it almost feels like they're taking something away from me.

I'm not proud of my resentment, and me not being genuinely happy for them making a change in their life makes me feel like a shitty friend. Beyond that, I think I've realized that alcohol was the only thing we really had in common. They have tried to maintain their friendship with me, but I don't really want to.

Everytime they drink they end up barely being able to walk down the damn hallway. Am I just crazy? This isn't normal for parents to do is it? They know how much I hate it. They literally do not care.

I love them and all that and they are cared for and well turned out but booze always takes the front seat. 

What I would like to know if anyone has any experience is this area is roughly how long the physical aspects of withdrawal last?

When I was really young, like 14 to 17, I would drink more than my friends but didn't really feel any severe alcoholic remorse or regret as I do in extremity now. It was maybe from 17 upwards that things started getting really bad. I blacked out a lot, and once this lead to me sleeping with (if you can call it that) and 26yo man at a party, which I have only the faintest memory of. I was in a relationship with an older guy at the time, I think he was 20, and this wasn't a good relationship either, volatile and violent on his part. 

When he found out and broke up with me, things spiraled. I was incredibly depressed and didn't leave the house for a couple of months, and then when I did, it was to heavily drink with friends.  I blacked out and slept with men and led an incredibly chaotic lifestyle. I would sometimes stay out for days on end, it felt normal in the circles I was running in. 

This has led to me making terrible decisions and behaving in ways I never would when sober. I've cheated on boyfriends and worried my mother to no end, and put myself in terribly dangerous situations. I try to give up but am sucked back in by the social aspect of it. 

I'm doing therapy at the moment but I feel like its led me to be increasingly vulnerable when drinking because of the alcohol's depressant effect. I often cut myself and a couple of days bit myself so that there are bitemark bruises on my forearm. I've also been much more loose lipped when drunk, telling people really personal and horrible things that have happened to me, which feel so embarrassing the morning after.

From the outside, I lead a relatively normal and 'successful' life; I have a degree, I'm going to begin studying to be an teacher in September. But I keep fucking up in this area of my life. Does anyone resonate with this? Will I have to come to terms with a life without alcohol?

Background: I am 35F, 70kg, no medical conditions, and can probably be classified as a “high functioning alcoholic”. I started abusing alcohol about 3 years ago (1 bottle per night), and since COVID-19 I started to average at about 2.5 bottles (still can’t believe it, but I counted the number of bottles in recycle twice yesterday!) . 
I made a firm decision to quit as soon as possible, but not sure what is the safest way to go about it. I work from home and take care of my 4yo son full-time these days (I do not drink while alone with my child, only when my husband is home), my husband is away during the day (essential worker). Hence my question - is it safe going cold turkey (given the amount), or do I need to slowly reduce (and if so, what would be an appropriate amount/time)? When I skip drinking for 1-2 days I don’t have any serious withdrawal symptoms, but I read that some health complications may happen on days 3-5. Am I at risk or overthinking this and can go cold turkey? I can handle moderate withdrawal symptoms of course, but, being home alone with a child, I don’t want to risk anything serious.

First, I want to say thank you for the advice you all gave me before when I decided to quit drinking! Thanks to you, over the couple of months I have been able to wean myself off of roughly 800ml of 20% soju a night to about 20ml! I am planning on going completely drink free by next week :)

But my question for you is if there is a brain fog that hangs around for a while when you stop drinking/stop drinking as much? Ive been at this 20ml stage for about three weeks now and I can't quite shake the haze in my brain. This fog has followed me around consistently since I started cutting back (although it definitely isn't as heavy as when I was drinking a lot). The only time the haze has actually went away was the day after I had a dinner with coworkers where I had two shots of a 30% alcohol and then a light beer with food. 

To be honest, it is a bit worrying! I won't go back to drinking heavily again, but I want to know if the fog gets better after time. Thank you all in advance :)",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4366103}"

My psychiatrist and doctor told me today to go to a 3- 5 day detox then a 90 day rehab stay.  Doesn't matter how much or what I drank, they both said same thing without even knowing one an another and I am scared shitless of both.  We all have our crosses to bear.  

I'm scared of detox.

I'm scared of rehab.

I'm scared of breaking up with my bff, alcohol.

I'm scared of my emotions and what I'll find buried there (parents death, my divorce, etc).

I'm on 10mg Diazepam 2 tabs 3 times a day now.  When that runs out, its 5mg 3 times a day.

I'm scared of no pills.

I'm still allowed 8 tall boys a day.  But in a few days my pills will run out.  And as harm reduction was asked of me, I'll be down to one tallboy in a week.  Then none.  And if the detox bed is not available, what then?

I am scared crazy off all of this.  I know it will help me make me a better dad, a better employee, a better person.

I'm scared of a brand new world.  I'm 48 and 6'5"".  I work at a hospital and I've seen yellow jaundiced alcoholic patients wheeled into ICU, never to go home.  I been through things and I've seen things that should scare anyone half to death.  And THIS is the most scariest,  boldest, most out of my comfort zone thing I've ever done.

I just wanted to share and i am sure there are lots like me.  I wont give in.  I will brave this.

But man I am scared.

Here's to new beginnings I suppose.  That took a lot of guts to expose myself like that.  I am semi-impressed with myself.

Backstory:
My mum (49F) has been drinking practically ever since I (16F) was born. I’m not sure how it started but it just got worse and worse and some of my early memories of her were tainted because of her drinking. 

When I was about 8 or 9 she got an injection that would make it so her heart would mess up and she’d pretty much die if she ever drank alcohol. I’m not sure of the science behind it or what the injection is called but it worked for a long long time, up until pretty recently, about two years ago when she started drinking again. Now that time I knew the cause: her business that she shared with “John” and “Jenny” (fake names) was run into the ground due to John’s debt. My mum didn’t know what to do so I guess she just started drinking again. 

It was slow at first and my dad warned me about it saying how I should keep an eye on her because he had a suspicion that she was drinking again but I didn’t really listen because it’d been so long and I didn’t think she’d go back to it. But lo and behold my dad found a nice big bottle of wine in her handbag one night and, honestly, I was devastated. I didn’t know what to do I just wanted her to stop. 

From that point she’s been drinking on and off where sometimes she’d go two weeks without drinking and then other times I wouldn’t even want to come home because I knew she’d be drunk and I didn’t want to deal with it. She often lies about it like if you point blank ask her if she’s drunk she’ll be like no even if it’s undeniable that she is. She’s also tried to blame it on me when my dad found a bottle of wine in the cupboard she was like oh that’s OP’s. It’s almost impossible to have a conversation with her about it because it just seems like she doesn’t listen she just says “okay okay okay yea I’m trying to get better” and stuff like that.

Present day:
So now that we’re in quarantine she’s stopped drinking and there is always one other person with her when we go shopping. But today she came back from the bank with my dad and it wasn’t obvious at first but she was definitely showing signs that she was drunk. She has certain mannerisms that she does when she’s drunk like looking at you with big bulging eyes and smiling in a weird way or pronouncing words with every syllable separate (like okay would become O-KAY). So I noticed that and i just blurted out “are you drunk?” and of course she was like “no, are you crazy?” And that got me because she never says “are you crazy?” unless she’s drunk. So I just kind of left it but I gave her a hug that she was very reluctant to receive and I came upstairs and just cried. 

I don’t know what to do anymore it feels like my dad and I have tried everything to get her sober and it just doesn’t seem to be working. She’s not abusive when she’s drunk or anything so I guess it could be worse but I just want her to be sober.
Over the years we’ve tried: AA meetings, the injection (which we’ve tried multiple times since the first one but I think she’s built up an immunity to it), prescription pills (not sure which ones), taking her credit card away, sending her to live with my grandparents, spending more time with her in general, talking to her about it calmly, talking about all the health risks that come with alcoholism, my dads yelled at her, I’ve yelled at her, we’ve all cried together and it just goes nowhere. 

It’s really causing me stress to have to basically act like a mother to her when she’s drunk and to just see her like that. 

So I’m here for advice. Just anything that could help me get her sober basically or any tips that people have, anything like that would be greatly appreciated. And thank you to anyone who has read through this long ass story.",3,"{'quarantine': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71695125}"

I don't envy you those problems, and I don't want to grapple with them, which is why I'm making this post. 

I have noticed a behavior that's developed in the past year that I consider to be mildly to somewhat concerning, and I felt that this was a safe and correct place to ask.

When I get home from work, especially if the day or week has been a ringer, my mind is in a stupor. In this stupor, I desperately want to drink. Like I think about it almost non-stop until I get a drink. It can go away the closer to bed time it becomes, if I substitute with a less satisfying drink like near beer or la croix, and meditating helps me manage the desire. I usually meditate every day, but some days after work I'm just too exhausted for the mental effort.

When I fulfill the urge, it's almost always one beer. Maybe two. I live in Germany, so they are 500mL beers, not the traditional 12 oz American style. Of course they're delicious which doesn't help.

My concern is that almost the uncontrollable urge to have just one will never go away. I don't want to get blind drunk, but I crave the alcohol to take the edge off, almost to the point of need/obsession. I rarely get drunk, maybe once a month with my German neighbors that drink a lot, and I hate hangovers. I've taken to the tactic of only having non alcoholic beers in the house, but it doesn't always help - I've asked my neighbors for beer several times now when I was really desperate.

He had 6 drinks tonight playing video games with his friends. He seemed to be in a fine mood after, very chatty, but right when I expressed my disapproval of having that many drinks in one night (I worry about his overall health and he just did this five days ago and had a massive hangover), he quickly became angry and upset.

He started to get super defensive. His mood changed so quick. This has happened before on heavy drinking nights. Sometimes it doesn’t happen at all. But when it does, it usually turns into a screaming match. I can tell he was starting to spiral. He kept yelling at me, almost goading me to continue the conversation. He kept asking me why I ruined his mood, and that he was in such a good mood tonight — basically blaming me for making him feel bad even though I apologized. I just pretended I was going to sleep, and I didn’t respond in order to avoid spiraling into a bigger argument. Then he started getting more and more upset, kept telling me to talk to him, and to stop ignoring him. Then finally, he stopped and said ‘fine, but I’m going to be upset in the morning. I hope you have something to say and if it’s bullshit I’m breaking up with you’. Then he fell asleep within 5 minutes. 

He’s usually great, but whenever this happens it’s very disappointing and upsetting. He used to be way worse and has been working hard to be better, and he knows that. He has depression. Whenever this happens, he’s a different, much more rational person. And I always have to tell him what I experienced the night prior. 

Does this happen to anyone? I feel confused right now. Am I wrong to bring up my opinion on him drinking 6 beers? Was I wrong to shut him down tonight?

**My history of alcohol use**

I grew up in a middle class household with mom, dad, and brother. We never wanted for anything financially, my brother and I had many opportunities provided for us. My parents drank beer/wine for as long as I can remember. I have an image of my dad blasted drunk listening to piano music on our home desktop computer.  I was an obedient little boy and made good grades in school, I love school.

The first time I got drunk was @ 16 years old on a snowboarding trip and I thought it was the tits! Loved the drunk feeling from the first moment and continued to drink socially from then on. Experimenting with alcohol with friends, and sometimes  alone cause why not. Also loved weed & cigarettes but thats another story. Looking back I always drank to excess compared to my peers. I was typically the one to black out at parties, have ""funny"" (embarrassing) pictures taken of me, and occasionally piss on someones couch. I was a fun-loving drunk, never violent or driving. This continued through college, occasional during the week drinking, heavy binge drinking on the weekends because it was socially acceptable and widespread. It all seemed ""normal"" when everyone else was doing it. My parents expressed some concern but no frequent or serious enough to gain my attention, I was never seriously injured or had major consequences.

2 years after college I met my now girlfriend, soon to be fiance. We drank lots of wine and beer together, again in ""socially acceptable"" circumstances and amounts. But I always craved excess and have been hungover to the point of debilitation for large family events, vacations, birthdays, 1 christmas, and many many  weekends since we met 5 years ago. At one notable wedding in the middle of a remote forest, I got blasted as usual and decided to ""lay under the stars"" for a while by myself in the woods. For a while no one could find me and I must have woken up because I magically returned to the party (per my girlfriends story the next day.) I cringe at the thought of dying in these situations and get very scared of my past behavior. Another notable event. On Christmas Eve 2018 I was home with my brother, getting blasted together as usual. We made the genius decision to go to the strip club, which was closed, so we ubered to the one across town. We were 2 out of 3 patrons there, with one stripper. We drank more and got a dance, returned home, and continued to drink. The next day I had to lay down in my grandmothers spare bedroom while my immediate and extended family enjoyed a 30 year long tradition of christmas morning together. I napped til 2pm, then threw up from 2pm - 10pm, then to bed.

In summary, I thought I was drinking within the realm of normalcy, alongside all of those who drank around me that I respected; brother, mom, dad, extended family, friends, girlfriend, girlfriends family. Literally all of these people drink to some extent and it started turning into every occasion as a reason or opportunity to drink.

**When I realized it wasn't serving me; How I quit**

I have journal entries from  at-least 5 years ago where I ask myself ""Is drinking all there is to life? Do we ever do anything else interesting?"" Well it took me another 5 years to finally get fed up enough to take action. After yet another Saturday morning of feeling like shit, feeling anxious, feeling pissed off at myself and my girlfriend for drinking again I decided it was time. **Not everything is this simple, I had been going therapy for about 7 months at this point, which was integral to this process, I would highly recommend.** 1 week before her birthday and I couldn't stand the thought of another birthday, I knew I would drink and feel horrible the next day. I told her my concerns and said I was going to stop. She supported me 100% and we got through the birthday without incident. I went to a bar with her & family and drank liquids at the same fast rate as before, this time bubbly water & coffee.

Day 1 and I felt great that I made a change, but alcohol remained a huge part of my life and the life of those around me (Brew pubs anyone? Beers at every family/friend gathering anyone? Beers in the fridge calling your name anyone?). I started to read voraciously on the subject of alcoholism, I needed to understand what I had been through and could expect from the future. I highly recommend this too, because knowledge is power in this situation. You can get just about anything sent to your public library. The book that was my saving grace was **This Naked Mind by Annie Grace**. In this book she explores the basic science of alcoholism, how it affects a person, and works to shift deep seeded though patterns about alcohol that kept me coming back to it. Most notably I though alcohol made me 1) less anxious and 2) more social. Looking back it increased my anxiety a shitload when I wasn't drinking, and when I was drunk I just got quiet and focused on getting drunk, so really no that social. I struggle with insecurity and alcohol was a great equalizer, a shitty one at that. After reading this book my perception about alcohol shifted 180 degrees. I no longer craved alcohol, or thought it would be fun to use. I wholeheartedly saw it as something that added nothing to my life, and frequently made it worse.

One thing that helped me stick with not drinking was being open about it with others, especially those who I did most of my drinking with (family, girlfriend). It held me accountable and responses were overwhelmingly positive. In reality, me quitting drinking has planted that seed in others minds. I continued to see my therapist. I have been eating way more sweets than usual by the way.

Summary: Got fed-the-fuck-up with alcohol robbing me of life all the time, went to therapy, read a book, quit and told everyone about it, ate a lot of sweets.

**Lessons from the Last Year**

* I Can do it and so can you!
* My perception is that the hardest part of quitting is if you have to battle your unconscious mind about it. If your unconscious mind is telling you ""Its fun, you dont have a problem, alcohol helps you socialize, alcohol feels good,"" then you're going to have a hell of a time battling this disease.
* Most people are overwhelmingly supportive of your decision to quit alcohol, don't be shy about telling your support people. If they aren't supportive then they might be struggling with their own alcohol issues, or are just unhappy or something I don't know! Not your problem.
* Underlying emotional / psychological problems are widespread and common in our society. Insecurity, debilitating anxiety, depression, etc... You are not alone. Asking for help is the first step to change. Furthermore, alcohol makes these problems worse, even if it numbs you for a few hours.
* Probably saved a shitload of money!!! Have not calculated it but undoubtedly saved money (and time).

**The future?**

* I've toyed with the idea that I am okay now, and can return to drinking. This happens especially when I'm stressed out. During this time I remember that drinking to reduce stress was an absolutely horrible idea for me, with a proven track record of negative outcomes.
* I plan on being sober for good, but as they say, Its always one day at a time.

Then during the month of April I drank a few beers here and there and felt fine, even getting somewhat tipsy once. Then I went on a drinking binge, and I've stopped again. I feel more like a problem drinker than a dependent at THIS point, however I know I'm at risk to become dependent if I'm not already.

_______________________________________

So, basically I am a 22 year old male who drank for nearly a year straight. I abused alcohol during that time to deal with emotional trauma, then I developed severe anxiety because of it. I would visit and party with my ex, who was away at college, almost every weekend, then come back home and drink almost everyday, but there were periods where I would go a few days, or sometimes a week or so without a drink.

Recently I was two months sober, then had two beers when I was with another girl and that was that, everything was fine and I had occasional drinks with her every now and then for about a month, the month of April to be exact. 

Then one night I was just playing games online with my friends and they were drinking and so I decided eh, what the hell I've been feeling decent, I'll drink. Then I drank for four days, mostly just at night, and had a hard time getting over the anxious feelings, went through a two week phase where I drank everyday and had TERRIBLE anxiety. I'm back to not drinking, but I did withdrawals that caused really bad anxiety, but there are a lot of different things at play for me.

I'm young and can drink in public now, so I'd like to be able to be a social drinker for a lot of reasons, but mostly just because I can enjoy a good time with friends. I'm also a hypochondriac and diagnosed with Anxiety, so when I went on that four day bender of drinking, I think my thoughts had gotten the better of me, and I was just having a withdrawal period that I couldn't handle mentally. 

That being said, I know for a FACT I am a problem drinker, there's no doubt about that in my head, but there was also multiple weeks of me having a few drinks and then putting it down and I was completely okay, so I don't think I'm dependent at all.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44508207}"

What can we do to get her help?,"My mother is 55 and has been struggling with alcohol abuse for about a decade now. She has struggled with anxiety for most of her life and her mother was also an alcoholic too. She will never admit she has a problem and will never seek help. 

She is a housewife and although she is highly educated, she never pursued a career. She is very intelligent and well read and even once had aspirations to go back to university once she no longer had to be a stay-at-home mom. However, now that most of the kids are fully grown up, she just stays at home all the time doing nothing. She doesn't really have friends she sees often, doesn't volunteer, doesn't have hobbies, doesn't even really go shopping. She used to be an incredibly productive and socially active women, but she is a shadow of that these days. 

She drinks in secret by hiding her bottles of booze in clever little spots around the house. My dad, siblings and I have all caught her individually at some point sneaking a drink with her promptly denying it. When we confront her about her issue she either 1. explodes into anger 2. deflects the accusation entirely and changes the conversation. We have told her to get help but she won't as she sees she doesn't have any issue...or won't admit she does. 

She has already been to the hospital once for pancreatitis caused by alcoholism. She was fully in denial about the whole thing and will never talk about it. She also just looks like she is in poor health and will get upset whenever I address any of her obvious health issues. My mother was the pinnacle of health a decade ago and was absolutely gorgeous...she barely looks the same these days. 

We have had countless arguments and tears over my mother's drinking and what it's doing to our family. Most of us are moved out of the house now, but I still have a sibling in high school who still lives with my parents. I honestly worry about my mom picking him up from school after having a drink and I'm very convinced it's happened before. 

My dad is heartbroken over their complete lack of real relationship. He loves her so much and he wants to help her, but she is so not receptive to him in anyway. It's very hard to watch knowing my parents were always the strongest couple anybody knew once upon a time. 

And then there's her relationship with her kids. It's very hard to talk to our mom especially when I call and can tell she's been drinking.

I started drinking when i was 16 and right off the bat was a binge drinker. Whenever my friends and I would drink I would always need to drink more or until i had fallen asleep, I ran into a few legal issues as a teen due to my drinking and plead that i was an addict and got out of legal ramifications by just going to rehab (got away with this 3 times) after i turned 18 and started university, a lot of it seemed under control. I would drink at parties on weekends and such but still ran into problems because of it, mostly due to my need to steal/have sex anything in sight when I was absolutely on the course of browning out, I would start fights with my girlfriends and my friends to the point where I had definitely ruined a lot of my relationships with others. Fast forward to graduating and I decided to move halfway across the country and start over, didn't work. I was secretly drinking and hiding it from my partner while she was asleep soon enough, roughly 5 months after moving I was involved in a random mass shooting and got shot twice, I decided to move back home and try to be with family. By this point a I had lost a lot of my friends due to the fact that i was kind of known as a drunk and started to struggle with severe PTSD from the shooting. Que the daily drinking starting, I was starting to drink on a nightly basis where i would consume roughly 8 drinks in the span of 2 hours every single night. I knew it had to stop because I had told myself i was drinking to deal with my anxiety but ended up making the anxiety way worse, I would wake up shaking and with severe heart palpitations.

2020-05-19 22:31:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gn2yma/first_post_im_ready_to_quit_but_im_already/,First post... I’m ready to quit but I’m already doubting myself due to my surroundings.,"Hi everyone. I need to vent, and I need advice from anyone who may have any. I’ve been in denial about being an alcoholic for a while and I’ve had people tell me they know “so and so” who drinks more than me “and they’re fine” so “I’m fine”... but I’m finally ready to admit and come to terms with the fact that I have an issue and I am not fine. 

Back story: I’m 22 almost 23 and have been drinking since I was 17. I drink because of anxiety, if I’m being completely honest. I have always been the timid shy and a bit socially awkward girl, and one night after drinking, I felt like I was having so much fun and people liked me so much more. People were actually talking to me and I didn’t feel so nervous to be around others at the time like I had always been. This has been the root of my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. At first I would have my older friends or co workers buy me bottles claiming I’m going to “parties” but really I would keep them at home and store them in water bottles to drink whenever I had to do something that made me nervous. Whenever I was going out with friends, whenever I was going to family parties, before job interviews, before serious discussions, before presentations, before dates, you name it. And that’s the problem... I began drinking for EVERYTHING. Because everything gave me anxiety and I just needed to cope and have fun. I never realized until recently that my increasing anxiety has been caused by my “remedy” for it. 

Advice needed: My household is full of drinkers and my grandpa is one of them. He’s been drinking his entire life, and he always has a giant jug of whiskey on top of the fridge. At one point while in college, I couldn’t afford all of my liquor I was sneaking so I started sneaking shots of his whiskey when I needed them. My grandpa gets drunk every night so he can’t tell the difference, and no one else in my house really believes it could be me. The biggest issue here is that I sleep in the living room (it’s a full house) and that when everyone goes to sleep I have full reign over the kitchen and alcohol. It’s become like a “need” for me to take a shot when no one is around. If no one is awake in the morning before I wake up, or if everyone leaves the house... my brain always says “now is your chance to take a shot before anyone notices”. It’s like an instant for me to try and drink when no one is around. I really really really want to stop but the alcohol is always in my face and I get weak at times. Even sitting here typing this knowing no one is around and there is alcohol right near me is hard 

Another issue is that my boyfriends family has a lot of family who is around our age, and they LOVE to party and drink. Whenever I go over there and I try not to drink they shame me and try to tell me “oh so you think you’re better than us now?” I really don’t think I’m better than them, I love them but i feel like if I go around them I will give in. I’m also the one who buys most of the bottles and they refer to me as the person who’s a “professional drinker” lmao, I just know I’m going to cause a problem when I choose to stop. And I also get social anxiety before hanging out with them so I pre drink even before going in. I recognize sound like I’m making excuses... these are terrible excuses. It’s the stupid anxiety 

I want to stop, I just don’t know where to begin or even if I could becsuse it’s almost like I’m always surrounded by alcohol. I’ve been working out and have gotten better about not drinking in the morning but when night comes and everyone sleeps, it’s over. I want to lose more weight, I want to be happier, I want to be smarter, and I want to stop drinking. It feels almost impossible",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5151415}"

I'm not sure if this is the most appropriate place to reach out for help, but I am so, so desperate. If you have any resources or advice to give or even direction to take, I would be immensely grateful for just anything. Even just a virtual hug at this point.

Before I continue, I just want to say that there are some mentions of physical abuse in this post.

My dad (65M) has been a person affected by alcoholism for roughly six years now. My mom (who lives with him) and I (who is a college student living away from home) both believe that this dependency began due to his diagnosis of chronic cancer. On top of that, my dad has a myriad of health issues. He has had several back surgeries, and he just had a heart attack this past summer.

I do not get along with my dad whatsoever. We've never gotten along, even before his alcoholism. But two years ago, any remnants of our relationship were completely destroyed. On this day, the both of us went to tour my university. During the visit, he left me to go to the bars on campus. We met up about an hour later and proceeded to head home. Now, I'm not very fond of driving and my dad didn't seem impaired, so we decided that he would drive us home. Half-way back, he suddenly breaks out into a fury of rage, seemingly fueled by alcohol. He nearly drives us off the road while trying to PURPOSEFULLY hit another car, and I begin freaking the fuck out. My memory is blurred, but I do know that he choked me. I was in shock and immediately contacted my mom as I couldn't stop crying about either of the incidents. I felt so unsafe around him, and this is when everything started getting terrible.

About a month later after this event, my mom suggests that I talk to my dad - explain to him how he hurt me and why I refuse to talk to him. Because for some reason, he failed to understand what he did wrong. So I took her advice and spoke to him, explaining that I didn't want him in my life if he was just going to cause me pain. To my surprise, he said he didn't even remember choking me and failed to believe that he would ever do that to me. He understood my hesitancy and feelings towards him, and to try and repair the damage, he said that he would try to become sober... that he would never touch a drop of alcohol again.

Well, he was sober for less than two days...

Throughout the next few years, my family proceeds to get into (almost nightly) arguments. I continue to rarely speak to my father. I stop coming home from school. I try to distance myself from him as much as possible. all of this has broken my heart though, as I am incredibly close to my mother and I feel so much guilt knowing that I leave her with him. She tells me constantly that she has dealt with worse, but I'm starting to think that he can't get much worse. He drinks every day without fail. He does something reckless every day without fail. He yells and screams and just acts like this man-child every day without fail. He's just this awful individual who my mom refuses to believe is her husband and who will eventually change. I've begged her to leave him, for her to ask him to leave if he doesn't get help - but she doesn't. And I'm so tired of pleading with her to stand up for herself and I.

Since March, I've been living at home with my parents. My mom is immunocompromised and can die from just the flu virus, so I've been going out for her to spare any unnecessary exposure. My father, on the other-hand, has been in and out of the emergency room three times since April alone and constantly going on booze runs.

The first time was when he was working on our lawn mower, and he cut off the tip of his pinky finger. He was so drunk that he failed to realize he was missing the nail & tip, so he didn't go to the ER until the next day when he had sobered up. My mom and I weren't even aware as he had told us that he simply cut his finger and placed a band-aid on it.

The second time was wen he had an afib attack. For those of you who don't know, it's basically having an irregular heartbeat which can lead to strokes or, in his case, another heart. Again, he was in and out of the ER, potentially exposing himself, my mother, and I all to COVID-19.

The most recent time (last week) was when my father fell down a small flight of stairs, resulting in the loss of 2 pints of blood. Yes, he was incredibly intoxicated when this happened. Currently, his ENTIRE left side of his body, beginning at his shoulder and ending at his knee, is as purple as Grimace from the McDonaldLand commercials. I've shown my friends, and they've commented on how he looks like he was hit by a car as it is soooo bad. The doctors said that some of the blood loss actually had to do with his alcohol consumption since his blood is so thin (on top of being on blood thinners for other reasons...)

The reason why I'm posting now though is because of today.

Today, we got into a disagreement as a family because he insisted on taking the car. He was drunk by 11am and could barely walk, so I tell him calmly that he cannot leave. If he needs something, he can let me go and get it for him. He tells me to fuck off and says that he will leave if he wants. I grab onto his shirt, pulling him back and start asking for the car keys. He then shoves me, and my mom gets involved, demanding that he gives her the keys. He scoffs, looks at me, and whips the car keys at me, hurting me in the process. The reason he wanted to leave? To get more alcohol.

I'm at a total lost. I don't know what to fucking do. I don't feel safe in my own home, and I'm so scared that he's going to get COVID-19 and expose my mom to it. I'm so scared of losing her and having her die because of his recklessness. I've asked my mom to kick him out since we've offered to get him help so many times and he has refused it, but she just can't bring herself to do it. Please, please, please tell me that there's something I can do to get him help or get my mom help. I'm so tired of living in fear and anger.

We’ve been friends for decades, and as we’ve gotten older, her weekend binge drinking has turned into a nightly ritual with her being drunk by 9pm several days per week. She works full time and has a high-stress career, and would be regarded as a “functional” alcoholic, who has been doing this for many years.  She’s already been through diversion after a recent DUI.

My own situation has resulted in a move to another state, and it’s been very sad and difficult being away from her. We stay in touch a couple times a month, but she only calls me when she’s buzzed or more, and it’s getting harder for me to pick up the phone.  I feel terribly guilty that I moved away, and I genuinely fear for her safety and the safety of her child. She’s in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship that is exacerbated by her alcoholism, and her child has existing behavioral issues that are aggravated by the situation in general.  She has family in a nearby state, but that relationship has been strained most of her adult life. Instead of offering support, they make her feel even worse about herself and judge everything she does, right or wrong.

Her boyfriend lives with her and I can hardly even speak to her when he’s around.  I’ve tried to convince her to leave him, talked to her a million times about how worried I am about her drinking, suggested that she gets counseling, offered to go to AA meetings with her, and stood by her while most of her other friends have bailed.  I’m afraid she’ll push me away if I give her an ultimatum, but I also don’t want a front row seat as she self-destructs. 

What else can I do to help her?  Any advice or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.  I don’t want to abandon her, but can’t help but feel myself distancing from her as the months go on.  It’s breaking my heart.

I'm 41 now and drank and took recreational drugs to the Nth degree until 4 years ago. After a 20 year slow motion human car crash, I ended up spending 6 months in bed drinking whiskey and weighing in at 225lbs which for a 5ft6 guy is fucking massive. Every night I passed out I half expected/hoped not to wake up. 

It was fear that motivated me to get up. Fear of dying without flourishing. Fear of giving in. Fear for my family. 

I ended up in rehab and 6 months later had dropped 65lbs and had swapped one addiction for another (fitness). Within a year I was a personal trainer and spent 2.5 years helping others be the best version of themselves. 

However, in all that time I never truely believed in myself despite everything I achieved. I would be showered with praise and looked up to for my physical and seemingly mental transformation. The words of others meant nothing to me. 

In time, I felt that I was at a crossroads. Push on and progressively improve or stagnate and ultimately regress. My lack of self belief lead me to the latter. For over a year I wrestled with the question if I could drink again. I really went down the rabbit hole with it including weekly counselling sessions so it was very much a conscious decision to drink again last November. After all, if I can be such a badass and sort my shit out then I can handle it better than most, right?

Wrong. It's Monday afternoon. I am 2 weeks into a rebound after a 10 day monk-like regime. Every time I have one drink, it sets me off for days or weeks. Yesterday I drank 5 bottles of wine. I've bought 3 today but I doubt it will be enough. I'm fat again and embarrassed that people I know will see me in the street. This makes me drink more.

They say recovery is about connection. I never learned this and have white-knuckled it alone and ultimately failed. I've tried AA in the past but tbh I felt that i wasn't like the other people there. 

I don't know how it's going to turn out this time. I need to find my love of fitness again but as soon as I feel better about myself I end up drinking again. I guess I never even made it to step 1. 

Thanks to those of you who have read this far. 

I wish you all the best with your own personal battles.

It’s gotten to the point where unless I have at least 3 beers in me (but that number usually climbs) I feel like utter ass. Shakes, chills, hot flashes, and mostly debilitating anxiety.
I’m currently laying in bed with a headache and dry lips trying to chug water. Feels kinda like a fever but if a fever was anxiety. I’m so tired of this shit.

Go to bed and wake up feeling kinda gross but I could just shake it off and eat a good meal. Now, like today/yesterday for example I drank and entire bottle and a 6 pack. Went to bed and woke up 4 hours later dead sober and feeling like dicks.

Two weeks ago he was rushed to hospital with all the (we know now) classic signs of liver failure. Swelling, jaundice, itching etc. Last year he suffered a stroke and has spent a year in physio learning to walk again, no one ever mentioned his liver but he was diagnosed diabetic. He hasn't drank alcohol at all since the stroke. Prior to that he would have 2/3 cans of lager most days, maybe wine with my mum at the weekends. Never chaotic, I can only recall seeing him 'drunk' 3/4 times in 20 years. What he did before then I can't testify, travelled, partied, tells the best stories. 

He/we have been so invested in his recovery from the stroke... He learned to walk again and was on the brink of driving... That we completely missed this. 

He spent a week in hospital, underwent a procedure called banding, had 7 litres of fluid drained and was then discharged with meds and diet advice. We started plotting out a new normal and adjusting, the docs were reluctant to give us numbers and said to focus on following the new advice but did  eventually give us a B9 score on the child pugh scale so we knew things weren't great. The focus seemed to be getting him well enough for a biopsy? 

In the two weeks since discharge he's lost 15 kilos, no further swelling (he was 83kilos on leaving hospital, and was 68 on readmission yesterday) and his mental health has taken a good bashing, getting him to eat was a struggle. Yesterday he began vomiting the tar like blood you hear about. He's now sedated in ICU.

Then we had a night where he drank a lot, and got verbally abusive and was threatening me physically because a male friend of mine texted me. After this, we agreed to a 6 beer limit, which has been a fight now for almost a year. There are many times he has more and tells me that he decided it was okay or that he isn't following the rules anymore. I don't want to have these rules, but I am afraid to make him mad when he gets drunk and I felt like a limit was a good way to avoid the fights. 

There have been many of times since the initial agreement that he drank more than we agreed, I get upset, and he gets verbally abusive and tells me absolutely awful things. A week ago I told him I was struggling to keep up with everything and he swore he was ready to change, and it happened again last night. He drank a LOT, got angry with me for asking him to stop, and then drove drunk to who knows where. 

In my head, drinking problems have to do with the amount consumed, but now I am not so sure. He has cut down significantly since we have been together and told me he thinks he used to have a drinking problem (drinking 30+ beers every weekend night). I guess I am wondering if this is still considered to be a drinking problem even though he isn't frequenting like he used to.

Not sure why I'm posting this, but figured that others might be struggling aswell.

About 6 weeks ago I relapsed after being sober for about 9 months. I was having a rough couple of months at work due to not getting a promotion I was promised and other things, and on top of that I was in quarantine due to the state of the world so I was over thinking everything way to much. So one day I relapsed and I drank daily for about a month. Not to crazy, didn't get blackout drunk but still fairly drunk towards the evenings.

One day when I woke up I got that familiar feeling that made me quit before. I felt terrible and had the word anxiety ever so I decided that enough is enough. I've managed to get away from feeling like this one's and I can do it again so I just decided then and there to get back to my regular happy self that I am when sober.
All of you know that this is easier said than done, but with the support of my wife I managed and am now ones again sober for 16 days and counting.


I guess I'm posting this in case others have had the same situation, just know that you've done it before and can get back to sobriety again. I know it's hard but it can be done.
And if someone is struggling to get sober know that there is help and that there is no shame in asking for it.

I used to have a couple beers after I got home from work, but nothing that got me totally wasted, just to relax. We got shut down mid-March, and my drinking got completely out of control shortly after. After realizing I went through eight handles and three 30-racks in a matter of a month, I made the decision to give up liquor entirely because I knew I couldn’t control myself if I had it around. Decided to give up wine about a week after that for the same reason (I would buy boxed wine and go through it in two days). It’s been about 2 weeks since I’ve had liquor and a week since I’ve had wine. I’m doing well thus far, but I still drink beer almost every day.

I never used to drink but did medicate for sleep and anxiety with small amounts of cannabis. I started drinking approx 9 years ago after my discharge from a mental health ward because the nightmares I was experiencing were horrific. It was small amounts at first, maybe 4cans of lager and then bed. But has increased over the years to over 10 cans an evening.

I self referred myself to a local authority addiction treatment service in January and things were going well at first, I was attending groups, managed to reduce my intake to 7. But with lockdown measures and the surreal times we are living in, the group's were cancelled, only telephone contact from my key worker is allowed at present. 

My in take keeps going up and down, the lower it gets, the more the anxiety and sweats kick in, as well as the nightmares coming back. I'm see sawing basically, up and down but am not making positive progress.

I'm 40, single, no dependants, I live alone. My parents won't even acknowledge I have a problem as they drink themselves. I'm not an abusive drunk, I only drink of an evening before I sleep.

That was 2 months ago and since then my drinking has gotten significantly better than it was before. I went from a bottle of 750ml vodka every other day to maybe 3 bottles of wine a week then eventually to only drinking (Ill be it still heavy) on the weekends for about the past 3 weeks. 

My doctor is proud of my change as weve consistently discussed my alcohol issue for about a year now and this is the best ive been since I started heavy drinking. 

Heres the weird thing though: about 2 years ago I fell at home (Over my cat no less) and landed straight on my knees (ow) and the next morning woke up with a knee pain like no other. I was taken to ER where they said I was fine and sent me home. The knee pain from that point on would come up randomly after I drank certain things. Tequila and sugary alcohols were the worst but usually the pain wouldnt come. It is literally random and feels like my knees have fire crackers in them. Its also moved to my ankles and left hip too but still just comes at random. I could drink on and off for days and feel fine not even a hangover but suddenly randomly I can drink and wake up with the pain. Ill admit there are times when Im less hydrated than I should be before, during and after drinking but I wouldnt think that would make so much pain. 

I worry about AVN because I didnt know drinking while on steroids could cause it (says specifically can be caused by heavy drinking and long term steroid use) I didnt know the disease existed. 
I had bloodwork done by my primary doc last week and he didnt point out any irregularities though....

I dont know, I fear that my past 2 stressful years of heavy drinking because of my health and being on steroids may have given me irreversible damage. Im drinking much less now than ever before (2 to 3 times a week but still much less) and hadnt felt the pain in months before it suddenly came up again 2 days ago after having half a bottle of vodka one night. Next morning my hip and knees felt like fire crackers again...I want this to push me to drink even less but cutting it down to at most 3 nights per week was already a huge step for me that I was proud of. My doctor had reassured me as well that I was doing better  (I even began losing weight thanks to drinking less!) So its crazy to me how Im just now discovering AVN and how specific it is to my pain...like I said I had a clean bloodwork test about a week ago but Im not sure if stuff like this shows up in that. Anyway sorry for the long post i suppose I needed to vent.

TLDR: Was doing better with drinking but have also been on steroids for 3 years and now fear I may have AVN and Im scared",2,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41228852}"

My problem is this: I like to drink, and when I drink, I have a hard time stopping. I don’t have to drink everyday. However, when I do drink, especially when I go out at the weekend with friends, that's when there's some problems.

 Sometimes I go out for the night knowing I'll get drunk. Once I start drinking, I just lose control and can't stop. I like to keep drinking and drinking and get more drunk till I get wasted and lose all control.

 One time I've gone out for a few drinks and blacked out, basically sleeping on the bar table all alone and the bar was about to close around 5 am, the waiter saw my phone ringing on the table and answered, talked to my mom (after hundreds of missed calls she was worried to death), told her which place I was at, so my family came and picked me up. I dont remember any of it. Another time I blacked out, woke up next day at home and saw that I have bruises on my face and scratches all over my neck and have no idea what happened. 

This is obviously a problem.  It is causing problems in the family, my mother is worried sick every weekend when I go out because after some drinks I lose control and I dont answer my phone, she stays awake waiting for me at home shaking till 4-5 am sometimes. She is really on the verge of losing her mind worrying something will happen to me. 

I want to stop this but I really can not control myself once I start drinking. I was wondering if psychotherapy would help? I also looked up the medication called Naltrexone, which some folks use in conjunction with the 'Sinclair Method'... it blocks the excessive dopamine response from drinking, and makes overconsumption psychologically much less appealing..

I realized finally that I suffer from terrible PTSD as a result of all of my trauma and that has been a massive reason behind my drinking. With the pandemic that’s been going on and after my ex left I started drinking again. In the past few weeks it’s been very heavy-not every day, but I’ll binge very hard liquor on occasion or drink beer or wine. I’m scared I may suffer from withdrawal symptoms. Last night I got into an argument with my current boyfriend because I’ve been so stressed from work. I’m an essential and I’ve been highly overworked, stressed and exhausted. I’ve even been getting ill. I also tend to just get upset and angry because of how verbally, emotionally and physically abusive my ex was. I’ve the next few days off and I want/need to make a plan to stop. I can’t hurt my new boyfriend like this because I love him so much. It hurts me so deeply that my issues have caused him pain. I just need help and support. I have tried AA before and it’s simply not for me. I am hoping for a different route.

For about 10 years I struggled with Binge drinking. Black out drunk a lot. I got sober for about 6 months. I was so happy.I started falling off the wagon a bit. Nothing like before. But it was happening bit by bit. Then this whole covid situation happened and I'm in a really bad place. I am living with my husband and parents. My husband and I help support my parents.

Prior to Covid, I was really getting my life together. I had 2 jobs I was excelling at. Good shape. About run my first 5k. Regularly going to the gym. I was drinking again, but life in general was so much better. Waking up at 6am everyday.

Then there is life post covid. Everything I had to work towards got cancelled. Furloughed from both jobs. I have thankfully been ok financially. But it feels like everything I fought for has been stolen. I was in a place where I was excited to get out of bed. And now everything just feels empty and pointless. I miss my life. A lot. And it looks like with the ""new normal"" safeguards, it's never coming back. Putting all of your self worth in something just to have it all not matter. It's a struggle to get out of bed. My hobbies are really hard to do.

My drinking has been extreme. My family doesn't know. I hide it well. I am gaining weight back. Last weekend I drank heavily again. I spent an entire day with the worst hangover I ever had. I threw up for the first time in about 6 years. Chest pains. Had the shivers. NO one in my house knew. I passed it off as a migraine. I am scaring myself and I know I am killing myself. I hate it. I want to stop. But facing this new reality seems way too big of a task sober. I just want to wake up from this nightmare but it keeps going on. I drank again today. No where near the other day. I made it 3 days sober which is more than I have done since quarantine started. I was tempted to drink last night but fought it and was excited to wake up clear today. To end up feeling unmotivated and ended up drinking. What is the point of getting sober if facing this situation with no life or distractions persists? I have access to parks to exercise, I'm an artist but life just feels pointless right now. I am trying to move past it. But some days are so dark.

What's the point of even trying to get sober when life seems to have no meaning or purpose? How do I manage to make myself not drink when I will inevitably  fail in two days? I don't even like drinking.

Even though I’m low on money I still find reasons to justify my drinking, such as “it’s not that expensive and I can still afford top ramen if I buy this alcohol.”. I have a general disdain and dislike of their people and cut off any possible conversation with others, unless it’s absolutely necessary. I just want to know why I’m unable to have empathy for others or even care about people trying to have a conversation with me. All I think when they try attempting a conversation is to say what they want to hear until they leave me alone.

I joined AA about a year and a half ago, and it kind of worked for a while. I was going to multiple meetings a week. I got roughly 6 months sober at one point, and I just got that sobriety time because I was working about 55 hours a week and didn’t have time to drink. I had a sponsor that I talked to every day, and she was super helpful. Around November, I had started drinking again, and in December my sponsor relapsed so she could no longer sponsor me, and I dropped out of the program. 

I thought I could handle my drinking. I was just drinking a little bit a few times a week. I gradually started drinking more and more, and I didn’t notice how bad it had gotten until the first time I was up for 24 straight hours drinking. Now, it is not uncommon for me to either be drunk for over 24 hours straight or be actively drinking for over 24 hours. Before I joined AA, I was drinking a lot harder than I am now. I would go through serious withdrawals if I only had 2 bottles of wine. My organs hurt all the time, and I didn’t even know what it felt like to not be drunk.

It isn’t quite that bad again yet, but I feel like I’m not far off. The longest consecutive time that I have been sober all year is 4 days. I don’t know if I have really started going through withdrawals again since I don’t have the shakes or cold sweats, but I am definitely detoxing.

I will only drink from about 10pm at night when I play video games with friends, and then stop around 3-4am when everyone hops off. But I do polish off that full amount during that time frame almost each night. I work our 5-6 days a week and try to eat healthy and drink lots of water as well on a normal basis. I recently (this past Thursday) went super hard for my buddies 21st at his house, and woke up with the worst headache/shakes in the world. I did not drink anything the entire day and was able to get through yesterday after taking two THC edibles to kill the slight shakes, sweating, anxiety, and brain fog. It has now been 60 hours since my last drink and I feel much less anxious (although I’m still slightly anxious, but this is somewhat normal for me). Also, my heart rate and chest pains have subsided to the point I can only barely notice it. I am curious if I was withdrawing from alcohol and was able to feel better this quick? I have other occurrences where I was foggy headed and felt the other aforementioned symptoms, but never took a full two days off as I decided to just go drink again. Now, over two days without a drink and feeling much better, I am wondering if I’d be able to enjoy a few beers with my family on this Mother’s Day without having to go through those feelings again tomorrow. I would plan on not drinking anything close to the 15-20 drinks a night I had been doing a few days ago, maybe 6-8 drinks at max (all beers, no liquor at all). Would this be possible, or is there a bigger underlying problem? Or should I give it a shot and if it happens again, then I know I need to abstain from alcohol altogether, even if I end up feeling better after 60 hours without a drink. I hope this makes sense and thank you all in advance for all your help! Happy Mother’s Day to all you Mamas out there as well!",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46561834}"

It started when I was old enough to drink so of course it was new and excited and all the cool kids did it. Then when everybody celebrated graduation and partied, I was in hospital fighting for my life. Since I got the diagnosis for a chronic disease, my drinking just got worse. It was like i was trying to show everybody that even though I'm sick I can still enjoy life just as much as others my age. Swallowing medication with a cocktail. Partying 5 days in a row with no stop. Joining a students club and bartending. Alcohol was always around me. It didn't seem strange to drink. Everyone else around me was drinking... But the more time passed the more I realized: I'm drinking out of the wrong reasons. Not (only) because that cocktail tastes good. It was cause it made me forget. It made me happier. Open to new people. It made me into the person I want to be. Happy, open, fun. But nowadays I realized I've been also drinking every time when I'm stressed. Like just a little pressure and I crave a beer so bad. Just today, I have to finish a paper with a group and I feel stressed and have anxiety. So I already drank 2 beers. Just to take of the edge. That's a problem. THAT is not who I want to be...

But what do I do now? I feel weak. I can't imagine a life without alcohol. I really just want to be able to drink for the 'right' reasons. Like a wedding or a nice dinner. I want to stop overdoing it. But I don't want to quit alcohol. Is there like a happy medium?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44656304}"

He drinks multiple vodka & juice a night, and is in complete denial.. he actually think it’s helping all of his problems!","I’m 22 and still live with my parents and older brother. My dad has always been a drinker, growing up it was always just a glass of wine at dinner, now it’s changed to vodka & juice, but multiple glasses every night.. and no exaggeration when I say “every night” -I’ve never seen him NOT drink at night. I know he’s addicted because 1-he sees nothing wrong with his consumption yet EVERYONE I’ve talked to about it (professional & not) has told me his consumption is not the ‘normal’ amount/he could be considered a heavy drinker.
But I think he’s one of those high functioning alcoholics; like he’ll stay busy even while drinking-although his motor skills are impaired & his moodiness isn’t fun to be around..
I have tried talking to him a few times about it (I’m a very shy person & he’s an angry guy so it’s difficult for me to build up confidence to speak to him about something he’s so defensive about), but every time I express my concern & the facts about alcohol that are actually harming him (he has a bad back+knee, gets shit sleep, is moody and pissy often, and is an asshole to my mom but can’t see it), he gets extremely defensive and tries to like combat my response by saying things like “well if you smoke weed a lot why can’t I drink a lot?” Which, I’m sorry, but that’s not an accurate comparison at all. Totally different drugs. That’s what I think he doesn’t get, that every drug is different, and the fact that people get addicted to certain substances, does NOT, at ALL, mean they are equivalent to one another. 
What can I do to actually ‘wake him up’ to help him see?
I mean, for god sakes he has terrible liver damage, and questions why he does?
You can probably tell now that I’m on the more pissy side of this, mainly because alcohol is SO WIDELY ACCEPTED YET THE MOST DANGEROUS DRUG. And the fact that since it’s socially accepted, that he always has people/things to ‘back him up’ and defend him. But really it’s just him falling for the trap. 
And yep, I hate alcohol myself. Have gotten drunk maybe once in my life, and have had a few drinks but I absolutely hate the feeling of the acid in my stomach from the alcohol.

I wish I could have a calm conversation about it to him, but it never has happened and don’t think it will; he’s too defensive. He like believes it to be the miracle drug that fixes all his problems...... but in reality, it’s the CAUSE of all of his problems!!
He jokingly says all the time too: “eh I’ll probably only live for a few more years til my liver gives out” ...... like wtf, you don’t ever say that to your kid??? Even if I am 22 years old, that’s a fucked thing to say. 

I just need him to get help because he’s making my families & his life miserable as well as mine. It’s so unfucking fair how something so deadly & widely accepted just because people enjoy it... like just imagine if it was heroin everyone was doing and was widely accepted ... think about that.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8166708}"

2020-05-10 03:46:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ggx8fp/i_want_a_drink_so_bad/,I want a drink so bad,"Right around 2011 my best friend bought a bar. We lived in a small town that mostly had choices such as Bud Light, Miller, Coors, Keystone, etc. Him and I were both beer snobs so he introduced the town to Sam Adams, Left Hand brewery, a lot of the bigger named domestics and honestly when he opened the bar he was able to get damn near anything he wanted. If he or I wanted to try a beer he'd just simply order it.

Business was booming so he'd invite me in around close and we'd sit in the back knocking back a ton of beer. I'd get completely hammered to the point where I could barely walk, my wife would take me home, sometimes I'd pass out, sometimes I'd vomit, sometimes I wouldn't even come home we'd have his wife come pick us up and we'd go back to his place and I'd sleep it off there.

My wife and I get pregnant and we decide to move back home about two years later. My drinking is just out of control now that I'm drinking virtually as much as I want for free damn near every night. We get back home and I'm managing a restaurant. We'd close down around nine or ten PM and it was in a pretty busy town with lots of night life so a few of us would head over to the local bar, usually the district manager, the owner and myself maybe a few employees here or there. I ran the place so I worked atleast five days a week and usually six. It got to the point where when I walked in the manager of the bar would just get my beer ready and call in my food order the minute they saw me.

It keeps going and now I'm not drinking for free but the owner of the restaurant is buying a ton of rounds and I'm paying out of pocket but I'm making double the money I was before so I don't feel it financially. Time goes on and the wife and myself are arguing like crazy. I'm never home, when I do come home I'm drunk and on my days off I'm always looking for an excuse to head out to the bar. I remember I secretly refused to get cable ""because I don't want to waste money"" and then I'd always say ""there is a sports game I want to watch I'm gonna go out and watch it at the bar"".

One weekend she goes to her sisters a few states down and stays a week, she comes home and I'm nowhere to be found. I told her I was working late when in reality I was at the bar, she calls the restaurant and nobody answers, I of course tell her I didn't hear it, I still stay at the bar all night. I think I got in around three am that night. She told me the next day she was leaving me and didn't want me to come back home. I spent that entire day begging and pleading with her to stay. At around nine or ten that night she finally agreed under the condition that I get my drinking under control.

I went out that night, had a glass of water and haven't had a full beer since. That was in November six years ago this year. I had a beer at the Super Bowl the next year, I took one drink, set it down and never picked it back up. I haven't so much as touched a bottle of beer since.

Some days are harder than others. If somebody comes out with a new beer I wanna try I think to myself ""man I just want a small taste"" but I don't. Or the other day the grocery store was closing off certain aisles and we got funneled down the beverage aisle and it was hard to keep walking and walking and walking before finally getting away from it. No matter if its easy or hard I've always done it and without too much of an issue.

My wife has had some numbness in her face and some blurry vision the last few weeks, she got an MRI done and at 10:14 am yesterday she came home and broke the news to me that they found 30 lesions on her brain and that combined with her symptoms they are sending her to a neurologist and they believe its likely MS. I'm crushed, I've spent more time crying about this than she has, I love her so much that I went from getting falling down drunk daily to not touching a beer at all virtually over night just so I wouldn't lose her and now I feel like I might still lose at the very least a lot of her, her kids will lose some of her and all I can think about is how thirst quenching, how great a beer would taste right now. Just heading out to the nearest store and picking up a few craft brews that'll go down so smooth.

I won't ever do it because I know that she needs more of me now than ever and my kids (who don't even know yet) need me now more than ever. I guess I just typed up this whole thing as a mindless rant about how much I still think about drinking even though I know without a doubt I can never so much as touch another bottle of beer.

Edit: I was really in my feelings and really craving a drink when I typed this. It was like five am, on mothers day, virtually 24 hours since we got the MRI results. I was tired, stressed, emotional, craving a beer badly and I had honestly forgot I wrote this. I think my emotions just poured into my fingers and this came out. I want to say THANK YOU to everyone here. I honestly did not expect anyone to notice this and I even mention it was just my own mindless ramblings. Now I'm tearing up over the support you guys have all shown me, its incredible how complete ""digital strangers"" can make you feel like superman. Thank you guys, I'm no longer craving a beer, I made coffee for the wife and I this morning and that hit the spot just fine. I'll never touch a beer again it almost took away my life but there are days, hours, minutes that I want nothing more than a beer. Its times like those I'll remember this support. These days the moments are few and far between and rarely last more than a lingering moment but I think we all know how powerful those lingering moments can be on our psyche.

2020-05-10 03:42:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ggx73f/withdrawals_or_general_anxiety/,Withdrawals or General anxiety?,"Hi all,

So I got diagnosed with General anxiety disorder 10 years ago after my first ever panic attack sent me into a bad spiral of anxiety. I went agrophobia and everything. I soon found out that alcohol helped me feel relaxed and normal again, so for the last 10 years I have used alcohol to self medicate. Sometimes drinking up to 100 units a week and sometimes drinking 14 units a week and last year went about 3 months without any at all because I got really into fitness by mountain biking. I dont really remember having any withdrawals it just kind of naturally tapered off. I came off my bike in quite a nasty fall and ended up having one bottle of wine one night and slowly got back on it. My worst nights would usually be a bottle of wine and about 4 beers and my normal nights at the moment are between 3-6 beers. 500ml 4% lager and this does still help my anxiety, even after 2 cans of lager I feel my anxiety start to subside so not sure if I have really grown a high tolerance or what. I have set myself a task since last monday of not having any more than 4 cans a day. And have kept to it...on monday I had 1 can, tuesday, 2 cans, Wednesday 4 cans, thursday 2 cans, Friday 2 cans and yesterday 4 cans. I guess my question is, apart from really bad anxiety (that I have alot anyway) I seem to be sleeping ok, I dont seem to have any shakes. I'm not sure if by now after a week of lower drinking I should have felt some withdrawals by now other than anxiety? I stick to drinking inbetweeners 1PM and 6PM and somedays have felt it hard to wait till 1PM but only because i feel so anxious. I feel like reading about alcohol withdrawel alot and putting so much pressure on myself to stop is making me super anxious and that it's probably not from any kind of withdrawel? If you look at the time I started drinking my 4 beers on wednesday I had gone 48 hours on 3 beers and slept ok and and was not shaking or anything. So I dont know if in just overthinking this and if I haven't experienced any major withdrawals by now from cutting down then I should be ok? And ingact it's me just constantly thinking about it and panicking about it that's made me feel this anxious. 

Last saturday for instance I had a pretty anxiety free day and i only had 2 beers by choice in the evening g and my wife had another drink and I said I wasnt bothered. It wasnt because I was trying to stop myself from drinking another, I just didnt feel like it. So not sure if I'm an alcoholic who is fooling themselves or actually I just am over thinking this and with the amount I drink I shouldn't really experience withdrawals so to stop worrying?

I tested positive for antibodies and was giving the clear for me to get back to work. I'll be taking the swab test again next week for peace of mind. However for the past two days my withdrawal symptoms from Alcohol has kicked in.

A little background on that. I'm 34 and have been a heavy drinker on and off for about 15 years. I've been hitting it hard for the past 5 or so. I was intoxicated when my wife noticed I was burning up. I didn't feel it cause, you know, intoxicated. Fever was over 102 so I stopped drinking. Fast forward two weeks and the fever is gone and the symptoms are better so I decided to drink again. I only did it for the one day and I had a hangover the next. No relapse of symptoms though. It's been ten days since I've drunk but the cravings are back. Not intense like 10 days ago but I think it will get there.

For the past 2 days I have had a little throbbing sensation in the back of my head. This happens when I'm craving alcohol. I also feel like my brain is cloudy and my body feels sickly. I know it's not the virus cause no fever and my eating is fine. Plus I'm craving alcohol. My question is has anyone felt like this after going a week or more without alcohol?

Before all this Covid-19 shit, I was drinking almost every night, but sometimes I just smoked a joint and/or use melatonin (Monday - Thursday) to help me sleep: usually a 750ml bottle of wine or 3-4 cans (12oz) of Strawberritas (8% alcohol).
On weekends, I pregamed at home with a fifth (40%), which would last me all weekend, and then usually drink only beer at the bar Friday and Saturday night. 
The fifth I would buy would last me all weekend, and I didn't usually drink any of it in the mornings because I'd usually smoke a joint if I had a hangover.
This was all when I was working and not quarantined.

Last week: Started drinking one or two small 250ml bottles of liquor everyday. 

This week: I've had a fifth (750ml) everyday for four or five days in a row drinking all day. 
On the last night, I vomited and I couldn't sleep. Light sweating, anxiety. No shaking. No hallucinations. 
I'm sure it wasn't a hangover. It felt like a very mild cocaine crash.
I got hydroxyzine (for anxiety and itchiness) and painkillers. Unfortunately, I didn't realize I should taper off during the withdrawal.
The withdrawal lasted almost 48 hours. Right now I just have a slight headache despite the ibuprofen. 

Question: Will I have withdrawals again if I return to my previous lighter drinking pattern? 
Everything I've read has said I need to stop drinking completely now that the withdrawal is over. 
Honestly, I wanna cut back to drinking only on the weekends from now on.

The most I’ve done drunk are post embarrassing Instagram stories or send texts that were embarrassing that I forgot I sent. With one exception which I’ll mention later in this post. 

My drinking habits before the lock down were mostly a series of binges at parties or out with groups at bars. Sometimes drinking 6+ beers and mixing in some hard stuff. However since lock down I drink almost every night. I don’t binge every night but I do have a couple of martinis or G+Ts. I do tend to binge once a week tho, usually when chatting on the phone with a friend so it’s like we are hanging out (ie not binging alone). 

I have a friend that *does* have a drinking problem. She’s gone to AA. Usually a 6 pack or more a night. She is ill every morning from it. Like can’t move for the first few hours of the day. She throws up every day. She has lost jobs from this. Had sex with people she regrets. Huge public embarrassments. One time she cut her head open drunk. This adds to my confusion. I’m not as bad as her, no where close. But is it even helpful to compare on this sort of thing?

I drink to get buzzed and stay buzzed. One drink is useless to me. I have a lot of social anxiety and drinking seems to make me an extrovert when I need it to. I have actually had positive results from social drinking at networking events. I’ve gotten dates. I’ve made professional connections. 

Now for the downside. I had two major incidents where I got black out drunk in unsafe places. These happened within months of each other. One in the summer of 2016 and one in Nov of that year. It was a hard year for me in other respects and i turned to booze to deal with it. The first one I let a stranger put his hands down my pants at a bar. It was a brown out so I wasn’t sure what all I let him do. I woke up with a hickey I didn’t remember getting. The next one in Nov. involved me hitting on my friend and trying to kiss her and just over all being too much. I also don’t remember the extent of what I did and that haunts me. But she stopped talking to me after that and while she has forgiven me, she still doesn’t want anything to do with me. I still haven’t forgiven myself. I don’t know how to forgive myself. 

These were my worst moments. I quit drinking for several months after them. And I started therapy. 
Then I started drinking again without major incident. No black outs since. The only bad results being the embarrassment and Shameovers I get because alcohol is a depressant. I often wake up hating myself for no particular reason. It fades away within hours of waking up and I’m back to normal. 

There is one thing that does concern me now is a feeling I get a few times a week. I get this tightening in my body and I get extremely frustrated. My brain just says “have a drink. Relax. You’ll feel better” and I do. This tightening is like a physical manifestation of compulsion. I’ve heard of urge described as a wave. You can either ride it out and it will pass or give into it. I usually give in, because riding it out is super hard. and at that point I’m kinda pissed and short tempered until it’s over. I’m not sure if that is a actual clue that I might have problem or if people just *have urges sometimes* and that’s ok. 

A little more pertinent info, then I’ll end the post. I have low self esteem and tend to catastrophise things. I see myself as broken in someway I can’t put a finger on. My therapist says often times people make problems for themselves when they aren’t there. Like I said, I have no other alcoholics in my family. And I don’t know where this could come from. And I’ve never had it affect my work or my relationship with my wife. I also am a perfectionist. I see these small embarrassments as ruinous. If I had a different, more chill, personality It might not even occur to me that I might have a problem. 

What I’m confused about is this. Am I an alcoholic? Should I be distancing myself from this or am I just finding a new thing for myself to feel ashamed of? I compulsively beat myself up, I think it comes from some bullying my dad did to me growing up. 


The simple fact is, I enjoy drinking. I think it’s fun. It’s also still so ingrained in my age group Id have to relearn how to do a lot of things which I dread even as I write this. 

I know the fact that I’m on this Sub posting this must mean something. But I just don’t know. I’m of two minds about my relationship with drinking. I don’t want to stop unless I should. I just don’t know if I should. Does that make sense? Please help.

My accountability partner asked what I was going to do to celebrate and...I don’t really know!  It’s both a big deal and not a big deal.  

So I’ll share some of what I have leaned and what I know now, that I didn’t know 9 months ago.

Moderation is absolutely not an option for me.  If I was going to be able to drink moderately I would have done that by now.  I wouldn’t have become an even heavier drinker as I progressed through middle age.

The cravings don’t go away but they do lessen and you develop ways of thinking to deal with them.  Even today, though, as I hit what is a significant milestone for me, the little voice in the back of my head tells me sweet little lies.  It suggests that I should celebrate this with a drink, especially since things have been kind of boring lately.  Play the tape forward.  I know how bad, how ashamed I would feel tomorrow so I will get through today without drinking.

I look better.  Especially around the eyes.  I was always dark around the eyes and I told myself that hey, no one probably notices.  I can see how my eyes looked in pictures going back some years.  Other people noticed, I guarantee!

My relationships are better.  Especially with my immediate family.  I would have been impossible to live with through covid if I was still needing to drink.  I’m sure I’d be divorced by now.

Someone else out there is feeling the exact same thing as you and experiencing the same thing.  This community has really shown me that and there have been so many times where I have read peoples posts and I may as well have been reading about myself.  Thanks so much to this great community for all the support you bring!",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.39990145}"

please read this all and give advice, im so shocked a d would love to hear others’ views on the situation.

also sorry for any mistakes, writing this while shaking, on a phone, at 12 am.

so Me= me (13) mum = my mum sd= step dad bro= my brother (20) sis = sister (16)

today since about 12 in the afternoon my mum and sd have been getting drunk and sitting with the neighbours. ive been playing minecraft and didnt realise the time so i came down to get dinner at about 9 because i hadnt eaten anything. being a 13 year old who loves eggs i made an omelette (dont judge).

halfway through, with the hob on and everything, my mum walks in, completely pissed, amd switches off the lights, with me burning myself, burning the omlette and having to clumsily make my way to the switch to turn the light back on.

my sis, mum and sd are all completely smashed, and my sis throws up in the garden and my sd passes out in the living room. my mum keeps trying to get outside and wander off, which she manages to do once, getting halfway down the street before i stop her while my bro is helping my sis. my mum keeps insisting my bro lets go of her cuz now hes trying to stop her from getting outside. shes pushing him around and shouting at us, while me and my sis are sitting there scared and crying. my bro has had enough and says hes going for a walk, so i run down the street after him in nothing but pyjamas, because he was the only other one sober and to be honest, i didnt want to be in that house either.

so now were sitting on the road crying together and shaking, with the neighbour watching through their blinds. so i convince him to help me deal with the situation, because im really bad at handling stuff like that. he does and my mum is still screaming and pushing us about, swearing saying that she needs her phone (it was in her hand) us 3 were sitting there scared af. i have never in my life seen my mum that drunk, and shes sat on me before, without realising i was in the chair she wanted to sit on. i feel like im going to throw up. oh did i mention earlier on she dropped a knife on my which cut my chin open and elbowed me in the cheek? yeah, she was pissed out of her mind.



now i know this is ridiculous but the thing i was the most worried about was her threatening to take my phone, because incase things escalated i wanted to be able to call the police (and i had a friend comforting me, i was basically having a panic attack).
so now she is full on shoving my brother, who ive never seen so distressed, and to be honest, i now see him in a whole new light. if it wasnt for him, things could have gotten a lot worse, for example my mum could have gotten in an accident.


back to the story. my mum has now stormed off upstairs and somehow sd managed to get himself into their bed and was asleep, so my mum woke him up and started full on screaming and shrieking at him, saying how this was his fault, even though he had done nothing. we felt bad so we got her to stop, which resulted in her going back to screaming at us.


im gonna cut it short and summarised what happened next because this is already really long, and well i sort of cant remember much cuz i was so scared of my mum. she kept trying to hug me which made me back away cuz i was so scared and she kept just giving my sis and bro a blank expression while they tried to get her to bed. blah blah blah we all go to bed my sis throws up on herself i clean her up the end.

Hello. I'm at my wit's end about this and I have turned to the internet for help.
I'm on mobile, so apologies for formatting issues. Throwaway account.

My (20F) dad (46) used to be a smoker for at least a decade. About 6-7 years ago, he experienced some pain in his chest and went to the doctor. He was fine but the incident left him shaken and he stopped smoking. 

A year or so after that, he started drinking. I don't know how (I think one of his colleagues persuaded him to). At first it was one beer every once in a while. Then he slowly got addicted. After a while, he would even bring beer cans home to drink after the family would go to sleep. My mother (45) was distraught. She (and I) thought that with him not smoking anymore, he would become healthier. Instead, he took up this disgusting habit and has become addicted to it.

It has been roughly 4 years since he started drinking. We are worried about his health and we have tried to get him to stop many times. We tried the pleading/begging route. We tried the emotional what-will-happen-to-us route to appeal to him. We tried being angry and scolding him, hoping some sense would go through his head. Nope. Nothing.

Two years ago, he said he would stop drinking on my parents' anniversary. He hasn't and keeps saying he will stop on so and so date. These past two months he was sober due to everything happening and non essential shops being shut down. However, our government has allowed for liquor stores to open up this week and today he came home drunk after grocery shopping.

I keep thinking about finding a therapist or something but I am really out of my depth here. I am very scared for him and ourselves. Please please give me advice. I would appreciate any and all help given. Thank you.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6786784}"

Hello there,  


First off the obligatory: English is not my native tongue, so please excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes.  


I need some advice to handle a situation.  


Backstory: My sister died 4 weeks ago very suddenly and unexpected. While it hit everyone of my family hard, the hardest it has been on my brother in law.  


Before their marriage in 2008 he has been an alcoholic, but stopped (somewhat) after their marriage. Once or twice a year he would drink, they'd argue and then he wouldn't touch alcohol for half a year.  


Of course the death of his wife has put him in a dark place. On the day she died he started to drink and has been drunk every second day since them.  


He is on sick leave until the end of summer (disloacted disk in the spine, but the company is happy for him to stay on sick leave as in this case the national healthservice pays his wage, and they would have to reduce anyway because of the virus). So he sits at home and drinks; only leaves the home to take a walk with their 4 dogs.  


I have talked to him in the past about getting help, but here is my problem:  


He says he knows anyway. I get the sentiment, i really do. For 15 years i have been obese and i did know about a healthy diet, but i needed to reach out to other people to get the help to actually use my knowledge. Only with this was i able to loose a lot of mass.  


Maybe that is not comparable to alcoholism, but him saying ""I know all that, i don't need anybody to tell me."" hit me, as it was the same thing i told myself 15 years, without changing anything.  


As we live quite apart, i will only be able to visit him in 2 weeks, and i somewhat dread it, because i don't know how to talk to him about this problem, or if i even should given as his wife passed away only a month ago.

To add to that, there is a bit of a financial strain, and my parents helped out by making a payment for the car (6k) and i fear that they would also take over the rates for his house, because as it seems he doesn't plan to return to work (he wants to care for his dogs). The problem is, my parents are in their 70s and are also in a bad place due to the death of their daughter, but i fear for them. Especially, given that my brother in law has never really grown up, and his life was managed by my sister, and i suspect that he will let (or hopes) his life be organized by my father.  


I love my brother in law and want to help him, but i cannot risk the mental and financial well being of my parents.  


So, if you have made it that far: How do i breach this topic in a sensible way, or shouldn't i? Has anybody been at the place my bil is right now, and did you get out - and if so: how?  


(For reference, we're based in Austria in case there is some legal advice/helplines you want to recommend)

I read it can come on suddenly, especially after ingesting a lot of sugar. Well Im bulimic and eat probably a gallon of ice cream a day with chocolate, cookies. Etc. Also read “confusion and disorientation that continue well beyond the period of drunkenness” is a symptom and that’s exactly how it feels.

He'll promise all the time to ease up or at least tell me when he feels the need to drink, but he never follows through.

I know he's hurting and he's not able to control this. But what am I supposed to do? The constant deception and broken promises hurt. The lack of access to my best friend hurts. I feel like because I don't have a drinking problem I'm supposed to be strong here  and just suppress the anger and sadness of having to watch him fail and lie every damn day. But that is overwhelming sometimes and I blow up at him, causing him to feel ashamed.

I know from talks with my own therapist that I cannot solve this problem for him. But when is it time to throw in the towel and search for a better life for myself?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your kind words of support. I will definitely be seeking help from AlAnon  communities. A quick read of r/AlAnon shows that my situation is pretty typical.

It started about a decade ago; just having a beer to wind down before going to sleep. Then the beer turned into two, then three, then vodka/wine/anything. Now I have a very hard time sleeping without it.

I’ve only recently done some reflecting and I’m coming to terms with the fact I’ve been a long time functioning alcoholic. 
I have a good job, my bills are paid and I own a house. (I’m 25, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far... mostly)

I’ve been drinking every weekend since I was 18/19. 
At one point I was drinking every night, for probably almost two years. 
I realized that was “wrong” and stopped that but still justified my binge drinking on the weekends. 
 
Of course over time my tolerance increased and the negative memories of drinking outweighed the positive. Blacking out, getting sick more than people realized, hiding how many drinks I actually had, making excuses when someone called me out for being “tipsy”... you name it. 

I no longer want to be that person. I don’t want booze to have that hold over me anymore. 
In the past I’ve tried to cut back or even switch to something not as strong to slow myself down but with no success. 

No one around me told me I had a problem because from the outside I seem put together but maybe just like to drink a little too much.

I’ve never voiced these things to anyone before...and maybe reddit isn’t the best place. Who knows. 

I’ve found the book The Naked Mind by Annie Grace and so far it’s speaking to me on so many levels. I know people have mixed feelings about this book and I’m just wondering if any of you have any opinions on it? 

Thanks for listening to me ramble. This is all new territory for me.

Here's what has been helping me live a sober life.,"I just turned 30 yesterday. Obviously, my 30th birthday included some drinking I planned to get wasted months in advance).  I thought I could drink like I once did before, but I blacked out and fell asleep. It's sort of bittersweet. Bitter because of the hangover, sweet because I know I've changed my life for the better. Today I'm having drinks to ride out this hangover and then it's back to the sober life for me.   


**What's been working for me:**   


**CBD OIL**

I've been taking CBD oil daily. It takes away the anxiety and helps me not crave alcohol. It also helps my brain release endorphins so I'm generally always in a good mood.  Whenever I do cave and have a beer, it's usually 1 or 2 MAX and it's mostly for the flavor or to go to bed if I'm full of energy.  I can actually have a beer like a normal person, but this is only if I'm taking CBD oil. I recently ran out and I noticed I instantly started drinking again. I went from 2 - 4 beers a week to a 6 pack a day as soon as I didn't have it. But when I'm CBD I have to FORCE the beer down. It's like my body is completely uninterested. Results may vary!   


**Journal**

This right here saved my life. I've been keeping  a journal for the last 3 years and going back into it and seeing the difference between my sober life and my drinking life is eye opening. I realize that as soon as I start having drinks I start missing meetings, fail at my goals and literally piss away my money. Pro tip! Keep your journal on google drive. You wont lose it and you can go back and search for entries. For example I could search ""bottle of Jameson"" and find some interesting stories!   


**Dating** 

This is weird for me because I usually go out and drink to meet people, but I realize that's probably why I've been meeting such shitty people. I also realize that by me wanting to be an attractive person it pretty much requires me to not drink my life away and take care of myself. i'm also forced to be more accountable. I had no idea how many women I would start talking to only to disappear for weeks on a drunken stupor.   


**Grooming**

I had no idea how gross I was. I mean, I consider myself to be a pretty clean guy. I moisturize, my teeth are white and I keep a tidy beard. However while being sober I noticed how shit my skin became from drinking, I realized I wasn't brushing my teeth enough and my gums bleeding when I brushed them. Too many nights passing out without brushing my teeth. While I was drinking everything in my life was dilapidated. Now I take time out of my day to pamper myself.  


**Exercise**  
This is a no brainier. I got myself a workout app and my thing is just do a workout a day. Doesn't matter how long, just do something. USUALLY, once I get started I'm willing to put in a good 30 minutes or so and that's more than enough. I've been shedding weight without the extra carbs. 

  
**Investing** 

Anytime I think about going out for a drink (or staying and drinking through quarantine) I invest. I've got myself the Robin hood app and I've been buying stocks. For the first time in my life I am going week by week with money in my account AND IT'S GROWING. This has been the best part of sober life to be honest. At first it was difficult, because once I made more money I wanted to go spend it at the bar lol but now I just reinvest it.   


  
I know a lot of people get angry when you're not  teetotal. I understand. Maybe one day. I just genuinely enjoy a good IPA every now and then I'm grateful that I can now do that. However I must note that without CBD oil I probably would have to avoid alcohol altogether though. Mostly because I've noticed that any alcohol spikes my anxiety the next day.   


Also, I want to thank anyone that has commented on any of my entries. If you've given me solid advice you have helped me turned my life around and I appreciate that.

2020-05-06 06:50:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gehrj8/alcoholic_mother/,Alcoholic Mother," Hello to everyone, I am sort of a new person in this community, my name Danny and my words won't even be enough to express how deeply shakened I am at the moment I am writing this. I've been fightining Alcoholism in the family for over 8 years now. My mom has been to psychiatrists several times, we have tried acting nicely and we have been rough sometimes as well, so far nothing has helped. I feel like in certain moments she is even delusional, saying and doing things that make no sense. It also feels as if she is a pathological liar. A big part of the alcolohism is due to marriage problems my dad and she have had. My dad is also to blame but more or less he is trying to be a reasonable guy. 

 Also I would like to say that our town is not a big one and it is not really developed into dealing with people with such issues like alcoholism. We just have basic psychiatrist but of course regularly visiting one may present a financial issue to the family. Probably the worst part is that my mom owns a family mini market in our neighbourhood and often these alcoholic based tantrums with shouting and so on are spectated by passing by people or people in their homes. We've tried everything to get her to stay more at home with someone and not work from dusk to dawn (and especially to not have access to alcohol) but she refuses to do that, the only way possible would be through brute force (which is not an option). We've also tried reffering to several family members but they are ignorant or turn out helpless as well.  


I don't even know why I am typing this, maybe for consolation, maybe for solution. Another bad thing is that they don't realize how this affects me and my little sister, as we are in the beggining of our lives and people start talking about this and it more or less reflects on us. Sometimes I feel ashamed passing by certain people in my neighbourhood as they are aware of this issue.

For  me, it has always been binge drinking, or at least that is how it was at the beginning. Typical start, weekend drinking to excess and barely  remembering the night.

Throughout  university I was known for drinking, being a drunk when we were  partying. What people didn't know is I was drinking by myself before we  would even meet up, I couldn't feel confident without prepping myself  this way.

After university, I  suffered a traumatic death in the family. This actually stopped me from  drinking for a while, not because it was related to alcohol, but because  it crippled me with panic attacks and PTS so bad amazingly alcohol  wasn't even a thought.

I moved out  of the country and didn't drink very much for a good 7 months, the fear  of the anxiety attacks I would have after drinking kept me sober.

However,  I then moved to an entirely new country, I lived alone, I wasn't  working and there was a bar on every street. I began drinking a lot,  every other day, maybe 2 days in a row if I could. I'm a bar fly, I  would drink at home but then I'd have to get out, once I had the buzz. I  just wanted to sit in a bar and slam beers, alone was preferred, but if  I was already drunk I was open to the random bar company and 'friend'  making that happened from time to time.

I became pretty low but rallied myself, didn't drink and moved country again for a new job.

The new job kept me focused in the week so a became a Friday night binger again, regretting it every Saturday.

I'm  now currently at a new job in a new country in East Asia. I've been  here for about 3 years. I got drunk at every free opportunity. If I  don't have to be in work early I would smash beers at home skip dinner  then drag myself to work the next day. Weekends I would drink Friday and  Saturday night, to get drunk, always.

I  ended up moving into a new apartment with my girlfriend here, she knows  I drink but no idea of the level. I'm, like many others, a master at  hiding it. Friday evening I would say, ""oh I have this work thing."" Or,  ""I have to go see some friends."". Then I would go to a bar and just  drink as many beers as I could. Make my way home and crash, try and feel  half normal in the mornings. If my girlfriend was busy and out of the  apartment for an afternoon or evening, I would go get beers from a shop,  drink as many as I could, then dispose of the evidence before she got  back. If she twigged I was a bit drunk, I'd say, ""oh my friend came  around we had a couple of beers, just relaxed.""

I  knew I couldn't carry this on, there is only one way this is going. I  remember a couple of weeks back, lockdown video chat with the family.  Everyone was chatting lots of chaos, but I heard my sister say to her  husband quietly, ""I think (my name) is drunk."" I didn't say anything,  not even sure if anyone else heard, but I was angry she said it, angry  for no real reason because she was right, I was drunk. I guess just  angry at getting caught, because I always hide it, or hide how much I  have drunk. That was a bit of an eye-opener for me.

Anyway,  now my main concern, being 3 days sober is the irritability I'm  getting, I never argue with my girlfriend really, probably because I was  always hungover or feeling guilty, or going to say, ""Hey I'm going to  be out late tonight, I have this work meal."" and feeling bad.

Now  I feel easily irritated, I also quit smoking as I would basically binge  those with beers and the two feel too closely connected.

I  know this Friday I'm going to have a crazy rush after work to just go  to a bar and get drunk and start the cycle over again. But I'm going to  try like hell not to!!!!!!!!

I  want to change but I'm worried about the negative impacts of the  changing process. It's not going to stop me from making the change, and I  know ideally I shouldn't hide my 'growth progress' as I hid my problems  with alcohol, but I'm going to, I know that much. So advise on stress  relief and relieving that Friday rushing; "" I just want to get really  drunk one last time"" feeling would be great.

Anyway,  God Bless your poor mind and eyes if you read all of this, Just needed  to say it somewhere. Sorry for errors, I typed this in one long rant.

Over the past 3.5 years I’ve watched my dad practically throw his life away. I’m 19, my dad is in his mid 30’s.

I grew up from a single mother, meeting my nonbiological father when I was in kindergarten. Even though he wasn’t my TRUE father I wouldn’t consider him anything less. 

I was an only child until my brother was born, and then another, and then my sister who just turned 4. My middle brother was always my dads favorite, but there wasn’t anyone who wasn’t loved and played with and we always had someone to talk to.

My dad drank recreationally quite often, but it was never a problem. Sometimes he’d get drunk with his brothers/friends which was okay. He wasn’t an alcoholic by any means.

3.5 years ago my middle brother died in an accident. No one expected it. My dad was at work, me and my brother were both at school. I remember coming home after my relatives picked me up to the rest of my family crying upstairs, and I was the last to find out. 

Everyone was grieving as everyone would, and my dad drank more often. My parents began arguing more and more as time went on, to the point now that I don’t see any love between them. I barely see my dad now when he’s not working, and when I do he’s just mixing a drink and going back to his room. 


He barely knows any details about my life currently, nor my other siblings. He tries to stay involved with my sister but the rest of the family doesn’t really talk to him. I try my best but it is so ridiculously awkward and I never know what to say.

I’m talking to a man that care into my life, was my best friend for 10 years, and then was gone. What the hell am I supposed to say. No one taught me how to deal with this I don’t know what to do. These problems in life aren’t things you learn about in school. 

In one day I lost 2 people in my family. I have had mental issues even before this so you can imagine it’s harder now. I’ve had girlfriends, best friends, etc which have made it easier but I can’t tell anyone about this no one understands. I’m so sick of venting and explaining my life and all this stuff when all people can say back is “I’m sorry” or “I know how you feel”. It’s obvious they don’t. 

My father was a man who was so ideal. He would always be outside and active and doing things with me and my siblings. His disappearance has affected my brother as well. He became more reclusive and changed from the once outside, happy kid to an angry one who barely ever leaves his room.

As I grow up I’m going to college, leaving the house, not living there anymore etc. and I’m worried about my siblings, my mom, and others. I’ve tried my hardest to be there for them and I have a terrible relationship with my brother. I’m part of the reason he has anger issues because I messed with him so much as a kid. Once I leave I don’t know what he’s going to do, my mom has too much to deal with already and I just really wished my dad was there with him to help my brother. Once I leave I don’t know who my brother will play with or what he will do and that’s what worries me the most.

So now I’m sitting here on my basement floor, thinking about my dads physical and mental health depleting, and how the rest of my family is going to be able to handle it in the future.

Is there a tried and true way to quit? If not, what are our options?","Me and my brother live in different states but during the quarantine we’ve been staying together as a family. First of, when I arrived by bus at the town my parents live in my mom picked me up tipsie. I didn’t realize it until half way home when she started swerving. Luckily we got home safe. I found my father completely shit faced on the porch and I call him out on it. “This is how you greet your son you haven’t seen for months?” We had quite an argument, mom cried, he said some nasty drunk talk, but I stood my ground and he said he was impressed by me and slowed down. He got sober the next day and didn’t drink anything for 8 days. He was getting chills and sweating at random times due to the withdrawal most likely. During that time he said he wants to quit, he didn’t even feel like drinking, he was productive around the house, I was hopeful. He picked it up again but I caught him in the act and told him that he should be carefully. “I want to make sure you understand that you can’t stop with just one beer, you spiral out of control and become a different person”. He said not to worry because he’ll only have a little to relax after work.

    He’s impossible to reason with drunk because he’s a “real russian man that will do what he wants”, he calls my mom a pig for agreeing with me, and keeps stressing the point that if it wasn’t for him we’d still be living in Russia and be complete “nobodies”( we immigrated to the US in late 90s). He drinks almost every night after work and he’s tolerable and when he’s sober he’s a decent human being but, when he drinks it’s like he’s a whole other person. He starts feeling invincible, almost like a god complex, and becomes repulsive, childish, obnoxious, and if we meet him with any resistance he says not to argue with him and if we keep arguing he gets very angry and hateful. I just want to say and stress that he never gets physical!

Anyways, because my brother and I live our own lives in different states, my mom and dad have been living alone together for the last couple years. In December, my mom drove drunk and crashed into a pole. The car was totaled but she was fine. I talked to her and I believe she’s just depressed over dad being an alcoholic. I spoke to dad about it but he dismissed it as nonsense and said maybe mom is “giving him depression” and that’s why he’s drinking. Ugh 

Yesterday we had a nice little family trip to a cottage by a lake. Dad was already drunk from the night before and was still drinking. Everything was going gravy until dad decides to shoot a pistol in the air of the balcony to show my brother in the middle of the day on a Saturday. I lost it and yelled at him for being a drunk idiot. He went off on me saying he disowns me. Obv cops were called by neighbors and I had to talk to the cops. We got off with a warning but my dad spent the remainder of his time awake flipping off the neighbors yelling “fuck you!” We kept telling him to be quiet, mom said the neighbors did the right thing but he didn’t care. While I was bbqing mom somehow downed a bottle of wine within minutes. Parents passed out 2 hours after we ate at like 4pm and my brother and I left because there was nothing to do so we went home. We left them in the bed with some water bottles. But we made sure to take all the alcohol with us that was at the cottage. I get a call at midnight from mom saying dad is mad that we took his booze and says he’s going to kill her and he’s forcing her hand to drive back home to kill me and my brother(tho that’s not really a serious threat in this family,historically). At that point of the night I didn’t want to deal with it, I put all the alcohol on the kitchen table for him to find. They get home, he keeps drinking and everyone else goes to sleep. The next day he spent being drunk all day and telling all of us we have until tomorrow to move out of the house. He sobers up the next day and apologizes. I confront him about how I feel and stress the following points: 

1. I’m worried for his mental and physical health 
  2. I do not want to be around him when he’s drunk because of how obnoxious he is, especially out in public (he made quite a scene  drunk at a restaurant on New Year’s Eve and I reminded him of it) 
3. He has a serious problem that requires professional help (he tried quitting using some sketchy voodoo people in the past, multiple times)
4. Mom is hurting because of his drinking

His reply:

1. “I appreciate the support but stop making it sound like it’s the end of the world, I just drink and sometime I get a little carried away”
2. “I’m sorry son”
3. “Again it’s not that big a deal, just be nice to me when I’m drunk and I won’t get angry. I’ve tried professionals and they didn’t help” (the voodoo non-licensed quacks I mentioned earlier)
4. “Why are we making such a big deal out of this?!” 

At this point I want to simply state that it’s getting close to a point where he’s going to have to choose between drinking and his family but, I’m afraid that might be too aggressive and he’ll just ignore me and get defensive. I don’t know what to do. Is there a tried-and-true way to quit for someone that’s been drinking for 30 years? Even-though he goes from saying he’s done with alcohol to saying that he’ll never quit, deep down I know he wants to! As much as I care for my dads health, I’m afraid of leaving my mother alone with him because she’ll start drinking. She’s taking an antidepressant already due to menopause so when she drinks, the alcohol knocks her out. I’ve found her on the floor not being able to get up during my time home and she only had 3 shots of rum that she was marinading raisins with for the Easter bread thing. Ive never seen my mom drunk before in my life until I came home for the quarantine

If anyone can offer any advice on helping my dad quit I would be so grateful :)!",1,{'quarantine': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57436717}"
2020-05-05 18:23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ge7kp9/please_help_me/,Please help me,"Hello everybody,
I'm writing this because I am lost and a bit frustrated. I (24F) live with my boyfriend (22M) in a house with an alcoholic roommate (35M). He is my boyfriends co-worker in the Air Force and friend. Everytime he drinks he gets mad and starts drama. He usually apologizes afterwards but it happens every time. It's always over stuff that doesn't matter so I didn't pay attention to it. I hated how my boyfriend has to deal with someone like that, but I moved in anyway because it didn't happen all that often but now it feels like 2 or 3 times a week.  He's usually drunk and irritated when he comes out of his room.

Two weeks ago he witnessed me put my dog in the crate and then started yelling at me for being an animal abuser. He was exhibiting signs of being physically aggressive even though I knew he wouldn't try to hit me. I asked him to stop and he was past the point of reasoning and no one has insulted me so much in my life. I was very hurt psychologically, I took my dog in the car and drove away and spent the night somewhere else. Because I didn't want to be homeless I called the roommate back on the phone (at the advice of my boyfriend) and I read him a letter that I wrote and he cut me off and hung up after heavily insulting me. The next day I came back, he apologized for getting angry but the damage had already been done.

My best friend committed suicide on Thursday. I have been grieving his death for several days now. I went and got some of his stuff from his apartment and I was telling my boyfriend the significance of his clothes and memories. This was the day after I had found out about his death. My roommate comes running downstairs and starts demanding that my boyfriend cover his shift for the next few days. His shifts are 12 hours long. I can't get through this without my boyfriend. And my boyfriend wasn't going to cover his shifts for him just because he asked him to. He wanted to be there for me.

I had to deal with him on Sunday for about 30 minutes. He was so anxious/angry that he wouldn't go away. He didn't say a word about my best friend or his death. I had to put makeup on his shiner and be there for him emotionally when I had no way of dealing with my own emotions from the grief. My best friend was like a brother to me, he was beautiful, he was loving, sensitive, kind, amazing and this world is less wonderful without him. My boyfriend was sitting there on the couch trying to reason with him and the only way I could get him to leave was to convince him to go to CVS and get yellow makeup to conceal the shiner. I got an hour and a half to mourn my best friend until he came back and then I heard him yelling upstairs to my boyfriend that he didn't want to go to work Monday. I had to leave the room I was in and get out of earshot. It just hurt so bad and it was pissing me off that this day was about his stupid shiner instead of the amazing man who left us.

He needed his shift covered because he had a black eye from falling on his face after he got so drunk he couldn't walk. He has already been through a rehab program, court ordered to avoid a DUI. My boyfriend respected him for it but then later realized he was just in the program because it was mandatory. My roommate didn't want the military to see the black eye and think that he had been drinking again and get kicked out. If he gets kicked out for that he could have a hard time finding another job.

 I'm so tired of the toxicity. I'm so tired of the fact that he doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. He didn't even ask me how I was doing before he started causing a scene Sunday. He dishonors my best friends death. He is a sorry excuse for a military personnel. 


We have to continue living where we are because the place is so cheap (350 for each of us to live in an area around DC) and I can't afford anywhere else especially during the pandemic. I don't have job security and my hours have been reduced so I'm making just enough money to get by and apply to school in December. As a matter of fact, we are paying more for the room than we should be because the roommate was such a hardass and causing drama about it. He wanted us to pay equally even though we were living in the same room together whereas he got a room to himself and pays less than we do. 


The whole house is huge and we live with two other people, each person gets their own bathroom and there's two living rooms and a balcony. It's furnished too. So we're thankful to be living in a place so cheap but I could be saving 100 dollars more each month and that would make a difference in my savings because the pandemic has hurt my wallet.


I hate living with this guy. He doesn't want to get help. He's depressed, toxic (abusive perhaps??), and now I realize just how horrible it is to live with someone addicted to alcohol. He made it harder to deal with my best friends death the day after he died. He is causing a strain on my relationship because the stress is causing on my boyfriend.

My boyfriend broke down yesterday from the weight of supporting me through my grief, and dealing with him. My boyfriend said he needs to talk to him about it, and that's what we will do. I don't really see what else we can do in the situation and my bf has definitely talked to him about it before and nothing changed.

I don't know what to do about him. The damage has been done. He's on the lease until October.",3,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8621357}"

Just looking for some guidance I guess. Apologies in advance if it's long winded. I tend to get that way, and sorry if I just ramble or vent a bit, as I'm new to this.

My (37M) sister (40F) has a drinking problem that I've only recently become aware of. I don't live with my sister, but my mother does live with her, and she was the one who recently talked to me about it. She said she didn't want to discuss it with me before because she was hoping it would get better, but it sounds like it's really starting to affect my sister very badly.

Just to maybe help anyone who needs info, I'll sort of go over her routine drinking habit according to my mother/niece. For the past few years, at about 7 PM, both my sister and my brother-in-law would have a few beers. In the past year, that routine has changed into at 7 PM, they don't spend any more time downstairs with the family. They go upstairs and don't come down for the remainder of the night. My mother suspected they were just going up to watch tv and unwind before bed. Eventually my niece found out they have a mini-fridge up there, and that's when she also found the stash of empty cans and bottles. Several large black trash bags full of empty cans, and about 20 empty vodka bottles. So for the past year, they've been drinking until bed.  Since the stay at home situation, my sister appears to have began drinking from the moment she wakes up, while my brother-in-law still seems to be adhering to waiting until a specific time to start. **So as of now, she drinks all day from morning to night, and she's already drunk by 8AM to the point of not being able to have a rational conversation, and he joins in later.**

My sister has been aggressively confrontational with my mother and my niece (21F) non-stop for the past several weeks, but it really went off over the weekend, where my sister said absolutely vile things about just about everyone in our family, but she also got into trouble with her boss because apparently since working from home, she's been doing nothing but drinking and not doing any work. She ended up getting fired. When she was explaining the situation to my mother, she was playing the victim the entire time, and blew up at my mother and attempted to evict her. For informational purposes, my mother has Parkinson's and has lived with my sister for the past 5 years or so, but she pays them rent, has never once been late, and does them a lot more favors than they do her.

My niece has also been reaching out to me a lot in the past few days because I told her if she needs to talk about anything at any time, call me, and I'll be there to help her in any way I can. She called me on Saturday obviously really shaken up. Turns out my sister drove drunk to go to the store to get vape juice... My niece went with her because she was terrified that her mother was going to kill someone. My niece doesn't drive so she couldn't just drive her there, but her logic was that maybe she could at least make sure my sister didn't fall asleep or was paying attention to the road. I wish she would have just called the police, but my niece is terrified of my sister while she's drunk.

As of right now, she's lost her job and is destroying her relationship with the ones who love her, but she's going to end up killing someone if she's driving drunk, and I don't think I'd ever forgive her for that.

It breaks my heart hearing some of the things she's said about my mother and niece while she's drunk. I've already come to terms with knowing that she's likely not going to just get help if I say ""hey, I think you might have a problem..."" so as of right now, the plan is to help my mother and niece look for a place of their own. I need to talk to her about this, but as of right now she's been on a non-stop bender. I was hoping to try and catch her when she's not hammered, but that might not be realistic.

so may 1st was a huge day for me... it's been 1 year - 365 days since i decided to take control of my mental health and quit alcohol.

this year has been the most intense, at times traumatic, yet transformative year of my entire life. i was silently struggling with my ailing mental health & using alcohol to cope for so, so, SO long. over the past 4 years of trying to ""white knuckle"" my way to healing, i have been hospitalized in the ER over 20 times... just this time last year i went to the ER 3 times in 6 days due to my poor decisions of using alcohol to cope & suicidal ideation. the very last time i went it was by the hands of the police due to a welfare check. i have never admitted that on such a public level like this, ever. i finally went to in-patient treatment on may 1st and my life has dramatically changed for the better.

yoga has been one of the pivotal forms of treatment throughout my recovery journey. so much so that i spent the last year building a business plan, gaining two yoga teaching certifications, executing financial budgets, building a website, building a marketing brand identity, working with the city, creating partnerships and so much more to launch my business.

times are extremely tough right now with the pandemic but people need access to affordable, holistic health outlets especially after all this is over.

Always have been. I've been drinking excessively virtually every day for the entirety of my adult life (16-Present). Ive never been a violent or sick drunk, I keep to myself and my friends amd never did drugs. For years Ive been paranoid of the effects of chronic abuse and lost sleep worrying and now its come to a head in my first post. I feel abdominal pressure on my right side after drinking recently and it scares me as all sources point to the obvious; that my selfish addiction has ruined my internals. 

I dont know why I was always fascinated by drink when I was young. My friends from school did it every weekend, celebrities and rock stars I idolised thrived on lives of excess and are now old and grey still kicking. It wasnt that big a deal clearly, alcohol seemed to be the legal indulgence for anyone at all times with the cash for it. Then I left home for university to a town with no friends (I also wasnt any good at making them and I didnt need them to pound drink away). It was here, in modern youthful freedom, that I discovered that my wallet was the only thing stopping me from having a full case (12 440ml tins usually) of beer every day, sometimes twice. This went on for my whole University experience 3 years and a little bit of the time back home in my parents once I graduated. Understandably, I ballooned in size and weight and had no girlfriend or confidence to get one (aint had one before ever, was never confident). So I decided to walk alot for exercise, everyday. 4-7 miles depending on the playlist and eating healthier. I also realised that the streets of my homecity were littered with bars. I couldnt be gone long otherwise folk would get suspicious so I only ever sank three to four pints of the stuff before lazily dandering home. I would go to work the next day bright and early and repeat this routine until I was 23. 

I finally found the balls in my awkward, fatty self to meet up with a girl. We hit it off and dates were fun and wild and of course involved booze and dancing and meeting her friends and lots of concerts and club night with drink offers and sitting in with cans and watching TV, etc. the point Im framing is that alcohol has been there at every conscious or unconscious point in my small lonely life. Excessively. My friends associate any fun with it. My amazing first girlfriend who Ive lived with for three years now assures me ill be okay but lately Ive been more scared than ever of throwing away my life just now as its only really starting. I dream of being a dad and a husband with a home and a career but before that I had no dream at all except habitual alcohol. Im sorry if reading this is confusing and Ive left out a fair bit of context and melodrama, but I just would like to ask if anyone else is scared as I am or was- and could give me some advice.

He's had DUIs (more than 15 years ago), and also had explosive alcohol-fueled rage incidents including one that led him to quit alcohol completely for two years. 

When we first got together nearly two years ago, he was still drinking quite a lot (after work at the pub and heavily on weekends), but early on in our relationship, I asked him whether his drinking was something I needed to be concerned about, and told him I thought it seemed excessive. Over time, he cut back significantly, and these days he drinks in moderation during the week (1-3 beers a couple days a week) and still binge drinks on some weekends (5-6 or more beers over a period of 4 hours or more).  

Even though it's not excessive drinking, I am concerned because he doesn't have any real hobbies other than drinking beers with friends. I know it's important for partners to have time apart, but his ""me time"" ALWAYS includes drinking beers and he often won't give me an ETA of when he will be back. After many times over the past two years when he went sort of AWOL (going out and not telling me when he'd be back, or saying a time and then being hours later, or not answering his phone of texts when I was worried), I developed anxiety about him going out because I don't know when or in what state he will return. We have had some pretty nasty fights after he does come home and I have learned not to try to talk about anything important when he's been drinking. 

He gets defensive and tells he me doesn't want to have a curfew or feel like he's on a leash, and that's why he sometimes refuses to tell me when he'll be home (also because he doesn't know). It's not like he's coming home at 3 am or crazy late, but when he is out with his friends drinking on the weekend it is rare that lasts less than 4 hours and I'm sure he has a minimum of 5 beers during that time.

He tells me that he feels like I'm trying to control his life when I tell him I like to have an ETA or I look sad or worried when he says he going out. The painful memories of waiting for him for hours in the past make it hard for me to feel ok with him going out and saying he'll be back in ""a bit"", which is usually hours. 

I have read that if drinking is affecting your relationship then it's a problem. It's definitely affecting our relationship because it causes this power struggle whenever he wants to go out (also when we are out together and I am ready to leave and he's not). 

From my perspective it feels like he is choosing drinking over me, and being inconsiderate by refusing to let me know when he's going to be home.

But from his perspective, it feels like I'm trying to be his mom by wanting to know when he'll be home.

If he were out doing literally anything that didn't involve alcohol, I would have no problem with it. It's not that I'm trying to control his life or keep him with me all the time, I just have anxiety about his drinking and the disconnect it seems to cause between us. I have a really hard time relating to him and communicating with him when he's been drinking - he is unpredictable and gets paranoid that I'm mad at him (because I have been in the past), he'll be kind and loving one minute then cold and sorta mean to he next.

I don't know how to bring this up with him, or if I even should. A mutual friend I spoke with about this issue reminded me that the more I try to control his behavior, the more likely he is to react badly and potentially drink more/stay out later as an act of rebellion. But we're talking about a man in his late 40s, not a teenager! The friend also suggested that I just avoid my SO after he chooses to be out drinking and let him deal with those consequences of his actions. But what I want is for him to prioritize our relationship over drinking. I wish he had a different hobby so he could have independent alone time away from me doing something healthy instead...",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6764212}"

But I have some questions.,"Hi everyone. A bit over a week ago I had a seizure and I'm guessing it was from alcohol withdrawal. It was a major tonic clonic seizure and lasted like 3 and a half minutes, and left me with a nearly chewed through tongue and very painful back. Thankfully I fell on my chin and not my head and was fine. My dang tongue took the brunt of the dropping force I'm guessing. It's completely healed now though and I can taste fine and my tongue looks mostly normal. Went to the hospital to get a CAT scan to make sure everything was ok and they put me on Librium for a taper. I've been off the Librium for like 4 days now and feel fine.

The weird thing is, the seizure just kind of came out of nowhere. I had been drinking quite a bit every night for like 2 weeks and at the end of that started tapering down. I was off for like 3 days when the seizure happened.

What's so weird though is that I wasn't feeling any extra anxiety or DTs or anything you'd normally get from alcohol withdrawal when I had the seizure. I thought I was in the clear.

Is this normal? Have any of you had seizures from your alcohol use that just came on suddenly without you feeling like you were in withdrawal? I just have so many questions. It was so weird. I'm 22 and never had a seizure in my life before this or anything like that.

Been having brain zaps the last few days though that just stopped today but beyond that I've felt completely fine, no extra anxiety just my normal insomnia that I was using alcohol to self medicate every night in the first place.

Like, is it possible to have some weird neurological thing where you don't feel the anxiety of alcohol withdrawal but your brain is still in significant withdrawal?

It was just so weird. One moment I'm talking to my friend not even feeling a lot of social anxiety like you'd expect from alcohol withdrawal that's bad enough to cause a seizure, next moment I'm waking up on the floor incredibly confused and in a lot of pain from the seizure.

So weird (I know I keep repeating that, but seriously I'm so confused by this whole situation, I felt completely fine when the seizure occured). Obviously I'm going to stay away from alcohol now for a long time and may not ever drink again, it was such a bad experience.

This is my first-ever post to Reddit.

I am an alcoholic. By my family’s standards, I’m not. I would argue I was high-functioning until COVID happened.

My entire extended family is Irish Catholic (think lots of people, huge family gatherings and free-flowing booze), my parents had been high-functioning alcoholics (a bit less functioning now — they’re both still alive they just have a worse handle on it), and my full brother is/was a drug addict and alcoholic. (My half brother is the eldest and he was addicted to gambling, not drinking, but he’s out of the picture now.)
My boyfriend comes from a smaller family (no real extended family is in the picture) where his parents would have two glasses of wine a night maybe once every three months. He’s also been on his own since he was 18 as his family moved back to Japan and he stayed to go to college here in the US which he’s still in debt for, while my parents are somewhat wealthy and supported me for two years after college (which they also paid for) until I was more ready/able to move out on my own. (If it matters, once I moved out they stopped supporting me financially, but they would if I asked for help. I don’t want to be dependent on them.)

We don’t live near our immediate families, which frankly is fine — he talks to his family semi-regularly and visits once a year, while my family is about an eight hour drive away (we live in California) and I talk to them anywhere from once every two weeks to twice a week, with occasional texts.

We’d been planning on moving in together this past April for about six months (leases etc) and then COVID happened, which meant I moved in in March ahead of schedule to quarantine with him. Neither of us has children.

Quarantining has hit us hard and we are doing our best to follow it responsibly. We both lost our jobs and while we’re huge homebodies and gaming nerds, I really miss some of the finer stuff in life — like going out to dinner.  We get along great as we have the same hobbies and chat on Discord with friends pretty often, and we’ve been cooking a lot together which has been healthy for our bodies and our relationship.  FWIW, I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and he has been diagnosed with depression. The biggest problem we have is my drinking.

Before the lockdown, I kept my drinking more or less in check. I’d get drunk once a week, but I’d always have at least a glass of wine every day. I’d get blackout drunk once every six months or so, which was always unintentional. Part of how I kept the drinking in check was drinking while I was out with people, then easily cutting myself off and going home (public transit for the record). By the time I’d get home the urge to keep drinking would be pretty much dampened. (Didn’t always work, but worked more often than it didn’t.) I was also usually a happy drunk. I started an SSRI for the first time in my life a year ago and my tolerance for booze went down, but I’d gotten to a point where I could balance myself about six months ago.
Since quarantining, I don’t have my way of keeping myself in check. I’m getting drunk every other day, getting blackout drunk once or twice a week, and because I’m frustrated and anxious about everything (our circumstances, the state of the world and the US’ response to the pandemic, not being able to see friends, anxiety about money, my father’s failing health, etc) my behavior while drunk is very childish, mean, and petty. I am not like this when I’m not drunk.

I can’t go to the store multiple times a week because that seems irresponsible for the pandemic, but if I buy six bottles of wine at a time I don’t trust myself to not drink two and a half immediately. I end up going to the local 7-11 two or three times a week to get a bottle of wine, a case of Trulys/Whiteclaws, and a can of wine at a time.

He’s told me that on the one hand, he’s not used to drunks and drinkers; but on the other hand he gets anxious and nervous when I get drunk because he has no idea if Fun Me or Scary Me is gonna come out (and lately, Drunk Me is almost never Fun Me). He says I’m unpredictable, irrational, and at times borderline emotionally abusive. He’s also noticed I hit the drinks a lot harder immediately after talking to my family and he’s worried that there’s something deep-seeded about my family that I’m not facing (specifically my father’s mortality). For context, his last relationship was to an emotionally abusive woman so he’s very anxious about being manipulated. 
He also knows the behavior is specific to when I’m drunk, so I think he’s giving me more of a pass than I deserve.

I don’t want to hurt him or us, so I was hoping to get advice.

I’ve tried a few things to limit how drunk I get and I haven’t gotten blackout drunk since then (admittedly it’s only been a week...). I’m not ready to give up drinking. I know you have to want it in order for it to happen and I’m just not ready. I’m SO anxious for the day when lockdown lifts and I can get out of the house because part of me really thinks a ton of this is happening because of how we never leave the house anymore.

Honestly I don’t know what kind of advice I want. I fully expect to get ripped to shreds, but any type of advice is welcome.

I had a different dream but waking up out of her bed. I still live with her and he we HAD a good relationship but I can still feel the weirdness from her. She used to whisper in my ear weird stuf""f I get lost in your eyes"" and moan whenever my family aren't around. Until I called her out on it she pretends she doesn't know what I'm talking about.**

***My mom is a widow***\*\*.\*\* And she **drinks** a lot I also look like my father so whenever she see's me she'll randomly stare at me without saying words. She argues everyday about little things or be petty. Last year we all were arguing over nothing and my **brother had enough and said than why did you and \*me\* had sex!?** So I was confused because I never crossed my mind he would say such a thing. But lately I've been having supsisions that my **mom abused** me so much at a young age I'm thinking I'm sleep walking into her room playing out the memory trying to catch her on the act. But of course my **mom denies everything we say**. My brother had the nerve to use it against me.

I have a gaming career and so I play **deep mind games** with my opponent so kinda like chess. Sometimes it's hard to make accurate hard reads when I have that thought lingering around my head if my **abused** me or not. The whole vibe of the house screams something is up. And so now my family is playing a petty **mind game** and messing with my **reality.** They say nothing happen and then my brother would troll me with some hints which kills my soul everyday. I learn to forgive everyday especially how crazy people are now and days. But I would never expect my family would treat me like this. I've always been a healthy kid. Active, made straight A's and B's. Sometimes C's when I get lazy. My siblings were under achievers so I'm not surprised when my parents at the time show some favoritism

**I remember in middle school. The age where I was most sexually active and curious. But one day my mother found porn on her computer. She told me ""so you are a tiddy person huh?"" At that moment I don't remember saying anything. I was so embarrassed that she knew what I looked up. And again I bring it up and she says she don't remember. Few days later she would bring up something embarrassing that happen years ago. ( Yeah my mom is toxic ) I fear that I sneak in her room every night or something. Trying to catch her on the act like I said before. I have been sleeping fine but I overthink this everyday so it has drain me. I wanted to do a lie detector on her but I feel like I would be wasting money if I already know the truth. She's a retired veteran so she thinks everything she does is right because she has money. And to rap this up. I don't want her to destroy the person I original was. A lover not a fighter. She mad me into an ugly person. I cut off all of my friends and listen to her negative thoughts. I was abused by her so much I believed everything she said was true. Even if it was a lie. I just don't want to suffer everyday for the truth so I can move on from my life.

What do I do now?,"For a majority of my life so far, my mom has struggled with addiction, sobriety, and relapse. My early child memories were of her breaking her addiction to cigarettes and alcohol. Thankfully, the cigarettes stopped being an issue as soon as she quit. However, 2 years ago, she started to drink again SUPER heavy.

At first, when she was starting to get symptoms from heavy alcohol consumption, she had said it was some neurological problem. She was having trouble seeing, terrible hand eye coordination, no coordination, etc. Because I wasn't aware of the drinking at the time, I had also thought it was some strange neurological issue. One day, she had fallen and couldn't get up from the floor, so we went to the emergency room. All her tests came back normal, except her blood alcohol was 4 times the legal limit and her liver was showing signs of cirrhosis. This is when it became painfully clear she had relapsed. After that, she no longer made effort to try and hide it from me. She was going through bottles of hard liquor in a matter of days.

There have been times she has been sober in the past 2 years, but only for a few months at a time, and *only* because during those times, she's been hospitalized. The alcoholism has caused her to fall numerous times, break her hip, get a hip replacement, dislocate the hip replacement 3 times until she had to get a new hip replacement, and completely obliterate any relationship she's had in the process. I am an only child, and up until recently, I've been the only other person in the house. Luckily, her boyfriend moved in like 5 months ago so it's gotten easier.

My relationship with my mother was already pretty strained before the alcohol, due to her anger issues and depression. The alcohol has made her emotionally abusive. Constantly is yelling at people, making *everything* about her (ex. she completely invalidated my grief when my ex and I broke up, and made it seem like she was the one who lost someone in their life), gaslighting, and more. She's threatened to kick me out of the house for very simple things like refusing to share my private mail with her or trying to express how her actions have greatly hurt me. I cannot talk to her... about anything. I can't talk to her about how I feel without having it turned back around at me, I can't share anything I'm excited about with her because she just judges it, I can't do anything. It's honest to God made me hate the sight of her. She REFUSES to get help or admit there's a problem.

Currently, I'm still a minor, I turn 18 in a few days. I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I want to move out and not talk to my mom ever again, but I also would feel incredible guilt for leaving her in such a detrimental state.

2020-05-01 20:38:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gbv3yf/alcoholism_has_completely_destroyed_my/,Alcoholism has completely destroyed my relationship with my mom and I don't know what to do now,"For a majority of my life so far, my mom has struggled with addiction, sobriety, and relapse. My early child memories were of her breaking her addiction to cigarettes and alcohol. Thankfully, the cigarettes stopped being an issue as soon as she quit. However, 2 years ago, she started to drink again SUPER heavy.

At first, when she was starting to get symptoms from heavy alcohol consumption, she had said it was some neurological problem. She was having trouble seeing, terrible hand eye coordination, no coordination, etc. Because I wasn't aware of the drinking at the time, I had also thought it was some strange neurological issue. One day, she had fallen and couldn't get up from the floor, so we went to the emergency room. All her tests came back normal, except her blood alcohol was 4 times the legal limit and her liver was showing signs of cirrhosis. This is when it became painfully clear she had relapsed. After that, she no longer made effort to try and hide it from me. She was going through bottles of hard liquor in a matter of days.

There have been times she has been sober in the past 2 years, but only for a few months at a time, and *only* because during those times, she's been hospitalized. The alcoholism has caused her to fall numerous times, break her hip, get a hip replacement, dislocate the hip replacement 3 times until she had to get a new hip replacement, and completely obliterate any relationship she's had in the process. I am an only child, and up until recently, I've been the only other person in the house. Luckily, her boyfriend moved in like 5 months ago so it's gotten easier.

My relationship with my mother was already pretty strained before the alcohol, due to her anger issues and depression. The alcohol has made her emotionally abusive. Constantly is yelling at people, making *everything* about her (ex. she completely invalidated my grief when my ex and I broke up, and made it seem like she was the one who lost someone in their life), gaslighting, and more. She's threatened to kick me out of the house for very simple things like refusing to share my private mail with her or trying to express how her actions have greatly hurt me. I cannot talk to her... about anything. I can't talk to her about how I feel without having it turned back around at me, I can't share anything I'm excited about with her because she just judges it, I can't do anything. It's honest to God made me hate the sight of her. She REFUSES to get help or admit there's a problem.

Currently, I'm still a minor, I turn 18 in a few days. I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I want to move out and not talk to my mom ever again, but I also would feel incredible guilt for leaving her in such a detrimental state. My therapist just tells me to try and avoid confrontation and conflict with her as much as possible, but my mom gets pissed off anyway. If I leave her alone, she gets mad, if I interact with her, she gets mad. There's no winning. Any advice for how to navigate this??",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7664768}"

Eventually, this became unsustainable. I was feeling like shit every day, I couldn't sleep well, and I was spending a lot of money drunk ordering delivery.
