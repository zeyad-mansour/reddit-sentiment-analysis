Tommorow I'm gonna call my psychiatrist, stop drinking and take benzos.

It's gonna be the 5th time I do medical rehab within 2 years. I'm 23yo.

I always ended up drinking again. It's an uphill battle.

I also have inner demons, that fuck me up over and over again. I've been through intense suffering. Even sat down for hours meditating going crazy because I couldn't continue this fight against suffering.

The last time I started drinking every day, I told myself I wouldn't be able to stop one more time. Somehow I made the decision to stop tommorow again. I'm gonna stop one more time but don't believe it's gonna work.

I'd rather stay in bed all day every day until I die. Sober, I don't know how to fight this uphill battle anymore.

Unfortunately i can't stay in bed all day.

I'm an atheist but I prayed out of despair. This obviously didn't work.


Outside of my alcohol issues I have like 5 more psychological issues and I don't see how I would ever resolve them.

I'm a burden to society and family. I have suicidal ideation for hours every day. 

Obviously not gonna do it without the consent of my family. But still I'm a basket case and I can't help myself and I am so ashamed of having to admit it.
 
I'm so fucking ashamed of suffering so much that I'm not able to become a functioning member of society I want to fucking puke. 


Tommorow I'm gonna be sober and ashamed of looking at what I wrote. I hate myself for admitting that.

I'm basically a homeless bum that's not homeless yet. ""do you guys have any spare change, fuck me..."" Poor homeless bastards.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.96414065}"

Long time first time. I’ve been a highly functioning alcoholic for probably the past 5 years. Hold a high paying job. Nice house. Great kids. My drinking started out slow enough. Never drank in college. Then became only at parties. I was very fit and loved the gym. Met the girl of my dreams and married her after 8 years of dating out of college.  Have two kids now and about to turn 40 in March. My wife and I are on the brink of divorce. She says the trust is gone and she doesn’t know if it’ll ever be back.  She said she will always love me being the father of our kids but isn’t in love. Isn’t sure if she will ever get that back as well. My problem with drinking crept so slowly it went from weekends only. To Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And the creep just kept coming until I finally was drinking 5 nights a week and all weekend.  We are both in therapy now individually trying to work on ourselves. I love it. She has her first session on Tuesday. But I went from 3 days sober to drinking again for 4. Stopped for two again. Now one on again. I’d always get caught hiding my drinking as well. Hence the trust issues. I’d hide the empties and then lie when she found them. They are old, etc. Finally gave up all my paycheck, wallet, means to get booze to my wife.  But we always find a way. I struggle each and every hour, if not minute to get my old life back from when we were so in love. When I was sober for 3 days, and then the two the depression and self hate creeps in and booze takes that away. My health sucks. But on the sober days I worked out again. Felt great. Any advice to help make it stick? Is this normal to waver so quickly? I never had a support group. Still really only have my therapist right now. I hope I haven’t ruined my marriage. When I’m sober she’s still the love of my life. Then the thoughts that she’s going to move on or already has and it’s self loathing all over again.

Hi all.
Am I am alcoholic? I know I need to stop, nothing good comes from drinking anymore.

I love to have a drink, it never always goes to far, I can have a couple drinks here and there and stop. However… when I’m drinking in a social setting… well… it never ends well. 

I started doing dry February. I took control of my health and well-being. I was eating healthy, drinking water, doing therapy, trying to manage my anxiety and my mind in general. I was doing well. I felt in a good place so had a drink this week and ended up in the bar with a couple of people I know. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone and I remember sitting at the bar and then I woke up in the middle of the night. I blacked out, have no recollection of anything and now every moment is consumed with embarrassment and “what did I do?” “What did I say?”

4 days have passed and I haven’t left my room. I’m sad, angry, embarrassed and I don’t know who I am?

I got into an argument with my partner today and I threw something at the window which nearly hit my dog. I hate myself and my head feels heavy and I feel like I’m going crazy.

Realer than what I tell my best friends. Realer than I tend to tell myself usually and if you read this, let alone provide feedback I appreciate you. Again this is lengthy.

Currently 25 and my life sucks. Sucks in the sense that I don't know where I'm going or what to do. What I want to do. 

I find myself drinking my life away.

Let's go back to the early days. Had a mother, sisters, cousins, aunt, uncles, stepdad, etc  in Tacoma, WA where I had grew till about 4 or 5 when I finally met my dad. Thought he was the shit. visited Southern IL and loved it so after long fought battles my dad got custody of me. Went from bad city life surrounded by drugs and dumb gang shit to hanging out in the woods, fishing, riding four wheelers, dirt bikes and etc. life was good. other than the fact my dad fucking would go berserk. 

Saw my dad at around age 6 hit tf out my amazing stepmother in the driveway, get in his truck, threaten to run her over since she was laid out where he left her in the drive. 
Seen him hit her, me, holes in the house constantly. it goes on

My best friend didn't have a dad but he is a straight edged guy. doesn't drink, smoke, nothing. I, on the other hand I'm daring. Only happiness I ever had in life was with my best bud who was a junior when I was a freshman in his school and my foreign gf who was a senior when I was a sophomore. 
She is from Belgium and a complete saint. God surround her every thought and action. being with her changed me for the better at the time bc I didn't come from that and I was her first everything besides sex bc that had to wait till marriage. 
anywho life went on, my best friend graduated, my ex and I lasted just over a year long distance, my cousin a year older than me hung himself due to drugs, I hated my dad, I hated my family bc of the fighting and bullshit that surrounded me. I got bad on Xanax and whatever else I could get my hands on that made me able to avoid reality. I fucked off and then later fucked up in college to where I'm not graduating right now as a result of my prior actions. went to jail a few times, went to rehab, got my shit together for a few years..I thought. as of a year or two ago my alcoholic habits got outta hand. 
but when I'm sober I really feel this way just not in such an upfront manner
I drink about 4 days a week to get absolutely shit faced. If I find pills I take them idc what they are sometimes.
But I'm not bad on pills. I don't go too far, yet I'm always fucked up on alcohol questioning my existence. Maybe dying is better than this life. I don't like people unless I'm drunk. I can't tolerate myself unless I'm drunk. 
I find myself constantly laying in bed just thinking about my gun, but I know I can't do that. I know I shouldn't and won't do that, yet sometimes it doesn't seem like a bad idea. 25, still in college fighting for my bachelor's in Geology, and hate my fucking life as I feel it's a disgrace and I'm like my dad. feel like a failure. feel like I don't want to see people
I don't want to discuss my life progress with anyone. I find myself longing for things, feelings that I can't get. deep things.

She just had a bad episode. Should I contact her workplace for help?,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel very lost and alone in this, any advice at all is appreciated.

Some background info: my mom & dad have had lifelong drug & alcohol abuse, I grew up with physical altercations and police around all the time. They've had plenty of DUI and battery convictions because of it. She's lost jobs and friends over it. After her divorce some years ago she told me she won't drink anymore, after a year she slowly started having very occasional social drinks again.

She started working at a liquor store about two years ago and always tells me about special products and deals and stuff. She's an extroverted type so I figured she was just talking about work stuff for conversation. She made a huge effort to always tell me she's not drinking all the time and ""becoming an alcoholic again"". I took it for face value because I thought I'm an adult now, I moved out, I've moved on from dealing with this stuff.


The other day my sister, who's disabled and still lives with her, called me a few times in the middle of the night asking for help because my mom was drunkenly ranting, insulting, mocking her, tripping over things, and making threats of violence or calling the police on my sister. When she's drunk, any pleas to be quiet and calm down are answered with unrelenting yelling and threats. My sister was scared and eventually called the police to check up on my mom, apparently she got into a huge fight with an officer but somehow got off okay. The cops took my sister to a hotel with no occupancy so she called me and asked to stay with me, which is an entire other issue because my wife and my sister hate each other. My sister told me some news they both were hiding from me; **she's been drinking with my mom, encouraging her to drink, and my mom's been drinking almost every day recently.**


Anyways, needless to say it's caused me and my wife a huge amount of stress. I had a panic attack after my sis left and had to call my psychologist who basically gave me the advice of blocking them out of my life because they repeatedly damage me and my relationships. I was told that the addiction coupled with my mom's bipolar and my sister's BPD essentially makes them unhelpable, which fits both their records of refusing help. They both refuse their diagnoses, their addiction, and almost any mental health help at all.

I tried calling my mom today, I just told her that what she said was hurtful and I wanna try to get past this with her, she blew up at me and said she doesn't care about my pain and will disown me if I bring it up again, hung up and blocked my number.

I know that's crazy abusive behavior, and I'm not letting her talk me into forgetting this like she usually does, I know I need to keep her and my sister out of my life for now. But the thing is neither of them have friends really and my mom just has some coworker & customer acquaintances at the liquor store. I'm worried that leaving on this note and just ignoring her for now would just make things worse for them, and I'm worried about my sister getting hurt. I feel the environment they're both in is continually reinforcing their addictions. I was thinking that letting her boss or coworkers know about this is the only way anybody else is gonna possibly talk to her about it. I don't want her fired but if that happens I think it would be for the best, she gets enough from social security and my sister's disability.


The last detail about this that further complicates things: my mom and sister are supposed to take a week long vacation to LA in like 2 days and another one to Hawaii in like 2 months. They just immediately made up and didn't talk about it for the sake of the vacation. I know for certain they're gonna get drunk and have a huge problem in LA. But they're both just mad at me now for ""trying to ruin their vacation"" by calling my mom and bringing this up. Neither of them care about the stress this put me through & my sister genuinely doesn't believe it's the alcohol to blame.


TLDR: **Would it be appropriate to call the liquor store my mom works at and let them know her alcohol abuse is getting out of control and hurting her family?** If not, maybe personally getting into contact with some of her coworker acquaintances? What's the best way to possibly help her and keep myself & my sister safe?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8049896}"

I need help on quitting,"I don't do drugs or anything else, however I moved to another country on my own (family still in the UK) and gradually over time I built up a strong alcohol dependence. I would say for the last 4 years I go sober for around 2 weeks and then drink a LOT, like 2 litres of vodka but it's just gone up since then.

I would feel better after a week or so and then go back to binging again when the cravings were too much.

I see a counsellor for it and my longest period without Alcohol has been about 60 days.

I do have Antabuse and naltrexone but haven't taken it for 2 weeks because I stupidly thought I didn't need it. Then last Friday my work asked me to train 3 new people, I said that was fine and after a few hours I could see 2 of them would need a bit more training that just one day. I was the only one in the office because the team leader couldn't be bothered to come in. He told ME to tell our manager they would need a bit more training instead of just doing his job. I come back after lunch and they are both just staring at me telling me they had just got a call from the recruiter saying they were fired.

They both pleaded with me to stay saying they just quit their last jobs to be here and asking what I can do to help them. This is not my job and I am not emotionally prepared to do this. I talked to the manager and she called the recruiter and said to tell them to leave the building right now.

&#x200B;

I wait 20 minutes and go back down and they are still waiting for me. I had to tell them what had happened and take their equipment and walk them out of the building. They were in tears I felt like doing the same.

After I finished work that day I went straight to the bottleshop and started drinking as a form of escapism and told the company I am quitting as of right now (I have another job lined up in march so had already handed in my notice)

Long story short I kept on drinking, maybe 3.. 4 liters of vodka over 3-4 days to the point I was so inebriated I don't remember anything.

Wednesday I woke up in hospital and had apparently been there since Tuesday. My Mum (So amazing and supporting) had called the my local police station as she was worried and asked them to check on me. Not that I remember any of that, all I remember is waking up in hospital covered in urine as I had wet myself.

I got discharged later that day and saw my doctor who prescribed some vallium to help with the DTs. And just been feel horrible ever since (sweating, diarrhea, nausea and fatigue) .

&#x200B;

I NEVER want to go through that again or put my parents in such bad place they have no idea if i am alive or dead.

Please... what did you do to stop that actually worked?

If you are angry or frustrated or otherwise uncomfortable psychologically or physically, this is not unusual particularly in early recovery. Discomfort is to be expected because you are going through physical and emotional change. But you do not have to make these unpleasant feelings cause you to relapse. Just go about your life anyway. In time, the discomfort will pass and you will have made it through clean and sober. Even if you have been clean for a long time, Life may challenge you and you may have to go through discomfort again while you adjust to the new challenge.

 TO DO:Don't run from bad feelings. Keep connecting to your personal Higher Power (Higher Power can be anything that restores you to sanity without hurting yourself or others) and practicing the recovery philosophy that works like eliminating resentment, being grateful, having perspective, making amends, and loving yourself and others. You can live with the discomfort because it is born from positive change. Soon you will feel FANTASTIC!",43,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.62688935}"

So I am coming up on 10 months sober this Friday but I’ve been struggling with the thought of being sober forever. AA tells us we need to and that there is absolutely no chance of ever being a moderate drinker. This is what I struggle with because I once WAS a moderate drinker. Only on the weekends a couple times a month. Then a few years ago something just clicked in my brain and I started drinking daily. I struggle with social anxiety really bad and so when I would drink I’d be social and it would be fun. I could start conversations with people that I’ve always wanted to talk to but was too shy to ever do so. I even talked to handful of celebrities via Instagram dm and it was just so exhilarating to me. (So corny I know lol). Anyway, I went to rehab 3 times for three consecutive months relapsing every time I got out. I finally got into a sober living community and that’s what really made me stop drinking. Because I couldn’t or I would be forced to leave. Don’t get me wrong I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to be here and my life has seriously changed for the better being sober. After losing three jobs in a row due to my alcoholism I finally have a great job making more than I ever have AND it’s working from home. My relationships have all gotten stronger and people are finally trusting me again. Trusting what I say to be true and not just a cover up. I have it in my head that once I find healthy coping mechanisms and get to a point where I am strong enough mentally I will be able to drink socially again. I’ve grown to almost dislike AA and feel like it’s almost cult-y. I feel really unworthy of picking up my one year chip come April because I do have these reservations.

It was going great, 1 month sober felt great. However, over the last few weeks, I've been slowly drinking a lot more. The last week it's been a few beers and a whole bottle of wine each night.

I ran out of beers yesterday so decided to have some whiskey and coke, despite me hating whiskey I still drank the whole thing.

I hate it. I hate that I've swapped substances, I hate that I can't just enjoy things in healthy moderation. I hate that I yet again have to start my sober journey. I keep engaging in cognitive dissonance to rationalise my drinking.

2022-02-22 09:27:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/syowfv/my_alcoholism_may_have_caught_up_to_me_and_im/,"My alcoholism may have caught up to me, and I'm scared.","I've been heavily drinking for over 15 years although I had my first drink around 21 years ago. My close friends and family have worried about my drinking habits although my acquaintances don't recognize me as a alcoholic, because I am well spoken, responsible, and I have most of my life together.

I've always described myself as a high functioning alcoholic. I don't worry about pissing myself in the streets, becoming homeless, or physically or emotionally abusing others. But when I drank, it was way past my limits and it was pretty much daily unless I was nursing a hangover.

It got to the point where I was drinking while working from home. I'd still complete the minimum work I needed to fly under the radar, but I could recognize that my inability to be sober for eight straight hours while at home was a problem.

As of January 6, I have had zero drops of alcohol, and I don't plan on drinking ever again. Sure, the idea of drinking enters my head, but I just don't want to anymore due to how bad it makes me feel after I've finished binging. These last one and a half months have been the longest span of sobriety I've had in two years and the second longest (first longest being 2 months and it was a time I aimed for and no longer) in probably 10 years. Exactly a week before that, I had my last cigarette.

I recently got an interview for a higher paying job. They require piss tests, but I was worried that I'd fail, because I took some delta-8 gummies (like weed edibles but a different chemical from the marijuana plant so it's less potent and actually legal). I noticed there were white tiny particles in my pee.

I googled it and the things that made most sense for me were either kidney damage, liver damage, or onset diabetes. All of these likely are caused by my drinking habits, and I honestly may have be in the early stages of all three since they may be connected, espeically when alcohol is involved.

The thing is, I asked my doctor about strong smelling urine and he said it could be a UTI, but I said it had been going on for months and I didn't feel any burning. I did have blood tests I was supposed to get, so I can't fully blame him, but I am still upset he downplayed my worries about my urine, because I noticed the change was so drastic and sudden. To this day, it has a fishy smell despite my sex life being nearly nonexistant and my hygiene being good.

A cause for this again was any of the three above with kidney failure being the most likely culprit, because there's a specific protein or chemical (I forgot which) that will make the urine smell like fish if the kidney is unable to filter it properly.

Additionally, I can gain water weight very fast (one day of bad fast food means 6 or 7 lbs of weight gain literally over night), I get swollen ankles, I have extreme fatigue (even after 8 hour nights of sleep, I am basically a zombie throughout the workday and take maybe two or three short naps on the weekends), my muscles cramp and more. A lot of these symptoms are shared with other issues I have (ADHD, sudden weight gain from depression, etc.) so I didn't know if this was alcohol related, but everything has only gotten worse, and again, the white particles in the urine are the biggest thing to tip me off.

Now that I finally have vowed to stop drinking and I am moving forward with my professional life (who knows if I even pass this urine test I have later today, but that's something to worry about on another day), I see that my alcoholism may have caught up to my health, and I'm worried the progress I've had in the past few months are all for naught.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63804287}"

I’ve always thought I had a fairly responsible relationship with alcohol, but my wife recently brought that into question, so I told here I would stop drinking. I’m probably going to give too much information, but I want to make sure I get accurate feedback, but I’ll add a TLDR at the end if you don’t want to read the rest. 

 I’m in my late 30s, I’m married, have children, have a great job that requires me to be at 100% whenever I’m work - and I’ve never felt like alcohol negatively affected any of that until my wife said something. 

I almost exclusively drink socially - and when I do it’s usually only a couple of beers, or a cocktail with my wife, or friends. If I’m at home, and we’re having a party around the pool I may have a couple more than usual - but always still want to be in full control of myself in case of an emergency. I often go weeks without drinking, and rarely drink during the week as I don’t like to feel affected by alcohol around my children, and don’t want it to affect my sleep on work nights. 

A few times a year I host a cocktail night where friends get together, make the best cocktail they can make, and we all share them while playing games. 

My wife is 100% okay with all of that.

Where my wife has an issue, is that once, or twice a month - on a weekend, I like to play some video games online with my friends, and have some drinks. I never start drinking until my wife, and children go to bed, and I always communicate with her that I’m going to stay up late, have a few drinks, and play some games with my friends - likely watch a movie once everyone is off. To me, this is the only time that I really get to fully unwind, and have some “guy time”. I’ll often do it without drinking, but like I said - once or twice a month I’ll just let loose a little. I’ll usually play games, watch movies, and have a few drinks over 4-6 hours, and it usually ends with my falling asleep on the couch (regardless if I’m drinking or not). I try my best to stay up, because I know my wife likes me to come to bed every night - but usually I’m just exhausted from the week and knock out. For the record, I can fall asleep anywhere, anytime - regardless of drinking or not. 

The other night I was playing with my friends, made a couple of rum an cokes, and ended up falling asleep before even starting to drink the second one. I woke up to my wife dumping all of our alcohol down the sink. We had a pretty decently stocked bar, as we like to entertain, and she dumped all of it - including some bottles that were a couple of years old and hadn’t even been opened. When I saw what she was doing, I simply told her that I’m sure she had a good reason, and we could talk in the morning. 

The next morning I asked if we could talk, I told her that if she felt that alcohol was an issue, I’d gladly stop drinking. I told her that I would never want alcohol to get in the middle of our relationship, and she doesn’t need to justify her decision. She was really appreciative of it, but says she still wants to drink socially - but doesn’t want me having my late night drinking/gaming nights anymore. 

While I truly have no issue not drinking if that’s what she wants, I’m curious what others think. Could this mean I really do have a drinking problem? If so, why wouldn’t she want me to stop completely?

Thanks for your input.

One of things that was an impediment to me recognizing my addiction was how normalized drinking is in our society. When I would tell my friends I thought I had a problem with drinking, they would become defensive and try to downplay any problems I was telling them about. Looking back, I think they knew that if I admitted that I had a problem, maybe that meant they then had a problem too.

What I have come to realize being on the other side of alcohol addiction is it really is a spectrum. Your addiction to alcohol doesn't have to be the absolute worst case scenario for it still to be an addiction. Maybe you are a functional alcoholic who can still have relationships and hold down a job, but how much of your own potential are you leaving on the table by drinking? How much time are you wasting by being hungover for half or all of the day and being drunk 3-5 nights out of the week? Shouldn't that be a compelling enough reason to quit? 

Alcohol use doesn't have to be abnormal to be a problem. The problem is, we live in a sick society that normalizes unhealthy dependencies on basically anything that can be monetized, alcohol included. 

So, good luck out there to anyone who knows they have a problem with alcohol and wants to quit, or simply wants more out of their lives and knows alcohol is holding them back. In either case, don't let the sick lens of society cloud your ability to judge what you actually need to do to heal yourself and realize your full potential.",52,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6400378}"

For the last two years or so he’s graduated from drinking 40’s to a fifth of vodka (at least one) daily. He wakes up before everyone else in the house to hit the store and is usually drunk by 10 AM. He always comes home with a Sprite, and his cheap plastic vodka bottle hidden in his sock. I find Fleishmann’s vodka bottles all over the house. Under piles of dirty laundry, underneath the removeable part of our bathroom trash cans, under the bathroom sinks.. there are hundreds of these bottles behind our home where there is nothing but desert. He usually denies that he has a problem, but other times will admit he feels that he does. He uses it to cope, to celebrate, to numb himself. He recently got suspended from his job because they found alcohol in his locker. What did he do after finding out? Got a fifth of vodka and was drunk by 9 AM. It was the weekend of our youngest daughter’s bday, and he was snoring and drooling away on the couch while we sang happy birthday to her and her cousin who shared the same birthday. I can’t tell you how much pain I feel when I get the kids ready for bed and they jump on top of him and hug him, tell him “goodnight daddy I love you!” getting no response because he’s passed out on the couch after a binger.

I begged him to not drink it as I warned him alcohol is not welcome in our home around our children anymore. I asked him to give it to me and he wouldn’t. He said he would leave because wasn’t going to stop drinking. That was this morning.

Now I’m here scrambling to figure out how I am going to continue on while also reaping the consequences of something I didn’t do. And the other half of me is devastated and worried sick that he will never get better. That alcohol will kill him.

And I find myself sitting here feeling like the biggest piece of shit for making him leave.

For about the past 3 years I've been drinking every day, to be honest my brain doesn't even work well enough anymore to figure out exactly when I started. My family has a history of alcohol abuse, a few of my relatives on my dad's side of the family struggled with alcohol. I started experimenting with vodka & rum at about 16y/o as a way to ease my stress & social anxiety at night. That has turned into the past two summers being especially bad, wasting what I think is easily 8 thousand dollars I saved up. Probably closer to 12k to be honest, which makes me absolutely sick to think about. I'd sneak out my window and roll our family car out of the driveway to get more beer at 1am and in general just acted like an ass.

I've stolen from my parents, I am often unemployed, dropped out of university, driven drunk many many many times, and disappointed just about everyone who cares about me. I've made so many poor decisions and I've become a complete loser. I used to be smart and have a soul, I look back at all the embarrassing things I've done and all the time wasted and I just want to cry. And cry. I am so ashamed of my irresponsible and reckless actions, and thinking back to all the times I was seconds away from probably getting a DWI makes me physically sick.

The hardest part is I can never tell my parents, I can't stand to disappoint them anymore; they would be absolutely crushed knowing that I've been living in their home and drinking in secret. I feel so alone and helpless, my mind has been set on never telling them and quitting on my own for some time now but that's not working. None of my friends talk to me anymore except a few, for good reason, I've probably annoyed the hell out of them with my drunk texts & calls. Makes me want to start a completely new life in another state, I feel embarrassed to stick around in my city.

My last drink was at 4am today before I slept for a few hours. I'm somehow past the worst of physical withdrawals despite being drunk all day the last 2 weeks, of which I remember very little and my room is trashed. I'm not looking forward to these next few nights of sweating & nightmares, but it will be nice to wake up sober. I might go to AA tonight but my social anxiety has kept me from sharing when I've gone in the past. Any advice is welcome",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9349148}"

I've been a regular user of spirits since I was a teenager. I've never really had a problem with stopping for a while, and have always been on top of drinking too often etc.

This month I think I've been hitting it a little too hard. Drinking 2 bottles of vodka in about 3 days. I woke up a couple days ago and felt really low. I kept an eye on my mood all day until I had a drink, and I think I felt better when I did, so I woke up next morning and poured the entire bottle away.

It's been 2 days and I feel super low, and a little bit dizzy/disoriented at times. Am I experiencing withdrawal?

Background: I threw a big Halloween party. Jack was on the basketball team, and so many people at the school would be talking about the party, I knew I had to invite my whole team. Jack is a grade younger than me, but old for his age, so he had trouble making friends in his grade. He was also a bully and a weirdo growing up, however that changed when he got to high school. I’m straight, but He’s a pretty attractive dude and he’s tall and an athlete and stuff so all the girls who never knew who he was flicked to him at my party. He was very drunk, but nothing terrible. Just a normal teen who got really hammered. At the time, there were rumors that jack was touching girls inappropriately but nothing arised from that. At my party he met a pretty and sweet girl - in fact it was the girl I’ve had a crush on my whole childhood to this day. Forgot to mention that one of the sexual assault rumors was about Emma (said that she was assaulted by jack) but they started dating so it wasn’t believable and they were both drunk. Idk about Emma but jack didn’t remember much about that night. That next week, jack gets too scared to talk to emma (possibly indicating social issues) and their interaction was very awkward in front of the whole team. Apparently they started talking and snap chatting, and eventually they started dating despite this weird encounter. This was a surprise to all of us because Emma was the most popular girl in school, and Jack was a random guy a grade lower, who was labeled as weird. 

Recent events: The next red flag was on a randoms sunday. We had a elimination playoff game the next day, but jack was sending Snapchat videos to our groupchat and he was clearly wasted. Keep in mind it was a school night too. And he was only with his brother, that’s it. After he sent us those videos, we were all talking in the group chat and he proceeded to unnecessarily use racial racial slurs which made us all feel uncomfortable although the slurs didn’t affect us. he also decided to hit up seven girls that night. He has a girlfriend who is very pretty, nice, and popular yet he still did this. I still have no clue if she even knows about this. We told him to stop but he had no remorse and acted like nothing happened the next day. A couple weeks of practice, and playoff games goes by and our season is over. However, one of our teammates happens to be throwing a party on a Saturday (yesterday). When I get to the party, I see Jack absolutely hammered. I don’t know if this is insulting or not, but he was acting like he was mentally disabled / special needs. I’ve literally never seen someone get that drunk, and he wouldn’t even pull trig. He was completely out of it, not speaking English, and just very weird. It was very embarrassing for Emma at first, but she just thought he was very drunk. Then peoples start talking at the party, and rumors going around that he is touching girls again. At this point it kind of makes sense because of how drunk he is. So me and some of my teammates are trying to get him to throw up so that he will calm down, yet he won’t do that. We leave through the garage door so he can throw up outside, yet he just wouldn’t listen to us. He’s very very strong, so we were trying to hold him down while he threw up and he just pushed us off of him and sprinted for the door of the house. Once he was at the door, it was locked so he knocked and a girl opened it. I kid you not, like a lifeless human with no control, as soon as this girl open the door he grabbed her coochie. Like I had a perfect angle and saw it with my own eyes. I was so shocked I didn’t know what to do and I felt so much guilt for not protecting her but I had no clue that would happen. He proceeded to do stuff like this the whole night, and eventually someone got him in their car and took him home. Emma was devastated because word spread, and for other personal reasons about their relationship. 

Is there a mental disorder that describes Jack? Maybe something to do with alcohol? His whole family is kind of weird. His dad especially. He’s also normally a really smart and hard-working kid, he has all A’s and takes hard classes and stuff. But he just gets so hammered, starts touching women, stop speaking English, and no disrespect but he starts acting like he has special needs. I assume Emma and Jack are going to break up now, so I won’t be seeing much of him around since the season is over and he won’t be at our parties anymore. But I’m worried because I’ve never seen anything like this before. Please let me know what you guys think is wrong with him because we are probably going to get in contact with his parents.

My cardiologist told me I need to significantly cut back or stop drinking. I went from drinking 3-4 nights a week to 1. Felt really good about myself and even though it was  1 Night I’d have 5-6 drinks, I was drinking nowhere near how much I was. Fast forward 4 months and I had another AFIB event the day after I drank. Basically realized that in reality, I can never drink more than 1 drink in a sitting and can only do so most likely a handful of times throughout the year. I’m extremely bummed out and was really content with my 1 day a week.

I've been around recovery 20+ years.  I continued to have anger issues and social struggles even after years of sobriety.   I got my diagnosis of ASD a few years ago and doing some self study (and medication) really has helped.

The problems with social skills and being part of a tribe has really hurt me,  particularly in the workplace.  The failures I've had in the past have deeply affected how I feel about myself and my willingness to put myself out there for others.   These feelings in turn trigger horrible urges.

I did discuss with my psychiatrist and he was ok with it but within a few weeks I crashed and burned.   The worst happened at a job I'd had for a year and luckily it was seen as an aberration.  Having that come back has affected my mood for days and I feel like such a flop and failure for having this issue.

Friday was such a tough day,  I started the day feeling down.  I had another medication my insurance refused to fill unless we got them old labs.

WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU OFFERING YOUR HELP IF YOU CANT EVEN HUG ANOTHER PERSON IN NEED!?

I didnt ask for too much, did I? I didn't ask for money, shelter, food? Just a hug.

My lover is telling me he can't fuck me cos I'm too much in alcohol. And HE is an alcoholic. At least what he says.

No wonder I'm like this, my dad was drinking heavily all his life and I'm his daughter.

People, stop drinking. We, alcoholics, stink. Not even other alcoholics want to deal with us. Not even other moms want to hug other single moms when we are on alcohol.

But, how does one get a hug then?

I was cuddling his (my lover's) dog whole night. Who's gonna hug me? I need it so much. People under appreciate this.

I passed fifth exam (online) for my ""best friend"" and she asked me what I want in return. I told her (texting) I want a hug. She forgot about it.

Why is it so hard for people to get this?

Why is it so hard for people to hug each other? Why is it so hard to share/give human to human basic appreciation/love?

Aren't we social animals? Don't we all need this?

Can someone be with me, here, please? In my loneliness?

That's nothing new but my brother has really been slipping into it lately especially dealing with life stress. He's the oldest and doesn't have as much ""under his belt"" as his two younger sisters. We both moved out and moved on and built lives for ourselves. Not saying it was easy or perfect but that's something he just never cared to do. He would rather stay in his hometown and drink his life away. Ny cousin gave him a room nearby the city we moved to. He finally grew up. Was working full time, paid off all his debts, stopped getting drunk every single day. Then he meets a girl and they end up moving in together. His ex comes at him for child support after 6 years of zero contact. He jumps around job to job for a bit finally settling at a delivery company. Gets in a fight with his girlfriend since she stopped taking her pills and went off the edge and took off. Boom DUI. Now he's dealing with that stress, lost his job, can't pay child support, car needs to be fixed and every time he goes out with his friends he gets smashed and talks about killing himself. I tried to get him to get counseling but he refused so I had him talk to a doctor about getting anti depressants. They worked for both my mother and myself so I was really hoping they would help. I don't think he's gotten worse but I just don't know what to do anymore. His friends keep calling me and telling me the things he is saying and I can't babysit him all the time. What do I do?

When we try to rationalize with her she says «im happy»,  «i dont need to stop», «its not a problem»(yet she stated it was a problem in the phone call, begging for help and saying she cant stop).

Drinking until drunk every night for the past 6 years. I initially started drinking because of chronic insomnia that no sleeping pills helped with. Whereas alcohol would knock me out. My usual drinking routine was an 8% tall boy/6% tall boy and a 16 ounce 5.5% a few hours before I went to sleep. I never drank during the day. This Christmas my family bought me a bunch of alcohol and I went on a binge for about 2 months drinking a lot more than my baseline. I tried to cut back but failed every time. I have very little impulse control. I was waking up with anxiety so bad I had to just stand in front of a mirror and talk to myself to not have a panic attack. I felt like I was dying until I drank. I decided enough was enough. Watched loads of videos on how to stop drinking and visited this sub and the Stopdrinking one. 

There was no way I could cold turkey and I don't have the funds to get a medical detox so tapering was my only option. The past 2 weeks I've drank only enough to stave off the withdrawl. I got down to one light 4% tallboy sipped over the course of a few hours. I'm now about 75 hours without my last drink. I had some anxiety and heart palpitations but my withdrawl was pretty mild compared to how it was before I tapered.  Around hour 72 without alcohol I started having the worst anxiety I've ever felt. I'm 3 hours past that and it is still really bad. I also have a really bad headache and can't stop fidgeting. My back is killing and I have had a lot of pains in my chest which I saw was common in withdrawl. Every video/article I read said that the worst of the withdrawl if you don't have Dts is within 72 hours and it gets better the longer you go abstaining from alcohol. But I am feeling much worse than before. 

I don't know if it's the anxiety but I feel like something is very wrong. I don't have access to a car but I could maybe have a family member take me to the doctor. I read that you should not try to stop using alcohol if you're a long-time user without benzos. I am wondering if that ship has sailed. They will see I'm 75 hours without a drink and just send me home. I've had to get up multiple times writing this to try and calm myself down but I just feel really awful. Is this normal? I don't know what level of withdrawl I'm in but my anxiety is making me fear the worst. I really feel like I need the benzos to calm my body down.

I have a few people in my life whose fathers are alcoholics too but in a way I can't relate to them, because even though we lived in a similar situation, we didn't, because my father isn't aggressive when he drinks.... he is just pathetic. His words are slurred, he is dumb and annoying, he is an embarrassment. And this is my first time admitting this because a few days ago I was trying to pick up his weak body from the floor while he was crying and telling me that he is having a tough time and my only response was to yell and cry too.   
Every time I read about alcoholic fathers it's always about how abusive they are mentally and psychically, but my father hasn't done anything to me, sober or drunk.  He has yelled at me once, ONCE and that's all. And everyone keeps telling me,- ""Well at least he isn't aggressive.."", even I keep saying that to myself, but here is the thing, my dad is still an alcoholic even without the beating and the yelling and all of that sh\*t.   
And after 10 years of me seeing him be this way, the thing that happened a few days ago was the thing that made me finally snap. I loved my dad, my father was my hero, he was exactly like me, in looks and personality and I loved that fact as a kid. But now the fact that I resemble him makes me so angry and scared for my future. But the pathetic man I was dragging a few days ago, was actually the real him.

I thought it was normal to cry every time I see good father figures on TV.

To give context, I’m a hypochondriac (fear pertaining to health). I drink more than I should, and I went down a rabbit hole of reading these articles about vitamin deficiency, delirium tremens, scary stuff. I’ve been freaking out. And I have been heavy drinking for about 6 months. 

I know these can all happen, but with every website I saw that was truly fear mongering (talking about brain damage, comas, etc) it didn’t give full context in a medical way and let my imagination wonder. And there was this big “Call Now!” Button floating at the bottom calling my name. 

As humans, we have to think of other humans incentives. The website/business’s job is to make money. They make money by admitting people into detox/rehab. Freaking people out a little gets people to call. 

Im no doctor. Some people truly need medical help. But as a hypochondriac flipping out and realizing how things work, if you are experiencing extreme symptoms you should be okay.

I just turned 21 about half a year ago, and before I turned 21 I was always afraid of becoming addicted to alcohol because of the easy access.

I drank a lot and it was pretty bad, but when I went home for winter break (I’m in college still) I stopped cold turkey for about a month. Everything was fine, I didn’t even feel an urge to drink and I just thought “maybe everything is alright”. My bf ended up getting arrested early December for DV which was really rough. I started drinking again around January and since then have gotten drunk pretty much every day I was able to.

I’ve always kind of been a perfectionist so I tend to get all my work/homework done as soon as it’s assigned and then just use that as a reason to get shitfaced in the middle of the week. I’ve been in therapy for almost a year. I started EMDR with a new therapist a few months ago but I’ve honestly been too scared and embarrassed to even mention any of this to her. I feel like a complete fuckup but at the same time I don’t want to admit what I’ve been doing and want to keep doing it cause it’s the only thing that makes me feel okay.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74505264}"

I am concerned about my husband’s drinking habits. A bit of background: we’ve been together for nine years and married for about two. When we first started dating, we did a fair amount of binge drinking together as a lot of 20 something’s do, as did a lot of our friends and peers, but by age 30 or so, I had essentially grown out of it. A big part of this was me resuming treatment for ADHD after years of pretending I didn’t need it. (As a note, I have never abused my meds bc they’ve allowed me to have the life I want; husband has no issues whatsoever with me taking them and doesn’t view it as “drug use,” so I’m doubtful this would play into the situation). Anyhow, I’ll have one or two drinks maybe once a month at most. It just doesn’t make me feel well after a few. I’m also extremely health conscious, though I always have been, so it’s not new to him. I’m not sure if this is relevant or not, but we were both drinking somewhat regularly by jr/sr year in high school.

Since we’ve been together, he always drank, sometimes to excess, in situations where the cost/benefit didn’t make sense to me, such as staying home to watch basketball or having a few drinks during a lunch out. I guess to me, drinking was pretty much exclusively for having fun with friends. When the pandemic hit, he started drinking more, which I assumed would pass. About a year ago, I went back to working at the office while he continued to WFH. I think things got much worse at this point. If I had to estimate how much he’s been drinking since, I’d say 1-2 nights per week of notable binge drinking, and maybe another two nights of lighter drinking (2-3 drinks). I do suspect there may be more drinks consumed outside of my awareness. He knows I’ve been growing increasingly uncomfortable with the situation and could be hiding some of his consumption; I have definitely “caught” him low key carrying drinks out of the kitchen and up to his office (evenings, not daytimes). I also knows that if he meets a client or friend for lunch, he’ll say he had two or three drinks. 

A few other potentially important points: he has driven impaired many times and always promises he won’t do it again. Afaik, he hasn’t recently, but that may be due to less activity in general during pandemic and moving very close to the subway. He has blacked out numerous times in the past year (ex: went to a show, never came home or contacted me to let me know, and eventually called to say he passed out on one of my friend’s couches). He just came home from a bachelor party, puked on the plane home, and spent the night on the couch whining about his nausea and heartburn. He also neglected to make sure the cats had fresh water and enough food at their scheduled mealtime.

As his drinking has increased,he has been very depressed, irritable, and unmotivated. Sometimes he lays in bed for hours or nestles on the couch, complaining about being depressed and unmotivated. He isn’t taking care of himself- gaining body fat, especially around his midsection, not exercising regularly, eating takeout often bc he won’t prepare food on a regular basis, and his hair, which always had a little gray, seemingly went nearly full gray over months. I’ve observed him visibly trembling, which I suspect may be mild withdrawal. Occasionally, I smell an acetone-esque/almost grandma-perfume type smell coming from him. 

After writing this post, I’m sure I have reason to be concerned, but if anyone can share how they handled a similar situation, what the outcome was, what helped/what didn’t, I’d be so grateful. Is this what alcoholism looks like? I’m constantly stressing over this.

I have always enjoyed drinking and would get drunk 1 or 2 nights a week when going out for the night with friends. This new problem all stems from a breakdown of my friendship group last year, and now my social anxiety stops me making new friends. I am socially isolated and this has made me depressed. I rarely leave my room and hang out with people - and when I do, I feel like I need to be drunk.

It’s so easy to get alcohol when you live alone that I just buy 1L bottles. Because I’m socially isolated, bored and depressed most of the time, and have basically no friends to go out with, for the past month I have been getting drunk alone basically every night. Like it is really bad - I will sit in bed and drink shot after shot alone, and sometimes go through half a bottle in one night. I did an alcohol questionnaire and worked out I’ve been drinking about 100 units/week. I don’t drink during the day so it’s not affecting my uni work in that respect, apart from the fact I am usually hungover, feel like shit and this stops me from being productive during the day.

After embarrassing myself on a night out last week and having to be pulled out the club toilets by the bouncer (I have no memory of this), I have recognised this is bad and I’m trying to stop. I also started noticing increased tolerance in the past few weeks. I’ve been 3 days sober so far because I was worried I was becoming an alcoholic. So far I’ve got no withdrawal symptoms and I actually feel slightly better mentally and physically - but I can’t stop thinking that I want to drink. I don’t even think it is physical craving I am just bored and feel like life is so much more fun being drunk. I just feel like I’d be having so much more fun right now if I was drunk.

And I’m not sure if I have a problem with alcohol or a problem with life. Anyways, I think I’m gonna keep at the sober thing for a while and then I’ll see if drinking in moderation works again.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.540551}"

That was October 2020. February 2021 he was diagnosed with epilepsy after suffering 2 grand mal seizures. He was put on a drug, keppra, that has stopped the seizures but we do believe it has altered his (our) life for the worse. Right after this diagnosis we found out we were having our baby. Around summertime 2021 I started having suspicions he was drinking again here and there. It’s always the same. He would leave to run an errand and when he came back, his behavior would be totally different, his smell, etc. He always denied it. This started to become more frequent and come Fall/Winter, it really became a big issue for us. Him gaslighting me. Rage issues. Finally after a night of him behaving as if he was blackout drunk, (but still convincing me I was crazy and wrong) the next day when I confronted him in a for sure sober state, he finally admitted that he had been drinking at times to cope and he didn’t want to tell me, because then he knew he would have to stop, and he felt that was the best thing for him at the time. This was just a few weeks ago. For probably about 1.5 weeks, I didn’t have any instances where I was questioning again. But it started back up. He leaves to run an errand and comes back acting completely different. Talking all over the place. Smelling strongly. (He uses mint flavored toothpicks and always comes back with a red bull. I believe that these items are covers.) Getting angry at times,being mean. These behaviors are really not like him.
I am very worried. Our relationship is kind of deteriorating and it makes me feel very lost and confused. He is also on multiple psych meds in addition to the seizure med—none of which he should be drinking on. 
Because of all of his previous gaslighting I really don’t know what to think or believe anymore. Am I crazy? Am I being unfair? Do I just ignore it? How can it even be dealt with or addressed if he is in fact doing so, if he isn’t willing to admit it?

Disulfiram has been a HUGE help for me. Motivation is hard. I have stopped taking ""forgetting"" pills and then waiting two weeks to drink again. But it has helped me a lot. Crucial is also to stop drinking caffeine for me.

And artificial sugar is causing an interaction with disulfiram resulting in headaches. Artificial sugar is a ""sugar-alcohol"". 

Disulfiram also slows down the breakdown of caffeine, one cup of coffee now becomes two cups! Thus causing an increase in anxiety and an increase in the need to drink to bring the anxiety down. Caffeine is addictive too mind you! 

And eat healthily. Fresh raw foods. Uncooked. Bananas, carrots, raw saurkraut, everything raw and fresh. No sugar. No vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is all empty calories and an inflammatory.

He's a heavy alcohol user and was recently thrown out of his home by his wife, and threatened to commit suicide not too long ago. Since then my parents took him back in, but we're having a hard time getting him to brush his teeth, shower, change clothes etc. For example, he hasn't showered in about a week and he's wet himself twice within the past two days. We have tried telling him nicely, and even tried to bribe him to bathe, but he's recently taken to lying about having showered. The main reason we know he's lying is because the bathroom is in the middle of the house and we can hear when the shower is running. He smells really, really bad like if he was on skid row not at home with family attempting to help him, and we keep trying to clean up after him, but the smell is starting to ""stick"" to us. 

Do any of you have any suggestions on how we can help him at least get out of that level of funk without making him feel worse about himself?

This begins the process of isolation when one learns to depend on themselves instead of finding safe people to be open with. As time goes on, further trauma(s) may continue to solidify these findings and thus, isolation continues.

She went on to outline that the social aspects of A.A. instills safety back into people and that's the opposite of isolation: fellowship. Being open, honest, and vulnerable people reverses the effects of isolation. Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.

I've always been a big binge-drinker and used to be unable to ""stop once I started"" and loved partying, especially when I was depressed.I went to college and had some health problems and removing myself from my drunken hometown environment and feeling physically terrible made me sober up for a year or two. Then my job sucked and my relationship imploded and I started hanging out with my childhood friend/drinking buddy/soulmate again. We've been friends since middle school and drinking buddies since 16. We have a lot in common and would arguably be great together. But he is a serious alcoholic who has only gotten worse with time. He used to always drink heavily, but remained fun, charming and alert. Now, he doesn't eat, blacks out, pisses his pants, falls down, slurs incoherently and acts like an ass to me.This has been a long one. We really love each other and have a fantastic friendship where we play music together and he's one of the only people I feel close to. I've been unable to remove him from my life, we're both depressed and even though I drink more reasonably these days, I still have THC daily. After a serious talk about him getting help, he got wasted af like 6 times in one day and was falling down, saying he was sorry and done drinking all 6 times. We met up on Friday and I told him I was upset because we can't have a functional relationship because of his drinking. He threw some hurtful shit from the past in my face again and I realized that he is normally kind to me, until I question his alcoholism and drinking. Then he attacks me where it hurts. He's fun to be around and sexy until he gets wasted. He doesn't show up for me or support me. If I'm not around/willing to party, he will find another girl who will. I've been very hurt by him, but still love him and want to help him. We're not talking at the moment after a failed attempt at Valentine's day.What kind of healthy boundaries should I start setting up, or should I let him go? He insists that he's truly in love with me and I know I love him, but I have so much hurt now and I know it would only work if he was sober. But I don't know if he has it in him. I know he loves alcohol more than me. Even if it couldn't work out romantically, I love him as a person and as a friend. But also don't know if I could tolerate being his friend if he remains this way. From an alcoholics perspective, what can I do, what should I do? What do you wish your partner's had done to help you? What can I say? Should I quit talking to him after a lifetime together? Am I a fucking idiot?",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3906089}"

2022-02-14 09:04:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ssbeey/ramifications_of_recent_relapse/,Ramifications of recent relapse,"I'm going to spare the backstory. It's not irrelevant, just trying to keep this brief. I (M31) have been in a relationship for 6 years. I coincidentally lost control of my drinking 6 years ago. I tried my best to manage it, which of course I couldn't do. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, and scared she would leave. I eventually got 'caught', since you can only explain away so much. After I got 'caught' my girlfriend and parents pretty much let everyone else know - my friends, her parents, and so forth. That made me extremely uncomfortable, but I swallowed my pride and did what I knew I needed to do, since they were just trying to help me - I quit drinking.

I made it nearly 2 years, but continued smoking pot and not really working a program. I am not sure that AA is for me. I do credit smoking weed with helping me get to the 1 year mark, but as I approached the 2 year mark, I genuinely decided I wanted to just be sober. I quit smoking, but was stunned at the difficulty of the withdrawal process. After multiple nights of not sleeping, extreme irritability & anxiety, I drank. It was an ugly relapse, and oddly enough, it seemed like it happened in the name of sobriety. 

Anyway, here I am. I feel pretty uncomfortable because it feels like everyone on the outside is looking for me to start working a program, since that's what I was not doing last time, even though I had a good streak. I made it nearly TWO YEARS without a drink, and no one was pressuring me to do anything differently, despite the fact that I was stoned every single day. So I quit smoking, relapse on alcohol, and it feels like my parents, my girlfriend, and even her parents, are waiting to see if I will start working a program, basically citing my lack of AA as reason for the relapse in the first place. I now have 32 days since my relapse, no weed, no alcohol, not even coffee. Yet, my girlfriend's mom literally asked me if I am now in recovery. My girlfriend is continually asking me if I'm going to go to meetings. I'm supposed to meet with her parents and let them in on my situation, which I understand, but it really weighs on me. They are wanting the best for their daughter. But I'm just really uncomfortable with everyone feeling like they know what's best for me. I made it two years without a drink and I am proud of that. I slipped, as people like us do. I picked myself back up, now better than ever. I haven't been this sober in nearly 15 years. And I'm loving it. I realize there is a pink cloud potential, and all that. But I suppose this is why I'm writing. My girlfriend is saying that she doesn't want to 'just wait around' for the next relapse. And I don't know what to say to that. I genuinely don't feel that attending meetings will *necessarily* prevent another relapse. I try to be blunt with her, and understanding at the same time. She truly has been so supportive and is trying her best, despite not having any experience with this. I know it's not fair for me to make promises like ""I'll never drink again"" just to make her feel better. I've told her that if it's too much for her, then maybe it is just that - too much for her. I can be harsh in that way, self-sabotage is my middle name. It's just easier to leave than to be left behind, you know? I care for her deeply and I actually had plans to propose this year. As I said, I'm 31, been together for 6 years. I was 2 years without a drink, everything was going alright. Then I relapse, and it feels like everything is back to square 1, even though I don't really feel that way. Do I give her what she needs and give her a break, knowing that she isn't equipped to deal with this on her own, but is trying? Or do I honor my own inclinations and feelings about what I need, and see how the dust settles? I'm torn between understanding that relationships are about compromises, but also knowing that the truer you can be to yourself, the more likely you'll succeed in the long run. I underpromise and overdeliver. That's who I am, and what feels fair to myself. But she keeps wanting to see more action from me, in the hopes that will help her feel more assured that a relapse won't happen again. I want to help her, but I don't think jumping into AA full swing is the answer for me. Again, I made it almost 2 years without a drink, suffered a short relapse, and now I'm back, off of everything. It feels great, but I'm still paying for my actions. Anyone felt like this? Any guidance? Looking for some outside interpretation. Many thanks.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58856624}"

I've tried hypnotherapy, which didn't work and just cost me hundreds. 
I've been drinking multiple times a week to cope or do ""normal things"" like go to the supermarket or appointments.

It's the anxiety. If I could just get rid of this constant debilitating, consuming anxiety then I wouldn't need to drink to feel safe. Because its the only time I feel safe.

So over a month ago I have started drinking on nearly everyday basis, it started at the end of December. I've never struggled with it or any other substances before, the only addiction I've had was nicotine addiction, which isn't particularly life-wrecking. I wasn't expecting myself to get hooked on alcohol so quickly, I've always hated the taste of it and could have never guessed that it would become one of my favorite things in the world. 

When I first started drinking I almost always felt good and relaxed while drunk, but now it just makes me even more miserable when I'm under its influence. Alcohol doesn't cut it for me anymore, yet I can't imagine quitting my newfound little ""hobby"". At this point I'm just drinking it out of habit and ""necessity"".

Whenever I drink I take it to the extreme and black out, even though I never mean to or want to black out. I find black outs genuinely haunting, the fact that my body just walks around and keeps talking while I'm not even really there because I quite literally consciousness. I have done many embarrassing things while black-out, at one point I even woke up with multiple injuries and bruises after drinking and could not remember how, when or where I got any of them. My lower back hurt so bad I could barely walk or sit.

One of the most shameful alcohol-related things I've done while fully sober is stealing my grandmother's money just to buy alcohol. I drank my way through January, don't think I've had a single sober day during it. This month I only drank roughly 4 times, I don't know, I lost my count. When I'm sober I can't stop thinking about how excited I am to get drunk again one day. Let me mention again that it doesn't even improve my mood, just makes me lash out on others more than I normally do. I can barely recognize myself.

i need to rant so ye, ever since i was young my mom has had a toxic relationship with liquor on a inconsistent basis. It always brings out the absolute worse in her & i’ve never seen her actually happy while drinking. She definitely abuses it to cope & deal with past issues she’s had, but it’s the worst feeling in the world when all the blame from her is placed on you & what you are currently doing. Ever since i was young i’ve had numerous traumatic incidents just from her abusing alcohol which has definitely led to me shaping into how i am now. i know she doesn’t abuse it solely because of me, but i have lots of issues myself at the moment which gives her fuel to add to the fire. I’m currently dealing with issues in regards to anxiety which is refraining me from working, i quit my job after nearly 3 months of working due to me having a panic attack mid shift at work, and due to just lingering issues with anxiety which haven’t been dealt with. I’m on medication for it, and have been since may of 2021, it helps me somewhat but i still struggle with it in high pressure situations. the main issue I haven’t dealt with yet is talking to a therapist which i plan to do starting march. I’ve waited such a long time due to covid restrictions still being present where i live. My mom knows all the anxiety stuff i deal with as i first talked to her about it, yet she still throws it in my face whenever she’s drunk. It’s a shitty feeling. Ontop of having to worry about her well being i also have to worry about my 2 younger siblings. when they are in her sole possession while under the influence, she always gets to the point of getting shitfaced & absolutely obliterated to the point she isn’t able to function on her own.. and she purposely does so. She acknowledges she has a problem drinking, yet never takes the proper steps in order to do anything about it… i myself at 21 am able to acknowledge i need help & am making an effort to do so, she herself acts as if everybody is crazy & always gets defensive if anybody criticizes her. If you do she tears you into shreds making you feel like an absolute useless piece of shit.. to make herself feel better. Currently she’s in the midst of drinking & was on the phone minutes ago blaming ME for the stress going on in her life. She’s on medication just like me & has decided drinking is more important then taking her medication resulting in her not taking her medication in over a week & having a mental breakdown essentially. Am i crazy or am i not in the wrong here? I grew up 8 years old with my mom being dragged to my doorstep by a STRANGER in the middle of the night who walked her home from the outside of a bar because she left us sleeping in the middle of the night to go drink. In that very moment if that person was not kind she could have been killed, robbed, drugged, r*ped etc. i’ve grown up seeing my mom dripping blood from her face from falling due to being shitfaced, i’ve grown up seeing her smash all the teeth out of her mouth due to being shitfaced, i’ve grown up seeing my mom unconscious passed out on the floor when i get home from school yet i’m the worst human being ever.. right. 

childhood: 
my childhood was fucked up as well, but for the most part good. I have great supporting family on my mom’s side which has led to it being not so shitty. my mom’s side of the family is very well put together & sorted besides my mom, my mom dropped out of highschool & never finished & both my aunts both went to post secondary & finished school completely. They are very supportive & nice but they definitely have a old school mentality of just getting stuff done no matter how hard stuff may be personally. I’m not built like that, I guess I’m just a sensitive drama queen. My mom always compares me to my cousins as if they are the blueprint for what i should be doing but all my cousins grew up in a dual income & parent home with the stereotypical normal life.. i didn’t. I don’t like being compared to them when we had two totally different upbringings, it’s infuriating. They had resources growing up to shape them for the future successfully, supportive parents, little to no trauma, recreational activities, extravagant gifts & holidays etc. on holidays and birthdays i got not much at all which I’m grateful for of course, would it have been nice growing up getting things that I actually wanted and didn’t expect? Yes of course, am i complaining? No. My point is that we are polar opposites and being held to a unrealistic standard sets me off. I lost my dad when i was 13 years old so the father figure in my life has practically been non existent. It’s definitely shaped my childhood to be somewhat different, since i was only around my mom & knew hardly anything about him personally besides what i’ve been told. I saw him a few times from my recollection, but the narrative i got of him was nothing but negative all thanks to my mom & her drunken rants. When i was younger I vividly remember my mom telling my older brother to call my father randomly in the middle of the day & tell him that we hate him.. now wether my brother actually did it or not im not sure, but the fact that my mom did such a thing & tried painting such a negative narrative is upsetting with all that has happened. Even to this day my mom still says “You are just like your father” whenever she’s upset with something i say or do whenever she’s drunk. I ask her not to speak his name in a negative way as he has obviously passed on. But she has no regard for it, or care to how it makes me feel. I nearly didn’t end up going to my dads funeral due to the tainted image my mom portrayed of him.. which is fucked up. By no means was he a saint, but to fuel your children up to hate someone who was trying his hardest to get through his own demons & be there & be present is something sad… it’s almost as if she wanted us to have no father. 

This was all over the place & i don’t want to keep rambling, but if anybody read this please let me know if i’m in the wrong, and ways to just deal with the stress of it all. I start therapy in march so obviously that’ll help me going forward but the next stretch of days are going to be rough for me.

It's only 3, 4, or 5 seltzers a day. Or wine, or champagne, or cider. On the weekends definitely more. In the last couple of years I have maybe not drank a total of 20 times, and usually only the day after a severe hangover.. I always thought it wasn't a problem because I know I can stop drinking, but I haven't wanted to. Now it's Sunday, February 13th and I'm sitting alone on my couch waiting to see if my husband is actually leaving me this time. Which I would not blame him to do so..

I'm 25 and have been drinking since I was 16. I had some party months and drank heavily, blacking out more than most of the time. Either at a friends house or party, or in my room with a friend. When I was 18 or so, bottles were usually supplied by my mom or dad, because hey, they'd rather I get it from them than a stranger. And I always stayed wherever the drinking started, so we had trust in that sense. Sometimes I wonder if I would have drank so much if it wasn't so accessible..

But it wasn't something I did most days until my boyfriend and I moved in together when we were 19, I think. We had the only apartment of all our friends so people were over constantly. We would drink 2-4 bottles of hard alcohol every weekend, between just a couple of us. My boyfriend, now husband, drank with us but he never got into it as much as I did. I would come home and hide in the kitchen to take shots so he didn't know how much I was drinking. We started to argue because like I said, when I drink more than 5 drinks of anything, I almost always blackout. I would wake up the next morning, not remembering a thing besides I fucked up. He would have to tell me all of the horrible things I said, the things I broke. The fucking awful person I was.

I stopped drinking hard alcohol like that, but I never stopped drinking. The blackout nights and fights always happened, but more spread out. And I'd like to think it was around the start of covid, but much before I started to drink every day. I come home from work and almost immediately grab a drink. I drink enough to get drunk, but not blackout. But sometimes I'll go to a friends, have people over, go out, or even at work events I will drink so much that I'm gone. It's like someone else takes over, and I have bits and pieces of memories the next day that make me feel ill. My relationship is not perfect, we fight whether I'm sober or not. But when we fight when I'm drunk, I disregard the fact that that man is my person, that he loves me and cares about me. Something starts a fight, and I explode. The night explodes. We scream and yell, and I say unforgivable things. I break shit in our home, I break shit in his car. I'm an extremely angry drunk and he takes the brunt of it all.

Last night was another one of those nights. We were driven home by a coworkers daughter who is my age and friend also, but I hardly remember anything besides wildly dancing and making an absolute fool of myself, per usual. Beyond that, I remember three moments. My husband slamming my phone so hard on the ground it shattered and bent, our friends showing up because I guess I told them they could, and my husband yelling at them to leave. And the next, I was asleep and woke up to fuck knows what. I was so disorientated, I didn't know what I saw or heard until I realized he was watching porn next to me in bed. We have a very comfortable relationship when it comes to masturbating and porn, but I felt very, very uncomfortable in that moment. We had fought all night, to which I still don't know what started it, and then to wake up to that..  Like just go the bathroom man. I know you're upset, but I'm still a person. We started to argue more, he told me he'd show me the videos of my from last night screaming and saying awful things. He said he was going to pack and leave in the morning.

He left, he brought back a new phone. Which I appreciate. And he's gone again, no bags in hand though. Our relationship isn't perfect. And I have a drinking problem. Which doesn't help. Even as I write this I question myself, but I don't want to drink anymore. I have said that before, yet I've never meant it enough to follow through. But I do not want to feel this way. I don't want to wonder what I did or said, or how embarrassing I was, or what I'm to going to say to my friend, coworker, my husband..

I don't want to wonder if this will be the time he actually leaves.",11,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5102481}"

I seriously don't know what has been going on with me these last years, but more and more, I know that I'm acting bad in certain ways and that it definitely has bad consequences, which I simply take into account and don't even care about them coming. I allow my life to get worse and worse; I've been struggling with an alcohol addiction for about 1,5 years now - that by itself has had multiple bad effects on my life, besides health-wise of course. Not showing up to meetings that me and the other person were looking forward to, just because getting blackout drunk the night before (alone) was more ""important"" to me. I also didn't show up to my shift one day, just because I was way too intoxicated to function - then and there (on that same day) I decided that I ""want to quit anyways"" (despite really having loved that job). My place in my dorm is an absolute mess, there was a bedbug infestation a few months ago that I still couldn't get rid of to this day (although I tried on multiple, sober occassions, with a whole plethora of anti-bedbug chemicals), and instead of telling it to the people working for that dorm, I simply kept my mouth shut, sometimes even kept on drinking to forget about it and ""take care of it tomorrow""; coincidentally, tomorrow is the day, they're going to check my room two months before I move out (that's just a routine thing before someone moves out, I decided to move somewhere else after graduating). I know the drinking has caused or deepened a lot of problems, but I'm also wondering if it's not the other way around, if the alcohol abuse is not actually a symptom of something bigger going on.

(Btw I'm a 23 year old guy living in Europe, I've never had anything that one could describe as a ""healthy relationship to alcohol"", it has always been binge-drinking for me whenever I drank since around 2019.

My parents both lost their factory jobs when I was in late elementary school. They were divorced that same year. Dad went his own route and I didn't see him so much as I lived full time with my mother. Her drinking got real bad. I didn't know how to handle it as a kid. Finally moved out at 15 and bounced around for awhile. 

Jump ahead eight years. I'm 23 now. An adult. We talk every once in awhile but only before 3ish (When she starts drinking). I get there late. She's already had a few. I try to talk to her about her drinking. Told her I wanted to have a good relationship with her like I did when I was a kid. Mentioned that she needs to at least be sober around me in order for that to happen. It infuriated her. Like a switch was flipped. 

I turn right back around to walk out of her house when she stops me, tells me to go cry to Al-Anon, and to fuck off. Fantastic. What a wonderful Saturday afternoon.

I should start by clearly saying I’m not an alcoholic. I had a period last year after turning 21 when i was doing 2-3 glasses a wine a night, but never ramped it up into bottles. I’m writing this because I’m curious to hear how people started. My drug of choice is weed, and when I got into it I was never uncomfortable. Sometimes now I feel myself getting paranoid or anxious, but never physically sick. Alcohol for me is often uncomfortable. Sometimes i binge a bit when I’m down, but that often turns into hangover, and even if it doesn’t I often make myself feel very bad if I drink a lot. It’s probably something with personality or genetics, but I just can’t envision myself relying on this substance, unless I was stupid and eased myself into routine drinking.

I guess my question is, did you feel sick from binging before building tolerance? I can’t imagine getting drunk every night just because I feel very sick when I drink a lot. I felt like I could understand it when I was keeping wine in the fridge all the time, but even then if I went for too much I’d get very barfy and have a terrible hangover. I still use alcohol as a crutch sometimes, so I guess I’m asking all of you because I have read enough on this sub to know that alcoholism is not something I want to fall victim to. I look forward to hearing from all of you; i know it’s weird to lurk on a substance abuse sub, but I have a lot of alcoholics in the family and that’s always made me worry about myself.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6487367}"

1. Give up Alcohol completely
2. Only drink on very special occasions e.g. new years, birthdays etc
3. Never more than 2 drinks and only occasionally e.g. glass of wine with a meal.

I want him back. I want to support him. His own parents and sisters told me I should leave him. I feel like I’m losing myself watching him go down this path.

I am honestly amazed she's still with us. She has no desire to stop taking oxycodone, drinking, smoking and hoarding. She could have gotten on a liver transplant list but she didn't want to stop drinking for 2 years. 

She opted for back surgery last month to relieve compressed discs. I cannot believe any doctor would operate on her with her comorbidities. We all tried to talk her out of it but she was in a lot of pain (hence the oxycodone).

Surgery went ok but 5 weeks later she's still in the hospital. She had COVID for two weeks so no one was allowed to visit. Her boyfriend went in a few days after she was cleared and told me she was skin and bones, which she already was.  She looks like a skeleton skin. It's devastating. 

I live over an hour away from the hospital she is in so I haven't been here every day since COVID. The doctor said  if she consistently has decent bowel movements, she'll be able to go to rehab (for physical therapy, not addiction). She hasn't eaten hardly anything for three weeks. What could she possibly have to poop out? I guess my question is how could the doctor not address the rapid weight loss until I called her freaking out about it. They brought a nutritionist in but it doesn't seemed to have done any good. I'm looking at her lunch tray. All she ate was a half cup of cole slaw. That's it. I brought her some of the small, individually wrapped peanut butter cups and she ate two.

Also, the hospital is also removing 4 liters of fluid from her belly every two days due to her paracentesis. 

The doctor swears this is normal for someone who's been in the hospital for an extended amount of time. She swears she's going to rehab. What rehab would take her? I think she is ready for hospice. The doctor said no she isn't. I don't really believe that my sister will recover from this. 

Of course, if there is something else going on with my sister and she doesn't want me to know, the doctor can't tell me.

I suspected things were going badly because of reduced contact, but I was not involved before. It looks like his numbers are improving and he will be discharged in a few days. I have not talked to a doctor because I'm far away and don't have medical power of attorney anyway.

On the phone today with me, the person was super clear and frank with me about his situation. He clearly knows he has a problem, but is struggling to recover:

* his boss knows of the drinking problem and is supportive
* he already has a therapist
* he already tried a recovery program some weeks ago, but couldn't stay on for the following reasons (according to him):
   * it was filled/dominated with people who were **not** like him (""functioning alcoholics"") but people who've hit bottom and were recovering for a long time -- he said those stories 'disrupted' the sessions and he would leave more depressed than when he started.
   * he didn't feel comfortable discussing his situation in the sessions, because it seemed too simple (e.g., his war stories of divorce, separation, etc. are nothing compared to someone recovering from a crack addiction).
* he can't stop drinking because of depression, anxiety and loneliness. 

All of this makes sense, and I'm hoping he can find another option for a recovery program with his therapist. 

But I wondered if anyone here who can relate to his perspective on recovery programs -- perhaps it's difficult to find a place with people more like him? Or, maybe, his attitude is that he's still in denial a bit? To me hospitalization for cirrhosis is a pretty bad ""war story"". Does one have to hit rock bottom before the therapy is beneficial? It seems hopeless to me.

I realize as a family member I have no control, but I would like to help in lending a hand on how to find better resources. He's really alone and been trying to manage it all without friends or family. There's an ongoing divorce (he's been separated from his wife for over a year, and she is on meds for anxiety and depression, she is also a big drinker, and there are two kids, all going to therapy). He travels weekly for his job. There are so many factors that aggravate the depression and anxiety.

I’m a first year uni student and I didn’t really drink until uni (had only a couple of drinks when I was 16). Ever since I started uni five months ago, I find myself drinking weekly as I go out clubbing or to a pub with my uni mates nearly every weekend.

As I started drinking more and more, I increasingly became more violent. I punched my male flatmates in the back multiple times on multiple occasions. I called multiple people names, but I mostly call one of my flatmate’s the c word even though he’s one of the nicest people I’ve met. I was throwing around horrific swear words at people for no reason. I’ve thrown tiny glass bottles on the walls of our kitchen. I kicked my flatmate in the leg so hard he had a bruise. I run off somewhere else and that’s how I lose my friends. It just goes on. 

We’re in a tiff about something else and now it’s awkward between me and my flatmates. Shit finally kinda hit the fan when my flatmates pretty much expressed that they’re now uncomfortable going out with me. They say that they feel like they have to look after me constantly which would ruin their night. I always ask the next morning if I ruined their night and they would say ‘no’ but I know that’s a lie. 

I had a talk with one of my flatmates regarding my drinking and he pretty much said that I am a completely different person when I’m drunk. He described me drunk in these words: “You see red”. He told me all the things I do whilst drunk and I was horrified, as I would never do any of those things sober. He said “You’re a lovely person sober but you’re so angry and aggressive when your drunk” and he states that most of the problems in the flat are due to my drunk actions towards other people. 

I would just like to know what the reasons for me being a completely different person drunk could be? I do have issues going in and I handle them the wrong way through drinking and aggression, but I am also wondering if this is how I am as a person and my drunk ness  reveals the real me? I also sometimes think I can be a boring person so I would drink so I can be a bit more exciting and energetic to be around with.

I am also seeking advice on how I can chill out on my drinking but still have a good time. This whole situation has put me off on drinking and i always promise that I can stop drinking as much but the next day we go out i’m back on that cycle again and I drink to that same level once again. It’s getting tiring quite frankly for my flatmates and especially myself.

I haven't been dating this man very long, and we recently became exclusive. His communication dipped down way lower than normal right after...basically this past week. And I found out why, I believe yesterday.

Had a long talk with him where he confided in me that he is an alcoholic. He's been sober for half a year now...up until recently when we started dating. We have had a few dates where we've had drinks - my suggestion (sake w sushi, etc), and instead of having that discussion, he broke his sobriety.

On my side, I can understand the hesitancy in going through that conversation with someone you're just getting to know. On the side of me that has an alcoholic relative, I do understand the importance of maintaining sobriety. And on that side, too, I know I can support recovery but can't make someone else do anything.

He is in AA, and has a sponsor. He has spoken with his sponsor about these incidents...and I'm guessing that's why he had this conversation with me. Not saying anything further threatens his path toward sobriety, and that's not good. I guess the positives are that he is now being forthcoming and transparent about this, has admitted that he slipped up, and has a sponsor and is maybe taking responsibility for his actions?

And I'm fine with not drinking around him, etc. But I'm looking for questions to help me better understand where he is at and I guess that's why I am here.

If you've had a loved one that you would want to understand you more, and understand your life and path, what would you want them to know? What questions would you appreciate them asking, and what questions do you think should be asked in understanding and being an ally in your path? And perhaps what questions do I need to be thinking about for my better understanding, so I can honestly evaluate the risks of continuing on with this relationship?

I'm not going to be or pretend to be anyone's savior here and try to rescue anyone. If he struggles and wants to talk about it, I'm open to hear his struggles - although my go-to there would likely be listen, then suggest he call his sponsor. So, I'm not so much looking to temper questions on his behalf, but more so ask the questions that I need to know so I can measure my own expectations.

First off. I've been to prison, was a drug user and general fuck up. So I'm coming at this from a place of deep empathy and understanding.

Let's call him johnny- my neighbor. Lives above us in the quadplex. He is a severe alcoholic. Almost end stage, is having severe health problems. Blood clots, liver failure, you name it. 

He wasn't responding to phone calls from his 8 year old daughter the other night, so she contacted us and asked if we would knock on his door. He apparently has sole custody of his daughter? Which is a problem in my eyes, it's not a healthy environment for a kiddo. The house is a disaster- he just can't keep up with housework in his state. 

He didn't answer the door so his daughter asked her grandpa, his dad, who is also an alcoholic, to go check on him. He did, found him passed out in front of the toilet, called the ambulance and he stayed overnight. 

He asked to make us dinner as a thank you, and I could tell it was really important to him, so I graciously accepted. He is in denial somewhat, probably mostly out of embarrassment. Pride can be a painful thing to let go of. 

I don't know how to help him. He's going to die. We are watching a man slowly kill himself. I can't hire him to work for me because he's not in any state to work, and he's blinded to how bad of a rut he's in. He's only 35 years old. 

Any advice would be carefully considered and extremely appreciated. Johnny doesn't need to die or end up crippled. I want to help and want to know how.

I drive to the liqour store and buy my drink of choice, and I can't even wait to take a few drinks before I leave the parking lot. I get home, maybe eat maybe not, it depends on how drunk I am or hungover from the night before. 

Then repeat the next day. 

On my days off I do the same, I don't wake up and drink. I don't even think about it, once again I think about quiting drinking because I feel like absolute shit and know I am destroying my body. Most days I don't start craving a drink or thinking about it until the evening. Then, without hesitation I go and buy my bottle for the night. All the while, in my head, or even sitting in the parking lot of the liqour store I sit there and contemplate what the fuck am I doing.

i think i just need to talk. i hope someone can talk to me. 

bf and i have been together 6 years. we never fight or argue, we have disagreements about various social ideas from time to time but they're always calm discussions. we love each other a bunch. we get along so well. 

he's had a drinking problem thats gotten worse over the past year. he's been in therapy for a few weeks now. i just learned his therapist told him he needs to commit to being single before he can get sober. i asked how he feels about her suggestion and he said, ""i am afraid to be alone. but i think i agree that i might need to understand what that means"". 


so uh yeah im really sad now. i said to him, i understood from the moment he started developing these issues that his personal well-being should come first over our relationship. meaning, i knew we would have less hanging out, he would give less affection, he would need alone time, he might need to go to inpatient care, etc. i want him to take care of himself. 

i explained this to him, i said i just want to be here to provide the love when he needs/wants it, and for him to know i am here just for him, all of my love is for him. i am with him to support him thru all of the highs and lows. i explained i dont have any expectations romance-wise. i just want to enjoy the moments we *do* get to have. the occasional sleep over, a random cute text, whatever, ya know? 

i am okay with this idea. im not interested in becoming interested with anyone else so it's not like he is holding me back from having a more available/attentive/whatever partner. it doesnt hurt me that he has to put more time into himself. i understand he would need to be able to accept that too. 


idk whats right or wrong medically speaking. if we were married would she be telling him to get a divorce??


unfortunately i do feel really sad about this. i feel like a decision is being made without my full input, but isnt that just what breaking up is? maybe i dont have a choice and it really ultimately doesnt matter how i feel? because being an alcoholic could really kill him. i cant stop crying. 


he has not responded to my message yet when i explained how i am okay with him focusing on himself. im not pushing for a response im just gonna wait and be patient. usually when i get bad feelings like this  about things in life, the bad thing does happen. im a mess.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4795428}"

I can't have just this one tonight. From the outside I've got it all. Incredibly successful career, marriage that is healing after a really rough 2 years, beautiful home, and wonderful family. But damn, drinking is this fucked up undercurrent to it all. The amount of money I sink into alcohol every week is *disgusting*. I can't moderate any more. It's ruining my body, my sleep, my brain function. I push through and push it down and everyone thinks I'm still doing excellently. 

But then I have a girls night and even though I only brought 1 drink with me in order to force myself to moderate I end up drinking stuff that gets pulled put by the host and there goes my plan. I end up oversharing and telling them something I really should not have. Now today I'm filled with dread. Do I text my friends to do damage control? Ignore it until next time I see them? Are they texting about it today talking about me? I have a pit in my stomach about it. And I wouldn't if I just hadn't been drinking. I have a trip coming up and as much as I'm excited I'm also so worried about the drinking. It's a heavy drinking group but I always drink extra heavy compared to everyone else. I have been trying to come up with ways to keep myself from drinking too much and making an ass out of myself and normal people don't need to make those sort of plans ahead of time. 

The other sobriety sub talks about finding things to do to replace the drinking. Well, what am I supposed to do when a large part of my drinking is bc my life is monotonous. Work from home, get toddler from daycare, come home, play for a min, make dinner, watch tv/play w toddler, bedtime, watch tv with husband. Day after day always the same. I can't go to the gym or exercise all the time to like they suggest when I need (and want!) to be parenting and spending time with my kid. I'm constantly stuck at home and I'm bored. Going one night a week wouldn't stop it, bc when I *was* going to the gym one night a week I'd still grab wine on the way home. Drinking just makes everything less boring. Drinking is just always with me while I do the regular life things. How do I extricate it when it has become a part of the process and practically part of my hand? 

But I'm sick of feeling like this, very mildly hungover while working and feeling anxious and depressed over my actions. I have to figure out ways on my own. I can't ""replace"" the drinking time with something else since I was drinking while doing normal day to day family/house routines. Those will always be the same and I have to just I don't know, play the tape forward. Remind myself of feeling this way. Talk to my therapist. Dive into my hobby more to get out of the house more regularly. Anything. I just can't moderate anymore, and I'm not going to be this person.

I have talked to my husband about this and he is 100% understanding and is doing his best to help me stay sober. I’m also researching local AA meetups in my area and have sought professional help. 
We gave the bottle of wine to some neighbours who drink responsibly so that is at least out of the house now. 

I’ll start off by saying I used to drink a bottle of tequila every night for a long time. Tequila was my poison , but I’d take vodka in a pinch. This was back when I was living with my abusive parents, over 2 years ago. Since then I’ve completely changed my life: moved to Australia, married to my best friend, finally got diagnosed with endometriosis, etc. Things were really good until my BIL started acting hostile (he’s not physically/bodily violent but verbally and emotionally he is very violent) towards me, as of about 6 months ago. My parent-in-laws assure me I’m making it up but I’m not. My husband sees it too but with the situation we’re in currently (recovering from covid that got passed to us from a family member) we haven’t been able to get jobs and safely move out. And because of this unsafe feeling and constant anger towards me I’ve really wanted to drink again. There’s a bottle of wine in the pantry. There’s a bottle shop within walking distance. I can feel myself spiraling down even though I haven’t relapsed yet. I say yet because it’s a possibility, I hope I’ll be able to hang on until I can actively do something to better my situation but it’s still a possibility. I don’t have many people I can talk to about this outside my husband and I feel like the poor man deserves a break from my emotional whirlwind. We’re both having a terribly hard time but only one of us is a recovering alcoholic. I don’t want ruin 2 years of progress , I really don’t but I am struggling.

He comes from a dysfunctional family with a father who’s also an alcoholic and not particularly good for him to live with.
We met last year and he more or less came over and never left, so lives with my mother and I. He is the most amazing person I’ve ever known and he completes me in so many ways. We love him so much.

Now, not to be one of those who make someone else’s suffering about themselves, but it’s worth noting that my father passed away last year due to pancreatic cancer induced by alcoholism. I hate myself every single day for not doing enough to stop him getting sick, and there is no way I am going to allow the man I want to spend the rest of my life with succumb to the same thing. Let me stress, I want him to get better ultimately for himself, but also for us to have the happy life we both deserve, together.

Today is his first day since last year that he’s attempting to not have a single drink. That’s a big step considering his average is around 8 a day, but that is how he wants to try it right now and I’ll respect that. He has multiple attempts at sobering himself under his belt and in the past, before I knew him, he had done incredibly until his mental health plummets due to abuse from his ex girlfriend. 
He’s worried about his constant stomach pain and frequent vomiting so he’s made a call to his doctor about looking into that, with hesitation I’ll admit, but if there is something seriously wrong with his health we have to know. So that’s another big step! 

Being in detox and mental health wards at the hospital for weeks on end simply does not work for him. When he had gone 4 whole months sober last time, that was on his own accord due to his self discipline.
I simply need any tips that can help me be a good support system for him, I’ll do anything to take care of him and make this journey go as smoothly as it possibly can.

She did not had a easy life and god knows ive been supportive but every single day she drinks 1 to 2 bottles of wine and its a rollercoaster of discussions.
This is not healthy, for her, for me and more importantly for our kids.
I have talked about this but for her it always comes down to the fact that she is not the issue.
All of my family have noticed, previous social encounters ended up with her completely intoxicated  and with us arguing for hours and still Im the issue just due to simple fact that I mentioned her state of mind. 
I feel completely trapped and powerless to change anything at this stage. She had a psychiatrist who she was consulting but she only shares what she wants to share with the psychiatrist and for her alcohol is not an issue.
Ive read countless articles which pretty much states that she needs to hit rock bottom and have a wake up call so that she seeks help. My fear is that her roxk bottom might end up dragging for too long or having huge consequences for me and for my kids.

I was going to a party the next day so I wanted to see my tolerance, since the day before I went to a party -- fully sober and all -- and it was awful.

Drinking 2 cans alone did nothing except make me dizzy. The next day during the party I drank more, and eventually it became amazing!! I was talking so much and having a great time. I have severe social anxiety disorder which I take meds for, and although I felt nervous still, it was like the non-obsessive benefits of my meds + easing up on my self-control from alc made me feel so much better. I feel like my true, normal self when I'm drunk. Seriously, everyone was saying I am a happy and fun drunk -- in sharp contrast to my usual serious, shy self -- and I felt it too.

I've been drinking every day since then, but not to the point of getting as drunk as I did during the party. I took just 1 day off. Before I took the day off, I went to work, met with my boss and did a job interview all while kinda tipsy. I think all those things went way better than they would have if I was sober. But I still felt bad because I know it's not good to do those things while drinking.

I also didn't get any hangovers or other side effects besides dizziness when I'm drunk or tipsy. But I'm vision impaired so I'm always kinda dizzy and knocking things around. 

I know I should probably stop so I'm scheduling extra time with my psychiatrist to talk about this. Alcoholism runs in my family, and my grandmother is homeless because of it. But I love the feeling, and I have always been so depressed and shy my whole life. Therapy hasn't worked much and the meds only help with some parts of my anxiety. The rest really feels like some kind of deficiency in my brain, like I have too much self-restraint or something which leads to extreme avoidance.

Are there any alternatives to alcohol or how can I drink in a healthy way? I don't really have any friends and no one to talk to besides my psych. I heard benzos give a similar effect, and I could probably get them since I already have horrible anxiety.

I’m 23 and have had a drinking problem since I was 18. Although I did well in college, I spent most of my days drinking alone in my room. This stemmed from the fact that I felt like I couldn’t relate to the people around me. Regardless, I’ve been out of college for almost a year now, and it keeps getting worse. I alternate between binges and bouts of sobriety. Over the past year for instance, I did a month sober, two months sober, and then another month sober. In between this I was on a binge the rest of the time. Every time I become sober, a “friend” (I have a lot of bad influences in my life) convinces me that it will be okay to drink again, despite me describing to them countless times how much of a negative impact alcohol has had on my life. This one night out always turns into me two months later not being able to go to sleep unless I drink 7 or 8 beers. In the past I’ve always reached a low point which motivated me enough to stop, albeit with really intense anxiety and confusion for a couple of days, but it’s only getting harder and harder each time. I can just see myself really going off the deep end unless I quit forever.

I only drink at night time, and on my current binge I’ve consumed around 8 beers every night for the past three weeks (I’ve drank a 12 pack the last three nights though). I need to figure my life out and this is the age to do it. The drinking has been getting in the way big time, and I know I absolutely need to stop if I don’t want to end up a complete mess later in life.  I just can’t handle alcohol. I have a few questions for you. 

How much of a risk do I have for serious withdrawals requiring medical attention? (I’ve only been drinking for three weeks on this binge and was sober for a month before it started, but the horror stories online scare the living daylights out of me)

What do you recommend I do to prevent myself from convincing myself I can drink and relapsing again? (I can never make it more than a month or two)

What should I do about my friends (who are also alcoholics but won’t admit it to themselves)?

I really appreciate any advice you may have. Please help me get through this.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6716556}"

I’m not so much wondering if I am an alcoholic, I’m just looking for some perspective. 

I drink to the extent that some would consider alcoholism. I can (and do) drink a fifth a day with ease and I’ll drink more if I’m going out. I’m a big dude and I can handle my liquor much more than other people. I drink nearly every day, whether I’m alone or going out. I’m in college and am stable in that regard, but drinking takes up a significant amount of time, and money. I black out a lot, but very rarely get hung over. Basically what I’m trying to say is I drink often and heavy. 

However, I don’t consider myself dependent at all. I never “crave” alcohol in the sense where I feel physically ill or emotionally ailed if I don’t have a drink. I know that if I wanted to stop drinking, I could do it with ease and I have taken large breaks in the past. I just don’t want to stop, because it’s fun.

I struggled with life for a bit. I met a friend S who was a few years older than me but had no job. I tried to be a good friend and took her to several job interviews. My friend S had a problem with alcohol. I was in the middle of grieving so for awhile I turned to hard core partying with her. I had never been a badass and was always a rule follower. Quickly I realized I turned into a massive AH. Fortunately the turning point was when I received a job offer in the legal field. My lifestyle had to stop. I turned my life around and stopped binge drinking. My friend S ended up getting into drugs and even stole my prescription meds. That was the final straw of our friendship. Over the years, S has tried to get me to be friends with her again. I refused. In my hometown where S lives we have a community page. I have moved away. The other night I posted about a very bad accident. Underneath the comments section was S’s mom saying I needed to quit judging people and that I’m on a high horse. She then went on to say I have ruined her daughters life. I have not had any contact with S besides these FB messages that occur every couple of years. I also after the comment was made I  received a message from her mom saying to quit being an asshole. Ofcourse this got people in the community talking so I responded to S mom that I was friends with her daughter in 2010, don’t have a high horse and am not perfect. Then blocked S mom and made sure daughter was blocked as well. People in the community have sided with me saying that S mom was wrong for bringing that up on a community page. I feel for S and I wish she would get help. Since friendship ended she gotten her 8th DUI and she even a charge of endangering children. I’m a different person now.

She gets drunk maybe one every 2 or 3 months and rarely ever has a drink outside of that, but she's also very small and has a low tolerance.

About 6 months ago she went out with a group of friends and got black out drunk. Her friends estimate she had between 10 and 20 drinks and we're surprised she didn't have alcohol poisoning that night. 

Ever since then, anytime she gets drunk or high (Marijuana) she experiences tingling in her hands and feet and they go numb. Usually this lasts for a day and then wears off, but something different is happening. 

We got high a few nights ago (VERY small amount of Marijuana. We rarely drink or smoke) and the numbness is way worse. She is relatively numb and experiencing the tingling you get when your arm or foot falls asleep, but across her entire body.  We're on day 3 now and she says it's getting way worse. Yesterday it was just hands and feet. Now it's everywhere. 

Everything we've read online makes it sound like neuropathy, but we can't figure out how it would have happened. She only experiences it when she gets drunk or high.

I wake up in the morning still feeling like a looser, but I at least didn’t down an entire bottle of vodka. 



But any time I get on the phone with someone at night (which is why I try not to talk to people at night) or when my sibling comes to stay the night, I just end up taking it to an extreme level. Always, always end up blacked out and even before I really wake up I know immediately I’ve fucked up so badly, feeling the crushing effects of hangover and extreme anxiety about what stupid shit I even said or did. It’s literally the worst feeling ever. Ever ever. Yet I still keep doing this shit. 



If I talk to people during the day I end up shaking, sweating, feeling so much anxiety. So a lot of times I just never answer my phone and everyone always complains that I’m “the hardest person to get in touch with”. Well what they don’t know is I avoid them because it stresses me out and I don’t know why. I have a lot of resentment towards cell phones. I don’t want one anymore. I’m so sick and tired of people expecting that I should answer just because they called and they are getting mad. I’m sick of being tied to this device. I wish I could go back to the days of landlines where it was not expected people would answer and we just had answering machines for that reason. People didn’t generally get pissed when they didn’t get in touch with you. Now days it’s like because I have a cell phone people think I’m looking at my phone 24/7 and ignoring their call on purpose. 



That’s not true I’ve tried to make an effort to be off my phone and sometimes I lose track of where my phone is even at. But yes, there are times I see someone calls and I don’t answer it because I’m not in the mindset to talk. 



Anyways, the time will come where I see someone calling in the evening and I know I’ve not responded enough and I feel pressured to answer so I do. I answer or call them back and I start drinking right away. And then no matter if the conversation is good or bad, I keep knocking back the shots. To an extreme degree that I don’t do when I’m not talking to people. It’s like I can’t have a conversation and be normal, or not stressed, unless I’m drinking. But then I take it too far. 



So then when I wake up the next day, the entire day I’m cringing and freaking out about the stuff I remember, and panicking about what I possibly did that I don’t remember, hiding from my phone, logging out of my social media because I’m terrified about what stupid shit I’ve said and I can’t even face it. I can’t even stomach to see notifications. It’s crazy. 



Like why…. How is it I can go through that all day and then when 7pm hits, I’m back to drinking again. Thinking I can somehow only have one or two drinks when that’s never going to happen. 


I really, really hate myself. It won’t be long before everyone I’ve ever known and a bunch of people I don’t know hate me just as much. Obviously there’s no good answer here other than getting clean which I feel is absolutely impossible at this point. By the end of the day I’m so extremely stressed out and feeling pain in my body it feels impossible not to drink to make it all stop. But I also get so pissed off at myself that I can go through so much torment all day about what I did while drinking then just go and do it again and again and again.

I feel I’ve gotten over any initial withdrawal symptoms. However my issue at the moment is the ritual nature of the  habit.  I used to have a very set regime. I’d be at work 8-7 most days. I’d never drink at work or whilst working from home during working hours. However I would then drink on the way home and for the rest of the evening. Life was literally split in two. 

I’m finding that period between leaving work and getting home/ eating dinner the hardest. I’m just getting the constant feeling of wanting a beer. I haven’t succumbed yet but just wondering if there are any tips to take your mind off it. I’ve so far avoided the gym as I used to basically drink on the way home after. However once I feel I can trust myself more I may return. 

In my mind I have the reference of quitting smoking. I quit a few years ago. I found then that the initial pain of quitting was far worse than what I’ve experienced with alcohol. However after 2-3 weeks that nagging feeling of habit and wanting that cigarette eventually went away and I just naturally stopped thinking about it. 

So I’m wondering 1. Any tips on how to get over the pangs and 2. Does it go away over time. Realise that’s a somewhat facetious  way to express this but I can only frame it in the context of my experience with smoking!

My story

Been a casual drinker all my adult life, but since COVID I find I have 2-4 drinks every day. Lately, that's turned into sipping an oz of rum when I start work at 6-7 am because I feel withdrawl in my head. I'll have another couple oz in the afternoon; sometimes it doesn't abate the feeling.

I do not binge drink ever, rarely get drunk and silly -- just 2-4 drinks, 365 days a year. Maybe I used to drink to mask depression, but right now I drink for the same reason smokers take cig breaks.

I'm more or less in control of my career and have good relationships with kids/wife (non drinker).

But the key thing: I have no plan to stop drinking altogether. I just want to cut back from 20+ drinks a week to 3-5 a week, which was my lifestyle before COVID... A few glasses of wine on evenings, without feeling chemically driven to do so.

Drinking at 7 am is F'ed up. I'm doing long-term damage. I'm middle aged, into health, and don't want to wake up one day with my organs saying ""F U, guy.""

I had like one rough day, the rest have been kinda boring, but not very hard. 

I think it has been easier for me because I haven't committed to never touching alcohol again for the rest of my life. When I think about doing that, I kinda panic, so I benefit from a more casual attitude. Booze wasn't causing any huge problems for me, other than overall shitty health and empy wallet (but I have very few expenses so that wasn't really an issue), I just decided to take a substantial break (at least 3 months) because my relationship with drinking had become unhealthy. I expect to get to a point where I can have a healthy relationship with drinking again. However, if I find out that I'm incapable of that, it's nice to know that I can do sobriety without suffering.

I am so disgusted with myself at times it is hard to cope, and so again i turn to beer. I know alcoholism is a disease and it runs in my family so i try not to judge myself too harshly, but i have gotten to a point i have no pride in.

I started drinking when i was 14 years old. I would go to a bar n’ grill with my parents and they would get me a glass of cheap champagne if i had been good lately. I thought that was just fun.

Then it turned into me driving my parents’ dunk friends home when i had never driven a car before. When i had also had a drink or two. Then that turned to my parents yelling at me for my drinking when they were the ones who, almost, encouraged it. 

I had so much shit i couldn’t process at the time, that when i learned what it felt like to have a buzz, i craved it. It made everything fade out. That’s what i love about it. Have a problem? Two beers later and everything feels okay again. I know it never makes the situation okay. But it takes away the fucking primal fear of dealing with some situations.

As a person with diagnosed GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) i believe this was a crucial coping mechanism for myself at the time. I believe that is why it’s so bad for myself now. I thought it would always be one drink, then it’s okay. 

Now i plan my work day around if i have time to drink one or two beers, and how i’m gonna get them if i don’t have any. A day without one beer ready makes me fucking panic.

Throughout my adult life I have probably drank too much, and mostly alone.

My typical pattern for quite a while would be Sat - Tuesday sober, Wednesday drink a 6 pack, Thursday sober, Friday drink a 6 pack or bottle of wine or little bit more.

Last couple of years it's probably escalated somewhat, to where 90% of days I would have 2 - 6 beers, and at least once a week have 7 - 12 beers or equivalent.

It is clearly alcohol abuse by any reasonable standard, and generally if I have 1 or 2 drinks, I will tip over a point where I want to have 5 or 6 or maybe even 10, basically drinking until I become sleepy and pass out.

Fortunately I mostly stuck to beer & wine and never got too much into hard liquor, though I do like the occassional rum  or whisky.

But why? The pop-explanation has never really sat too well with me. I drink because I am an addict, I have the addiction because I am susceptible and drank too much?

It doesn't really sit right with me, and I want to  work through what is happening from an intuitive perspective:

**This is what alcoholism feels like from the inside:**

I work all day in an environment which is emotionally tiring. I am an introvert, and I spend all day in meetings where political opponents are looking for a weakness to target. I have to be on the ball, and hypervigilant.

As the day nears a close I am emotionally exhausted and agitated from all this, I want to relax, and I certainly don't feel like going to the gym.

I crack open a beer, and it takes the edge off, time slips away a little more quickly, the chattering in my head dies down, I stop ruminating on the day that was, start to laugh and enjoy some stupid movie or music.

The optimal level is reached after 2 or 3 drinks, beyond that point I drink at a steady pace to maintain a roughly consistent level of intoxication, until I get sleepy and pass out contendedly. Sometimes I sleep through to morning, sometimes I might wake up needing to take a piss. Probably I don't feel great in the morning if this has happened more than 1 night in a row, which makes the next day harder.

**I haven't had a drink in about 2 weeks:**

The only real reason for this is that I have been managing my calendar better, and it sounds stupid, but taking a nap around 3:30pm when I would normally be agitated and revving up for a beer.

I have no particular desire to drink alcohol, I flirted with the idea once or twice but couldn't be bothered putting the 6 pack in the fridge. I have a dozen bottles of wine, some champagne and beers sitting around.

Traditionally I might have thought about this as ""removing a trigger"", but it isn't really a trigger I'm managing at all, it's my own emotional state.

**What I'm wondering**

Is this really what I needed all along? A nap? Could my years of alcohol abuse be down to something this stupid? Was I an alcoholic or just an emotionally tired person all along? And if I was (am?) an alcoholic, why does that identity go away if I have a nap?

If I go out with friends and have a few drinks, will my desire for booze somehow come back with a vengeance? Should I become a teetotaler just so I don't have to find out?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7263059}"

I take drinks almost exclusively on my days off as I'm chilling home on my own; my work schedule is  usually around 8AM-5PM on weekdays, so alcohol is usually only on Sat and Sun. On those days, I start my first drink around 2ish PM and take sips through the next couple hours until 7-8. I typically drink a total of around 500ml (17 oz) of vodka on such a day mixed with juice (OJ + lemonade). I'd say I never or rarely reach drunk stage, but maybe heavily tipsy.

Why do I drink? Mostly to add a bit of fun to a regular day; it puts me in goofy mood, I get more into singing along to music, I watch silly stuff online and laugh and react kinda loudly, that kind of stuff. I don't think I'm drinking to distract myself from sadness or life problems, but sometimes when I get bored, I think of having a drink as a kind of solution. And some days I do feel like I'm having more fun, but its pretty common afterwards that I think back of the day before and realize that it did not really add fun to the day.

I believe I have a small addiction at this point. I had a week off recently, and I had those drinks every one of those 9 days from that saturday to the sunday of the week after. Sometimes on such days, I'd think to myself that I should not have a drink the next day; gotta have moderation, better for my health and wallet, etc. But as the hours pass, my thoughts transform to things like ""why shouldn't I drink"", like I'd try to find excuses to justify that I should still have a drink that day.

At least I don't think I reached a point where my alcohol intake is affecting big parts of my life negatively: I would not refuse to hang out with friends as if I would ""lose a day"" of drinking. It is not affecting my work or relationships, I never really get hungover (I think I'm good to stay hydrated), but it does affect my sleep of the following night; I keep waking up several times around 3 AM and sometimes unable to sleep again.

I also use alcohol as a bit of a crutch regarding cleaning up: My biggest issue in life is lack of initiative, and my place can get messy over time, and messiness really does not bother me. So to push me to make effort to keep my place minimally clean, I've been using the ""strategy"" on most of those days that I'm not allowed to start drinking unless I've started to take care of some chore like dishes or sweeping the floor or whatever. 

I'm a 34 year old single guy, living alone with 2 cats since last June (before that I was living with the same roommate for 12 years). I'm not really shy socially but I'm definitely introverted that I require regular alone time. I also have a video game addiction on a similar level that it doesn't ruin my work or relationships, but video games is basically all I do with my free time. 

TLDR: I drink on all my days off (weekends and recent whole week off) to level of heavily tipsy, does not really seem to negatively affect my life, but I have thoughts of finding excuses to drink anyway if I'd been thinking of skipping that day.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5183696}"

Drinking has become a staple in my social life, but I can’t drink like the people around me do. All of my friends drink because they can handle their shit. They can go out and get shitty on a Saturday night once a month and have a beer or two after work every now and then. I can’t.

I don’t even enjoy drinking most of the time. The only time I do enjoy it is when I go out to the bars or to a party with my friends.

I stopped drinking for around 3 months previously. Then I convinced myself that I was ""better"". Hid behind all sorts of justifications.

""It helps me relax/It is a treat/I enjoy it""

Now it has been around 8 months. I'm drinking 4-6 pints a day. I wake up everyday feeling like hell. My kidneys feel tender. I struggle to make it through the day because I am largely trapped in a life I don't want. Work a job I don't mind but don't feel passionate about. My son I love but I feel now he is getting older, he wants to spend less time with me and more time with friends online. I struggle to arrange childcare because my support network has fallen apart due to a Narcissistic father who I had to cut out of my life.

Some days I feel content for brief moments. Other times I feel absolute despair. Heartache. Feel so alone bar my son and work colleagues, who are the closest things I have to friends. It feels like I'm just treading water until death takes me but I don't want to die. I can't die or my son is alone. I've tried a few nights to stop and the withdrawal is really bad. I feel nauseous. Sweat. Feel tired. I can't go to work like this. I tried and it was tough.

2022-02-02 12:00:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/sitou9/is_this_a_problem/,is this a problem?,"hi there. i’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, and my post likely won’t be as organized as i’d like (i am sober, i just have a lot of things to say and i don’t know how best to say them.) 

i’m not sure if i have an alcohol problem or not. 

in high school i was caught stealing liquor from my parents that i was using every night before school to get drunk with a friend on facetime, usually s**f h**ming at the time. at the time i also took lots of pills (opiates, ambien, uppers, etc) recreationally to manage living with an abusive father. 

this was a long time ago- i was 14-15 years old. a lot of things have changed since then. i’m 23 now. i live abroad, have a full time job, live by myself in an apartment, and am essentially functioning very well. my struggles with mental health since then have become much easier to manage with medication and routine.

one thing i still worry about, though, is my drinking. 

i have a drink almost every night. it’s usually no more than 1-2 beers; but these beers are 16oz and 6-7 percent alcohol (i’m 5’6” and 108 pounds.) i usually do this while reading or crocheting or whatever- it doesn’t make me feel any type of way in the morning. 

when i do go out with my friends to get drunk, i really struggle to stop drinking. i call it “fiending” because i’m constantly thinking about my next drink, cigarette, etc to level up. i don’t really take into account the vibe of the outing or my friends (if they seem to want to only have one drink or whatever)- I keep drinking and hope that everyone will keep going for as long as they can with me. i don’t really pressure them to, but i’m always just hoping they’ll join me. 

my friends must not be bothered enough by this to mention any of it to me on their own yet, but i think about it a lot. i wonder if i’m being burdensome. 

if the night ends and they have to go home, i will stop at a convenience store to get more alcohol to drink at home alone if nobody else will join me. 

i’ve had a few instances in my life where i have gotten so drunk that i have had meltdowns in front of others. this is literally so rare that it’s happened maybe 3 times total in my 8-9 years of drinking, but i’m scared of it nonetheless. 


putting it all out here i guess it does sound like a problem. i have lots of alcoholics on both sides of my family and suspect that my mother might struggle with drinking a bit too much herself. 

does anyone have any advice for me based on their own experience with anything similar? does it sound serious or manageable? i want to minimize the effect this has on the people in my life, but i don’t want to lose the part of life that is going out with my friends while i’m young. thanks a lot.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5044832}"

He has recently lost his job. 
He has lost his license due to driving under the influence. 
He has now got a family violence order against him after smashing my parents property and becoming violent.

For context: 

- He lives with my parents (at almost 30 years old).
- He drinks everyday.
- He can’t hold a job for extended periods of time (He is a good worker when he applies himself).
- He has been in and out of therapy and psych wards (his own decision), however they always say they cannot treat him because he doesn’t want treatment.
- My parents refuse to kick him out of the house.
- I (28) have my own house, and am safe from his actions.
