My mother and him are separated(not divorced) and he no longer lives in the house we all used to live in as a family. I’m living at home with my mom during the summer I have virtually no relationship with my father anymore at this point nor does my mom however his name is still on the house we live in. He gets very erratic and verbally abusive when he’s drunk( which is every night) but has never actually been physically violent towards us. Today he came to our house to work on the deck like he had several times before as we are planning to sell our house. He insisted on taking our dog back to his trailer park for the weekend and my mom said no but he insisted. My mom often backs down when he confronts her as she has been conditioned by years of his mind games and abuse so I knew he would eventually get her to cave and allow him to take the dog which is a problem because she is very old and needs constant maintenance not to mention him driving drunk with her so I brought my dog into my room and locked the door and barracaded it with a big chair he eventually came up screaming to take my dog and kicked a hole in my door. At this point I called the police and he started yelling at my mom. At the top of the stairs he briefed grabbed my moms shoulders but my sister quickly intervened. He has been having drunken stupors like this for years but it just feels different this time he lost his job a few years ago for getting arrested multiple days in a row trying to board a flight intoxicated and was sentenced to two years probation I just feel like he has nothing left to lose and he may just one day decide he wants to take it out on my family. I’m really scared I’m just asking does if anyone knows if alcoholics are likely to be violent if they haven’t been before. Sorry if this is poorly written I just am worried about my family the police gave us papers to file a restraining order but I’m worried that when he gets served with it he won’t honor it or will do something crazy in anger.,3

I’ll start off with about me I’m 23 and really struggling again, I started drinking mildly at 12 but it started taking over around 16. I used to be involved with street life heavily and used it to cope with that and stomach shit I otherwise couldn’t, a bit over a year ago I punched out 2 cops almost destoyed a cruiser and got myself ran over by a car and needed major surgery all of course while drunk, and it caused me to lose my girl the only person I ever considered my family or person I’ve had feelings for since I got her caught up in shit.  

After that I got sober for about 6 months I really hated myself and had to see the effects of my addiction every day, with my ruined body and leg had to pay my lawyer 10grand, and had to pick myself back up alone because I’ve pushed everyone away and torched most my bridges. That pushed me to get sober. I started working out, eating 3 meals a day, working out everyday and started my job back up after the injury. Things were going so well for about 6 months but I saw that girl with her new boyfriend she covered our tattoos he had the normal life I was striving so hard for and I still felt like a dumb hood rat. I started binge drinking again and the results were bad since I was sober for a bit, I went nuts hooked up with a bunch of girls and started not caring trying to deal with how I felt. I was getting wasted before work and all the progress I made I destroyed. 

The feeling of needing to be better and the person I want is more powerful then the alcohol so I got sober again for another 5 months. But idk what happened about a month ago I relapsed again I’m not sure why and I’ve been drinking everyday, I can barely leave my apartment I’ve been inside for 2 weeks I’ve never been like that my anxiety is so bad I need to always do shit but now I’m sleeping 15hours a day and can’t sleep at night. I’m seeing an addiction councillor, I’ve fought this a long time so I know walking reading or doing some of my hobby’s can be a huge help. But nothing is helping anymore, I’m at a fucking loss. I’m angry at myself for going another 5 months and relapsing, I’m mad only one day after drinking I feel regret and after one day sober I just wanna get fucked up again. I feel like a joke and don’t want people to see me visibly struggling. It’s like I feel guilty about everything and drink to deal with guilt about drinking, it doesn’t make any sense. I have considered rehab but I can detox on my own and get to half a fucking year why do I keep folding. How do I get myself back on track right now when it all feels so fucking pointless and easier to resign myself to this shit. 

I know this was a big shit show of a post lol. But any help or tips would be appreciated, or if anyone just wants to talk feel free to msg me. Thanks everyone",3

Now it’s July and I’m bloated, people have commented at work how I was looking pretty fit for a while and now ask what happened to that me.

I only have my sister in my life, never been in love and probably never will be, no friends. So of course when I’m not working I drink and smoke until my world is bearable enough through my inebriated mind. Recently though even when I’m shitfaced my depressed thoughts find a way in. 

Drunk me laughs easier, smiles easier, truly enjoys what he is doing with a hearty laugh. Sober me feels like I put a mask on when I act happy at work. So I just drink constantly. Work at 4 pm? Taking 14 shots between 9-10:30 and wake up at 3:20. Finish the bottle when I get off. Pass out from that and wake up at 1 am? Open another bottle and drink all night till I wake up and repeat.

I realize it’s horrible for my body but what the fuck does it matter. Not like I’m going to wake up one day and be a social butterfly, attracting friends and relationships. Just going to be a friendless virgin who kills himself eventually, if my body doesn’t give out before that.

I’m sorry for this post, reading it it seems nihilistic, depressed, and edgy. I just have to voice my thoughts",4

We're both in college now but go to different colleges (and didn't go to hs together either, met outside of school). She's been drinking a lot more and more often. This is the first semester she's going to keep alcohol with her all the time instead of going to other people's places to get drunk. 

Both of us know it's unhealthy and both know that she eventually needs to quit. But right now is not the time for me to push anything onto her. 

I'm mostly just looking for advice about how to support her without sounding judgemental. I used to use other drugs, then quit, but have recently started up again, but our reasons for doing drugs were completely different and I probably don't understand what she's going through.

I'm not really sure what the best way to support her would be. Do I avoid commenting on her drinking at all? (She often brings up conversations about alcohol, so not talking about alcohol isn't an option, but should I pretend that she doesn't have a drinking problem, basically?) Should I just ask her how she's doing and how she's handling drinking? 

How would you have wanted someone to handle your alcoholism before you were ready to quit?",1

After some persistent, but minor, lung and chest soreness I dropped down to two 5% abv beers per night as a precaution. I'm young, in my early thirties and otherwise healthy.

There were really no significant withdrawal symptoms until day 4 at two beers, when my HR randomly rose from 75 to 95-115 for about 20 minutes. My head clouded up and felt out of it for about half an hour, maybe some minor confusion and light nausea. Since then, the same has happened once each afternoon on days 5 and 6 (today). Was also probably not eating enough.

My blood pressure was elevated quite a bit when tested on day 2, but has since normalized. BP is slightly higher during the arrythmia, but in the 130s. I haven't had any other serious symptoms.

I have been having some anxiety and paranoia about the pending results of a few medical tests (that have all come back normal or borderline normal), and my thoughts were negative at the onset of the episodes.

I'm approaching 1 week off heavier drinking, and am having concerns. While unpleasant, the episodes don't feel too severe and I'm hoping they are done or nearly done. I had some more strenuous exercise today, so that could be a contributing factor.",1

Basically going through what happened in my old post again.

I should mention I am an everyday alcoholic about 20-30 units a day, been so seven years. Quit smoking 9 months ago,

Not to long after that post I actually had to go to the hospital for appendecitic. Had a ct scan for that. Forgot to ask how the pancreus looked but they didn't say anything about any of my other organs looking abnormal.

I currently cannot get any medical care, my husband is refusing to pay for it. Doesn't seem to care how dangerous this could be.

Went on a bender and felt some pain, just decided to continue drinking through it as I stupidly though maybe that'd get me into the hospital if it got worse at least. Drank for 3-7 days after that, can't remember

Came off bender two days ago.

Numb pain left side below where ribs start to hip, felt like it is going a little bit into abdomen area. Really bad back pain. Mostly lower and left side.

Chest pain, heart area, but I have always got that. It's the side and back pain that are new.

I ate noodles and eggs as soon as I stopped feeling so sick (6am yesterday). Remembered that's a nono if it's pancreatitis so I fasted with just water until I got really hungry and had some rice and a carrot atound 12 am. today 6 am i had more ric

Yesterday at some point I also poked where I thought my pancreus is to see if it's tender and I got a sharp pain in my right side. ribs on that side felt weird for a while but is gone today.

I don't know why I am posting this, I just need to talk abour it I know I need to quit. I know I need to stop failing...",3

This past Monday I woke up with the worst hangover of my life after drinking every day the week prior. I drove to work and had an anxiety attack which lasted all day until I finally went to the ER to make sure I wasn’t going through alcohol withdrawal. The doctor couldn’t say for sure since my vitals were all fine (heart rate, blood pressure, blood work, etc...) but gave me some Valium to calm my nerves for the next few days.

I’ve been feeling great sober all week so far and not having crazy cravings; but I’m planning on going on a camping trip this weekend, and drinking around a campfire just sounds like so much fun. 

Im wondering if, after a short trip to the ER, I’ll be able to get my drinking under control to where I can imbibe responsibly among friends; or if I shouldn’t even go down that road and stay sober for longer.

I don't know if it's that big of a deal.  I am (was?) an everyday drinker to deal with trauma of multiple levels of child abuse and a shitty family.  I didn't start having an issue with alcohol until 2017 when I started remembering the abuse.  In October '18 I attempted to take my life by alcohol and nearly succeeded.  My husband found me and got me to the hospital.  I'm still in therapy and did a partial hospitalization program for 6 weeks in winter '18.  At that time 40 days was the longest I'd gone without alcohol.  I started drinking again (relapsed?) and didn't really know why but I couldn't resist ""just one more"".  That led to two 1.75L per week for most of 2019.  I don't know why I stopped this time.  It had become such a habit that I would make myself a drink at 9am and not think anything of it.  Something changed this past Monday and I can't put my finger on it but when I ran out of vodka I didn't rush out to buy more or have it delivered.

He will at times take a day off every 10 to 12 days but other times it’ll be 2 or 3 months and then one day off. I know he isn’t as bad as he could be but I am trying to encourage him not to let it get worse and mainly because he is a diabetic. I have always heard that giving ultimatums never works, nor does nagging. However I have made it clear at times how unattractive it is and how obnoxious he gets at certain levels. Last week, something happened and I realized he may be more depressed than I realized. I won’t go into details. I didn’t baby him but I made it clear that I believed he’s created his own mess but I loved him and wasn’t leaving over his BS but I told him matter of factly he was going to change and do better and stop drinking so much because I believed it was starting to damage him mentally. I’ve ask him before to stop or slow down but it’s never worked. This week, he went two whole days without drinking!!! First time in years and I’m so proud of him. My question to men who are/were alcoholics, do I acknowledge this and tell him how proud I am of him? I want him to know how great that is but I don’t want him to feel like I’m watching everything he does and discourage him.

My uncle (69) currently lives with my grandfather (92) and serves as his primary caretaker. They are the only two that live in the house, so my grandfather greatly depends on my uncle for bathing, eating, driving anywhere, etc. My uncle has always had a history with alcoholism, but it has grown significantly worse since the COVID lockdown began. Lately, my uncle has had numerous multi-day benders where he becomes severely inebriated and proceeds to get into arguments with my grandfather over past regrets, childhood issues, etc. It is creating a hostile living environment for them both. My uncle is a functional alcoholic so he has been able to successfully care for my grandfather, but we are growing increasingly concerned with the toll this is taking on my 92-year-old grandfather, who is the respected patriarch of our small family. 

We’ve attempted to discuss alcoholism with my uncle while he is sober and he admits that he’s in a deep depression due to lifelong regrets (never getting married, never having kids, not devoting time to his career, etc.) and drinks to cope with it. He has off-handedly mentioned suicide, but backtracks whenever we press him on it. Regardless of the progress we make during these sober conversations, he returns to drinking within hours/days afterward. 

At this point, the only true purpose my uncle has in his life is taking care of my grandfather, but my uncle’s alcoholism is beginning to ruin my grandfather’s quality of life. We are considering removing my grandfather from the house and placing him in a nursing home, but this would humiliate my uncle in front of our entire family and take away the only thing my uncle has to live for. We are afraid of the repercussions of this, but we don’t see any alternative since we can’t seem to unwind his alcoholism.

If anyone with similar experience can please provide some suggestions then it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",1

I'm currently in what is absolutely the worst relapse I've had.. 7 months now of really insane amounts of drinking. I'm reaching a new mental health low, I'm assuming as a result. I've become absolutely delusional.. I quit my job yesterday for an absolutely absurd reason and it's irreparable.

I'm trying to use this moment as an opportunity to move forward. I've already done 7 total inpatient rehabs, and I'm not sure that that's an option at the moment.. I don't have insurance or very much money. However, last time I was in treatment, I was told about sober communities. Essentially large groups of people in recovery that work and live in a community. Maybe this is also a delusion, but I'd really like to believe I'd be more capable of quitting long term if I wasn't only held accountable, but also wasn't around any alcohol.

I've been trying to find more information this morning, but I'm struggling. Does anyone have any information that could be useful? I'm absolutely prepared to move and do virtually any job.

I recently thought about this criterion and asked myself to what extent the loss of control - which is often characterized by the fact that one no longer knows exactly how much he/she was drinking the night before - differs  from the risky, but not necessarily dependent ""binge drinking"" at a party. Isn't it in the inhibitory nature of alcohol that you are tempted to drink more than the recommended amount? Can you imagine the loss of control in a way that you want to stop, but can't because the body demands more and you continue to drink against your will?

Lately my alcohol consumption has been getting out of hand. I’m not the type of person to let things get out of control, but these past few weeks have been, alcohol related, anyway.

Usually I drink a few in a night just to get sleepy (I know thats not the best thing to do) and also makes things a little more exciting when it comes to watching T.V. Or using the phone, whatever it might be. Due to stress, I’ve been drinking a lot more than I usually do, and scared that I’m creating a pattern for myself. I never drink during the day and don’t have any craving for that, but when the night time hits *BAM* it all starts back up. Never used to be like this..

Anyway, long story short, I’m just wondering if anyone has any recommendations or tips to get over this during the night when things tend to be a bit more slow.

SO is 29 we’ve been together 9 years, and he has been very depressed for the past 3 years since his father died. His mother is manipulative, manic depressive, and so many other unsavory things that has done serious damage to SOs mental health. SO had to go to AA meetings for a dui years ago and while he hasn’t gotten behind the wheel drunk since then, aa didn’t have much of a positive affect on him. 
He has a problem with how much he drinks. It’s about a pint and a half to two pints of hard liquor per night. Once he goes over the pint then he turns into mr.hyde.. he’s mean, demeaning, repetitive, and sometimes the things he says just really cut deep.. deep enough to mess with a strong minded persons psyche...within the last couple days I’ve finally had enough and told him about a lot of the shitty things he’s been putting me through and told him that something needs to change. Easier said than done...oh and by the way did I mention his lovely mother was just diagnosed with stage 3 cancer with multiple growths in her lungs treats So like an atm machine and 40yr old sister is a deadbeat. Needless to say SO is on a crazy rollercoaster of emotions. He cares for his mom deeply, but she’s constantly playing mind games. 
So my idea is more along the lines of recording everything and making rules. 
I got a calendar book for him to write in. We set a goal for each week(I was thinking 10 day increments) the first 10 days he has to stick to a pint and write down the price of what he drank. If he goes over the pint limit I was thinking some kind of “punishment” that isn’t extreme, for instance- if he goes over his daily limit then the next day he has to take 1 shot out of his daily allowance and out it on the side.. something along those lines maybe? And then we would taper down the amount he’s allowed daily until it’s such a small enough amount where the goal would be to have a day and eventually days between a drink. I’d love any input. I also thought that it would be good for him to write down daily a small snippet of something positive that happened that day, just for him to see, I’m hoping that will help him with his negative outlook. Wow it felt like I had more figured out before I typed it... if anyone has any advice or input it would greatly be appreciated. I just want to help my guy get on a healthier level mentally, especially since his mom might not be around much longer and I don’t think he’ll be able to handle that in the state he’s in. Thank you in advance.",2

Im only 5'3 100lb woman that would drink nearly a full quart of straight booze to myself in a single night, every day of the week. To the point where i would sneak it to work, have one the second i got up, to when i go to bed. I drank because i was stressed about my unfaithful relationship and had reallly bad anxiety.
The alcohol helped me cope with my stress and anxiety so i began to drink more and more and before i knew it, i realized i had a problem and was in denial about it at the time. I tried to slow down and stop drinking because i gave myself a stomach ulcer. When i tried to slow my drinking, my anxiety got way worse, to the point that i passed out at work and got rushed to the hospital by ambulance. The paramedic said my heart was mimicking a heart attack (it wasnt) but it was because of the liquor.
Towards the end of 2018 i had gotten my drinking under control. Last year i felt great and had no desire to drink. I felt better ect.
Now this year, for most of it so far, i havent drank all that much. These past few weeks i have been drinking more often and it is because of stress and anxiety caused my triggering issues in my relationship. I drank 2 pints in this past week. And i am starting to ""crave"" more of it. I really want to go get more tonight but im worried im in a path of relapsing. Is there any helpful advice for trying not to drink to cope?

During the weeks it's not really bad because he only drinks like 3 of the big cans after work so I guess it's sort of a refreshment. He doesn't really get drink after that many drinks so he's pretty chill and cool but the problem is the weekends. Starting Friday night, Saturday and Sunday he gets really drink and keeps drinking until probably 1/2 am until he gets sleepy and takes himself to sleep. This happens on Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday he might drink until probably 5pm the latest and then he goes to sleep. The problem is that when he's drunk he says a lot of dumb stuff and gets mad really easily but then he forgets why he's mad minutes later and acts like nothing has happened. He doesn't get violent, just very irritable so usually I just say the bare minimum to him and try to ignore him. 

Is there anything I can do make him stop drinking all the time? He tried stopping for New Year's and didn't do too bad (he would only drink like 1 a day compared to 3, which I don't think is too bad because I've read that stopping cold could be bad) but he only managed for about 2 weeks. I know he can stop because he was addicted to cigarettes about 10 years ago and stopped after he needed to go to the hospital for breathing problems. I think cigarettes are more addicting than alcohol so I assume that if he can stop cigarettes then he can stop alcohol too. How can I get him to stop though?",2

I need some help with trying to get my grandmother to realize how much she is drinking and how it affects her. 

She’s in her mid 70’s and to my knowledge drinks every day. I know this because we live with her, which is making it tough because she already knows what we think about her drinking. This is causing her to hide bottles and secretly drink in her bedroom. 

Just a few days ago she bought one of those big bottles of white wine (~50 ounces of white wine) and drank about 2/3 of it that night after we went to bed. The next day I see that she is kind of hungover, even though she doesn’t admit it, and then continues to secretly drink the rest during the day. Then we go out to dinner and she drinks another two glasses of wine and is having a hard time keeping balance when we come back home. 

We’ve each expressed how we felt about her drinking but she justifies it with that my grandmothers parents would stop at nothing to get alcohol (e.g. drinking cooking wine, mouthwash, etc.) and say that she only drinks wine and nothing else so she’s not an alcoholic. 

I suggested that my mom call her doctor and explain what’s going on. My grandmother isn’t being truthful to her own doctor about how much she drinks. Also all of my grandmothers friends drink wine and tell my grandmother that she doesn’t have a problem... it’s really tough because she will listen to them but not her family that she lives with!!

I just don’t know what I can do.

Edit: she also is not eating a lot at all. I feel she might be getting her calories from wine rather than food.",1

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but it does say in the rules to feel welcome if your loved one is struggling with alcohol.

It's 9a.m. on a Friday where I live, and my s.o. is in the next room with his friend, both completely drunk. It's not the first time this happens, it's not even the tenth time this year. 

We've been together 7 years, we're engaged, and I find myself struggling to see any future for us.

He's been drinking a lot ever since we've met. He says he doesn't have a problem because he doesn't drink hard alcohols, just beer. On Fridays, when he gets back from work he opens a beer and keeps drinking until Sunday, when he passes out early and sleeps until Monday morning. On Saturdays and Sundays he wakes up at 6, 7 a.m. and opens a beer. I don't remember a weekend when he was sober. After a lot of tears and arguments he stopped drinking during the week days (Monday through Thursday). I can't tell you how many trips and plans we cancelled. I don't make plans for the weekend for us anymore, since I know he will just get drunk. Last year I convinced him to go hiking with me on the weekends, I thought that would help. He would get drunk on the hikes and I had to drive us back every time.

He says he deserves to unwind, and works hard so he can relax on the weekends. 

It came to a point in which I hardly drink anything at all because I'm afraid that if I have a glass of wine he will see it as approval for drinking. 

Last month his friends and him got drunk and drove our antique, 40 year old car around the parking lot and scratched and dented the car on a trash bin, but none of them remember who was driving. Fortunately nothing happened to any of them or anyone else. I now hide the car keys when he goes out.

Now he has a month off work, and I work from home,  so we decided to redo our bedroom and walk-in closet. It was supposed to take two weeks, it's now week 3 and we're not done, because half the time he's drunk. He wanted to make our bed himself from wood, which he is really great at, but he was having ""just a few"" beers, and he miscalculated, and now the bed is a trapezoid with almost a foot difference on both sides, and when I point it out he gets mad and says I don't appreciate him. The smallest criticism said in the calmest of ways is taken as an attack.

Tomorrow we're going to our best friends wedding, the house is a mess due to the unfinished bedroom, I asked him to finish the bed in the morning, so I can start on the floor (old wooden floor, we're painting it white). Once I start painting the floor he won't be able to enter the room. I told him time and time again I need to be done by the evening, because I need to paint my nails,  iron my dress, and generally prepare for tomorrow. I also need him to be sober tomorrow, and I'm afraid he will do what he always does and go on a binge.

I'm so sorry for rambling, but I feel so helpless and hopeless, I'm in tears, I'm trying to ignore the loud music from the next room, I don't know what to do, I can't go on like this, but I do love him. He says I'm overreacting, that he doesn't have a problem, but I honestly think he does and it's seriously affecting both our lives. He says that if I have a problem with his drinking then I'm free to leave him, and I don't want to, because he is so much more than this, but I'm starting to think that it's either that or life in which I'm always fighting with alcohol for his affection.

I honestly don't know what I want from this post, I think I just needed to tell someone and vent, maybe get your guys perspective. He asked me time and time again not to talk to my friends about this, he says it's his private matter and he doesn't wish to be talked about, and so I don't even know who to talk to.",27

Bit after 5 minutes I need more/. And I’ve tried SO hard to not buy in to it.  But it’s hard.
I feel very unsatisfied with my life, and maybe that’s why I drink?  I honestly don’t know.  I know that I want to stop but I just don’t know how. 
Any advice is appreciated.  ❤️",1

Well, I don't even know if I was one in the first place. My friends called me that as a joke because I could outdrink any of them. I study and practice law in Mexico City so alcohol is always present. I don't know about other countries but in Mexico, lawyers and law students have a reputation of being heavy drinkers. 

I started drinking in high school about once a week and I felt pretty good about it. Over the time, upon starting college, I started noticing that I was drinking two or three times a week but I just assumed that was because I was just meeting a bunch of different people who would invite me to a bunch of different social gatherings. Every time I drank I got drunk, but didn't have any blackouts. I only drank alone like once or twice in my life. August 2019 to March 2020 was my worst period. My law friends and me used to park in the Faculty of Philosophy parking lot everyday where there's no security so we could blast Luis Miguel and drink. We started drinking at 9 or 10 am and we missed a lot of classes. I would drink at least 2.5 liters of beer and about four to five cubas libres. Everyday. Sometimes, at 1 or 2 pm we would maybe go eat something and then continue drinking at my place until 2-3 am. This was on weekdays. During this time I did show up drunk to work at least in 3 different occasions (I only need to go to the office once a week). No one said anything about it but I do think some of my coworkers and even my boss noticed. During this period I also missed a very important exam early in the morning because I was hungover and I would get below average grades when I've always been an all A's student. 

Weekends were when shit went up a notch. I was drinking half a bottle of a 1 liter Bacardi white at the very least on Fridays and Saturdays plus like 4 or 5 beers. Most of the time it was more. Always socially, though most of the time I ended up puking. On Sundays we traditionally have family gatherings and I would mostly have up to 7 beers. I cheated on my girlfriend several times and I've always blamed it on the booze. 

During this period I started considering that I was an alcoholic and that what my friends said about my drinking was true. Most of them do drink but when they're done they're done. They knew when to stop or they just went to sleep. I always found that I wanted to keep drinking even if it was pretty late or everyone was already asleep. Also during this period, what I consider my rock bottom is that one time a friend kicked us out of his apartment because he was getting noise complaints. I had just met a really nice guy that day who is a doctor that lived just three floors below. My friends went home but the doctor said to me that I could stay and drink with him for a while. I wanted to keep drinking. We ended up going on a three day bender with no sleep and before I knew it it was already Monday. 

Now what's curious is that ever since the quarantine started I have only drank like 4 or 5 times. I have felt cravings but no withdrawal symptoms. I have felt a lot better physically but not mentally though. The only time during this quarantine that I've gotten really really really drunk was when my buddies and me went to a friend's house in a small, almost paradise-like small villa (with 0 active covid cases) near Querétaro. I rationalized my excessive drinking because I said to myself that I would not get the chance to get that drunk with my friends in a long while. I ended up so drunk that my friends couldn't wake me up when they needed my help to deal with an aggressive maniac (that's another story). 

That was the last time I drank and it was about a month ago. I still feel guilty because of what my inaction caused. I do not intend to stop drinking completely but I wanna be a regular drinker. I wanna be able to know when to stop. I don't want my drinking to keep interfering with my personal, laboral and academic life. I would absolutely love to hear some feedback.

Edit: the legal drinking age in Mexico is 18.",1

i’m not sure where to start however, i want to seek some guidance or help, or even a better understanding of what’s happening.

my mother was independent, and had no extensive problems with drinking. she would have her glass of wine every friday, after her job and then carry on with her business. she was responsible, and a good mother. however, two years ago she met someone who would soon become her boyfriend. their relationship has been rocky. when things would break off, she would drink, but still it wasn’t too extensively.

now for a year, with an on-and-off relationship, it has gotten worse where if they break up, she would drink extensively. our kitchen, once being filled with only wine, has been stocked with different alcohol to the counter and refrigerator, it’s gotten to the point where she would drink and turn aggressive or depressed. tonight, she wanted to “drink until she passed out” which is concerning because one, i’ve never heard her say that before and two, she has already had a really horrible hangover three days ago. 

i’m barely exposed to all of this, but tonight i’ve made an effort to prevent her from drinking more and i’ve taken all of the alcohol out of the house and put it in my car (it was a lot). i’m not sure how to approach her and this situation, because i’m concerned she’s abusing alcohol (if that’s the correct term). maybe, you guys can help give me insight on what’s going on - maybe it’s just a breakup or worse case scenario, a serious problem. 

thank you so much!",1

I use it as a coping mechanism for my extreme anxiety. I enjoyed how relaxed it made me feel. But it's gotten a lot worse. The current state of the world doesn't help. I've been out of work for months due to an injury and it doesn't look very likely that I'm going back anytime soon. I drink throughout the day. It doesn't seem to make me feel good anymore.

I noticed I would have moments where I feel awful anxiety, like a panic attack, and shake a lot. Sweating a lot at night. I at first thought it was just my anxiety getting worse. But then I made the connection that it must be alcohol related. I confessed to my sister through tears that I think I have a problem. She encouraged me to talk to my dr. I was nervous about that because I had previously lied about my alcohol consumption. But she was very understanding.

I tried to taper off and felt so much better. But I slipped up and I'm back to my normal habits. I hate myself for it. I know I need to stop. I'm killing myself. I feel like I'll be dead within the year if I don't stop.

My dr prescribed something for me to help the cravings go away but I haven't taken it yet. I'm afraid to stop. I don't want to feel all those bad feelings that made me start drinking in the first place. Anyway, thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.",2

I’ll summarize as much as possible. 

Was in a fraternity in college, drank heavily every weekend. Its hard to define because I never kept track, but I could easily drink 12-15 beers and still keep bar hopping.

I graduated college and I drink less. Now that I’m out of college there is no reason to get black out drunk on a Tuesday or a Thursday. However, since COVID, I find myself very bored very often. I work from home so no one notices if I’m hungover, and I still get my job done 100%. 

The reason for this post is for the past 3-4 weeks Ive noticed a pattern of not drinking for 2-3 days, during which I will work out and generally feel a bit better, and then I will cave and drink a good amount (3-8 drinks), feel shitty for a day or two, then the cycle repeats. 

I wonder if this is a coping mechanism for the boredom I feel during COVID or genuine alcoholism. I seriously look forward to drinks, I know it will make me feel better. But the day or two after I am ridden with anxiety, so much so that it impacts my day to day activites. I have a feeling that COVID itself has caused my anxiety to be worse than normal, and I know that alcohol can increase my anxiety yet I drink anyway. 

I am not denying a drinking problem nor am I admitting one. I just want honest opinions and healthy alternatives if possible. The possibility of having a drinking problem has only added to my anxiety problem. Any advice will help.",3

Amount of consumption varied over time. I may be at my highest level of consumption these days but have drank nearly as much in the past. I'm in my mid 20s. Have drank everyday for at least the past 2 months. The months before that it was most days. I drink at least a 6 pack of 16 oz a day, average at least 8. Sometimes starting sipping by noon.

Nobody except maybe the cashier's at local store know I have this problem. I have hid this well from both my family and closest friend. Only my friend knows I've drank often in the past years and they are currently under the impression (due to my lies) that I don't drink often at all anymore. Over past few years the most amount of days I've been sober in a row is probably 5. 

Now I feel I have to stop. Medical needs may require antibiotics, possibly other medications that I absolutely cannot mix alcohol with. In theory I can accept that I have to stop drinking. However I am terrified of the sympthoms I may encounter cutting off. I live alone. Nobody knows I have this problem and I don't want to let them in on it for many reasons that could effect my life that I won't get into. 

I don't know if I can go through this alone. I don't want to have severe side effects and be alone with no assistance. 

If I proceed to stop drinking and keep it all to myself, what should I look for? Has anyone had no side effects but boredom? Do severe side effects come with no other sympthoms? When should I absolutely get medical assistance? I am lost and scared.",3

This  is difficult to write and I apologize if this isn't the right forum for  this. I'm a 24 year old woman and I've had a problem with drinking  since I was 13/14. I have had phases of alcoholism where I couldn't go  without night after night, but have not had too much difficulty pulling  myself out of those phases. What persists is my predilection for getting  blackout drunk. I suspect there's something slightly awry with the way  my body processes alcohol, because I seem to be fine one minute and then  a total liability the next - and I can snap out of it in about an hour  if someone takes the drink off me. When I'm in a blackout state I can't  really speak English - nothing I say comes close to making sense and I  have on many occasions got pretty violent. Lucky I'm small enough that  I've never caused anybody any harm, but I have gotten hurt before when I  was younger and in a particularly vulnerable state. I never have any  memories of what happened really, which I understand is common, but it's  the fact that I make no sense that worries me. Many people have told me  that they've never seen anything like it - and tbh nor have I. I don't  just mean slurring words, I mean stringing words together in a totally  nonsensical manner.

I also get  super horny and inappropriate... coming onto friends and acquaintances  and just generally doing out-of character shit (I'm very shy sober). I  mean I'm not throwing myself at people, but I am incessantly talking  about sex and telling mates when I've wanked over them, which is...  something. The shame is enormous and lasts a good week, I just lie  around crippled with beer fear popping propranolol and wincing when I  get the odd recollection.

These  events are fewer and further between these days, they happen maybe twice  a year now whereas they used to happen every time I had a drink. I fear  I'll just have to give up drink completely as it obviously doesn't  agree with me. I feel like reaching a blackout state is something I have  very little control over - it's just something that happens. I see  other women my size and age drink just as much as me and sure, they get  super drunk, but they just slur their words and maybe start an argument  or fall over. I lose the ability to like... walk or move or speak. Why  tf does this happen to me and why do I feel so completely alone in it?  It's frightening and I'm desperate to talk to somebody who relates",4

So before COVID, I was a social drinker. I NEVER kept alcohol at my apartment.

I'm a PhD student so I'm usually quite busy, but I work in STEM and our labs got shut down for a bit. When that happened, I thought ""why not go to the liquor store?"" I figured I'd be at home for awhile, best keep myself occupied somehow, right?

One bottle of liquor turned into another, and another, and another, and nearly 4 months later, I've been drunk on the daily. Fortunately, it hasn't really interfered with my schoolwork too much, but I can't help but think I have a serious problem now. My father was an alcoholic (he almost died from liver and kidney failure, but somehow manages to only drink a bit of wine each night without getting smashed anymore), so I know it's in my genes.

The problem is that the alcohol keeps me up, fucks my sleep schedule, I can't work during normal hours (not that I'm expected to right now because we have to work in odd shifts in lab to keep our distance), and I find myself justifying drinking every single chance I can.

I feel like I can't even go a single day now without drinking, and I keep telling myself it's okay. I don't know if I really have a problem or it is circumstantial.

Is anyone else in the same boat here?",2

""Hello, this is the sister that has the liver problem and alcoholism. What is the best way to quit safely medically with no insurance? I’m sure my doctor would be happy to prescribe me something that could help. My plan was to quit cold turkey or at least try to tomorrow. I have been drinking for years with few breaks (maybe a day or two here and there)I’m just scared to be honest and figuring out how to handle this; having a liver disease that I’m not 100% sure what it is yet, and tackling the beast that is being a functioning alcoholic which has been a problem for 15+ years. 

I am hoping to go cold turkey. For reference, since this pandemic I have been way over indulging (1 1/2 bottles of wine a night plus some alcoholic beers or seltzer’s beforehand) tonight I went down to a bottle and 2 ciders and was going to try and stop tomorrow. Any advice would be appreciated. This I know is going to be hard. But I have had a wake up call and truly don’t want to die. I need any help I can get and will put in the work I need to.  Thanks for any advice, I’m scared.""",3
2020-07-21 08:22:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hv6eaq/14_day_hump_waking_up_early/,14 day hump - waking up early,"So.. I have been on some sleeping pills. And definitely took slightly more than typical at the start of getting sober. I had some bad withdrawal, and it helped me fall asleep. I think they are beginning to make me more drowsy in the morning, and after work I just want to read my books (a big help in the past 14 days--I no longer zone out in front of a TV for 10+ hours drinking after work now). So I feel the need to taper off of these pills. So I'm slowly going to do that. It's just amazing waking up around 5:30-6am and falling asleep around 10-11. I keep track on my FitBit of my sleep quality--and it's so much better than when I was up until 2am+ every weeknight pounding 12-18 beers, then struggling to wake up around 9 and stay awake during the day. While driving to work with a BAC above the limit... Just from the night before.. Crazy.

So one thing I'm trying to do is take this process extremely sloooowww. Even just waking up and brushing my teeth first thing is a huge accomplishment. I was at the point where I wasn't brushing my teeth for weeks at a time. I'd floss, or brush after a while, and it'd be just blood in the sink. Disgusting. I also eat a healthy breakfast of oatmeal and fruit in the morning. Even just those minor things: sleeping better, brushing my teeth at night and in the morning, eating a good breakfast, reading at night instead of zoning out infront of the TV. Are a huge accomplishment in 2 weeks.

I'm saying this because in the past I have been an, ""all or nothing,"" person. I'd quit drinking, eat healthy and less, focus intensely on my weight, workout, run, cut back to barely vaping, quit TV, hyper focused on cleaning/laundry/hygiene. Dress better. And always, like clockwork, I'd go back to drinking and it would all be wiped out.

My inspiration would always be to get, ""a good body,"" so people would look at me differently. Girls would notice me more. I'd get everything, including my career on track. Life would be perfect, and finally the way I want to live.

So I'm going slow this time around. I don't care if people think it's too slow, but to me it's not. It's much more sustainable I think. I do those things, and focus on my work during the day, not overly, just doing my job. Not slacking and taking naps/ignoring responsibilities because I'm hungover.

I'm 23, have PTSD and I have lots of prior admissions from sucidie attempts, the second they see that on my records they say I must talk to mental health instead. One time I did get a mental health doctor who specialised in addiction and she was willing to give me medication to withdraw safely, but surprise surprise they didn't have any and was told to taper off at home.

I have spoke two to separate GPS, one even laughed when I told him I drink a bottle of vodka a day. The other gave me the number to the local addiction to service.

In the last few months it got pretty out of hand with how often I was taking drink of vodka. I never blacked out during this year and a half but I was constantly taking shots.

I had little breaks every now and then but not substantially enough to prevent neuropathy. 

I started noticing that my foot was tingling after a shot right before going to sleep. I've done some research and have concluded that I may have neuropathy. I want to go to a doctor but no one in my family knows I've been drinking like this in my room throughout the day so I'm keeping it lowkey for now.

In the research I've done theres inconsistency with whether or not its recoverable. I think I caught it pretty early and have pretty much stopped drinking with only having 2 drinks during these past 4 or 5 days, just to help with tightness in my chest (the tightness is gone by now). My left foot has either felt pain or numbness or tingling (mostly tingling) in the past few days. There was a day where I didnt feel any symptoms at all.

I think it was over a year ago where I was two weeks sober..and I'm hoping to beat that this time around.  The first 4 days were awful.  In my many previous attempts, I would hold out until around around 8pm.. then I would convince myself it's not going to make a difference whether I drink or not because I'm going to bed soon anyway.  Plus I have to do this in baby steps anyway.  For the past three years I've been trying to sober up.  One step at a time I'd tell myself.  I don't have to quit cold turkey.  And for the past 3 years I could only dreaming about it every day.  I would google, symptoms of an alcoholic.  And I'd go through the list... and I'd ask myself, am I an alcoholic? Does it matter?  I'm going to work, I'm getting paid, I'm not in debt and it makes me feel happy..  But I wasn't happy. The truth is that people without alcohol problems do not ask Google if they are an alcoholic.  And even after the fifth or sixth time googling this and knowing better... I'd still continue to Google it while shitfaced at the computer.  

I always gave in because after a shitty day at work I needed it.  And every day was a shitty day.  I needed to drink because it's someone's birthday.  Because my girlfriend needed a drink.  Because friends are visiting from out of town.  Because I actually had a good and productive day at work and I deserve it.  Because because because.  It feels nice.  And it is a very pleasant feeling.  But all the while I'm alone in my apartment getting shitfaced on a Saturday morning just because I can.  I would think alcohol gives me control.  It makes me feel better about myself.  I buy shit I don't need on Amazon.  I may text some friends.  But this was only because without alcohol I felt so depressed all the time.  My Prozac wasn't working anymore because I didn't let it.  I am one week sober tonight and I don't need a drink to celebrate that.
There's still so much work to be done. I need to move forward.  I need to focus on what's real and just try harder to not isolate myself in my own gluttony.  I'm hoping and wishing for the best.  And I wish everyone reading this a brand new day tomorrow because you deserve it too.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and support.  It means a lot to me and has given me motivation to continue not drinking during my cravings.

This is going to be kind of long so it mostly a vent that I don't really expect anybody to read. But if you make time to - most appreciated.

I was born in Ireland and lived there for most of my adult life.

Unlike most Irish people I am Jewish. Short explanation: my mom was from the US and moved to Ireland for a gap year program and never left although by the time I was born she had pretty much fully ""assimilated"" lol.

I moved abroad a few years ago. Mostly because I am slightly religious and wanted to marry somebody within my faith and in Ireland, these days, that's almost impossible.

More recently I've had some medical issues. Not connected to my drinking (more in the digestive area). But basically I have to stop drinking as a result of them. If I drink pretty much anything I will get violently sick a few hours later. My dad was an alcoholic by the way (died suddenly when I was 16 ... we don't know if it was connected).

The weird thing is that even though I no longer live in Ireland, I feel this bizarre sense of embarrassment to my friends because I have had to stop drinking (and that hasn't been easy by the way which is why I am posting here in the first place ... I'm 90% there but have had a couple of drinks probably 3 times in the last 6 months). I haven't seen my friends there in about a year because of the pandemic, but I'm dreading going back and not being able to join in a reunion session (or two). And I know there will be peer pressure. Even talking to them on Zoom I find it impossible to tell them about what I'm going through with a straight face.

I still keep in touch with my friends there and consider them closer than most people I know where I live. Growing up sessions are what brought us together so our friendships (and our shared sense of Irishness) are kind of intrinsically embedded with alcohol and 'craic'. Honestly, happy memories and happier than the ones I have made here in this country I moved to to feel more at home. Before my body revolted.

This will sound stupid but having to give up the booze has basically thrown me into some kind of identity crisis.

My Irish identity is much stronger than my Jewish one (I'm proud to be Jewish but don't identify with the culture as much as Irish culture). But I guess I never felt truly accepted as Irish on account of my religion - or I feel like an oddity when people learn that I'm an Irish Jew. Now, as a teetotaler, I feel that dynamic even more so.

Whether you're an atheist, Jamaican, or whatever (because that's clearly not what matters!): has anybody here felt like an imposter of your own cultural identity on account of giving up booze?

Have you found a way to feel comfortable in your own skin again?

I know that this is all ""in my head"" but it's a very real part of the struggle of trying to get to 100% sobriety for me so I thought I would verbalize it.

Thanks for listening.

How do you handle this? I don't really have hobbies. It's way too hot where I live to take up anything outside right now. Something has to replace alcohol though, right?",55

I don’t believe I’m an alcoholic, however my relationship with alcohol is far from healthy.

I rarely drink when I’m not going out, but when I do drink, I’ll drink until I vomit. I’m always up for going out for a beer and if we’re out and about, I’ll always suggest going pub.

2 nights last week I ‘accidentally’ got drunk by myself, which worried me. 
Last night I went to meet up with friends and colleagues for a few ‘quiet ones’ and didn’t get back home until 04:00.

I hate who I become when I binge drink. The loss of inhibition causes me to have reckless & embarrassing cathartic moments, which invariably leave me embarrassed and others alienated.

Since 18 I’ve been binge drinking most weekends. My longest stretch without booze was probably like 3 weeks. I’m too easily tempted. 

I’m taking 3 months off booze, after which I’ll re evaluate my situation, I just need a break. 
I’ve asked my two closest friends (also my colleagues) who I spent 99% of my time with to support me.

The truth is, I don’t like myself when I’m drunk, and I don’t know who I am without booze. I’m excited to shake the former and discover the latter. (Plus I’ve developed an ample bosom over COVID, id like to say goodbye to this too)

2020-07-19 13:49:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hu4mrn/should_we_let_bro_hit_the_bottom/,Should we let bro hit the bottom?,"Brothers been an alcoholic since he was 14. We grew up with a high functioning alcoholic father and my brother unbeknownst to us was drinking his liquor. Alcoholism runs on both side of our family.  
Bros been low functioning since he got kicked out of the marines and he's now 32. Only reason he doesn't have his 3rd dui is because he has a device in his car that he has to blow into to start the ignition. He pays the $100 a month to keep it in there even though he could have it removed because he knows he'll drive drunk otherwise.

My dad started a second company 8 years ago and part of the reason was to keep my brother employed with a job. It's gotten to the point that bro finally ran the company into the ground and my dad walked away from the business and paid off the company credit card debt. He didn't want to shut the business down because he was afraid bro would hate him forever and knows that within the year bro will max out his own credit card with much smaller limit and the business will go under.

Bro's marriage just came to an end after 14 months of marriage. Lots of money was put into it and gifted to him. He squandered it all and wife is taking half. Last nigh I got texts from him saying he was a loser and wanted to kill himself. Said he wished he knew how to tie a good knot so he could hang himself. I already have his gun because he asked me to take it a couple weeks ago.... I went to his house last night hoping I could bring him home with me and help him stay sober today. We also hoped he would go to a detox center. He refused to leave and said he was having a great time playing video games(other addiction of his). I poured out his freshly opened pint and tried to convince him to come home with me. It played out horribly.

My mom and I are trying to convince dad to shut down the business because bro is using it as a crutch to remain drunk everyday. Any other business would have fired him years ago. The business was good at one point but brother ultimately ran it into the ground. They lost all the veterans work they used to get because a customer complained that he was drunk. He doesn't answer customer calls during the day and when he does he's extremely intoxicated even though he's convinced customers can't tell which is a ridiculous notion. We're really hoping dad has the strength to shut everything down so bro can hit the bottom sooner than later.

Mom doesn't think he'll ever change his life and will end up like her brother who lives in a pay by the week motel at age 66. So sad, he's my only sibling and he's an awesome guy when he just smokes weed and stays away from booze, even though most would say his quality of life isn't too good since he just plays video games all day. He's a goofy drunk and has a heart of gold. He's diagnosed with a mild form of autism called nvld which I believe they recently took off the spectrum. When he's sober he's really impressive(extremely personable and articulate which is reason a diagnosis for nvld took so long), but he refuses to stay sober and when the covid lockdown started his life took a nose dive and he's been drunk every single day all day long.

I was going to let him move into a rental property of mine at the end of the month sine he'll be removed from his wife's house(she owned it before marriage and has prenup). I don't want him in my rental anymore because I believe we're enabling his behavior. He told my g/f last night that he was never going to stop drinking and that his family would always bail him out.

Do you guys believe you have to hit bottom to motivate change? I always envisioned my brother becoming homeless eventually and I'd hate to see that happen but maybe it's necessary.",2

Started when I was 24-25 when I couldn’t go a weekend without finishing off a bottle of rum and then it lead to a bottle each for Friday and Saturday along with a couple beers.

Scared me straight when I ended up almost sleeping with some random girl without a condom.

When career aspects were drying up, I went to drinking 6 tall boy beers a day when living at home.  Scared my parents when I was entering this downward spiral.  Ended up crashing my car while out in a bender (dumbest things I’ve done in my life) and had to push it 300m to the garage so as to not alert the neighbours.  Never got charged and my legs were blasted for 5 days straight from the push.

At that point (26m), I got to work on not abusing alcohol.  Lost weight and kept my drinking low during weekends.  I don’t stay up late and don’t get hangovers from drinking.

Fast forward to now (30m).  I kept drinking down to one bottle of rum a week and 8-10 beers.  I am realizing that I don’t like blacking out but enjoy the occasional drink after a long week of work and staying fit.

She said he’s just steadily been getting worse. she knows she has a place to run to but I can’t force her to leave so I feel like I need to have a heart to heart with him. He gets defensive and distant if his family mentions his drinking so I feel like I may be a better person to approach him. He respects me and says I’m the smartest person he knows so I hope he would take my words to heart. I’m an adult child of an alcoholic household so I at least have that perspective.

I’m 22F, 5’8, 127 pounds. I’ve been drinking pretty heavily for the past year. Anywhere from 3-9 shots a night spaced out between 6 hours or so. I know I drink too much, I’m cutting back after this scare. 

Anyway, for the past two days, I’ve been having really light stabbing/aching sensations that last for a few seconds to a few minutes in the following areas (not all at once, location varies):

-mid right rib cage

-middle of my right side

-middle of my left side

-mid right abdomen

-below *left* rib cage

-lower and upper back

-burning occasionally in my back 

This pain is like a 2/10 on the pain scale and lasts for only a moment. 
I had a CBC two months ago and everything came back perfect. 

I have no other symptoms; my pee is clear-yellow, no jaundice, normal stool, no nausea, etc. 

What could this be? Is it my liver? If you have any experience with this, please help.

2020-07-18 21:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/htrwh5/anger_and_alcohol/,Anger and Alcohol,"I'm definitely the type of person that hurts with words and not with physical force (I weigh like 130 lbs and was a philosophy major). I've found that alcohol gives me weird undeserved confidence which helps me cope with the problems I cause in my life (mostly due to substance abuse) but then makes me angry and causes more problems. I feel like my Benzo use/abuse certainly exacerbates the issue whereas smoking weed and stuff eliminates the problem. What's weird is that for example today I was really pissed with my roommate about some bullshit related to cleaning the apartment 
(he honestly didn't do anything wrong I just flip out when people ask/tell me to do things) and I did some speed to muster the ganas (this is what we say in Spanish I guess in English it would be would be like willpower or desire) to take care of that shit but then we ended up just chilling, drinking, smoking and talking about stuff; resolving the issue yet I still haven't cleaned what I'm supposed to. Now we're pretty much all good even though I'm speeding like a formula 1 car and smoking a pint together and discussing things definitely helped but I feel like all the amphetamines really made me less angry and why not (he didn't no any stimulants and I also took 1.5 clonazepam). So obviously a lot could be at play here but I often feel like I'm really ""nice"" when I'm on stimulants whereas I can be a real asshole a lot of the time (obviously not when smoking weed or using real medicine like psilocybin and deemsters). For example I usually drink a fifth plus a bottle or two of wine through the week but during the weekend I either do some moll or have a couple drinks and do a couple of lines of blow and jus blaze all night (maybe do some more blow or x) and when we're clubbing and what not I'm literally considered the ""dad"" who makes sure everyones all good and everything. I'm beginning to wonder whether I'm addicted to stimulants and alcohol together (in addition to my alcohol consumption I usually do a couple lines of speed or blow every day)
but find that hard to believe because I can get a g of white and make that last like three or four nights out no problem whereas my stimulant inclined friends will do an eight ball in a night no problem",4

2020-07-18 16:28:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/htnk5q/my_liver_transplant_journey/,My liver transplant journey,"Hi everyone.  I thought I’d share my story with you.  It’s a journey from a glass of wine to near death and liver and kidney transplantation.

I’m a woman in her mid 40s.  I’ve been employed in a white collar industry most of my adult life, working my way up the ladder without a college education.  I’m told that I’m a trustworthy and good person who puts everyone before myself.  People view me as prim and proper and the type of person you might not swear around, which really isn’t the case once you get to know me.  I guess I’m telling you this so you understand that people don’t usually “get” what has happened to me.

My journey with alcohol began after I divorced in my mid 20s.  I had a child in my teens and married the father.  Not a baby daddy situation (I’m not passing judgement on anyone, just and important part of my own story), we were married for ten years.  Our divorce was complex and I didn’t any support from my family.  It’s a long story, but I was a victim of psychological abuse throughout my childhood.  He ended up with primary placement of our child, though I got to spend time with our child often and we’re very close to this day.

During our separation, before the divorce was final, I moved out on my own for the first time in my life.  Depression had me seek psychiatric attention and I was in therapy for a little while.  I started to feel better after I was on medication for a while and was able to deal with my dysfunctional family issues.  I had started drinking socially, I never had more than a wine cooler maybe once a year before.  I wasn’t allowed to have friends while I was married, so it was nice to get to know people.  So, I’d have a glass of wine now and again.  I switched jobs for a better income.  At that time my new health plan (US) didn’t cover my “pre-existing condition” of depression, so I weaned myself off from the medication.  BIG MISTAKE!  My alcohol consumption went from wine o’clock to vodka and tonic with a lime to eventually just vodka with a splash of tonic.  This was all gradual and I didn’t realize it was happening for a long time.  I had remarried into a family who drinks socially and it was normal to have a regular happy hour before dinner.  I was also adjusting to my new family dynamics.

Eventually I realized that I had a problem.  I was afraid and didn’t know how to get help.  My family now is very religious and conservative.  I am more religious now, but definitely not conservative.  It would be a failure, at least in my mind, to admit a problem and I expected my husband to divorce me if I told him.  He told me on several occasions that alcoholism is just a weak person who couldn’t hold their liquor, not knowing that I was one.  I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Eventually I started feeling ill.  I couldn’t taper down on drinking because I’d get the shakes, so I kept drinking.  I started feeling sick.  My work slipped.  I ended up getting bad bronchitis and went into an urgent care and was prescribed antibiotics.  I didn’t get better and my eyes became very jaundiced.  I got so sick I could barely stand up and walk so I asked my husband to drive me to the ER.  I was soon diagnosed with cirrhosis, pneumonia, and sepsis.  I was really sick, folks.  My husband was extremely angry with me.  He said he knew I was drinking more than I let on, but didn’t think it was that much of a problem.

I was transferred to another larger hospital where they perform transplants.  My pneumonia and sepsis got allot worse.  My lungs collapsed and I was put into a medical coma and on life support.  I stayed that way for well over a month.  I was dying.  My MELD score, the indicator for end stage liver disease, was one of the worse they had seen and they were surprised I hadn’t died already.  The transplant team decided to give me the opportunity to have a liver transplant and agreed to put me on the waiting list.  This is big.  The hospital that I was at only had recently started allowing alcoholics to have a transplant. The only problem was that they couldn’t wean me off from the ventilator enough to perform the surgery.  When they were able to they immediately listed me and I received a new liver the next day.  The way the liver transplant list works is that the sickest person gets the next compatible liver first, unlike other organs like a kidney where you can have dialysis, you can’t live without a liver.  

I had many complications.  I had 12 surgeries in total.  My kidneys decided to fail as a result.  Sometimes your kidneys return their function after a liver transplant, but mine had been through too much.

A little more than a month after my transplant I was transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation floor.  Physical, Occupational and Speech therapies.  I was so deconditioned that I couldn’t even roll on to my side in bed.  I couldn’t sit up on my own.  I spent a month of intense and painful therapy to get to the point that I could sit up in my own and get up to stand at a walker and take a few steps.  I had dialysis three times a week, four hours each session.  I never have felt so exhausted, all while recovering from one of the most major traumas and surgeries that one can have.  I couldn’t eat much on my own.  I’d throw up and have diarrhea.  I had to have a NG tube that I was fed through.  I had gone from 140 lbs, average for my height, to 105 lbs.

After I was discharged I remained on dialysis, I needed a kidney transplant now.  Three days a week and four hours a session still.  Dialysis while recovering was horrible.  I had absolutely no energy.  I wished I had died, really.  It made me feel sick.  I couldn’t eat allot of foods that I liked because my kidney couldn’t filter things like potassium and phosphorus, and dialysis couldn’t either.  You don’t realize how many foods contain one or both of those.  I couldn’t drive, so my husband he to take me and pick me up everywhere.  I had physical therapy at home three times a week and eventually started walking unassisted.  I had lab work done three days a week.  Doctor appointments every week for a while.  Part of the transplant agreement at my hospital was that someone who needs a transplant, and has an addiction, must complete 12 weeks of AODA meetings that is run through the hospital.  Most people are required to do this prior to their respective transplants.  Obviously I couldn’t, so I did when I had recovered enough to go to them.

I received my kidney transplant seven months after my liver transplant.  Fortunately for me there was a new program in place that was a safety net for liver transplant recipients whose kidneys failed and didn’t return to functioning.  Most people in my area wait five years for a kidney transplant. I felt so much better after this transplant.  Kind of like I was watching a movie in black and white an the color just clicked on.

Since my kidney transplant I’ve had numerous complications.  None of them life and death or severe and I’ve not had any episodes of rejection.  I’m very lucky and feel pretty “normal” and “healthy” now.

I now volunteer for the same hospital.  I mentor new liver transplant recipients and liver transplant recipients who are waiting for a kidney transplant.  Mostly people who have issues with alcohol.  

I live with the guilt that I ruined my body, ruined the trust in my relationships and that I took the opportunity of someone else having a transplant earlier, or even dying, because I was too afraid to get help before it was too late.

I hope my journey helps in your decision to seek help if you need it.  Please don’t self medicate with alcohol like I did.  There is help and support out there in many forms.  You just need to take that first step and not be afraid of admitting you have a problem or fear the consequences like I did.  The consequences for me were so close to fatal that it’s almost comical that I was afraid to tell anyone that I had a problem with alcohol.

Take care of yourself and feel free to ask me any questions if you have any.


Edit:  

Thank you for all of your responses, kindness, support and awards.  

I’ve read many of your stories here.  I’ve learned in talking with people and in my own experience, if you think you have a problem you probably do.

Please don’t take drugs, even if they’re “natural” or supplements to help you try to get off from alcohol.  Seek the advice of a professional.  You may damage your body further and our addictive  brains are wired to always want more and more of any “feel good” stuff.

You are strong no matter if you're in your first day, month, year or decade of sobriety, or if you've relapsed.  Keep with it.  You can do this!",105

I encourage him through his situation because his was in a much worse place than me since he drank liquor all day long and I only drank at night. I'd also been ""successfully"" homeless for 3 years, keeping a job almost the entire time and knew the ends and outs of how to survive on the streets in a car. After robbing a gas station because he was absolutely broke, he decided to go to two week detox. 

At that time neither of us had any friends. We became close quickly because parts of our stories were so similar. The biggest difference was our age. He's 45 and I'm almost 30. After getting out of detox he went into a sober living home. He began doing well and we would talk less frequently because he was working again and going to meetings. I was still in me vehicle and he was encouraging through a rough mental time of my own. Eventually, with his influence, I got a hotel room and never looked back. Soon after I get into a hotel, my friend, lets call him Chris, gets kicked from his sober home because they found out that he was taking kratom and on psychedelics and giving them out to the house mates. 

He got kicked out, moved back into his car, and soon after lost his job because immediately went back to heavy liquor upon becoming homeless again. I helped him in every way I could, Mentally, emotionally, and financially and supported him with every resource or skill I've acquired that could help. He really wasn't doing good out there on his own. At a certain point he got the stimulus check and it was gone within a week or so. How I still don't know exactly. After he ran out of money I was sending him money still to help out so he didn't burn alive in the heat and was as comfortable as I could make it for him. Eventually I suggested he could sleep on my couch and I'd help him get on his feet cause I knew all the local resources here. He didn't want to for a while but it wasn't too long before he didn't really have any other choice. 

He made the 1200 mile journey and has been living with me for about 3 months now. I got him a job with one of these gig companies I use as a self employed income. Got him a local medical ""insurance"". His car broke down. Helped him fix it. It breaks again. At this point I start setting boundaries and try to make him take responsibility for himself. He works for a few more days and never gets it fixed, just keeping up with his habits basically. Since he wasn't taking care of his own problems and I had plenty of my own, I told him I was moving to another motel in a week to be on my own. Then he gets sick; respiratory problems, coughing, shakes, fever, vomiting, shits, very weak, inability to eat or keep anything down. 

Take him to the hospital because he thinks he might have covid. I figure its either something to do with the mold around the leaking ac unit or he's been drinking more and then slowed down and it's withdrawl. They won't test him at the hospital for covid cause supposedly they don't have any but they tell him he certainly has it. How they can _tell_ someone they ""certainly have it"" without testing them or giving them treatment is beyond me. Since the hospital he has just been resting, hydrating, and eating what he can. Currently the only issue he has is severe weakness but he's still sleeping most of the day and drinking almost all day when hes awake, mostly on an empty stomach. 

The point in all this background is, he's extremely weak now, is pretty thin, and can barely walk down stairs or drive most of the time. I've spent well over $1000 helping him and am still supporting him through keeping the hotel paid for, giving him cigarettes, and alcohol, although Ive tried to limit it. He drinks malt liquor so if he doesn't have something for a couple hours he is shaking like crazy and starts to get sick. This was already the case before he got here. I'm not sure how much more I can do this though with him. I didn't know things were going to be like this. I'm not even 30 yet and I'm caring for a 45 year old fragile man. Not to mention, I my self have been tapering and am trying to get sober, which makes things difficult the more stress I have. I'm upside down on my bills and basically just staying afloat paying for the hotel. 

At this rate if I keep going this route I'll never get into a more stable home and begin to rebuild my life. On the other hand though, if _I_ do what I need to do for myself, he will likely die. He'll be back on the street in maybe worse condition than he was before minus the liquor. I love this guy. He's my best friend and reminds me of my deceased father in many ways. I don't want to leave him to fend for himself but I don't know what else to do. At any moment something could happen and we'd both be back on the street. He's trying to get into a detox program but they just basically put him on a wait list and have no idea how long it'll take before they let him in. There's a walk-in detox an hour away but there's still no gurantees he'll be able to be admitted immediately. I'd say he could taper himself slowly but he really does not have the self control for that. I'd have to overshadow it the whole time and I'm sure he wouldn't like it. I could just stop buying beer but then he could die. I have gabapentin, naltrexone, kratom, phenibut, clonidine, and trazadone to maybe give him some relief but I'm no doctor. I can self medicate myself through detox because I've done it under the care of a physician before and know how to. I'd never do that for someone else though. 

I'm absolutely at an impasse. He has no family except 2,000 miles away and they wouldn't take him anyways if he or I tried. I really don't know what to do. I have friends telling me to just take care of myself and let him be responsible for his own actions. If he dies though, I'm not sure I could live with having that on my conscience. On the other hand, I really don't see this situation getting much better anytime soon.

Please someone anyone with some advice, I'd really really really appreciate it. I'm desperately trying to find the right solution and I've been unable to come up with one yet. One where I still take care of myself but don't essentially kill my good friend by leaving him to die.",4

They know know that I want to help them hence them telling me so. They're terrified they're going to lose their child in a custody dispute if it gets out that it's this bad. Maybe I'm being optimistic but this is where I seek advice:

* The current living situation for my friend/SO is toxic. They're living with another alcoholic, this one currently has had repeated trips to the hospital this year for alcohol related organ damage. This other roommate will flip and lash out at my friend causing emotional turmoil and will raid their room for any alcohol. 

* My friend/SO has stated around me, around my family is a totally different feeling of calm, of stability and I want to place an offer but don't want to seem overbearing. Like give it a one week window to start at my place, try to focus on themselves, on trying to wean off and get a sober mind state around people who are supportive. If they need to stay longer they are more than welcome, but they are away from the primary toxic environment/enabler. Does this sound unrealistic? 
*  They've stated they wish to go to rehab for it and I am completely and totally willing to support. In fact if you all have any true advice for someone who wants to support and help someone recover by all means I'd love to learn. 

I appreciate any and all advice you could give me. Before you might ask why I'm willing to dive into something like this, for me it's rather simple; I fell in love with the person they are, the person I know is below all of this. She's fought the demons back and was stable but some recent events knocked her back hard. She's fighting it all and with the current housing I think it's enabling her. I want to help give her a fighting chance back to being the amazing person she truly can be.",2

I bought some Kudzu Root supplements after doing some research about Kudzu root studies and reading reviews on Amazon of customers who bought it for that reason. I believed it's probably too good to be true, but verified reviewers are verified reviewers. So I bought some a few weeks ago to test it out and see if they are placebos.

I have been an almost everyday drinker and even more on the weekends. I always had the urge to drink after 6pm. Usually, I would succumb to go grab a six-pack of white claws by like 9 or 10. It was getting pretty worrying to me that I was drinking this much every day.

I started taking the supplement Monday through Friday 2 weeks ago (I still wanted to drink during the weekends, just control my weekday drinking). It's like magic, that nagging alcohol desire has vanished. As soon as I start feeling that trigger around 6-7pm, I take one of the supplements and within 20-30 minutes, I am like a whole new person without potential alcoholism. I have felt like I won a jackpot of money for finding this.

If you are struggling with alcohol addiction/cravings, please give this magical root a try.

Here a study for binge drinking, but I would suggest searching ""kudzu root alcohol"" on google or going to amazon and reading reviews for kudzu supplements.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510012/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510012/) (apparently it helps with binge drinking as well, I don't notice it helping me in binge drinking but rather in abstaining on the days I don't want to drink. My girlfriend says she notices I actually do drink less when I took the Kudzu root on a weekend).

If you decide to try it, let me know how it goes in a week or two. I really hope it helps YOU. :)",4

My mother passed away before my very eyes. I was the one who performed CPR on her before the ambulance showed up. My father all but abandoned me again (he abandoned us after the divorce but came back for a little while later) after I came out as trans. No one in my family talks to me anymore except for my little brother. All I have is this couple who treated me like family for the first time in over two years.

I fucked up countless times, and eventually had to be admitted to psych three times before a doctor decided I was an alcoholic and needed to either cut back or (preferably) stop drinking entirely. I stopped drinking because I needed to for the people I am living with. It hurt them. I hurt them. I’ve slipped up a few times. I have gotten drunk twice in the last 5 months since. And last Sunday I drank two beers with another old friend. My roommates found out and since then one of them hasn’t spoken a single word to me. He won’t even look at me. I didn’t understand that sobriety meant no drinking at all. I thought it meant that I shouldn’t get drunk anymore. I’ve tried explaining and apologizing. I have tried to show I’m serious about being sober. I’ve been reaching out to support groups, online AA links, the such. Nothing has broken this silence. And I’m not doing these things for face value. I seriously need the support. I’m learning a lot about my misconceptions about sobriety.

I fear I’ve placed the final straw that has broken the camel’s back. I know I’m supposed to aim to be sober for myself, and that I should be my reason to be better. But the truth is I don’t give a single fuck about myself. I really couldn’t care less if it was just me. Hell, if I was thrown out on my own I’d go back to drinking in a split second. It’d probably result in another suicide attempt that’d most likely work, but I’m okay with that. I’ve made peace with the fact that that’s how much I’m worth. My reason to keep being sober are these two amazing people who have shown me a world beyond just my binge drinking. I love living it with my closest friends. But without them, I don’t see much of a point in doing this anymore. If they won’t even talk to me or look at me, what can I even do?

You would think his drinking would make me want to stop...it only escalated. My brother was the only one who could...wanted to stop. My mom doesn't drink at all...a glass of wine once in a blue moon is it.

2020-07-15 17:20:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hrwdkt/my_husband_and_alcohol/,My husband and alcohol,"Before I married my husband I knew him at uni. Our group of friends knew he had a alcohol problem. When I started dating him, he would get drunk all the time. I managed to kurb his drinking a little. It got to a point that I wanted out as I was pregnant and left him as he had cheated on me too.

Years later he wanted to see our oldest child and we rekindled our relationship. 12 months in he started drinking heavy just after we married.

For years he would drink and drink. I drank with him as I didn't know what else to do. I realised it was a problem when half the rubbish was beer cans. I stopped and he stopped briefly.

He works away a lot and when he does he gets drunk. I can't stand to speak to him when he is like that.

Today his dad passed away. His father lives 100 miles away and we raced to go down and be with his mum. Within 30 minutes of getting here, his brother offered him a beer.

His brother was already inebriated.

It's now evening, our 3 children are upset about there granddad and he's sat drinking anything he can lay his hands on.

I feel so bad because I wanted to come down to support him. I had no idea he was desparate to get down here to get drunk. I have sat for most of the day watching his brother get wasted and then my husband.

To top it off I feel alone. I am having my own problems that recently surfaced and was getting tests sorted for possible cancer of the cervix. I have binned them off to support my husband and it doesn't feel he needs the support. I feel like he would rather be here alone and get drunk.

I desperately want to leave in the morning and go back home with our kids. I don't want to see my husband getting drunk all day. I don't want my kids to think when you have a problem drinking is the answer. I feel really guilty for feeling this way.",2

My husband is an amazing man, truly. He loves me and my family and supports me in anything I want to do in life. He’s already an incredible dad to our little man, who is making his debut later this year. What was a rant post about me talking about how annoying his beer/wine habit is while I’m going through this pregnancy turned into folks telling me his consumption and actions are not okay. My husband comes from a family of beer drinkers - that’s what he always tells me. They all drink beer like it was water. Problem is, my husband drinks one, then another, then another, and doesn’t usually stop until he passes out asleep wherever he’s sitting. Could be at a table, could be on the couch, or sitting around a campfire. He can have three or four beers and fall asleep. A few glasses of wine - falls asleep. If it was just a problem of him not being able to HANDLE his alcohol, then maybe I could talk to him about it...but my issue is that he just doesn’t seem to know when to stop once he’s started. He’ll have an entire bottle of wine (those big boys, not the normal sized) and then decide he needs more, or some beer, and get some from the store. He’ll fall asleep mid drinking, wake up a few hours later, keep drinking whatever it is he already had poured. He’ll drink a six pack, then decide a bottle of wine would top it off nicely or another six pack will do it, and go get another. It’s frustrating. I love this man and he is incredible, but I would love to have a sober husband to spend time with. Now, he doesn’t do it everyday. The nights before a work day? Won’t drink, or he’ll have one glass or one beer. The nights before a day off? Anything goes. I have tried talking to him about his drinking in the past, but he does get annoyed with me since he thinks I’m projecting my own father’s alcoholism onto him. Guys, it’s just frustrating. I want to have a husband who can either handle his damn alcohol when he has a few, or one who doesn’t do it in excess at all. I don’t really know what I’m looking for here...maybe some validation that just because he may have a drinking problem, it doesn’t mean he’s an awful person. Maybe I just want someone to tell me how to talk to him or approach the subject? I’m not sure...but I really hate the judgment you face when you bring up even the slightest hint of your spouse having an issue. 

Thank you for reading my rambling post. I hope someone can give me some sort of insight.",3

To summarize the situation as much as possible I'll just say that my husband and I have recently encountered some marital issues which mainly seem to stem from his claim to have fallen out of love with me.

I fully acknowledge that couples *can* grow apart. People change over the course of 14 years. However, this declaration caught me by surprise - especially since he says he has not loved me for *years* now. Our marriage was not perfect. I won't deny it needed work, but as I look back now at our relationship with a closer, harsher eye our decline seems to suspiciously align with his increase in drinking habits and depressed behavior. Behavior and habits that I made excuses for and denied to myself.

Has anyone else had an alcoholic partner say they no longer love them, only to find that their love was actually still there but drowned out by alcohol? As an alcoholic, have you ever lost passion, desire, or excitement for a partner only to rediscover it after becoming sober?

The last eight months of our relationship have inflicted more emotional damage than I ever thought possible, but as my husband is finally showing a desire to change his relationship with alcohol I'm torn between self-preservation and the hope that we can recover together.",15

I still (like say 1:00 on July 15th) have the Pavlovian reaction (I want to drink) when I get the inevitable, “want to feel different now”

Fortunately now (almost 3 years no drink) it never gets to the consideration phase to drink (Though consideration was dependent origination of drink). The frequency and intensity of these feeling thankfully though decrease month over month.

(Now) I see drink as a short term fix, that no doubt would work short term. But (if drink) the problems will come back stronger with the multiplier alcohol provides.

I have gone 30 days without drinking, thinking it was something I wasn't going to do ever again. I felt great, my mind has become more clear, and I have become a lot more optimistic. Tonight, anxiety got the best of me, there is a lot of toxicity in my home, my mother is upset and everything was pissing her off, and my girlfriend isn't in the greatest of moods either. My mom has been sarcastic with her all day, mainly over dishes she didn't wash, and the fact she's been out of work for the last few weeks do to her vertigo and headaches. She implied that moving in was a mistake at this point of time (My mom, brother, girlfriend and I moved into a new apartment just 2 months ago.) and my girlfriend didn't take it lightly. My girlfriend has bipolar, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, so when things upset her, they REALLY upset her. With the 2 of them being in bad moods, it's like it transpired to me, and I was having anxiety all day, so I did what I remembered helped my anxiety, drank alcohol. Now, I drank every night for 3 years up until June 14th of this year (It helped me fall asleep and relieved anxiety and depression, or so I thought...), and I stopped because I had a bad conscience about it, and knew it wasn't good for my health. The fact that I can go back to it this easily after 30 days of not having it, makes me think there is no hope left for me, and I will always be an alcoholic. Is this true?

I'm moving into my parents next week where I won't be able to do any drinking. My parents do know about my drinking, they said they can't force me to stop drinking, and the will support me in trying to stop.

He was meant to take it with him yesterday, but he forgot luckily.        

I have complained about this with our mutual friend, who also knows and is worried about my drinking. He is on my exes side here.

I am now back at that stage.

I recently moved in with with girlfriend and her mum about 4 weeks ago and I have been drinking every single night since then. At least 3 largers and other nights I'm drinking spirts along with the lager. Some nights I get socially tipsy after a couple and go to bed, but there has been nights where I have got blackout drunk and vomited in the toilet, I wake up the next morning with no idea what's happened. I've been cutting down on the drinking now and tonight to have none and just have a non alcoholic beer but I'm worried about how bad the withdrawals are going to be. Also, with health anxiety has flared up again and now I'm convinced I have liver disease, despite having a blood test a month ago (for an unrelated issue) and everything was perfect, kidneys and liver included. So, perhaps it's just the anxiety because it's probably unrealistic that I've developed liver disease within a month.

The funny thing is, I only WANT to drink when I am around people who are drinking but somehow still end up cracking the first beer around 6 or 7 every night when I am alone, and after #2 or 3 there is no stopping till I go to bed. After drink 2 or 3 I get the euphoria and even get very productive on things that matter (work, cleaning, money management ideas, and others). After #6 or 7 though it is like my body is on cruise control going from an empty can to a full one. Just writing this out makes me want a beer. 

It isn’t something I think about all day and can absolutely not drink if I have a good reason not to (will be driving later, or around people who don’t like drinking etc), but I still can’t figure out why I still DO drink when I have no reason to. It isn’t really a craving or an urge, but more of a “why not” thing every single night I chose to drink. 

I go back and forth if this is a problem or not, but need someone to tell me flat out it is or isn’t. There have been a handful of times in the past where someone will comment on the vast amount I am able to drink in a sitting but nobody telling me “you have a problem, man.”

This is a throwaway account since my regular account is semi-shared with my GF on our living room computer. I am really struggling to get sober since the withdrawals are quite taxing on me, but the authorities suspend your drivers license if you seek professional help, and I really need it in the future for when I actually get sober, so it's not an option right now. My GF has a reduced sense of smell, and works at 06:00 in the morning, so me going to bed way after her is normal. I never touch her liquor, so as far as I know from my probing, she thinks I'm a heavy sleeper. The drinking is also fairly new, so she thinks I'm just up gaming when I drink.

&#x200B;

I grew up in a small town where early debuts for drinking where both accepted and almost encouraged. At 14, after your confirmation, your parents would send you to parties with some alcohol, because it was part of ""growing up"". This gave me a really unhealthy drinking pattern: You drink until there is nothing left, and getting black out drunk was so normal that you would have to fuck up majorly for anyone to take notice of it. This continued in to my twenties, and became somewhat of a problem when I entered university, and caused me to not be invited to parties in several of my social circles since I always got way more drunk than regular people thought was fun.

&#x200B;

I realised this was a problem, and started drinking light-beer (2,2%) to try to adjust to a more normal way of social drinking, but some of the social damage was allready done, and I noticed that I didn't really enjoy hanging out at parties without being wasted. Around this time I also dropped out, since I struggled with what I later learned was severe depression. In the beginning it was fine. I had a few years of work behind me before going in to Uni, and I returned there for a while. Problem was that i was back as a temp, and they didn't have the hours for me to work any more than for me to pay my rent and some basics. No money left at the end of the month for anything like savings. I started drinking alone, since it calmed my head.

&#x200B;

After a few years of periodic drinking to be able to sleep, I woke up suicidal one morning. I got help, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When I got proper therapy, and after a while medication, I stopped drinking for 3 months straight, and when I started drinking again, it was only in social settings. I got a job working as a professional driver, transporting goods, so alcohol was out of the question for me anyway, and I didn't really think about it either. Point of this last part is: I don't have the urge to drink when I can't. I never touched even a single beer as long as I had the keys to the company vehicle on my person.

&#x200B;

This was 5 years ago. I went back to uni, and finished my degree last fall. With a botched resumé, it turned out to be harder to find a relevant job for me, so I went back to the transport company who offered me enough hours to make by, and also pay some older debt I got when I was really down and fucked up.

Come Covid-19, and they can't offer me any more work for a while. They are just now back to hiring their full time drivers back, and I'm in the back of the line. I get enough social security to get by, like I was a few years ago, but my age and current situation is really hellish. Since the start of may, i've been drinking almost every day. There has been a day or two in between, but that's only when I have had to be somewhere the next morning. Never really missed an appointment, and I've been through a few job interviews that I was sober a day in advance for, but as soon as I don't have to do anything in the morning, I drink. I didn't crave it, but it calms my head, so I know I will feel better after a few pints.

&#x200B;

Problem now is that starting last week, I actually have to be somewhere in the mornings. Not for paid work, but for social activities with friends, and they are really important for my mental health. The problem now is, when I get sober, I start to sweat like a maniac, and if I take my sleeping meds to get past the first day of not drinking, It feels like I have a fever. I had to drink a beer at 11:00 today to stop my hands from shaking and myself from sweating out my t-shirt. This has been a routine the last week when I've tried to stop. It usually ends with me drinking a lot more just so I'm sure I can make it through the night okay. I just hope I make it to bed tonight without the withdrawals being to heavy to fall asleep.

Please ask if you want to know more details.

I have no clue what to do now...",3

Just wondering if anyone here experiences the same thing.," A sort of duplicate post. I posted this in the r/alcoholicsanonymous sub as well. I just want to reach as many people as I can for some answers.

Hi there! In start, forgive my bad English. I'm from Ukraine.

I am a month sober today. It's been difficult. I was wondering if anyone feels like they have to get their personality back as soon as they are sober for awhile? Being on alcohol allowed me to do anything I wanted. I could socialize, feel confident, survive on empty (no food). I also had (and still have) hallucinations which trouble me quite frequently. Well, they went away whenever I drank. I would feel happy, at peace, bright and bubbly. I could laugh when something was funny. I could cry when something was sad. I felt like I had a purpose. I even went to work after one beer (1pt at the most) and worked faster than I ever did. I didn't let my paranoia bother me either. It was nice. I feel like I was a better partner to my boyfriend. I didn't have so many negative emotions. I didn't drink to get away from my problems like much people do, I drank in order to be able to focus and work through them.

Now since being sober, I feel completely blank; like I have to start from the ground up. I don't even know who I am now. I have no emotions at all. Some days I break down in tears because I'm constantly thinking about just having a drink to ease myself through the day and the monotony of life. However, I recently got an apartment with my partner and have bills and such, so I know the wallet can't take it. I connect such thoughts in my head like, ""I just spent $10 at McDonald's. I could have used that money to get a drink instead, which would benefit me longer.""

I don't know how much more of this I can take. I really want to cave in to my desires and just go off the deep end into this addiction. I don't want to be here anymore, not just because of the drinking but other reasons as well.

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever felt like this and how they got through it. I'm sorry for rambling. I really needed to get it out of my chest, so it has no real structure to the post. Just writing from the top of my head.",2
2020-07-13 16:10:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hqmqtc/excessive_sweating_even_after_most_moderate/,Excessive sweating even after most moderate withdrawals go away.,"For example if I had a few 2-3 day binges followed by 3-5 days of no drinking by night 2-3 my sleep is better and I sweat less at night with the temp at 68-72. But getting up and going in the morning even with no hangover or any type of stress or anxiety in the day I’m sweating buckets especially with any caffeine. I noticed this goes away a week or 2 weeks of no drinking but why is this?  Strenuous workouts also tend to help it go away quicker. It’s like the body needs to sweat out a lot more or something. It’s really annoying. No shakes or other withdrawal(very minor if so)  just sweating. 

This started in my late 20s now 32. About to take a long break from weekend binging it’s just not worth it anymore.

It’s like any minor workout even walking to get the mail I’ll sweat a lot more than normal. Anything that raises your heart rate etc.",2

2020-07-13 11:35:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hqhetg/i_really_hate_drinking/,I really hate drinking,"I hated drinking so much, I didn't even like it when I was younger. (I'm 22 so that'd be when I was underage and drinking... Lol.)

I chose to drink when I was feeling down and was alone. But it never tasted good so I only had a small glass of rum and coke. I stopped and could barely finish it.

One night I was just too tired and anxious (I have anxiety and depression so I'm always tired and anxious) and I decided to drink more. And more. Until it started to taste really good. Then I didn't want to stop. I thought it helped my anxiety, that I was ""more fun"" when I was drinking heavily by myself. But when I looked at some of what I was sending people, I was so embarrassed and humiliated. 

Guess what that caused me to do? Drink more the next day. I really felt like shit and wanted to forget. But it didn't work because I still remembered and I got really depressed. Drinking on my antidepressants made me feel even worse than usual so I tried cutting myself to feel anything. I still didn't feel it. I clawed at my arm. Still nothing. 

I put the bottle in the trash and tried to laugh it off the next day. That day is when I went to the psych ward because when I was drinking, I really wanted to kill myself. I've never had it be that strong before, the urge kept getting stronger and stronger. And I was scared. 

I hate asking for help so much. I don't like telling anyone my problems. Everybody was worried about me and I didn't tell most of them it was because of drinking. 

I hate the label 'alcoholic' because as someone who hadn't really drank much before, I didn't feel like it fit me but during that period of time (even after the hospital, I still drank for a few weeks like that and passed out for the rest of each day after my morning drinks), it definitely fits. 

My sober friend who has struggled for so much longer than me even told me I had a problem that I was out of control. It really scared me. That's the one thing that made me want to stop.

I still haven't stopped fully but I'm working with a therapist so I can try to take control of it. I don't want to be scared of drinking because when I'm not alone drinking I feel safe with friends. I don't want to be scared of certain drinks that I love (tequila, rum, whiskey) and the situations they may bring. 

I never thought I'd face this problem at 22 (almost 23) but I want to tackle it now. I feel better sober and on stronger meds than I did before. I don't want to drink until I blackout anymore and I want to lose this ""beer belly"" I've had for months. I've lost 10 pounds so far but I want to keep going. I'm done and I want to be in control.",19

I’m gonna make a long story short. In October 2017, I became pregnant with a man I was in love with but I knew he wasn’t very good for me. We kept it and during my pregnancy I had a lot of health complications. Then when I was 6 months pregnant, my mom (my best friend) hung herself. No one saw it coming. Fast forward to giving birth, I had to be induced 3 weeks early due to extreme high blood pressure. Once she came, I had instant postpartum depression. I MEAN INSTANT! They laid her on my chest and I went into a panic attack. I didn’t want her and I didn’t know how the hell I was going to take care of her. I suffered extreme postpartum depression and my boyfriend started cheating on me because it was “all too much”. Things started to get better after about a year. (I now love my daughter more than anything I could ever explain and realize she saved my life after my moms passing. She is my WORLD!) but things got bad with her dad, physical and mental abuse, and a LOT of cheating. So in March 2020, I finally left him in the middle of the night. I now live with my sister, her husband and her 2 kids and I just can’t seem to stop drinking every single night. It seems like the only way I can cope with my issues and stress and depression and anxiety. I have drank wine every night for the past 6 months. (4 glasses, when she’s with her dad, usually 6.) i never black out but I DO drink every night. I am 26 years old....I got it in my head that if I stop I will have a seizure which scared the crap out of me. And now I just can’t stop. I’m really afraid I have become an alcoholic. I want to slow way down... but I don’t know how.",9

My entire life, my mom has been my rock. There is nobody on this planet that can give me comfort the way she can, and the day she dies will be the worst day of my life. She has always been the perfect mother, she is a nurse and has three children. Anytime I would get hurt as a child, physically or mentally, she always knew exactly what to say/do. I am 19 now and still find myself crying in her arms every now and then when my depression gets really bad. 

The past year or so, life has not been very kind to my mother. She got promoted which sounded fantastic at the time, however it has increased the stress in her life by 5000%. The stress of the job was already bad enough, then COVID-19 hit which only added fuel to the fire. I don't blame her for turning to booze, addiction runs in the family. I smoke weed most nights for similar reasons.  

For a few months, I've made the mistake of just watching. I assumed that she would be able to conquer her addiction on her own, she is the strongest woman in my life after all. She has overcome all sorts of trauma and stress from her childhood well into her adult life. While at one point it seemed as though it was getting better, of course the booze made it into her life again. 

I think she always thought that she was hiding it from us very well, but I've known pretty much the entire time. It has gotten to the point where I can tell if shes had one drink or five just based on her behavior alone. Today I finally decided that I should be there for her, something that I have been putting aside for far too long. 

I told her that I was worried about her, but that I love her no matter what. I wanted to make sure that she didn't feel as though she was hurting me in any way. I could immediately tell that she was flabbergasted that I've known, and the first thing she said back to me was ""I'm sorry"". 

That. Fucking. Hurt. 

My mom is such a kind and loving woman, so of course her first response was to think about me. I used every ounce of strength I had to hold back tears and gave her a hug, but immediately after the conversation was over I broke down in the bathroom. I don't want my mom to think she is a bad mother, but I'm scared that I've put that thought into her head. All i want her to know is that I'm worried about her and will be there for her no matter what. I'm not sure if I communicated that message properly. 

This just fucking sucks man. Fuck booze, fuck what it does to people. I want my mom to get better, but I don't want her conscience to be weighing her down. 

When I told my brother that I talked to my mom, he seemed pissed. He said that ""Shes only been drunk from like Friday to Sunday lately anyway"". This is complete bullshit as I know that he is equally as worried about her as I am but he never had it in him to talk to her about it. 

Anyway, the short of it is that I think I made the right choice, but now I feel terrible. I don't really know where to go from here other than showing my mom love and support whenever I can. I have ADHD so its difficult for me to remember to check in on people, but I'm going to do my best to be the son that she needs right now.",12

I thought all it did was make my face turn tomato red (I can deal with that). I took 2 shots this time because my drunk best friend next to me was saying she wants to be done with our friendship. I have no idea how to write this as I am going. My brain feels like a leg that fell asleep when you’re trying to stand up worse than ever because of those two shots... I was ok, I drove home fine. 2 shots never seems like a lot to me when i wasn’t on this pill. I couldn’t sleep all last night and when I took my medications this morning it quickly got worse. Breathing is uneasy. My headache goes from the front of my head to where I’d imagine my brain meets my spinal cord. My vision is blurred. I feel like I’m constantly raising my eyebrows but if I I look in the mirror I’m not. My head is numb and can barely feel if it’s being touched.

I do make his life crazy. I’m pretty sick and tired of me too. I really hope someone has some better insight for me about this medicine that they may of overcome. I don’t ever want to take Antabuse again and hope I will be strong enough to stay away from drinking anyways... because I don’t feel good.

I was rushed to the ER where I was found to have had an anoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen to the brain due to all the alcohol. My kidneys were also incredibly damaged in the incident. 

From August 2019 until New Years 2020 I was hospitalized in a nursing home where I recovered and underwent dialysis for my kidneys, and speech and occupational therapy for my brain injury. Since my release from the nursing home I've been living in a supervised group home specifically for people with brain injuries. Alcohol nearly took my life. 

It's been nearly a year since my brain injury and I'm set to be released from the group home in a couple weeks.

Sure, I would have some benders every now and again, and it would be reflected in my performance/life/hygiene/appearances. But it seemed I really got the alcoholism motor running over the past 4 years. It's been a steady ride down the shitty path of alcoholism. Showering became less of a daily thing, more of a meh, it's been a few days, guess I'll take one. Shaving? hahahahaha. The 5 o'clock shadow is in, and I can get away with it being 4-5 days before anyone reallllly notices right? Sure. Brushing my teeth and other hygiene just totally disregarded.

I'm on day 4 and I feel like I'm still stuck in the rut of those effects. I'm getting a little testy about things at work, which surprise, given the current status of the world, is shaky. I know I need to start showering, brushing my teeth, clipping my toe nails, having a routine again. Or having one. And keeping it. Letting things slide now and again, like sleeping in, vegging out, but not being a depressed sop like I have been while drinking. I just feel stuck in this rut, and little things that have been said by friends and co-workers recently are getting on my nerves more so. I guess i'm just being testy without the alcohol there. My anxiety is elevated. Haven't talked to my psych in a while, I should probably do that. At least tele-health or something. 

Man.... I can blame this on staying indoors and working from home. But that isn't to blame for this. I was doing this before working from home. It's just it got worse because of it.

i feel so distant towards her. when she’s sober we’re really close. i end up becoming the mom (cooking, cleaning, washing, etc) and it’s like i have to put a front on in order for me to be able to cope with it all. i try to tell myself that it could be worse and that i should be greatful that it’s not. but i still feel so hurt. i know this might make me sound cold hearted, but i don’t care about her anymore. if she hurts herself, or is crying i feel so empathy towards her, no emotions at all.

Anyone else feel the same? I used to feel that alcohol pleasure you feel after your 3rd drink/beer but now i don't. I used to chase it everyday i longed for it but now i dont. It was the the main point of my nights when drinking. Nowadays i don't drink nearly as much as i did before because of the fact i no longer feel that pleasuring effect i longed for, which makes me depressed...

Can anyone out there relate? I didn't even drink that much, like 2 nights of binge drinking a week for 3 years.",2

I was typically clearing 1.75L of vodka every two days. I feel lucky; my withdrawal basically consisted of flu-like symptoms for a few days, very mild hallucinations, insomnia, intense dreams/nightmares (when I did sleep), waking up speaking out loud to an empty room. I was fine for a few days after that, but then developed some pretty severe hives on my lower legs. From what I understand these are stress-induced from the whole detox process. 

I avoided the grocery store until yesterday, because even passing by the liquor aisle has always been a trigger for me. I was fine this time, although I think I noticed every single bottle of alcohol in everyone else’s cart. 

No real point to this post, I just wanted to share and wish everyone else good luck and good health, whether you’re still drinking, thinking about quitting, or recovering.",15

I’m pretty sure this is alcohol-related, because if I stop drinking for four days, it goes away, but then I have a minimum of one mug of white wine, and it comes back.

I get this pain in the center of my chest. It feels like pressure. At its worst, i can feel slight pain if I tap hard right in the middle of my chest. If I’m in one position for a while, like lying on my side propping up my head with my hand, changing positions will be painful. Coughing can be painful if I don’t slouch, and if I stretch my spine out and puff my chest out, I can actually feel the sensation of something ‘slipping’ in my chest.

I know I should just go to a doctor, but has anyone else ever experienced something similar?",3

No other withdrawal symptoms than that. I just am absolutely ashamed that I’ve let myself get to this point. Embarrassed. I have been drinking responsibly since about 19 years old, (27 now) maybe once every couple weeks, only on the weekends. but in the last two months I have been bored/lonely/depressed and isolated in quarantine and as a result began drinking pretty regularly every night. Again usually responsibly, one or two drinks to calm my nerves but then some nights I’ve foolishly drank to the point of blacking out. Out of ~45 days or so of moderately drinking, id say about 12 of them have been irresponsibly binging. I firmly believe I don’t need medical attention, tho some maybe probably disagree and I really do respect your concerns. I have already begun weening myself off, like I’ll let the subtle trembling go on until I have to work (writing and drawing for a living) and I’ll have a small drink in the afternoon and be okay for about 15-20 hours until it starts again. I legitimately want to quit drinking, and I have no health insurance so rehab isn’t really an option; I have two dogs and no one to take care of them. I want to eventually stop drinking all together as soon as possible, and I would just like to remain physically comfortable and functional as possible until I do. I just wanted to see if someone has any kind words of encouragement or personal experience they’d like to share? Maybe a recommended plan or something? Again I’m not asking for medical advice, I know my own body and I trust myself to do this. If I were to go cold turkey and say call in sick how many days until the trembling subsides? Sorry if I sound self assured or ignorant about all of this I would just like someone to talk to without admitting to my family what I’ve done to myself.",2

Currently house-sitting for my sister and have had a lot of time to myself and be able to think how bad my relationship is with alcohol.

Family has a history of trauma and alcohol abuse. Currently live with my mom who I’ve watched drown her sorrow every weekend after work, which might be where I started emulating the way I drink. 

When I drink I don’t ever get to the point where I think “I should stop now otherwise I’m going to get very hungover”. Which is something I want to be able to do. 

It’s like when I get the feeling of inebriation I keep chasing that feeling by drinking more in order to keep the same level of drunkness it gives me til I fall asleep or blackout or both.

And I don’t know how to change that. How do you change your relationship with alcohol? Do you guys have any book tip or any other advice it would be very helpfull. Thank you in advance.",8

The next day at work is terrible. I am in a small company doing sales work. I should be cold calling and such but instead I just send one email every 30 minutes and get on reddit until the day passes. My anxiety sky rockets and it always seems my worst days of work are when I'm hungover (funny how that works). My girlfriend can tell when I drink the night before and gets very upset when I see her the day after a night of drinking. I love her very much and intend to marry her, so I got very worried when she said it was jeopardizing our relationship. 

Today I woke up sober. I'm not giving up and I'm doing my best. Times are tough for me financially, but I still decided to have my first appointment with a counselor a week ago and am seeing him again next week. I don't think I am ""cured"" but I feel like I am starting to see changes in my mentality where I feel like I actually want to stop drinking alone at home; for my health, my relationships, and my job.

Another friend when I told her I needed to quit. She that I basically just needed some self control. I had done that before, I had gone through 6 months or so where I only had two beers at night. Then 9 months later I'm crushing 6x that many. Then back and forth and back and forth. 

I'm powerless over it. I knew I was going to take that drink when it was put in front of me. And I knew in the back of my head I was going to pick up a 12 pack of shitty beer on the way home. And I also knew in my head that I should just go ahead and buy the 18 pack, so I don't drive drunk at 1:30 in the morning to get more booze... Then it's 1:30 in the morning and I'm listening to sad music to go get a six pack that I rationalized as a night cap. Lite beer to am alcoholic is like water. I just couldn't regularly move onto liquor because I knew it's what is killing my dad. Six pack is a snack to us beer drinkers.

So the hangover yesterday was hell, and even felt it today. I think I had more like 19 beers come to think of it. If we are counting ""standard beers.""

2020-07-09 10:16:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ho3tml/searching_a_new_path/,Searching a new path,"Dear Sirs and Madams,

I am today reaching out for help.

I am new here and, as in the Gil Scott-Heron song, I hope that no matter how far wrong you’ve gone, that you can always turn around. But I am not new to alcoholism.

I am 40 years old. I have lovely daughters and an awesome wife whose support has been overwhelming over the years.

I come from a happy family where I’m the third of four sons from my strong mom and dad. No one in my family is an alcoholic.

I grew up without any problems and graduate as an engineer and became a successful engineer at a tech company where I work.

I am more than happy to help anyone who needs, have a lot of good friends, and am perceived by all as a great guy.

I have no problems and should, by all standards, have a perfectly normal and happy life.

I started drinking at early age (around 14) and I remember getting smashed on the never ending afternoons of the summer vacations of high-school. And I kept drinking substantially throughout the years – and never gave much thought about it.

And here we are. I generally have 1 glass of wine for launch, and when I get home, I usually go through 2 litres of beer and a bottle of wine a night. I generally start when cooking and finish after dinner when the kids are already sleeping. I generally can keep my drunkenness out of my kids, but I can not obviously keep it from my wife. And this has taken a toll. Because she is afraid I might die – which is true since I have long stopped taking blood analysis to avoid seeing the numbers on cholesterol and other symptomatic indicators. I can keep this away from work and most of my family, but I need a new path.

I already tried twice to stop drinking but always kept coming back. Went to the AA’s for several months but at some point got fed up with the some over-narcissistic personalities and kept going on my own – and obviously failed. Went to a psychiatric who, at some point suggested that I moderate my drinking by drinking as much as my wife (at a time I was not drinking) which led me to quit. And then it all starts again, slowly, by drinking when having dinner out and then, I am back here…

I have even started doing Judo some years ago to take my mind off the drinking and no… I still do Judo and love it, I am a black belt, and still drink everyday…

I love my life, I do not want to die. I love my kids, I don’t want them to see me die for being an alcoholic. I do not want any of them to ever follow my drinking path.

And I do not want my wife and soul mate to live in the agony that I cause her for this disease I carry.

And I seem to be unable to see what triggers my willingness to drink. Maybe an overall state of depression that has been going on since I am a teenager?

I am not a man of faith.

I would like to know, for anyone that has been on a similar situation, what made you change your path and what kept you in it.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope I can come back to report that my path has taken a turn for the better.",6

I don't want to be, well I'm not sure I want to be alive anymore. But when I was drinking, I could forget anything, I may have been blind but I was happy. 

I cried most of the time in the car yesterday and only didn't stop to buy something because, well Im a total fucking mess. But I also don't want to hurt anymore. I want to be sober but I'm not sure I can and keep going. So what do I do? Why does it matter how many months of sobriety if I'm just going to hang myself anyways",0

2020-07-08 09:38:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hnh7mc/hoping_for_some_help_in_here/,Hoping for some help in here.,"Forgive the longish post - I'm writing this for myself more than anyone - please allow my self indulgence - I just feel if I put this in the public domain rather than on a word document I'll be admitting it to others as well I hope will understand, and maybe be able to offer some advice. Plus by saying it to others, I feel I will have more commitment to what I am about to undertake. I may use coarse language so apologies in advance if that's not allowed, but this is personal and this needs emphasis. Swears are good for that.

Bit of background - I'm middle aged, middle management and hold down a career. Have been drinking beer since I was a teenager - I'd class myself a beer aficionado - love my craft beers. Got a kid but single. Lived around the world and partied hard. Also I have bipolar disorder and have been known to self-medicate a lot.

I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I've screwed up a lot in the past - ruined relationships, damaged my career, absolutely damaged my health - both physical and mental. Woke up in places not knowing how the fuck I got there - bus shelters, church doorways. Made some bad mistakes and got away with too many. DUI's, inappropriate behavior. More blackouts than I could even count, and waking up with no recollection of a large part of the night before but that impending doom that you know you did something really stupid. Or wondering if you must have fallen down to explain the scrape on your arm. And countless other fuckups over the years

Thankfully always a happy drunk - charming as hell, life of the party. People like me as I am a good drinking buddy - for the most. Never violent, though sometimes very sad - the BP disorder was a lot of that.There has been a couple of times that has nearly culminated in me doing something very nasty to myself, but that's the BP and I'm not here about that.

I function - I have a good job and working from home allows me to wake up feeling like crap the morning after and just logging on. Of course I'm not very productive and can get away with a nap. I've also a couple of times when pulling a late one had a few beers whilst working which is a stupid thing to do. But whilst I function, the rest of the time I don't do a lot. The days after the night before consist of nothing more than lying on the couch watching TV and napping. It gets harder when you get older to just shake it all off.

And when I drink, it's never 1 or 2. Or at least very, very rarely. If I have a pint with my lunch that's pretty much the indicator that I'll be shitfaced by 10.

And I drink at home - alone - pretty much the same. Sometimes 7 nights a week.

When all this COVID stuff hit I decided one day to make a covenant for myself to get through this. I was going to exercise, learn some stuff, do some things I had been putting off for a while. I also made a conscious decision not to drink. Now I am fortunate that I don't crave alcohol - at least I don't think I do - maybe that's just denial. But I am not physically addicted - I can function without it, and can for the most take it or leave it, but alas do not do enough of the latter. I don't get up and need a beer to start the day and will keep the drinking until after hours. I know many of you will undoubtedly have different relationships and much harder struggles and I'm sure my own pale in significance and difficulty to those many people reading may face - my heart and support genuinely goes out to you.

I decided to do a month free from the sauce. Should be easy, all the bars are closed and I can't hang out with friends and have a few tins. And the money I would save would be good to clearing some of my debts (some of which were caused by alcohol related mistakes and shenanigans). And I got through the month fairly easily, so extended it to two, and then to three. I started running and found I could do it. I became productive - simple things like showering every day before work, maintaining my abode and keeping it reasonable became really simple and satisfying. I ate properly - hell even learned I can cook! My mental health was wonderful and I felt best I had in years. I kept my friends up to date but still promised that I would celebrate my 3 months up with a beer. I looked forward to it - after all I had earned it.

And sure enough, that Sunday came and I cracked open that first (and rather exclusive and sought after IPA) - and it was an anticlimax to be honest. It didn't taste as sweet as I have envisaged. But I quickly discovered old habits don't just go away. And at 4am the following morning when I finally crawled into bed I was back where I was 3 months earlier.

But you put that down to 'getting it out of your system', 'needing to tie one on', 'blow a fuse' or any other lame and tired excuse you have used a million times before. And I went a couple more days without a beer and thought I could continue like that. But nope, a couple of days later and I am doing it again. And I'm waking up groggy, have no impetus to do anything and before I know it it's 3pm and I haven't left the couch all day again. And whilst I was running every day, since going back on I haven't run once. My BP is slowly rising again and I look fatter. 3 months hard work down the fucking pan.

It's not just the mental health. The problem I have now is when I drink I physically hurt. I get dull pains all over my abdomen and sometimes my back - I'm sure it's reference pain as it seems to move about. They go after a day or two, and a recent bloodwork showed a very minute level issue and they want me to do a sonogram. And I should be very worried because this is simply isn't normal. 

Last night there were 6 cans in the fridge and whilst I was still aching from the night before, something told me that I should get them drunk and call it quits. And this morning I think I have come to term with the fact I have a problem with alcoholism. Oh sure I have known for years but I have never actually faced up to it.

(*Note I am not an alcoholic - I have alcoholism. Same with the bipolar. I don't let that define me so I can deal with it)

So today, I've decided that I need to stop. And for good. I have tried to have a healthy relationship with alcohol but I realize I just can't. 

It scares me as so much of my life - and good parts of it - revolve around socializing with beer. My boys weekends every year - I don't know how I am going to handle those, or if indeed I can ever go again (that breaks my heart more than anything as I love our travels). My best friends I know from the bars. I have very few teetotal friends, and pretty much all of them are overseas. I've already been contemplating moving away from the area I live in (I have no actual ties here) just so I can start again, like I have done so many times before. Make new friends, but not bar friends, you know? I'm even looking at dating teetotalers on the dating site I am on.

But I have to do something, else my kid won't have a Dad very soon.

If anyone who has so graciously read the above has any advice right now, I could really do with hearing it. And again, I apologize if this is self indulgent in any way or even irrelevant to the bigger struggles you have, but I'm hoping some of you can steer me on what is a very perilous road ahead.",3

I have a very high tolerance and rarely actually get “drunk” at this point and weigh about 135 lbs. but at aa meetings and in other forums I often hear people concerned about their alcohol use who consume less than half of what I do on a daily basis (and most of them are bigger than me).

My friend who I know since day 1 of my life was sober for 6 months 3 weeks ago. He wanted to celebrate. He chose an alcohol free beer. Everyone was against it. Every one being with him at his 6months sobrierity was trying to stop him. We took him to an alcohol free restaurant, no one was even mentioning alcohol, we all had great fun and he ordered at the desk a 0% beer. 

After he finished it he went to the toilet and... well. I found him yesterday. Pissed, dirty, having his own vomit over him, drunk AF, probably heavy drinking all the time. 

Of course he did affect his job, family and everything he worked for. He is a good manager, a great father and a good husband. When he is sober. 

Just a reminder that an alcoholic is only a small step ahead of the addiction. Doesn't take much to roll back. 

As a final note:

I brought him home, let him sober out, I did slap him when he got sober (we know each other for 30 years, he is my brother and I treat him like a brother. And he deserved an ol'good slap). Didnt give him much choice. Either we go to the addict centre now, or he may leave the house and never see me again.

[NSFW],"This is going to be a bit long and probably uncomfortable for people who are not comfortable reading about NSFW, please be advised. I need serious help only, this is not a joke. 
My boyfriend drinks very heavily due to the fact that he has coprophila (scat fetish.) He drinks up to two bottles of Jim beam every day. Although I have been very supportive with his coprophila, I cannot do everything he wants all the time because of my IBS. And he says that he understands that I can't control my bowels but he definitely blames me for it by the way he talks when he is drunk. He uses the liquor as a coping mechanism and he's admitted that, but says ""I can't stop drinking unless things change."" At this point, his drinking has caused him to get stomach ulcers. He isn't even the man that I fell in love with now. I feel awful knowing that he's doing this because of me. I don't want to lose him, but I cannot watch him constantly destroy himself over things I cannot control. I have gone to the doctor's  many times to try to get my IBS better, but it takes time and he seems to not be willing to wait. I am debating leaving him, because getting blamed for this honestly is ruining my mental state as well. I want to try and get him to turn to a healthier coping mechanism, I want to help him. But he refuses to listen to me. His parents are alcoholics and his friends are enablers. I feel like I'm the only one who cares about his well being. How do I help him?",2

Since around January or February I’ve been drinking every single night minus maybe 3-4 days. It started out with just a glass or 2 of wine. Now it’s almost a full bottle or more some nights. I only drink in the evenings after dinner until my husband decides to go to bed. Almost every night I tell myself that I’m not going to drink the next day, but then I do. I think about drinking almost all day. I’m not always counting down til my next drink, sometimes it’s just thoughts about alcohol or wondering if I have a problem or not. I get stressed if I think I’m going to run out of wine or may not have enough to get through the night. Lately I’ve even been wondering what it’d be like to have a drink in the mornings. I haven’t felt the need to drink in the morning, but I just like to think about the idea. I can’t seem to just have one glass. If I have one, I’m going to keep drinking til I go to bed. I snack all night as I drink to avoid getting sick or too buzzed/drunk. I guess I’m not sure if it’s a problem, because I’m pretty confident I wouldn’t have withdrawals if I quit, I just can’t make myself quit right now. Also I haven’t had any real negative consequence happen other than I’m spending a lot of money every week on wine, but it’s also not breaking the bank. And I’ve probably gained a few pounds. Other than my husband no one even knows I really drink besides a little bit socially. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it either, so just looking for opinions and advice. Thanks!",1

I’m proud that she has acknowledged it and is part of a group therapy session (currently over zoom), but I’m still coming home to her drunk. Right now it’s 11am and she’s slurring her words with incoherent sentences. I think COVID has likely been hard on her because she’s home all day without a lot to do but she doesn’t seem to be taking the therapy too seriously if she chooses to day drink on days when she doesn’t have to meet with them over zoom. 

It makes it even more challenging that it’s my mom and not a friend because she tends to brush off serious conversations, but she does take my opinion seriously. How do you help someone who is going through this? Do you make more plans with them- hikes, walks, coffee runs, etc, so that they can’t drink? Do you confront them to say how much it hurts you? Do you suggest a more aggressive treatment approach?",2
2020-07-06 10:39:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hm8tk6/almost_did_it_yesterday/,Almost did it yesterday,"7 months sober and I haven’t really had too much of an issue staying sober until yesterday. Girlfriend and I had an argument the day before about something stupid which happens from time to time but In the middle of it she told me some shit that was way over the line. Basically for a whole year before I got sober I did nothing but drink. I didn’t cheat or get abusive I literally just ignored everything and got fucked up day in and day out. Because of that I put her through a lot but these last 7 months i have done everything to fix the mess I made and fix our relationship. At first she just kept telling me what a horrible person I was (mind you she has beef with alcohol that stems from her family years before my drinking became an issue) and how lucky I was she was still here for me. That passed but 7 months later her opinions have yet to really change it seems and she finally was very vocal about it during a stupid argument that really didn’t call for that level of bullshit...

So a day later I’m still pissed, but I kept it to myself. I can’t drink where I live now but I had a plan. I planted the seeds by saying I need a day alone to myself to focus on what I’m doing with my life. I found a hotel and was ready to book two nights. One night for drinking and a second day to recover and remove any booze stank so by the tied day I can come home without any trace of anything happening. The hotel I picked was right next to a grocery store so getting booze would be easy. I planned on turning off my phones location so she could not track me and show up in the middle of my planned binge. With my credit info ready to go on the booking page I debated for hours. I was weighing risk vs reward on this whole adventure. I thought about the hangover, the possible withdrawal even from one night of drinking and I figured I was willing to go through with it for this one night of drinking. I thought about getting caught which will lead to me getting kicked out out and figured I have places to stay if shit hits the fan like that, sure it will be with people who party and do drugs but I’m strong enough to just keep this to one night of drinking and not fall into that bullshit.... I was kidding myself at this point and I knew it. But still I didn’t care and I was ready. 

The last thought I had before pulling the trigger was “man, this little adventure is about to cost me a shit ton of money for one night of boozing.” That thought pulled me way back to reality. I realized how great I have been doing these last 7 months and if she can’t see that that’s her problem not mine. I should not be running away from my home, spending all this money just to drink and get away from her. Why would I punish myself and jeopardize everything because of her. I can’t let booze have that power over me and I can’t let her have that power over me either. We have been together for 5 years but honestly I’m not comfortable with her driving me to that point of no return. So I decided to not let her have that much power over me. She can say and do what she wants but if I know I’m doing good those negative words don’t mean anything... unlike when I was fucking up. 

So I decided to treat myself instead of running away. I have every game console except a ps4 and there are three games I really want to play. The girlfriend gave me shit awhile ago for wanting to buy the console just for three games and said it was a waste of money  because I have my other games.... so I never did buy it. Well, I took the money I was about to throw away on a hotel and booze and bought it. Came home and sat my ass down playing it. She wasn’t happy but I was okay with what I did and she eventually came around apologizing for what she had said. I’m still not okay with how far she decided to go with this argument but for what she said I’ll forgive her and take the apology. 

Last note, going out and spending money the way I did can be considered just as destructive as drinking to some, but I don’t see it being that bad I have the money currently and my bills are paid plus money saved. Also I know there are better ways to deal with the issue I had but I still think I did the right thing.",10

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hgtq3w/my\_wife\_is\_an\_alcoholic\_in\_recovery\_and\_shes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hgtq3w/my_wife_is_an_alcoholic_in_recovery_and_shes/)   


I recently sent her an email regarding upcoming mediation for a separation agreement and eventual full divorce. I suggested to her that for financial reasons related to our son being in college that we wait until the end of the year before finalizing the divorce.  


She has been obtuse and dismissive of any needs beyond her own sobriety during this whole process. I also expressed that I was having suicidal thoughts because of her insensitive actions (I am in therapy for those concerned) and so I sarcastically ended the message with ""but whatever, you go on with your bad self.""  


She apparently found this hilarious, and posted the attached at her FB page (I have since been blocked from viewing it; I was previously unfriended along with all my family members and mutual friends). Every one of the people who responded are among her closest AA friends and one of them is her sponsor.  


I know that her sponsor and other AA friends have been encouraging her to leave the marriage. As I stated in my original post, I am culpable for a lot of bad behavior in the marriage that may have led to her drinking, even if I'm not responsible for the alcoholism per se. I have apologized repeatedly for my behavior and am taking active steps through counseling to change it. My wife has never admitted any fault for the breakdown of the marriage, nor has she ever apologized for her drinking. Like the alcohol, I am an evil force in her life that must be expunged at all costs and no matter what the long lasting collateral damage may be.  


Whatever my culpability for the situation, I think it's entirely inappropriate to make fun of a spouse who has or is considering suicide due to the alcoholic's antisocial behavior. Should I just let this go, or is it worth alerting someone at AA about this? Is this kind of cultish all-for-one and one-for-all behavior typical of AA groups?

It numbed me inside and I hit the bottle really hard afterwards. If I weren't working I'd be drinking. Every Monday I'd get off work for years I would get 2 4 Lokos and have them both downed by the time I got home. And even then I would skip on my beers and whiskey. Well, as time went on it affected my relationship with the woman I love dearly and our kids. It turned me into a verbally abusive father and partner. I kept basically to myself and didnt care to those around me. I became the monster I wish I could have never been. Nearly a month ago after the smallest of arguements my love had enough and left. That night I lost control of my drinking and got belligerent and went outside and just let my rage out(live out deep in woods). She came home the next day and we decided it was time for a ""break"" and see how things would come after it's said and done. After she left after the discussion I self reflected hard. I was angry and depressed and all sorts of negative emotions because my life came to a screeching halt. I went into the kitchen and on top of the fridge grabbed the handle of Jim Beam apple that was basically full and poured every last drop of it down the drain. I proceeded to grab the Jagermeister and the 20 beers in the fridge and did the same. I knew then I needed to stop. I felt like I lost my family and couldn't get them back if I didnt self reflect and fight my demons. As of right now I'm on day 23 of being sober and I feel amazing. My relationship with my kids are better than ever. I extended the break a bit longer because I had some hiccups along the way that I couldn't get my mind around. All in all I'm healthier, I drink plenty of water now and have actually lost a bunch of that weight the alcohol had on me. I workout and diet now looking forward to a new better me. I'm staying hopeful at the end of the day things between me and her stay good. Regardless of decision at the end I dont want to touch alcohol again. Thanks for reading my past month as I found this has helped me most laying it out there and owning up to my mistakes.

I use to drink so much. 24 beers a day even with a fifth sometimes. Got to the point that I couldn’t even drink one beer without wanting more and more and more until I blacked out. Now, what I did might not be for everyone, but considering the constant drinking, I also gained quite a lot of weight, thus I, for some reason, felt that I needed to lose weight more than stop drinking.

So, I ended up going on a 4 day water fast. I just broke my fast by eating a steak, of which I couldn’t even finish 3/4 of it. Beforehand, I could drink 20+ beers and a bunch of fast food with ease. Now? Can barely eat a steak....nonetheless, this also helped me overcome my need to drink. I absolutely feel no desire in drinking. I haven’t even thought about it until a few minutes ago.

Not saying fasting is for everyone, but there’s a lot of benefits to it, especially in terms of cleaning your body. Give it a try if you can, can’t hurt.

I have a friend who drinks. When she does, she usually drinks too much and gets drunk. And we, her friends, have to take care of her, and occasionally deliver her to her house.

She always says ""i don't drink too much"" or ""if i want to, i stop drinking"" and what not. She never does. She has been drinking too much almost every time for about a year and a half or more.

But today crossed the line. She drank and drank, we told her to stop, forcefully tried to make her stop, but she didn't. Then, she couldn't keep her balance. Next, she was crying uncontrollably. Last, she fell unconscious and we had to call an ambulance. She is currently in the hospital, in an alcohol induced coma. 

I am not here to ask for medical advice. I am here to ask, I've been discussing this with her best friend; how do I convince her to stop drinking alcohol for some time? The amount of times she's drank dangerous amounts is high, but never something like this. We always tell her to not drink so much, but even when she's aware and knows she's getting drunk, she keeps at it. We don't understand. 

How would I convince her to stay sober for a long time after she wakes up?",6

A friend and I had decided to stop drinking together. We would call and text each other and talk about what we were going through. Then she stopped calling me after going out of town

I found out she has gone back to drinking and is attempting moderation, a thing we both talked about as not working for us. We are both overachievers when it comes to drinking beer. Lol

When I found out she was drinking again I didn’t get mad or shame her. I know that’s not the way. But I was hurt, none the less. So I went to my first AA meeting. I enjoyed it and know it will help with this upset in my sober game plan. 

However, this messes up some plans we had before. We were supposed to go on a trip that up until now would have been completely dry. I still want to go, but her picking up again makes me wary. 

Have you had something like this happen? How do you deal with it? Do you need to encourage a person who’s struggling to stop drinking if they pick up again or accept and be patient? Is it even my business?

Also since it’s effecting me negativity (making plans less tenable due to temptation to drink) should I speak to her about it, like a heart to heart? 

I’ve known her for 10 years and she’s had a drinking issue the whole time. I know she’d be so much happier if she stopped and I’m here to help. Also, selfishly, it helped me to help her. I’m just totally bummed.",5

Soon after, she told my brother what had happened and he was FURIOUS which is 100% understandable.   
I haven't talked to my family about this yet but I plan too.  The worst part is that my fiance doesn't know about this.  I am telling her today. 

Because of my alcoholism, Ive ruined my financials, my health and my current relationship time and time again.  Im so lost right now.  

I honestly just plan to leave my city and never return.  Maybe even change my name, cancel my cellphone and buy a cheap metro phone and live a different life.  Hurt doesnt describe the condition that I'm in right now.

I had been drinking every night for about 2 1/2 years. I went through a tough withdrawal (no seizures, no visiual hallucinations. Had some audible hallucinations, only when dozing off). After I finished withdrawals I was sober for just over a week. I then started drinking at night. From around 9pm-2am. I did this for about a month. I was also taking Phentermine at the time the drinking started to help with weight loss. Today I woke up feeling just fine for the majority of the day, then suddenly in the late afternoon, my palms were sweaty, my body felt cold (no fever tho), my fingers felt numb (felt like I couldn’t grab things properly, Idk it was weird), and I had some anxiety because of these symptoms, it reminded me of the withdrawal I experienced before which made me freak out slightly. I drank a little bit hoping it would settle these feelings if only for a little while so I could come up with a plan or at least mentally prepare myself for what I thought was to come. After that wore off I felt similar symptoms, not as intense but enough to bother me. Overthinking about these symptoms might have caused me to feel worse than I actually was I’m not sure. Anyway, last time I went through withdrawal I went to the hospital, they gave me meds that helped, but I’m hurting financially so I’m wondering if anyone has any tips to help get through withdrawals. Idk how bad I expect them to get, I’m hoping it won’t get too bad, because my last withdrawal happened after a 3 day bender where I drank literally every second that I was awake, this time I only drank at night so hoping it’s not as bad, and that I’m able to go back to work in 2 days. I absolutely plan on going to the hospital if it gets as bad as last time, but for now If anyone has tips on helping with symptoms and getting through it plz let me know! 🙏🏼",5

Well today he found a half pint i hid for the weekend so i didnt gave to go up to gas station and olus i think it would help if i got out of the habit of going up to the gas station. 

Anywyas. He found it and is raging mad, cant talk to me is so upset and mad and he wants to break it off with me now i think. He left in a huff didnt want to hear my excuse. 

I dont know how to feel. I feel bad but he was already controlling to begin with and my therapist said it wasnt a good idea for him to make the rules of stopping drinking. I was tapering off...

I'm 35 and I drink somewhere about/over a 5th of rum per day. This has resulted in frightening results from blood labs from my doctor. She took the time out of her schedule to call me on a Saturday to talk about the results and how I can get help. On her recommendation a referral was put in to a local rehab facility.

I went in for the intake visit. It took me almost an hour to fill out the intake paperwork because my hands were shaking so badly. (I have an essential tremor, but I know the alcohol is contributing to it immensely)

I was brought into the office of the intake counselor. She was exceptionally friendly, compassionate, and understanding the entire time. I felt I could trust her immediately. She asked me a lot of questions about my history and my current status. It was the first time in a long while that I've been completely honest about my drinking problem, with myself or another living being. 

After our discussion she recommended that I check in for a 28-day inpatient medical detox and rehabilitation program. I instantly broke down. How can I do something like this? How can I take the time off work? How can I afford the time off? What do I do about my cats? Breathe. 

Since we've been under quarantine and I've been working from home I've had nothing but constant opportunity to drink throughout the day. I never drink to the point of interfering with my work, but I definitely have learned to drink to feel normal.

I've started waking up with a much more pronounced tremor to the point that it's difficult to manipulate my trackpad and keyboard on my laptop. I've started needing to drink in the morning just to quell the symptoms and be a productive human being.

I'm scheduled to admit to the medical detox facility on 7/18. I had to schedule it out that far to give my employer enough notice to take (essentially) FMLA for medical leave. I've arranged with my state unemployment department to cover part of my paycheck each week and my employer offers a short term disability benefit that will cover the rest. 

There we go. I've figured out how to be out of work that long and how to fund it.

I was able to find a cat sitter to take care of my two monsters while I'm away. It's not the cheapest option, but I believe they'll be well cared for and that helps to take some burden off my shoulders.

I've made arrangements with my ex-husband/closest friend to handle my finances while I'm in treatment. He'll serve as an emergency contact for the cats in case something happens and there's a vet bill or something. He's also graciously offered to help me by paying my bills and expenses while I'm gone. I couldn't have found a better friend to help support me through this.

Today I was supposed to meet up with my ex to deal with some paperwork on his car. When I woke up I was so dizzy and shaky I didn't feel I'd be safe to drive. I ultimately cancelled our plans. I feel like utter human waste for letting my addiction interfere with something important to one of the most important people in my life. But here, I did. I sent an apology, but I know that can't heal the wound I've opened.

Rehab can't come soon enough. I'm so tired of living this way. I feel like a complete drain on my friends and family. I will say that all my friends and family that I've told, pretty much everyone I interact with regularly, has been very supportive and cheerleaders for me.

I have 16 days until I go in. I'll celebrate a birthday in the meantime. 

That's my story. I'm hopeful for my future.",21

Obviously I drink too much and I have been cutting down in terms of frequency, but I haven't really cut down on actual amount consumed. Like, instead of drinking every day or every other day, I drink 2-3x a week, with days off in between, but I definitely binge.

Please feel free to comment, ask any questions, or talk about your own situation here; browsing this subreddit has helped me stay off the poison during the first couple months of this journey and I want to return the favor (I might not respond immediately, but I will respond!)

&#x200B;

First of all, I am a 31 year-old male from Italy; I had been drinking (and smoking) since I was about fifteen; local bars served me heavy spirits no problem during my early drinking years, which resulted in me getting hooked on them very young and very hard. I would go through periods of drinking heavily every day, and periods of drinking not-so-heavily every other day or so, which still made my life a complete mess.

&#x200B;

Now to a little list of benefits I am experiencing so far, in the hopes of inspiring some of you to finally take the leap: on January the 2nd 2020, I quit both alcohol and cigarettes, cold turkey.

The first thing I'm going to say is that, as a drinker, I could barely find the mental energy to do anything: the anxiety that resulted from withdrawals turned the simplest of tasks - like buying groceries - into an exhausting ordeal.

I can't believe I actually have a decent amount of energy during the day now; I can finally manage a normal life, even if there's still lots of room for improvement.

For the first time in my life I am able to consistently keep my apartment tidy and clean, for example. In my worst alcoholic sprees, I would just leave trash/clothes all over the floor and not wash dishes (or myself, at the lowest of the lows) for days on end.

I finally chose something that I can turn into a career and started getting some education \~ enrolled in a web development school and have actual goals for the next 3-5 years for the first time in my life.

I always used to just live day by day, or week by week, consumed by the constant up-and-downs of alcoholism; I'd drink a bunch of spirits and suddenly start fantasizing about actually doing something with my life, feel really euphoric and positive about it, only to forget it all once the effect wore out and the depression kicked in. So I mostly just kept working odd jobs (or not doing anything at all), going through the motions and not really going anywhere.

Quitting alcohol has also made it A LOT easier for me to quit smoking as well, so that's a huge plus, too. Both of these things combined, in turn, made my kickboxing training a lot easier, which resulted in me getting back to a good physical shape and technical prowess. This brings me lots of joy and self-confidence.

My mood has improved drastically: not having to constantly deal with that terrible guilt, the hangovers, mood swings, chronic fatigue etc. every day, not having to feel like an anxious mess for days after a drinking session: it's like I'm finally starting to feel ""normal"" again, for the first time in many long years.

I am closer to my family; for example, my dear old grandma lives 5 minutes away but I'd very rarely go visit her; anxiety and depression - mostly caused by my drinking - made me want to just stay in my shell. Now I am able to actually have a relationship with her and I usually see her once or twice a week. 

My sleep is getting progressively better; I am finally able to consistently go to bed relatively early and wake up early in the morning without feeling like an absolute trainwreck.

I am saving money: spending about 20-25% of my salary on alcohol/cigarettes/shitty late night meals seems absolutely absurd to me now.

I am slowly getting more grounded in my relationships; I am becoming less needy, more assertive. I feel like I'm actually worth something.

My beloved 650cc motorcycle is my only means of transportation, and I used to ride it after a few (or a lot of) drinks all the time. Now that's gone, too.

&#x200B;

I am slowly but surely going back to being the healthy, happy, good looking, stable man I was always supposed to be.

I will never touch alcohol again.

You have a great day and thank you all.",100

Spent all 5 days eating like crazy. 

I developed a restrictive eating disorder at 12, binge eating at 14 relapsed info restriction at 19 after bipolar symptoms affected my appetite. Started to struggle more to lose weight once I got to 140 lbs but still look fat at 140 lbs, finally started to look thin at 128 lbs and have gone between 140 and 128 for about 3 years.
Finally about a year ago I got down to 127 lbs and started taking lithium. I gained up to 145 practically overnight when my body image was so bad so I took up drinking.

Now I’m off the meds, I refuse to take them.
I can’t lose weight because I start to lose but either gain it back by binge drinking days at a time, or binge eating. The binge eating is actually worse and more expensive than alcohol. Go figure.
I lose 5 or so pounds and then gain it back because I can’t stay away from the alcohol or binge drinking and it doesn’t make a difference if I starve myself or lose weight in a healthier way. It’s always the same.

The lithium and alcohol ruined the body I finally was ok with a year ago. I can’t go to family dinners or BBQs anymore because there’s food there.
I’m gonna be 23 in September and want to lose 30 lbs before mid August.
I only want to lose weight to wear my old clothes and get fucked up. It’s almost like there’s no point.

My life is so lonely and boring I keep drinking and I hate myself so much I won’t eat at all tomorrow.
A creepy guy who was hitting on me a year ago got a job where I work so now he sees me all the time and sometimes still tries to get me to be closer with him. He recently lost a lot of weight. So him being near me is another eating disorder trigger. I have work tomorrow. I work in a grocery store I hate being surrounded by food because I either take something fattening home (or order out) if I’m not drinking.

I just don’t think there’s a way out of feeling like this unless I starve myself for a few weeks while staying sober and it’s so hard to do at the moment but it’s the only thing I can do. The only other way out of being stuck like this is dying.
At least for tomorrow I’ll be sober because I can’t eat or get drunk but after that who knows when I’ll fail. Whether I do or not the next few weeks are going to be hell.",2

2020-07-01 22:57:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hjp1pn/staying_up_late_is_most_of_the_problem_i_think/,"Staying up late is most of the problem, I think...","First of all, I'm not downplaying the significance of a drinking problem.  I like beer WAY too much, and unfortunately acquired a taste for it long ago.  I've always had a pretty high tolerance for it, too.  Have tried multiple times to quit, unsuccessfully.  Never been into liquor, just plain old beer, any kind, but usually cheap & fairly low-point stuff.  My problem's probably pretty common--I drink one ice-cold beer, and then want another one.  And then another.

However, I'm never tempted to drink during the day.  There is something about that that just seems depressing and unappealing to me.  My problem is, I'm a night owl, and have always been, even as a kid.  I have never liked going to bed and have always had difficulty falling asleep.  Just can't turn my mind off.  I've never looked at going to bed as a relief--mentally, going to bed always feels like admitting defeat that the day is over.

So the main problem seems to be staying up to late, which is when drinking beer is appealing and habitual.  If I weren't staying up late, I wouldn't be drinking.  I've never had the desire to drink in the morning, or at lunch, or in the afternoon.  There is something about night that makes me want to drink, though.

This is very immature behavior and I'm way too old to have absolutely no control over going to bed at a reasonable hour and not drinking beer after beer.  I wish I could figure out a way to fall asleep early and wake up early, and stop trying to drag out the night hours.

An example of how stubborn my mind is at not being able to shut down & go to sleep--a while back I drove with a friend across several states, all day long, hundreds and hundreds of miles, to help them move.  We drove ALL day and finally got to the motel in the middle of the night.  My friend walked into the motel room and immediately went to sleep.  I, on the other hand, had to stop at a gas station, get some beer, and stay up even longer, sipping beer and looking at my phone.  I absolutely was not sleepy, but should've been completely exhausted.  Every now & then, they would wake up & groggily see that I was still awake, and I'm sure they were thinking WTF.

I also have depression and anxiety (ever since I can remember, from way way way before I ever drank).  I've also usually lived mostly alone and there is definitely an element of loneliness involved with this irrational need to stay up late and drink beer.

A side note:  I have a tendency to want to drink pretty much any liquid to excess.  Water, sodas, coffee, juice, etc.  There was a time where I would drink cup after cup of coffee, all day long.  I have somehow managed to curb that.  I don't know why I was so addicted to coffee, because I never really liked the taste all that much, and I didn't like the jittery feeling, but I would just keep guzzling it.  Now I just have a little in the morning.  I'm the same way with a lot of foods.  If I buy sliced turkey for sandwiches, it's pretty much all gone immediately.  I wouldn't say I have an eating disorder, just that when there are things I like the taste of around, I tend to devour them.  It's too bad that beer is one of those things I really like.

I do not have the insurance or the funds to get on the medications I've seen mentioned here that have helped people stop drinking.  The only thing I can think of to do is to remove the time frame (late night) of when the desire to drink kicks in.  But I'm failing at that, every night.

Also, nothing I've ever tried to distract myself with has ever helped (excercise, running, going on long walks, eating healthy, trying to substitute drinking with other drinks like water or soda, etc).  I can put on running shoes and go for an hour walk listening to headphones...but as soon as I get back home, even if it's 10:00, 11:00 pm, I have an overwhelming urge to start drinking beers.

I don't think I've ever said any of this stuff out loud or told anyone, so I'm sorry if this is long and boring.  I am just curious how common it is to not be able to fall asleep, and stay up too late drinking.  I'm aware that it's said that alcoholic drinks actually disturb your sleep rather than help you relax, but it is what it is, this is where I am.

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas on how to stop this awful routine.  I'm well aware of the bad health effects of drinking, and it is frustrating to know it and still keep doing it.  The thing to do would just be to stop, but I haven't been able to.

I hope no one minds, but I'm typing this entry simply as a way of doing something with what is for me an unprecedented amount of anxiety from detoxing. If I accidentally process some emotions along the way, so much the better.

I'm on what is now my sixth or seventh detox in the past half decade. If you had told me at twenty-two--even though there were warning signs--that by thirty-two I would throw not just a wrench but an entire fucking toolbox into what once looked like a bright future, I would never have believed it. Alcoholism or any form of drug addiction seemed to me back then like something that could only happen to other people: the kids from high school who yelled at teachers, people from shitty daytime TV shows about ""rough areas""--but not me, the quiet kid with weird hobbies who mostly tried to stay out of everyone's way. I understand now of course that alcoholics come in so many varieties you could start a chain called Build-A-'Holic, but the disbelief still lingers: this is me rocking back and forth on my bed fearing I may never feel normal again, this is what I've done with my life.

I had a solid year and a half of sobriety from alcohol under my belt, but then I got a separate, unrelated health problem. Three years into a PhD program, I caught mononucleosis, recovered from it, but then started having recurring bouts of staggering fatigue, and I never quite felt at full energy anymore. That pattern--major illness followed by lingering fatigue--more or less fits the pattern of most people with chronic fatigue syndrome, though I've never gotten an official diagnosis because it's a diagnosis of exclusion: they do a bunch of other expensive tests, then when everything turns out negative, they just lob the chronic fatigue label at you (or more recently, encephalomyelitis). Trying to write a dissertation and teach with chronic fatigue is a nightmare--I was desperate for a solution.

After trying a few other medications, I requested that we try Vyvanse because I noticed that when I took friends' Adderall recreationally (red flag!), my fatigue went away and I felt like my old self: I could concentrate, I could enjoy things, I felt connected to people again. Vyvanse, I had heard, was more difficult to abuse and less addictive, so I thought I would be safe despite my history of addiction. Ha! I got the prescription and my day soon revolved around when I could take my pills. I often took more than my prescribed dose for the first half of the month, then crashed the second. I was obsessed with my work while high and indifferent to everything and everyone else, and then when I crashed I was irritable and incapable of doing something so basic as washing a dish with too much food on it.

And then two months ago my cat, [the absolute best cat in the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybrosgonemild/comments/ee09pl/every_time_i_try_to_practice/) (don't argue--it's a fact), died an upsetting death. Within the space of a weekend he went from seeming entirely healthy to sneezing blood and finally to having his back half suddenly go paralyzed. I still cannot get out of my mind the image of him dragging himself along the carpet, not understanding what was happening to him, and the frustration I felt knowing he expected me to do something about it and I couldn't. Those were the last hours of his life and they were horrifying, bewildering, and painful for him. I feel this weird guilt over the smallest details of it. While we waited for the vet's office to open, I was trying to say my goodbyes to him and tell him how grateful I was to have spent eight years with him, and I kept having to correct myself because I kept saying, ""You were really the best cat,"" even though he was still alive. What a stupid detail to have guilt over: *the verb tense I used in speaking to a cat that didn't understand English and no doubt had more important shit on his mind at the moment anyway*.

After his death I started smoking pot--not my usual drug--around the clock while popping my Vyvanse like candy for two solid weeks. Eventually I developed some pretty scary cognitive and nervous symptoms, which eventually led me to the ER. They said I probably didn't much worse than give my nervous system a shock and hopefully only temporarily strip my dopamine receptors, but after a few weeks I started developing [akathisia](https://www.medprodisposal.com/healthcare/akathisia-15-things-to-know-about-this-horrible-condition/)\--a pretty nasty withdrawal symptom even in the mild form I had--which I ended up using alcohol as a way of soothing.

The akathisia subsided and I'm currently on Librium to ease the withdrawal symptoms from yet another alcohol detox, but it's less effective than it has been in the past. The level of anxiety I feel is unbearable. I'm very tired, but when I tried to sleep a few hours ago, I jerked awake with my heart racing and a weird moan in my throat, and now I'm afraid to try to sleep again.

The thing is: I'm still on the shallow end of how ugly the types of things I've done can get. I've never had a seizure, let alone DTs, but right now my body feels like it wants somehow to outrun itself, my mood is in the gutter, and it's just really hard to believe that I'll feel normal again.",14
