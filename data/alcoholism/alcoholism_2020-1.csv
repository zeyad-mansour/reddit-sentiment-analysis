I (21M)  have recently picked up the whiskey-end-of-day habit. It started with one bottle out of curiosity and 6 months later I’m drinking 3 shots a night (two on the rocks). A good buzz but nothing more, except for Friday I usually get drunk. 

It’s hasn’t affected my schooling in engineering, my job, my relationships, nor my workout schedule, however close friends (roommates) and mother have commented on it. She was in AA briefly herself. Runs in my family and at this point I won’t deny the addiction. 

I enjoy Kratom and a friend mentioned it’s a good transition from the former, is this viable? Better? Also a daily smoker (that THC type shit). 

I know Kratom is addicting, but if it lessens my depression and anxiety as my 4 other prescribed meds do, all equally addictive, where’s the line? 

Really in a scared spot, feel like I’m failing my future self. Don’t know if I’m over reacting or under. All help appreciated.",3

I’m the youngest of four boys and my mother’s always had problems. Her father died when I was about 3 so I can’t remember how she was after it, my father always said that’s why she became an alcoholic but she always sort of was before it too.

My grandmother treated my mother like shit and made her do all the cooking and cleaning and everything to maintain the house when she was younger, she even charged my mother for babysitting any of us. She was and still is a true nasty piece of work who favours my uncle over my mother. I sometimes think this is why she’s an alcoholic. I’m the only one left in the house with her and most nights I get met with hate and rage in her eyes because I look like my father, my dad cheated on her about 6 years ago and they divorced but it made her worse and me being the only one left in the house and looking like my father, it was directed all to me. She’d kick me out of the house, punch, kick and slap me. Once telling me she didn’t know she was pregnant with me at the start and had went through some sort of operation and I survived, when I was a boy she’d call me her miracle. She used it against me and told me she lied and seeing he way I turned out she wished I had of died whenever she got drunk of course. You get used to the abuse that I don’t care about.

What I’m worried about is my behaviour towards drugs and alcohol, I smoke weed everyday. I have since I was 13. It has become an addiction at this point, I messed around with co-codamols(which is a painkiller that contains codeine) I took 18 one day not all at once but spread out during the day, I started vomiting blood and was in hospital. I stopped taking them and now I drink when I can’t afford weed. I just feel I’m going in the same spiral as my mother and the thought scares the shit out of me. When I’m not drunk or high I get fidgety and feel like a crackhead. I’ve been to the doctors who have sent me through different addiction groups I had to contact them myslef and where I am is out in the country so things like funding addiction courses out there isn’t possible. I rang so many places all sending me to different one until I said fuck it no one seems to care. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you",1

Few months later I'm feeling way better, then of course more stuff happens, few days of the sweats, the shakes, hallucinations, and of course another seizure. 

Well after that (this is day 5 sober) I'm sitting here like, things are looking up finally. I'm close to a new job, I'm growing a nice garden, I'm fixing up my old car (which I love) and I'm like, ok, this is the one. 

Here's the problem I could use some advice on. All my friends are saying ""hey how's it going?"" I know what they mean. Chit chat for a while. ""Ok bud sounds like you're doing well call me if you need me."" 

""But then....there is my family. ""You better not be drinking again! ""You know drinking will kill you! When was the last time you drank! Don't lie to me."" And of course I say ""I'd like you to be a little more helpful."" ""Well if you didn't do this we wouldn't be so worried.""

Alcohol fills the void, and the only moments that I feel the slightest sense of well-being is when I am blind drunk, in which case I marvel at the simple fact of being alive. 

Why do I have to rely on this substance that is quite literally killing me, just to feel the same as everybody else? And further to that point, how am I possibly meant to quit? I don’t think I’m strong enough to do this.",4
2020-01-30 01:58:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ew1efc/realizing_partner_is_high_functioning_alcoholic/,Realizing partner is High Functioning Alcoholic,"I'm a 37yo M who has a history of heavy drinking and at times bing drinking and I've felt dependency develop a few times but I've been able to thankfully cut back when I've really needed to without too much trouble. However as I've recently cut way back after about 3 years of pretty constant heavy drinking I've reflected on my current partners (34yo F) drinking habits and I'm realizing they truly are an alcoholic, albeit a high-functioning one. Single mom, excels at her work and her life is mostly on track. But I wanted to share some of the things I've personally noticed in their habits that stood out to me incase it helps someone else realize their person might truly have a problem.

1) When I bring up the subject of their drinking I invariable get the retort that I am ""judging"" them no matter how I frame my question. 

2) They have multi-day benders. Whereas I might drink heavy and be hungover for a good day - and then usually wait at least 36-48 hours before I even look at alcohol again - they will just keep their buzz going by drinking as early as they can...9am...10am. But sometimes still go to work...pick up her kids buzzed etc. 

3) They will regularly drink before going to work and sometimes it's not a small amount. Gum and mints are a constant necessity for this reason. I am often also asked to smell their breath to see if I can smell booze. 

4) They will be late in coming home from when they said they would be home and not text -- I'll be watching her kids and making dinner and I don't mind. But when I ask them to kindly let me know if they're heading out to the bar to just shoot me a quick text just so I know what's going on. But I often get a defensive response and some bit about how I'm too nosy and about how they feel anxious that they feel like they have to check in with me. 

5) They have a distinct ""drunk"" personality and a ""sober"" one and I am crazy in love with the sober one but often find myself incredibly annoyed at the drunk version of her. 

6) They dont make very much money but easily spend $100/wk on beer, wine and going out. And that's just solely for themselves. 

7) They purposely go to dives that serve strong drinks even if they're dangerous or out of the way. 

Anyhow -- I know this isn't a unique situation and I would leave her if everything else about the relationship wasnt good. They are a very loving person and is a good mother to her kids and I dont think shes ever really putting them at risk because she has enough sense to only get truly wasted when she knows theyre being cared for. But I start to resent her when I notice this intense split in drunk/sober personalities and the defensive guarding when I bring up her habits. I just am not sure how to help her cut back. 

Any suggestions welcome.",3

Reading around about other experiences with alcohol kind of confuses tho. I never get hangovers. I, perhaps, assume this is because I stay pretty hydrated (120oz+ of water per day and only drink loose leaf tea)? I don't do mixed drinks or even like them. I drink straight and chase with water (while also drinking water), which feels way better than chasing with soda or anything else, anyway.

I confronted him in a nice way multiple times about it afterwards and initially he tried to down play it but eventually admitted it was a problem, but then looked me dead in the eye and said “I have no plans on quitting.”  

I reached out to his brother and family but they were of little help. After a few months he ended up moving back in with them, and I’ve only seen him sporadically since, partly because I feel uncomfortable being around him when he drinks (I’ve told him this many times, and he understood, but still won’t quit). Anyway, I saw him for his bday recently and once again he was wasted. I didn’t want to bring it up while he was drunk, and am unsure where to go from here.

I’m 19 years old and live home with my dad. My dad is an alcoholic, and always gets drunk at around dinner time. It has been like this ever since I was a kid. I don’t understand why it’s always around dinner time. 99% of the time he is sober all the way up until dinner (at least when I’m home). I really don’t like how he becomes when he’s drunk. He’s not physically violent if conflict arises, but he can yell if it comes to it... his eyes start to get watery, he can’t pronounce words and thinks everything is funny. He basically thinks he is on top of the world and everything is just fine.

Most of the time I pretend like nothing is going on and talk to him like I normally would. Sometimes, however, I can’t... I just sit in silence and wait for him to ask what’s wrong. He knows why I become mute but he likes pressing me which really annoys me. 

When he’s not drunk we can do all sorts of activities together and we even go to the gym and play golf together. I like that good version of my dad which really conflicts me. 

Nobody in the family besides me and my sister know, and he is very good at pretending like he’s got it all under control. He also talks a lot of sh** behind my back when he’s drunk.

For the past few months I've been downing those.. Sutter Home four packs of wine daily. 
I've blacked out and woken up in utter horror that I embarrassed myself in front of friends. I often perform in plays (theatre) while intoxicated, wondering the following day how in the world I was able to remember lines or get myself together enough to act. I'm not feeling because I'm scared. I have always been able to perform,  but for some reason lately (and I'm assuming as I've aged) I have been struck with performance anxiety. The wine helps, but it's numbing.. the worst thing for an actor. 
Everything seems to hurt. I suffer from chronic pain (who doesn't) and just aged out of my mom's health insurance, I'm so afraid of everything, (including a phobia of blindness due to traumatic eye injury as a child) people scare me, I've got social anxiety and drinking helps with that, and I self sabotage. Life feels boring if I'm not messing myself up. 
I'm going to fix all of this. I just needed to vent. 
I won't drink today. I hope to God that I won't drink today. 
Hopefully I can find the contact info of the guy who found me crying at the bus stop last night and ordered me an uber.

I’m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences before. 

Something used to happen when I drank a lot and I’ve never known if this is common thing or not.

A few years ago I was going through a pretty bad rough patch, won’t go into the details but it was some messed up stuff. 
On the nights that I was emotionally distraught, I would drink my normal amount (not actually that much since during that time my tolerance was still building) and eventually would go to bed. 


It was completely different than blacking out.
I remember going to bed, I would usually remember going to sleep too, but ONLY on those nights, I would get back up at some point during the night and I guess sleepwalk. 
When I woke up in the morning I would find that things were knocked over, and almost always a suspicious wet spot on the floor....or in my bed.

I soon realized I had been either urinating on the floor or wetting the bed, and on one occasion, my sister heard me “ricocheting” down the hall, found me laying on the stairs, tried to wake me up, and just went back to bed after giving up.

Another time I burst into my mother’s room “flailing like a fish” and just...didn’t know how to get back out. 

I don’t remember these things, and I always woke up in my bed like normal. I’d also gotten significantly more drunk on different nights and had nothing of this sort happen at all.

The reason why I’m so curious is because it has recently been brought to my attention that I have some neurological problems that have apparently been there since my childhood, specifically possible (most likely) seizures.
So a lot of experiences from my past have come to light as being definitely not normal. 
For example blacking out, drug like sensations....

Not asking for any medical advice, just personal experiences.

I couldn't leave my bed and was hearing / seeing the  most DEMONIC things ever. I tried to detox at home for fear of paying for ER bills, but I just had to check myself into the hospital. When I arrived to the hospital I was even hearing whispers through the ceiling from a demonic presence. When I tell people about my experience of being in the presence of (you know who) it is as if they dont believe me or think it was just a 'hangover' , but this experience was truly terrifying and life-altering.

She’s been black out drunk 4 times this month, 3 times in less than two weeks. I’ve discovered from people that’s she’s had this issue before, and she’s always hateful towards me and never remembers anything the next day. She says things completely opposite of who I am, even her drinking “friends” say I’m such a mature young guy and great to her and for her. This last Thursday we went to a local bar and she was drinking prior when I met here there after work, and she had about 9 drinks while I was present, friends told her she needs to go home, I pull my truck up, keep in mind I’ve had one drink the whole night. I don’t drink much, alcoholism is in my family, not going down that road, I try to get her to the truck and she shoved me out of the way to get another drink. A friend of hers brought her back outside to the truck. We get to her home, she shoved me to the ground when I help her out and told me to get the fuck out of the way, it’s pitch dark and I’m shaking and anxious at this point, she ends up cooking food on a gas stove I’m next to her watching her, she eats I get her to bed... ends night... so I thought. I wake up to a crash, and btw she lives at her parents at 32 and is a bartender. Anyways her rooms lights are on and she’s nowhere to be seen, I see the back porch light on and glad door wide open, she isn’t there, I turn around and she’s face down on the ground knocked out, with the lights on, and the gas stove on high. Open flame and all, her parents never woke surprisingly, and she cussed at me and said she needed to eat, she already did... she gets back in bed. Wakes up no memory. She was blacked out drunk for over 6 hours continually, and didn’t understand why I was upset, and she’s the one who told me we need space... seriously? She says that I shouldn’t be her DD anymore and that I shouldn’t be around people that get drunk then, and that she never black out drinks... are you kidding me? She did three times in less than two weeks. And also, should I tell her parents about what happened? They saw the mess she left but are unaware of the gas stove problem.. if I decided to go home when I got her home the house could have burned down with them in it? Thoughts? 😔",3

My mom is an alcoholic. She’s getting better and not drinking as much (her and her bf were arrested a year or 2 ago after they got in a drunken fight and had to take AA type classes) but she still has many times where she just over does it. It’s been 22 years and I still don’t know how to deal with this. My dad was an alcoholic (literally died because of it) and I know that’s a big part of why she is too. Me and my sister are adults now and don’t live with her at home, but my 14 year old brother still does. Last night her and her boyfriend were drinking way too much and got into a fight. I’m not sure exactly what happened because I’m not there but my little brother texted me and told me she was upset and her bf left in the car so I called her and we talked for about an hour and I let her just vent. She seemed like she was okay towards the end of our call and was even laughing and stuff so I went ahead and told her I was going to bed (this was around 1 AM). Well around like 2:45 my sister texts me and says my mom sent her a message that said “Always remember me listening to music and loving finding something new.” Which rightfully freaked me the hell out and worried me so I called her. She kept saying how we would be better off if she wasn’t here. This is the first time I’ve talked to her like this and felt like she could truly be suicidal. She can be manipulative at times so I guess it’s possible she could’ve done this to get a reaction but it really sounded genuine and just really terrified me. My sister ended up showing up at her house while I was on the phone with her so she is safe but I just don’t know what to do. I want her to stop drinking but I mean we’ve never really done an intervention so to speak. I know she knows we don’t like her drinking so I feel like if that’s not enough for her to change her ways she isn’t going to until she’s ready. But goddamn man this hurts so much! Especially because outside of her drinking, we are best friends. I talk to my mom about everything and we hang out a lot. I hate living an hour away when things like this happen because I feel like there is nothing I can do and it’s not fair of her to do this to us all the time. I know she is sick because of the alcoholism but I just feel so worried all the time. What if next time I’m not awake? Or what if she did something with my little brother home? I just feel awful and i know she has to as well. Does anyone here have alcoholic or ex-alcoholic parents? How the hell do i navigate this??? 

Idk if it’s relevant but it’s even harder because her current bf is a raging alcoholic. she doesn’t have a job mostly due to medical reasons and he pays for everything, so she’s basically trapped there and breaking up with him would leave her with nothing. But I know not being with him is what will truly help her with her alcoholism as well. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it!

I have noticed that a lot of the people writing stories here are pretty young, i always imagined an alcohol addiction to be something for older people, or at least middle aged. A lot of the posts i see in this subreddit are from people between the age of 19 and 25.

I'm 21 years old myself and i'm from the Netherlands (where the minimum drinking age is 18), i have been dependant on alcohol for about 2 years now, as a result of a mental disorder, it started when i was 16 and i smoked my first joint. After having a lot of severe panic attacks after smoking weed, i woke up the next day in a dream-like state which, after googling a lot, i called DPDR (depersonalisation derealisation disorder). Even though i don't really feel like living in a dream anymore, i still have a lot of difficulty with sleeping.

I get panic attacks when i'm sober and trying to sleep and i just get stressed about the thought of not being able to sleep, which makes me not able to sleep. I'm going to see a psychologist in a few days and i'm trying to reduce the amount of alcohol that i consume every day (i drink every day).

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Its only happened to me once before a looong time ago when I had too much tequila (its been dubbed ""bone hurt juice"" since then) its not like the pain is bad enough to see a doctor or anything it just feels like my joints are extremely tight or like about to crack",4

I just didn’t really know where to turn too. I wouldn’t consider myself an alcoholic, at least not yet. But I think I’m getting there and I’m not sure what to do about it. 

I don’t drink every day or even super often. But the dependency is what’s there. I have a very addictive personality and smoke, have been dependent on many medications etc. And have drank a few times when I was younger, and now that I’m older it’s only gotten worse. 

At this point I don’t know what to consider myself. I don’t drink every day, but I want too, if I could drink every day I would. When I get drunk, I never want to be sober again, I cry and feel depressed when sobering up because I don’t wanna be sober. If we have booze in the house, I’ll try and steal it. If I have extra money, I wanna buy booze. If there’s booze in the house I’ll also use any excuse I can to drink and plan my days around when I can drink, I want to be drunk constantly. 

I don’t know what to do... I can’t seem to get myself out of this thinking pattern and I have nowhere to turn because if I’m not heavily drinking every day I can’t use the resources for alcoholics. So I thought maybe an online community could offer some support and guidance. 

Does it sound like I’m slipping into alcoholism? How would you get yourself out of this rut? I can’t exactly get therapy or anything, which I need anyways since I have ptsd and a slew of other mental issues. I really don’t know where to turn and I’m feeling pretty lost and am struggling to not just let myself fall into the pit and start drinking daily. 

Thanks for reading/any support",2

Usually 4hrs after but up to 12hrs after. I’ve drank for most of my life (just beer) and I’ve never had these symptoms before. Has anyone else had these symptoms ?

I’ve been taking Ativan very infrequently for symptoms, which works well, but I’m wondering if something else is triggering it. I’ve been dieting recently too, mostly lite keto.

I now live in constant anxiety of state of being arrested for state and/or federal crimes for something I didn't do.  The only way I could cope was drinking, and now I have hit a point where either I need to drink or feel debilitating levels of anxiety and pain.. as well as the shakes, insomina, and many of the other fun alcohol withdraw symptoms. 

My original doctor gave me a number to a medical detox program but due to a job change they wont take my new insurance. I have called a ton of support and services I found... but they all are basically therapy retreats that take 4+ weeks and dont actually help manage detox.... 

I dont want to drink anymore but every time I google and look for clinical resources to detox its either some no medical support program or psychiatrist that will take weeks to schedule an appointment.  I have a new job coming up in a few weeks and a family to care for I just am looking for resources to help me with the physical painful symptoms of detoxing and to try to get help and quit ASAP.

We were long distance for two years so although I couldn’t physically see him drinking I could hear it in his voice. Well I moved in with him 6 months ago and it’s something I’ve grown increasingly uncomfortable with. He has a high tolerance so it’s not like he’s a beligerant drunk but his personality changes drastically and he becomes mean. I have already expressed this to him, and cried to him about it because I come from a family of alcohol abusers. Most recently he got drunk for New Years and the night was a living hell he tried to get into a fight and was stumbling everywhere. It was bad to the point his friends were concerned. The next day I was clearly upset and he said his resolution for the new year was to stop drinking. However last weekend he ended up getting drunk at his friends.

I am a 24 year old female, currently trying to finish up college. It’s been about 2 years now that I have suffered alcohol abuse or alcoholism or binging, I truly fear labels so much and have been struggling with this that I’m at a loss.

For two years I have pushed my limits of drinking, normally alone at night. My habit started to form during a period where I was unemployed and out of school for almost a year. I never experienced an issue with alcohol until I had months of free time on my hands. I am someone who battles depression, anxiety, and mild ocd, and not having any commitments wrecked me. 

The year of struggling finding a job and moving back home passed, and I still dealt with drinking issues. It didn’t matter that I would be hungover in the morning, I would be ready to drink again at night alone after a whole day of work and working out beforehand. It sickens me how I can have a whole bottle of wine and four beers after, or 7 beers and 3 glasses of wine. Or half a bottle of vodka and beers, etc. truly just anything to get me drunk and forget my issues with myself. I feel like I cannot have just one drink, it always has to be more. I’ve never been so tired of telling myself I’m cutting back or staying sober up until the weekend and letting myself down. The amount of alcohol I’ve consumed at this age is beyond unhealthy. The amount of money I’ve spent, bottles I’ve downed and disappointment I feel are too much for me to think about- yet I always go back to wanting to drink.


I’ve been seeing a therapist for 3 years, returning for my 3rd year just recently. I’ve been going in telling her I believe I am an alcoholic, but she tells me otherwise and it’s just abuse, but can lead to being an issue if not treated. I’ve been on antidepressants for years and did have a minor kidney infection months back, which I assumed was from my consumption. Every time I say I want to stop, I get to sober day 2 and feel like all my mind can think about is alcohol, and it feels like almost a whole panic attack consuming my body by 6 pm and I always cave. I feel like I cannot simply quit drinking. Today I did not drink after drinking four days in a row and already am experiencing anxiety and a mild headache. I’m afraid I’ll experience severe withdrawal symptoms at work or during my studies, but it’s better than being hungover 4-6 days a week truly. I just want to return to being healthy, drinking responsibly and socially, not alone. Or even just quitting. I don’t want this to control my life.

Whoever reads this and can relate in anyway, just know you’re not alone.",6

Over the past 5 years I have a ton to be grateful for. My girlfriend (wife..as I refer to her) saved my life. I have 4 kids, a house (which I thought I'd never have) and good health...sort of.

These past 2 years I've really gone off the path. I can easily drink a bottle of rum in a day and I don't like who I am when I do that. I get aggressive, angry, hateful... basically the worst version of myself.
***Note: I argue with my partner but I am in no way physically or mentally abusive to her or my children.

I feel like I have the drinking under control. I never drink when I have appointments or school events to attend because I went through that embarrassment when I was younger and I can't burden my family with that. Instead, I wait until night (usually) and drink then. Often going to bed at 3 or 4 am and waking up totally drained and feeling awful.

In the past 2 years I've gained 100 lbs and feel embarrassed looking in the mirror. My career has gone stagnant and I've now gotten to the point where I need to hide my booze to not upset my partner.

I was in such a state back then, I wasn't keeping tabs on properly recovering - the only thing that made me stop drinking was being unable to get out of bed due to severe depression.

This time, I'm active and up and busy 7 days a week finding anything that can keep me away from my bed. There are days like today where I'll sleep for 15 hours because I can't face being alive, but when I do get up I try to stay up and stay busy.

Right now, however, I feel so alone. I'm so fucking lonely I don't want to live any longer. I'm not actively suicidal - I just don't want to be alive. And I don't feel like I'm alive. I'm just floating through my life waiting for I don't know what. Love? Fulfilment? Something *more* to fill the void in my heart because it's gotten so fucking deep.

Every day, more and more I'm struggling to deal with it and right now all I can think to help me is a bottle of anything. And I really need that bottle of something because soft drinks and cups of tea and coffee just aren't enough anymore.",9

In highschool I never really had many friends which at the time i was fine with but after dating this girl who was very possessive I felt like I wanted friends. She helped me get a job where I could have friends and then i started hanging out with sed friends and mostly all they did was drink and do shit. She never accepted them because we never smoked or drank when we were together so she saw it as something bad for me. We had been dating 6 or 7 years and in my eyes she was trying to keep me from anyone that wasn't her.

So i broke up with her feeling super trapped. 

I tried to live my life without her and after that finding a boyfriend who wanted to drink all the time. I tried to stop him because I saw it wasn't healthy. But he wouldn't stop. So i kept drinking with him because it was something i couldn't stop. So every day for 10 months i drank with him doing whatever he wanted. 10 months went by and i decided he wasn't good for me. I broke up with him finding out he was already talking to someone else. Trying to get over him was hard as shit but i have been doing so. 

Months later I find a boy who loves me exactly as who i am no matter what but he also likes to drink late at night (which i work early morning he works late at night) so we miss eachpther a lot but he likes to drink whem he gets off to calm down from his shift. 

I love him but (i keep telling him it's fine if he drinks because I don't want to change his daily routines) she (my ex girlfriend) has been the only person who has been checking in and she asks everyday if i have had a drink or not. I know she still loves me but that's not something i want right now. I have from my ex boyfriend become addicted to alcohol and how it makes me feel and i don't know how to get out of it. I go into work at 530am and leave at 3pm and all i want to do is take a drink and go home and nap.

Then throughout our very abusive 4yr relationship. I won’t give that the time to explain - just that it was bad, he encouraged me to drink, and I did. A lot. Since our breakup, I continued to drink heavily. 

A little about me - I have a very good job, where I’m responsible for about 50 people. Aside from occasionally coming to work hungover, my alcoholism hasn’t impacted my attendance. It hasn’t impacted my performance. At least not noticeably, somehow - I of course don’t know this for sure, but I have a very close working relationship with my peers and boss and no one has ever brought up anything. I do have depression and anxiety which I have also been upfront about with my boss, so it’s possible he could see something is up, but hasn’t brought it up to me thinking it’s not self induced. And my work results are above expectations.

Major problem is I have no friends. I lost/abandoned all of them throughout my relationship. I don’t have anyone to blame for that really, but myself. Which I’m fine with, except for that it leaves me entirely lonely now. And that’s pretty shitty. Doesn’t really give a girl many excuses to not drink, when I don’t have anything else going on, ya know?

I was able to sober up from November 10th-Christmas eve. I had some drinks with my parents. I hadn’t told them I was sober, and they knew nothing of my drinking so....just wasn’t a conversation I was ready to have.

Fast forward to New Years. I’m drinking almost daily again. I want to be sober, but I’m in that funk of “I have no one to hold me accountable” and “why bother”. I eventually get up the courage to tell my mother I’m sober. Not that I’m not currently sober, but that I had been and then we drank over Christmas, and that I wasn’t going to be drinking with them anymore.

I haven’t been able to stop since. And now I just feel extra shitty bc my parents think I’m sober. And think I’m actively making that choice. But I’m just completely failing and every day I drink and think “this doesn’t make me feel good”, but then I wake up the next morning, struggle through a day of work, get home - alone - and think about work stress and how alone I really am, and “why not” keeps wining. Even having those 6 weeks sober so so recently and so strong in my head, I can’t just get that first day.

I'm probably dumbnuts nr 200 this week asking a question of this kind. I just hope any of you could provide some insight. 

Couple of days ago I (25 f) had a work party with a lot of coworkers that I didn't know at all, save a few people I vaguely know as colleagues. We had free drinks and I've mostly drank wine the whole evening. It was a pretty boring party so I thought I just needed a bit of liquid courage to socialize better(others were going at it pretty heavily too). I can handle booze pretty well usually and I've had nights where I've had double the amount and would be heavily tipsy at most. I've had about 6-7 small glasses for as long as my memory still worked. 

Yes, I'm well aware I've been majorly retarded for drinking that amount with people that I don't know very wellI.

 I remember dancing and being fine overal, except being tipsy and all of the sudden everything goes blurry. I vaguely remember the party being over and people went outside. I couldn't walk or feel anything. I've been drunk before, but this was on a whole other level. My vision was a dark tunnel with flashes. Then I think I passed out because I faceplanted for some reason. That's when I blacked out for 2-3 hours. I ""awakened"" in the toilet of my house while my boyfriend was frantically taking care of me. Apparently I just stormed in at 2 am and ran to the bathroom. The fall had left me with cuts and bruises on my face and my shoulder hurt like hell. I then was in a pained daze on the bathroom floor unable to move while puking my guts out repeatedly. I don't remember how I got home. There's at least an hour between the end of the party and when I got home and I don't remember! I've never experienced this before. Never got shitfaced to this degree with a blackout. Maybe I've just been foolish and there's another explanation. But the way this all went down is extremely weird to me. I've felt sick for days and I'm afraid to ask colleagues, as I'm afraid for the answer. Aside from being mightily embarrassed, I'm also worried I've been taken advantage of. There's no obvious suspect and maybe nothing happened, but I can't help but speculate te possibility since there's a hole in my memory that I can't fill. Which is what scares me most. 

Only thing I could find is it possibly being GHB, which is pretty popular in this area. I don't want to accuse or point fingers. I just want to know if what I described is my own stupidity or if someone tampered with my drink. I'm hoping it's just me being a moron and I can leave this behind me with a lesson learned, but I suspect differently. So at long last. Does any of you know more about this subject?

TLDR: I think I might have been drugged at a work party, but I'm not sure.",3

I've been drinking 12 to 15 beers a day for about 5 years. She referred me to go to a hospital where they would facilitate that.

I went to the hospital and got checked in at the ER. They took my vitals and my blood sample and said since my ethonal level was low enough they would send me right upstairs to the detow room. (The whole process took 4 hours. Totally understandable on a sunday)

I got sent upstairs to what I thought was going to be the detox center that I would spend a few days to be supervised during the physical whithdwaral symptoms.


I was questioned if I had shakes which I did not
 I was asked when my last drink was which was the night before at 10 (this was about 6 the next day) then I was asked to take a breathalyzer to which I
 blew a 0.0. They then explained that I did not meet the criteria for medical withdrawal and I was recommended for outpatient treatment. I explained that my counselor who was part of this program told me to come here. I drove an hour from home to do this. I asked to speak to a doctor and was told that there was no doctor there (again understandable at 6pm on a sunday) Then right before I was about to leave they said I could stay the night and figure it out in the morning.

I felt uncomfortable and left. I contacted my counselor the next day and  I'm meeting with her tomorrow.  It was very upsetting because it was really difficult to go through the process to get help and end up feeling like no one cared.

 I also feel like when they told me I could stay the night maybe I should have. I was prepared to spend a few days I had my iPad a bunch of music I wanted to listened to. Figured it would suck pretty bad but I would keep myself busy. When they were going to admit me the told me I had to leave all my clothes and all of my things and I could get quarters for if I had to use the pay phone. All my stuff had to be locked up until I left. What the hell was I going to do for 3 days?  

No one at the recovery program I am in told me what to expect and what the process looks like. Thought I'd share my experience. It was really difficult for me and my girlfriend who came with me to go through all of that just for me to end up at home. I took 2 weeks off work to get clean. This is my first experience trying to get help. Hopefully my counselor can help my tomorrow. Sorry for the long post just wanted to share my experience.

I'm hesitant about posting this because I'm not sure if my behavior constitutes alcoholism and I don't want to offend anyone who is worse off than me. I've noticed that I use alcohol as a source of instant gratification/happiness/stress reliever on a regular basis. I've spent a couple of years thinking about why I feel compelled to drink as a way to balance myself out. My problem isn't that I binge drink, but I drink smaller amounts frequently. What bothers me is that I feel like I've lost the ability to control myself and I don't know how to cope with stress without altering my mental state with alcohol. Sometimes, after drinking while I'm laying in bed, I think really hard on why I do this. I think it's mainly out of boredom and anxiety. Most of the time the right amount of alcohol gets me to stop thinking about everything stressing me out and I feel happy. The allure is I don't have to try. I drink my drink and I feel instantly better. I rarely get hangovers because I know the right amount to drink to feel good and not bad the next day. I've had constant practice at this.

I want to be able to feel happy and relaxed without alcohol but I'm afraid I've lost the ability or willpower to do it on my own. 

Thanks for listening.",8

this comes to my problem. i have had dreams where i lost my sobriety and get called in the day. i am confused and worried in my dream because I dont remember what happened the previous night(within the dream) and feel that i lost my sobriety and then stressed because i blew it",1

So I haven't had a single drink in almost three weeks after about two years straight of drinking every day or every other day.

Well, I'm constipated now. Today I literally hurt myself while pooping, blood came out. 

Anyone else experienced something like this? How can I help my body adjust?

Thank you.",1

What the hell should I do to make him forgive me? I'm so ashamed. It's the not worst thing I've done but it's definitely not the greatest. I couldn't handle the situation when it happened because I'm too anxious and just freaked out. Now I feel like it's too late to talk about it and I should just disappear and never talk to him again. 


I'm 22 btw. I really suck at drinking. I don't like drinking. Drinking doesn't like me neither because it messes me up each time I drink (I'm kidding, I know it's my fault). Anyway, thanks for listening",1

So  a little background, 4 years ago my family and I found out that my  sibling is a severe alcoholic. They moved to a large city on their own  when they turned 18 and everything seemed to be going well for the  majority of the time they were there. That was nearly 20 years ago. Fast  forward to 4 years ago we learn that things are not going well at all.  My sibling's boss even admitted to my mother that for a full year they  were being kept on at their job unable to do anything because they were  so inebriated every day. The boss was quite good friends with my sibling  prior to that so felt a certain amount of loyalty.

My  parents and sibling both decided it would be best if they moved home  for a while, that was 3 years ago. In that time my sibling has gotten  divorced from their spouse, ran through a series of menial jobs each  time getting fired because of drinking, ended up in detox once, and  hospitalized twice. After all of this my sibling STILL refuses to even  admit that drinking is a problem. It's a level of denial that still  blows me away three years on. My sibling will drink in front of you and  tell you that they are not drinking and even become angry if you don't  believe them!  Needless to say my family is exhausted. My sibling has  been living with my parents for three years, unemployed most of the  time, in HUGE amounts of debt(the 2nd hospital stay alone cost 12 grand  and they started drinking immediately after getting out) my sibling is  also addicted to adderol and has a deadbeat partner that me and my  family hate but my sibling keeps going back to because they enable each  other and probably the partner can get other drugs which I suspect might  be involved.

Sibling refuses to  go to meetings and therapy or will go for a while and gradually stop. I  honestly have no idea what to do at this point. Are there counselors  that council families dealing with addicts that can help us figure out  what to do with them? To me the biggest barrier is that my sibling is  allowed to stay at my parents house rent free which means they never  have to get any better. On the other hand they have burned every bridge  and if kicked out would be homeless. We're all at the end of our ropes  and would appreciate any advice.

EDIT: I posted this and 15 minutes later got a message from my mother. Back in the ER...",6

Some background:

I'm currently in graduate school, so I will be in and out of my place quite often. I hardly drink, and I quit any and all drug use a couple of years ago, so maintaining a ""substance"" free apartment won't be difficult at all.

Need some support.,"He asked if he could go out for a beer - I told him it wasn’t a good idea, but that he was an adult. He’s 30 - I’m not his mother. I’ve had to disconnect myself from his choices because it’s hurt so much over the years when he’s chosen to drink, not come home, hurt himself, hurt others, verbally abuse me, etc. 

He’s finally asleep. He came home at 3:30 am telling me he needed to report his Uber driver and that he shouldn’t be as fucked up as he is. I was scared that he got drugged - turned out he wasn’t - just extremely drunk. 

He eventually started screaming at me about how fucked up the world is and getting angry (he calls it raging) about how no one gives a fuck and wants to help end all of the suffering. He kept saying “I can’t do this” over and over. He wouldn’t let me touch him. He has two guns in our bedroom and I had 911 ready to go because I was scared he was going to make a move for the one in the dresser drawer. 

After yelling at me and my part in all of this, he looked up Jeff Bezos’ net worth and freaked out about how he could be helping so many people with his money and how he’s angry that no one gives a fuck. He yelled at me that I’m the problem and that phones are the problem and then THREW his phone so hard at our bedroom wall that it’s completely ruined and the wall is damaged. 

I yawned (it’s 4:30 am now) and he got upset because to him it was a signal that I’m uninterested. He went to bed. 

I’m downstairs on the couch. I love him so much but he’s got so many issues that he doesn’t work on or try to resolve. I’m scared right now. I don’t know how to leave - and I’m scared that he will go off the deep end with drinking and in the state he’s in - hurt himself. 

I didn’t know where to put this. I needed to talk to someone but it’s 5 am where I am.

I’m sober. He keeps drinking even though he promises he’ll stop. I understand how that goes. He’s not jeopardizing my recovery - there’s no alcohol in the house/he knows better than to drink around me. 

I don’t know what to do. He’s a good person when he’s sober, but he doesn’t do anything to help the world that aligns with his misguided anger. He won’t talk to anyone. “Therapy and groups are all bullshit”. Fuck the world mentality. He’s in a dangerous place to be alone but he won’t let anyone in - and I can’t do it anymore. I’m scared. 

Sorry. Thanks for letting me post. I’m open to any advice. Any ways I can help him? I just am so lost.",6

Over the past two months I have cut my drinking down to 2-3 times per week, but still put away 10-12 beers per session.  In the last 2 weeks, I have drank 3 times, and as of this post, have not had a drink in 4 days.  

My doctor prescribed me Naltrexone, 50mg, and I've taken it once.  That one time, I took it with several other meds and I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I think I was hallucinating.  Everything looked fuzzy, almost like the A-Ha video for Take on Me.  

Is this a side effect of the Naltrexone or the combo of scripts I took?  I've been taking meds for anxiety and a pinched nerve in my back, but have never had the above experience before until I took the Naltrexone with the rest of my meds.  My pharmacist said I could take Naltrexone with the other meds and it would just increase drowsiness, but I was not expecting hallucinations.

I see posts and such on people getting really sick due to withdrawals, is the Naltrexone going to prevent this, or is it strictly to help me stay away from alcohol?

Sorry for the rant, but I'm at a point in my battle where this is the longest I've gone without a drink, and don't know how things are going to go moving forward.

Alcohol and drug use was always normalised in my family. My pa was a script head before turning a new “leaf” and becoming a stoner. My mum and step dad both functioning alcoholics. Beer as soon as they get home from work and as the sun goes down Mum switches to wine and Step dad to rum.

From about 14 they were offering me to drink with them at dinner and so forth. Of course I was 14 so I never denied them. Developed a taste for rum really early on.

Started partying early. I was ALWAYS and still am the one who was trying to push the limits. Let’s stay up a little later, get a little more fucked up, let’s try this drug or whatever.
Luckily I had a friendship group that was *fairly* tame. I mean we still partied super hard and experimented with a bunch of drugs.

It wasn’t until I left home at 18 I started drinking more and more often. My house mate was 25 and would drink a bottle of wine after work. 
Id drink with her even when I had no money, she’d offer to pay for my alcohol and like hell I would ever reject free alcohol.

She ended up booting me out of the apartment and blaming her drinking problems on me.
That’s when I moved in with my boyfriend and quit my job. 

That’s when things REALLY spiralled. I lost my apartment, my family had rejected me and I wasn’t working. Without even knowing it I became so depressed and my drinking habits became so much worse. Not only was I drinking more often but way more standards. All my money I had saved was going down with the bottle.

I couldn’t socially drink. I used to play poker every Wednesday and I’d have a few drinks with friends. Well *they’d* have a few drinks. I’d keep going and going, trying to convince them to party with me. 
I was embarrassing, I’d say stupid things, I’d do stupid things. My coping mechanism for the embarrassment? Drink to forget, create more bad memories, rinse and repeat.

I’d come home to my boyfriend and cry, scream. Become delusional, start calling my boyfriend names of people who’d abused me in the past. I’d hurt myself. 
One night when I came home and passed out, I pissed the bed. That was kinda when everyone was like OK. Get your shit together, you have a problem. But I didn’t believe them.

It got worse and worse. Until finally one party I made the mistake of a life time. 
My boyfriend booted me out the next morning. Covered in bruises with a banging headache, he drove me to my mums and he threw all my shit out of his car. 

From that day I drunk every day. I was doing drugs more often (coke, MDMA mainly) and I was enlightened to the wonderful world of bendering. I feel like once you push yourself that hard, you can’t go back to regular drinking ever again. Once you get a taste for what it’s truly like to party. Yknow?

(ps: fuck anyone who says weed is a gate way drug. ALCOHOL is the gate way drug)

I found another group of hugely dysfunctional friends. We party for days straight. I spend most of my week recovering after a 3-4 days bender. I finally found my people. Fuck we have fun though, but the price we pay isn’t worth it. 

Here are some things that have happened recently 
> My best friend got done DUI.

> One of my friends got done for break and enter, malicious damage of property. He was so fucked up he walked into someone else’s house and went to sleep thinking it was my mates.

> One friend got done driving on coke.

> My friends got into an accident after leaving my house. Reported the car stolen and got away with it.

> My friend who deals was stabbed.

>An close friend of my friend group (I didn’t know him as well as they did) was recently king hit and killed. His memorial was last night, RIP. 

It’s sad, one of us could get into some serious trouble or worse....

I’m 19, I was attractive, but I’m looking more defeated as the days go on. I’m too broke for decent alcohol so I drink copious amounts of cask wine and I will tell you, my body is paying the price. 

I did one day sober last week and it was so fucking difficult. Actually, as I write this, I remember I actually did drink that night. I made it right before bed but was so uncomfortable, shaky and anxious that I just had a glass. I’m proud I’m drinking less now at least, but I was doing 12 standards a night for months.

I remember waking up all night feeling so delirious and in sweats. 

I want to stop. I’m proud of how much I have cut down. But I don’t know if I can stop binging. I at least want to get to a point where I don’t have to drink every day.

I want nice things for myself.

I want a job, I want my health, I want a functional relationship and to be surrounded in people who genuinely care about me. Not just fucking me or getting fucked up with me. 

I don’t really know where I’m going with this but I kinda just wanted to tell my story.

I started drinking on an almost daily basis when I moved to Belgium for my studies something like 8 years ago ( I guess that's part of the culture there ). I'm rarely very drunk as I'm resistant but I'm tipsy almost every evening. I never drunk before 6pm, and if I have a bit more work to do usually not before 8pm. I never ever drink during the day.

But I drink everyday and I thought surely that's a problematic consumption? Up until recently I had to move for a week in a alternative school where they're fine with guest consuming alcohol but it's just not in their customs to drink themselves. I could have bought some and continue drinking but I was like...no, let's stop for a week to see what happens. 

And what happened was....nothing. absolutely nothing.  Did not crave it , didn't feel anything about it. I was feeling a bit more awake in the morning and that's all. So u started reading this sub and other alcohol related one's on Reddit. I do not recognize myself in the stories shared here. At all. I mean, did I often get in fights because of alcohol? Not. Not often,  not ever. Alcohol does not make me a tiny bit violent.  Does it ruins my sentimental life? No. Actually I'm mostly meeting girls in bars as my work involve working alone so I would say it's actually helping it. Do I get myself in embarassi g situation because of it? It happened at some point in my life , like anyone else. But I can't remember the last time. Not once in the past 5 to 8 years for sure. Maybe it's linked to my anxiety or the fact I'm slightly overweight but hard to say because I've always been anxious and slightly overweight,  which have been living ked by my doctors to other things I won't discus here. 

Sooooo. Yeah.  I always thought I had a problematic consumption because I'm drinking almost everyday and I've been told that's what a problematic consumption is. But actually now that I'm thinking about it....do I really have a problem with alcohol?",6

I'm 17 and don't drink. But most of my school colleagues do(of 50 in my class, 42 drink). Almost all of them are heavy drinkers. As far as I know, most of them started drinking 2 years ago. They drink twice in the weekend and once or twice during the week. And they drink heavily. Generally until some among them starts blacking out.

Would this qualify them as alcoholics?
I suppose it is not easy to know when someone is an alchoholic, but is it possible or probable that they are?

How should I deal with them?
Generally when I meet them, they are sober. I don't speak with them very much, for almost all of them that were my friends stopped being when they started to drink. I still worry for them, however. How should I deal with them generally? Is there something I could do to try to change something on them to the better?Treatment is out of question, for they have not yet felt the bad permanent effects of alcohol and they keep it secret from their parents.

Would you recomend that someone don't start to drink?

I was watching the Patriots vs Titans game at a bar alone because I couldn’t get it to stream on my tv. I’m a 29 year old female and I am fairly sociable. I ended up making some new acquaintances and having several drinks with my new found fellow Patriots fans. I remember being at the 1st bar after the game and then things get really hazy. I know I walked next door to the other bar and then the night is lost. I have about 8-10 hours of unaccounted time. I know there was another bar after that because of transactions on my bank card. I have no receipt for an Uber or Lyft. I woke up the next morning in my apartment with no memory of getting there, with an opened condom wrapper on my night stand. There was a condom in my trash can but it looked like it had been put on but not really used if you know what I mean. Physically it did not feel like I had intercourse in that blackout period. I also woke up with a big bruise on my knee, bloody knee cap, and an extremely painful elbow, meaning I had a pretty hard fall that I obviously don’t remember.

The blackout I experienced was slightly terrifying and I know I am lucky because that stranger could have done whatever they wanted to me and I would have woken up with no idea who they were. I still don’t know who this guy was, but I’m glad he made the decision to not completely take advantage of me.

I did not drink last night, thank you to all the responded on here. I really took the advice. It was definitely hard because I had family over for a small birthday party for my daughter and everyone was having a glass of wine. What I noticed was everyone had 1-2 glasses, where as if I normally participated, I would have had 5 or more, which really opened my eyes. The only problem was that I couldn’t sleep last night (insomnia has always been an issue of mine before the alcohol)  I intend to stay dry, does anyone have any recommendations on what to take at night to help sleep, especially when in the easily steps of detox?  I didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms last night luckily besides the insomnia Luna which I think I really started drinking so much in the first place.


All,

I have been drinking almost every night since I started college. I have graduated almost 5 years ago and can barely remember almost any nights I’ve been without alcohol in YEARS. I do not wake up and drink and typically will only drink after like 6 or 7.  I black out a few nights a week and don’t remember going to bed (i don’t do anything irresponsible like drink and Drive or start fights). I end up drinking a lot because work has always been so demanding ( construction sales). I always tell myself I’m going to have a few drinks so that I can sleep, but I and starting to think that is just a lie I tell myself.

Me and my friend used to binge drink together years ago in our early 20's. Since then I seemed to learn moderation, and moved on/moved to another state 500 miles away. We still talk on the phone several times a week so were still pretty close.

My friend still lives at home with his parents. His dads an alcoholic too so I think they're far to desensitized to the whole thing. He will go through short 3 day burst of not drinking(probably cause hes broke) and then go right back to drinking 7+% IPAs. Like multiple days in a row. Like drinking through hangovers which blows my mind. Getting wasted and driving all over town.

I'm afraid he's going to get a DUI or diabetes or something since hes a heavier dude, and his dad has that as well. Almost more than that I'm afraid that the drinking is emotionally stunting him, and hes never going to grow up, and move out of his parents house, and get a girlfriend. Generally just never mature into an adult.

How can I bring my concerns up to him without seeming like I'm judging him, or how can i help give him the tools to help himself. Any time I seem to approach the topic he starts to get really defensive. So I just back off, but I think It's getting to a point that I need to do something. Any advice?",1

She called an ambulance and I went to the ER and then was in the psych ward for 2 weeks. I want to offer my managers an honest and complete explanation without sounding like I'm making excuses or saying anything weirdly personal or tmi (I don't have the best social skills). Wondering if I have a good balance. If you need more context feel free to read my last post.

**Apology:**  

I want to apologize for what happened a couple weeks ago, and thank you for getting me the medical attention that I needed. I made a very bad decision that I deeply regret, and I'm sorry. I don't want to make any excuses because I know there is no justification, but I do want to be honest and offer an explanation and a sincere promise that I am committed to making sure that nothing like this ever happens again. I have been dealing with depression since middle school and an anxiety disorder called selective mutism my whole life. I never got treatment for either of them until now, and I developed some terrible coping mechanisms like self harm and binge drinking. Being alone during the holidays and so much of the break made me feel even worse and it got out of hand. I came into work drunk from three days straight of drinking and even brought more alcohol with me. It was a stupid decision, I don't know what I was thinking.

I'm sorry that I let my personal issues interfere with my work and for any fear or concern that I caused. I should have asked someone for help before it went this far, but I am now doing everything I can to prevent it from happening again. After the emergency room, I was hospitalized for about two weeks in the psych ward, and it helped me a lot. Now that I am out of the hospital, I will be regularly meeting with a therapist and a psychiatrist and working on healthier coping skills. I have also started taking medication for depression and anxiety instead of self-medicating with alcohol. I am truly sorry, and I hope that in time I can regain some of your trust.",3

I went through horrible withdrawal and tried to straighten up with the help of my doctors. I did get better but I wasnt clean. I went from handles to a fifth a week. Then I got down to a fifth maybe every other week, if that. Holidays came around and my alcoholic brain made it an excuse to drink and I fell back in the rabbit hole. 

The worst thing about my addiction is i have really bad anxiety. I was diagnosed long before i had an addiction. When i couldnt see my dr anymore, i used alcohol to dilute the world and make things easier. It worked for a while. But then, my hangovers werent just headaches and nausea. They were severe anxiety that landed me in the hospital with gastritis, withdrawal, hallucinations, nightmares and panic attacks.

I continue to drink through the typical holiday events and it lead to my rabbit hole. I had a few drinks and I was fine the next day but was slightly hungover. I'm sure most of you know the ""hair of the dog"" trick. So I tried. I took 3 shots and cut myself off. That night I fell back again. I was afraid to go to sleep. I felt like when I started to drift, I was dying. Like my heart would stop or I'd forget to breathe. Its almost like restless leg syndrome but its your whole body and your brain. 

I have successfully gone a couple weeks without alcohol. But I had so much stress at the time, tonight I decided I'd drink a little. I only bought a fifth and I have no intention of drinking all of it or even drinking again anytime soon. 

My fiance got mad and went to stay elsewhere. Understandable. Hes the one that's had to take me to the hospital and hold me at night while I cry and thrash because not only am I angry at myself, but he doesnt want to watch me kill myself. 

I just dont know how to stop. I do so well for long periods of time but I always go back. Even when I'm literally afraid I wont wake up. I'm scared. I dont want to lose him. But I also dont k ow how to give it up. I'm trying so hard. But it's like being hungry for days. The thirst is here. The withdrawal may have stopped but that craving wont go away.",2

So, my other half have broken up and got back together a few times and generally had a massive rocky patch, through things out of our control like family bereavement etc.he has always like saying drink but at the moment it’s worrying me and he won’t listen to me, just brushes me off,  gets mad or says he’ll only have one which we all know is never the case. Since Friday night just gone he’s been through a almost 6 bottles of vodka in just under a week. He drinks during the day If he’s at home and he drinks straight when he comes home from work, first thing he does is have an alcoholic drink.

. It’s completely changed his personality - when drunker is literally like a different person -  he shouts vile things at me, will rant for ages about stuff and alll my shortcomings and how generally shit I am, etc. It used to really upset me but now I ignore and go to bed. He still gets up for work the next day but often complains of feeling hungover (well duh) since he drinks up to a full bottle of vodka a night.. 

Is he what you’d term a functioning alcoholic? 

When I tackle him about it, as obvs it worries me, he shuts me down straight away and says I’ll only have one but we all know it’s never just one is it. 

Advice? I’ve tried to get him to go to help, won’t go, and calls me in denial when he is in denial about how his health is going to be if he carries this on, let alone the money he spends on £20 bottles a time in an average week. 

At what point does one become an alcoholic  as I am coming to the view that maybe, just maybe, his could be one of those ‘high functioning alcoholics’

Ex has the gene, father is an alcoholic, I watched her mother almost drink herself to death a few times, and her sister is 6 years sober. We've been divorced for over 3 years a d had no idea her alcoholism kicked in until last June when she suddenly checked into rehab for 10 days.

I never once thought about getting full custody with the kids because:
   1. I don't want our daughters (7 and 10) to not be able to see their mom regularly
    2. I feel it would only hurt my ex mentally and cause her to drink more often

Since she got out of rehab she has relapsed twice (that I know of), the second time was on the last day of school before Xmas break. She called me that day and said she had broken up with her boyfriend and was in bad way(she was sobbing). She was on her way to pick up our girls. I told her to stop by my place and I'd cook dinner.

When she arrived she reaked of beer. Halfway through dinner I went out to her car and there was an open container. She picked are kids up from school drunk.

I waited for the kids to go to bed to talk with her. I told her that was strike 2 and strike 3 was me getting full custody. I felt like she knew the gravity of the situation.

A week passed and she started out patience rehab, 3X a week. Last Friday she calls me at 2PM, sobbing, and I eventually got her to admit she was drunk. She was scheduled to pick up the girls that day.

It is also very long, so I have bolded the most important part towards the bottom.

**TLDR: Went to work black out drunk & passed out in the locker room. Manager found me unconscious with self-inflicted cuts on my arms from before work and called an ambulance. Got stuck in psych ward for 2 weeks without access to my phone to call in, explain, or apologize. Got discharged from hospital and have not been contacted by my workplace about what happened.**

I’m a 21 y/o college student working at a restaurant on campus. I live in an apartment with 4 other students. All of my roommates and pretty much everyone else I know left for winter break, but I didn’t because my relationship with my family is terrible. The restaurant where I work was closed for a lot of the break, so I was just alone in my apartment most of the time getting increasingly depressed and lonely (I hate being alone, even for a short time). I was off work for about a week from Christmas through New Year’s, returning to work on January 2nd. This was the longest period without at least a few hours out of the apartment and with other people. Loneliness and depression are pretty common feelings for me anyway, and being alone in my apartment for so long especially during the holidays made it a lot worse.

I started drinking more and more to deal with it, telling myself I was “celebrating” the holidays. But for some reason on New Year’s eve I was less depressed and actually kind of happy. I started drinking that night, but I really was just celebrating this time as I watched the ball drop on TV like I do every year and was actually having a good time, right up until exactly midnight. Then out of nowhere I just started sobbing. I didn’t even fully know why at first, but seeing all those people on TV, happy and smiling with people that love them and knowing I don’t have any of that just broke something inside of me.

I don’t remember a lot after that, but I kept drinking for a while and then went to bed. I couldn’t fall asleep so I got up and kept drinking and I just didn’t stop. I was drunk all of New Year’s day and kept drinking all night again. If I slept that night it was only a couple hours. I have been self-harming and suicidal off and on since middle school, never getting help for it, and in the morning on January 2nd, I cut my arms with a razor blade. I had been doing a lot of painting during the break, a more healthy way I sometimes deal with my emotions, and I started another painting that morning, but this time I painted with my own blood. And I was still drunk, for the third day, and I kept drinking, and suddenly it was time to go to work.

I blacked out and only remember parts of what happened next. I remember realizing it was time to go to work and getting ready. I brought more alcohol with me, but I don’t remember actually drinking once I was at work. I don’t remember leaving my apartment or the trip to work, but I do remember when I first got to work. I clocked in and started working for a bit and then went to the bathroom. I may have passed out in the bathroom for a while but I don’t remember for sure. The last thing I remember is deciding to go get my pocket knife from my coat pocket in the locker room and continue cutting in the bathroom. Then suddenly I woke up on a stretcher; I don’t know if I was still at work or somewhere in the hospital. Someone asked me, “Do you know where you are?” and I shook my head no. They then asked, “What’s the last thing you remember?” and I responded, “I was painting.” I asked who called them, confused about who could have found me when I was alone in my apartment.

**They explained that my manager found me unconscious in the locker room with cuts on my arm and that I had alcohol with me, and then I remembered that I had been at work. I said some nonsense about my brother, and then woke up somewhere else, in the hospital in restraints. I ended up getting sent to the psych ward for about two weeks, and wasn’t allowed to use my cell phone or the internet while there. I was supposed to have another shift on the 3rd that I missed since I was in the hospital. I got discharged from the psych ward yesterday and have had no calls, voicemails, or emails from any of my managers about this. What should I say to them? How do I apologize/explain and ask about the status of my job? I am not taking classes this semester, which started this week, because I have to do an internship instead as a graduation requirement, so I wouldn’t be working there this semester anyway, but I would like to return after my internship is over. I didn’t realize how much I liked this job and the people there until now. I hate that I made such a stupid decision and possibly lost not only the job but the respect and trust of my managers and coworkers.**",9

2020-01-16 13:06:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/epn0tz/moment_of_clarity/,Moment of Clarity,"Sooo i just wrote a really long fucking inspirational post and accidently hit back and lost it.  So long story short:

I had a moment of clariry today.  Day 4 no alcohal after I went on a bender that resulted in such a bad hangover i puked so much i lost my voice (not the first time thats happened im a puker). I started off just a 3 day break get it out of my system then drink moderately ( lie ive told myself  many times).  But I was out for coffee today and normally when im out i look at people and wish I could be living  a normal fulfilling life like them. But today when I had that thought I stopped and thought I am I am like them!  I have an amazing life its just my addictions that are pulling me down and making me feel that way. 

 So on the way home i cried! (I dont usually express emotion like that unless im drinking) I cried for the younger me the experiences she missed out on and the insecirities and anger she felt.  How she couldnt deal with her emotions how she was numb througout her whole college experience! But i cried happy because i know if i had smartened up and sobered up at 15 when it was first a problem (im 27) 12 of the fucking prime years of life numbed but I'm still happy cause I wouldnt be where im at today.  I would have continued with engineering.  I wouldnt have my amazing job at Sequoia National Park and my amazing Nigerian boyfriend. (Bragging i know lol). But now i like where i am i think i wanna stay so i wanna try and quit for good! 

 He has expressed his concerns about weed and alcohal use and i know i will eventually lose him if i dont quit! And as i work in trails alcohal is prevelant and forgiven often but im still on a path to making huge mistakes at work if i dont sober up. I cry happy knowing something is different this time at least i fucking pray it is! Its only day 4 and i am taking it day by day but i feel so good about it today i just wanted to share! After i accidently deleted my first post (which was much better i promise) I almost just said fuck it. But i wanted to share this feeling. Because  I think  Its really because of others sharing their stories on this page and the one for quitting weed that i feel stronger this time.  

I hate the labels of addict and alcohalic.  I was terrified of going to AA (im not religious) or even other groups cause i thought going in ment this is it no more and that thought terrified me.  ( ive known ive had a problem for a while but only really tried to stop and moderate in the last 2 years).  Combing through this page reading all the scary,sad, inspirational stories has given me that sense of community and higher power i was too scared to seek elsewhere. So thank you guys! Keep it up!",3
2020-01-16 11:14:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eplfaj/its_frustrating_even_to_post_here/,It's frustrating even to post here,"and that opinion comes from both arrogance and stubbornness. I definitely didn't want to post this on my main (only) account, but fuck it, it's just the internet. I mean no disrespect to all of you that have endured much worse than I have, but I think I actually might have a problem.

I've always drank heavily, but it was never an issue. Within the last 3 or so years I've started drinking by myself, which was something I never used to do -- it's been very slowly cumulative. I've always loved my heavy-ass beers (fucking Lagunitas and their 9+% brews), buy that eventually progressed to 375 ml bottles of liquor, to more than half of a fifth when I drink.

It's not consistent, it's actually somewhat haphazardly sporadic -- I'll kill 2 fifths within 3 or so days by myself and then I won't drink for anywhere between a week or a month or so, just out of principal -- because I don't want to feel like an alcoholic. I've never dealt with physical withdrawal symptoms (again not trying to trivialize what a lot of you I'm sure have gone through, just stating my anecdotal experience). But I keep coming back to it, without fail within the last 3 or so years. It's a strong psychological addiction for me. When I do drink it's never in moderation, like I said recently probably an average of 2/3 of a fifth a day.

I know my experience is probably much different than some of yours, and honestly I don't know what I hoped to glean out of this post -- it might have been more cathartic than anything.

I guess I'm just open to any suggestions, advice, or just dialogue.",2

2020-01-16 08:04:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/epj268/need_advice/,Need advice,"Hi! I’ve been reading posts here for a while and finally decided to make an account to post on. 

My story:
I have had a problem with alcohol for about 10 years now. It started when I turned 18 and started hanging out with an older crowd that partied a lot. I had a pretty sheltered life growing up so I would never have believed back then drinking would become a problem for me.. it started with just beer and the occasional fifth of something nasty and cheap everyone would laugh about. It moved onto wine which I think allowed the problem to grow while being disguised since consuming a few bottles of wine is seen as more socially acceptable than a 30 case of beer. 

In the beginning it was all about being social when I had almost no social skills. I could come up with funny things to say when it took so much effort to make simple conversation without drinks. Another thing was I had all these ideas (not all of them that great once I read them in the morning) that would just erupt in my mind. This lead to me drinking alone when I would get a chance. I think the problems became concrete when my first relationship ended and the only thing I could do to stop the pain was just drink. This was when I just turned 21 btw... I was also in college at the time so it was easy to mask stuff with a flexible schedule. I started skipping classes and dropped out for a while to regain control. It subsided finally but it never really went away. I would go 2-3 weeks with no alcohol then randomly binge a night.

Long story short I went back to school, and majored in IT. Fast forward to now 3 jobs later I have a really nice job with flexible hours at a software company but this problem is still with me. The reasons I used to drink before all are gone and I do it now just to feel some excitement while I play video games and then it continues for the next day or two... the problem is now I have a lot more money and a flexible work from home schedule so it’s never been easier to cover it up. However I suspect I’m having digestion problems and sometimes feel discomfort in my right side after a binge which is where my liver is. I can still stop for 2 weeks at a time but it’s becoming more frequent and the recovery times are getting longer. I’m afraid. 

I also forget all the negative things that have been caused by drinking in the past before I am about to binge. It’s weird it’s like I’m just sitting in a ride watching my life as I head to the party store when everything rational is telling me not to do it. It’s uncanny too because I won’t get urges if I know it’s impossible for me to drink without causing some big problem. It’s like that part of my brain is able to out think me. I’m afraid of losing my job if I try to take time off for recovery. I live at my parents. I’ve moved out a couple times but still end up there because things become too much. I just wish I could reboot everything and get rid of the urges. 

At this stage I’m just looking for advice.",2

I’ve tried to tackle this demon on my own for about a year now and have failed over and over. 

Being pregnant helped me realize that maybe I don’t completely have an issue because I didn’t drink a sip for the 41 weeks but jumped right back in the day I got home from the hospital.

My (F19) partner (M20) and I have been together for nearly 2 1/2 years. Since we started dating his dad has sunken into a deep depression that involves intense alcoholism. 
My partner and his brothers (20 & 17) have tried so much to help him. Every time we go over to his house for dinner he gets drunk and goes into a deep depressive zone that my bf has to deal with. We rarely actually have dinner. 

My bf isn’t a talker, so I’m kept in the dark about quite a lot of the day to day details of his dad’s life, but I know it’s not going well. 
People his dads age are having a go at my bf and his brothers for not doing enough, and for not loving their father endlessly, despite having no idea how much time, effort and stress the boys put into helping their dad. 

Basically i guess I’m trying to ask, how can I support my bf and his brothers through all this? I’m a talker when it comes to emotions and stress, so to have my bf be the complete opposite has me at a loss. I’m worried about their dad and them, but eometimes my bf will snap at me or crack it at me for asking how they’re all doing, which is understandable because he’s stressed about it, but it means I don’t know how else to help him.

What kind of external support helped you through it all, whether being the child of an alcoholic or a former alcoholic yourself.

TL:DR My BFF is an alcoholic. I need help from people who have been there, so I can help her.

About 18 months ago, my best friend ""N"", ended a bad relationship with someone emotionally abusive. She replaced him with another emotionally abusive person. About 10 months ago, she hit what I would call rock bottom. N had to drop out of a prestigious graduate program, and wallowed in her issues by drinking more and more. At the end of May, N was facing homelessness and coped by mixing alcohol with some Benzos.... then went driving. Luckily she hit a pole and nothing/no one else. She called me to pick her up from the hospital, without telling me why she was in the hospital. When I found out I was livid. However, I still helped her pack up her apartment, and moved her into my family's spare room.

Due to her DUI she is supposed to go to diversion. She is supposed to not drink, no drugs, weekly pee tests, etc.  She hasn't moved forward with some of these steps and uses fake urine when needed.

Fast forward. I went on vacation for the holidays with my family, when we came back, my husband found a rolled up dollar bill and a burn mark from a neglected cigarette on our patio shelf. When we found this we spoke to N. We let her know that this was going to be a sober house, no more alcohol or weed this was 12/29/2019, and that this is such a breach of trust and would not be tolerated. N stated that due to long term alcohol abuse she couldn't just stop drinking, she needed to wean off to limit withdrawals. My husband and I were okay with this. We purchased her alcohol and for over 10 we tapered her off.   She hit 2 days alcohol free, though she did smoke a bowl here and there for anxiety and shakes.

N said she was going to the gym for a fitness class on Monday. I offered to pick her up at 7pm after class, she refused. She went and saw abusive boyfriend and went drinking and smoked weed. Then came back at 11pm. She was honest and told us, but my husband told her, ""we cannot even trust you to go to the gym.""  I followed saying that she needs help and this can't keep happening, that we have opened up our home to continue to be taken advantage of. I restated that this house will no longer tolerate this. My husband and I left in anger and went to go to bed. She left.

She refuses to call me all day yesterday. She sent me cryptic texts though.  I have called every person I know in connection to her and couldn't find her yesterday. The texts and conversations I had lead me to think she may be suicidal.  At 1am this morning she called me from a private number screaming that I left her on the side of the road, in freezing weather without shoes, and took her phone/purse, an hour away from my house. THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN AND IS NOT TRUE. N asked for her mom's # and her exes's numbers, which I provided. She has yet to contact me back.

So here is were I need advice. Do I let her back? What do I do? How can I help her?

EDIT: She called and is coming here. She is currently parked across the street, not sure what to do when she comes inside.",3

I’ve been a heavy drinker for the last couple years due to college. I was in a fraternity that often saw me drinking heavily minimum 3x a week ranging all the way to 6x a wk. The goal was usually to get as drunk as possible every time because I had social anxiety and I thought it helped. However I wouldn’t-consider myself dependent and only drank in social situations. Never alone. Around my Junior year I started experiencing weird hangover symptoms that I at first attributed to getting older, but it seemed like something more. They involved extreme bouts of anxiety and depression to the point were I couldn’t leave my bed and my body felt off. This only happened if I had drank in extreme excess the night before or heavy for 3 or more days prior, if it was just one day I was fine.

Fast forward to my senior year and I am now getting these more frequently were my body felt off, and I was hit with insane bouts of anxiety. But it got really bad after one particularly heavy wknd of drinking. I woke up that day feeling horrid, completely nauseated, anxiety, shakes. I was incredibly nauseous and tried making myself throw up. After this I couldn’t stop throwing up for the rest of the day probably over 20times. As soon as anything touched my stomach extreme naseau. The worse part lasted about a day but I didn’t feel fully recovered for another 2-3 days.

This year I graduated and went back to visit for a big day long drinking event. I had not been drinking significantly since I graduated a couple months prior, maybe once every couple weeks. Went up for the weekend and drank everyday and on the day of the event, I consumed pedialyte in the morning and ate breakfast and lunch. Although I didn’t eat dinner and drank little to no water all day. Spent the whole day drinking non stop also. The next day driving back the same thing from before starts happening I initially woke up with the shakes. Feeling depressed and nauseous. Felt worse as the day went on and got food. Food didn’t help made me more nauseous. Got to the point where I could barely move or talk to not get sick. When I got home I started throwing up and couldnt stop like previously but this time it was way worse. I felt like my body was shutting down, im not sure if I was delirious as this was a while ago but I remember feeling like I was going to have a seizure or something was going to happen( even though I had nvr experienced one before). Very confused and out of sorts. It got so bad I thought I was gna have to go the hospital. Thought I’d feel better after 2days but still felt like shit for 5 days.

So I basically want to know if anyone has experienced something similar or knows what is happening. After researching the closest thing I found to my symptoms was withdrawal, but I thought this is only the case when you’ve been drinking everyday over a long period. Is this just some weird hangover. Please help.

Also note I know this is a sign I should cut down regardless. But I still want to be able to go out and drink with my friends. Now that college is over I don’t go out nearly as much, and I only drink at social settings. But sometimes I’m scared if I overdo it one night this will happen.

Edit It felt completely different from any hangover I’ve ever had.",2

When i give up the booze my body goes through some changes one reoccurring painful one is pain in my lower intestine, originally i was diagnosed with diverticulitis. But after colonoscopy their is no evidence of that, i read up about the leaky gut syndrome and it fits my other symptoms like a glove but its unrecognised and google aint the best place to learn to play doctor. 

Does anyone else suffer when they sporadically quit long term small amount (under 6 standard a day) alcoholism, have lower abdominal pain on your left flank, specifically near the pelvic bone but the whole lower intestine is in pain.

One night my mom was out, and I was with my friend. My mom had told my friend not to come over because I was asleep, my friend proceeded to come over while my mom was at work. She had came to my window and opened it and yelled my name. I unlocked the door and said wtf why r u here I was asleep. I had told my mom she came over. My mom was more than P-I-S-S-E-D so my friend was freaking out and said why would u tell her, I said I didn’t think it was a problem? So then my mom was supposed to be home at 10:49 pm ish, she works late. 11:00 hits I said oh maybe there’s traffic or an accident. 12:00 hits, I call my grandma who lives right next door.. she had no word about my moms whereabouts. Then I had spammed my moms phone til about 12:30 she finally picked up... My mom had answered and was slurring her words badly (My mom has drank consistently 90% of my life) so I was asking where she was and why she was drunk, she said because she wanted to (as all moms say) I’m the adult I do what I want! Then I ask who she’s with because I can hear her laughing, she yells A MOTORCYCLE GANG! I’m like.. this bitch tweakin there’s no way. Suddenly the phone transferred to a random man who said AYY WE takin’ care of ya mother don’t worry darlin, then the phone switches to another man and basically asks how old I am. I was obviously pissed and scared for her, I was cursing at all these strange men. I had a panic attack and handed the phone to my friend. I started hyperventilating. My friend was yelling at the men and then came to me to see if I was okay. I had called my grandma after and told her everything that happened. We decided to call again and she wasn’t answering, we had probably called her 60 times and she wasn’t picking up. We called my grandma back and let her know she wasn’t answering, my grandma suggested she try calling. She had told me my mom didn’t answer. We all decided to call the cops. We had been waiting for about 30 minutes so by the time we called it was 1:00 am.  We called the cops and they showed up. They questioned us and asked where she may be. My friend was saying WAY too much, she was telling them that my mom drinks a lot 24/7.  My grandfather was there with us and was trying to intervene to get my friend to stop talking. I told them she goes to some bars and looked on her previous Facebook posts of where she liked to go. And it was about 2:30 am when my mom had decided to pull in the driveway. She was so drunk. Basically it’s my house first and my grandparents, she passed my house seeing all the flashing lights and cops and still decided to pull in. ( she pulled into my grandparents drive way and it leads to our driveway) she could have drove by and avoided it. So she pulls up and says whattt is happeeeenning (best I can describe her slurs) then she asks if my dog is okay and that’s why they’re here. Immediately they can tell she’s intoxicated. Basically we were sent inside and the cop comes in and says ur mom wants to know if the dog is okay. I was in utter shock that she’s worried about the dog and not me. I broke down crying and asked if he’s serious and that’s the first thing she said to them and he said I’m so sorry. I said tell her the dogs perfectly fucking fine. He leaves and tells her. From my POV it looked like my mom was resisting arrest. My papa came in and told me she was. But apparently she says she wasn’t. She had been released shortly after. Once she got home she started getting in my friends face. Then I had stepped in front of her and told her to stop and she was making a fool of herself. She was still slightly intoxicated. Fuck the cops for not releasing her when she was sober. Basically my mom had started punching me and grabbing my hair, she had kicked me in my stomach. My grandpa saw all of this 
Basically I was standing in front of the couch and she was standing right in front of me and kicked me so from behind my mom he couldn’t see her kick me. Bizarre that he couldn’t. The last time she beat me like this it was thanksgiving eve because she potato’s were not peeled and she had tried to strangle my dad and hurt me. But anyways back to this, I had never stood up for myself and fought back before. So I had grabbed her hair and started fighting her back. I had broke her glasses and pushed her into her room. I didn’t want my friend to see this. So we were fighting in her room, she was dirty fighting and kicking me like a little bitch. I had pushed her into the floor and she had fell a bit too so thank god she did. And then she got up and pushed me against the wall and was being horrible and backing me up into a corner, I thought I was gonna die right there. My papa ( grandpa) came storming in and thankfully told her to get off. My grandpa was just yelling and trying to get her off earlier but my moms really strong. Then I went into the my room and mom came in and goes I’m gonna kill u, then she goes oh I thought u were —— (my friend) I go I’m not but ur not gonna touch her, her dads literally a cop. I had followed my mom to my friend and once again here we are. I convinced her to get away and to not start more problems.  She was screaming I WANT THESE LITTLE BITCHES OUT!  Then my papa took me and my friend to her house to drop her off. Once my friend got home she called cops and told them what she did to me. I had told her not to. On our way back to my house my mom was on a different road and was caught by the cops. I was yelling papa that’s mom! We had driven past once again and we were right. The head cop idk what they’re called came to me and started screaming at me DID SHE KICK U. I was crying the whole ride and could barley talk. I ignored him, his tone intensified, DID YOUR MOTHER KICK YOU?! I said YES. They asked if I needed an ambulance and did she leave any bruises I said no. There was no bruising. They didn’t arrest her and she agreed to be quiet and okay for the night. They told me I could not be in the house. Basically I had to live with my dad, 2 weeks later I was back home and it was okay. 



NOW- 
My moms getting her license taken away and idk what to do she’s blaming my friend because they have it on camera, my friend saying a bunch of shit. Apparently they wouldn’t have taken away license if she didn’t say everything she said.  My friend and I have had our ups and downs but we’re trying to get better.  I know everyone must be thinking my moms a piece of garbage but I do love my mom, she’s so different sober. She’s caring, she’s an animal lover, we do fight but it’s normal, she’s my mom. My moms been though a lot, she’s been raped. She opened up to me awhile ago, I’ve had a really bad experience with a man before aswell. So she’s kind of understanding of that. I love my mom she’s the best thing I have. But I don’t know what to do I really wanna be in my friends life and her to be in mine. But today it was declared she’ll lose her license for 2 years. Because she’s had a previous dui. We might have to move in with grandma because her job may find out about dui and fire her. Or she may not get rides to work. I’m trying to get my GED because school wasn’t for me, I was suicidal 24/7. School made me miserable, basically everything’s depending on her license. Idk what to do. Please help.

2020-01-13 22:45:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eofr8i/leaving_a_alcoholic/,Leaving a alcoholic,"On December 26, 2019 I made the very difficult decision to leave my girlfriend of one year due to her drinking. I had been with this woman for one year. We met in January 2019 on MLK day via a dating app.  Before I said hello to her I knew I found my one (thought so) as I walked in the restaurant. It was a magical connection. Within the first 2 weeks there were a couple of minor incidents. One was when people from the lighting industry came to Denver for a holiday event, she had gotten so drunk the night before she had to Uber to my place the next day and have me coddle her. A week later, she went to Vegas for 36 hours. Landed in Denver at 3:00 pm and stumbled to my apt absolutely lit up drunk and non functioning. All within 2 weeks.

I thought hmmm but hey it’s early don’t judge. February was the after work drinks of vodka and soda. About 3-5 per night but each pour was easily 3-4 shots of vodka. A gallon would be consumed every 3 days and sometimes 2 days. At this point I was becoming concerned. I loved her by now and thought maybe a loving relationship that wasn’t like her marriage might perhaps open her eyes up to reaching her pinnacle with me. For weeks I told her I needed her to take me to the airport in March in the morning for a flight to Florida. Sadly, expecting the worst, I made a backup plan with my 21 year old student I taught at the hospital I was working at.  Sure enough, she drank so much she was unable to take me. At this point I was ready to walk and regrettably did not.

I believed in her and the power of love. By this time we moved in together and there were many great times but the drinking continued. I had plans as a newbie to Denver to try a few restaurants and concert venues. She nearly passed out at Wicked at the performing arts center. Could barely walk and people were staring at her. I was to embarrassed to look up. The night before at red rocks we saw a prince tribute by the Colorado symphony ruined before we got the by her drunk and being super overly friendly with the Uber driver. Awful. Several lunch and dinner dates ruined by her drunk at 1:00 pm once and most dinner dates trashed before we got there. I’m in tears as we speak writing this.

Last incident I’ll share amongst (hundreds mind you)the many; we’re the hallucinations in the middle of the night thinking I was face timing other women at 2 am. Mind you I wake at 4:30 am for work and often these hallucinations led to arguments and me going to work on 2-3 hours sleep for my 12 hour shift. Other incidents accusations of me hiding her phone and iPad or me responsible for finding everything from her hair brush, acrylic nails to car keys. Her sleep was AWFUL and I paid the price for it being kept up. Several times she would forget her purse or sunglasses at restaurants and places. It never ended for me. I had no help with the house, dishes, laundry and cooking. I began to lose myself. I no longer wanted to go out. I stayed in fearing her drunk. I would tell staff and her hair stylist to not serve her as much when we would show up and she got livid at me for that. I became a shell of myself. I fell into deep depression and became angry punching doors no less. I never did that. I saw the love of my life falling into the abyss and me no longer caring.  Her daughter lived full time with her birth father. I caught my gf apologizing to her one night for not seeing her because she was hungover and admitting to her that she’s sorry for doing that again. So there’s more there I wasn’t aware of or how deep this issue was.

After 2.6 years in Denver I packed up and moved to St. Louis to get as far away from her and Denver. I hated Denver after her. Ruined my dreams and vision I had there. A happy home. A great partner and a future filled with endless opportunities. 

Why do I feel so miserable and guilty like I quit? For fucks sake I feel so lonely and depressed. I’m 47, in shape, educated and a huge heart. She was 45 and a sales professional. I wake up thinking about her all day all night hoping for a miracle that she will quit drinking after losing me and will search for me again, I feel like hell and I can’t stop crying, this really changed me. Any advice? Why the guilt? Why the love? Why the hoping someday again? Appreciate it.

2020-01-13 19:20:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eod31l/a_story_about_second_chances/,A story about second chances,"This is my story of how much of an idiot a single person can be.

I'm writing this from the seat next to my hospital bed. Enjoying a rich tea biscuit and coffee. The amount of guilt and remorse over my nieveity is completely overwhelming. So much that I am actually crying. 

I'm here because I have a serious problem with alcohol. I've always known it, yet despite this knowledge, I persist with going through the cycle of binge drinking to the point of almost annihilation, hitting the depths of crippling withdrawals, where I'm physically incapable of even standing. I go through a painful recovery, vowing to never drink again. I'll be successful in my sobriety for maybe a month. And build my life back up. Seemingly recovered. That's when I decide, ""I can have a couple, I'm ok now. I've got a job, I'm back on track. I'm not going to let myself decend back in to that situation again"". Yeah right. It happens again. And again. And so many times that nobody knows how many times I've done this whole routine. Drink to the point of collapse, pick myself up, regain momentum, the trust of others, become human again. Well the thing is with humans as we all know is they are predictable creatures that follow the same patterns. Why do you think people have routines? Why do you think we have tradition? Why is it that we have sayings like ""once a crook, always a crook""? I could go on, but you get my point.

So here I, this human, is again. Sat on a hospital ward. Taking medications designed to hinder the effects of serious alcohol misuse. With the same guilt as I felt last time. With the same determination to never be here again. With the same plan to get counciling. With the same lump in my throat. The same feelings of pain inside. Except this time. I've decided, I'm not going to try and fix myself. Patch up the beaten and rundown shell of a person. Instead, I'm going to kill that person. He once existed. But just like all things that existed, that's all they did, they exist in the past. Not the present or the future. 

When a person is born. They aren't manufactured in a factory with exact specifications. Like a product designed to a perform a certain task that has exact limitations on its capabilities. You can build a car and that car is that car and it has it's own strengths and it's own weaknesses. You can ad parts here and there and it with perform slightly better at certain things. But it's still the same car. No matter what. 

It takes a lot of designing an engineering to make anything good. It also takes a lot of reengineering and trial and error to create a truly magnificent specimen. Nobody in the history of the planet has ever hit the nail on the head the very first time. Ever heard of the Delorean? It takes time and conscientiousness for something to become truly great. Elon Musk blew up his first three rockets costing billions. In fact his first successful launch, had it not worked would have been his last, because he had no more cash left to perform another. So sometimes it's better to not aim for immediate perfection because in the end, it will ultimately fail. No matter how sure you think you are. 

Three weeks ago. I was sailing smoothly. I was about to get my driver's license back after an almost 8 year absence. I was working a high pressure IT contractor job that paid handsomely. My own place. And my proud and loving father, in preperation for the return of me regaining road legal status. Had bought me a car that he knew I would love. It wasnt anything fancy, but he knew I would love and cherish that car like a baby. He went out of his way to get ot certified for road use. He fixed it up where it needed work. Himself, with his own two hands. He fitted parts that didn't even need doing. He just wanted to give me something to be proud of. I was so happy and appreciated it so much. Everything was looking good and everything was on track. All we had to do is wait for my license in the mail. It got to Christmas. We had a lovely Christmas Day together. Things were looking so great in fact, when I got home I figured I'll have few beers. And then that's when it all went pear shaped. I finished the beers and I didn't really feel like I was happy enough, so I got a few more. The next thing I knew I was black out drunk. By this point is was the next day. Me in my drunken stupor decided ""FLIP IT! IM GONNA JUST GET FULL ON DRUNKED UP TODAY"" Which carried on to the next day. By this point I had been ignoring calls. So I figured people are gonna know somethings up. So I locked the door, turned the lights out and made the decision that if anyone comes knocking, I'll just make it seem like no one's home. Two weeks pass. By this point my body was completely dependent on alcohol to the point where I couldn't even get a jacket on with any sort of ease because of the withdrawal. My apartment had descend in to a disgusting mess. I was a mess. And all I could think about is how much of a disgrace I am. I had completely betrayed my dad. He didn't deserve the treatment I was giving him. He's done so much for me and would never ever do this to me or anyone else, so why was I doing this to him? Because I was ashamed? Because I was scared? I decided to open the door. He didn't even need to say his piece. His eyes said it all. 

He left. And I was alone. Fighting the worst withdrawals I had ever faced. A day or two go by. The symptoms begin to subside. I conger the strength to begin the clean up operation. I do bits here and there. But I'm weak. And it's hard. I'm shaking. I'm sweating. It comes and goes. But I cant sleep. My sides are hurting but I know it's just inflammation and will subside eventually. And then the visual flashes start. The phantom noises. I'm hallucinating all over the place. And so I try and sleep. But when i close my eyes something I've never known occurred. I was still seeing things. Things like from a dream. And its intense. From disgusting creatures about to attack me to me flying directly to the ground. So many things I can even begin to describe. So I'm laid awake alone, with the light on because in the dark the outside hallucinations are there. I'm in hell. This is full on Delirium Tremons or DT. Which is one of the most likely things to kill you without sedatives. I call an ambulance. In the hospital the bloods show I have pancreatitis. And that I'm most likely going to need immediate surgery. Then move me to the surgical decisions unit. Put me in a room on my own. So now all I can think about is how I've completely fucked my life. How have I become this? Was it worth it? I might die. And all I can think about is how my guilty my dads gonna feel at my funeral. Something he 100% does not deserve. He's the best dad anyone could have ever asked for. He would do anything for his kids. This isn't his fault. At all. On that bed all I wanted to tell him is how he's not to blame. How much i love him. And how much I admire him. But I can't. And the most horrible thing is, is that I'm his only son. The curtain opens and it's a specialist on pancreatitis. She asked me to explain everything. So I do. She says to me. ""Well from looking at your bloodwork, people with pancreatitis have certain markers. Usually we would expect to see a level of 600. Yours is 100. So it doesn't make sense why you've been referred to us. I'm going to go and speak with one of me other colleagues and see if there's anything I'm missing"" she leaves. I dont even care about the second opinion, I cant flippin believe it!! I a flippin miracle!! In my eyes I've been given a second chance. I'm crying like crazy. Even though he hates me right now I didn't care all i want to do is call my dad and tell him how sorry I am. But its 3.30am and I dont think he would appreciate that very much. 

I text my dad in the morning. Tell him I'm here. And not much else. 

I text him again and give him the rundown of my intentions. And now were talking again. And that to me is all I need.

Thanks for reading my story full of typos and grammatical errors. But I'm sat on the chair next to my hospital bed as we speak and the top half of my touch screen doesn't work so it's pretty hard to correct stuff.

Crazy thing is, I'm four days sober with out a single withdrawal besides a little cloudiness, mild hand shakes and hard time sleeping with odd dreams... and it's getting better every day... I actually slept through the night last night feeling decent when I woke up and my appetite is back.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible to not experience withdrawls until after the week mark? 

Thanks in advance",3

Hi friends.

I'd like to stop drinking, and I think I have what it takes to do so. My issue is that since I've been regularly drinking 4-6+ beers nightly, on days that I decide not to, I'm hit with panic and anxiety.

It only really happens at night, as that's when I would typically drink. Rarely if ever (maybe a weekend game or something) do I drink before the evening. My anxiety manifests itself via ""ooh I'm having a heart attack"" and I think I'm dying. I succumb and drink a few beers to make that go away, but it's always the urge to have that panic stop, more so than ""god I'd really like a beer right now"".

I need to learn how or what to replace alcohol in this equation. I think I'm mentally tough enough but a few reads on here have me concerned for my safety. I don't thiiiiiink I'd have serious withdrawals aside from extreme boredom, but is that possible with my usage?

If the responses (which I very much appreciate) are that I should see a doctor, can someone please outline what exactly that would entail? I just want to know that when the panic sets in, that I'm actually safe and can just hunker down and endure until it passes.

On that note, how long does that take to go away if anybody here has had similar experiences? I know there's a lot of questions in this post but I appreciate anybody taking the time to help me out. 25 y/o male if that is relevant.

Thanks :)",11

I'm young man in mid 20s, and I have thought that my drinking isn't a problem since ""I don't drink that much"". But I have noticed that it affects me still and I drink too much. My drinking NEVER is responsible.

It has been hard for me to not drink beer or two at least every third day. But recently, every time I drink even one beer, I can't keep it at that one. Nowadays I see my friend only when we grab a few cold ones, but usually never that's not few for me. And that's when the problems start.

When I'm sober, I'm very calm and rational. Under the influence of alcohol, I fuck up everything. Right now I'm pretty much at the bottom (bottom at least for me). I'm at the point that I'm thinking about leaving my company, move to another city and leave my family and the friends I have here.

I have ruined so many people's lives when I have been drunk. Caused breakups for my acquaintances by sleeping with their women, broken other friends hearts and my girlfriend's hearts, messed up my working and all other things I think you guys know. 

Every time when I have f**** up, I have been totally devastated and feeling hate towards my self. Because I'm asshole. I always have been sorry for my doings towards other people and have apologized, even when I know that it doesn't make up anything. But when I drink, I don't feel no guilt at anything. I have always thought that I could change and drink in ""more responsible way"", but seriously, I just can't. When that bottle opens up, so will wake up the person I hate the most in my life. I can't live anymore hurting others around me, and they never deserved what I have done or said.

So, this was my little opening for my self to see the depth of my problem. I hope from this day, I can improve myself somehow and that I can show myselft that I do not need to drink.",4

i don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. it's been years since i felt connected to the person staring back at me. i need to make a change but when i think about sobriety i commit myself to failure every time. 

i am posting now because i called out of work yesterday and went on an all day drinking and gambling binge. i got wasted and lost hundreds. in some ways i had a fantastic time but deep down i know i am trying to destroy myself. this was self sabotage that i tricked myself into calling a mental health day. when i got home i passed out on the couch. i woke up with the TV on and stumbled into bed. it is now about 6AM. i am feeling mostly sober and i haven't been able to fall back asleep. my mind is filled with the desire to be sober. the desire to have control over my life again. the desire to be proud of who i am. the desire to choose life instead of death. i need to be sober. i want to recommit myself to this goal but i don't know how to find the strength. i have failed every time before and i cannot see how this time will be different. 

to those who are now sober, how did you make that change in your life?

to those of you who bartend sober, how do you resist temptation? ...especially at first.

this is not the life i want anymore. i cannot spend my days dying anymore. how do i break this addiction to self destruction?

I've gotten pretty wrecked many, many, many times over that stretch. For a good amount of time, I'd get drunk but generally remembered how things went the night before, even if it was spotty. A few years ago, I experienced my first blackout state. I remember texting a friend and then waking up hours later in my room with no recollection of what happened after that text. 

It was a one time thing, though, and I didn't really blackout again for a couple more years. The next time was in 2015.

After that, again, it proved another one off deal and stayed this way for a few more years. But now, this past year, it's becoming more and more frequent. This past Friday, I got drunk with some friends, and got into a fight. I don't really remember anything about it. The last memory I have is walking outside but apparently, we drank well after that. I took a Lyft home and don't remember that at all. In fact, the last few weeks, I've blacked out three of the four times I drank somewhat heavily. A few weeks ago, I even smacked my head out in a playground we were playing around in drunk and I don't recall any of it, nor taking my Lyft home. 

I don't think I'm drinking any more than I was a year ago but it's just becoming way more common to get blackout drunk. Is there a reason for this? Is my tolerance just not as high as it used to be? I'm scared I'm doing irreversible damage. It's just so odd that I never had this problem but now I'm having it almost every time I drink.",4

Please help me.,"I’m the oldest sibling (23f) of four kids. The second oldest is 18, followed by a 14 year old, and an 11 year old. My parents have been alcoholics for as long as I can remember but it’s gotten progressively worse in the last 6 years. Growing up my father was the worst of the two but as of the last 5 years my mother has become out of control. She starts with spiked seltzer’s and things like that in the morning and moves to straight up vodka around 1. She’s incredibly mean when she’s drunk. She drives the youngest kids around like this. She cusses out my 14 year old sister daily. In the last two years I’ve learned she is sometimes physically abusive to my sister. She was with me too but I think I tried to make myself believe she wouldn’t do it to my sister (don’t ask why.. it doesn’t make sense, I know). The first couple times I tried to bring it up to her directly, she’d lie, and it ended up worse for my sister and for me. My sister is completely isolated and removed from the household. My youngest brother (11) is effected in his own way but is clearly favored and has never been physically abused as far as me or any other siblings know. Me and my 18 year old brother are both out of the house and on our own (I have been since I was kicked out at 15). He rarely sees our parents or our siblings. I recently moved across country. Before I left my sister begged me not to “abandon her” (her words- I was heartbroken for her). My husbands work was the reason for the move. I had to go but upon visiting home I’m feeling immense guilt. My mom doesn’t work and my dad cannot miss work for treatment. Even if I could cover their household expenses and take care of the two youngest for a bit, I have no way of paying for one or both of them to get treatment and I don’t think they’d go willingly. I’ve considered calling cps but the system is broken and I imagine that’d be worse for them. I have my own two children and would take them in in an instant if I could but simply can’t afford four children. I feel like I’ve abandoned my sister and brother. I don’t know what to do. She’s depressed and isolated. Depression runs in our family- I tried to commit suicide at 14 because of my parents drinking. I struggled with anorexia and bulimia, self harming, and drug abuse all through middle and high school. I got myself together and eventually started a family but had to go through lots (and mostly on my own) to get here. My brother is mostly happy but sometimes incredibly volatile. I’m worried about them both, but my sister especially. I was lucky to survive my many issues in high school and can’t think of her going through even worse shit than I did. As the oldest sibling, I have to do something but feel like I have no options. I can’t stand to think of my sister in that house anymore. If anyone else has experienced this, what have you done?

My father passed nearly 2 years ago and since then my mother has been diving further into alcoholism. She always drank but never this much. We offered help but lied about taking it and eventually she took help when she started dating a new man. This was all relatively recently in December and we had a different Christmas but a sober one. My mother took help from a local rehab centre and we figured we were in the clear. She was clear and so thankful. I had no idea it was that bad but the withdrawal was definitely real and I did not know about the seizures or shaking.

Fast forward to my son's first birthday this weekend. My mom asks me for a glass of wine as if it were nothing. I questioned if she should be drinking and she assured me she can have a little. I refused. From speaking to friends and family I found out she had been drinking again and I've been lied to repeatedly. I know she secretly had the goal of becoming a ""casual drinker"" again. I've never really seen her as an addict until then. 

My wife will be returning to work in a few weeks and my mom was supposed to watch my son a few days of the week. I now know I cannot trust her not to drink or safely take care of my son and I need to say this to her. She was having shakes and drinking 24/7 to stop them. I feel ashamed even writing that she was supposed to watch my son. 

How do I have this conversation? I feel like this is going to cause a large fight within our family but know it needs to happen for my sons safety. Words can barely describe my disappointment. Is it better to talk to a professional? Hire an interventionist? Or just explain my feelings myself? 

Thanks for reading. Always felt very supported by the community.",2

My Aunt is an alcoholic and has been for 24 years. She is like a mother to me. Some very basic background is my family is VERY involved in one another's lives and I don't think their methods of support have been ideal, but as someone who has never faced addiction or rehab, I would like to know the thought's of those who have been through it and can see this situation more clearly. After 24 years, my aunt transitioned from a functioning alcoholic to a non-functioning alcoholic. She was content with her drinking problem until this happened, and was very self-aware about it. She called me and told me she intended to stop drinking, and on the first of the year (Jan 1st, 2020) would start attending AA daily. This was her own decision, as my family stopped trying to convince her to do anything a very long time ago. They even drank with her on holidays and at dinners. She attempted to quit New Year's Eve and decided to not go out. 

She was immediately sick, had horrible cravings, and called my (actual) mother. My aunt said she didn't think she could get through detox alone and that she felt horrible and wanted to go to rehab. They couldn't get her in anywhere that night but found one for the following day (new year day.) She called me and told me she wanted to go in for the Detox process, which she thought might last around 5-7 days. She did. On the 7th day, my mom and another aunt (lets call her P) visited her and she wanted to leave. P and my mom made the decision to rush out and leave her there without telling her they were leaving. Since then, my entire family has been trying to make decisions for my aunt. My grandfather, whom they are all very incredibly close with and see weekly, decided she should stay 28-90 days and should have no contact with her, and P agreed. 

They think isolating her and not seeing her will make it easier for her to want to stay in rehab. Meanwhile, I told my mom I disagreed and that my aunt would need support. Today, my mom visited again and my aunt has been there for two weeks exactly. My aunt had her bags packed and expressed to my mom that she wanted to go home, and that she never signed up to stay for 28 days, that she just wanted to come in on her own accord to detox. She explains that she wants to stay with my mom, go to AA meetings daily, and get on a new routine. My mom called me in a panic and asked what she should do when my aunt asked her to take her home (to my mom's house,) she's now concerned that visiting her did make her want to leave. I told my mom to talk to her, and try to see if my aunt thought staying in rehab would be in her best interest, and if my aunt didn't agree, then I thought it would be better to take her home. 

The reason I think this is because my aunt can check herself out on her own at any time, and has not. She can call a cab and do whatever she likes. What I don't want is for her to feel alone, and abandoned, and do something like leave and go to a bar, or even just feel she has nowhere to go at all. My mom went in and spoke to her, and my mom needed to rush to a job interview directly after and told my aunt she wouldn't have time to take her home today anyway and to stay for one more night. So my question now is what does anyone on this forum think about this situation? My mom is dependant on me for answers on this, and the rest of my family seems forceful about just this one option of rehab. If she left early she would not have support from them, and I do think they would make her feel worse, which would ruin the transparency my aunt has been trying to have with them. 

My aunt expects to hear from my mom tomorrow, and I truly don't know what to do. At this point, I think my mom should pick her up tomorrow morning and help her find local meetings, take her to them daily, and have my aunt get a counselor outside of rehab that can help her with short-term and long-term goals. I think my mom should establish a level of openness with my aunt so that if my aunt ever does feel overwhelmed by her triggers, she can tell my mom that she may need actual time in rehab outside of detoxing. I just don't think attempting to force her to stay there will result in her truly learning anything. But I could be wrong. PS my family lives on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast. That's why this has been something my mom has had to do on her own. If I was there I would absolutely be the one handling all of this. My aunt and I's connection is incredibly deep, and I'm the one she calls when she needs to vent, get advice, etc. If anyone has any advice at all on my current thoughts, please let me know. Thank you!",0

I used to only drink on the weekends and have a couple of beers. This has slowly inched its way into the work week. I’ve also noticed my anxiety has been substantially worse the last few months which in this fucked up way ends up increasing my drinking. Over the course of December with the holidays and a recent family trip I drank for almost a month straight with only a few days off. I haven’t drank in two days and am just feeling super fucking lethargic, down, depressed. I know that this is a hard come down-but also am I awaking to the reality that I’m an alcoholic?

The last time I drank I blacked out and woke up not knowing how I got home. Spent about 80.00 on alcohol and drugs. I knew that if I was going to live and not have this happen again I was going to have to stop drinking. The first week was pretty terrible. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and cry and go to the corner store and buy a bottle of wine. But I didn’t because I knew I wanted to keep this promise to myself that I was worth it. There have been a lot of challenges in this past 30 days, especially feeling all the feelings of a recent break up and people not asking me to hang out or do anything. But I found myself getting back into cemetery photography and back into my running, which I really enjoy. Tomorrow I start at six figure job as a software developer for a local bank.

I never ever, in my life, found it so important until about 9 months ago. It made a big impact on my life.  
Some know & some don't, that I am an alcoholic.  I have known that I have loved booze for a really long time.  
The term alcoholism or alcoholic was to me, a different world, something I was not. I have always payed my bills and that made everything ok. But I was fucken wrong.  Alcohol is destructive.  Alcohol is a fun little enemy.   It can be your friend, it can help you have fun in bad times and it can help you believe you are a people person. Believe me I used alcohol to get everything I could out of it!  Alcohol also changes who you are as a person.   It rearranges how you think and slowly I lost who I was and I hope to never be that person again! 
Now let’s think about that. In the beginning stages of the alcoholic mode, I lost Zachary Livingston the kid & person I was before drinking and then slowly became a drunk ""Zack.""  It didn't happen over night, it was slowly & progressively changing me and I had little to no idea it was happening except I knew in the back of my mind and it was like I was liking the crazy and I wanted to push it and see how crazy it could get and still be ok and I did!  I pushed hard for years and years and my life became unmanagable, probably like some crazy movie with stupid twists, lows,  ups & downs.  In the process I was slowly loosing my abilities to feel and express true emotions and by the end, it was a world of FEAR that I lived in!   FEAR all the time!  Fear of loosing everything, fear of withdrawals, fear of feelings, fear of driving, fear of being in public, fear of going anywhere, fear of dying, and the small amounts of sober I had, hurt so bad.  I definitely felt depressed and confused.  I knew booze was bad, I knew I needed to stop, but there was no fucken way I was gonna do it.  All the ""Horrible stuff"" stopped completely within the first half of the first drink! I found it crazy.  I believed ""I"" was crazy!  I had come to terms that booze was going to kill me and there was nothing I could do to stop it!  I became comfortable with that and lived like that for a long time. By this time I had children and just to think about them and how I was teaching them to be people, when I knew in my mind, booze was going to take me out because I was unable to be sober & feel!  It was completely crazy!  I tried and tried to be sober and failed and failed and tried and failed again but kept trying! I look at it like the world had the tools for me to use to find sobriety, I just needed to not only find the tools but use them in the right order like a kind of puzzle to freedom! 
Then by some miracle it happened!!!  I was trying to stop drinking so I put an interlock in my car so at least I would not drive drunk. But fuck that!  Drunk Zack was smart too.  He got that bitch to start and he was off, on his way home to sleep the drunk away!  He didn't make it.   The police woke him up.  He was sleeping in his car at a red light!  Yep I was busted with a 40oz in my lap half empty and many empty ones through out the car.  I was out of jail the next morning and I lost myself!!! 100% full fledge self destruction!  3 days later I was served divorce papers.  2 weeks after that, I was staying with someone that drank more then I did. 
 I was charged with a DUI & I was assigned a caseworker and was put on U/As.  I hadn’t been in trouble, for over 10 years I think, and at that time they could only test for alcohol within 24 hrs!  Science had discovered a way to test for 5 fucken days now and..... Bam! Bam! Bam!!   Dirty!  Dirty! and Dirty!!  My caseworker told me to try to medically detox.  I tried but that was a joke.  Lol!   I was drunk the next day after detox.  My caseworker suggested that I try to get a red card.  I was shocked!  I didn’t really smoke pot because it super fucked me up when I was drinking.  Dirty after dirty U/As kept happening.  One day I went to court and didn’t have too  many dirty U/As but was told, people were concerned for the safety of the public, as during this time I was found sleeping drunk in my car by the police and told to get a cab out of there.  When I went to court, I was sent to jail that day!   Get this, they have an under ground tunnel to the jail from the courthouse!   It was crazy.  They released me the next morning.  I drove straight to the booze shop and got two 40s and immediately drank them to stop the shivers and sweating and not 5 minutes later my caseworker called and said I had till 5pm to go to this place where they were going to strap this thing to my ankle and it would sniff me every 20 minutes to see if I drank! Wow!   Science is crazy!  I went to get my red card that same day as maybe a back up plan.  I really didn’t know if I was going to even try to stop drinking.  I got to the place 10 minutes before they closed and strapped up my leg. That evening I went home to a super drunk friend.  It was one week till Christmas and I knew in my heart that I needed to be around for Christmas & not in jail or missing or something. My kids needed me to be around for Christmas! 
That was ONE YEAR AGO! 
 I don’t know if you know but the first day without alcohol isnt that bad but by day 3,  Holy Fuck!!!  I tried to cover it with a lot of THC edibles.  It helped a lot, but rendered me very useless.  I was still staying with that drunk person.  On day one, we were on the same level and every day that went by I felt different and they stayed the same, stuck where I was,  just a few days before. By the time Christmas hit I was a full fledged wreck.  Thats when I found out, I forgot how to feel feelings.  It was like getting hit by a train right after being beaten with a shovel! Shaking, sweating, cold, confused full of anxiety and super scared!  But a real scared!  A different fear from the fear I had when I was drinking! I realized that this scared feeling I felt was REAL & was not caused by alcohol. I sat there that night and thought, maybe I could make it till New Years, not drinking and then I will drink and go back to my path of destruction. A few days later, the person I was staying with moved thousands of miles away and was still stuck right where I was on December 19th . I’m glad I saw them every day during my first part of detoxification to look at and see what I was and see the sickness of alcoholism in its pure raw form as my mind started to clear itself of alcohol.  New Years came and I spent alot of  time with my children, started to figure out where I was going to live & kept working.  I smoked some pot to calm panic attacks. (I started getting panic attacks a few years ago every time I tryed to stop drinking.)  I made a commitment to get an apartment with a old friend and worked out my budget. Well look at that!   Sober me was making plans and goals now!!! And you know what?  They started to work out!  My divorce was finalized,  plans were made that worked out for everyone! 
I started to identify new feelings on a daily basis. I remember looking at a calendar and was so surprised I hadn't drank for 90 days!  Wow!  I looked on Facebook, of all places.  I looked at it and was... ok this is the moment!  This is it!  I’m going to be sober!  I’m really going to work for this and I knew I could do this!  
From that day forward, I have built a super strong support system.   I only keep the best people in my life! I also set lots of goals.  I have hour long goals,  day long goals,  week long goals, year long goals and even decade goals and I’m making them happen too!   Crazy right?  
I lost my drivers license and had to go to jail for 30 days.  6 months of not drinking only to get to go to jail & then work release!  I had to put a breathelizer in my car & got my drivers license back.   I started alcohol treatment/therapy & I make sure I get my moneys worth, every time I go.  I make them follow their plans.  I lost my shit on them when they didn’t let me finish an activity and demanded a refund and now they make sure I get my time and make use of all the material they provide.  They don't skip anything.  Not with me!  Fuckers, I pay for treatment,  you provide it! 
That brings us to today.   December 19th 2019 my one year sobriety date!!  
Looking back on this last year, I feel I have grown more than any of my 20 years as an adult. I feel FREE!  I have newly found feelings & understanding  for people that suffer from addiction and their potential to feel what I feel & felt.  I have hope they look for the tools that work for them because I could never buy this feeling or be given it!   I’m so happy I found it & I’m so excited to see what 2020 has to offer me & other addicts that also want to be free.

To give some context I'm 24F and have always known my father to be an aggressive alcoholic.  I was lucky to enough to have a mum that took me out of that situation when I was six and they got a divorce. I sadly at that age did witness them fighting regularly with one night resulting in my mum getting beaten up so badly that her face became unrecognisible and bizarrely my six year old mind used to blame myself for what was happening. Not long after the divorce my father got remarried and as my mum still wanted me to have a father figure in my life, I would occasionally visit them. My father's aggression would fluctuate depending on the day but his alcohol intake was always consistent. During those years I have witnessed a lot of things that I have only this summer been able to leave in the past with therapy.   
However this post isn't about my father, it's about my mum.   
She has always liked the occasional beer after work but it has now turned into 4-5 a night with the occasional sober day in between so nowhere near as much as my father (I don't know what else to compare it to) but definitely more than 'normal'?   
I've tried talking to her, she hasn't taken me seriously but eventually accepted that maybe she does drink too much and it's mainly because of boredom. She doesn't become aggressive, she becomes happier. So it's really difficult to distinguish if this is an actual problem.   
We spoke about the quantity of her drinking and she agreed that she needed to cut down but didn't and has continued to drink since these conversations. This is when I got very angry and said a lot of things which I shouldn't have said, calling her irresponsible and comparing her to my dad and a plethora of other things to which she replied I was making it all about myself.   


I realised I don't have the knowhow of dealing with yet again another parent with alcohol issues, I have no tolerance towards it which is very unfair on my mum. I'm not taking it very well at all, I've been in bed for the past three days only to have her come into my room this evening to tell me she was going to the shop and for me not to get mad at her for buying more beers. Even typing this out is making me realise just how problematic this is and I just can't believe I never saw this happening right under my own eyes.   


I have a thousand things going through my mind. What's going to happen to her health? Is it going to get worse when I leave home? Should I leave home? How do I help her? Have I made it worse? Am I the reason?   


Anyway, this is all a bit of a shitshow isn't it? Any advice would be appreciated and apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.   
I'd also liked to add that if you are someone dealing with alcohol issues, carry on fighting through them because it's absolutely worth getting your sobriety back.   
I don't understand why such a toxic substance is legal. Take my story as an example of many which could have panned out very differently had alcohol not been a part of it. 

  
tl;dr: Father's always been an alcoholic and now I may have an alcoholic mother too.",2

I just dont know why i cant continue acting as normal or even half pick up on when im drinking too much. I pick out any minor problem and act like its a big deal despite her giving me the world.

I’ve been on reddit now browsing the threads on alcoholism for months now but I’ve never posted. But it’s gotten to the point where I need to reach out and gather opinions on my own personal situation. 

Writing this with shaky hands, recovering from a 4 day bender, I’m just sick of “bouncing back” from these benders. I’ll have a GREAT 4 months and then out of nowhere go walk down the street and buy a handle of fireball and finish it in 3 days. I’ve had 5 seizures, experienced DT’s an unhealthy amount of times, and hear and see things that aren’t really after every bender. The WORST is hearing sounds/music that isn’t even there. And it’s vivid, as if I can hear the chords and vocals of a song that I’ve never even heard before and it just plays through my head. That, and then the sudden jolts of explosions I hear in my ears/head that stir me awake as I’m trying to fall asleep.

This is somewhat of a venting session so forgive me if it gets annoying, but I’d just like to hear what some of you have done to SUSTAIN sobriety and not just stick to these month long strains of it. I attend AA, have a decent sponsor, have family support, and seek help from multiple counselors on a weekly basis, but nothing seems to stick right.

I’m not even sure if this is the right area to be posting such information or if I should go over to a different area (still new to Reddit). But feel free to lay it on me if you’d like because the youtube videos and advice from friends who have no idea what I’m going through, can only go so far.

Thanks ladies and gents",2

I’ve done pretty well with moderation mentally (or so I thought) , physically I’ve struggling with the kindling effect and feeling WDs after a night of heavier than usual drinking. 

I guess it still has some mental hold because I’ve realized I can’t enjoy shows as much sober. I know I used to be able to, I went to concerts long before I started drinking. And I always had a good time. 


I went to a sober venue last night for the first time, and I just didn’t have much fun. I drank a bit before hand, but was sober by time the show started. The music was good, but I just couldn’t jam like I usually do. I felt anxious and awkward without a drink in my hand, and resorted to chain smoking, which, I don’t even like smoking sober. I just needed something. I couldn’t hardly focus on the bands because my mind was either on how awkward I felt, how much I wanted a drink, OCD related obsessions, or how I felt guilty for being at a show instead of working (I’m an graphic designer and a workaholic and since I freelance i struggle to give myself time off”  


I feel guilty for not being able to enjoy the show sober, and I’m upset that I couldn’t enjoy it. I didn’t hate it or anything, I don’t regret going, but it’s the first time I was just having an “ok time”.  lm also upset that alcohol still clearly has a mental hold on me, I hate this. I don’t want to quit though, which I know is dumb rationally.  But I don’t go to shows super often at least...",1

2020-01-11 07:24:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/en6ty6/am_i_an_alcoholic/,Am I an alcoholic?,"I am a 25 year old male. I honestly never thought I was an alcoholic or anything as I can go extended periods of time without drinking. I may occasionally have a beer when chilling alone but don’t feel the urge to have more after. I can even go periods of weeks without a drink. My issue is whenever I hang out with friends and have a drink I can’t stop. I plan on having one or two and end up having 15 drinks. Every time I drink socially I end up hammered. I keep my composure very well, and never seem shitfaced. Most people say I didn’t seem that drunk the next day even after 15 drinks in, knowing I was pretty fucked up. I can and have gone up to 3-4 weeks without one drink. But once I have one drink socially I get absolutely fucked, then start doing it more often. I was off work for holidays for 2.5 weeks, and would say I drank around 14 of the 18 days as I was hanging with a lot of friends, and every time was with friends I got absolutely shitfaced (probs had 150-200 drinks over those couple weeks). I came back home from the holidays and said I’m done binge drinking for a month as my body felt like it was shutting down. After getting home (different town then where I was for holidays), my buddy I hadn’t seen in a while invited me out tonight and I thought why not. I told him I’d have a couple drinks max as I need to work tomoro to catch up on stuff. I ended up drinking 15+ drinks, ended up at the casino to keep the night going, and am now at home awake past 6am. It’s almost like I lose control after the first couple drinks and can’t stop, and it only happens when with other people. I can control it when alone but when with others I can’t stop. When out with others, I always tell myself I will only have a couple drinks then have at least 10. It is especially an issue at work events as I work in finance and people drink often. Whenever we go out for a social event I try to limit myself to a few drinks as don’t want to do anything embarrassing around work colleagues and so I can get up for work the next day on time, and end up having like 10-15 drinks every time, and then am often late for work the next day, feeling shitty. Is this alcoholism? How can I stop this? Most my friends drink and when we hang out I almost always drink excessively.

It is possible it is a coping thing I do to help me when going out socially to feel more comfortable. Starting in 8th grade I used to chug a couple shots of my parents alcohol to ease my nerves before a date, and this shit may have stuck. My last ex I only really hung out with her while we were getting drunk together, and didn’t stop drinking every single time we hung out until like 4-5 months in when I was more comfortable with her. Is this considered alcoholism or something different? How can I change this?",2

It's also that everybody talks about the liver all the time but not really about your brain.
So after a lot of consumed alcohol, do your braincells really die and you can't get back your lost intelligence? Or are it just your synapses that get damaged and they can grow back if you use your brain often and think a lot?

The night after she became unconscious is when I opened her wardrobe to find empty bottles of wine. Overall in her room there were 60 bottles !! We were together for over 12 years, married for over 5 years, and never did I truly think she was an alcoholic. Despite her depression for the past 1.5 years, despite seeing her passed out and slurring on multiple occasions, despite even other people asking her if she was drunk. I was under the impression that these were symptoms of her anxiety/ depression. She was fine 90% of the time - a real pleasure to be with. And I believed and trusted her immensely. In the run up to her hospitalization, she even had nausea and stomach aches which we attributed to her anti depressant. Even when the doctors asked about alcohol, she did not accept it - may be because I was in the room? 

I feel so fucking guilty right now (and incredibly stupid) that I did not figure this out while she was alive. There was so much I could have done to save her. I love her deeply - she really was my everything. 

How is it that I wasn’t able to figure it out ?? Why did she have to hide it so badly from me - we used to go out drinking once a week at least. Why wouldn’t she accept it to the doc (!) when they’ve already told her it’s serious ?",14

I'm 63 years old and retired.  Up until the past year or so my pattern would be do whatever I had to do at home or with my job and then at 5:00 take a highball glass, filled to the brim with ice and add vodka.  I might head in the garage or yard and smoke a cigar.  This would be off and on over the years, and I'd drink until about 7 (maybe 4 or 5 in total).  There would be breaks in this habit, sometimes a month or more.

Last January my wife took a job in Germany (we live in the states) and was gone most of the year with the odd visit home.  By the time 5:00 rolled around I was bored out of my mind and for the past year, virtually without pause, would pour that first drink at 5 and continue with that habit.  Again, 4-6 ""drinks"" a night.  Most nights I went to bed not drunk but damn close.

I decided this needs to stop so a couple nights ago I dumped everything out and am determined to get my health back.  Last night (and this has happened in the past when I ""quit"" I had 3 or 4 terror dreams and I don't know if I was screaming or talking out loud but pretty sure I was.

Tonight, I am getting on a plane to fly 11 hours to the UK in business class and I'm freaking out that I'm going to have some hallucinatory dream and freak everyone else out.

He's not a big drinker, but will have a glass of wine with me if I open it (which I basically do every weekend because I've ~earned it~), he rarely will suggest opening a bottle. He usually won't have a second glass but I always do and if I'm up to it will finish the bottle. 

Every so often (sometimes less than monthly, sometimes once a month, sometimes a few times a month, depends on my social life at a given time) I will drink too much and sometimes black out and be extremely hungover the next day where I can't function. I tend to use parties or special occasions to excuse this (weddings, holidays, birthdays, etc). 

Anyway, like probably thousands of Americans I've opted to do a dry January and I think it's definitely harder than it should be for an average person, especially considering it's only been 10 days. Last night I had to attend a work event and ordered a club soda with lime but really wanted to order a drink. I felt the need to justify my non-drinking based on the looks , which is honestly bizarre, but that's the culture and I honestly feel bad for people who really are trying to quit completely. 

All night I just really wanted to order a drink and had the urge to get one and basically had to force myself to intentionally not order one all night. I never got one but I couldn't stop thinking about it. Anyway though this made me realize maybe my relationship with alcohol is unhealthy and I should work on it?",2

It smelled. A lot. Like enough to give someone a migraine if they passed the bathroom. The smell followed me into my room and you absolutely didn't need to be Sherlock to figure out who it was. 
And today I am drinking hand sanitizer.

I don't want to. I really don't. I love being sober most of the time. It's like I can fight the urge most of the time, but then it hits me when I'm too tired or emotionally fragile to fight it and I give in. I am twenty years old. People say that I am bright. I am loved. I have a lot to live for.

2020-01-10 06:35:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/emps80/the_day_after_the_hangover/,The Day After the Hangover,"55-year old male.  Been drinking since I was 21.  Generally, I drink one day a week (either Friday or Saturday).  I work hard and work out in the mornings during the week, so there's no desire or even temptation to drink during the week.

&#x200B;

When I go out on Saturdays, I'll go pretty hard.  Have 7 or 8 vodka-on-the-rocks.  When I get a healthy buzz, I'll go home.  Don't want to be TOO drunk in public.  But no doubt I have a very nice buzz.  Friends have always told me I'm a happy drunk.  The next day (hangover day) isn't TOO bad.  I have the usual headache (that Tylenol can cure), lethargy, and fatigue.  But as a rule, nothing debilitating. I can function, I don't throw up.  If I'm alone with no external stimuli, I will sit on the couch, eat, and watch TV all day.  If I have something to do, I can generally do it.  Granted, there have been some days where the  hangover is really bad, but those are few and far between.

&#x200B;

My issue is that over the past year, I'm completely exhausted and fatigued the day AFTER the hangover.  It's not a hangover anymore (at least in the conventional sense).  No headache, no dizzy feeling.  It's just utter fatigue.  I want to sleep all day, have no energy to do ANYTHING.  The fatigue is only upstairs in my head, I'm SLEEEEEPY.  Body feels fine. I figured it would go away, but it hasn't, and now I'm tired of being tired on Day Two.

&#x200B;

Anyone else experience these symptoms on the day after the hangover?",2

All the hospital does is stabilises me and sends me on my way. Its financially impossible to afford alcohol to stop these bad withdrawals, which the Drs say I need to continue drinking.

 The other day I slashed my wrists and went to a bridge over a dual carigeway hoping to jump off as I'm so sick of this cycle. A family member got me before I did.

I want to stop but the hallucinations, jumpiness being so confused and the seizures are too much. I have woke up on the floor drool all over my mouth and have banged my head twice now. I can't keep food or water down. I have no money. 

I don't know what to do. Im in debt. I'm behind on bills. Is the bridge my only option. I want a inpatient detox but can't get one. I really want this to end. These withdrawals are too painful. 

My partner is fed up, and she doesnt understand these withdrawals, she keeps saying I'll be fine. I'm at my wits end and can't cope. The alcohol services are literally useless I've tried to get help.

Well last night she got extra emotional, while drunk. So she literally sat her bottle in the passenger seat and drove 10 miles to my sister's house .

She parked in the middle of the street and sobbed in her car saying ""I don't have a home, I'm not loved, I'm worthless"" then saying ""idk what to do I can't park the car!!"" 

She literally did what she did when we were a child, but instead of knocking on our bedroom doors, she's showing up at our homes in the middle of the night. Endangering her life! And others!!

All around terrible. It may not sound like a big deal.

But to me drunk driving is NEVER OKAY and I'm so ashamed and upset and angry that the woman who raised me is drunk driving!!!

What did happen was I told my boss that I wouldn't be around for a while due to my attempt to 'fix' myself. Luckily, all i got was ""Good for you. We'll be here when you're ready.""

Well... fast forward a couple of weeks. The days between Dec 8th and the 19th were REALLY bad for me. I got several pieces of bad news. And in that eleven day span my already problematic drinking and depression decided to team up on me.

Thursday the 19th (no idea what time, but late), I made some rambling and disturbing texts to a friend. Disturbing enough that she was afraid I was going to hurt myself, or worse. As she was two hours away at the time, she called the police for a wellness check. I found myself in the ER shortly after. For several days I was really angry with my friend, but I came to understand that she probably saved my life.

All in all I ended up spending 5 days in the hospital for medical detox AND suicide watch. They discharged me Christmas Eve. Really amazing friends of mine came and made sure I got home safely.

ANYways... The point of this story. Tomorrow, I will be 3 weeks sober. I'm not gonna say it was or will be easy. Its damned hard. My daughter holding me, crying, saying ""I can't loose you."" made me finally realize how close I had come to destroying not only my own life, but the ones I care about the most.

Doesn’t drink on the job (according to him, of course, but I think he’s being truthful), but he tends to go overboard when he’s off the clock. A series of events in his personal life leads him to recognize his relationship with alcohol isn’t healthy, so he seeks help. The therapist he goes to warns him that therapists are legally required to report substance abuse because of his profession, so he decides to deal with it on his own.

Question:
Is there any way for pilots to seek professional help without losing their job, or is he pretty much stuck with off-the-books, AA-type organizations for support? Disclaimer: I recognize the dangers of an impaired pilot, and my intention is not to enable him. But this is also a good friend of mine, and I want to try and help him find a way to keep his job and get healthy. I appreciate any insight you all might have.

Some of the worst fights we've ever had, is when alcohol is involved. Now, I'm not a saint, but I drink WAY less than him and sometimes go weeks to months without a drop. When we argue and drinking is involved, I'm buzzed at best, he's usually fully lit.

3 times in the past 6 weeks he has left my apartment (we dont live together) in the middle of the night, drunk, and then \*not\* been the first to reach out after...and in one form or another blamed me for him leaving. The first time, he said ""you're kicking me out when I'm vulnerable!"" which was not true, I was sober, and had repeatedly asked him to stay. The second time, he wanted me to stop him from leaving (he told me this later) and when i didn't, he broke up with me and left. The third time was Saturday, and when we spoke days after the event (just last night) he heard me out and realized he had blacked out a lot of the night. When he left, he said ""I can't be in the room with you"" but he also said to me, sober, days later, ""I didn't want to leave, I wanted you to stop me"".

Before you suggest it, we are already going to a therapist tomorrow. It's someone we met with a few weeks ago whose been out of town. At this point, I am going to tell the therapist (it's a couples session) about these concerns I have. My boyfriend only drinks one night a week, but he absolutely binge drinks. He seems to think since it's one night, it's not an issue and professes he ""clearly has discipline"". I have disagreed for years. I say one night a week is enough to be a problem, depending how much you drink, and how it affects you.

My ex husband was a recovering alcoholic, so this is not new terrirtory for me and I am familiar that you cannot force someone to see they have a problem or need help. However, as we are both going to therapy tomorrow, I'm wondering if anyone could lend some advice as to the best way to phrase my concern.

I have already told my partner I do not want to be around him when he drinks for a few weeks, maybe a few months, depending how therapy goes. Can anyone help? What's your take?

TLDR; my partner only drinks once a week, but we often argue or he blacks out or storms out when he does. He doesn't think he has a problem. I think he does. We are going to therapy tomorrow, how do I best approach this?",1

I started drinking heavily when I was 15 and has been an ongoing cycle since. I’ve had many mental breakdowns with alcohol, suicidal attempts, lash outs and fights.  I use to go to work either hungover or still drunk in 2018, I’ve been reckless and my actions make me regretful and feel shameful at times. 

For a while now, I've been contemplating being sober. I want to be sober. Especially after many incidents like abuse and rape which ultimately I don't remember. Being raped twice in one night and not being able to remember a single thing besides a now well-formed scar on my leg. As well as getting myself in situations I often will not remember the next day. Alcoholism runs in my family on both sides, unfortunately. It's gotten to the point where my body doesn't process liquor the same and I often blackout. I've recently been struggling with alcohol especially being around many of those who drink. I know just remove myself but currently, I can't remove myself from this environment. I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore and I know the first step is acceptance. I have indeed accepted the fact that alcohol is taking control of my life and it's terrifying. (I’d also like to add smoking cigarettes was picked up due to drinking heavily and that’s also a problem I’ve been struggling with as well.)",1

Do I have a problem?,"I like beer.  No, I *love* beer.  I also enjoy the occasional glass of red wine or scotch on the rocks.  But I rarely get drunk because I hate it.  I'll get tipsy from time to time, but that's about as far as I like to take it.

When I get home from work, the first thing I do is crack a beer.   I might have one or two more later throughout the evening.  I used to be worse, drinking until I had a buzz, but I've since cut way back.  On the weekends, I'll have 5-10 drinks, but I make sure to not cross that threshold of getting drunk.

On Saturdays, or vacation, I like to have a beer or two in the middle of the day but, again, I don't get drunk.

I find beer relaxes me.  Helps me destress from work and traffic, helps me to loosen up a little, plus I like trying all sorts of different beers (though, I usually drink cheap beer).

I'm in my mind twenties and over the past 3 years there has probably been only 15 of so days where I *haven't* had a drink.

I guess what I am trying to ask is: do I have a problem?",3

Small backstory: I found myself starting to drink harder and much more often once my ex-girlfriend cheated on me in July. I was piss drunk for about 2 weeks straight and have found myself drinking every day since it happened, and haven’t gone without a drink maybe 5-7 days since July. Before this all happened, I only drank on the weekends. Now I can’t even imagine not drinking in some sort of way. 

It stirred me into confusion about my future and if I should even stay in school. It has really deterred my grades and have had many drunken mistakes that would’ve never happened before. 

I knew this became a problem once I started missing work from being too hungover and sleeping through work. I didn’t even tell them I wasn’t coming in, only to continue to drink for the rest of the day. 

All I think about is when I can drink next and how much of my money I am putting towards booze this week. 

I want to figure out ways to curb this. It sounds like I’m becoming an alcoholic and would love some actual guidance from people who may have experience with this. 

Anything helps, thank you.",5

It's been 70 days since my last post, and I now have 110 days sober.  I have learned so, so much.  I've seen some of the lows of cravings rearing up, some of the highs of self-awareness, and as I walk this path it just keeps getting better all the time.  I have so much to say, but you already know it, and this probably isn't the place.  Since I began my journey two of my closest, oldest friends- drinking buddies, of course- have also begun their own walks to recovery, inspired by nothing but the changes they've seen in me.

I am not the person I was 70 days ago, or 110 days ago, or the person I was through 22 years of drink.  I am a new person, more like I once was but mature and confident, and for the first time in my life I understand what it feels like to love myself, to accept myself, to forgive myself, to love others without judgment as well.

The initial step is to stop drinking for a period of time and honestly that's because we're ashamed of how much time and money we've dedicated to drinking, this is the case in mine anyway. It's only then the problem becomes evident as stopping seems far more difficult than just doing it..since Christmas I have reduced my alcohol consumption massively which I'm kinda of happy with, but no where near a normal level.. Im still drinking 8 pints of cider every evening and sometimes more if I have been working. I don't have anxiety and depression, Im out going and confident, I'm not self medicating with alcohol I think I actually love the taste and the effects it does to me.. Although I drink very heavily, I don't blackout or vomit, if I get very drunk I can stop, but my issue is I can't say no to the first one and the 10 that follow after that.. Therfore I justify this in my mind as I'm not an alcoholic as I don't drink in the morning nor do I drink into oblivion.. Suppose I've realised thats bollox, I have been on campral for 6 days and it's made a bit of difference, I'm trying to help myself, and I'm all for one day at a time and any time not drinking is good and any reduction to my normal disgusting amount of intake is good.. But stopping something you love is not as easy as just doing it for me..
20 year love affair with drink... 

It sounds like denial, and I have had horrific experiences with alcohol but somehow i have to gather the will to stop which seems to be the issue.. Day 3 and I think I've done so well I deserve a drink😱 so I'm back on day 1 today..

I’ve realized that over the past two years, I’ve developed a pretty bad drinking problem. It came to a head this past Halloween when I put myself in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. I was at a party and just kept going. I ended up destroying a friendship that night by vomiting all over his couch. I don’t even want to mention what the medical bills are gonna cost me. I haven’t had a drink since then. I consider this a wake-up call. I’ve been drinking heavily for years but this is the first time I put my life in danger by doing so.


I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar position as me and can give me some advice. I’m unemployed and facing homelessness. I do have a job interview coming for a job I’m likely to get, but it isn’t gonna be a lot of money. I’m an English student at a state university - my goal is to become a teacher. I only have two semesters left before I graduate. My grades are stellar; my GPA is a 3.9. My goal is to get into an Ivy league school for my Masters.

My family has a severe history of addiction on both sides. My father has a bad drug problem, my uncle is a huge alcoholic , and so were both my grandfathers. My maternal aunt is an alcoholic, and my maternal uncle is a heroin user. My cousins on my fathers side have all had problems with cocaine and drinking. One of them nearly died from heroin and the other spent years in prison for bringing weed on a plane. Everyone smokes cigarettes..There are many more examples. Addiction is in my blood hardcore; its killed much of my family and is killing more as we speak.

I want to break the cycle. I want to stop being a miserable fuck and make something of myself. I want to live a moral, purposeful life and I need to be sober to do that. I turn 27 soon, so its time to stop messing around and get serious.

What do you guys think?",4

Wife drinking after 1 year sober (this Friday) and is claiming she needs to taper slowly and I don't understand alcohol tolerance.,"Hello,

Thursday: Wife had been sober for 1 year

Friday: Half a bottle of white wine. \~175mL tequila, 100mL worth of vodka nips

Saturday and Sunday Morning: \~200mL tequila, 4 bottles of 7.5% beer

&#x200B;

Today is Sunday, and she asked me to get her alcohol to help her ""taper"". I personally don't think tapering is needed after 2 days - I think this is psychological addiction talking to me. Still, I got her 150mL of vodka (nips) as a compromise. It's about a half a bottle of wine, which should be more than enough to prevent withdrawal effects after two days.

Now she is saying she is fully physically addicted and needs more alcohol (more than 150mL), to properly taper.

Can anyone chime in/verify this with their experience? I'm leaning 99% she's making this up.

It happened because she had me call the police - she thought I was a murderer, and then they took her in an ambulance to the hospital. They forced her to sober up and wouldn't let her leave until 2 weeks of in-patient therapy.

She's fine now and back on antabuse. Wrapping up this thread in case it shows up in search results. Thanks for the advice!

For example we are going to a restaurant with friends and she’s concerned that our friends would feel uncomfortable if I don’t drink with them. So, she’s inviting me back to drinking with her and to see if I can try to control it. Obviously this is all messed up. She really does care about me but obviously not as much as I had thought ? What should I say to her here?

I promised myself and my wife that this was it. And now, she’s pulling me back in. I’m just going to tell her “no” and that if she loves me truly then she has to cope with it.

When she contacts us, it’s always about her, she never asks about us.  She has told us to go to hell and then the next day acts as if everything is fine.

She has already  lost one of her children and is angry at that child because of it.  It’s everyone else’s fault. 

She has been coddled by her parents her entire life, and continues to be.  We believe she is going to try to move in with them, which will shorten their lifespan. 

She has alienated all of us, yet her dad gets mad at us for not checking on her more often. 

She has been fired from multiple jobs, and has no source of income, and has depleted her retirement. 

I believe we need boundaries and let face her consequences. We have been trying to help her for years, she won’t help herself. 

Sometime I feel sad for her and other times I feel extreme frustration. 

I know alcoholism is a disease, but she won’t get herself help. She admits she is an alcoholic, but won’t go to AA.  She says she just needs a better psychiatrist. She wants other people to solve her problems. 

I feel like just cutting her out of my life until she gets help.",17

2020-01-04 07:28:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ejw3aq/losing_my_bestfriend_to_alcoholism/,Losing my bestfriend to alcoholism,"Last night, my bestfriend destroyed my birthday by melting down into another abusive alcoholic rage. This was the lastest escalation in a series of drunken episodes my bf has had at my place.

BACKGROUND 
She has come to view a visit to my place as a place where she could drink herself into oblivion with little to no consequences. And I have to take some responsibility for that I provided a welcoming environment, I didn't discourage her drinking, I ensured she was safe (provided a bed, when it is her and her partner, I give up my bedroom for them). She has always been a heavy drinker or high-functioning alcoholic. Though I, if talking about her drinking with her, never used the term alcoholic, and she always claimed she was not an alcoholic because she could stop an time. Which she did when she found out she was pregnant. But resumed drink after baby was born. She drinks at least every other day and at least a bottle of wine. We used to drink together until I realised how bad things were and I actually lied to her and told her I had gone Tea-Total to avoid the pressure to validate her drinking. Sadly as a result of this lie it didn't reduce her drinking behaviour, I am used as a sober driver and baby minder while she drinks. Her partner, is both a drinker and drug user and enables her drinking behaviour but they also fight was they are intoxicated. Previously at their place her and her partner got into a massive fight while my sons and I were stay. He stormed out and she bullied me into driving the streets looking for him, not to apologise, but to carry-on the argument. And more recently, prior to my birthday, her and her partner arrived at a significant family celebration with the sole intention to get absolutely drunk, and while they didn't argue that night my bf was overbearing, disrespectful and bullying toward myself and another mutual friend. I found this embarrassing, hurtful and vowed I would not allow this to happen ever again. I started avoiding invitations (thus avoiding the pressure to reciprocate), when I did have to drop over, I made it on the way to somewhere else or had an excuse like 'I have frozens (groceries) in the car' etc. I even avoid her birthday by ensuring I was working that evening.

MY BIRTHDAY 
I invited no one over and planned a day with just my boys when I got a message from my bf. I ignored it for several hours in the hopes it would become too late (they would be too drunk to drive) to come out. And when I did reply I told them not to come, that I was having a nice day with my boys. She ignored me and told me they were coming. This meant I had to clean (on my f#$%ing birthday, what kind of friend makes a friend clean on their birthday!!! I jest but this real annoyed me, along with the expectation I would give up my bedroom for them and sleep in the lounge). As soon as they arrived I could tell she had been drinking though I would not have called her drunk at that point. My gift= a bottle of wine and wine glasses... yes that is what tell gave someone who had told them they were Tea-Total. Immediately I was pressured to drink, I did relent and accepted one cm in the bottom of one of my new wine glasses. As soon as she started drinking (again) my bf became clearly drunk, her stories became rambling and repetitive. And she resumed her drunken behaviour of bullying. We settled into watching a movie in the lounge, and she continued to harass her partner telling him to go to bed as if he was a child. It was embarrassing and he found it very annoying, telling her several times to leave him alone because he wanted to watch the  movie. Throughout the movie she alternated between harassing her partner and crawling over me , in my bed for the night, single bed, and telling the same reason why she loved the movie. The result was her partner got really angry and I could not follow the movie and got pretty pissed off too. Finally the movie ended, and they both went to bed. BLISS. For a split second.

They started arguing, after about half an hour. My bf returned to the lounge to engage me as referee (this is a common theme with their arguments, when I am present). Normally I try to be diplomatic and neutral but I am fed up. I told her I thought she was really rude to her partner, effectively saying she was wrong and he was right. This enraged her. She returned to my bedroom to inform her partner on what I had said. Which resulted in both of them returning to the lounge, she is now yelling at me because I am a rubbish friend. They continue to argue and my friend decides she was not staying. Honestly at this point, I was bloody happy by that news. However I live in the country, miles from anywhere so I know this is an empty threat. However they both leave the house and argue outside for about 10 minutes. Her partner returns alone and sits down and watches TV with my older son and myself, we get him a coffee- I have a plan now- once she cools down and returns, I am going to get him to take her home, I don't care how late it is nor how far they have to drive, I am absolute at this stage.

Sadly she didn't cool down as I had hoped. Once she realised her 'walking up and down the highway' tantrum was not eliciting the attention she wanted, she returned to my house to get the attention she wanted by yelling at me, in her rage said something telling.  She said she would have been out looking for me if I had been behaving like her. She meant this scolding comparison to reflect badly upon me, upon me as a friend. Totally unwittingly she made a very good point, I point I needed to hear: I don't behave like her. I no longer drink myself into a vile self-centred bitch, I no longer try to manipulate my friends by throwing tantrums, I no longer fall for that behaviour either, I don't going running after an adult whose sole goal is to have me pandering to their every whim. While screaming at me, she opened the bottle of wine she had given me for my birthday (perhaps they did believe my lie and perhaps she had always intended to drink it, who knows) but I realised the disease was in control and it was feeding itself and her behaviour was only going to get worse. God only knows how, I just knew I was no longer going to tolerate her in my house. I enacted my plan by yelling for her to get out and for her partner to drive her home. This was all in front of my oldest son and in earshot of my younger son, he too is all to familiar with her behaviour patterns, and went to bed mid-movie, but fail to sleep due to the arguing. The exiting from my property went smoothly enough, my oldest and I stood on the deck and watched them leave. I was so relieved, sad and hurt, but so relieved. Both my sons stayed up with me and had a hot drink while we calmed down. We talked about alcoholism, the pointlessness of arguing with a drunk, and the reality that my bf was no longer going to be part of our lives, they were relieved, they have only known her in her heavy drinking/alcohol stage. I, on the other hand, had just lost my bestfriend, someone I had known for the lion's share of three decades.

This morning I sent her a message. 
""I am worried about you. You are so much better than your behaviour, I won't believe for one minute that you are one of the stupid who can't tolerate one person disagreeing with them, one of the stupid who would prefer their friends to lie to them instead of telling the truth. I know you think you have your drinking under control. But last night was frightening. I love you, and I will not lie to you, I will tell you my honest opinion when you ask for it, it is up to you whether you choose to value my opinion but I am still allowed to have it and you have no right to demand I have another opinion. It is conceivable that there will be a time when our opinions are so far apart that we can no longer be friends. Perhaps the time was last night, if that is the case I want you to know I love you very much but I hate your drinking. If our friendship can get past last night, I can't be around you when you drink"" 

She has seen the message but I have gotten what I expect, no reply.",21

I've been sober almost 2 years now. I had dealt with a lot of blackouts, a dui, and totaling my car. I always said that alcohol is only giving me consequences and the fact that I drink shouldn't bother anyone else because no one else is affected. Whatever.

Well, on my 22nd birthday, I went out to a bar and blacked out. Not even remembering leaving the bar. I woke up on some random stranger's couch, and I figured I was crashing at a friend's house. This man had his wife and young daughter there and he was terrified some girl was just sleeping on their couch. I had no idea where I was, how I got there, who was there. I was equally terrified. Thankfully, he let me call my mom and had her come get me instead of calling the police for trespassing. Super embarrassing and I felt so horrible about what I had made that family go through all because I was a drunken idiot. The morning I woke up there, I decided to get sober because my alcohol problem was affecting not only me, but innocent people.

Fast forward to tonight. I bartend at a chain restaurant, and him and his family come to sit at the bar to grab a drink while they're waiting. He obviously recognized me and I heard him say 'she looks different.' There was another bartender so I did not have to have any interaction. I went to the back and started crying and felt like I was having a panic attack. That was the first time in over a year that I was reminded of that situation and it just brought back all the guilt, shame, and embarrassment that I had felt previously when it happened. I also felt embarrassed that they are seeing me in bar setting, and probably assume I'm still drinking. Even though im totally sober 

I apologized profusely after the incident and told him a couple months later that I got sober from that day. It was just really hard to feel like I was going through it again

So me- 37m, 6'3 230lbs, and fit (believe it or not).  I've averaged ~4L/week of hard alcohol for like 8 years.  I 95% stopped drinking 3 weeks ago on a 'whim'- my guts were hurting.  That stopped almost immediately.  

So, my experience so far hasn't matched what i'd believed with recovering alcoholics.  I'm casually tempted to go buy some booze, but it wasn't a huge temptation after the first week.  I've had 1 beer in a social setting a few times, and there hasn't been any impulse to drink more.  I didn't feel bad in the slightest those first few days of sobriety, i felt awesome.  Like, damn i wish i'd stopped years ago.

I've only heard 'once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  I don't want to go back to nightly drinking, but i'd like to get drunk again in the future.  In the right setting.  Based on how i feel today and how easy it was to stop, it seems like it would be no big deal... but i don't know.

How long before my liver recovers, as much as it will?

How typical is my experience?

Is this all indicative that i didn't have a chemical dependency, just a psychological one?

Why didn't i have any withdrawls when i was drinking so much?  Just size and activity level?


I didn't intend to be here, and i'm sure i sound dumb.  Honestly, i'd appreciate any comments, anecdotes, insults, anything.  I don't really want to talk about this with people in the real world because... y'all prolly get why.

I was never the daily drinking type, just a few times a month. Then almost 4 years ago I lost my dad and 8 months later my father in law.

I've had it with feeling like crap all the time and blowing off friends to drink. Tired of the anxiety my drinking caused me. Just tired. So here's to my new beginning!",98

They ask my symptoms every so often and would only give me things like Ativan when the walls were crawling.  

If if upheave too much it makes my chest hurt and I see stars.  Or will choke on my vomit.  

Anyways I am out of ICU but still feel like shit and going to see if can get into proper detox tomorrow.  I am already in an IOP program but I had a relapse over Christmas so I am trying to get better.  And probably jeopardized my new job from not being able to tell them I was in the ICU during it.  

BTW does it also make anyone feel better when they are in fresh air while withdrawling?

I feel like I am stuck in my weird dreams for aeons and when I wake up, only an hour or less has passed. Sometimes I am dreaming with my eyes open, see furniture move, shadows. Even heard a woman's voice in my bedroom. I live alone.
This has never happened before and I am afraid of the night, afraid to close my eyes and afraid to fall asleep.
When I talk to my doctor he would just say ""relax, detox is hard on body and psyche. it will get better."" It just doesn't change the fact, that it's scary and that I feel helpless at night.

Fortunately my days are better than my nights. Although I've got the common cold (the nights were getting worse before I got ill) I eat well, I get lots of fluids and I am kindling my passion for literature. 

Is there anyone who has experienced something similar during detox? Rationally I assume that it could be a sum of all things. Recent break-up, dark seasons, holiday stress, and detox.
but then again I feel haunted.",2

I was a regular drinker until recently. Probably consuming on average 8 units a night. Over time I think this affected my mental health. I had my last drink on New Year’s Eve.

Yesterday I felt a massive sense of anxiety which lasted for a couple of hours or so. I honestly thought I was going to have a panic attack. So many negative emotions came out of no where and I think alcohol was to blame because over Xmas I drunk every day because I planned on stopping on New Year’s Eve. 

Anybody experience this? If so when does it stop. I feel like it’s coming on again. I have no desire to drink by the way, just annoyed at my state of being.

I am 30m, let myself go on a bender that has only lasted 14 days but all my symptoms of withdrawal are bad. I basically drank straight through the holidays and am waking up hurting and In need of support. I immediately got myself back up to like 16 a day? Idk even know I was just getting as much as made me glow so I was making multiple trips to the store, usually 6 drinks at a time, three times a day but for the life of me I couldn’t tell you how many I had yesterday, probably 16. I drink bourbon by choice, cheap beer if I can’t get it.


I called out of work so much this week I probably lost my job, I have two kids who live with me and my wife is furious, I have enough money where not working for a week shouldn’t ruin us but I need to end this. Any ideas on detoxing? I can get into med spot but I’ve been there and it’s three days of misery I’m avoiding because it’ll suck. I feel like I can do this at home because it was a short run, my wife is on the fence, she is well versed in alcohol detox but certainly no nurse and I’ve had some bad symptoms. Worst for me is the hammering heart, I have had some moments in the middle of the night before the packie opens where I’ve prob had some dt symptoms of being delusional and scared but idk, has anyone picked themselves up from bender like this without med detox? Best choice is obviously to make sure I don’t die but hard taper sounds just as bad. I can probably get gabapentin but no benzos to be had. All the other symptoms are there, sweats, shakes but not too critical and some fear/delusional moments where I’m scared of my own shadow and light and loud sounds are scary. Anybody else clean up at home from a bender this short? I’ve been to med detox a few times and I know it’s prob be easier, and everybody’s different but any long term drinkers that fell off and sweated it out after two week bender? I’m done and won’t get to 16 today but my chest is thumping if I don’t get a few in me to start the day and I look like dogs ass covered in unholy stank sweat. I’m sorry for the long post I just had about a year sober and feel like an idiot signing into medical if I can avoid it.",3

30 days of drinking? 

Been at it just about everyday since the week of thanksgiving.  I plan to go the first half of ‘20 completely sober. 

I want to get in the best shape of my life, have several critical moments as a professional, and want to save money! 

Worried however of withdrawals, I won’t experience anything crazy will I? What can be done to alleviate this? 

I had blood work done the week before thanksgiving, all came back completely normal. 

My level of consumption during this period has been 4-7 drinks a day. 

I started a taper after last night 6 drinks, today I had 4, tomorrow 2, Friday, Saturday, Sunday none... 

The discipline isn’t an issue and I could quit cold turkey, but am a little nervous of withdrawals. 

For full history, I was drinking daily 4-6 beers for approx 2 years. Basically all of 2019, I consumed 10-12 **TOTAL** on the weekends. Abstained during the weekdays. Then the week of thanksgiving, the holiday parties kicked off. I think since 11/22 I’ve had only 3-4 off days. 

7 is definitely on the high end above. Using conservative measures. I’d say 6 is near my max. But want to be as honest as possible here and there were some days I stayed around 4-5.

Everybody is different. I’ve found that I was able to quit cold turkey a few times by enduring work throughout a new week. Kept me distracted enough to not experience severe withdrawal symptoms.

The first time i thought it was natural and i didnt eat anything that day and i drank too much vodka. It was 5 yearsago.

Second time was a suprise, i stayed home drinking and wanted to try bulgarian red wine. I collapsed on the floor and have a scar on my chin now. This was 2 years ago.

And yesterday. Yesterday ivedrank 2 glasses blush wine, 3x50cl beer and then 3 more glasses of red wine.
I remember turning off laptop etc. and going to bed but apperantly i couldn't.

I collapsed again and hit my head to toilet. Now i have a red line on my forehead. 

I started to get scared for the future. I don't know if it's happening because of red wine, i looked it up and so it was DRY? idk if thats something that can trigger. 

I love drinking, i was able to drink two bottles of wine or one 70cl whiskeyon my own but now i'm drinking occasionally and this annoys me because i have to know how i should deink if that wine wasn't the problem.

Thank you in advance,

Edit: I'm using Lustral 100mg daily

I passed out three times and idk why, i need to understand the reason to be able to drink responsibly.",1

Alcohol has completely tainted every aspect of my life. The thing is that I saw and knew I had a problem almost 10 years ago. I knew pretty much with my first drink that I was in love with alcohol. The first few years weren’t too bad, before the black outs, the duis, and the humiliation. I basically started partying at 16. Nothing too crazy. I just happened to do it pretty frequently. A couple years passed and it began to get worse. I had moved in with my boyfriend my senior year of high school and my neighbors and friends were all older than me. I began to notice that no one wanted to drink as much as I did. I began to start drinking alone, every night. I’d stay up later than my boyfriend so that I could get tanked. But being 18, i didn’t get hangovers, didn’t get withdrawal, no blackouts, so I didn’t see how I could REALLY have a problem. Eventually We broke up and I moved cross country. That’s when it really started to get bad. I started dating this guy and he also liked to drink pretty frequently. We would both do some pretty dumb shit together. That’s when I first started getting blacked out. I would wake up and all of our friends would be concerned with the fighting him and I did all night at get togethers because we were both so fucked up. I blacked out on Mother’s Day and lost my shit on a bender to the point his dad had to hold me on the ground because I was trying to fight everyone. Instead of getting help and seeing that I had a problem I just left the guy. Blaming him for why those things were happening to me. Shortly after I got my first dui at 21. That deterred me from drinking for about a month or two before I was back at it. I soon after met the love of my life. I had turned to drugs during my sobriety from alcohol and ran pretty deep with that as well. The day I realized how much I wanted him to be in my life I dropped the drugs cold turkey. But I found myself turning to alcohol again. When I started drinking this time around the dr jackal and me Hyde came out more than ever. It didn’t matter if it was 2 drinks or 20 I would almost always black out. Waking up finding out I tried to harm myself, leave, cheat, whatever I could basically do to hurt him. I couldn’t understand why I was doing these things to someone I cared so much for. That’s when I took my first trip to AA. I quit that time for a few months, then began to closet drink again. I don’t know what triggered it exactly. The whole time sober I just could not wait to start drinking again. Long story short I sobered up and relapsed over and over with him. He finally couldn’t handle watching me do that to myself anymore. And I can’t blame him. After he left I basically began drinking 24/7 before work, during work, after work. It was a shit storm of blurred days and embarrassing stories. One day I snapped during a bender. I wound up in the ER with withdrawal and on my way to psych for trying to kill myself while intoxicated. My blood results showed after hours was at a .33. And being a 24 120 lb female is pretty high. I don’t remember much of detox. Just a lot of shaking and sweating. Very cold. I was in psych for about 2 weeks. My parents made the drive to get me settled back at my apartment. The day they left I went out on a bender again. My deceased mother and her father both were alcoholics. Making my grandmother that lived in town with me a pretty big enabler. I went missing for almost a week before I turned up back at the hospital again. This time my stepmom came and told me I would be returning home to Wisconsin with her. I didn’t think it could get worse. It did. I stayed sober for about a month back in Wisconsin before I met my ex. We partied that whole summer I was back. I never really let on to what happened back in the other place I lived. We both drank pretty heavily so it turned pretty toxic pretty quickly. We were on again off again for over a year. Depending on how drunk I would get on our dates. Usually I couldn’t make 3 in a row before I’d make an ass out of myself and we would break it off. That fall I got my second dui. I blacked out and started hallucinating. Drove my car into a ditch and my dad has to call the cops on me because he thought I was going to hurt myself. They were a lot harsher on me this time around punishment wise. I was on prohibition and had to blow randomly once a week. I cracked that code pretty quickly and kept on drinking. The few friends I did make here didn’t stick around long once they saw how much I changed when I drank and didn’t like what they saw. I’ve hurt my dad with the hurtful things I say when I drink. My brother is constantly disappointed in me. I’m getting in trouble at work again. And I can just feel myself spinning again. I haven’t drank in 2 days. And hoping I can make it to a meeting tomorrow. I can’t keep pretending this isn’t a problem and just accept the fact that unless I want to loose everything I can’t drink. But unfortunately I know all of these things and I still go back to it. How do you guys find the strength to just say no? Thanks for listening to my story. I just needed to honestly see it in writing for myself.",26
