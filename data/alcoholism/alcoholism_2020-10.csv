He refused, and without forcibly taking his keys,  I let him drive.

2020-10-30 14:34:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jl2f9q/3_days_sober/,3 days sober!,"Im 40.. ive been drinking on and off since i was 13.. runs in the family.. i remember being 10 years old seeing my dad step out the door fall down the steeps. Endes up in hospital for months because of the weirdest things. He was an alcoholic who was addicted to alcohol. He nearly died to say the least.

Anyways.. been drinking off and on since 13...i went through countless binges ..i lost my grandparents who raised, a nice home..a college education and a beautiful fiance over the cover of 3 years all thanks to addiction mainly. Alcohol.

Cut to the chase... over the last year ive been drinking a pint sometimes 2 of some 100 proof shit. Or i was broke 10 or 15 of 99 airline bottles. Every night since last thurs.

About five days i started to feel extemely sick with terrible anxiety.. i couldnt do anything.  Id drank more to make the terrible feelings go away. Which worked for a few days as it had in the past.. but then i woke up night feeling flush all over my body.. i was scaredd but luckily feel asleep. When i woke i didn't feel like i was me anymore. My entire body ached... especially my back and sides. Diarrhea dry heaves.. didnt know if my organs were shot.. i also had throwt3
I was terrifed and didnt know what to do. I googled these subs forever.. just as i was about to post and ask for advice my brother told me get my shit im dropping you at the e.r.

So i was there from 4pm tues. Till 5 am wed where they transported me to their main hospital.
They have kept me heavily medicated and things have been great for the most part. Asidr from a few rude nurses. The food is terrific.. have a bice bed with tv to myself. Only thing that sucks is no smoking since its a hosptial.

Yesterday after noon things weree really slow.. so i learned how to unhook my iv. .. took the elevator all the way down huffed a cig in the parking lot but i got lost getting back to my room and got a speech from the head nurse she wass nice nut still told me if i left the 2nd floor agakn i was gone.

I still have trouble sleeping they really lay the mefs on me at night
So i got brave and decided to go into the batbroom wheree the shower is and just blow the smoke down the floor grate.

I got away witb it once.. the second time. Got caught but nobody really said mucb other than i shouldn't  be doing that with all the oxygen takes inside the place.

So anyways. I went to sleep.. i thibk it was one of the drugs remeron they gave me idk. Coukd have been that in combo with ambien and ativan and librium i tore odd my iv...and was sleep walking the halls. Crazy shit.

Anyones.. everyone has been fairely pleasant even with my trouble making.

But so far hospital detox has been great. 


Tldr;  if you feel like you need help go to the er. GO. If you need help quiting dont know where to turn GO.  Even if you're like me with no insursnce most all hosptials have programs based on your income. 

I know not all rehabs or hosptial detox wings are foing to be the same as where i am. Food is terrific here btw.  GO  not only can you quit drinking you can also learn anout any other problrns you may have.

I have a question, and im a bit shy about posting it. So, back in June of 2019 to probably June 2020 I was in an abusive relationship and to cope i would drink my ass off every day. Mainly to subvert my anxiety and depression. And quite a lot too. More than two glasses. While I've left my ex and am now dating someone better, I find myself still craving alcohol and while not getting as drunk as often as I used to, I noticed I cant quite...get rid of it. Like im not drinking to enjoy myself, im drinking to divert my depression and anxiety.

Another thing I should mention, part of me was really worried that something was wrong with me, so I would go to AA meetings with a friend from a local crossfit gym. I told my parents about it and they called me pathetic so I stopped going. I never told them why I was going in the first place. 

Sorry if this is a weird question, I just feel so ashamed lately because im reallt worried ill turn back into that person who was getting shit faced every night.

I felt like that'd keep me a little healthier and make me spend a little less money. It worked for a little while.
I gave myself an inch today, and I took a mile.
Tomorrow, I'm planning on getting together with some friends and watching Hot Fuzz, a movie we all love. Obviously this will be a drinking occasion, and I have to go to the gym after work before I show up and won't have a lot of time, so I bought the whiskey today.
And hey, since I'm already at the liquor store, why not get two beers for myself today? It's practically the weekend, so why not?

I drank my two beers, and then I decided it wasn't enough, so I cracked open the whiskey and took a few drinks directly from the bottle. My workday isn't done yet.

I'm not asking for help or advice (though I wouldn't bristle if it's given to me), I guess I'm just wondering why I'm like this when other people can easily avoid it? Why do I have to keep quitting and relapsing and some can just leave half a glass of wine on the table or decide they've had enough?

2020-10-29 12:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jkdjl1/how_can_i_help_my_mum/,How can I help my mum?,"I wouldn’t call my mum an alcoholic, but she drinks more than she should. She has no control about when to stop. She can only buy one bottle of wine at a time, because she can’t stop half way through a bottle. If there is alcohol in the house, she will drink it. Now when this is just one bottle, it’s not so bad, but anything more than that, and though it may be fun for her, it’s not for others anymore (unless they’ve had equally as much to drink). 

She buys a bottle when she feels stressed (by her measure) or if it’s a Friday. Or a Saturday. Or a Sunday. Or a Monday. When she drinks more than a bottle she normally goes to bed and falls asleep immediately. She is much less aware than after just one bottle. She always has an excuse for buying a bottle of wine.

This particularly hurts me because her husband (my step-dad) died in 2017, and he was an alcoholic. He was drinking about 3 bottles of wine per day, and started early in the mornings as soon as he woke up. They used to try to say that his drinking wasn’t what killed him, but ultimately it was. His health was bad due to his drinking, he was on a crazy amount of medication, one of the medications had gave him side effects of being dizzy and he fell down the stairs and had a stroke from the impact of landing on his head. He was 50. My mum will be 50 in December this year. It terrifies me to think about her getting to that stage. 

I just feel she’s not being realistic about the fact that drinking is bad. I feel I’m the only one who says the truth about my step dad. He was an alcoholic and died because of that. No one else will say that (other than doctors in private). If I tell her I want her to get help, I’m fairly sure her response would be to laugh and say she’s not that bad.

Avascular necrosis commonly affects the head of the femur due to its limited blood supply. The head of the femur (thighbone) forms the ball which fits into the cup formed by the acetabulum (pelvis). Any cause which may lead to disruption of the blood supply may cause avascular necrosis (even anabolic steroids can do this). The disruption of the blood supply leads to the death of the bone cells in the head of the femur. The dead bone slowly collapses with time. The overlying joint cartilage collapses leading to an incongruous head of the femur. The loss of sphericity leads to arthritic changes in the cup and the ball. The joint becomes painful and stiff with loss of movement in various planes of motion. The long term heavy drinking is a known cause of avascular necrosis AVN of the head of the femur. When this happens, the patient has to undergo hip replacement surgery. Most patients with alcohol-induced avascular necrosis usually belong to the ages of 50 years and above. The average duration of alcohol intake is usually 8 – 10 years with weekly consumption of 400 ml or more.

2020-10-26 12:23:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jihlsp/am_i_worrying_too_much_about_my_boyfriends/,Am I worrying too much about my boyfriend’s drinking habits?,"Hi everyone. I (24M) am starting to worry about my boyfriend’s (26M) drinking habits recently.

My boyfriend was a heavy drinker in the past before I met him, and sought therapy to help with his drinking problems. He went from drinking every night to cutting down to having just a few nights a week where he’d let himself drink. Due to his heavy drinking in the past, he’s built up a pretty big tolerance to alcohol, and needs a lot to begin feeling the effects. As some background information I come from a family of alcoholics, so this is kind of a touchy subject for me, and something that I tend to worry about more than others.

Normally, he’ll drink anywhere from 1-3 times a week, and his choice of alcohol is light beer (bud light or rolling rock, normally rolling rock because it’s cheaper). I’ll drink with him sometimes, but I really only drink to the point of getting tipsy about 1 or 2 times a month, maybe more if there are events or special occasions where alcohol is served. Having a day out of the week to sit back and relax and get a buzz/tipsy isn’t a problem for me, because I realize that alcohol can be enjoyed safely and responsibly, and it’s nice to have for a fun night if you’re not going overboard.

Currently, I’ve never seen him blackout drunk or to a point where he can’t control his actions, but the amount of alcohol he needs to begin feeling anything is concerning me. During a regular night, he’ll get off work and open a beer, and over the course of around 6-7 hours, will drink anywhere from 12-16 beers before he gets to a stopping point. Depending on our plans for the week or what he feels like doing, this can happen anywhere from 1-3 times in a week. Normally he limits his drinking to the weekend, but this past week had a day off in the middle, so he ended up drinking Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, and each day drank around 12-15 beers over the course of a few hours. I joined him and drank for two of those days, but for me, it takes about 5 beers before I need to cut myself off or begin slowing down.

I’ve tried communicating with him that I would like for him to take steps to lower his tolerance if possible so he doesn’t have to drink so much to feel the effects, and told him multiple times that I have no problems with him actually consuming alcohol, but the amount concerns me. We actually had a pretty big disagreement this past weekend since I didn’t want him to drink too much and he’s getting tired of me acting like it’s a huge problem every time he starts to drink. I’ve told him that even if he has a higher tolerance, drinking that much alcohol over the course of a week is still just as bad if I were to drink the same amount, since ultimately we’d still be putting the same amount of alcohol in our bodies, regardless if one of us feels more drunk than the other.

He doesn’t need alcohol to function, and can take breaks from alcohol without feeling any withdrawal effects or cravings or anything like that. He tells me that he really only drinks to enjoy it and to get a nice buzz going for the night while he watches TV, or does things around his apartment. I told him that I’m fine with him drinking on occasion and having a good time, but at the same time the amount that he needs to feel the effects is worrying me. He doesn’t necessarily see it as a problem because we’re still in our 20s, and would agree with me that he would need to seriously slow down if we were older or if he was drinking every day, but since it only happens a few times a week and he’s in control of himself when he’s drinking, he doesn’t really see a need to slow down or take a break from alcohol to see if that lessens the amount he needs at one time to begin feeling the effects. After we had a little argument about it this week (which is my fault - I was drinking and really should have just let it wait until we were sober because I wasn’t really in the right state to have a constructive conversation), he told me that he won’t drink at all this week, and is working on slowing down more so he can eventually lower his tolerance. I’ve asked a few people and they don’t really see a huge problem with how he’s drinking now, but when I see him drinking 10+ beers in a night, it really makes me worry. I try to look at both sides and I can see that maybe I’m being too worried because of my past experiences with alcohol, but I’ve seen how much is considered the “recommended” amount per week, and he normally ends up exceeding that, which really worries me. Right now since alcohol really doesn’t rule his life or cause any major problems with work, etc. I’m not trying to label him as someone who has a problem with alcohol, but I really would like to see him get to a point where he doesn’t need so much at one time to feel the effects. I’m just really worried about his health long term with the amount of alcohol he’s consuming.

Am I really worrying over nothing/am I letting my past with alcohol abusers cloud my judgement, or am I doing the right thing by asking him to slow down even more to try and lower his tolerance?

Very sorry for the long post. I tend to ramble.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend has to drink a lot to feel the effects of alcohol due to past heavy drinking causing him to have a high tolerance. I’m worried because he’ll drink 10+ beers in a night and this happens 1-3 times a week (normally twice a week). This makes me worry about his health since the amount he consumes weekly usually goes over the recommended amounts. He doesn’t see a problem with it since he doesn’t drink every day, and doesn’t need alcohol to function, but just has a higher tolerance.",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5921644}"

It’s been worse for me before (since my first withdrawal episode abt 2 yrs ago), but I feel little to no pleasure in anything. Not necessarily depression, I know what depression feels like because I’ve had spouts in the past, but a pervasive numbness.

I find little to no joy or pleasure in anything anymore. Joking around, talking to friends, eating, dating, nature, etc. Just perpetual numbness, but I’m not sad nor upset. I just don’t feel stuff now.

2020-10-26 05:11:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jibbn0/trying_to_get_things_right_i_want_to_still_be/,Trying to get things right. I want to still be able to have beers. Just not every single night.,"So the title says it all. I don’t want to continue to drink daily. Here’s a little background. 

Up until 2 years ago when I got out of the business I worked in the craft beer industry for roughly 15 years. So this meant two beers after work minimum and more than likely many more after that. It’s what they do. Since it was such a big part of my life it just sept into all other parts of my daily routine. Plus I love the taste of all the difference styles of beer! Mowed the yard, need to pound a beer. Can’t sleep, have a few more beers. 

So here we are during a pandemic and 6 and a half months ago I quit smoking cold turkey. It wasn’t fun but I did it. Ever since then I’ve just noticed the addiction with beer(alcohol)seems more clearly evident. Like I’ll have 3 and then next thing I know I’ve had 8...Like just a few short hours later. I’ll go from ready to go to bed to hammered very quickly. Now that I don’t work in the industry I definitely drink considerably less but that’s not saying much. 

I’m currently not working because I was in the middle of trying to find out what the hell I want to do when the pandemic hit. So drinking 4-8 beers a day when you don’t have a job rarely makes you feel better about yourself. I’m fortunate to have a loving wife, with a stable job that she gets to work from home. She is a light drinker very much so. Just here and there. Comically like I was in my 20’s. Smoked pot but rarely drank because I felt like I gave up control when I became intoxicated from alcohol. Well now I basically don’t get hangovers but I do get terrible “brain fog”. I often don’t recall conversations etc. from the last hour or two before I fall asleep. Sure we’ll call it “failing asleep”. Its scary, depressing and embarrassing amongst other things. Then my OCD spikes because I’m not accountable and welcome to more depression. 

Just this last week I spoke with my doctor about cutting back and what would be a healthy start. The deal was 4 beers a day this week. 3 beers a day next week. Then 2 max beers a day the next week and onward. Well I did good 3 of the nights. 4 of them I well exceeded. Because of COVID I rarely leave the house. But tonight was band practice. This was the start of week 2(no more than 3 beers a day). I had my 3 beers at practice and it went well. Until I get home and feel frisky and have another. Now I was good and stopped and these were spread out over many hours so I’m not even slightly intoxicated. But I fucked up and had an extra. And still can’t sleep! Did I mention my sleeping pattern is horrendous. If I don’t get drunk, I can’t sleep. So if I drink too much I feel like a failure and if I don’t drink I feel like shit because I can’t sleep...

I do love marijuana in numerous forms. I don’t do it all day and don’t usually consume high amounts. It helps with anxiety, my OCD, and I feel like I’m just a more empathetic person. I also am into psychedelics. Also, low doses. My wife has zero issue with these things. My therapist has zero issues with these things minus the psychedelics. She clearly warned me of risks of psychosis etc. Also she made it clear that the science is just too limited to know the truth on that front as of yet. The point of me telling you that back history is this. I feel like those things benefit me and certainly don’t make things worse for me. I never once just go “if only I could smoke another bowl things will be better”. Never happens. I pretty much just smoke a bowl a day (in the evening) and eat a 15 mg edible after dinner and I’m cool. But it does that with alcohol. I don’t say those words out loud but I’m pretty sure I hear my internal dialogue suggesting things like that. Alcohol is very suggestive. 

So if I have these crutches/tools/substances that I like, seem to help me and are supported by the people around me...why do I choose alcohol? The one that doesn’t check those boxes. Addiction is the answer. That’s why. I started noticing the same thing with cigarettes before I quit. Thoughts like, “why am I doing this thing that I don’t enjoy anymore”? Now I’m seeing that here more than ever and asking myself that very question regarding alcohol. 

How do I fall asleep without intoxication? 

How do I 100% commit to me cutting back?

He always told me I was living in his path which when he was alive was a great path to take but now that he’s gone it’s a dark path ahead. To be honest my drinking problem started fairly young.My parents divorced when I was young and I grew up with parents wanting to be a friend more than a source of guidance, so at the age of 9 or 10 I had my first drink, of course my dad said it was taken so I would hate the taste so much I wouldn’t touch it later... 
A regular drinking routine didn’t start til I was 18, felt pretty basic but I had a couple of nights where I had angry friends because I went too far and made of fool of myself and them. As most dumb 21’s go I got a dwi which actually straightened me out enough from 21 to about 30 which was a nice streak, I met my wife,  bought a home, and truly began life in a positive direction. 
After 30 hit I faced a lot of loss in my family starting with my grandma that I truly fed on for her positive attitude in every situation. When she passed I went into a dark place, one that I could still function, Maintain my daily responsibilities then goto the bottle and drink the pain away. My dad had been sick for years and on dialysis and passed a year ago. He had found faith and peace before he passed so I have no doubt his life had meaning but for me the hole just got deeper. My wife and I had flown back home for his funeral and I was so openly hurt that before the plane left the tarmac I needed a drink in my hand. I was
Hiding morning drinks before coming back to the house days before his funeral and would spend time in the rental crying after I finished my bottle. 
Now, a year after my dads passing I finish a handle

I first heard this song when driving with my mom and I was completely amazed. John’s voice, the guitar, strings, it was a masterpiece. I continued to listen to more and more of the Dizzy Up the Girl album and the more I listened the more I came back to Black Balloon. There was something about it that moved me like no other songs did.

What I didn’t realize was this song was about a girl’s addiction to heroine and the havoc it reeks on the ones that love her. My Dad is an alcoholic and has been for sometime now. His struggle with alcoholism has completely destroyed my relationship with him, and I don’t know why. 

These lyrics almost feel like John Rzeznik is talking about me and my father’s addiction. “You know the lies they always told you/All the love you never knew/What's the things they never showed you/That swallow the light from the sun inside your room”. The more I learn about my dads struggle the more I learn how much it has stemmed from his family. He never felt like he had true love of his identity, so he chose to be a drinker. It always worked for him until it became a problem, and now all of his “friends” lie straight to his face and don’t associate with him anymore. 

I listen to this song and cry now. I have spent many nights wondering if there is something more I can do to save him, I just don’t know. John has perfectly written how addiction affects all those around it. I pray that my dad gets better soon, and I pray for anyone who is struggling with some form of addiction. May you know that you are loved and matter. Thank you John for writing this masterpiece, I hope one day I can tell you how much it means to me.",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4249313}"

My sister is one of the worst alcoholics I've ever seen. She is the definition of a person who has the illness alcoholic. She has been drinking from a young age, we all did back then. As the years went on she has gotten to the point where she would dissappear for days and weeks at a time to the most squalid places to hole up and drink. Recently found her in a condemned house she used to hang out in with a bunch of old hobos. Passed out drunk.. she had been missing 12 days.

Thats just the most recent of hundreds of times she's done this. But the last few weeks have been different. She's spiraling out of control. She has a 13 yr old daughter and 3 yr old son. They barely see her because of her illness and most of the time they're with my father or their father( who is almost just as bad as her.)

Our mother died from the same disease not long ago. Almost 2 years probably. I don't know what to do any more me and my big brother are out of ideas. Proper rehab for her would cost hundreds of thousands we don't have. Insurance covers a couple days in a facility and then your back to it. 

I've been prepared for the news of her death for years just like I was my mother but, i want her so badly to get her shit together and be there for her children. I dont know what to do, i think she's so far gone any intervention wouldn't work, and definitely not alanon.

Does anyone have any tips during the beginning of stopping drinking?
Quick background on me:
I have cut down daily drinking of 10-15 drinks to about every 3-4 days (on the days I relapse I drink about 10-15 drinks). I am prescribed librium to take 3 every day to help with my panic attacks, but I try and take it only when I feel a panic attack coming. I am feeling nauseous during the time in between drinks (which is why I end up relapsing). I feel shortness of breath often until I drink again. I'm 27, 5'10, 280 lbs. I'm working on losing weight in dieting but I really want to start walking and bike riding.

Does anyone have any tips for diet, how to avoid nausea, ways to pass the time, what they did to fight the craving, etc?

I am doing wayyyy better than I ever have been, but I want to make it one week without drinking. But on day 3 is the absolute worst. I feel sick all day and even though I tend to sleep a lot on that day, I feel like I have too much energy and I even start to crave a hangover, which I know is the addiction talking to me but it's hard to shake.

Currently on day 2 and it's hitting me like a train right now. I want to go to sleep but I feel so off. I keep thinking of alcohol but I don't want to fall back in.

A story that relates to my experience:

**There was a certain man who lived along a river. During a terrible storm, his property began to flood up to his front door. He and his neighbors were visited by the local Fire Department and told to evacuate.**

**When the fire truck came to his house, he said, ""I'm staying. My faith is in God, He will save me."" The truck drove off. The man went inside to pray.**

**And so, the flood rose up to the second-floor windows of the house and the man was then visited by a rescue-boat, and again the man told the rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me."" The boat sped off without him. The man went inside to pray.**

**Finally, with the water level all the way to the top of the house, the man was standing on the peak of his roof, and a helicopter flew over and dropped a rope-ladder down, but the man refused, screaming up to his would-be rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me!"" The helicopter flew off. The man sat on the roof and prayed.**

**In time, the flood rose, drowning the man.**

**When the man got to heaven, he was furious that God had not saved him from the flood. He said, ""Lord, I strongly declared my faith, confident that you would save me. Why didn't you?""**

**God said, ""I sent you a truck, a boat, and a helicopter!""**

Today, I'm 10 years sober in Alcoholic Anonymous and so glad I grabbed the rope ladder. The people of AA were the ones in the truck, boat, and helicopter.

He needs to stop bc he is mixing with valium and he is a danger for everyone and himself. It's a nightmare and his doctor basically allowed him to continue?

I’m not an alcoholic to the point of them needing to prescribe me medications to deal with the withdrawals. I don’t like AA and even if there is a local one I live in a small town, people are nosey and I think this is an embarrassing problem to have.
If I come out with a problem like this I’m just the typical (not white) alcoholic.
I am completely alone aside from this chat group I’m in and I don’t want to be super annoying constantly telling them about my recent fuck ups I just want to stop and make this the real last time I’m ever drinking again. I keep getting drunk even though I hate the after effects sooo fucking much that it just leads to me drinking AGAIN.

I used to be skinny, I used to have an eating disorder now I eat too much or get drunk and I’ve gained so much and it fucks with me.

How should I approach the conversation?,"My (36) bf of four years has been a heavy drinker since we started dating. I realized it early on but never said anything because I didn't know what it meant to be an alcoholic. He's a happy drunk who can go a week or so without drinking given the circumstances like when we were traveling with my parents.  When it's within he's means and control he will drink at least 40 beers a week. The last month he's been drinking till he's thrown up a couple of times.

Last night we both agreed to go to bed but I noticed him lingering around the kitchen. I got into bed and I hear him open the fridge and crack open another one. I'm baffled by it. It's not the first time he avoids coming to bed so he can drink more. That's when I asked if we could talk about it. He was annoyed at me and said that he would stop but didn't want to talk about it right now. We're trying to improve our communication so I gave him space and asked when we could discuss it and he said tomorrow evening (which is today, I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep). I can tell he's defensive so I want to approach the subject as carefully as possible. 

My questions are:
* what can I say to be supportive and helpful
* what type of phrases or words should I avoid
* should I encourage him to stop completely or moderate?
* should I step back? I know I can't make him stop drinking but it does affect our relationship since he uses it to cope with stress
* I don't want to make it about me but since I'm the one bringing it up I feel like it can go that way. Any advice on handling this?

This then caused the 2nd time in my life I've had withdrawls: Shaking, tremors, hard to sleep, felt like I was going to stop breathing.

It lasted 3-4 days until I finally felt basically normal. I've only ever experienced it once before. This was probably the worst experience of my life. I was convinced it was because I just literally did 3 straights days of just drunk-hungover-drink_to_cure_hangover, repeat.

I'm in my late 20's, I'm a social drinking. Hate drinking alone, never drink during the week. On weekends we got out and I get decently drunk, not really blacked out safe for a few times.

Now the problem is, whenever I drink literally even once, I begin to slightly feel it. Drinking sat night, the sunday night sleep is kinda rough and I 'feel' it Monday. It's nothing super bad, but I can feel it's there. I'm guessing it's because those bad days are still so recent I begin to feel like I could enter them again by drinking. Maybe it's all in my head. I know the withdrawls/tremors are from your body not having the alcohol anymore, but how could I get withdrawls from literally drinking once a week?

I don't want to quit cold turkey, I've never felt like I have a problem. I'd like to be able to have a few beers on the weekend. I'm debating on going all of November without drinking, to try to reset myself.

Recently my grandmothers health has taken a turn for the worse. I believe she is going to die soon and I’m afraid that if my mother doesn’t get help soon, she will spiral after loosing my grandmother and drink herself to death. 

My father and I have tried to get my mother to go to rehab or ANYTHING many times over the course of my life, but he seems to have given up. He says that he feels like the only option he has at this point is to threaten divorce, but he’s afraid she would choose alcohol over him. 

I want my children to have a grandmother. I want my father to be happy. By most importantly I want to be able to come home to visit. By most importantly I don’t want my mother to die. 



If people have any advice on how to get her to want/accept treatment it is much appreciated. 

I will say it again, my father and I have talked to her about her drinking many times before and she definitely thinks she’s in control of it. She’ll stop for two or three days and then on day four she’ll drink until she’s hardly conscious.

i'm in my mid 20s and i smoked from ages 19-22, quit, and picked up drinking right after. an ex girlfriend who was about 10 years my senior told me when i was 20 that i ""smoked a lot for such a young kid"" .... i think i have a tendency to binge on anything i enjoy doing. i don't need anybody to tell me that i drink a lot now - i know that i do and that it's a problem. i think i use both to distract myself from my OCD and depression - smoking was a ritual i could focus on, and drinking numbs whatever i am anxious about. 

i quit cigarettes by a) romanticizing growing old and telling myself that i will never get beautiful grey hair if i die young from lung cancer, b) chewing gum, and c) convincing myself that cigarettes smell gross. 

now i'm going to try to focus on healing my liver, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, drinking a lot of seltzer and tea, and turning my nose up at the smell of alcohol. i have a half drank cup of wine i plan on leaving on my bedside table until it molds - just like the soggy ashtray i left on my bedroom window for a month three years ago. and maybe with the money i save from not drinking i will be able to afford a therapist.

i've tried to quit before and it always goes like this: the first two days i feel like shit, then i feel great and energetic for about a week & take on a bunch of new projects and try to regain control over my life by spiraling into an OCD nightmare, then something triggers my anxiety and i relapse to self medicate. this time i'm going to take it slow - just because i'm sober doesn't mean i now have to deep clean the house, take up knitting again, and go on a hike every afternoon. i'm going to allow myself to be moody, watch tv, eat ramen, and work on jigsaw puzzles for hours on end. once the covid nightmare is over maybe i'll go to meetings - i tried in the past but my anxiety wouldn't let me. my boyfriend is on board with this journey of mine though so maybe he would come with me. thanks for reading if you got this far.",9,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48456752}"

He owes me money but can drink and smoke every day. He has gone so much as to hide my liquor bottles that he’s finished deep in the trash or another rooms trash can. He drank the liquor I asked him not to. I had brandy that I cooked with hidden in the pantry and the bottle is now empty. I have had conversations on conversations trying to let him know if he’s going through something I’m here or that maybe he has a problem with drinking etc. I’m a nurse and the nurse in me is fighting to want to help but I don’t know what more I can do or take.

Most of my thoughts are compulsive and don't resonate with how I want to be as a person. Stuff like extreme romantic jealousy, not being able to accept that I won't be able to move out of my parents' house for at least another few years, thoughts of suicide that come from feeling stuck.

I won't be able to get therapy until like march 2021 and I can't deal with it alone anymore.

When I go to bed, the thoughts just keep going and end up amplifying each other until I get frustrated and angry. I don't look forward to going to bed anymore. Going outside to drink makes me feel free because I'm not in my parents' house and alcohol halts the compulsive thinking.

It's really hard to convince myself right now that alcohol isn't at least a temporary solution. In the past week I've been drunk twice and I genuinely felt good. I'll probably go outside and drink again tonight.

When he’s sober or just buzzed he’s awesome to be around, he’s funny and uplifting. He’s very helpful and a good guy. But when he gets really drunk a dark side comes out. He’s also rear ended someone luckily it was only a fender bender, he hit and run (even though he denies it) and when the cops came to his house he was sober already. He’s made us worried looking for him. He recently was very drunk and confronted his nieces friend about something he was doing  at a little gathering we had this weekend. My dad has known this friend since the friend was a little kid (they all grew up in the same neighborhood), and he confronted him aggressively so that friend ignored him which led to my dad getting angry and wanted to get violent. Me, my aunt, my cousins stepped in and I got chocked/pushed, my aunt and cousins got pushed. It was chaos. When I tried to talk about it the next day he just focuses on what the friend was doing. I told him he’s an adult, he’s 63 years old he needs to act like it. He said he didn’t see anyone but our friend when I told him about him laying hands on our female family members (including me). This caught me off guard, he’s very protective of me as his daughter so I thought he would be more guilty or apologetic when we did talk about it but it just seemed like he didn’t want to deal with it handle that situation in his head. But it made me feel negatively. He just doesn’t take it seriously and says that’s just him, and I can tell it’s that he doesn’t want to confront the fact that he has a problem. And that’s how he is, he’s not someone who you can get into too many deep conversations with, he doesn’t get in touch with his emotions. He lost his mom as a kid, and then his older brother barely out of high school and subsequently joined a gang which led to a chaotic way of life until he become a truck driver. Although as a truck driver he still get into problems here and there with drugs and alcohol luckily he never lost his CDL. So I know he has trauma that may contribute to this drinking, but he’s machismo and doesn’t wanna see that. 

My grandpa is planning to have a serious conversation with him tomorrow, my aunt and cousins just wanna not include him to try to get him to see the consequences to his actions and I’m stuck not even sure what to do. I want to help him because he’s my dad, but I also feel totally unequipped to handle this kind of situation. I have my own issues with anxiety, and depression and still figuring out how to open up my own feelings to people as well as dealing with mourning issues of my own. And I just really don’t have the strength to convince to him or have better control of helping him.

This is the second time I've came to this board but first time posting and here is why.

Had a few friends round on Saturday including one who I haven't physically seen in like four years so we all get pretty drunk it's like 5am people are leaving/passing out but myself and the friend I hadn't seen in years decide to have an all night sesh then he leaves early afternoon and I decide to continue to drink but at a much slower pace you know just enough to keep the hangover at bay but I ended up over doing it, I had a job interview yesterday and I threw up like 3 times before that even began, I haven't really eaten anything since yesterday either I'm just drinking water and hydration sports drink and I'm still very hungover.


So after that fiasco I'm going to cut down or probably stop altogether for a while or so then start off small with something like Smirnoff Ice, I also don't drink by myself it's only with others so I guess with round 2 of the lockdown in Scotland I won't have to worry about meeting/drinking with friends anytime soon

Apologies for the wall of text but I feel context matters and needed to get this off my chest and hopefully someone here can offer some advice or their own story.

So I blamed it on toothpaste and bread like usual. And her thinking it will be ok in an hour I knew it would be more like 8 to 11 hours to reach .026 which allows me to drive with the IID. So I feel completely sober, I change the oil in my jetta and took my son for 2 mile walk. Now I test myself with my little device and I'm at a .11 and only 1 an half hours had elapsed. 

Which left me highly confused because alcohol leaves the body at .015 an hour. So I go inside and eat exactly this; grits, butter, eggs and mustard also maybe a hint of olive oil. My wife leaves of coarse complaining about the machine, meanwhile I'm freaking out cause she sept asking me to start the jetta which has the IID. 

Long story short, I blew a .11 and not even 2 hours later after a nap and some food I blow a 0.00

I haven’t gone to many meetings recently at all, and I feel like it’s more triggering actually attending the meetings, but I don’t know if this is just me pushing myself away from the meetings, and I do in fact need to start speaking in the actual meetings to other members and do a share. I am not sure whether this will help and whether it would get the idea of the meetings being triggering out of my mind? Has anyone else felt that AA meetings are more triggering?

I am determined to recover and am hoping for alternative ideas/resources to assist with a more personal recovery plan and to see if others have struggled with similar circumstances.

&#x200B;

To preface, I don't have any form of physical dependence or health issues and I am NOT seeking medical advice. Just trying to get a feel for other people that have had to do some of this work independently.

I have spoken with several rehab programs and they continue to lump into a general category (it is unfortunate that these programs seem to have implicit biases that contradict their ""individualized"" treatment programs). I am unable to do inpatient programs for a variety of reasons. My treatment team and family and friends are all on board with my determination to live a healthy lifestyle. I don't feel lying to these programs is in my best interest and I continue to ask them to meet me half way (my brother is willing for me to move in with him while I seek intensive day treatment) but they all seem to be inflexible.

I'm nothing but determined and dedicated to follow the path to recovery though. I'd really really really love to just get into an intensive outpatient program but that doesn't seem to be likely with my unwillingness to go along with inpatient or residential treatment stuff. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any resources for online workbooks or worksheets to complete throughout the day for self learning. I have a strong background in DBT and am particularly interested in techniques that utilize those skills. I am also wondering if anyone knows of groups that assist with skills building or something to that effect... I have attended some AA meetings but the setup doesn't really seem like it's suitable for just attending different ones all throughout the day due to the repetition of how meetings are conducted.

I'm going to look for DBT group classes for structure and consistent access to skills that help with discipline. Just wondering if anyone else has struggled with this stuff and how they got past it.

I am disappointed by how these facilities and treatment teams seem to lump everyone together into an oversimplification of substance abuse.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5333994}"

My fiance invited me to hang a deer stand with him in the woods today. I wasn't thrilled. I was looking forward to watching Mad Men, and to say I'm not outdoorsy would be a huge understatement. But I wanted to spend time with him, so I agreed. As we were getting ready to leave, I totally got triggered by an opened bottle of champagne in the fridge. I could had easily drank it without fiance knowing. It would make our little walk in the woods so much more enjoyable to be slightly buzzed. I was so close to chugging the bottle... when I decided not to. I knew it wouldn't make the walk more enjoyable. It would just make me a bumbling, numb idiot.

Flash forward an hour later, we're in the woods and I need to walk back to the car. I somehow missed a turn, and guys, I totally got lost in the woods. No phone, no map. Just 77 acres of endless trees. I started panicking. At one point, I was just yelling my fiance's name, but he was so far away he couldn't hear me. I nearly twisted my ankle, because I stepped on what I thought was solid ground, but it was actually a hole covered with leaves. The whole walk was treacherous and I almost fell more than once. It was horrible. Finally I took a few deep breaths, somehow reoriented myself, and started walking south. After 30 minutes, I finally found our car (yay!)

If I had been buzzed (or drunk) I honestly don't know what would have happened. There's no way I would have found the car. There's no way I would have stayed calm (which I barely did soberly.) There's no way I wouldn't have just sat down and cried. There's no way I could have soberly navigated the ground. I can't stop thinking about it. If I had drank that champs, I either would still be out there waiting for my fiance to hopefully eventually find me, or more realistically, I probably would have fell. I could have hit my head or twisted an ankle.. or God knows what else.

This is a long intro I posted to a support group yesterday, without getting a single reply. It felt amazing to share a bit of my story and journey, but it still left me feeling so alone.

To anyone that takes the time to read it all, I greatly, greatly appreciate you. Thank you!

""Hello,

I am 3 months sober today. I have been sober 9 of the last 13 months. The pandemic gave me an excuse to break, which led to me being in the same old fog of alcoholism, without any of the ""fun"" I used to think there was in it.

I am 34 now, and still remember turning 30 and thinking that I'd finally quit. That I was so lucky to have never gotten a DUI. That I was so lucky to have never killed anyone. That I was so grateful I wasn't going to give myself another opportunity to die.

But, I didn't quit then. I continued living in my comfortable fog of shame, regret, and embarrassment. I would drink every night of the week, blacking out more than half of the time. I would frequently wake up the next morning, peak out the blinds to see if anyone was around, and then ""casually"" walk in circles around my car to see if I hit anything.

When I turned 30, so many areas of my life improved. I was really focused on reading, learning, and practicing being a kinder person to others and myself. The number 3 is my favorite number, and I actually really looked forward to turning 33. I had an honest feeling that it was going to be the best year of my life. I felt that I had been working so hard at it all. My career was getting better and better, and that was in huge part thanks to the drinking and networking.

Leading up to 33, I had started to feel something was really wrong. My blackouts had gotten more intense. I couldn't remember any of the night before. At all. Not even with any hints or reminders. The people, places and phrases were all gone. And then, they kept getting worse. My blackouts were taking memories from before I had even started drinking the night before. I felt that I was killing a part of me and my body was just floating around at night.

I felt so much shame, and embarrassment that I all I wanted to do was drink it away the next night. And I surrounded myself with people that were happy to oblige, but didn't suffer in the same way. I was a happy drunk to them. A kind, sincere, and fun drink. Super empathetic and insightful. Someone they could rely on, as I faded away.

The tipping point was when my mother and brother came out to Austin to visit. It was just the three of us growing up, and it was exciting to have a sense of that again, even though my brother and I hadn't been close in a long time. I had a rough idea of something I was going to propose to them when they got here, but didn't really think they'd go for it.

I didn't have any tattoos and this image kept popping up into my head of 3 hearts overlapping and merging into each other. Different sizes to represent the three of us. Before I could even finish telling them the idea, they had huge smiles on their faces and said, ""let's do it!""

So pounding beers and shots for inspiration, I drew and drew until we had settled on a design we all loved. We went down to the shop, got an estimate, made an appointment, and it felt like we couldn't have been happier.

After that, I took them to the lake to set up hammocks and hang out, and we picked up beer and food on the way. We each got a different 6-pack to try, and I got one with the highest alcohol content.

Lounging in the sun, my 6-pack disappeared. My mom was still sipping on her first one, so I started to move on to the other 5.

I remember being behind the wheel thinking I shouldn't be driving. Thinking that my brother had had too much. That my mother would be anxious and get lost. That I was fighting drifting left, then right, then left, then right. That I was the only one that could get us home. That I absolutely, 100%, should not be driving.

I woke up a few hours later in bed without any memory of getting home. My mom and brother were napping. All was fine, and no one but me knew that I had almost killed us all. I had always known I could kill myself, but I never thought I would take my family down with me. That shook me so incredibly hard, so I drank.

The next day, we got our tattoos. I'd excuse myself to the parking lot to chug beers while it was their turn, and then come back in smiley and glassy eyed. Afterward, we went on a sight seeing boat cruise that I don't remember, but I made my mom drive us home that time.

Their flight was the next day. I was so sad to see them go. I felt like I had finally had the family I had always wanted. The one we didn't really know how to be when we were younger. The kind that just wanted to shower each other with love and ignore any problems or deficiencies.

It was the second time I told my mom I had a drinking problem, and that I didn't want her to worry, and that I was going to work on it. After I dropped them off at the airport, I went home and blacked out.

The next morning, crying all alone, I decided that I was going to start my ""Sober October"" early. It was mid-September. I was dealing with withdrawals right away, and didn't know what to do with myself. I had heard great things about a show called ""The Good Place,"" and decided to throw that on. I didn't stop watching for days. The only time I'd pause it would be if something really pulled me out to cry about. Most of the time, I'd cry while still following the story.

The show gave me so much strength, and compassion and forgiveness toward myself. I became a huge fan of Kristen Bell and the honesty in her character.

After that, I started exploring podcasts. I had already subscribed to a few self-improvement ones, but needed something a bit lighter. I guess podcasting is a small world because I began to notice that the same guests would go on the same top podcasts, and they'd reference each other, and they led me to check out Armchair Expert. Nothing more incredible has happened in my life.

Dax's open honesty about his addiction and recovery, his reckless past and powerful insights, and intense need to be the best person he can be were everything I needed to hear. Being a high functioning person I needed to hear that it was okay to say I fucked up aaaaaaaaall that time, and that I was going to change that now.

Fast forward to this second stint of sobriety and I couldn't be more proud of myself, or more alone. My friendships have exploded now that it's so clear to me that I've allowed myself to be taken advantage of this whole time. That I made it my duty to sacrifice myself for others. That I'll always be there for you, but you'll never have to be here for me. That I will search for and respect your boundaries without you having to say a thing. But after asking you twice, I won't ask a third time for you to stop disrespecting mine, and we'll just ignore it.

Yesterday, in an honest attempt at asking for help and support, I reminded my brother and my mother that today would be 3 months for me. That I was so happy. That I finally feel myself again. I sent them Dax's podcast where he opens up about relapsing after sixteen years, to give them a broader idea of what I'm dealing with. My mother said it was powerful and she had so much to learn, but wanted to support me. My brother didn't reply at all.

Today, neither of them said anything. I don't know that I feel more alone than I've ever felt, but it's much clearer in sobriety to see that I truly am alone. I fostered the wrong relationships all this time and in this bright moment in my life, I have no one to share it with other than my dog, Dax.

But, today, that's more than enough. I actually signed his adoption papers the day I got sober again. I have no urge to drink because my mind is clear, my heart is full, and I am hopeful of the life I'm building every day I wake up sober.

All that to say, I'm here to know that I'm not alone.""",8,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7338928}"

Short Poem I wrote about my addiction and my recovery. Feedback is welcomed!

&#x200B;

What am I chasing at the bottom of the bottle?

Whatever it was by now I've surely swallowed. 

Now my body is heavy upon waking as I just crave relief

My wallet is light from chasing my high by any means

 My moral compass changes as I run low on funds

Now I'm contemplating doing things I never would have done. 

I hear a voice in the back of my head saying ""Stop this isn't you!""

But I've already gone so far I respond ""What else do I have to lose?"" 

I'm just another addict who resorts to the bottle when I'm in pain

but how much longer before I'm dead or decide to change? 

Through wasted times I have lost my purpose

Even the thought of life, well, it makes me nervous. 

The bottle was a thief robbing me of peace

attempting and failing to use any substance as a release. 

I've been filling a void for so long the old me is lost

Now though each day gets clearer and I'm no longer engulfed in a fog.

 With help I don't need the bottle to satisfy although at times I still think I do.

I'm being taught that once I get it and the high passes I'll just be back to craving something new.

 I lived as an extension of the bottle but am now finding a new identity

Knowing now beyond any doubt if I start using again my using will embody me 

The success I am aspiring to is now within reach, but I'm still hungry for more

so I keep going to every meeting letting fellow recovering addicts move me forward.

I tell myself that I've got to stay sober and I know I can ""one day at a time""

Those 5 words are what I grasp onto when it feels as though I'll lose my mind. 

All those past years I had spent wasted never essentially went to waste,

for they can be put to use as an example of how not to live my old way ",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.495786}"

I 25(m) recently moved into an apartment with some empty bedrooms in a new city. Halfway through September the landlord moved in a girl the same  age as me. There was weirdness and issues from the first night. We had some drinks and it turns out she’s a recovering alcoholic that just recently got out of rehab. She told me about some trauma she’s experienced and how a few months ago she got out of a bad abusive relationship.

Third night she got drunk and trashed our apartment. I begged her to go to bed but she wouldn’t she yelled and swore at me and was angry with me.

She’s the sweetest person on earth when she’s sober. So shy, so skittish, dead silent at all times of day and night.

The second weekend she disappeared for two days and her cell phone was disconnected. I called the police because I was afraid something had happened to her. She acts really when she drinks and sometimes disappears randomly with no explanation. I found a note in her room she had written saying she thinks her ex boyfriend sent someone to murder her. She ended up coming home a few hours later and it turns out she was at work for a temp agency the whole time.

Two nights later she got drunk and was angry. She shoved me into a wall and punched me. She yelled and swore at me a lot. I spent four hours trying to get her to call down and ended up spoon feeding her in bed like a toddler until she passed out. Finally went to bed around 1 am and overslept for work.

I have a long history of abuse and trauma and substance abuse myself. I’ve been physically, sexually, emotionally, abused by women A LOT. I told her the next morning I wouldn’t stand for her abuse and that if anything like that happens again she will have to leave. She was so remorseful. She’s always remorseful. She just has an extremely hard time regulating her desire to drink and do drugs. When she’s on drugs she’s antisocial but not mean. When she’s drunk she becomes an explosive ball of irate uncontrollable emotion.

Both my parents are alcoholics and I’ve had to abandon them. I am an alcoholic too but not as bad as the three of them.

I try to give her plenty of space. We usually talk for a bit at least once a day.

The problem is that I find myself falling deeply and passionately in love with her. I don’t understand it. Her presence makes me feel extremely emotional. We’ve cuddled very briefly about three times. She says she doesn’t really want to because she’s afraid it will turn sexual and ruin our living arrangement. I can’t help but feel that she’s already done everything that can ruin it.. we talk almost daily about whether or not she needs to move out.

I asked her if I could take her out for dinner next week when I get paid and she said yes.

When I look her in the eyes I see myself in a dark mirror. I see my past. I see my mom. I see my exes. I see my friends I couldn’t save in the past.

She’s so poor. I give her money sometimes to go pick up food for us to share. I gave her 40$ to hook her phone up so I wouldn’t have to worry about her all the time.

I make really good money so this isn’t an issue, but don’t want her to take advantage of or become dependent on me. She’s pretty respectful of it and always offers to pay me back someday but I’m just happy her health is looked after. She’s so sad. All she does is lie in bed 24/7 and cry off and on. I give her a hug sometimes. She never shows up to work even when she says she will. I just feel like she needs to someone to believe in her and be patient with her while she tries to get herself and her health together.

I’ve only known her 3 weeks but we’ve become really tied up in each others lives. Or maybe I just have in her’s...


I find myself becoming irresistibly drawn to her. I think about the feeling of holding her nonstop.

I also work from home so we basically are together 24/7. Though she mostly just stays in her room. But she never closes her door which I don’t understand... even when she sleeps. Most people who want privacy keep their door closed.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7563981}"

I used to be so bad I was drunk 24/7.  I tried rehab, in patient and out.  AA.  CR.  CBT.  I am now down to maybe weekly slips.  I feel like success is based on going cold turkey...

Has anyone successfully tapered themselves into sobriety?  Or does that just not work for people like us? I try to tell myself I am in a better place than I was...which is true.  I feel like I did not become an alcoholic overnight and it isn't going to happen overnight to reverse this.  

Maybe from this I can move to once a month to once a semester.  I find the longer I go without the less the craving is.  But every time I try to stone cold never drink again cold turkey, when I do have a slip, it ends up become a full on blackout for days at a time.  I think I need to keep in the mindset of ""One day at a time"" and ""I will not drink today, I will think about that tomorrow"" every morning instead of ""today is another day that you will not drink"".

Everything seems to be going well, mood is generally upbeat, and I love life, would NEVER go back.

My brother is a binger, going a few weeks sober but always then spending a few days in a row wrecked on whiskey.

When I was YOUNGER, I drank a lot. Daily, til the point of oblivion. In 2014, I had mild fatty liver but everyone told me it wasn’t a big deal so I ignored it. In 2017, I was told my liver was extremely fatty and had a  biopsy done. These were my results : 


Moderate to severe steatosis without features of steatohepatitis
-Negative for fibrosis versus cirrhosis
-Negative for peri-portal lymphocytic or plasmacytic infiltrates
-Negative for increased iron deposits

Note: Examination of the biopsy reveals a predominantly macrovesicular steatosis. Approximately 50% of the liver tissue is involved by this process. Features of steatohepatitis such as ballooning degeneration, lobular infiltrates, and Mallory hyaline formation are not identified. Examination of the portal tracts does not reveal a lymphocytic or plasmacytic infiltrate. Trichrome stain is negative for periportal fibrosis, bridging fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Additionally, pericellular (chickenwire pattern) fibrosis is not identified. Causes of steatosis include obesity, diabetes, and reaction to drugs (such as corticosteroids and alcohol). Correlation with clinical history advised.

My gastroenterologist 
 put me on Metformin and told me to not drink as often. I asked him if I can ever drink again and he said yes of course it’s fine to drink, just be mindful. No more daily binges! Try to keep if on the weekends only. So I said okay but was wary.

So I went to a second doctor. This one was was a hematologist, specializing in liver health. He LAUGHED at me and told me my results aren’t anything to be worried about, told me I can drink and said “you’re young, you’ll be happy to know you can still party don’t let these results scare you” and I should just lose 5 pounds and I’ll be fine. And he told me to get off Metformin, that I’m too young (I was 24) to be in lifelong medication. 

So I got off the Metformin.

I wasn’t drinking much. Maybe once a month? At most? And just a few drinks. I hardly drank. And I went vegan during this time. I lost the 5 pounds, and went on with my life.

This year, in January, I went to get a blood test to check on my liver enzymes, and they weren’t fine, no longer elevated. But I got an ultrasound (not a biopsy) and my results said I have fatty liver, that my liver is 16.5cm and echogenic. 

I went sober for 9 months, kinda did a cleanse. I even went to an AA meeting. I realized I’m not an alcoholic. I didn’t crave alcohol or have withdrawal or anything. 
But now I’m starting a new job and it’s extremely stressful so I like to have a drink or two every now and then. I’ve drank 7 times in the past 2 months, which is more than usual- but it’s all been like 2 drinks. 

According to both doctors, this behavior is okay. According to Google, this behavior will give me Cirrhosis and kill me.

What I’m confused about is why I’ve had fatty liver for 6 years straight, why it’s still not going away even after sobriety when everywhere says it can be reversed, and why my doctors don’t seem to be worried when Google acts like it’s the worst thing in the world.

I want to go out for a drink tomorrow, but I’m scared I’m gonna get Cirrhosis and die from my fatty liver that won’t heal. Can I get cirrhosis even if my enzymes aren’t elevated? 

I was thinking that maybe it’s my weight? Do you think maybe I should just go ahead and lose weight? 20-25 pounds? Can I still drink casually while losing weight? 

I don’t wanna die, especially not of cirrhosis, but I also don’t want to just never drink again especially because my doctors say that I can??? 

I’m just really confused and I’m tired of people either fear mongering me or people brushing me off.

my brother is having a very difficult time with his drinking. he lost his job due to covid and had to move back in with our mom, where he has taken to spending all day in his room watching tv before he gets drunk by himself. two nights ago, we were hanging out, playing board games and having a couple of drinks. it felt normal and fun and he seemed to be back to himself. an hour later, he began to blame me for ruining all of his relationships. he told me that i ruined everything and swung between sobbing uncontrollably, laughing and then yelling at me. our mutual friends are worried about him, telling me that he gets blackout drunk and upset every time he hangs out with them which isn't often as he does not answer his text messages and does not pick up calls. he has threatened to kill himself once when he was with one of our friends. he lost his drivers license because he hasn't paid a fine, but this can be easily fixed and he hasn't done it so he is stuck at home and can't drive himself to hang out with people.

he has not had an easy life. he is a single dad and the mom of his child lost custody to him due to heroine use (he is not and never has been a user).  he blames himself for this, and blames himself so hard for everything even when it is such a minor infraction...he began to drunkenly sob the other night when he forgot my friend's name, calling himself an embarrassment. i tried telling him that everyone forgets people's names when they first meet, tried being calm. minutes later he was jovially talking to me, and then minutes after that he got upset again. i live across the country from my family, and i am just on a week vacation to visit. from what i have heard, this isn't the only time this has happened, but i am not here most of the time.

my mom has not taken action and i don't want to agitate him into doing something stupid. alcoholism runs in my family: my dad lost custody of us as children because he was such an intense alcoholic and after 20 years of sobriety he was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis c, which he has now recovered but very nearly died from.  no one has gotten hurt, but i worry about his daughter who he is barely spending time with because he's isolating himself so hard. i don't know what to do to help him and i need some suggestions. he's my brother and i can't stand by while he does this, but i don't want to send him spiraling and i need my parents to help since i can't be here. i'm open to suggestions, thank you.",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8603847}"

After discharge, you still have intense pain and they prescribed me high dose Tylenol which is useless.

So ill take a few hits from a low dose THC or CBD pen sometimes for pain. Doesn't do much, but it's better than nothing. To me, this is my sobriety.

I plan on keeping this going because booze isn't worth it but living is. I cant bare the thought of going through a serious case of pancreatitis again (although one time it happened I was almost four years sober at the time) Plus, my wife needs me. Now more than ever.

My favorite season has arrived, and I've gotten back into my main hobbies instead of drinking every night(photography and woodburning) I feel better than ever and thats all that matters.

You can all do it too. Find something you love doing, even if you aren't good at it. And remember that the people around you want and need you to be healthy. You can't help others if you can't help yourself.

Hi!

I haven't had a drink since September 1st. This is the longest time being alcohol free. My family has some history of alcoholism - my grandfather drank his mind away, my father was an alcoholic for most of his life, but hasn't had a drink in maybe four or five years. Also on my mothers side there have been some alcoholics, so you could say I have a good amount of predisposition to alcoholism. 

I'm your usual ""I don't have a drinking problem"" type of alcoholic. I would drink to excess on weekends and on vacations, but never admit loudly that I have a problem. I turn to a real asshole when drunk, and can't stop drinking until the shops are closed and would run to the liquor store 5 minutes before closing and buy large amounts of beer. And yeah, I would say I'm just having some fun with my friends and family and I'm totally not an alcoholic.

Now after this month of sobriety I feel like my brain finally works as intended. My mind is clear, I feel great waking up on Saturdays. I don't miss the hangovers at all.

Although I feel good and don't really even want to drink I miss having ""fun"" on the weekends. My girlfriends family still drink on weekends and just talk and laugh and do silly things, and it looks like they're having fun and I kind of feel like I'm missing out. I have rejected going out with my friends because they want to just go out and drink and see where the night takes them. Plus I can't really stand other people when they're drunk. Don't get me wrong, I like my friends and family, but when you're sober and someone drunk starts a ""deep"" conversation with you, you just can't keep up with them. It's like being in another world. 

And now my mind keeps telling me - ""go ahead, have a drink, you've earned it"". I don't really want to have a drink, but it looks like they are having fun and I'm missing out. But I know I will go off the rails again. Maybe first day I drink just one or two beers. Then I let my guard down and next thing I know it all starts again.

What the hell are you supposed to do on a Friday night if you don't drink (this might seem a bit narrow-minded)? It's been one of my only ways of having ""fun"" for the past 10 years or so. Any suggestions?",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.417236}"

I'm worried I'll be seen as controversial and divisive, or worse, that I am not acting in good faith. I really am trying to stop drinking, though, at least for a sustained period of time.

Here are the issues I am running into with my sobriety.

For a while, I drank basically daily, sometimes just 3-5 drinks, sometimes much heavier binging. Honestly, I have probably been a binge drinker (that variety of alcoholic) with periods of more intense daily drinking for the past 13 years or so.

Anyway, since Covid, I have done so much better! I no longer drink daily. Usually closer to every other day, with some weeks where I drink a couple days in a row or abstain for a few.

The first day is usually pretty easy. Since I don't drink daily anymore, I don't really get withdrawals, my hangovers are usually not bad (provided I eat the night before), and I'm even getting better at having a few and stopping myself from continuing.

However, I still binge at least a couple nights a week, sometimes up to 4 nights (about a 6 drinks to a pint of hard alcohol on those days).

The hardest moment for me is nearing the 48 hour mark.

The time begins to crawl and I try to tell myself to do anything but go to the liquor store, but it's so hard when the other voice is saying ""you're just getting a few shooters to pass the time, look how much better you are doing! It's ok to drink in moderation, that's what you are learning how to do!"" -- And that is some poor rationalization

The improvement is consistent and has lasted most of the year, I just wish I could push past that 48 hr mark regularly and make it to a week or a month.

The most controversial part of my post is coming up next:

Please don't recommend AA. I have no issue with therapy, or support groups, but I have a huge issue with AA's philosophy toward surrender and metaphysical belief, and many of the steps seem a bit cult like to me. There is also this situation- I don't really act out much when I drink. Sure, I've drank my roommate's booze during a bad bender, but that's about as bad as it has gotten. I don't have big ammends to make. I mostly know to keep to myself in that mode.

I looked into SMART recovery- it also said it had some steps, but I couldn't actually find what they were- if someone knows I would love to hear what they are.

I am very skeptical of organizations that offer help to people who are desperate for spiritual, emotional fulfillment that they are not getting in their lives and looking for in all the wrong places because I have had bad experiences with other institutions that cater to that crowd and I know how easily they can mess you up.

I am definitely not interested at all in AA for those reasons.

But I would love some kind of situation where I can talk and while away the time while I wait for my partner to come home from his 12+ hr days while I am at home alone.

It's between 3-6pm MST when time begins to stand still, and we're about to round the bend.

I guess I am hoping someone might have some suggestions.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50329155}"

i just recently got out the marine corps and obviously drank a lot when i was in. now that im out, i still drink every night like it was normal and function pretty well. but on some nights i get off work too late or feel too tired for my usual drinks so i lay down.

now this is a recent problem, but if i dont drink my heart pounds, i feel like i cant breathe and i cant sleep which i self-diagnosed as a panic attack. even if im dog tired. so today i got back up out of bed, and started drinking again to feel a level of intoxication and the feelings cease. i could probably sleep now.

now theres extenuating circumstances - i just went through a big life change, i sleep on a couch to avoid homelessness, and i went through a bad breakup a week ago. but i cant shake the thought that the root problem may be that drinking is the primary cause of my issues with sleep.

2020-10-01 06:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j365k6/colleague_drunk_at_work/,Colleague drunk at work?,"Hey fellas, I’m not sure this is the perfect place for me to post this (new to Reddit) but here we go. 

I think my colleague is drunk at work. Not every day, but dedinitely a couple days a week. My other colleagues have also noticed, and we have talked a lot about the matter over the last year or so, without coming to any crystal clear conclusions or solutions. 

We work at a local theater which focuses on children between 10-20 years old, we do plays, theatrical excercises, etc, in groups of 5-12 kids, between 3-9 pm.

The colleague in question (let’s call her M) is a 55 yo or so female, divorced, with a 17 yo daughter who has had mental issues for a couple years. The daughter has apparently cut herself, had periods of bulimia, and overall depression. M talks about this sometimes, and we have understood that the mental unhealthiness of her daughter has trickled over to her also - which is of course understandable. 
M has previously in her worklife been a rather successful theater director, having worked at a couple quite well reputed theaters around town, the most recent for which she took leave of absence for two months in the middle of semester to do (imagine the amount of extra hours for us others to cover up all her groups, all the rehearsing she should have done here).
This is a woman with half a career behind her - both at theaters around town, and also several years at ours, but it is clear that she views ours as a substitute for what she should *really* be doing. 

The boss is well aware of M’s flaws and strangenesses. Unfortunately, since we are a municipal theater, and due to our country’s laws, M can’t be fired unless something completely drastic happened, like for example if we should catch her in the act of drinking at work. She seems to have more routine than that, though.

Yesterday afternoon we in the staff had our weekly meeting, going over this and that, events coming up, our groups, and many other things. We also had some kind of sharing (you know sharing, you talk about everything that happens in your life and the others are just supposed to nod and be quiet). During this sharing, M stated that her life and that of her daughter is finally looking bright again. The daughter has a boyfriend and is in love, the self abuse has stopped, and M herself has found a good shrink. 

However, throughout the entire meeting, we all noticed M acting very strange, like a mixture of Altzheimer’s and an afterparty at 4:45 am. It came to the point where it was exceedingly hard to proceed with the meeting at all. She repeated herself endlessly, she couldn’t keep her focus on the matter at hand, tried to make every serious matter into a strange joke, or just plainly didn’t understand what us others were talking about at all. Her gaze was erratic and she smelled veeery strongly of something - hard to tell if it was alcohol or something else to cover up the alcohol. Even if she had been a 24 yo man who just got started as a theater teacher, (i.e yours truly) this would have been a strange and irritating behavior, but for someone in her position, it’s just straight bizarre.

After the meeting, M and the boss had a talk. It was just the two of them but the boss told me afterwards what was said: she confronted M with seeming off and strange, and she even asked if M was drunk. M responded ”noo, I’m just happy.” Then they proceeded to talk for over an hour about how her work was proceeding, and no other valuable information seemed to be given.

Right now, us in the staff are at a loss. If she is drunk, she of course needs help, not just for her own sake and ours, but also for the sake of the kids she works with. And of course for her daughter, but that seems too far off for us to help right now. If she tells the truth, and actually isn’t drunk, what is the cause of her behaviour? Is there some anti-depressant pills that she is on? Why won’t she tell anyone about them in that case? 

Ok, so this is where r/ comes in. You seem wise in the arts of decoding alcoholism, and maybe you could advise me in some direction here? What would be a dead giveaway in her case? Is there any trick to test the nature of a person’s addiction? If it turns out that she really isn’t on anything at all, what would you have done in my position? I really love my workplace, and I’d hate to see it ruined to an alcoholic, or a maniac :/",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49673906}"
