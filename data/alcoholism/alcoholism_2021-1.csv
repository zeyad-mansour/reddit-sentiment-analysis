When I and my wife(girlfriend at that time) were moving out of my parent's home 15 years ago my mom was very distressed about it and she was giving me a lecture(first and last) about life. During this lecturing which turned into a mild argument, I implying said ""So many years went by and you still love dad, right?"" She paused for a second and said ""You can not call it love. It's a sense of the need to remain together"".

Fast forward 13 years. I notice constant arguing about little things that shouldn't matter. Awkward situations when dad only talks to me and my wife and my mom talks to me and my wife as well but not to my dad. My younger brother still lives with them and says they are always arguing about some stupidity. Dad starts to regularly drink. Not big amounts but it's constant be it friends, fishing, birthdays. He is 60 now, has no hobbies and has no desire to do anything at home except watch political trash in the country where we all were born and watch youtube about conspiracies. He doesn't want to spend time with my mother as he says it's boring. They don't travel together only in a group with other couples. He comes from work, expects food on the table and then off to his chair to watch YouTube. He doesn't spend time with grandchildren, doesn't help my mother with pretty much anything - even money. My mother has seasonal work and I've insisted on covering some medical bills and her business-related expenses because my dad has almost completely cut her off. If I bring any work-related situation up where I think he did wrong and I tell him, dad, he doesn't talk to me for weeks. They don't have any feelings for each other and they will never go their own ways. I don't get involved and the maximum I can do is hear my mom out when she complains about my father. He doesn't have many friends and I doubt he will find any. He is a very difficult person to have a constructive and healthy argument discussion with - it's either his way or no way. He is always grumpy about me extensively travelling with my wife and two kids and I have no clue why.

I'm trying to find a way to get him off the alcohol and find a hobby for him but it's a dead-end every time I think about it. Has anyone dealt with anything of this sort? Should I get involved or let the things naturally degrade?",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8278562}"
2021-01-30 17:38:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/l8xohl/trying_again_and_being_honest_with_myself/,Trying again - and being honest with myself.,"Hi everyone. I'll get right to the point.  


I know I have a drinking problem and that I've got to do something about it. Backstory:  


I'm 29 years old. Male. Been drinking frequently for about a decade now. I struggled with substance abuse in other contexts as well throughout my life. Alcohol took over for a lot of that years ago. I have been to a treatment center before and I have spent periods of my life not drinking (but not entirely sober, either). I have PTSD from a childhood accident that I wasn't diagnosed with until this previous year and alcohol is most frequently how I self-medicate to sleep.

That said: I just recently lost a job that I enjoy due to be intoxicated on the clock. I was hungover from the night before and went the hair of the dog route. My boss is a fair and far more understanding man than most. He offered me my job back provided I can finish a program. Being realistic, I don't see myself getting into a program right now - especially with COVID. However, I am looking at this whole thing as a blessing in disguise. It's a wake up call, for sure, and I want to try harder. At the very least, nobody got hurt.  


**So. Where am I going from here?**

I'm going to try to detox at home using an alcohol taper. Well, actually, I've already started. I've had two standard units of alcohol today and I didn't drink until I started to notice my shakes. As it stands, I only drink between 4-6 standard units of alcohol most days but I've been drinking that amount for an extended period of time. That's also not everyday. I can put away a handle, no problem. I just don't. I haven't enjoyed the intoxication from alcohol in quite a while so really, even until now, it's been just to self-medicate and stave off withdrawals. 

I'm also on prescription medication for anxiety and nerve damage (clonazepam and gabapentin). The fact that these two drugs are prescribed to me can be looked at a couple ways - blessings in the sense that they're both designed to prevent seizures. However, I don't want to substitute my drinking with either of those medications. I only have finite amounts of both and I also don't want to throw myself into withdrawal from them, either. I already feel like I could crawl out of my skin. I don't want to add convulsions and the inability to walk to it.

Game plan is to essentially only drink when my symptoms become problematic. Otherwise, going to spend a lot of my time playing bass guitar, looking for a new job, and writing.

My worst symptoms are the anxiety and shakes. Insomnia is just a constant with or without booze.

&#x200B;

**Why am I posting this?**

More of less just moral support and to hold myself accountable. If I can help someone else down the line, even better.  


I haven't told my roommates why I lost my job. They're already aware I have a drinking problem and they've been supportive in me quitting in the past but ultimately, it's up to me and not them. I have my rent covered for the next month and I have the means to make enough income to scoot by without a job if I need to. Ultimately, I just want to stop feeling this way. I already have enough mental problems without my addiction adding to it. I lost my dad a few years ago to liver disease. My step dad and me have come to blows over alcohol. It's enough.  


If I can't quit outright, I want more control. The only reason I got as far as I have, as an alcoholic, is the fact I come across as functional and friendly, but the cracks are starting to show. The fact I got this far without a DUI is amazing and I need to stop gambling.  


So-  


fuck it, AMA, if you have any advice I'd love to hear it, any stories are also welcome, really anything distracting. Each time I check back I'll update with symptoms and how I'm feeling overall. This might take me several days to get to a zero baseline cause I know the anxiety is going to be pretty severe. I just don't want to send myself over the moon. Nightmares are going to be extremely frequent. Thankfully, I already know what to expect personally. Not looking forward to it but looking forward to feeling better.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44509873}"

All of the people (atleast the ones he gets along with) are all also frequent drinkers. He considers it a part of who he is at this point - on the very few occasions that he hasn't been able to drink, he tends to be very quiet, and on edge, and struggles to sleep at night.

He works a day job, and spends most evenings just drinking himself to the point where he's slurring his words, and can pass out in his bed. 

He comes from a very conservative family, who have all tried to get him to not drink/smoke countless times, to deaf ears. My mom is a bit more open minded, and even she has probably asked him countless times to try to quit drinking, both through love and through aggression. It never ends well. 

He gets drunk, sometimes instigates her, and then they get into really ugly fights. I've grown up having many traumatic experiences of fights between them, and have tried to intervene whenever I can. He hits her, (and sometimes threatens to hit her). Over the past few years she threatens to hit him back, and has occasionally retaliated when it does happen.

They've threatened to divorce each other countless times, I've urged them to go ahead but somehow they never act on it, possibly because they feel worried about my younger brother (14M). After a few drinks, everyone generally tries to avoid having any sort of serious conversation with him, because it's really futile. 

It's been this way for as long as I can remember. I've been more vocal about things in the last few years, so he's decided that my mom is ""poisoning"" his sons and pushing them away from him. When I do voice how toxic this whole situation is, if he's sober he'll storm off, deflect onto my mom and make it about how my mom has antagonized him. If he's drunk, it has gotten ugly in the past, we almost got into a fist fight, which my mom had to stop.

In his head, he does everything he can for his family, and the only thing he does for himself is drink/smoke, which he feels he is entitled to. 

Additionally, he has struggled with his mental health over the past few years, because of financial troubles and unemployment. The alcoholism obviously doesn't help - he's even claimed to have suicidal thoughts and is generally very insecure about how his wife and sons don't love him.

At this point, I feel like we've tried everything. I don't know what to do anymore, I have a very important exam coming up and it's really distressing.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70823044}"

I never felt the need to and I never saw the charme of it. Around a week ago my first girlfriend for a few months left me after we knew each other since 2015. Im generally an extremely loney, introverted and unloveable person, so she basically changed my whole existence. Now Im completely destroyed and broken and tried out some wine and beer for the first time, and also some other stuff. While most of it was disgusting, wine wasnt too bad, and most of the stuff has the effect of numbing me and making me sleepy.

&#x200B;

My first night of drinking was terrible, I was completely insane and a fool, wrote several people silly stuff, insults and the sort and apologized for it the next morning. Then however I drank again after work and it just made me sleep pretty fast. I didnt dislike it so I started drinking wine and beer every single day for almost a week after work. It doesnt feel like an addiction so far, yet I dont want to be awake and concious without the 'dizzyness' and 'sleepiness' right now. When I wasnt at work I basically only slept or drank in my bed, and the disgustingness of it basically disappeared or doesnt bother me anymore.

&#x200B;

Im afraid this is turning into an addiction pretty fast, but I cant think of any other way to make me numb right now. a friend adviced me to dive myself into movies or videogames I like but it doesnt really work, they seem so bland and irrelevant right now. I think of my so almost all day and its unbearable not to be asleep. Some other friends just played the blame game for me for the drinking so I cut them off for now pretty fast. I dont know what to do, should I just go back to stuffing myself with sweets like I did the first days after my so being away too?

I have no one in my city, no friends or family that can be with me. im completely alone

Best years of my life having my own and being some how away from her however waves of guilt would happen because I was always with her even when she wasn’t around.her alcohol use increased after she resigned from her dream job in 2017 She attempted suicide January 2020 which was a mix of her depression and she had stopped  drinking for 5 days. In 2020 That is when all of our lives came crumbling down. We was dealing with her depression helping her stabilize, then we got covid etc.... in all of that I drank to cope with her, school being a mom wife virtual school. I started drinking almost two bottles of wine every other night but I was a happy drinker. I was more motivated to deal with everyone. I lost myself though I put everyone first except for me. I have a lot of resentment towards my mother for years a love hate relationship but I’m the only one who would ever die for her. Weird right ? 
I became the mother of the house and drinking was my escape. I’m happy we’re saving money but I’m miserable living with them. Now that I’m sober I’m less inclined to help I’m less inclined to be of service to them. If I cool I no longer serve them. Everyone is grown and can do for themselves. Now everyone jokes and says she needs wine maybe she’ll be nice again. That makes me angry cause I’m not mean sober I’m just more to myself. I’m more about me. How selfish are people ?  I wish I lived a lone. I wish it was just  me my daughter and husband again. I myself realize that I’m not easy to deal with when sober. I like my space and hate being checked up on. I don’t like anyone taking or acting like their taking care of me. And I hate being blamed for influencing anyone aka my mom to drink.

After 35 years of drinking, white-knuckling periods of sobriety, and then staring down the spiral of losing everything, I decided to go to rehab. Terrified at the thought of not drinking for a month. Terrified of feeling alone. All of it, I guess.

I had covid back in late Feb 2020, and it did permanent damage to my lungs, so I'm incredibly careful. Have been quarantining for a year now. I once went out for a run to try to ""stretch"" my lungs and ended up in an ambulance, so I'm also absolutely terrified of the havoc a second bout could wreak.

My first mistake: I live on the east coast of the US, and the rehab I chose is on the west coast. Their holistic approach appealed to me like none of the others I'd spend days researching, and it also looked beautiful, reviews were stellar, and all of other.

So I double-masked up and headed off. They picked me up from the airport, and dropped me off. A quick swab up to the brain (you probably all know how that feels), and I started. Have never been more hopeful and happy. The sessions are incredible; the staff the ultimate in professionalism and care. This was the absolute right place to be. After just one day I knew my sober future would begin here.

Day 2 started with meditation and another group session. I already felt so welcome it was like being amongst friends. And there were only four clients present in the house we were in. (More of a mansion, but that's not really the point of this.) Then my name was called from the side. I walked over and learned I'd tested positive. Escorted to my room where tears ensued. My journey, literally to my much needed promised land, was coming to a halt.

Being in what was likely the final stage of detox, I wasn't able to move into one of the sanctioned San Diego quarantine facilities. Bureaucracy decided that because my fingers still had a little shake to them, even though my sweats and BP were down to normal, I was too much of a risk.

I obviously also couldn't get on a plane, a train, or a bus to try to get home, so I'd have to make my own quarantine.

Found a little hotel in downtown SD, picked up a few supplies, and here I shall sequester for 10 days, and pray to God that when I do need to go out to get supplies, I don't infect someone else, despite all the precautions I shall take.

I doubt my sobriety will last, but I am going back to rehab to finish treatment once this is over.

But do consider this for a moment: instead of allowing someone into the no doubt much safer quarantine facilities because there might be a medical risk to them from the last stage of detox (never mind the medical risk EVERYONE with Covid has anyway due to dying from the virus), they essentially threw me out on the street where I could, if I were irresponsible, infect countless people putting hundreds at risk of their own death.

And who knows which strain I have. I don't. All I know is that I'm staying in this room because I'm going to be a heck of a lot more responsible and sensible than the government.

Thank you for reading.

Stay safe everyone, and take your own precautions every time you go out because who knows how many others are in a similar predicament as my own, and perhaps didn't have the resources to afford a hotel for 10 days.

Love to you all!

When I used to think of an alcoholic I thought of the stereotypical, always drunk, falling everywhere everyday, which is not my mother’s case at all. Basically my mother drinks every single day, but only after work. Probably consumes about 2 bottles of wine a night. Let me just point out she gets up everyday at 5am and works 2 jobs and seems completely normal at any other time. 

Side note: my dad was an alcoholic before my mother and he was in AA when he met her. He enables the shit out of her drinking always make sure her glass is full even if she can’t stand up. 

Growing up I never really questioned anything, until my teen years when my friends would come over and my mom would be slurring her words and just acting drunk before passing out on the couch at 9pm. It was so embarrassing I stopped having friends over. Another aspect that made me start realizing her drinking might not be “normal” is when I’d open up to her about something or need to talk to her and she wouldn’t remember our conversations the next morning. 

Fast forward to adulthood, and I am horrible in relationships. I realized how much emotional support and learning I lacked from my mother my entire life, I never felt like I could go to her for anything she deflects dealing  with emotion in any way she can (often by literally ignoring what I’m saying, or pretending she didn’t hear me). I have self esteem and self identity issues and at my lowest I literally felt like I had no worth. (Getting better thx 4 therapy)

Right now I’m struggling with severe resentment to her and my father for enabling her. I also had to move back home this year because of a break up with a long term boyfriend. My mental state is fragile right now, and hearing her drunken slurs every. Single. Night. Is just reminding me that I do not have anyone to turn to during this hard time in my life. 

I feel so lonely some nights, I was so close with my exs family and his mother was the best mother figured i e ever had in my life and she treated me as I was her daughter, so it’s hard to go from having a huge support system to no one. Throw in a global pandemic too just for the cherry on top of this last year.

During the period, we had a lot of arguments about his drinking issues. He often drinks 6 cans or bottles of beer within 2 hours per night. Sometimes we eat outside, he buys two drinks and then on the way home, he can still buy several cans too for the night. He is very talkative after drinking, but the next day, he will not remember any plan he made the previous drinking night. He also gets easily frustrated by small things. I cannot relate to him because I don't see those small things so troublesome. The good thing is he doesn’t get aggressive against me after drinking, but other people's behaviours can irritate him. If he drinks alone outside without me, he can hardly move his butt, because he will only get back after midnight (before covid, the time when pubs are all closed). One time he sneaked out to drink with his “friends” after I fell asleep. After he came back, he got calls from strange girls who were not his friends before that night. And then he begged my forgiveness and promised to quit. No need to say, the promise is broken. Every time I ask him why he needs to drink, his answer is “just to relax.” For me, sitting on the couch and watching Netflix is relaxing enough. I never drink (seriously never, even in social events) and cannot understand why someone needs to drink or marijuana to relax—nobody in my family drinks. I’m a devoiced woman with two kids (fortunately my kids don't have to live with us). My ex-husband doesn’t drink either. So actually, nobody close to me in my life drinks before I knew him. At the beginning of dating, I didn’t realize his drinking habit is so stubborn, but now I feel he probably couldn’t quit by himself at all. He also smokes weed, and the reason is to relax or replace the drink because I required him to stop drinking. We broke up and separated twice for his drinking. The last time he promised to quit and complained about his shitty living environment and safety during the covid. I gave him a chance again. But after he moved back near Christmas, he began to drink again. Once he began to drink, he couldn’t stop, and it was a continuous one week’s drinking at least 6 bottles of beer every day. Most of the day, he is alone at home, so I don’t know how many he has actually drunk.

What I saw is he would also hide some other harder drinks, too, maybe being afraid of me finding out. Now it seems he will drink anyway. He doesn’t care about honouring his words or being a man who keeps his words. He worked in hospitality and now stays at home getting EI. He has credit card debt and a student loan. Although he didn’t earn much, he still spent a lot eating outside to get a drink before covid. Now he doesn’t go out to eat anymore but still gets drinks and drinks alone. When he drinks, he often goes to the washroom, quickly feels cold, and sometimes has a headache afterward; he also gains weight easily because of drinking, but he does not care about his health. If we happen to have some arguments about anything, what I’m sure is that after I leave home, he will go to buy some beers; and then after I come back, he will smoke some weeds and begin to appear “happy” and make some friendly gestures or a plan that he will not drink for one week or something. Now all of his words are not trustworthy to me anymore. Although he is not a bad person, I cannot trust him to be responsible, loyal, or competent. Life seems so hard for him that minimal work can make him so anxious and irritated. He refuses to move out, although before he moved in, he promised that he would if he drank again. Now I just totally lost interest in interacting with him because I feel everything from him is only acting to buy some time for a “comfortable” life. He doesn’t respect my lifestyle and personality. Maybe he will never understand how I lost my respect for him little by little.",1,{'covid': 3},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56484383}"

On my heaviest days I can finish almost a 1/5 of hard liquor, a case of beers or a bottle and a half of wine.

I was the type of drunk who needed to be inebriated to make friends and tackle my day with enthusiasm. I didn’t like my dependency on alcohol and thought that without it, I could eventually be outgoing and happy while sober. Fast forward almost three months and I’ve lost contact with friends, have an extremely low libido (I can tell my gf notices it and it sucks for her but she’s too nice to say anything) And I just in general feel too much social anxiety to leave my apartment or even text/call people. Sober me is much happier staying in and playing video games but it’s ruining my relationships and friendships, the loneliness is awful. 

I’ve been prescribed several anxiety meds and they help a little, but nothing has nearly the same affect as alcohol.

I feel like the “normal” me is just naturally a nervous agoraphobic wreck, because that’s what I was like before I started drinking at 19. Now, to my surprise, stopping drinking just reverted me back to the teenage version of me who had 0 friends and who couldn’t get a gf until I started drinking. (Basically, back to the version of me who was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder) Every great friendship and relationship I’ve ever had only began and survived through my liquid courage. 

Keep in mind, I abused tf out of alcohol and needed to drink everyday...but I was not an angry drunk, and don’t have situations where drunk me becomes a problem or burden on others, my gf actually says it makes me more fun.

Can’t believe I made it and I can’t believe how good I feel.  I was so terrified of detox.  As a fifth a night guy on the weeknights and a half gallon a day on the weekends, never thought I’d make it thru.  I beg anyone that is considering going cold turkey, go see your doctor!!  The Librium is a miracle drug.  With that heavy of a drinking schedule I should have been seizing in the floor by day two.  Nope!  The only symptom, and I do mean only was the night sweats.  But here is the thing, the first 4 nights I slept like a baby!!  Now, the meds are outta my system now so the insomnia is creeping in which causes me major anxiety because my job is very physical and cannot be done in no sleep.  I’m drinking a crap load of camomile tea and taking unisom till I can see the doc again later this week.  He said he’d give me something to help with sleep and something for anxiety long term.   This weekend, I stayed up playing board games with my two little girls three straight nights.  Instead of the usual “not tonight honey, daddy doesn’t feel good.”  I had such an amazing time.  I’ve missed two years of them growing up right in front of me.  The guilt I feel as a single parent for that will be something I take to my grave.  Also, the app I’m using to track my progress told me today that in one week I saved 198 dollars.  I became really ashamed of that.   So ashamed.  800 bucks a month on cheap ass bourbon.  That’s a mortgage payment or a better life for my kids!!!  I can’t believe I let it get that bad.  The best part about all this is....I’ve not had one single craving, I’m sure they will come, but I want nothing to do with the poison anymore!

At the start of the first pandemic lockdown in March, I decided to not drink for a week and realised it had been the first time I had gone a week without drinking since 17 (23 now). I had headaches, dizziness and a host of other withdrawal symptoms. I realised I had drank 6 days a week since then, with my day off being before a match/game once a week (I play a sport at a very high level, professional, including many international representatives hence I won't specify). This always lead me to believe I was healthy and fine.

Since this realisation, I've only drank with people and not alone (when possible), however, have recently relapsed and been drinking alone quite a bit.

I enjoy drinking, partying, and going to the pub with mates and would like to continue, but I would like to do so without addiction being a factor, for the future sake of relationships and children, etc.

I had work tomorrow so I really shouldn’t have had anything to drink, but I convinced myself I could handle it and I would be fine for work the next morning. And of course once my buzz set in I decided I should keep drinking to keep my buzz going. So I wake up the next morning already 20 minutes late for work and drunk. I knew I was sobering up so l thought it would be a good idea to drive to work and try to get through my shift. Rather than call in and take a day off because I made a shit poor decision, I decided to make another shit poor decision and drunk drive to the place I (used to) work. 

By the grace of god I made it to work safely. My coworkers never even caught me drunk. I fell asleep, woke up panicking that I just fucking fell asleep at work, and asked for the day off. Fast forward to today, turns out I was caught sleeping by my employer last week and I was terminated today. I have no job during a pandemic where shit loads of people aren’t able to find work and all because I decided to fucking day drink on a work day. Like a fucking idiot. And what’s worse is I could’ve genuinely hurt someone while driving 

Maybe this isn’t the right place for this post. I don’t know if I’m an alcoholic but when I think back to the other times I’ve overdone it, times when I’ve blacked out and woken up in a hospital, I realize there’s definitely a problem and I don’t want a relationship with booze anymore. This wasn’t worth it and the poor decisions I made for drinking or because I was drinking are so unlike me. I’ve let myself and my family down and I will never touch another drop of this shit again.

It's driving me nuts, particularly with a strong background in Nietzsche when I studied philosophy. Not only is it driving me nuts, it's making me feel very low about myself and I'm beginning to feel like my accomplishments are not accomplishments... I'm feeling like I'm being gaslit but at the same time I tell myself ""it's you're ego and you're being too proud to fully surrender and its a defect of your own self that you feel this way"" and so I'm just in this cyclical thought process... and perhaps it's both me and also the ideals of AA. I'm just... crying too much over AA that I don't think it's productive for my sobriety.

Last week I decided I would just start picking things that worked best for my sobriety from AA, SMART, and recovery groups... but yesterday on an AA zoom meeting that all crumbled and I just... I don't know where these feelings are coming from and again... I just hate myself so much thinking that maybe these feelings are all because of my own defects.

I'm in a healing part of my life and I've really been working on building self esteem (by doing esteemable things) but also accepting praise from others (because I have little to no self-value), being happy and proud of my successes and strides to be a better person, so on and so forth... and then thoughts like these seem to really challenge that progress.

So! Let me start by saying being sober is hard.. Really is some days.. But I noticed something today.. I noticed my memory serves me correctly and I’m able to function while doing work online. 

So this is what I’m trying to get at. 

When I’m drunk, I usually hang around all kinds of people, not a fucking care in the world! Right? Right. So that said, I started noticing some of the people I’m around and the way they treat me every. single. day. 

A lot of them insult me in a way that’s not like a joke. I’ve been so drunk in the past that I’ve failed to notice the attack on my character presented before me. It’s my fault.. but now that I’m sober that’s not gonna fly.

This girl I know just insults me day and night. I thought I liked her but she’s just stupid and puts me down so I can feel like her or go down to her level.. 

She calls me “dumbass” and I barely know her like that. Like come on, friends its ok to talk shit, we all do it. But we barely met. Even my close friends got more respect for me than that... Usually I just laugh and say “you’re mean” or “haha wow where is this anger coming from” because I’m a nice guy, I usually don’t fight people when they insult me. She said my face looks stupid. We’re not fucking kids, we’re adults wtf is wrong with her. 

I snapped today. I was setting up my computer and helping some friends out today with errands.. and. Again.. she said I’m a dumbass right out the gate, even told me to drop out of college.. Then I fucking snapped

I said “Are you fucking seriously gonna keep insulting me? You know what? FUCK THIS IM OUT” and fucking left her looking stupid at Target. 

Moral of the story.. don’t take any form of abuse from anyone. Make room for better things by cutting out toxic things from your life. They exist. Be aware.

This is my first post here! I am not completely at ease with English so forgive me for the grammar errors.

I am 20yo. Since I was a kid, I remember my dad used to have frequent drunkenness. He wouldn't get drunk every day. He would often get drunk, ""rest"" for 2-3 days and then get drunk again.

I have clearly vivid memories of seeing my father drunk hitting my mom, it only happened once (that I can remember). One time he grabbed my older brother by his neck. Everytime he got drunk he becomes very agressive, he would often infuriate himself without an apparent reason. He disrespected me, my brother, my mother.

Physical threats were also guaranteed when he got drunk, emotional abuse, living in my house when my father is drunk is close to impossible.

One of the worst things he did to me, and this was 1 year ago, when I was 19y, one day he got so drunk that he began to yell at me outside of my home. I live in a neighbourhood, a small one, altough it was at night, I'm sure the shouts he made everyone could listen. He threatened me, insulted me, with 0 regards about how I felt.

Altough my father doesn't drink everyday, I am not sure if he is an alcoholic. During this lockdown, since very bar is closed, he doesn't get drunk (finally). But when he did, we has overly aggressive and I feel that I have scars inside me because of that.

Can anyone post some links/books/articles/whatever about how can I get along with the scars I have ? I feel that my personality was heavily impacted by how he used his drink, altough he isn't an alcoholic, he knew that his drunk state was a nightmare in my house, but he couldn't say to himself: I will drink one last beer, and then go home. No, we keeps drinking, and drinking and only stops when he isn't allowed to drink more...",5,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.83058}"

Not going to have any noticeable buzz and am going grocery shopping and running errands with family in a little bit.  (Wife driving just in case)   No biggie right?     

Well I have two more beers (same 16oz heavy hitters)  in fridge that are going down when the football games come on later.   Prolly have a little buzz at way end of night but maybe not.  I mean it's only the equivalent of 6 Budweiser's stretched over an entire day.  190lb male for reference.  

Can't remember last time I was legit drunk.  But also can't remember many days where I didn't drink at least a couple beers.   I mean I usually grab an interesting 16oz as I leave work and drink it on the last 15 minutes of my drive.  (Plz don't focus on this as bars should be straight up illegal if that's an issue)

I drink because it tastes awesome, no liquor, finding a taste for wine lately though.    I mean deep down I do know that having the equivalent of a six pack and half bottle of wine a couple times a week is too much. 

Dunno do I have a problem?  Probably yeah because I'm even typing this up.   I mean I just quit weed and visit r/leaves regularly.   Maybe it's time to give up beer and just stick to wine with dinner.   But then I know I'll want wine every night and a good craft beer is amazing tasting so I'm punishing myself when I don't have to be?  

I love my life but there's 5% that wants to frank reynolds foaming at the mouth day drink.

I don’t remember much of it cause she hid it well and I was young, but I now know she almost died from drinking and went to rehab twice. I do remember finding a pint under her clothes pile once when we thought she was sober but I didn’t say anything. My dad found out that night and they had a fight.

He usually isn’t violent, but sometimes he gets in moods and I just don’t like being around him when he’s drunk anymore. It makes me sad. Even when he’s sober we barely talk, I don’t have a relationship with him anymore. I’m scared for his health. He won’t get help.

First, we drink a lot, by most measures. She drinks about a half to a full bottle of vodka every day and about a bottle of white wine and some red wine. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But she drinks every waking hour, every day. She doesn't work, so that makes it feasible. 

I drink a lot as well, usually less than her, but every day as well. Whiskey and wine typically. I usually don't drink until the evening, but typically a half bottle of whiskey and perhaps a bottle of red wine. 

I haven't worked much for the last 10 months, living at home all the time, which has contributed to increased drinking for me. She seems to be about the same drinking-wise, but when I worked a 9-5 I didn't see her constant drinking, so it wasn't as much of an issue. 

We get along great pretty often, but usually argue nastily on a daily basis, particularly as the drink takes effect. (I don't want to appear biased, but I think it typically comes from her end) 

We have been married for almost 10 years, and this has certainly turned into a co-dependent situation. (fyi, no kids, thank goodness) I buy the booze; she drinks, I drink.

We have discussed / argued about divorce on several occasions. I have talked to an attorney. She has said she is all about divorce if I want it. But ... it is difficult to pull the plug on our life together, the home that we have curated together over years, all the good times, which still exist, the comfort, the memories, the love. 

I just don't think either of us can overcome the drinking issue together, which seems to be the main source of our problems. She certainly doesn't want to, but I do. She will never stop drinking and was a died in the wool alcoholic when I met her. I've only become a heavy drinker over the years with her.

So, my question is, can I, in good conscience, file for divorce and separate in order to save my own life and sanity, or am I obligated to stay with her and try to improve myself and continue to support her addiction? I fear that I / we are heading into a downward spiral that is becoming increasingly difficult to control and unhealthy for both of us.

Just finished detox and treatment...

What a scary and dark place I was in, trying to kick it on my own. Spent a few days unsure of what was happening. Absolutely no desire to drink anymore (which I’m thankful for) and just quit. I’ve been drinking through most of my 20’s, almost nightly. Being 28 now, I made the decision to quit. My mother committed suicide in June of 2020. That being the most significant, it was unfortunately not the only horrible thing to happen within the year. I drank myself numb almost every night, which was an increase from my usual intake. For some reason I was able to quit cold turkey in November. Had about a month down when I thought that having a drink again, without the excess consumption, was something I could control. It wasn’t. So when I went to go cold turkey again earlier this month, things were completely different. I couldn’t sleep more than an hour or so, and when I did, I’d wake up in a sleep paralysis. Waves of dread and anxiety came frequently. Shaking and at times feeling very cold in a warm room also happened. Finally I started checking my BP. Worried that I might have Covid I frequently checked my temp as well. This only increased the my seemingly endless anxiety spells. After a couple days I was beginning to also hear things that weren’t there on top of all of the other symptoms. A close family member made me aware that I’m probably going through alcohol withdrawal. That also matched up with the paramedics who came. Problem was they didn’t recommend for me to see treatment as my BP subsided again before they arrived. 

On the third morning I made the decision to find a detox facility and seek help. I wasn’t thinking of hurting myself yet but I knew for an absolute fact I wasn’t going to spend another night in this new weird insanity I felt I was slipping into. Ended up spending two and a half weeks in treatment. (It was a shortened program, so yes I completed it) I still had quite a few sporadic sleepless nights, but ultimately felt safe being somewhere that specialized. 

We had about 6 group sessions a day, as well as a daily session with our assigned therapist. I quickly realized that this wasn’t just a problem with alcoholism. I had a thinking problem. A problem with excessive behavior of many things. For my entire adult life I resorted to alcohol/drugs/sex/eating/procrastination... the list goes on. If it allowed me to control my emotions and snuff my feelings, stress, etc. I did it ALOT. 

I’m very confident I won’t be drinking anytime soon. The goal is forever, but I’m trying to not to freak out over the idea of completely quitting. We attended a few NA sessions which were also eye-opening. 

Sunday will be my third week sober. I still am struggling with the daily anxiety episodes but thankfully the elevated health concerns seem to be over for now. Medication has been prescribed for my BP and I am now regularly watching my diet and going to the gym. Hoping to use this group as a place to talk and log my personal experiences as they happen.

The past 3 years I’ve been drinking way too much, about 5 months ago I went 3 days without drinking and that was the longest i had gone in 3 years. For the past 3 years it’s been 3-6 seltzers or beers AND 3-6 nips each night during the week depending on the night. On the weekends sometimes over half a 750 of tequila and 6-7 seltzers in a day, sometimes more (certain days have been a whole bottle of tequila between me an my gf, and a 12 pack of seltzers or beers. I ONLY drink Silver Tequila either mixed w water, hard seltzer or straight, hard seltzers, and sometimes beer, I don’t drink ANYTHING sugary (yes I know tequila has sugar but it’s very minimal). While drinking these amounts i never was too fucked up, I have pretty high tolerance for alcohol. To make a long story a little shorter. I’ve abused my body with alcohol and shitty food for years now.  During the 3 years of all that boozing I was also out of work for a good portion of it due to an injury and wasn’t exercising. I now have a great job, make really good money, and now that I’m busy and not worried about money it’s so much easier to stop drinking. About a month ago I stopped drinking during the week completely, not only that, but I don’t drink on Friday nights, only some saturdays, and if I do it’s just a couple seltzers (I still drink Sunday’s, but not nearly as much). I’ve also eat almost completely clean now. For the past month I’ve felt extremely fatigued and tired constantly... I’ve also felt kinda dizzy (like my equilibrium is off), and sometimes find myself confused and not able to think straight (I constantly walk into a room and it takes me about 10 seconds to remember what I went in there for). All this makes me nervous, does any of this sound normal after cutting down heavy alcohol consumption everyday for years to about 5% of what I was drinking before? I’m starting to freak myself out and thinking I need to be tested for things like Diabetes, Low T, MS, Cancer etc. Or is my body just in shock and resetting?Thankyou in advance 🙌🏽",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4300136}"

I know this may come off as a stupid question since the obvious answer is YES. My problem is that I am dependent on alcohol for sleeping. I drink roughly 1.8 L of 8% malt liquor (Olde English) every single day when I get home from work in order to fall asleep. So clearly I am an abuser and dependent on alcohol. 

However, it seems a lot of people here drink around the clock, have crazy cravings, etc. 

During the day, I feel no craving for it, my withdrawal symptoms are very mild (shakes, sometimes sweating, and grogginess). 
I never experience hangovers or headaches. I work in a lab 50-60hours a week and am a high functioning alcohol user. 

Even after work, I don’t crave for it, but I pick up the bottle knowing that if I don’t drink tonight, I won’t be able to sleep and wake up for work. 

In the past, every time I have tried to sleep without being drunk, I would almost fall into a seizure it feels like. It’s so scary that I basically lay there just resting until morning comes because entering into those dream tremors is too terrifying for me to sleep. 

I’ve recently gotten a DUI and now with a criminal record, I want to quit. Last night I drank like usual and went to sleep. I woke up around 4 am in the morning and when I tried to go back to sleep, I had the most intense dream tremor/seizure I’ve ever experienced. Violent shaking and heavy breathing, heart pounding and me heavy breathing until I woke myself up to escape it.

Wouldn't simply listening  and saying nothing be better and carry more weight than this comical failed attempt at pretending to possess character and can be witty for reasons only a weak-minded person believes by needing to satisfy an endless need for handling the endless need of security, false or not ;  apparently they're also unable to see themselves doing a rather great disservice to the peers that can sometimes process complex situations that might actually require if available, same competent  methods of higher thinkers, not ones that pretend to listen by taking time to project a false notion they're actively listening in a place that contains many more meaningful things for it to flourish in contrast to this much less than simpler and certainly pointless environment the perps undoubtedly go back to lurking in after they feel it's safe to slither back into the shadows of their black hole, of what clearly does not provide enough darkness to cover-up all of their infectious deceit and lies.

2021-01-22 09:08:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/l2ofyi/is_this_alcoholism/,Is this alcoholism?,"Hello,

I am very confused about my partner's drinking - my initial opinion was that she has a major drinking problem, but other factors since I've confronted her about this have really cast some doubt and I'm not sure what to think or how to proceed.

On one hand, she has always been a drinker and in the 3 years since her mother's death it had escalated to at *least* a bottle of wine each night, more on any kind of occasion or weekend.  She would be noticeably drunk at family gatherings or social functions, and would not acknowledge that it was any kind of serious problem and if it was, she can handle it herself.  Along with this came some very large scale infidelity with many partners over a long period of time in situations that I would have considered to be extremely out of character.  About 6 months ago, I discovered her cheating and as a condition for reconciliation I had told her she needs to get her drinking under control.  In the time since then she had not made much progress.

This all seems like a shoe-in for a major drinking problem to say the least, and about 7 weeks ago I had confronted her again about not being able to control her drinking and that she needs addiction counselling.  Since then she has simply stopped drinking entirely and does not appear to be having any trouble with it.  She continues to deny that she has a drinking problem and only went to the counsellor because I forced her to, I also question how forthcoming she is when talking with the counsellor.  I am very confused at this point, since this super heavy drinker just switched it off and, as far as I know, has not been back.  I want her to continue taking this seriously, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just overreacting because I'm associating her being a drinker with her being a cheater.

2021-01-22 06:14:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/l2ln8c/theres_no_manual_on_providing_the_proper_way/,"There's no manual on providing the proper way AND/OR improper way or methods of joining, learning, and advancing through the AA program so by then being considered a product of success at recovery (which let's say here that was only possible through relying on the structured AA program as a map.)","""Yeah, no shit sherlock!"" I'm sure is a common attitude in response to such an obvious statement I put as the title, but I challenge you to really think critically about something that may have everything not to do with what I'm supposed to know or even seek advice on.... but I'd say it probably can be broken down and argued from several different angles that probably still won't give a definite answer to what my dilemna of the simple quesiton in working this program the way it's intended.  Or AKA what is Proper VS Improper.  The fact that each person can usually only develop and use their personalized ""box of tools"" that consist of concepts/ideas/suggestions/advice/-isms that made sense for whatever reason to them are the tools they will be expected to use in order to ensure a simpler, and more probable and permanent transition to their recovery from alcohol addiction; which hence briefly outlines the overall mission of AA membership.

 so an example of one idea for a tool came to me as a result of understanding this concept which is one of the many first principles taught in probably every treatment center that I know of. So what I learned is that because I would eventually come to know the Big Book is a very important part to a lot of people's recoveries.  Some more than others, but its commonly know that it should be read, someone offered the suggestion of getting comfortable with the idea you'll practically read it enough you will memorize it (not even sure if this person was facetious in suggesting this but a few hundred pages doesn't sound like a walk in the park) but since it is after all, the Holy Grail of the AA program and the concepts in this book (dated or not)  are not to be taken with any ounce of question or objections to its validity, you find yourself simply tailoring the given information in such a way, you can only hope for the best understanding of its many concepts of which are most times only unique and even more times only understood by a person that if they were so much as to fullfill any general set of criteria to then be determined and classified as ""true alcoholic"", these concepts should make enough sense that your own set of relatable ideas are unique and somehow define a lot of general ideas that you believe to fit your syptoms of possibly exhibiting alcoholism to a T!  (There's much emphasis here in the way every alcoholics stories are practically a lot of alike for reasons I guess only a person would be able to fully understand only by having been actively involved in alcohol use that is serious enough to be checked out) 

I've also heard the expression, if you are able to advance and go through the material at a reasonable pace, you will no longer be reading this so called BigBook, but rather start to believe the book to be reading you. Sounds great, what do you lose if you give it a shot?  That's easier said than done without any other supporting material that may offer help to digest what I wasn't even sure I'd be a believer in anyways;  Or that it's not reasonable to put so much faith in the idea that it would be impossible to achieve sobriety in any other ways than those offered in the book, which is a common principle that usually is suggested by the members themselves that are actively working their program by means of these steps, also ones that are never ending, so the ideas and content that may be created by a person may be as long and old as the time they sat down to do the first step.  I guess that in itself is a hard thing to stomach and just makes for another reason why this plan may not even work.  So, the type of thinking that only comes natural to someone not understanding that above all else, it will offer you the secret or answer to a solution to a problem that is widely misunderstood both by alcoholics and non I feel like. So what is the way of sucking it up and tackling a bunch of new ideas that will take work and probably time to conquer? 

Credibility of almost all  of the ideas that stuck out to me meanwhile trying to find arguments against them was simply put most times chalked up a failure. It's not so much that I consider it easier to throw the standard research procedures I learned to use all through my years of schooling out the window that involve fact checking and standardized measures to classify information's validity, was not in fact easier, but I concluded it's the only way to deem the information given in the book convincing enough that it really isn't worth the scrutiny because of the nature of concepts that are used in explaining or understanding alcoholism and there nature could be argued are metaphorical and metaphors are good learning tools in my opinion.  The discretion in taking the information in a metaphorical sense rather than to be taken literally; This is something I found challenging in devising a plan in covering all information to have a general, yet satisfactory understanding of AA fellowship and it's programs offerings.  Still not understanding or have an idea on how to break down the book from the few times I skimmed through it and finally read it but not sure how much of the material i could recall. 

So what's the point I'm trying to make?  I'm not seeing many reassurances that how I'm taking in a pretty decent sized set of information that esentially contains another man's ideas and sometimes foreign concepts that took time and practice for the true winners of the challenge the BigBook seems to pose to everyone who has been to a treatment center.  Everyone gets one and a new, fresh, book to me was a reminder that I cant NOT put the work in. Every time, without fail, the interest I had in maintaining had lost its luster and I'd wander how the hell it happened.  

So back to beginning the reading and material.To be frank, I think it's safe to say there's no real way of navigating the book which in keeping things simple, would be suffice to begin at the first pages of Bill's story and to ensure you're not missing just do it in normal book fashion.  I think a lot of the initial reading was hard to get through but just like that movie your friend said had actually turned out to be really good and you may have to give it another shot because of something we're probably all to familiar with is not giving it a chance.   BUT nobody said the books meant to entertain so I guess I don't quite remember a lot of the details but I know it skips around to talk about general things such as family up to pretty peticular details so I guess the book was really thought out much by anyone else besides the author so that is definately something to consider.  Also take and stop before the second half of the book which contains short stories of some of the many success stories.  To stay interested, the short stories in the back are a good alternative if the main material is becoming drab.  

The pace a person would be expected to finish all the material in the book since the best way is up for anyone's debate. So as long as you make a conscious effort in routinely cracking open the Big Book, and by which fulfills the need to work towards being read up on the BigBook.  This I think is the most important step in officially becoming an active and productive AA member.  

Because the only way that I eventually relied on to take the book in chunks seemed easier, but usually was done pretty aimlessly, and sometimes too sporadically enough it let an opening for issues like learning sets of concepts that should be read in chronological order.  

So simply just being convinced that I'd finally agreed to that there was enough interest in giving the BigBook the respect that it so clearly had gotten in the eyes of these more experienced AA members I'd be looking up to.  that it's now an investment I'm willing to put the time and effort into which required a pretty open mind to give enough that could probably either be painful to try and understand or maybe really is the crystal ball for a person seeking pretty significant life changes.

For those that have read this far but have little or no knowledge of the AA program, this book was written by Dr. Bill and possibly another guy if I remember right named Bob. I hadn't given much more thought on how they even researched the vast amount of information offered as reasonable sound advice from Dr. Bill himself who had finally found out a way to become sober and then went on to write a set of 12 steps that are to be worked on, in order, and even indefinately, as there is no finish or graduation from the program as it is intended to be continually worked through steps 1-12 and then over again, until death. (Made much more sense about 'until death' after being able to understand the simple ideology of once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.  Having No known cures for true alcoholics goes back to a pretty evident lack of understanding especially when considering how far we have gotten in today's standard medicine principles, I think alcoholism had only maybe been looked at differently only until recent when considering its entire timespan to be used by humans even in very ancient civilations that didnt seem very far along in civilized ways of living and alcohol definately has its large and wide acceptance in most parts of the world.  The only ones left are due to religious reasons so because of all of this, the alcohol is not going anywhere anytime soon and probably will forever be used and unfortunately abused by sometimes helpless people; ones like myself that became creative but unsuccessful nevertheless in controlling my alcohol use. 

Back to Bill, he himself and not sure however many other people that piecemealed this organization into a tried and tested product that did withstood also withstand the ultimate test of time.  I can only be honest in saying that some of the material in the Big Book is written in context of using language that contains slang dating back almost a hundred years so that added just a bit more confusion in my dilemna with the vast amount of gray area that could vary in size from individual to individual. (I'm trying my best but I would have an endless list of things that I can;t seem to want to understand or end up and just pretend its just an unwritten law and it's the way Bill put it. So his way is never going to be the wrong way, just a different way,.  


A bit off topic, and it was always a strange concept to me personally, but when hearing someone telling another person as a matter of factly that what alcoholism really is and that this is actually not just a grossly repulsive behavior that people cared not to find reasons to understand or ultimately couldn't because it really isn't that significant to them but is still at the same time for some reason attractive enough to hold other ""different"" people merciless to it's addictive qualities, but it's actually a disease.  I can't do much explaining on that last one; if you havent been properly educated in trying to understand this is was considered Science's breakthrough by its reclassification of Alcoholism as something that may after all find it's place in a list of treatable diseases because of forward-thinking people of the medical world found enough criteria that it's definately not something we are not incapable of gaining further understanding of, and by nature, is a detrimental health concern for people that are now looked at is the premise that ""alcoholics"" are actually cursed with something like cancer that is just rather unfortunate and out of the hands of anyone's true solution like a cure or advanced treatment that takes it off the list of considerable reasons for most of the populations deaths. 

So not sure how much all of this information  would effect someones success in sobriety, but I do know there's got to be something in this book everyone can take with them.   So I see it as the more eductated you are, maybe the more you see your ability in finding that set of tools that gets you further than you believed possible in recovery.  


One other thing, and I wanted to touch on the stigma AA might have from outsiders.  Not that it's really effecting the programg itself, I'm still interested when thinkikng about the very little I knew about the program and so it almost does now make sense that I may have thought I accidentally joined something close to what a person may think of as being cultish in the idea that there sometimes seems like brainwashing of its newer members especially, which really is the only method I can think of to ensure every member has been given the same opportunity along with the set of ideas that sometimes can be questioned if a person chooses to and exercises their natural right to do so.  I ultimately broke myself to understand that this is much more unnecccessary effort and doesn't make much sense not including something of what seems is more like a pieces that won't fit anywhere else but to complete a more complex, yet full set of puzzle pieces that will eventually be all inclusive and available for tips on how to assemble that puzzle piece by piece in the BigBook, I guess to put it another way,the idea is more about adopting new ideas and behaviors to allow for the correction of the older faulty ones

Any longer of having the ability in the learning environment in AA to say, ""Hmmm, I'm going to have to call a possible case of bullshit on that!"" is now void and goes against your allegiance to commit to the program in its entirety. 


                                   ***

So what I vaguely tried describing is my best way to illustrate what AA membership actually involves.  Must say it took me a very long time to start accepting the inevitable compliance to some of the redundancy involved in reading, for example, there are a few set of rules and mission statements so these articles of the program are read before every meeting and honestly I've never payed much attention to understanding every rule since its more of like ritual and is a part of AA that becomes familiar and just another reason I guess that comes along with belonging in something, the ritual part that is. 

 Uncertain and not even really sure if all of it will make sense to a person that isn't somewhat at least familiar with enough knowledge and experience of AA to follow along.  Is it too late in the article to make mention I have about 10 years experience of attending AA in and out of the multiple treatments I've attended? Both inpatient/outpatient, roughly three times each to be exact, and they all used AA as really the only suggested way of having the best crack at having a fighting chance in hell understanding the sickness enough to be convinced that it's at least worth trying to fight like its with your lI'm ultimately aspiring to be andife, it literally is for me.  I know AA at its entirey has gotten to be a pretty large gathering that is worldwide and each year only brings more believers of the AA program. Hopefully this provided enough information so that a person could at least decide if its for them.  One last piece of noteworthy mention is that my decision to become involved in AA did not come very quickly,  It was actually a very slow process that I didn't ever consider on a serious level.  It wasnt 3 treatments later that I probably was 100% convinced I am probably going to need the structure of AA if I am going after a sober life. 

If I had failed to mention anything of importance that could be necessary to someone not familiar could you at least mention in reply.  Please let me know since I can edit this and it could be really beneficial to the people unaware of any potential help they might gain if joining AA was something they were considering.  Also of my personal hangups deal bc i felt little direction or formal education during my beginnings introductions to the program itself, I thought that I'd never seem to be able to fully commit to fully reading The BigBook which had so many new ideas.  I guess if anything else, the only way to understand most of the necessary ideas and concepts will be only come by reading the book over and over because you just might (more like probably will) pick out something you didn't jive with the previous time so that already is difficult enough I think for most people to either try to try to be educated quickly so the ""work"" can begin on their recovery. 

I even had the skepticism lingering about, and even saw myself getting burned out on the book so I had to put it down before all interest was lost.  I guess it's more importantly understood that some concepts you may only be able to have experience with later in life you're still ""cruising"" on the road they call to recovery.

As someone who kinda likes the feeling, but needs several bottles to get there, is this a point of worry? Also, is the volume consumed or the level of drunkenness more important when it comes to abuse, since based on research I seem to be in the extreme in the prior, but not in the latter. For reference, I don't really feel the urge to drink, but when I do, it takes what feels like what I fell is way, way too much. Should I just not drink?

I’ve been drinking at an exponential rate for the past half of a year. I hate it because I don’t like the off feeling I get the next morning along with many other feelings of guilt or self blame but I don’t care enough to stop. I was going to therapy for my overall mental health but I also stopped that because it felt like while I made progress I was also just running on a treadmill; not actually going anywhere. 
My family has a history of alcoholism to the point one of my uncles killed his liver, got a transplant and then drank that one to his death. I’m both terrified and don’t care at all if I die because death is inevitable. 
This is a cry for help before I hurt my body beyond repair because I hate what I’m doing but when I drink it’s the only time I feel like I don’t wholly hate myself and my existence and I actually even feel some confidence. I also then have the energy to socialize and maybe meet someone I could date but I wouldn’t want them to love this intoxicated version of me anyways.

I've been struggling to write this with all the thoughts going through my head. It's a constant shifting bipolar mess. For the last 2 weeks I have been in the darkest place my mind has traveled. So dark, I felt like I couldn't live anymore. There was no reason to live. For years and years I've struggled with alcohol. Ever since I got my DUI MANY years ago upon returning from back to back deployments. 
As many know I was in a very long relationship that ended because of my drinking in July of 2019. Instead of me thinking it was my fault, I was in denial. I could drink. It was easy. Things began to spiral.. I ended up in California where I sought new beginnings. I continued to Drink. I took advantage. He rightfully was upset with me. But I continued to drink. I went back to Florida, where people whom knew nothing of my past drinking sought help for me and entered me into the VA. The VA kept me for 3 days while I sobered up and sent me on my way. I was in denial still. I stayed with friends while I sought my next move. That move would come with a move to Michigan. I stayed with family, even worked for them. Finding a new career, sent me to knew places. Little did I know it was because it was easier to drink. That turned into a different story, but ended with me back in Michigan at the beginning of the year. I was finally with family whom I never knew like I should've. They knew about my drinking, but never knew about the extent of MY drinking PROMBLEM. They encouraged me to slow down. Even told me it was something I should seek to resolve. well last August I snapped and went on a bender. Drank myself stupid, near death stupid. Blackout for days drunk. I woke up and decided to sober up, it was easy; I could do it myself. I was finally doing it myself, I finally felt  great. Finally found real love. Things were going amazing! I had my family back, an amazing woman with an amazing kid. I had a small hiccup and started to drink again, small. Why not I deserved it. To have a couple of beers after work. I didn't have a drinking problem. The love of my life and nephew/family called me on it. THEY picked me, brushed my shoulders off, and I got back to sober. Here's the thing. I never sought help, and had I, I would've learned about a thing called Dry Drunk. But I could do it on my own remember. Things were slowly becoming tense in my relationships. I was sober, must be the holidays, right? I went on to get back getting life on track. Switching to medical help here. Even started to get the tools to start an adventure into a business, I even started to call around inquiring about getting my license back. Well a week and a half ago is when things turned for the worse. I received a blow to my life that was on track. My time-line for this dream was derailed. I lost it. I went full depression, 0 to 100. I went full dry drunk. I got angry, depressed, full of self-loathing, self-pity. I became someone I hate. My life has always seemed to throw curveballs, ones that I could always still figure out how to connect with. Well this was a curveball that was swung on, missed, and bat thrown. It created immense turmoil rapidly in my relationship. I. Went. Full. Dry Drunk. I used to avoid situations that created confrontation with drinking. I went off the deep end. I left. I ran. Instead of staying and dealing with the turmoil, I ran. I ran right to drinking. Anybody who knows me, knows my ability to put the booze down. I bought 1 bottle. I starred at it. Now anybody that knows anything about alcoholics, knows you can't do sober without help. That bottle won. I took that drink, and the drink took me. It didn't take me like one would think. It didn't take the pain away. It didn't take a bad situation and help. It took my to the single most, deepest, darkest places my mind has gone. She tried. Family Tried. Friends Tried. The drink took me. It got so terrifying, that I hoped the bottle would take all the pain away. When 1 bottle wouldn't work, I tried 2. And when 2 wouldn't help, I tried 3. I wanted all the pain to go away permanently. It wasn't until I woke up days later, not realizing it had been about a week since it all began. I woke up scared. I woke up. Terrified. I had let the drink take me. I called the only people I knew to call, family. And they were there physically and mentally faster than anything you can ask for. I am now on a true path of recovery. The physical pain is nothing over the mental anguish I have experienced in these days sobering up. I am to the point I don't have a hangover. I physically am going through withdrawal. The battle to just drink again to numb the mental pain is real. One minute you tell yourself why does it matter just drink and in the literal blink of an eye, you tell yourself to pull yourself up. Your thoughts of being ashamed of yourself, to wanting to fight for what you had is so fast. You tell yourself, this was just a relapse. Then you remind yourself, 1 relapse is 1 too many. You sit on your phone looking at all the systems in place to help. You tell yourself to use them. You pray, one day your family will forgive you. You pray one day you can get your love back. You pray your friends will forgive you. You hope your journey works itself out. Thank you to all who have been here for me... you know who you are. All I can I do is say sorry. For now.

I hope this is allowed, because I'm really worried and I don't know where else to turn.

I've been drinking around half a bottle to a whole bottle of 1L vodka daily for about three or four months now (mainly escalating to 1L in the past few weeks, but I can't say specifically how long as when really stressed I have drank whole bottles before that, sometimes more). Due to mental health issues, I'm moving in with my brother for a little while, and I'm really scared about withdrawal.

Is this something I should be worried about, should I warn my brother of symptoms to look out for? If so, what symptoms should he and I be looking out for?

If I start experiencing symptoms, what should I do? I'll be in a completely different area (UK to Wales), and really don't want to put further stress on A&E or hospital departments in general. Will my GP still be able to help?

Many thanks in advance for any advice provided, I'm really scared and would hate to legit die at my brother's house as that would be really really unfair on him. I'm suicidal but I'm not an asshole, if that makes sense?

He gained a lot of weight from it in a short period of time (normally a very fit guy) and I didn’t realize it was a serious problem until our relationship was negatively affected by it. I thought he was just “COVID” drinking since we were home all the time. Fail on my part. We had a talk about our relationship being in an odd spot and he said he believes it’s from his drinking and poured all his alcohol down the drain. He lost a ton of weight in just 2 weeks of not drinking and is just about back to his normal size now that he’s stopped drinking for little over a month. The quick weight drop made me reflect and realize how much of an issue he really had over those 6 months. I guess my focus was mainly on the new baby so I didn’t realize at the time. 

Fast forward to yesterday, his birthday. I made a nice dinner and got him a kombucha to replace what would normally be a glass of wine.

I am grateful for the feedback, and a second chance to put my voice into the conversation. 
 
  
I was a regular liar. There.  I said it.  I am an alcoholic too. Lying and alcoholism go together like _______ (insert your favorite expression here).  I lied to myself so much that I started believing my lies. My biggest ones included: “I can stop drinking when I really want to.” “My drinking isn’t hurting anyone else.” “ I can’t be an alcoholic because I have a good full-time job  (high school principal).”

When I was in my early twenties (early 1970’s) I worked as a psychiatric attendant in  a major university medical center hospital.  It was a fantastic experience on so many levels. I interacted with people at some of the worst moments in their lives.  Some were depressed and suicidal, some in full blown manic episodes (aka bipolar disorder), some homicidal, some withdrawing from drugs/alcohol, some psychotic, some with obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) to the point of not being able to function, people with eating disorders, Alzheimer’s, dementia and just about every curse that can be visited on man.  Right. (Some people literally had curses put on them and they needed relief.  One of the staff psychiatrists specialized in “root removal” – the southern version of having a curse put on you.) The patients on the ward were young, old, in-between, rich and poor, black and white. It was a privilege to work there, to see people get better and to be a part of their recovery.  It was also an incredible training/educational opportunity for me as I got to participate in all kinds of classes and seminars. But I digress…

So back to the lying thing.  One day on the ward a young medical doctor was admitted for drug addiction issues. He was the Chief Resident in Cardiology, was bright and engaging, and had his whole life in front of him. He also was self-injecting drugs and had become addicted – and had gotten caught. Now he was a patient in a locked psychiatric unit in the hospital where the day before he was saving lives on the heart unit.  I met him within the first hour that I came on duty.  He was charming and witty and it didn’t seem to me that anything was wrong.  Several days went by and he just kind of hung out on the unit. The attending psychiatrist had placed him on “Cannot Leave the Unit” orders.  This meant that he could not leave even with an escort to go anywhere in the hospital.  One Sunday morning, the charge nurse who ran the place like a field marshal in a war, managed to get permission to take him for a brief walk to his office.  She was told to take two male attendants with them, and I was one of them, and to never let him out of sight. We walked him to his hospital office to get some articles and journals he needed.  Later that day we were all summoned to the nurse’s station to explain how he had gotten the drugs that he smuggled back onto the unit.

I was young and confused. We pieced it together and – of course—it was hidden in the journals on his bookshelf. The attending physician sat us down and told me something I have never forgotten.  “The best addicts and alcoholics are the best liars. The smarter they are, and the older they are, the better liars they are. Addicts don’t get to be old if they’re not good liars. They die first.” I have never forgotten that point. Never.
I later became an alcoholic.  I don’t know when I crossed that line, but I did cross it. I told a lot of lies in my drinking days.  I lied to family, friends, parents, co-workers, bosses, therapists, police, lawyers, and judges. I lied for years. I lied to myself all the time.  Call it denial, rationalization or whatever else.  Bottom line is that I was lying -- all the time.  My truth is that I would say anything to anyone at anytime as long I thought that it would buy me more time.  More time to drink again. Maybe in twenty minutes, maybe tomorrow.  That was all that mattered.  I actually “believed my own bullshit.” I was so facile at lying.  Now friends, that’s scary. My truth is that the only thing that mattered in the whole world was to be able to drink. This is hard to explain to non-alcoholics.  It is not logical.  If it were, this problem would not be so vexing and intractable. Lying allowed me to buy time, and time meant chance for another drink.

So here’s the deal. I was not to be trusted. I really did not know the true from the false. My lying was as out-of-control as was my drinking. I had been a heavy drinker. I was now an alcoholic. Once I started drinking I could not stop. One drink was too many, and a thousand were not enough.

I have buried relatives (including my younger brother), friends, and acquaintances who have died young from the ravages of alcoholism. Looking back, they were all liars when it came to their drinking. I hang around lots of alcoholics and addicts. The clean and sober ones have learned to tell the truth. The ones active in their alcoholism have not.
 
In A.A. I asked a wise old veteran to be my sponsor – to help me.  He appeared to have what I wanted most – serenity and peace. The very first time we got together he said, “There is only one thing I absolutely require or I won’t be able to help. I need you to be honest with me.” I hesitated a few seconds, and said “okay.” That was 20 years ago. I put down the drink and the lie. I have had twenty really good years since then.",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39541018}"

My oldest sibling is an alcoholic and has been for quite some time now. And its really draining being around him when he's intoxicated or what we call ""dry drunk"" (its a term we made up for when he showcases some behaviours that he'd only have when he's drunk, or wanting to drink). 

He is emotionally / mentally / verbally / and physically (occasionally) abusive, and will constantly tell us to drop dead, go off ourselves, or that he'll off us in various ways. He extends this treatment to our nieces as well by yelling in their faces, calling them fat and ugly and whatever hurtful things he can come up with (he's never laid a hand on them). He also has a tendency of lying through his teeth, its gotten to a point where I cannot believe a thing he says to me anymore. He will lie about anyone and anything, he doesn't seem to care - or he may actually believe the things that come out of his mouth. 

My brother has this whole Dr. Jeckyll / Mr. Hyde persona, where he's nice and kind and generous to his friends. But when he's come? its a whole different story, he steals our food (I come from a place where we hunt/fish - so all food is harvested and cut and preserved by hand. And the food he takes is valuable since it is also seasonal food.) and gives it away to his friends / bootlegger for a bottle. He also takes valuables, or even sometimes useless things from the house / our sisters' place to feed his alcohol addiction. 

He also lives at home full time, and cannot hold a job because of his addiction. He also thinks he's the king of the house, even though he pays no bills, nor rent, and he will guard the food from everyone but my father. And he acts like he owns everything in our household, sometimes I can't even get myself a snack from the pantry because he'll be on my back about it. (Important to note that, my brother DOES pay for groceries occasionally, but ultimately it is myself and my father that buys things for the house.) 

He has some very concerning behaviour when he's intoxicated, he talks to himself as if we're replying to him (we're not, sometimes we're in a whole other room in the house, or the person he's talking to isn't even around), he's very explosive with his temper and will snap at any little thing. He also snaps at us about things that have never happened / we don't know about. I'm really worried about his brain activity, or something psychological that went undetected or something that was never diagnosed? I'm not sure whats going on with him, but the things in this paragraph have only started happening maybe 3-4 years ago and its getting worse. 

He and i are the only ones living at home with our father right now, and my father rarely sees any of my brothers negative behaviours because my brother hides it from him. And my father refuses to remove my brother from the home because he's worried he'll do something to himself, or he just wont be able to survive on his own.

I hit a low point about a year in when I didn’t want to drink, but it was like I was being compelled (or pulled) to mix up a drink after work. 

Then came the “I don’t want to drink” in the elevator leaving work, where something invisible in my chest would feel like it was literally pulling me across the street to buy another bottle.

Eventually, after a lot of weight gain, dehydration, and drink-related low moods, I got a handle on it. In other words, three drinks became two. Two became one, at which point I’d go 5-7 days without alcohol. 

But that weird “pull” feeling hasn’t gone away. Like an electric sensation in my chest; a quick “you know you want a drink” tug by something inside. 

Only happens for a second. Always goes away. Every time it happens, I think “I wonder if that’s what heroin users feel—that overwhelming urge to use?” At least I assume that’s what the feeling is.

I’ve been on literally every medication on the market for ADD and found Vyvanse to be the best by far but my lack of medical insurance and budget only allows me Adderall. 

I was on Adderall for years before Vyvanse and know how harsh it can be and that it can be abused but I never felt like I had any sort of addiction to it while I was on it. Just a lot of side effects that I was happy to give up when Vyvanse was suggested by my doctor. 

I asked a medical professional in my AA network their take on it but they were strongly opposed to the idea. I want to note, they did not have ADD themselves or  where trained on the disorder nor do they know me past a couple of phone calls. They mentioned a bunch of things about the disorder that were just plain inaccurate so  I’m very skeptical of their opinion on this particular subject. I do trust their word on general matters of sobriety and want to take their word for it but I really dont think they were qualified to give good advice on this topic. 

I’m going to talk to a psychiatrist about it but I really feel like getting back on a prescribed and monitored ADD medication would really help most aspects of my life; most importantly, the ability to focus on my sobriety exactly when I need to focus on my sobriety.

At first, it was just because I was bored and stuck in my dorm room. Then it was a way of coping with family drama. Then school stressors. Then existential fear. Then it was just something I did every night. 

Having around 3 drinks a night, always after dinner, not during the day. I tell myself that because it's not edging into my waking life, and never drink myself sick, it's no big deal. I don't drink as much as a lot of people I see, so it's no big deal. I'm a responsible drinker, so it's no big deal. 

My dad was an alcoholic, and my mom knows the signs. She tells me I have a problem, and I get upset, even though I know she's right. That's probably why I get upset. 

I just want some advice. What do you do instead of getting drunk? How do you fight the impulse? The flesh is weak, and the spirit is weak, too.",12,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7079883}"

My Alcoholic boyfriend broke up with me on 1/1/21

So i am desperate for help and advice from anyone who has been in a relationship with an alcoholic or recovering alcoholic. 

My Ex boyfriend and I were together for a year and a half. When I met him he was sober for two years.  We met in august 2019...We started off amazing we had soo much love for each other so early on.  He even talked about getting married and moving in together within 3 months of the relationship.  So much love bombing.  Well   The months went on and things were good. He even moved into an apartment next to my families business an apartment that my family owned.  I was able to see him everyday, I brought him food everyday after he got home from work, my families business is a restaurant, I would get him water when I went on supply runs and his stupid monsters. Anyway that doesn’t matter.  

April 2020 when Covid hit it hit us hard. We love on the east coast NY/NJ area. My father who was 73 died of the virus. Then eight weeks later my grandfather died of the virus. My BF and I were trying to quarantine from each other bc I had gotten it and was really sick. By the time my dad died I was ok.  He died April 6th.  A few days later was his funeral. My BF didn’t come bc we had to limit it to just 7 family members. It was so hard.  I didn’t hear from my BF all day that day and knew something was wrong. It just wasn’t like him. I finally went to see him and when he opened the door my worst fear was realized, he relapsed and relapsed bad. The day of my fathers funeral.  He was crying and said he couldn’t be there for me and felt horrible.  I had to clean him up after he puked and got him some food after.  He kept saying I was the best thing that ever happened to him. Side note in the beginnjng when we started he said if he ever started to drink again he would break up with me.  Anyway, he said he loved me and knew he at least had me.  

After that day I had to monitor him for weeks since he was furloughed from his job (his family was from the Midwest and no one lived here near him just me).  He said to me if he ate he wouldn’t drink bc it would kill his buzz.  So for weeks I went to his apartment before 9 (THATS when the closest liquor store opened) and made sure we ate breakfast together.  It worked most of the time, but he relapsed a few times after that. By the end of May he was sober again.  The summer was uneventful but I saw the relapse really left him shook.  We took a short trip to my family’s beach home in the summer and I finally asked him about the drinking (I never brought it up) he said he didn’t want to eff up all the hard work he had done. He has four kids but only one talks to him. So he said he didn’t want to mess up his relationship with his daughter his family and he said especially me.  I thought he was on a good path and we were gonna be stronger.  

Come October things were starting to become off, he withdrew from me, stopped communicating as much, didn’t want me to sleep over as much. We stopped having sex.  He was off. We had an argument for a week and didn’t talk. I finally went to talk to him and he kept saying that “the writing was in the wall that this wasn’t gonna work” he said he was gonna be stuck in that apartment forever. It was weird. He was upset we didn’t live together. Btw I have a 23 year old daughter in law school who will be done next year which I wanted to wait till she was done.  
So the that night I text him that no matter what I loved him and wanted the future with him. I thought he would ignore me but he text me back I love you.  I said can we talk tomorrow night which was gonna be Friday and he said yes. Well Friday came and he just hugged me and said he loved me and we didn’t talk about anything. He just wanted to go back to the way things were, which were pretty abismal, no sex, we never went out, always stayed in his apartment watching tv then he would go to bed at 8:00 the latest BC he would wake up at 4:30 am.  It was a miserable three months.  Come december things looked like they were turning around. He started to communicate more with me wanting to spend more time with me. He even bought a new sofa that was a love seat bc putting it in his terms so we could “cuddle” on the couch together.   Come Christmas he was better not perfect but better still no sex though.  He got us this beautiful gift , a trip! Come April we were gonna go away. He wrote in the card that he loved me and that he wanted this year to be better for us and he said we can start fresh with a trip alone together.  I was soo happy after the horrible year of so much loss I had.  

That Sunday before New Years we were so excited for our trip stayed up late watching videos on it and planning it. I was over the moon happy.  He said he wanted it to be romantic and fun. The next day I told him that my daughter wouldn’t be able to watch his dog the week we go in April bc she has her law school finals that week and she had to watch my two dogs as well.  But I said no worries my cousin who loves his dog was gonna watch the dog plus his two ferrets and his fish.  I thought he would be ok with that. He said well that’s ridiculous. I said why it’s taken care of. Well he was still kinda upset for the next few days so I didn’t bring it up I figured he would let it go eventually.  I went to see him NYE and he came over to me hugged me and kissed me and said he loved me. I figured that was his way to say sorry. I had to work that night so I wasn’t gonna see him but in my gut I knew something was wrong.  I went to see him the next day and he wouldn’t let me into his apartment. Kept telling me to go home leave him alone let it be. I pushed my way through and said no we need to talk this is crazy. He said he wasn’t happy with the way things were going. He said we were suppose to be living together by now and he said he felt like he was last( by far the opposite of how things were). I told him with all that went on through the year and my dad dying and me having to help run the family restaurant it was impossible to think of moving in together... as well plus my daughter still had another year of law school. I didn’t know what the rush was? His last two relationships where he lived with his GFs ended in less than a year! DIDNT make sense.  I asked him do you love me he said I don’t know then at the end of the conversation I asked again do you love me and he said no.  I got up took the jewelry he gave me throughout the relationship and said if you don’t love me I can’t do anything else, I said I love you and left. I didn’t speak to him for two weeks. This past Friday I was a mess I text him something generic I said “I hate to bother you but can I have my daughters boots she gave me” he responded and hour later with “of course, they are in a box with your other stuff” I didn’t respond back. That night I wrote him a hand written letter saying that I loved him and knew he was going through something or battling his demons and was here for him. It was a long letter I said some things I was sad about but mostly positive stuff.  I taped it to his front door.  That was this past Saturday 1/16 yesterday morning I still hadn’t heard from him so I went to finally see him and when he opened the door he said oh you want your things? I said no did you read my letter and he said yeah I need time to process it.  I was like can we talk he said no I have to go I’m going to an AA meeting I found one I really like I said that’s great.  But when can we talk he said I don’t know not know I can’t deal with this right now. I need to go I said so you really don’t love me he said “ Babe I don’t love you” standing there with the cross I gave him that I engraved I love you on! I said fine and I left. I’m done now I’m not gonna text him back or call him.  The hard thing he lives right where I work and I see when he comes home everyday bc it’s my families property.  Please anyone who has advice please help me! I feel so discarded. I didn’t do anything to deserve this. I stood by him even when I was unhappy.  And he was soo cold. This once sweet man who loved me soo much was like ice now. I knew he relapsed again but this was too much.  Do you think I’ll here from him again? Btw he owes me money I gave him to start an account for us. I wanted him to start it to prove we would eventually use it to buy a house.  $4000!

Feels like too much coffee.,"I used to drink about 6 beers per day for several years. I only drank at night in the last two hours before bed. I never felt drunk or even hungover from this level of drinking.

However, one thing I noticed is that during the day time (while sober), I would often feel a physical sense of unease that is a bit hard to describe; the best way I can put it is that it almost felt like I had drank too much coffee. It was moderately uncomfortable and affected my quality of life.

I couldn't figure out what was wrong, and tried adjusting many things, like diet, exercise, and etc., to no avail. Finally I decided to lower my drinking. I went from 6 to 4 beers and my discomfort decreased by a large amount, but was still present. I went from 4 to 2 beers, and got better and better. Finally I went from 1 to 0 beers and the feeling has completely disappeared.

I'm not sure what exactly was the root cause of this feeling, but I know it was something to due with alcohol, as it seemed to be dose-dependent - the less I drink on a daily basis, the less I get this weird feeling.

We have been together for 4 years and the dynamic of our relationship has always been that I'm rarely drink and I think he drinks too much. He has always claimed he drinks a perfectly normal amount, but even friends of his that go back to his childhood have expressed their concern to him and to me about the quantity he consumes. He gets very defensive and annoyed at the accusation. 

He typically has 3-4 short drinks every evening and will drink most of the day on the weekends. He can easily go through a bottle of vodka or whiskey in a couple days during the week and in one night on the weekend. I began to grow concerned when I found a flask in the driver side door of our car a few months back. Then I found an empty bottle of vodka in his desk drawer at home. I did try to discuss my concerns with him at that time and again he got very defensive and—I felt—was making excuses. He started to get very annoyed with me and tried turning the conversation around on me and compared his drinking to how often I eat ice cream. So not true and actually a very unfair comparison in my opinion. We left the conversation at me explaining to him I just wanted him to know I was concerned and he said, ""Your concern is noted."" I backed off him for awhile after that and because he did seem like he was making an effort to drink less. Lately though I'm seeing red flags again.

The other night I saw he had a bottle of vodka out of sight in a cabinet. Immediately I sensed he was trying to hide it from me because usually the bottle is on top of the fridge or on the counter. I went into his office the next day to talk to him and he reacted as though I caught him doing something wrong and was actively trying to hide something at his side. It was the vodka from the cabinet and he was pouring it into a pop can. He said he feels his meetings and phone calls with customers go smoother when he has a little alcohol. I told him if he feels like he needs to hide it then that's not a good thing. He said he was only hiding it because he didn't want a ""talking to"" from me. Yesterday while he was out I went to check on that bottle of vodka and it was completely empty. He came home with another bottle, which I also spotted in the same cabinet as before. He had already drank a good portion of it. This morning that bottle is nearly empty and I KNOW he took some with him this morning as he left the house.

My anxiety and worry is on overdrive right now. I worry he's getting carried away and I'm also hesitant to raise the topic again with him given his reaction last time. I really need some advice here. 

TL;DR My boyfriend is exhibiting signs of alcohol dependency but he is in complete denial and acts as though I'm the one with the problem. How can I help him recognize his dependency without feeling attacked? I want to be as understanding and supportive as possible. I love this man and want to marry him.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5976733}"

He's an alcoholic. Has been since I can remember

There were days when I would sneak into his closet and see the Jack Daniel's case almost empty, when I found it full a week earlier.

When I smelled alcohol, I knew to lock myself up in my room and tell my younger brothers to do the same. I was homeless at 17, because I couldn't bear his house, and moved into a relative's house later that year.

But he still says he loves me. He still reminds me of when he held me when I was young and sang ""Hallelujah"" to me. I sent him a Christmas card and he has it in his hospital room and claims he stares at it every day.

I keep hoping that things will change. If he lives, and gets a liver transplant, maybe he will change. Maybe our relationship will change. Maybe I can forgive him.

I'm just so lost, confused, and devastated.

The worst thing about it is that we told our family. We told the court. We told the police. We knew that he was an alcoholic. Nobody believed us.

Now it's coming back to bite him.

If you are an alcoholic, please hear me. Please listen to my story. I would give anything for him to have led a normal life, without the amount of alcohol he consumed. 

If somebody tells you that somebody is an alcoholic, it's for a reason. Please, listen to them. Listen to them before it's too late. Get that person help, whether they need it or not. It's always better to be safe than sorry. If one person would have listened to us, maybe they would've saved a life.

I’ve made the awesome choice that I’m done with alcohol.  I’ve been lurking on this page for awhile and have gotten so much inspiration and info.  I called and made an appointment with my doctor today for next week.  

Little backstory.  For 5 or 6 years now I’ve enjoyed a little bourbon in the evenings after work.  Wasn’t a nightly thing but most nights.  I’m talking less than half a pint.  Well, due to a really bad breakup and then quarantine. It’s now 3/4 of a fifth on weeknights and binge drinking the whole weekend.  Lately, on Mondays and Tuesdays I’m so nauseous that I can’t eat anything.  Especially Mondays as I’m usually have pretty bad withdrawals at work.  Hot/cold flashes, hands shaky, cold sweats, fast heartbeat.  Come Wednesday the stomach issue subsided and I can eat again.  Also, the withdrawal stuff usually is gone and I can wait my normal 20-21 hours between drinking with no issue.  My beast friend had this same cycle including the stomach issues.  Turns out it was pancreatitis.  He tried to go cold turkey after a two week bender and ended up on the floor seizing at work and spent 3 days in the icu.  Which brings me to my main point.  I’m absolutely terrified of this happening to me.  If It
I would not only lose my daughters who I have full custody of but also my job......a good job.  

So my questions for those that have done the medical detox.....what exactly do I ask my doctor?  I’m not even sure if he will give me anything.  I’ve researched now for about a week and the most common/successful method seems to be the Valium ween.  I’ve decided that’s what I’d like to try.  Do I just ask him for that right out?  I don’t wanna seem like I’m trying to score pills.  Do I wait and see what, if anything he offers?  Or do I just start by saying (after I give him details of my problem) that I think I need something to help with detox?  I also think I will need something to help with my already large anxiety problem for this to work.  Do I just ask for that as well?  And even something (even OTC) for the insomnia.  Insomnia causes my anxiety to explode!  

For this that have done this.  Does the meds help a little or a lot?  Does it make it bearable or can you be pretty much functional?  What symptoms does it help with the most or least?  Any help is appreciated beyond belief.  I just
Gotta stop.  I don’t even enjoy it.  I just do it to keep from getting sick!

TL/DR
For those that have done medical detox how did you approach your DR and were you specific when asking for benzo help?  Which symptoms did it help with the most and least and to what degree does it help overall?",4,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5668295}"

   I know I’ve had a problem for awhile now. I’m almost 23 and have been drinking almost every day since I turned 21. My dad and his dad and who knows how long it goes back, have all been (dad still is) an alcoholic. I had to move back home from college (graduated last spring) and because of the pandemic, I haven’t been able to/nor is it financially smart, to move out. I have been trying desperately to quit drinking, especially these last few months. I’ve been successful for maybe a week or so here and there, but I always tend to fall back into it. The largest problem is, is that my dad, who I live with, is also an alcoholic as I stated, so alcohol is always in the house. There have been so many nights where I don’t allow myself to go out and buy alcohol, but then my dad mentions he’s going to the corner store, and I fold and ask him to get me something. He’s told me he doesn’t want me to end up like him, but he’ll always buy me some if I ask. I could ask him to say no to me, however I’ll just end up scrounging for any of his left over after he goes to bed. 

 It’s terrible, and I feel like living in this house is making things so much harder for me. I’m really good at not allowing myself to buy anything and killing time until I know the corner stores are closed and I have no option but to not drink. I know I need to move out, but that really isn’t feasible for me right now. I want to quit so badly, but resisting is just so frustratingly hard.

I plan on getting rid of the alcohol in my house and I’ve began using an app to track my progress, but does anyone have tips on keeping myself busy and working through these issues while I’m at home all day with no social interaction? 

I also am in Canada so it’s pretty cold here right now so exercising outside isn’t ideal lol.

I want that and to keep getting better but this damn addiction keeps dragging me back down, it’d be so much easier without the depression pulling me back down.

Lots of stoic readings, picking up old hobbies like some of my favorite games or collecting cards like I used to helped a lot but wore off after a bit. I just graduated college in December and just feel stuck in a rut/cycle of drinking to prepare me for work and the social anxiety of customers and such, getting off work. Swinging by a gas station or liquor stores picked me up more shots and just blocking it all out, all the bad thoughts and loneliness that creeps back in.

I started getting withdrawals on day 2 of drinking 24 beer a day and checked myself into emergency at my local hospital. Typically they'll hit you with 30 mg valium then send you home with 30 mg more.

My vitals were so fucked at triage they immediately found me a bed in the gynecology unit no less. This is a hospital notorious for 6-12 hr wait times.
Over an 8 hour period I was administered 240 mg iv valium in 30 mg injections. My vitals remained stable in the 190/100 hr and 90-100 bpm despite the drugs and still having a significant amount of booze in my system. I didn't feel intoxicated at all and was carrying on casual conversations with the nurses which alarmed the doctor enough to admit me and I ended up staying in another hospital. On my second day I ended up having a seizure. I didn't catch my bp but my hr shot up to 163 bpm. I've never had a needle shot into my arm faster but it was a huge dose of lorazepam after which the nurse told me I was going ""to sleep like a baby"". It had almost no effect but it did arrest the seizure almost right away. My GABA receptors are fucked but somehow my liver is still healthy.

That was four days ago and I just got home now and it feels like I just woke up from a dream. Fuck alcohol l. If I ever end up in that situation again and have a less sympathetic ER doctor I could easily go home and die alone in my apartment.

2021-01-13 17:42:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/kwrxhk/i_lost_my_grandma_in_may/,I lost my grandma in May,"I don't know where else to write/post about this. I've written in my journal many times but I haven't fully healed from losing her and yesterday we got her cause of death.

My grandma was the kindest woman you'll have ever met. I'm serious. She taught me what kindness was and lived at my family home, taking care of me and my sibling between age nine to thirteen. She would take us to places that our parents deemed ""sketchy"", but in reality were just places that people ""lower than our tax bracket"" frequented. My grandma would be kind to everyone there and go out of her way to talk to homeless people and others down on their luck. I had never seen anyone I knew do this before and it shaped me into the kinder and more empathetic person that I am today. She was so caring. She was only 42 when I was born, so I was blessed to have a caretaker in my formative years who could still move and play with me and my younger sibling. We lived in a different province for most of my childhood and in the summer my parents would send us to hers for two weeks; they were the best two weeks of my year, every single year. One summer it was over 40 degrees (Celsius) and there was a heat warning so my brother and I weren't allowed to go play outside as we did every day normally; my grandma instead got a big tub of cold water and put it outside and let my brother and i stand in it so that we got the opportunity to just be outside and experience the day. Every morning, early before my sibling woke up she would be sitting in bed, writing in her journal, and I would crawl under the covers with her and she would put on the cartoons and just chat with me. I'll never forget the smell of cigarettes on a muggy, hot day; they'll always remind me of her, sitting on a chair on her front lawn, smoking and laughing and yelling out to me and my brother as we played. She loved people. Everyone she could talk to, she would. And I never met someone who didn't love her back.

When I was about 12 I heard yelling coming from the entrance on the side of our house to her basement suite. My father was yelling at her for stealing half a 26 of grey goose from us and filling it with water. She was crying. Apparently it wasn't the first time. Up until that point, I had no idea she drank regularly. She never drank when she was taking care of us, and I always chalked her shakes up to her arthritis. When I was 13 I had a friend over and my grandma took her meds with her vodka and began ranting about miscellaneous anecdotes from her life. I remember being unbelievably embarrassed. I told my mom, and she got so angry. I didn't understand why she was *so* mad... but my mom had been through this sort of thing more times with my grandma than I could ever comprehend.

As I got older and my grandma moved out and I saw her less frequently, I tried asking her to quit. I tried cheering her on when we would see each other and she would tell me that it had been a couple days since she had last drank. I was a young teen; I didn't understand addiction. My mom was always resentful towards my grandma and I didn't understand why until I got older and she told me more stories from her childhood and revealed the depths of my grandma's alcoholism and how many ways in which she had hurt my mother. I took this resentment as my own and held onto it. I got annoyed when my grandma would message me. I saw goodness and badness as black and white. I would still message her back most of the time, but I wouldn't put in more effort than I felt was required to talk to her. She was so young; I felt like I had time to get over my resentment. She would still be around. 

We got a call from my aunt in late May. She was in hysterics, saying that my grandma had died. The police had contacted her. I didn't believe it. I thought that they for sure had the wrong person. I felt like I was floating out of my body. Not her. There was no way. But it was true. We went to her home to clear out her things and she had left her pan from dinner on the stove, a plate with leftovers on it to have the next day. She had stocked up on shampoo and conditioner because there was a sale at the drug store. Her cabinets were fully stocked with food. She had pictures of my brother and I, my mother and her siblings EVERYWHERE. They were in frames covering the walls. She had saved everything we had ever given her, even the stupid DIY keychains with shitty little drawings from when we were four. Even the invitations to my first, second, third birthdays that my mom made and sent out. We looked through her journals and there were dozens, maybe hundreds of letters to me, my mom, my uncle. She wrote an entry on the day she found out my mom was pregnant with me and wrote unborn me a letter. She wrote me letters all through my first years of life. There was also a duffel bag stuffed with empty mickeys of vodka. She bought one every single day.

A neighbour saw us crying out front of my grandma's building. She asked what had happened, and when we told her her face fell. She talked about what a kind woman my grandma was. We had never met this woman, had never seen her or heard of her, but she took one look at my mom and asked if she was ""\*name\*, who worked at \*mom's workplace\*?"" She said my grandma always talked about how proud she was of her to anyone who would listen. That's the woman my grandma was.

It's so hard to process it. I don't know how to stop feeling this anger toward her: how could she leave us? Why am I so angry at her for drinking? And further, how can I stop being angry at myself? We got her phone back from the police yesterday and on her last day alive, she was just trying to reach out and talk to someone. Not me, but a couple of her friends and those close to her. Covid may not have killed her in the way we tend to think of, but it killed her in the sense that she was so lonely that it drove her to drink more. But what if I had reached out to her more? What if we talked regularly? Would she still be here? Maybe it's selfish and self-centered to believe that I could have changed things that much, but I can't help but wonder. She was so young. I don't know how to reconcile this loss, but I do know that I hope she has been reborn into a kitten, or a puppy, or a bird so that she can feel peace and freedom and be relieved of the burden of being a human. I hope when she is done that life that she can be reborn as a baby and live the life her soul deserves. I hope right now she's one of the hummingbirds that visits my feeder every morning. I hope she sees me and feels recognition and love. 

She died of alcohol poisoning. Please love the people closest to you and please, please, please forgive them. I understand I came out unscathed from this relationship but someday it may be too late to forgive. Try to extend love to everyone around you, especially if they are dealing with and addiction as debilitating as this one. I love you grandma, and I love all of you as well.

I was pregnant during this time which I think is most likely what kept me sober for that long. The moment I got home after the baby being born I drank fernet we got to put in Christmas cookies. Why did we have it in the house you say? Because my alcoholism had convinced me I was the one in control. I talked with my partner and we decided I could drink in moderation. Right? So we bought a bottle of fernet and two mini bottles of rum (for Christmas cookies), two boxes of wine (red and white because I obviously need both to be fancy), and a bottle of baileys  in case I wanted an excuse to drink in the mornings. A lot of booze you say? Well not nearly enough for this alcoholic! I ran through that in about three or four days. I was hiding the booze because we had family around and they know about how severe my alcoholism is and we didn't want them to know I had started drinking again. I was drinking out of one of those reusable cups with a straw. Big mistake. A sippy cup full of night night juice! The last two days of the week and a half I drank I bought a handle of whiskey. The cheap stuff. I hid it in my sock drawer on top of the countless empty boxes of wine. Well, I ran through that in a single day. Fu#$. I needed more but didn't have money, so I called my brother and said I needed money for diapers. I went and bought another handle of whiskey and forgot the damn diapers. Well, my partner found my stash of empties and I was obviously in a bad way. He confronted me and I became verbally abusive to him. He ended up having to call my dad who came over and gave me a reality check. I'm so ashamed of myself.

My hand is so unbearably cold held out, but that isn't the problem. My thumb is up, but see how you've crushed the rest closed. I'm trying, won't someone else grab hold. Stop your sculpting, nicer to mold me quick. I thank you, but this pain is significant to me. My life is too long to get this right. Let's pretend I'm done for the hardest revelation to come. These raindrops I lose fall on no one. But now that guy has stopped here for me. I wish I could keep you my sweet clarity, auf wiedersehen. This hand you held can shake any heat now. 

Damn you sobriety. You're killing me, but thanks for the lift. This hand won't move right. How strange. Where are we this time, and why am I so light? Hmm.

Is everything that’s going on in the news lately stressing anyone else out? This week sure felt like a year to me anyway.

My last drink was on Monday December 28th, I’d been on a 4 day bender after having a couple weeks of sobriety. I’ve been hanging in there, but my quitting coincided with this fucking INSANE math class I have to take. It’s 3 classes rolled into one, and while it should count for 15 credits you only receive 7 (a large portion is either meets or does not meet standards). I don’t work on fridays and I spent 9 hours working on it yesterday. Rather than doing material for one class, completing it and moving on to the next, this professor has us doing all 3 at the same time. She is also having us do THREE group projects, despite this entire class being online.

Part of my sickness is fear of failure, another part is anxiety and having very poor coping skills to deal with it. Last night I couldn’t sleep because I am so stressed out about this stupid class. I knew exactly where there was a half gallon of gin, and I wanted to drink so bad, but I didn’t. So I guess that’s one positive. But I’m 30 years old, and the amount of regrets I have are insane. This is shit I should have been doing 10 years ago, not now. It’s so much harder with a kid and full time work on top of it. I just feel like such a fucking DUD and like I’m drowning...but again, at least I’m not drowning in booze for once.

I used to be an avid poster in this forum but I'm happier to say now that my drinking is more in control than it was and is (I guess weirdly) doctor approved (he's just happy it's not a 5th a day anymore) lately I drink maybe 3 or 4 days out of the week when I'm relaxing

Anyway currently I'm on a medication for the next 10 days that I cannot drink while taking and oh my God I am so bored. I've realized one of the mistakes I made was using alcohol to make other things (video games, youtube, tv, cooking) more ""fun"" or ""interesting"" and now that I'm forced to be so ER for a bit it sucks seeing that I'm not enjoying these things if I'm not doing them while drunk. 

I feel like I've ruined hobbies for myself because I never even really noticed I paired relaxing and my hobbies with drinking. Now it's making me think hard about when this 10 day dry streak is over and how to handle it now. I hate that I'm sitting there playing a game and my brain is just rampant with ""if you were drunk this would actually be fun"" 

So I suppose my question is what do you all do with your newfound sobriety time? Exercise isnt really in the question for me currently aside from low impact stuff (I dislocated my knee!) So I can't do much of that.
I know it sounds silly but do I just...do the hobbies anyway? Like while sober? They just don't feel the same. The day before yesterday was the last day I drank and I still have 10 days to go. It's SO hard getting myself to do anything. I usually love to cook but I went into my kitchen last night, cleaned up for about 30 min and then just didn't want to anymore. I just lost interest completely and nuked some chef boyardee and went to bed hella depressed. I was gonna make baked chicken and mac and cheese but I just felt sad and it f*cking sucked. I thought though maybe if I get some NEW hobbies that haven't been trained with the idea of drinking that things would be easier but now I can't find anything to hold my attention (thanks ADHD) Not to mention my stupid alcohol brain just goes back to ""drinking will make this more fun"" 
On my regular dry days nowadays I just kinda slump in bed after lots of schoolwork and errands. I don't cook and just kinda ""flop"" in bed cuz I'm typically tired. Should I spend the whole 10 days doing that? I don't want to. I want to actually address this issue even after this dry spell but how do I fall back in love with things I'm convinced aren't worth it to do while sober??",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82201177}"

I’ve been waking up every morning the past year feeling like absolute shit and telling myself, today is the day you quit, with no success. it would always get to some point in the afternoon when I’m finished work or errands and I would just start drinking. 

Everyday I would justify my actions to myself and get so frustrated with myself that it turned into this vicious cycle. I feel like everyday I’ve just been living to get to the afternoon so I can start drinking. 

Two days ago I decided that today is the day. I can’t keep lying to myself and making excuses, it needs to be done. It sucks, my moods swings, not really knowing what to do with myself because I’m used to drinking and playing video games.. I just feel a little lost and I don’t like feeling grumpy and angry towards the people around me. Anyway, I hope it gets better, I’m praying it get better.

I’m 20 yrs old, a junior in college, and have recently discovered that it is very very hard for me to watch or know my friends are getting drunk just for the hell of it. Last night, my SO got drunk with some friends for the first time in a while. I couldn’t sleep at all and I was anxious beyond words. What bothered me the most was that I was almost angry at them for just casually getting drunk for the fun of it. This type of thinking is really unlike me and makes me feel even more guilty over the way I was acting. I am stuck as to how I should confront this, as I would like to tell my SO but don’t want to sound as if I’m overreacting or taking my anger out on them. I know they had a good time and I don’t want to ruin it by bringing up just how anxious and upset I was feeling while they were out.

My dad is a serious alcoholic and after seeing him hurt my family and friends constantly, get 2 DUIs, and not think he was in any way the problem, it’s been exceptionally difficult for me to relate with those who see getting drunk as just something fun and exciting. I understand why people drink and know that many haven’t had an experience like mine.

Ive taken small 2 week breaks but never a full month. Am i paranoid that it can get worse, or that its bad for my mental health. Or am i just a rwgular drinker with a ok relationship with alcohol.

I'd love to hear any experiences anyone has had quitting drinking by gradually tapering off alcohol.  I'm familiar with the techniques from groups like HAMS, like just reduce your consumption by 2 drinks a day until to are at zero.  But I run into a problem.

I binge drink in response to stress but my ""everyday drinking"" is to help me sleep.  I can come off a binge of a few days where I've had 15 - 20 units a day and gradually cut down to 8 units...but there I get stuck.  That's because I need 4 units to get to sleep at night (two doubles) which will keep me asleep for about four hours.  Then I wake up with terrible anxiety and cannot get back to sleep until--you guessed it--I have two more doubles.  The rare times I have less will be when I didn't have the middle-of-the-night wake up and that pretty much only happens when I stay up really late, so I am super tired anyways.

Right now, I am thinking it will be better to taper not by drink count but by checking my BAC and just working to  stretch out the time I am at 0.00%.  That's what I have been doing the last couple days.  But I would like to hear what others have tried that either did or didn't work for them.

She just finished probation for the second just before Christmas. She was on a portable breathalyzer 3 times a day until probation ended. Since then there have been many nights where she acts like she's been drinking.

Its hard to explain but she acts very different when she's been drinking. Her mannerisms and motor control changes and her ability to be logical and make sense starts to dwindle. She had gastric bypass 5 years ago and not long after was when she started having the problem with alcohol.

So, she's acting off again tonight and I asked her if she had been drinking. She said no and I asked if she was lying (she used to lie all the time before getting arrested) and a couple more ways just to confirm. Well, it turned into an hour long fight with me apologizing and trying to get her to accept that I believed her (sometimes stress will have the same effect). She layed into me about how I never believe her. And how the past two years have been hell for her and she has another two years of driving with an ignition lock once she can finally get to the rmv to deal with it. And just a lot of going in circles and hearing things that I in no way said... 

She has left the apartment, I assume to go sit in one of our vehicles for a while, and didn't take her phone. I don't know what to do to fix this. I kind of do think she's drinking again because the change was literally the night after getting rid of the breathalyzer and off and on since. Whether there was something stressful or not. But if I even think about it she goes on the defensive and flips out at me. I do have her therapists email (she hasn't spoken to her since before the end of probation and has an appt on tuesday) but I think emailing her will just make things worse. 

I just don't k own what to do... and kind of just needed to vent because I currently have no one to talk to...",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82950497}"

I'm reaching out for some help about my Mother's alcohol use in the last few years. Ever since my Father's infidelity about two years ago, my Mom fell into a dark cycle of major depression, suicidal thoughts (mostly while intoxicated), and a chronic drinking problem. The drinking was bad throughout my whole childhood and into my young adulthood, but after my parents split it changed quickly from having one too many once in a while in a social setting to drinking until asleep 24 hours a day and days at a time. There has been countless nights of tears, suicidal claims, and injuries due to falling around the house. She has been to rehab 6 times now with no success that translates much longer than a month after leaving the facility. It has taken a great toll on my siblings and I and not only am I running out of advice and help for my younger siblings cope through this, I am also draining my finances picking up the slack after my Mom lost her job. One part of this that I think it important to note that she immigrated from Europe at a young age and has no family at all here that can help aside from us.

I guess I am reaching out for maybe an unconventional or unique way of trying to help a loved one that is going through this. We have sought out different forms of therapy, different activities/productive tasks, and groups of licensed therapists that are scheduled to come to the house specializing in alcoholism. I have spoken to past and present alcoholics on advice, been to AA meetings myself seeking some council on this, and have flown to orientations in rehabs all over the country to find a way to learn something new about helping a loved one with this disease. 

If you or anyone you know has felt hopeless before and finally found or changed that one thing, what is it? I understand sometimes it takes an alcoholic to simply decide ""enough is enough"" one day, but I'm not sure between my Mom's declining health coupled with the financial strain of addiction on myself and my family can hold on much longer to wait for that day. 

Was there a book that changed your perspective? Is there any sort approach that you wish you or a loved one would have tried earlier?

My story, plus the quitting part.","Just came here to share a quick version of my story for anyone thinking about picking up again,. or thinking about quitting. I've been hearing a lot of relapse stories lately. The Pandemic has taken a real toll.

First off, I am 3 years sober. Normally in a meeting setting, we veer away from sharing about how hard we went, or just how much we drank. So I'm only gonna do that a little..

A normal day of my drinking life looks like this:

&#x200B;

Suddenly I am awake. (notice that I didn't say, ""When I wake up..."") and it's time to start the clock again. In my particular state, booze stores don't open until 10 am. Beer at 6 am. Normally it's probably around 4/5 am when I ""get up.""

All of this to say, I have to wait until the liquor stores open up. I may have passed out and or ""saved myself some"" but it's not ""enough."" If I did have enough to comfortably cruise until 6 am, I will get at least a 12 pack, for the next few hours. But beer is expensive, and I can't keep a job. So, let's cut to the part where I walk across the street to the liquor store at 9:45 am sharp.

I can't steal, because I am in here every day, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. I cant drive to another one because I don't have a car anymore.  I don't have enough for food AND Booze.... It's always the same ruse, Ill take a pint of 100 proof, for the $4.18 please from behind the counter. I and a few other degenerates are always outside the store around 9:55. Trying to look casual and making up some bullshit to each other about why the fuck we are standing outside a liquor store this early. So, I've got the chicken, time to head home and slaughter it.

I generally take about 2 or 3 or 4 shots right out of the gate. I have to sit down because if I throw up, Im out half my net worth. (I once threw up into a cup, and was aware I would have a seizure if I didn't put the booze in me... so I drank it back down.)  If you haven't surmised as much, or aren't aware I am well into the DTs phase of drinking. Just 2 years ago, I was only drinking socially. I mean, I was drinking heavily, but in the midst of dive bars and rock and roll, I was living maaan. Anyway. So we do this until it's gone, which is usually around 2 pm.. (by ""this"" I mean, drinking a crying while watching Battlestar Galactica and relating to the characters.)  Then we do it again. And at least once more before they close, so maybe around 8:45 (they close at 9 pm) so it's a different staff, and they don't see me come in for a 3rd time today. Always a pint, sometimes a liter, but ill just drink it too fast. And this is my life, I do this day after day, and will until I am dead. Ive racked up around 20 hospital visits. Ive had seizures at work, AA meetings, Christmas, you name it. My family is scared of me, not because I am violent, but because I am 240 lbs of Chris Farley style gonna fuck up your house on accident. I've run away from and fought over 10 police/fire/paramedics before because I threw up blood all over my sister's carpet. (a few months after getting sober, I complimented her new wood floors, having no memory of why they were there..)

The list goes on and on.... and on.

So, on to the solution as I've spent enough time talking about the bullshit: If you manage to break the cycle. In my case, one of those hospital visits was enough for me to be essentially homeless. No one in my family would or could handle me. I was deeply resentful of them at the time, now eternally grateful. If you can get into sober living or have no choice, you don't need to be excited about it. But it will help. Many houses will take a person without money or a job, provided you get one immediatly. They will be pretty tough love at first, and you will understand why when you are on the other side of it.

I did Oxford House. Which is a democratically ran thing. You have a vote, you pay your fair share of equally split fees (usually like 100 a week), you get a job or volunteer, and you need to go to 2 recovery meetings per week. There is something powerful about living with people who generally are trying to come back up, know what you are going through, want to make a better life for themselves and others, and are trying to be a positive force in the community. I had a relapse after about a year. And I want to talk about the medical science of that, as if you are 'x"" bad, it will come right back. I truly didn't understand the disease model until I relapsed. It was like I never quit, seizures in a week. Here is an entire article about the phenomenon:

[https://recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-progressive-worsening-of-relapse-and-detox/](https://recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-progressive-worsening-of-relapse-and-detox/)

My life is amazing today. House, Job, I play in a killer band and make music for movies. I could write an entire book on the idea of self-actualization and the recovery process. I never thought I would make close to 6 figures, I never thought I would have a significant other who I respect, love, and feels the same. I never thought I would get happiness from helping others. This post is more about hell than the recovery. But recovery is possible. And I don't mean sobriety, but I do. I mean recovery, which is figuring out why we want to escape reality so often. I mean, I get it.. The world is a huge piece of shit. But trying to make your little corner better, makes us realize we have and can achieve a purpose. I am pressed for time, but I want to leave a few links down here for anyone coming across this and may be thinking of trying to maybe think about the possibility of maybe quitting... lol.

It's rough but worth it. You aren't alone, and you need to understand that there will never be a day where you can ""drink like a gentleman/lady."" You have to obliterate that idea. If it was a daily battle, you will lose. I will tell you that the obsession goes away if you actually practice recovery, not just abstinence.  It gets worse, never better. I needed to see that for myself, hence the relapse. I've been in recovery for 4.5 years, sober for 3 this time. I will never touch booze again. You'll have to make the choice with other substances down the line. (Medical marijuana) or whatever but I would highly recommend taking some time off from all of it. I usually have a bottle of wine at my house almost always because my girlfriend isn't an alcoholic, and I never think about it. I don't obsess, it is possible. It will be the rise of something truly great and return your self-esteem.

I did sober living for a few years, no court order but because I realized when I was there, I liked helping people. It gave me a purpose besides my selfish endeavors. There is nothing wrong with doing stuff for yourself. But not doing a thing for others was something I never really understood would generally make my life miserable, and to change it, it would give my life better quality. The ONLY way to improve our self-esteem, is to do esteemable things. Period.

I’d love to hear any similarities/differences you’ve experienced.,"I wrote a reflection on my experience at 300 days sober and I thought it may be an interesting read for you. Almost two years and I can confirm that I’m still at zero things in my life worsening with sobriety. Happy New Year.

 
300 days. 

It’s important for me to reflect on these milestones. It separates the monotony of everyday sobriety (because unfortunately, it does get tiresome). It really sucks sometimes, but it’s good most. My pseudo-mantra (barf) continues to be “I want to build the Dr. Jekyll side of me and stop feeding the Mr. Hyde.” Maybe you’re thinking about pursuing a reduction in substances, maybe not. Regardless, some tips and tricks I’ve found through many different periods of sobriety (be it one night or this fucking long haul) are as follows:

	1.	The most pressure to drink is placed on the first round. It feels lonesome and silly to miss out, but hold strong, after your party people have guzzled their inaugural beverage, the stress of drinking shoots down tenfold. Keep it up. 

	2.	Don’t set unrealistic goals for yourself. One of the best tricks I’ve learned is telling oneself “just for today.” “Just for today, I won’t drink,” “Just for today I won’t smoke,” “Just for today, the bouncer that I knew in highschool wont have to chuck me out of the bar.” This sets a much more achievable goal and reduces the imminent feeling of doom that mapping out the entirety of your life tends to have. 

	3.	You’ll lose bloat (usually after the first two weeks). No fussing on a lil extra loving but you come to realise that that extra bloat sure does make you feel groggy and a bit weak. Take a shit ton of underwear pics, baby (or don’t, whatever, it’s your body, do what you want, it literally has no impact on me whatsoever). 

	4.	Going out will still be fun, just not as much after midnight. You start to recognise why you delve into substances after having the same conversation with a pal for the fourth time that evening. Dip out free of fomo. Cherish the clear head in the morning (or the groggy one if you wake up in the middle of an REM cycle). 

	5.	You will get offered more drinks than you have in your entire life. Those people are often assholes. Proceed in those friendships with caution.

	6.	You save a ton of money. It’s not the most important thing but it does ease your wallet a bit. You may start a lottery scratchers addiction. Proceed with expenses with caution. 

	7.	You’ll more than likely lean into another vice (see: caffeine or the aforementioned lottery scratchers). Proceed with that development with caution. 

	8.	You’ll reduce your regret-income. This can get boring. Find other things to get that adrenaline rush that comes with the Sunday Scaries (movement, creation, doing something that scares you like maybe pUPPETEERING)

	9.	Be proud of the progress you’ve made. Two steps forward and one step back. You’re the only one who has lived with yourself for your entire life and you’re the only one who will continue to do so. Don’t measure your progress through anyone else. You’re not suddenly going to start living someone else’s life so quit harping on yourself by setting standards based on others successes (because you sure aren’t accounting for their failures).

	10.	Personally, I’ve had the time to recognise the difficult aspects about myself that I’ve been masking with “a good time.” This has been real fucking tough but I continue to grow. Zero things in my life have gotten worse due to being sober.

I’ve been following this sub for almost a year and I think I’ve reached a point I need to ask you guys for some help, but with this being how it is I’m probably more asking for advice.

I’ll try and keep the backstory as short as poss. Been drinking 10+ years , I guess the first escalation was 2 years ago when I was admitted to a psych ward after doing something stupid for alcohol induced psychosis. Got paired up with a local charity that helps home the homeless, as I was kicked out the night I was admitted to the ward. They helped me stop drinking, put me in touch with local services to do so, and then immediately housed me with a load of alcoholics.

I’m sure you can work out what happened next. The doctors wanted to talk to me at the local surgery afterwards as a debrief/catch up but at that time I became convinced I didn’t need their meds, I was fine. Only drinking every so often, started small- got back with my long term GF, the breakup was what triggered the whole admission thing. 

Fast forward to now, she kicked me out New Year’s Day as the drinking had just got out of hand totally. I contacted my old landlord who - as an emergency has given me a mattress on a floor in one of his flats he is doing up- just until he finds me a flat of my own and to ensure I’m not homeless again.

This leads to tonight. My girlfriend has since said she doesn’t want to break up, only live apart again like we did before moving in 8 months ago. But she wants me sober. With my current living situation, and her not wanting to see me I am finding it extremely hard not to drink. In fact so far it’s been impossible for me. Today after breaking down a little at work over it I thought I have to try something new - and I rang AA. He explained how it worked, told me I sounded like an alcoholic and that I had taken the first step , and to turn up to a meeting near me happening in a few hours - if I wanted too.

I am absolutely no good in group situations, I freeze up , get extremely anxious and I know if I was there I would just be terrified the entire time - feeling as if I was being watched etc. I walked to the meeting, walked past a few times and after seeing people outside smoking see me, I spooked - and now with extreme feelings of desperation and needing to ‘fix’ how I was feeling, went to a local shop. I havnt drank any yet. But I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I would be quitting for her, and even I know that’s not really how you do it, that it would be doomed. I feel I could work up to AA if I just had someone to walk in with me, someone who goes there to kind of mentor me, but how do you go around finding someone like that, I don’t know anyone who goes there myself. 

What can I do here ? I don’t want to spiral like I did again but the stress of keeping this relationship sweet, turning up to work everyday and trying to not drink / find help is just too much for me. I’ve contacted my local doctor but with Covid I had to fill out a form and I have to wait3 days for them to get back to me. 

I really don’t want to just- give up into the abyss here because I know it’s going to be worse this time. The more I write the more I feel .. there’s probably not a lot anyone can say here to help. It was worth a shot though.

And then there's the withdrawal. I'm nauseated and shaky and trying not to reach for hair of the dog. I know that if I'm successful I'll have migraines this week. **Tips for feeling okay-ish when you cold turkey it?**",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62815464}"

New York, consumerism, stress, happiness, and myself are to blame for my drinking. After taking a step back from my pervasive bad habit, I've had the clarity I needed to realize the answer to ""why do I feel the need to drink?""

Well the answer is complex. It's a mixture of social lubrication, stress-reduction, intimacy-induction, and cultural re-enforcement. See, for me, drinking has been something that, at first, made me feel adult. At the start of college, nearly 12 years ago, I felt that my sheltered upbringing set me apart from my clearly so-much-more-mature peers. I attended my first off-campus party on the very first night of college. There, I saw all of the faces of the other TEENAGERS that friend requested me on the ""Incoming Freshman Class of '13"" Facebook page. Everyone had a red solo cup in hand that they were refilling with a questionable liquid called ""jungle juice"" that was being stored in an oversized cooler on the floor of the bathroom. Appetizing right? I bounced around the party talking to boys whose profile pictures I thought were cute online and allowing myself to be the extroverted me I always wanted to be. This was it. ""College is my time to shine,"" I thought. In hindsight, I was wearing an outfit that bordered on costumery; a bright pink dress with outdated sequins on the hem, already making myself look like I was trying too hard. 

Later that night, I wound up in the dorm room of a lacrosse player named Mike. We didn't have sex but we probably would have if his roommate didn't burst through the door while my sequined dress was pulled up around my waist. The next morning was my first time feeling what I like to call ""hangxiety;"" or the alcohol induced anxiety you feel the days after doing something embarrassing, shameful, or something you only can vaguely remember. Campus was small so the hangxiety I felt was quadrupled by the fact that if I did something shameful, there's a good change that most of the people in the dining hall the next day would know about it. But, at the time, everyone around me was behaving just like me, so I didn't yet realize that I needed to amend my ways. Freshman year was a blur and a blast. We swapped stories the day after going out about the boys we made out with at the bar that served us underage kids, we drank green beer at 8am on St. Patrick's Day, we went off with questionable people at questionable times ""just for the story."" 

It felt like normal and expected college activities until one day, after taking more shots than I can count and dancing on desks in my friend's dorm, I ended up in the back of an ambulance. My boyfriend at the time rode with me to the hospital as they stuck me on a bed in a hallway to sleep if off. Luckily, I didn't need to get my stomach pumped or anything. It was just a really expensive way to sober up. My family of course found out about it and the shame that I associated myself with was all consuming. I felt judged, and rightfully so. However, the influence that is freshman year overpowered the shame, and pretty soon I was binge drinking again. 

I didn't end up back in the hospital for another year after that. My second trip to the hospital happened after drinking too much at my friend's apartment. She was the type of friend that's like the ""mom"" of the group. She'd always tout her maturity around like a badge, in an almost ""holy than thou"" manner. It drove me nuts, but it was also a bit essential for me to have that kind of influence around me. I needed someone who could step up if things went wrong. She's the one who called 911 when I threw up in her bedroom and then passed out. I woke up to my mom sitting next to me, looking at me with so much disgust that it pains me to even try to remember it. 

From then on, I viewed my drinking habits like a challenge. I constantly asked myself how everyone else could drink more responsibly than I could. How did I always feel like the most guilty, drunkest, and dumbest one in the room at any social gathering? What was everyone else's secret? I just assumed everyone was more confident, intelligent, and interesting than I was and didn't need alcohol as much as I did to make it in a social setting. I envied everyone's ability to hold it together and act so adult. I figured drinking alcohol was something I just needed to master. I just needed to learn how to only have a couple glasses of wine while talking about grown-up things and making a good impression and *then* I'd be a real grown up. Everyone else had figured it out, so I thought I just needed to do the same. But, that proved to be more difficult than I thought and the position that drinking had put me in eventually drove me to throw my legs out of a 5th floor window and pray that the ground below would absolve me from it all. However, a kind soul, my guardian angel in the form of a girl from down the hall I barely knew pulled me back by the waist. 

After that moment, I knew I could no longer exist at this particular college. I needed a fresh start. So I transferred to a new university - one that was actually academically superior to my first college and for the first time in two years, I felt like I had a shot at a bright future. The pride I felt after getting into this prestigious new school gave me the confidence I needed to feel like I had the capability of pulling my life together. And that's exactly what I did. The next two years of college felt more balanced. I was still drinking, but much less. I was studying and challenging myself and planning for my post-grad life. The continued shame I felt from my freshman/sophomore year antics was the fire under my tuchus that told me I needed to prove to my friends and family that I wasn't the messy screw-up I truly believed myself to be. I pushed myself *for them.* I studied for the LSAT to prove myself *to them*. I said I was going to live a big fancy life and work in a top law firm just to to try and distract *them* from the fact that I once fell off my top bunk drunk. Simultaneously, I suppose I was trying to prove myself of something, too. I so desperately wanted to feel like I could have a healthy life while having a healthy relationship with alcohol. When I missed my LSAT because I forgot to set my alarm, I felt these lies crumble around me. My first thought wasn't ""oh my God, now I have less of a chance of getting into a good law school,"" it was ""what is everyone going to think of me after being dumb enough to sleep through my LSAT?"" This massive flub wasn't caused by alcohol, luckily. I didn't miss the LSAT because I was hungover. But I probably missed the LSAT because deep down within, I knew I didn't really want to go to law school, I was just doing it to prove a point. 

In the end, I never went to law school, but I did move to New York City after college to  try to find myself some kind of enviable life that would finally absolve me. Ironically, at first, I wound up living on the couch of the girl who called the ambulance for me all those years ago. She lived in Queens with the boyfriend she'd been dating for several years at that point. She had a job at the New York Times and drank tea out of big, ceramic mugs, and lit candles in her living room. She was a grown up and all I wanted was to have that life. On the weekends we'd take trips to TJ Maxx and have lunch together and I felt like in those moments, my life was alright. But about three weeks into my stay with her, I went out to happy hour in Manhattan with another friend and ended up putting myself in a questionable situation. My friend wanted to head home for the evening, but I wasn't ready to call it a night so I went to a bar next door, sat down, and ordered a glass of ""Sauvignon Blanc"" - a type of wine I just learned how to pronounce so ordering it made me feel urbanite and sophisticated. After ordering, I got up to use to bathroom. When I came back, there was a man sitting in the seat next to me who seemed fairly friendly. We chatted for a bit while I finished up my night cap glass of wine. But when I went to stand up, I felt far more drunk than I should have. In the year since that, I always wondered what that man might have slipped in my drink. Or did I really just lose track of the number of glasses of wine I had? I called the friend I was staying with and she said I just needed to hail a cap and head home, which I did. I showed up at her front door an hour later and nearly incapacitated. In that moment, all the shame I had been running for years caught up with me. I'd been trying to prove something that may just not be true after all. Maybe I really didn't have my life together. Maybe this particular friend saw me for who I really was - a drunk screw up. The next morning her and I commuted to work together, but about halfway through our ride on the bouncy LIRR, I threw up. Then I threw up again in Penn Station. Then a kind stranger, another guardian angel, picked me up and walked with me to the nearest public bathroom while I cleaned myself up. She waited with me while I called my job and said I couldn't make it in. She walked me back to Penn Station and saw me off as I took to LIRR right back to Queens to sleep off the shame and the nausea. 

A week later I moved off my friend's couch and into my own apartment not far away. The structure of having my own space and pride I felt by not living on someone's couch helped me be a bit more responsible. I stopped putting myself in as many dangerous situations, but definitely didn't stop altogether. I was still being reckless, but in the kind of way that is expected for a young adult in New York City. I enjoyed happy hours and wine and sitting at bars after work, soaking up all of the cosmopolitan, Sex-and-the-City vibes as I could. Soon enough, I found a new job, a better job with impressive benefits and a salary that allowed me to move to Manhattan. This new job even had a bar inside the office and held a weekly, free happy hour for its employees on Thursdays. My fellow coworkers were mostly in their early 20s like I was at the time and those complimentary happy hours usually ended up with afterhours beer pong in the breakroom and subsequent trips to nearby bars to keep the fun going. For the two years I spent at that company, I can't think of a single Friday where I wasn't hungover. 

From this job, I went on to one on Wall Street. My professional success was like a band-aid on this continued shame I'd been running from. I may not have had a lasting romantic relationship at this point in my life, but at least I had my job and my salary and the status that afforded me. Soon after that, my close friends started settling down. I was left out of wedding parties. One friend even told me that even though we had been friends for 20 years, she considered me to be a bridesmaid but in the end wanted to have a bridal party consisting of girls who were at ""her stage of life"" - meaning she preferred to have the girls in her party to be in serious relationships, thinking about settling down and not ones who were stumbling home at 2am. Maybe that was a jerky thing to say to me, but it might have had some truth to it. The girls in her bridal party had cars to get to bridal appointments with and boyfriends/husbands to do double-dates with. But I was still a car-less Manhattanite who needed to rely on too many people and public transportation to make it to any dress fittings. 

At this point is when I started to feel my life slipping away from me. I had adopted this ""sophisticated"" city persona as a dire attempt to get respect from others, and more importantly start respecting myself. However, it was coming up futile. I longed for stability and love and companionship. I started to grow tired of the late nights and the hangovers and the endless bragging about how ""busy"" we all were like that was some kind of thing to be proud of. So I left. I moved out of the city and back to my hometown in a last ditch effort to find the happiness that had been eluding me. I felt it working almost right away. By giving up the things I taught myself to like, I felt more at peace. I allowed myself to indulge in the things that previously would have been a blemish on my social status; like learning how to cook, getting a cat, and staying in all weekend. But one thing I had not yet escaped form was alcohol.

 Alcohol simultaneously makes me feel immature and adult, so my relationship with it was complicated. I started to brag about having not had liquor in years and that I exclusively drink wine now. It felt more mature to sip ""Savvy B"" out of a stemless glass than downing shots of cheap vodka. It was not only socially accepted, but socially expected to do so. But for me, wine has been the main event of any dinner out or evening in. It's been what's given me the confidence and ease to enjoy someone else's company...and my own. I've feared the situations that may not have wine present. And God forbid I go on a date, let alone be intimate, without it! 

Not long after my move out of NYC, I found myself in a seemingly serious relationship with a seemingly good man. My life felt on track, finally. I was able to talk to my friends who settled down and feel like I had their genuine respect. But what lurked beneath the surface was the sad truth that our relationship was entirely sponsored by ""Josh Chardonnay."" No movie night was complete without at least two bottles of it. I'd often supply the wine if I was staying at his place. I'd bring in two bottles of wine, but keep one in my car in case we ran out and didn't want to seem overeager by bringing in all three bottles at once. We started accessing that third bottle more often than not, so I just started bringing it in with me the first time around. The thing is, though, that during this period of my life, I didn't feel like I was drinking too much. I wasn't dancing on desks anymore or making out with strangers or saying something I completely regretted. I felt like I was doing exactly what I set out to do in the first place: mastering drinking. I felt pride for being able to not act foolish after drinking, so I justified it. No longer was anyone pulling me aside and commenting on my behavior. I was succeeding in the art of concealment and denial. 

Eventually, this relationship ended upon discovering the depth of his mental illness, which was likely a reason for his drinking, too. I landed in the dating pool once again, but this time I was no longer single in NYC where drinking is such a pervasive part of the culture. In my new town, you had to drive to get to a date, so no more than two drinks was ever really consumed. I had to dig deep for things to say on a date and this terrified me. I had to confront the fact that I don't find myself to be all that interesting since I couldn't hid behind the blur of wine after your third glass of it. And all of this happened in 2020. I was going through a breakup, confronting my drinking habits, and going through a pandemic, alone in a house I just bought by myself right before the first wave of COVID. 

The first few months were a living hell. I went on some of the worst dates in my life and felt in over my head in more ways than one. My last moment of shame came the day of a football game that I watched at my Uncle's party. It happened to be the same day as my friend's virtual gender reveal party. I'm not sure if the impending feeling of having to confront the fact that my life choices landed me single in my late late 20s while watching my friend learn the sex of her baby caused me to drink more than usual that day or what, but for whatever reason, I was tipsy enough to decide to pop a bottle of champagne just to have one more drink after the party ended. My mom came up to me and sniffed my glass and turned red, flinging accusations of a drinking problem around. I denied heavily, leaning on the excuse that I wasn't drinking as much these days and I just wanted to toast my friend's good news that she's having a baby boy. Since that day, I'd been more cautious of how much I drink in front of my family. And since my family is mostly the only people I have seen during this pandemic, it's made me cut back significantly, almost to the point of cutting it out altogether. 

In the midst of this reckoning, I met someone who is very much NOT a big drinker. For a long time, I felt like it would be impossible for me to have a relationship with someone who didn't want to get a good buzz on to watch a movie, but I've been proven wrong. Luckily, my reckoning began before I met him and not because of him. His influence has been a positive light in my life and one that doesn't feel like a band-aid on this shame I have been running from, but a genuinely good thing that I have been blessed with. My breakup with alcohol is in its beginning stages.

 It still terrifies me to think of what my life will look like without it. Alcohol whispers in my ear at night ""what if this relationship fails and you have to date again, but sober. Who will want to date you then?"" I have to remind myself it's just the alcohol talking. Alcohol and I have been in an abusive relationship for 12 years. It's manipulated me into thinking I can't live without it, no one will want me like alcohol does, and that life can't be fun without it. I am starting to learn to forgive myself for the shame I've felt and to work through it. I can't blame myself entirely for the shame, either. It's not completely my fault that I fell victim to alcohol. Alcohol was pushed on me (and women in general) as being a symbol of freedom, independence and strength by way of the media. Ads, TV, movies, books, etc. have taught us that keeping up with the boys on a night out makes us look cool and desirable. Drinking a whiskey neat makes us look like the ultimate gotta-have-her girl. But, in reality, it just bound me to shame that kept me drinking, but for other reasons. 

Breaking free of this way of thinking is extremely difficult as I navigate who in my life I might be able to lean on while I do so. I may lose friends who see me only as a good time. I don't necessarily want to push my boyfriend away by disclosing too much of my history with alcohol to him too quickly. I understand that alcoholics are not encouraged to have romantic relationships during their first year of sobriety, but I hesitate to turn away such an inherently good human being from my life. I hope this post does not get turned into some kind of public ask from permission to continuing keeping him in my life. This post is bigger than that and is an admission of vulnerability so I hope you can all be kind.

My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. There was a time a few years ago (like 8-10 years) that he stopped drinking for about a year then started back again. This past year (2020) I was in Canada due to COVID and I got married. During this time my dad had started drinking very heavily, to the point he had gotten suicidal tendencies/thoughts. About 2 weeks ago, before I flew back home my dad had broken down on the phone wanting to quit drinking and needed help. I am my dads only child and we are super close so I want to help him the best I can. 

Fast-forward to now.. 

I live with my dad, so I know what goes on. My dad claims to of slacked up on drinking (maybe 3-6 beers a day). Though that still isn't as much as before he is constantly wanting more. All of his friends drink and offer him beer. And it has now gotten to the point that he will leave the house to go drink since we argue about him drinking.. Some of my major issues with this is him drinking and driving, him mixing his medicine and alcohol, and the shear fact that he is just consuming so much alcohol. 

I'm kind of at a loss for words at this point, I am unsure what to do. I have sat him down and talked to him, and it seems to turn into a passive argument of him saying ""Oh I am wrong, always in the wrong, I can't do shit right"" or him completely changing the topic.

My sponsor and I connected early on in my AA meeting journey and seem to have a similar mindset. When we chat, his words really connect with me and I respect his point of view. 

The problem is, when I first asked him to be my sponsor, he said I have to call him every day at 6:00pm and I have to work the steps. 

Now he picks up 3/7 times I call him. He keeps telling me to set aside an hour tomorrow to go over chapters of BB/steps. It never happens. He just doesn’t pick up the phone when I call him to go over these subjects in depth. 

I know he’s a busy guy and I don’t want to get a new sponsor (honestly, I dont know many people in my location and he’s the only person I would consider to sponsor me) 

I need to note, he was gracious enough to take me on as a sponsee before I was completely sober. With his help, I’ve been able to string together some stints but still keep slipping (never had more then 1 beer before going right back on the wagon) Yes, I haven’t been the easiest sponsee but I’ve been dedicated to the work but I can’t seem to get ahold of him long enough to get guidance through the work. 

I’ve told him if he’s not up for taking on a sponsee like myself or if he’s just overwhelmed just let me know and I can start the search for a new permanent sponsor and will always appreciate his help and will reach out if I need his advice. He says it’s not a problem and we move on. 

I’m Not sure what to do from here. I want him to be my sponsor but I don’t feel like I have so
Done that I can rely on. Any advice?

7pm: Tried to drink just a couple of whiskeys and did well. Not complete black out drunk which is an improvement. 9pm: I smoked two cigarettes and after this Bacardi I’m going to bed. Feels like a victory. 10:30pm: fucked it once again but not to the extent I normally would have so that’s good. 12pm: Scratch that. Got fucked as usual. First day of the new year and I blew it big time. 
 
2nd January 6:30am. Off to work. Last night I Drank half a 70cl of Club Haig and about the same from a Grants Scotch Whiskey 70cl which I might add was fucking gross. Also 3 doubles of Grey Goose and Gordon’s pink gin. All straight.  

Jan 3rd : As an aside reading this back, the emphasis on the first day of the new year means fuck all. The day I stop drinking to reach my desired state of blackout is the first day of a new year anyway. A new year without it. I feel like a fraud if I’m honest. I don’t need to drink everyday and there is times where I’ll go 2-3 weeks without drinking. I read people’s problems with drink and they are far worse than mine to the point  that I feel like a cry baby. I’m also well aware that everyone is different and our problems are neither more or less than anyone else’s because they are unique to us. They are ours to own. I feel like a walking contradiction most of the time, I preach clean living to myself for a few weeks then become the epitome of a drunken waster. I go from a chickpea eating Dali Lama to a debauched red meat devouring Oliver Reed in a matter of minutes. I go from a non smoker to smoking an ounce of tobacco in a matter of minutes, a non drinker to drinking a litre of whiskey in a matter of minutes. I go from eating no sugar to eating a kilo of Cadbury’s in a matter of minutes. And it’s all because of booze. And me. Booze and me. Tied to each other like Bill and Ted. I just want to be free and I know I’m the one with the choice. The booze has no choice, it will always be booze, it’s sole purpose in its life is to be drank. I have a choice, I choose to drink or not. I’m getting better at it but not better enough. I’ll be honest about the one thing I do love. I fucking love being drunk. LOVE IT. I don’t love everything else about it. The uncertainty of what or who I become, the late nights, the struggle to get to work, the embarrassment that I feel with the fear of the unknown. Luckily I now mostly drink alone at home so I haven’t got the fear of the unknown that I used to have. I still bring up to myself the times I went off the rails on nights out or at festivals etc It was a good time, it felt like a good time, my friends tell me it was good times but I can sense that the reputation of me turned them off. That’s probably paranoid and as a wise man said once, people don’t think of it as much as you think about it yourself. That’s telling to me though. It tells me I’m unhappy, unhappy that I can’t put my finger on when this or that happened.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63967144}"

Legally are we as a family still powerless?,"TLDR: 70 year old mother's physical and mental health are deteriorating significantly but she is still refusing help or to even see a doctor. On what grounds can she be involuntarily assessed by a medical professional?

My mother (70) has been heavily drinking (a few litres of vodka a week) and hiding alcohol for as long as I (32 F) can remember. Her health has been deteriorating rapidly for many years and she is causing me and my siblings great worry.
She has not been to a doctor or medical professional in over a decade and either refuses to go or agrees to go when I make the appointment but then refuses on the day of the appointment!

My mother has lost a lot of weight and is now ""skin and bones"". All the symptoms I am about to list are the ones that are apparent even when she is sober.

My mother shows signs of (what we presume to be) some form of neurologic condition as she has a constant shake in her head and hands and has little control over one eyelid. Her co-ordination is terrible and she cannot walk in a straight line - she staggers around with her legs slightly bent as though her legs are just about carrying her.

She is capable of looking after herself, (eg, get herself dressed, manage to scrape together a dinner when she decides to eat) and her long term memory is good but is often confused or behind in conversations and on a daily basis asks me the same questions repeatedly. On a bad day it could be as little as 10 minutes and she is repeating herself again.
 
She has a lot of unexplained scrapes and bruises on her arms and other parts of her body (when we get a glimpse of it). Her legs and feet are swollen which she keeps covered with socks and won't let us see but anytime a sock has slipped we have seen red, flaky, broken skin underneath and the same skin is on her hands (she often covers them by wearing gloves). I have also noticed blood on her socks before where she has cuts or abrasions on her legs that have bled.
She regularly soils and wets herself also and either doesn't notice, doesn't care or denies it.

My questions are:
-There have been failed interventions with family in the past but is there a point where a medical professional can step in? Are we still helpless as a family?
-I am worried about how much worse she can get health wise. Has anyone or someone they know experienced these health problems and if so what is the next stage of my mothers deterioration?

I’m a 29 y/o female in fairly good health aside from my drinking (I usually consume about a 6-pack of fairly low-ABV beer a night - think Hamm’s or PBR - and have done so for years, will sometimes have more or a heavier beer on weekends). My fiancé and I have opted to stop drinking for New Years - at least for 60 days but in my case it should probably be indefinite/ultimate goal should be not to drink again. This was supposed to go into effect yesterday after a hair of the dog New Year’s Day (i.e. one last 6-pack). 

I woke up yesterday and didn’t feel terrible - just a bit light-headed and on edge. Around 5 PM I started to scare myself thinking about withdrawal horror stories/seizures/etc. and my heart rate shot up. I ran down to the store and bought two low-ABV beers, drank them by 7 PM (which means they “wore off” long before I went to bed), and felt fine for the rest of the night (except the insomnia which, while I expected it, still sucked). This means it’s now been about 20 hours since my last drink and I feel totally unremarkable - not great, but nowhere near as anxious as yesterday, no shakes/normal heart rate/etc. I’ve read often that physical withdrawal symptoms peak around 72 hours in/that this is the time when the threat of a seizure is greatest. Is a seizure something I need to be concerned about in the next couple of days given the level of consumption I was at, or am I just letting my anxiety get the best of me? Should I continue to have a beer for the next couple nights as a short taper or is the desire to do so just my alcoholic brain trying to get me to keep drinking?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44718933}"

After becoming 18 years old and being able to purchase alcohol, I started drinking every time I would meet up with friends. I always drink a lot more than my friends when at a pub or club and I often get so drunk that I blackout. This would happen around 2 times a week for a few years.
Fast forwarding to now, I’m 22 and recently my mum passed away. This caused me even more depression and anxiety, meaning I drink more and more. I have also had clonazepam and diazepam prescribed to me for panic disorder. I am in a cycle in which I get black out drunk, and then take the benzos in the morning for the anxiety of hangovers. What I have realised is that I drink whenever I feel down, whenever I feel anxious and in pretty much every social gathering.

Not because I was overwhelmed, or overly emotional or even hungover. But because I have developed a pattern that I don’t see a way out of. . Not just from alcohol and drugs but from what life has become. I don’t see a way around the mess I have created for myself or that of the current times we are living in.

Now, I can see only my problem, addiction. It’s taken all that I love away from me. My emotions. My light. My love of life.  Replaced with anxiety, fear, guilt, loss & comparing myself to others who do not understand my battles. Creating additional problems where there were none. In real life, in relationships and in my brain. I have deteriorated my own self worth for the temporary pleasures of these poisons.

I know what to do but I am not strong. I have fallen so far from myself I can’t see me anymore. I’m not happy with what I’ve done with my life. I’m not happy about where I’m at.

The worst words to hear - they know now.

It started off as something small - just a bottle of gin when she wanted a bath. And if she drank the whole bottle, it was because she had to use the tonic. She had to use the fruit she bought, really it was a fight against food waste. It was never because she needed the drink, to forget even momentarily about her awful life.

Slowly it snowballed, little lie after little lie. The lies became worse - because lies are desperate to hide their sad truth. Soon, it wasn't gin but straight vodka that she would order daily, all to replenish her stock. All under the excuse that she needed it to survive, to deal with the awful thoughts running rampant in her mimd. She told herself it was for the better, lying even to herself.

But they know now.

The more she lied the easier it became; she could hide the bottles under the sofa and pretend they didn't exist. She could drink a whole bottle, and think it was healthier than her other crutches. She could tell her friends it was just a casual drink - and wanting to believe they blindly followed her suit.

The drink quieted her emotions, made her brain slow. But they didn't stop the awful things she had learnt from taking root, and creeping their way across her brain like a gross poison ivy. Tendrils stretched and blossomed in her muted thoughts, spreading their ilk in to every memory, every independent thought.

They know now.

She slept, and they got in. Found the empty bottles, no longer hidden. Her house, her habit, but they were her best friends. Relief, initially - because the little lies had become bigger and bigger. Now she felt mostly sadness, because the lies spoke her awful truth. She had often questioned how long she could keep lying, but had never answered that sick question in her head. They were her best friends, how long would they stick around for? 

Open ended, like her addiction, a question never to be answered. Only a sadness to be assumed, to be taken on and accepted.

Still, they know now.

Never forget. Those words speak to her. Never can she forget the awful things done to her - by her best friend, her godbrother, her lover, her mother. People who looked at her, and saw vulnerability. The drink can help, so she doesn't think about it each night when her mind goes worryingly quiet. When the impostors stand in, and whisper sweet nothings to the darker part of her mind.

It cries out at her, from the pitch black. She hears the whispers, she can't simply forget-me-not. They tell her to do things, things she wishes she could leave behind. But once you've brought them in to your mind, forever they stay. Their ink darkness taints every thought you could have, and quickly overwhelm before you can make any sense of what to say.

Still she bears them, these insidious thoughts, determined to grow. She will not be beaten, and thrive she will. Slowly but surely, a light at the end of the tunnel. Notes around the house, reminding her why she's still around. Even through the alcohol fog, easy concepts to remember. To live on, to love on. But still, they know. And they will never trust again.

They know now.

The words she has spoken before will forever fall on deaf ears. The excuses, the lies, the insipid manipulation. Now just an alcoholic, no longer a person. Every comment will be met with grey-tinted glasses. 

The curse of an alcoholic - more lies than truth. Such a dirty disease, and one that only those that have lived through it will ever understand. Those around are constantly hurt, but the alcohol makes that fact easy to forget.

Still, she thinks, now they know. Only up from here, where else can she go?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6296699}"

I never drank til my 1 at year in college. Even then, I was very hesitant. After I started drinking, it became a way to connect, socialize, deal with everything . I ended up getting into a really abusive relationship when I was 21 and that made me spiral. I started using drinking as a form of coping and that’s when this whole problem started. I don’t drink daily but I’ve been binge drinking every weekend for about 8 years now. I know that all this has health repercussion but I just don’t know how to stop. I will go days without drinking and when presented with the situation, I convince myself that I can moderate but it never ends up that way. It has gotten to the point that whenever I do drink, I go through a bout of depression and self hatred. I’m tired of feeling this way. I’m scared I’m killing myself. I never met my dad but the little I know of him is that he was an alcoholic which is why my mom left him. I don’t want to end up on the same path.  I have a very supportive partner but I don’t want to keep putting him through all of it. Can anybody give me tips on how to start my sober journey? Any advise is appreciated!

I started drinking around 20 (I’m 27 now). Just casual beers with family and friends, nothing crazy. Around 23 I started drinking alone, and increasing my intake. Eventually I reached a point where I either drank to get hammered, or not at all. I just couldn’t moderate. There’s no such thing as “1 beer”, I’ve learned that this past year. Before I would sneak drinks, use a credit card my wife couldn’t see, drink and drive, etc. it just got worse and worse. 

I put my wife through hell. November of 2019 I went to see some friends play a concert, which meant free alcohol. I promised my wife I wouldn’t get drunk. At the end of the night they had to carry me out of the venue. I don’t remember this, but on the highway home I tried to kill myself by jumping out of the car. I woke up in the hospital and the doctor said I almost died of alcohol poising. My wife stuck by me, she knew I was sick (I’m also bipolar). When I got out of the hospital I lost my job, but that’s another story. I started going to intensive outpatient programs. 

On January 1st I was playing a show with a new band. I was so terrified I thought “okay just a few drinks will take the edge off, I haven’t drank in a month so I got this!”  Wrong. 

When my wife came home to my drunk ass she said “I can’t do this anymore!” While balling her eyes out. We had only been married for 6 months and I was losing my wife. I will never forget that face. I was destroying her. She stuck by my side and I knew then, that I will NEVER put her through something like that again. With the help of therapy and medication I am now a year sober. I am so proud of myself. My wife is pregnant with our first and our daughter won’t have a dad that’s a mess. It’s a miracle I’m alive and I worked so hard to get here. Happy new year everyone! I’m NOT drinking in 2021!

On average he consumes 14 bottles of wine a week, this is sometimes accompanied with a few shorts on a Friday n Saturday night. He is starting to look a mess, bloodshot eyes and he stinks of stale booze. Very rarely has a hangover and he had also started hiding empty bottles! I can’t talk to him as in his eyes he doesn’t have a problem as he enjoys his drinking and cigar smoking. His diet is terrible too. I make healthy meals but he has one or two takeaways a week.

So here's to a new year and a new life on the wagon. Congrats to all of the rest of you who made it through another holiday season sober. I can't say I'm sober cos I still smoke weed, but for me, just being off the sauce makes me feel so much better.

It really does feel better, tbh. I hope I inspire someone too, but I'm nobody's hero. Just trying not to kill some drunk kids tonight cos I'm the only one not white girl wasted except my GF and my kid brother's got a bunch of 12-18 year old boys over with a gigantic noisebox playing fucknoise.
