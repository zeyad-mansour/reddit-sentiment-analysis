I have put myself in harms way time after time and yet I continue to make the same mistakes. I don’t drink daily but I binge drink in social settings. I never intend on getting drunk but once I start I just can’t stop. It’s like I completely forget and can’t remind myself to stop. My family never knew I had this issue until recently. They’re really worried and I just feel like shit. I never thought this is how my life would go. I always thought “oh well it was just a slip up.” It has come to a point where its become a pattern. I clearly can’t control myself when I have a drink. Last night I passed out in the bathroom at a concert. Woke up just wanting the ground to swallow me. The depression just kicks in and I feel like dying. I don’t want to go through this again. I’m going to make my attempt at quitting for good. I hope I can change my life around.,14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990301251411438}"

2022-01-30 07:59:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/sg8o1g/advice_on_how_to_support_my_fiancé/,Advice on how to support my fiancé?,"Me (26F) and my fiancé (27M) have been together since we were in school (ages 18 and 19). We have pretty much grown up together, school sweethearts, blah blah blah. We own a house together and recently got engaged in May 2021. Lots of fun and exciting life events happening at the moment, and things are pretty good. 

However, I am starting to notice that alcohol may be starting to become an issue for my fiancé. For background, both his parents are alcoholics and have a strained relationship with drink. My fiancé doesn’t drink that regularly but it seems to be very linked with social situations. He won’t drink much during the week (maybe one or two beers in total) and he will often have a couple on the weekend. However, if we go to a pub, to a friends place, or have people over to ours, he will drink to excess. Easily 8-10 pints of beer (24-30 units).  

When he drinks this amount, his personality changes and generally not that fun to be around. He is not physically or emotionally abusive in any way, but his behaviour changes, if that makes sense? He is more erratic and his ability to behave in a restrained manner is impaired. He will spill his drink all down him and all over the table/floor, and generally embarrasses himself. He will wake up the next morning and not remember parts of the evening behind a certain point. Meanwhile, the rest of our friends are only drinking a maximum of 3-4 pints and just having a good time. My fiancé does have a higher tolerance to alcohol than some so it takes him a few extra drinks to feel drunk. 

Me on the otherhand, I don’t drink unless it is a special occasion. Even then I will have a maximum of two drinks, and I don’t even enjoy it. I’m happy being designated driver, and don’t have a problem being around people drinking as long as it’s civilised. 

A few days ago we had one of our very close friends (27M) over for dinner and a chat. He’s just come back from a long trip and we were looking forward to catching up. We ate and they shared a few drinks between them, but my fiancé kept drinking. I lost count of how many beers he had in the end but it was easily 8+ of very strong (6% ABV) cans. It was coming to the end of the evening and we were sat at the breakfast bar in the kitchen. He thought it would be funny to grab onto my feet and tickle me whilst sat on a bar stool. Initially it was funny but when I told him to stop as I was sliding off my seat, he didn’t and I slipped and fell to my knees on the hard floor. I got some pretty funky bruises. Instead of helping me up he just chuckled and told me to get up. Our friend was very taken aback and said he would make his exit as he felt uncomfortable. He helped me up and then went on his way. 

We went to bed and I when I spoke to his later the following evening after I got home from work, he said he couldn’t remember any of what happened. He was very upset and I know he would never have done it on purpose. We spoke about how I felt about the situation and whether he thought it was an issue. He said it was becoming increasingly hard for him to only have a few drinks and then stop, like there is no off switch. He mentioned feels miserable and depressed at the moment due to work and is worried that it’s becoming a coping mechanism. He doesn’t want to become like his parents. 

He had been trying to better himself recently, eating healthier, going to the gym, limiting himself to a few drinks a week. Then it’s like he’s lost the off switch. Our friend has also spoken to him about his concerns and is worried about him. 

I guess my question is, what can I do to support him? He says he wants to reduce his drinking, or stop altogether. It’s tricky for me as alcohol is not something I enjoy so I’m finding it very hard to understand how he is feeling. Any advice is appreciated.

And just to be clear:  No, I will not consider AA or rehab, so I won’t even read your response if it starts that way.

A little background:  Been a daily drinker for almost 10 years (ages: 24-34).  Started as a few drinks a night daily drinker to now around a pint to pint and a half of vodka a day drinker.  I have never had the shakes and always spread my drinks out to avoid a hangover.  I also don’t enjoy being drunk, so I avoid it.  I just enjoy the buzz stimulation I get (almost like motivation). 

Well, I’ve realized that my tolerance has increased so much that alarm bells are going off.  I also don’t really enjoy drinking anymore.  It feels more like a crutch than it is an enjoyable past time.  I told my wife I think I have a drinking problem.  She was super supportive, and now I am looking at either the tapering route or the cold turkey route.  

Luckily, I have Xanax and Propranolol to help with withdrawal symptoms.  If you know of any other medications/supplements, please let me know.

My POV for tapering:  It will reduce the possibility of DT’s and seizures but it’s a slower process.  

My POV for cold turkey:  It will be quicker but increase the risk for DT’s and seizures.  I’ve never even had the shakes but I don’t know if that’s an indicator of anything.

I had been drinking for 40 years, the last 10 quite heavily (i.e., 2-5 bottles of wine a night). 

Like many of us, I was hiding most of the drinking and terrified of stopping due to all of the horror stories surrounding AWS. Inpatient detox and rehab were off the table due to $$, but I found an outpatient clinic that required an intake appt, 5 - 15 min daily check-ins and provided a round of benzos (Librium or Valium) all for about $500. You could probably also do this with a sympathetic MD.

So, I got all ready. Bought a blood pressure cuff and a pulse/oxygen meter at the drug store. Told my wife I’d been drinking too much and was stopping and asked her to “keep tabs on me” For a few days. But I didn’t mention all of the possible horror stories. She was thrilled.

ZERO HOUR: three bottles of my finest wines remaining. Gave the rest of my collection to a friend.

Day 1 (12 hours past zero hour): Visited clinic and began with 2 Libriums 6x a day. Vitals fine. No noticeable effects other than I really, really wanted to drink. Didn’t sleep much at night

Day 2: lowered to two libriums 4x a day. Vitals fine. Slept most of the day, drank Gatorade and ate some Chinese food. Didn’t sleep much at night. Wanted to drink.

Day 3: stayed on two libriums 4x a day. Vitals fine. Still pretty sleepy. Only real symptoms were itching. Easier to sleep at night. Wanted to drink

Day 4: Two libriums 2x a day. Low energy, but otherwise ok. Thought more about lack of AWS than not drinking

Day 5: 1 librium 2x a day. Felt fine. Wanted alcohol.

Day 6: 1 librium. Dr dismissed me with instructions to keep taking my vitals and pop the two remaining librium at the first sign of anything going south.

Done with the “easy part” -> now onto the more difficult journey.

THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE. AWS is probably different for everybody, and I am not here to make light of AWS and related symptoms or outcomes. Rather, I’m simply suggesting that you shouldn’t let the fear of AWS keep you from stopping. Perhaps I got lucky in the gene line, but I’ve had “colds” that were much more annoying and disrupting.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9879136681556702}"

She did it because he lost his job due to drinking and almost died from it. He told her he quit and she constantly found him drinking secretly.
His first night with us he was wasted. We never said he had to be sober but said we would like him to try to be. He never drank in front of us but we could tell he was always drunk. 
We use to drink every single night and stopped before he came to us so there wasn't any temptation. 
A few months go by and he is still jobless, stays at the house everyday, all day but swears he is sober and constantly getting interviews. 
I had a REALLY bad week at work and warned him that I would be drinking but would hide in my room. Came home to a bottle of vodka and wine on the counter. Vodka for me, wine for the guys. Ok? The next day there was a bottle of whiskey and most the vodka gone. It quickly became normal for all of us to drink openly together.  A couple of weeks later we tell him we are going back to not drinking and he should too after I saw him get a cup of just vodka at 6am. ""Tomato less bloody mary"" he told me.
He didn't drink for 1 whole day and his body went into shock. He was throwing up hard all day and when he went to drive to the store he had a seizure and was hospitalized for a week. 
When he came out we said rehab or we kick him out. 
Amazingly he went to rehab for 5 weeks, came back and was a quiet/stoic man for a little while. Took his meds, went to his daily AA meetings and seemed to be doing well.
Until recently.  He's back to being obviously drunk again while bragging about how amazing he is at AA and how they made him a lead. We didn't have proof until we started to watch the camera in our living room (that he was aware of!). 
We saw him leave the house, come back with a brown bag and go straight to his room. Then came out with an empty bottle of vodka and took it out to the recycling.  My husband went out there, grabbed the bottle and confronted him, leaving out the part where we saw him from the camera. He denied it and said he was cleaning and found it which was a lie. We said we weren't going to kick him out but he needed to get his shit together.
Since then we have seen him do the same thing 4 more times. Bring a brown bag straight to his room, bring out a now wrapped up bottle and take it to his car instead. (We checked the recycling/garbage and it doesn't exist) We know he is still drinking and know he is being extra sneaky about it. Just don't know how to approach him about it. 
""Hey we started watching you through the camera you know about and aren't dumb?""
Losing his job, wife, house and almost dying twice has not stopped him. Rehab, therapy, AA and us confronting him did nothing since he just lies about it. 
Do we just act like we don't know, continue on with our lives and pray his moves out soon? Have an intervention?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960790276527405}"

My mother (43) has been struggling with addiction for as long as I (23) can remember. She has progressively gotten worse over the years. About 5 years ago is when she first attempted to try to get sober. It has been a vicious cycle since then. About twice a year now she tries to detox at home, for about a week then gets to the point of hallucinations and I finally convince her to go to the ER. She stays in the hospital just long enough to comfortably get all the alcohol out of her system, but never goes to rehab. She stays sober for a bit but then eventually relapses. Each period of sobriety gets shorter and shorter, with the most recent time being just long enough for her to get home. 

Now, fast forward to the current problem. For the last two weeks my mom has done nothing but slept. She hasn’t had a single thing to eat in two weeks, at this point i dont know how she is alive. She sleeps all day and all night. She gets up a few times during the day to smoke a cigarette and drink, then back to sleep. She has been extremely angry and I cant do anything around the house without her yelling because im making too much noise (even just refilling a water bottle). She refuses to go to the hospital to get help.

I've decided to cut down and in fact have only had three sessions of drinking since Jan 1st and only one bottle of wine per session with a meal.

My group of friends and husbands are heavy drinkers so we spend a lot of time in the pub, what can I drink instead? I've tried diet coke but can only handle a few of them.  I'm trying to eat healthier so don't want lemonade as it is full of calories.  I'm not really a beer drinker, but will give anything a try.

Advice on drinks will hopefully help with my 9 day holiday that starts tomorrow with my husband, and we will probably spend a lot of time in the pub.   

I don't want to drink until I can't remember any more, but also would like to drink something.  So thinking of starting with non-alcoholic and then maybe wine with food and then back to non-alcohol.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8872681856155396}"

He wasn't able to walk for at least five months after it so I can only imagine what he was going through at the time while being bedridden. 

At first, all he did was cry when he was drunk. It was so loud I'd usually leave or stay in my room with music playing to drown it out. But as the years went by, he only got worse. 

Gradually he became more vocal, saying what was on his mind that he usually kept to himself when sober. Especially things about my stepmother or me that should be kept to himself. Even then I didn't realize the gravity of how wrong that was. Not until I got up to my senior year of high school. That's when he would shout and cuss at us. Not physically violent but enough to scare us. And I had such a hard time understanding why he was like this and why he would be harmful towards us. 

Now a few years after the pandemic I can't imagine how much worse he can get. He drinks and drives, mentally and verbally abuse me (recently come to terms with this), and drinks almost every day. 

I'd like to say that I still love him, but it's hard not to resent and hate him at the same time. I feel guilty admitting that but I'm not sure how else to express my feelings about it either.",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965797066688538}"

I no longer controlled my drinking, it  was controlling me now. And the amounts were going through the roof and death was near for me I could tell.  Jan. 22 , 2008 was it for me. I made  a decision I was an alcoholic and I could never drink again .On jan 23rd 2008 I started my journey.  5114 days later I don't feel like drinking. I don't want to go backwards.

Celebrated my friend's bday last night. We went to a nice Mexican themed restaurant. He knew I just got sober 44 days ago. Our third party member bailed. It was his bday and just us two. He orders a margarita. Then another. Then another. By the third, he is slurring his words. I offer him water. It's starting to feel real uncomfortable by this point because I'm sober and he's just making me feel like this dinner is a chore at this point. He tries to kiss me on the cheek, I pull back and say ""No."" 

I suggest we pay the bill and leave instead of camping out in this waitresses table. The concept is over his head, he never really understands that waitresses live off tips and need 3 rounds of patrons a night. He's 62, I don;t think he'll ever understand at this point. We usually try to get dinner tables later so he can be there 2 hours. I made the mistake of agreeing to a 5PM dinner with him. Terrible mistake.

He says, ""If we keep buying food and stuff, it's okay to stay."" I dislike this, but it's his bday so I just hope this ends soon.

He flags the waitress down and orders another drink, whatever the waitress recommends. She brings him a tequila version of an Old Fashioned. He hates it. He scowls at it. I tell him, ""you don't have to drink that, we can just finish our meals and take a walk,"" he says no, he'll drink it.

I keep ordering mocktails. They are delicious. He reads my bday card, and we hug, but tries to kiss me again, and does kiss my cheek. I pull back. Damnit.

I'm stuck here now. He's trashed. I finally ask for the bill. It's 9PM. We've been here 4 hours. I go to the restroom and return. He orders his last drink for the night, it's another margarita type drink. Damnit. I don't want him drinking and driving but my god am I drained.

He finally finished his drink, walks me to my car. And with our masks on, he kisses my cheek again.

If I didn't know this guy 16 years, I'd kick him in the balls. He drove him drunk. I drove home sober.

I don't know how he made it home, but he did.

I'm just processing this all. Do I tell him he was over the line for drinking in front of me? Do I set boundaries and tell him I can't hang out with him if he drinks more than 2 drinks ever again? Do I tell him the kissing was completely disrespectful. How do I keep my friend in my life but stay sober and stay strong, and happy. 

I will say, I never once wanted an ounce of drink last night. But who knows? I was a wine bottle a day drunk before this. Like, I don't know when my brain will turn on me one day and tell me to drink again. Any comments accepted. thanks for letting me vent.

It all started last year when my nan died. We were particularly close. I'd see her almost everyday and I helped my mum care for her in the weeks before her death. I've always had bad mental health and depression but it was manageable before this.
After she died I started having severe panic attacks. Ones that were so bad that I'd be calling an ambulance convinced I was dying. They got so out of control that that I quit my job, I stopped leaving the house, stopped meeting friends. I basically lost my life to the anxiety. 
The only thing that would stop the constant panic was having a drink. 
I'd have 2-3 glasses of gin and lemonade and the anxiety would just melt away.
I began to use alcohol to be able to do normal things. If I needed to go to the local shop for bread, I'd have a drink first. 
If I was having a very anxious day, I'd have a drink. 
It wouldnt just be one drink either. I'd drink 3 quarters a bottle of gin. 
This has been going on for a year and I'm scared. I binge drink 3/4 times a week. Maybe even more.
Its got the point that my mum is concerned. I get very defensive when she brings it up.
I've done some really stupid stuff when I'm drinking. I have no control when drunk and totally self sabotage. I Slept with idiots who couldn't give a toss about me, put myself into dangerous positions, try to commit suicide.

Has anyone ever succeeded on just reducing the amount, or only drinking socially? Is it possoble or should I just stop? I doubt I'm able to completely cut it forever. Is it too late to go back to being a normal 18yo?
I've also managed to drink only once since new year.

I get a lot of the medicinal benefits of THC without an overwhelming high. To me, it feels similar to quality CBD but with a kick. Yes, I still get a buzz but it is much more mild than Delta 9 or illegal substances and that's why I like it. I can't get too high on it and I don't get the negative side effects I've typically experienced from consuming regular Delta 9 products. It's more functional.

I'm an alcoholic addict and have been since age 12. I'm almost 30 now. I've tried many different things including medications such as Naltrexone and Antabuse to reduce or quit drinking and nothing has been very successful.

I discovered Delta 8 in 2019. It has changed my life. I'm able to use it and get real medicinal effects with the buzz that I crave while still maintaining normal functioning. I still drink but not nearly as much. 

I used to drink 2 fifths of vodka a day with beer as chasers. Now I usually have anywhere from 2 shots and 1 beer to 4 shots and 2 beers a night. To me that is an improvement and I'm not sure I could have reduced the amount this much without my use of Delta 8 and other cannabinoids.

I just woke up from what I believe was a 5 hour nap to countless missed calls from 6 of my friends. Yesterday, I let my drinking get kind of out of control and I let myself get too drunk off of vodka. My girlfriend had called me to talk about something important that was going on with her, and I can't remember a goddamn second of it. This led to a bit of a ""fight"", even though I wouldn't call it that.

Anyway, making her upset (especially if it has to do with my drinking) is something that makes me feel more shameful than anything else so I hate it when she's upset with me. She expressed how disrespected and insulted she felt because apparently I had reassured her that I was sober enough for her to talk to me about whatever was going on when I clearly wasn't.

In turn, obviously this led to me being upset all day. So when I woke up for work today, I was still drunk/very hungover (can't tell the difference at this point tbh), so I just decided to keep drinking throughout the day. When I got home, the last message my girlfriend got from me was that I was on my way home from work, but I had immediately passed out for a good 5 hours due to being so drunk. She was worried, since she was under the impression something had happened on my way back from work, so she called up all of my friends that she knew to try and get any type of information that she could on me. I woke up to so many missed calls from so many people, and if I didn't wake up when I did, they wouldn't contacted my mother to physically go and check on me like they have before when this type of thing would happen.

I'm so ashamed for not being able to control myself. I hate myself and I hate how worried I make my friends all of the time. I can't fuck up my relationship with my girlfriend. I need help.

I’ve been going to therapy for a few years and frequently talk about my drinking but it’s not helping. Pretty much all my mental and emotional issues are resolved but my drinking is still stuck, so I’m reaching out to my primary care doctor for possible medications. I’ve done some googling but curious to hear from actual people what different medicines do for them, both good/bad.

I drink sometimes to deal with stressful situations, ie a bad day at work or fight with a loved one. But most times it’s just because it’s fun. I like feeling buzzed, a LOT. My husband smokes weed and doesn’t really drink, and I’m really intrigued by vape pens because of the high but no smoke. He keeps saying I would really enjoy them and it would save my liver, but the problem is I can’t smoke because I could get randomly drug tested at my job. However, I could move to a different department, but it would be less pay and much more physically demanding. I really like my job now. I’m good at it and I love the challenges it brings. So I’m really torn. Anyone switch over to weed after drinking? Would love to hear how it went.

Not the first time I’ve injured myself drunk, but never like this. I proceeded to get up and dance half naked on stage, with a broken rib. I brushed it off for a few days but after the pain got worse I took myself to hospital.

I’m housebound for the foreseeable future and it’s quite miserable. I’m on a low dose of codeine (prescribed) for the pain so I literally can’t drink, but this has given me a moment to think about my actions and how alcohol is ruining a lot. 

I want to get fit, lose weight, be healthier, study more, and focus on what’s really important. It’s been my goal to improve my life, and I’ve been trying, but that next drink has always taken priority. ‘Just tonight’ turns into the next day, then the day after, which leads to 5 or 6 days in a row. I’ve lost myself in the process. I’ve taken breaks from drinking before, and God I love not being hungover, but I think ‘just tonight’ should be a daily mantra I apply to being sober from now on - every day. 

I’m not worried about telling my friends I’m stopping drinking, but most of our plans revolve around it. I can stop drinking alone, but my worry is that a night out with my friends will trigger a binge or me drinking alone again. I have bipolar type 2 and when I’m hypomanic I tend to binge too. It’s always a balance. 

If you’ve been in a similar situation, how did you do it? Are you able to get into a place where you can safely drink?

I went through my very heavy phase for the longest duration, probably for 1.5 years I was killing a 1.75 L in 3-4 nights along with beer. Then for the last year I've been trying my best to stick to a pint of vodka, but then along with too many beers. 

I got covid a week and a half ago so I didn't drink for around 4 days and my withdrawals were worse then ever. Mostly heavy sweating, heavy shakes, and thats mostly been it but then for the last two nights I've had Hypnogogic Hallucinations... all night. It's not as bad as what I've read others have experienced, but im still terrified cause it seems like what could come after Hallucinations could be Seizures.

I fully plan on weining myself off now that I have a head start on the shittieness. I just wanted to see if there's anyone who has been in my shoes, and how you went about weining yourself off. I really, really don't want to go in to detox although I know it's the safest.

Well, I woke up today after this pattern and of course I went ahead and grabbed me a beer.  Chugged it and felt uneasy right after I did it.  I never puke up alcohol but this was a rare time I actually did.  I puked it up and then at the very end I puked up blood.

It was definitely an ""oh shit"" moment for me.  I thought it might have been a fluke and just a one time thing but when i was brushing my teeth I went ahead and forced myself to puke and yep of course some coagulated blood came out.

Advice?","Hi. I was seeing this guy, let's call him L (25M) who was a recovering alchololic. I didn't know at first how serious it was and he was 6 months sober, but he said he was never doing that well before and it felt different than any other time he tried. He was actively doing everything right, in therapy, built himself a structure to stay sober. I thought it was okay. We became very intense but were open and honest and happy, very emotionally available and healthy at setting boundaries. He did tell me a month in that his alchololism was much worse than I had imagined before and then i started to wonder if he should even be dating since he didn't have a year. we had a serious conversation about it, talked to both our therapists, but since we seemed to be doing well, and he wasn't drinking and didn't think he would, we decided to take me going home for christmas as a tester. I thought we were doing well over the break in seeing eachother, and we were for a bit. But he apparently almost relapsed. He didn't leave his room for four days, two weeks after being apart. He didn't eat for 6 days, he lost a stone (14lbs), he had to stop himself from drinking by taking 2 hour showers, he told me he hurt himself which he never did, all to stop him from drinking. He said that he had built a structure to keep in going, but it wasn't strudy enough to handle the wobble of a new relationship. He was apparently doing well on the high of us being together, we were so happy and doing so well, but when I left he didn't pick himself back together or return to his coping mechanisms. We had to break up which is heartbreaking, we both feel so strongly about eachother. I normally don't feel like connections are even real but this seemed so rare. He wants us to try being friends but I don't know if I can do that for him with out it being complicated which would further jeapordise his recovery. I care about him so much and want to be there for him (there were other things contributing to his downward spiral, not just me) but I don't know how. Right now we are in limbo, going to talk again. 

I just want advice, or words of encouragement. I just want to know what I need to do so he'll be okay - I'm heartbroken we can't be together and the timings off, and so is he, but I don't want him to jeaoprodise his health and recovery. I don't know how to be there for him without being a problem. It also makes me doubt if his feelings for me were genuine and could have been healthy and good at another time, or if they were just a type of high? He says he won't try dating at all after this (we were just supposed to be a causual hook up, he didn't intend for this to happen but then, we clicked) because this is one in a million to him, which makes it even harder because I think he's right. I guess I'm just sad and scared for him. I wanted to be able to be with him through any of his struggled, even if he did relapse I wanted to be able to support his recovery, but I didn't realise how much I was putting it in danger. If anyone has advice or words of wisdom, that would be so appreciated. I'm kind of at a loss, I want to see him in any way but I need to and will do what's best for him and his recovery.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9446336030960083}"

I don't have hangovers like we all complained about when we were young! I'm a spry 36-year-old that people always say looks much younger.  (I guess good genes and I didn't smoke?) No idea, because I've destroyed my body the last 15 years. Nonetheless, I've become increasingly concerned as of the last few years. I attended an uncle's funeral and found out many skeletons of many people's closets and it pushed me to the limit. Has anyone felt so bad after pushing the limits for a few days that they then become red all over their body and out of breath for a couple days? Can't really walk right, shaking for a few days while still intaking like 10ish/night, horrific headache etc. for like a week straight? I mean I got the hot/cold sweats and tossing and turning, but I wasn't quitting. I was still at 10+/ night. Heart beating super fast might be the worst part. Honestly, it's not like it's the first time it's happened, but going through withdraws when I still was taking 10+ just so they didn't get worse. I realize it's not healthy. It's probably happened like 20 times over the last couple of years. I also work with doctors, so I feel like they all know, and I'm performing a circus act walking a tightrope. This last time was the worst. 

I do know inflammation is no joke, it's linked to like 120 diseases, (the worst being cancer, diabetes, heart disease), and alcohol causes inflammation, so it's only an amount of time. I just wonder what all those symptoms mean. The kidney alone can cause pain basically anywhere. Are all my organs are mad? My body is slowly dying? Both? I also just stopped using birth control. But shooting pains everywhere mixed with feeling like I can't catch my breath is scary when I'm a normal weight for my height. I think I reach an alcohol induced level of amenia. I'm just scared of all of the pains. I mean, for the last 7 or 8 years I've been averaging about 15 to 20 shots a night, (I've got single digits for certain months spread throughout). 

I mean, I guess I know the answers. . . I just need someone to talk to. I honestly think it's more than just an addiction. I think I'm unhappy, and it's not about myself. It's a general apathy about the world even though I'm the kindest soul to everyone. The world is a piece of shit and I realize I'm a tiny piece of sand in the ocean. So, I drink to ease the day when everything horrible is happening that everyone chooses to ignore and nothing is done about? Yes, I'm equating my drinking with the world's problems. Could I be much more attractive if I really tried?  Yes. I have friends that, that's all they do and people think they're amazing for just being pretty. I guess that's all they care about. Could I have finished my masters?  Yes. But, I looked into my career path and it's not necessarily going to help with pay or competition. Could I have succeeded further though? Most definitely. I know I squandered opportunities and left some soot on some bridges. I'm upset about that. Could I save my relationship? Yes. I might be able to. Can I save my body? No idea.

Hi,

I am 24 years old and I've just starting officially going out with a guy who is 28 years old. I'm a small woman who doesn't really drink so when we first went out and he drank 15-20 pints of beer in one night I was taken aback, but I didn't think too much about it because people sometimes do like to let themselves go as people like to say. However, every time we have gone out to different pubs he is always drinking at least 4 pints to my 1 pint. He works in a building society and earns a very good wage, but after he's finished work he goes to his local for a few beers and then he'll ring me (without sounding drunk at all, but I know he has a few beers because my friend works at the pub) and we'll go and watch a fillm at a cinema and then back to the local for a few beers and then I'll stay at his place (he has a 4-bedroom house and he has already let me have one of the rooms to myself). He never gets a hangover. He's up at 5am and gets himself sorted and then leaves to go to work.

I've stayed at his for a few days and every day he drank 3-4 litres of cider, about 8 cans of beer and some whisky or a couple of bottles of wine.

On a Friday he finishes early and I meet him in town and we go for something to eat and then we'll go to restuarants and pubs and then get a takeaway and go home. On the weekend he'll cook us something to eat, but he drinks a couple of bottles of wine by 3pm and then we'll go out.

He went to college and then university. He reads lots of books. He's a very educated man. He's also a very quiet man who never causes any trouble.

From what he has told me, his ex-girlfriend wasn't very nice to him and it hit him hard.

I get on very well with his mother and I work part-time so sometimes I meet up with her during the week and we go shopping or for a bite to eat.

I mentioned my concerns to my mother and she told me that I shouldn't worry as long as he treats me right and avoids drugs (her best friend died of a drug overdose). My father also used to go to the pub in the evenings and it never was a problem for my mother.

I've just got to this charming point in the proceedings where drinking actually makes you feel BETTER. I remember this, from last time. About 8 hours after I last drank (so basically your standard work day), I start to feel sick, and get the hiccups. If I persist, I start to feel  like I'm going to vomit. If I still persist in my foolish foray into sobriety, I start vomiting. If that's not enough to push me back into a bottle, I then start vomiting blood. The tremors really kick in about then, along with the hallucinations, fever, hiccups and more vomiting blood. If I drink, though ... About 7 straight shots in short succession in, and my symptoms just go away. All I feel is pleasantly buzzed. 
I know I'm dying. Again. I know the symptoms, from the white shits to the seizures. It's been 7 years since I had to do this. I lived to see 30, my life improved. But now, here we are again, the only thing thing that makes me start to feel better is the one thing poisoning me. I think I'll go in for drug and alcohol counseling this time. Maybe there's help to be had there. This time though, I have good people in my life, who care if I live or die.

It’s Wednesday afternoon and we haven’t had a drop of alcohol since Saturday night.. which is like BIG for us. I can’t remember the last time we abstained as many as four days straight, or even TWO!!! The past couple years, we’ve been drinking every single day or every other day (if hungover bad)

Day 1 - utter anxiety.. sleep was hard.. I felt BORED with everything and could not stop thinking of booze. We both felt on edge and kinda walked on eggshells around eachother. I drank so much chamomile tea, had a shot of zzzquil. Sleep didn’t come easy. Woke up every hour.

Day 2 - same shit. Hard to wind down at night, quality of sleep: shit. Drank so much tea, whenever I felt the “need” to imbibe. Reading helps. Keeps my mind off it. I think the zzzquil wears off after a few hours, so waking up at like 3am sucks because it’s hard to fall back asleep.

Day 3 - Last night. Finally was back at work so my day was filled and occupied from 1pm-10. Jogged to and from, to tire myself, which helped! Anxiety was less. Thoughts of drinking not so intrusive. Came home, ate a light dinner, drank a few cups of tea, took a hot shower and got comfy in bed, reading til I fell asleep around 1:30. Didn’t take the zzzquil and I slept better and longer, but my first night having nightmares. Very stressful dreams, and my partner told me I screamed in my sleep (which I woke myself up to) Oddly enough, I slept pretty well except the weird dreams (being hunted and chased with the threat of torture)

Day 4 - Today. The “withdrawal” symptoms aren’t nearly as bad, as far as feeling anxious, bodily ickiness, and shaky hands. I work 5:30pm-11 and we still won’t be drinking tonight.

Day 5 - Tomorrow (Thursday). We finally get paid again. Kinda feeling like all bets are gonna be off. 

If anything, I’m hoping maybe now we can start to limit ourselves.. to certain days, to not drink in excess now that I know we CAN go as many as four days. I can’t see myself quitting altogether yet but I’m kinda proud of us.

I'm (32f) currently separated from my partner (45m) of 13 years while I try to figure out whether I want to keep trying.

My partner is a regular heavy drinker. He drinks to the point of being wasted every Friday and Saturday night. Also uses cocaine every weekend (small ish amounts but very consistently every weekend). In the process of us becoming separated, I've brought up the issue of his substance use. My dad died when I was a child from an IV cocaine overdose, my mom was an addict, I have somehow narrowly avoided the same path. The cocaine is not the topic of my question but wanted to give context as to why I'm not ok with being around it.

When I brought up the fact I'm not ok with the cocaine, he said he understood but ""you know I'm not going to stop drinking"". He feels that getting wasted every Friday and Saturday night is not an issue, he can't possibly be an alcoholic, because he doesn't drink every day. He has long standing depression, anxiety, and a lack of self worth. I told him that I wished he didn't feel the need to get so wasted every weekend. That if he found a way to be comfortable with himself, perhaps by engaging with therapy, that he might no longer want to. 

But it seems like he's not interested, and not willing to do this work. I'm at the stage where I'm thinking I want to start a family (I know .. after 13 years together... we've both avoided thinking too hard about our future together). I just can't have a kid with someone who insists on getting blackout drunk and doing blow every weekend night. And those evenings when he's drunk are the only times when he's open with me about his depression and self loathing. Another huge issue is that he doesn't remember these conversations the next day.

Some of you may remember a month or 2 ago I posted on here. That in itself was a big thing for me.
I had a couple of great, helpful messages and I set myself a goal.
The goal was to get through the stressful Christmas period in work, and then, make an effort to stop drinking, as I was pretty close to being hospitalised with the amount of blood I was throwing up, and crippling pains in my chest.

I just want to say thank you to those who took the time to message me with advice and encouragement.

I am 12 days sober today. Longest I have been in about 15 years. I remember Day 8 was the hardest for me after a really stressful day with some other personal bad news, but I got through it and I'm feeling great.
Some nights I find it hard to sleep, but in general, it's not as bad as I thought.

Another plus, I've not thrown up blood, nor have I had that chest pain since.

I want to do a full month, and then try 'moderation drinking'. I've saved over £120 already so the money is a real big motivator.

Our mums boyfriend didn't want my little sister to go with them as he 'didn't want to babysit', while they went away on their drinking voyage.
They then decided to ask my older sister to look after our younger sister.
They already knew she would say no, so were already mad at her before asking.
So she said no and my mum went on this big rant about how selfish, ungrateful, snobby, rude and bitchy she was because she wasn't doing this for mum after 'everything she did for her in raising us.' 

Mind you, it was admittedly the bare minimum. She can't go one night without drinking and drinks heavily on the weekends. Is constantly covered in bruises. Used to bring home strangers, leave us home alone for hours on end when we were very young.

Hell, I even remember one night she was driving home from the pub with her friend and there were 4 of us kids in the boot of the car under the age of 7, and they crashed through a fence and into a creek and laughed about it.

The point is; she thinks we owe her because she still fed us, took us to school, bought our clothes and took care of us generally. But that was it.

Now she's over it and most weekends tries to pawn my little sister off to either her crack head dad's place or her friends houses.

Me and my older sister have already had an intervention with her (she drank a bottle of wine and half a bottle of gin that night), it didn't go well.

We can't really get child protection involved because she technically is still taking care of her, again i.e, cooking, cleaning,, buying clothes and takes her to school etc.

2022-01-11 17:11:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/s1p5k9/alcohol_withdrawals_had_some_questions/,Alcohol withdrawals. Had some questions.,"
Hi everyone. This is my first post on here. I hope you’re all doing well in your journeys. I’m going through a bit of an experience at the moment and figured this would be the best place to come if I had any questions regarding anything. 

So basically I’m 23 years old, 24 in a few days. For maybe the last 2 and a half years or so, I’ve been drinking pretty much every single night. My main drinking habit would be to have 3 or 4 large bottles of 6.8% cider to end the night on, then eventually crash to sleep. I’m not even sure how I allowed this to become a nightly habit in my life, but here we are. I’ve gone from a guy in a school not too many years ago, beaming with confidence, always complimented on my looks, skinny/lean, and had the whole world ahead of me. I am now barely a fraction of that person that I used to be. I’ve put on a load of weight and have let myself go completely. I’m ashamed. 

I made the decision around the 18th of December to not have any alcohol until I went and spent time with my family on Christmas Eve, so I went 6 days without any alcohol at all. To be honest I surprised myself and it was only the sleeping side of things that I would struggle with to start with, I’d shout out in my sleep a lot if I did eventually get off and would jump at nothing a lot too and wake myself up. I didn’t crave alcohol at all during this time off that I had. 

I’d planned to keep this going. I want/wanted to stop drinking every single night and still do now of course. Over the last week and a half or so, I adapted myself to having say for example 4 days of drinking, then 4 days not drinking and I planned to stick to this. I had a drink 3 nights ago (6 cans of strong cider), but told myself I didn’t want to have a drink for another 5 days or just however long felt good for me. 
Well the day after having the ciders, I began to experience heart palpitations. I’d probably stopped drinking and went to sleep at around 2am, and began to feel them 2pm the next day so like 12 hours later. I’ve had them before but from what I recall only ever the day after having cocaine or other stimulants. The palpitations would ALWAYS be gone the following day when I’d woken up in a better state, so I just assumed that my drinking from the night before had caused them and that they would be gone the next day. 
The day goes on, I’m still getting palpitations but doing my best to ignore them. I run myself a bath and while doing so the palpitations feel worse, I get in the bath and then I’m pretty sure I had a panic attack. I felt run down after this but was able to get on with my night, palpitations still causing me discomfort throughout the night but I eventually get off to sleep around 5am & am determined I will feel better in the morning. 

I wake up, get on with my day again, do some shopping. The palpitations seem to have calmed down a hell of a lot but I’m still wary as I can feel things going on around my heart but again doing my best to ignore which I do until that night. I start getting these huge waves of anxiety, some chest pain and palpitations. I feel a panic attack or something coming on so I take myself outside. At this point my mind is made up that I need to go and see a doctor which I do. I have a feeling they’re just going to tell me it’s anxiety as that’s all I thought it was as I’ve battled anxiety and depression for a long while which have only worsened over the last few years. 
I get in there, explain to them my drinking habits over the last couple of years and they pretty much there and then told me I was experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms. They took a number of tests including my ECG (heart) which came back as normal but my blood levels of course weren’t good I guess mainly due to the drinking/drugs/poor diet over the last few years. 
I was shocked. Shocked because I didn’t realise how much abuse I’d essentially put my body through over the last couple of years for me to even be getting withdrawals, and shocked because I was getting withdrawals maybe only 12 hours or so after my last drink, especially when I had gone 6 days with no drink only at the end of December with no symptoms of alcohol withdrawals at all. (Really sorry for the long post, I’ll get to my questions now.)

I’ve been given antibiotics as I have a slight chest infection which they discovered. They advised me not to jump straight off the alcohol cold turkey, and to kinda carry on with what I’m doing where I’m having some days on and some days off. Only thing about this is that antibiotics and alcohol are not meant to be mixed are they? I have 5 days left to continue taking my antibiotics for so guess I won’t be drinking for another 5 days at least then...
Despite all that, what in your opinion is the best way to go about stopping/dramatically decreasing alcohol intake just so that my body is able to get used to it in the best way possible? I don’t want to completely quit drinking but I definitely want to build a better relationship with it than what I have and just don’t want to do it every single night anymore.

This is not about AA (you're welcome) -- I believe in AA, but I'm talking about an earlier step.  We can call this ""step 0.5: You can quit in 5 days and also not seize at an AA meeting.""

I'm talking about medical detox.  Some vets of this sub probably think it's common knowledge, but if you're new to this like I was several months ago, it could save you a lot of uncomfortability.  Once you learn how it works (or can work,) you may not be as hesitant to look into it.

This is how it has worked for me through a few relapses:

1. Message PCP, I can't stop drinking safely, may I please do a Librium taper from home.

2*  Pick up Librium from pharmacy.

3.  Take descending amounts of 25mg Librium or 20mg Serax for 5 days -- be sleepy, don't drive.  

3.5 Never shake, never sweat, never cry, never scream, never puke.

4. Congratulations.  You're still an alcoholic, but you're not physically dependent on alcohol.  Hit up a meeting when you feel like you're no longer a benzo zombie.

*Your doc may send you to the ER because of the nature of your request to check your liver and pancreas.  They'll give you shorter acting benzos while you're there.

I've done this from home a few times and at inpatient rehab twice.  It worked so well I thought maybe I wasn't prone to WD.  I went 24 hours sober before one inpatient, and yes, I'm very prone to a hellish WD.

Here’s some background information before I get into the story:
-She has been an alcoholic since 11th grade. -She hasn’t been sober in 6 months, not a day has gone by that she didn’t buy any wine to drink. 
-She broke up with her toxic boyfriend 6 months ago and got diagnosed with major depression and got prescribed Zoloft. Ever since then, she has been going to the bars religiously and staying up till 6-7 am and wake up around 5pm in the afternoon. 
-She just changed her sexuality to bi and slept with a girl for the first time. 
-She has a cousin who has been sending her large amounts of money since thanksgiving, giving her a used car and not making her pay for it, gave her $200 for new tires, and she asked him for $600 for rent money. I don’t know how this “cousin” is sending her so much money, it seems really sketchy. 
-she has been babysitting her 9-12 year old cousins and letting them drink, exposing them to weed, making them help her steal decor from apartment complex’s and stores, and even made the 12 year old to drive her around because she was too drunk to drive. 



Here’s the start of the story. 
So she asked her cousin for rent money, turned around spent $800 on a condo at the beach (4 hrs away) and took two cousins with her at 11 pm at night. She didn’t spend the money on rent. (Keep in mind that she has a serious money problem and cannot save for ANYTHING) at the beach she let the cousins drink and steal from stores like Victoria secret and a bunch of others. She had almost gotten into a wreck from drinking so she told the 12 year old to drive. 

The mom of the little girls found out and told my friend to never speak to her kids ever again. So my friend decided to pack up all her things and take two dogs with her (one of the dogs she had just got and its a pit Bull puppy, hadn’t even taken it to the vet yet) to drive 27 hours to California to stay with a family member (who got kicked out the military for doing coke and is also an alcoholic) to apparently “get sober” and “go to therapy”. I deadass walked into my apartment and all her things were gone and she had not mentioned she was doing this and just left without saying a word. 

So I called her and she told me her plan of driving there, and how she wasn’t spending money on hotels and was gonna sleep in her car on the side of the road when she got tired. All her family members and friends tried to convince her to turn around because it’s so dangerous to travel alone and without money. Also illegal to sleep in the car. 

She ends up loosing her dog 5 hrs into the trip in downtown New Orleans. Gets a speeding ticket for going 40 over. Card gets declined at a gas station for a redbull.

Now she’s in New Mexico. She gets in a car crash, flipping her car 3 times and she survived, as well as the animals. She totaled her car. I found out later she was drinking and driving. She told me the alcohol “saved her life” because is made her calm and it didn’t tense up her body…

She had just cut me off because I informed her mom she crashed due to alcohol. Which is fine I know one day she’ll forgive me. 

Her plan is essentially to serve in “an exclusive restaurant in La” but she is living in San Diego, which is 2 hrs away, not including traffic. She said she was getting a 2018 mustang. But with what money? 

She is saying a irrational things and is behaving so crazy and risky, not considering consequences. 

Is my friend manic right now? I am wondering what kind of illness this sounds like because I know it’s not normal behavior. Not normal considering she has no money and no plan. Thanks to whoever read all this. I just want answers.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988640546798706}"

Sometimes just drink it clears me for a bit and makes me feel like none of that never happened and I’m just…here for once. But then it gets worse

I’ve lived with my roommate for a year and he knows my history and I struggle sometimes. But I’ve never let him see me get this bad. The other night I went to my local bar for a while and kept drinking.
Later when I got home I was still drinking. Ir got to the point I was breaking down and CHUGGING beers. My roommate found me slumped over the sink and I broke down in tears for a bit. The alcohol was taking more than ever and I just fell onto the ground barely able to hold myself up and just broke down in a puddle of tears and a drunken mess. Thankfully, he sat there and listened to me and comforted me…which I really appreciate it

I’m in therapy. I do coping mechanisms, I’m on medication, I’m doing better than I have in years. But alcohol is always around. Collapsed on the floor in a drunken crying mess…is just another memory sitting in my head.

I'm a 34 year old male. I've drank straight vodka every single night for 10 years now. I have never had an issue functioning, and maintained employment and relationships. I recently lost my job because my stomach issues have gotten so bad. I was looking for any kind of advice to help with these symptoms, because as of now, I'm basically homebound do to being in a car making my pain so bad.

Im usually fine in the mornings. But around 3/4pm, I start feeling extremely gassy and bloated. I can't lay down to sleep through it because the gas builds up so quickly I must constantly burp. I also end up with a ridiculous amount of saliva, to the point that I could basically spit every second while smoking. Sometimes, I feel kinda light headed, but Idk if that is just me doing it to myself, but I frequently gag for no reason, and sometimes have a... almost septic, metallic taste in my mouth. Also, I lose pretty much all strength. I can barely stand, I just feel so rundown. Shaking as well.Again, being in a car makes me feel like my chest is going to explode. I'm assuming from vibration. I'm trying to figure out if this is withdrawal, or something more scary. I'm avoiding the doctor because I don't have insurance, but mainly because I'm scared to get in the car.

I don't have any issue with eating, or bowel movements. No blood in anything that I'm aware of. 

The worst part, drinking is the only thing that alleviates these issues. Which makes me think withdrawal, but there is no way I'd be having those, only 8-12 hours after my last drink right?

Anyone that can provide me any info, please do. Unfortunately, stopping drinking probably isn't an option for me. Not without something else to take away the pain. I'm not a strong enough person to do that cold turkey stuff. I'm just seeing if anyone knows anything about this stuff cause the internet has 1000 different answers and I can't figure out which it is, or what to do. 

I'd really love to just find a way to make the gas and chest pain stop, long enough to at least get to the doctor. At this point, if active pain wasn't waiting for me, I think I'd probably quit.

I'm 21 years old, and I began drinking when I was 18 (got my ID, drank heavily at parties before then and always wanted ID so I could drink at home).

I'm not quite sure what to write - on average I've drank a bottle of vodka or so (that's the usual amount for me to black out) a night in the years since then, sometimes more sometimes less, with the occasional 2-3 day break to study for uni exams (while recreationally taking street benzos to lessen WD symptoms). I began a relationship with someone at some point during these 3 years that caused a burst of motivation to finally quit drinking, and I quit cold turkey for 10 days. In those 10 days I went through some insane withdrawals, including auditory/visual hallucinations, tremors, etc. I went cold turkey because I didn't want my family to know about my condition, as stupid as that sounds. This was maybe 7 months ago.

Anyhow, my drinking has only gotten worse, drinking pretty much everyday, sometimes all day, sometimes at night, sometimes in the morning, passing out constantly. I wake up and tell myself I want to quit. I have a diary where I log my thoughts throughout the day, including while drunk, and after that initial drink I always regret it, then I numb myself until I black out. Even old memories I used to look back on fondly of drinking at parties are now muddied, I don't think of alcohol as anything good (consciously, anyway) and I want to break this cycle. 

I don't think I'm ever going to hit a ""rock bottom"" - I've had so many instances of me losing relationships, run ins with the law, possible STDs, health issues despite my age, and none of them have been enough of an impetus, even combined, to make me quit. 

I tell myself constantly I need to go through medical detox, I can't keep living like this, I want to stop, but my mind always goes back to drinking because being sober means I need to actually live, if that makes any sense. I feel like I'm at odds with myself constantly about wanting to quit drinking, although in the past 3 months every day I've been telling myself I want to stop and thinking I want to stop but I can't take the first step. 

Sorry, this is very long winded. I want to stop drinking but I'm afraid to. I also don't want my family to know about my condition if I go through medical detox because the added stress will make me want to drink more, and my parents aren't reasonable. I guess I'm asking for advice, and venting.

This is also verified by another sibling who used to live with him, but kicked him out because he wouldn't get help. Now he lives alone. He will guzzle alcohol until he passes out(cheap vodka), wake up and get more, and drink continuously for about 3 days. He was calling out of work sick due to withdrawal and lost 2 jobs before this one. He is lucky they're keeping him right now, they're understaffed and need the help.

When he's not drinking, he keeps up appearances very well. He often talks about job promotions or traveling or new cars, but also having money problems. Last night talking about his drinking, he's concerned he might be bipolar, and will go 3 days without sleeping which he says is his biggest motivation for drinking, he's also a veteran. (Can't sleep, so drinks so he finally can. Have family alcoholics who encouraged this habit.) 

He almost had the police called on him for not looking after his son. He had ex-girlfriends watch him on the days he was suppose to because he was drunk.

SKIP HERE: What can I do to help him without enabling him?

My relationship with alcohol has never been healthy. I could never just have one drink. But during the pandemic (like so many others) I became a daily heavy drinker. Hiding it from my family, daughter and husband (well at least I thought I did).

These past two months had become a nightmare. All I could think about was purchasing, planning and hiding my next drink. What’s more I felt like hell, physically and emotionally. Throwing up, stomach pains, foggy head, exhausted, my skin is wrecked and my hair had begun falling out. I found myself thinking I’d be better off dead.

I was hospitalized before thanksgiving for heart palpitations. Turns out my potassium had fallen extremely low (guess why?) I was released without being honest with my doctors. I’m sure they knew what had caused it. I got my metabolic panel back and just like anyone could have guessed… I had all the obvious indicators of alcoholism. But I still hit the bottle with the excuse “after Christmas I’ll deal with this”. 

I put on a brave face, but I was miserable the whole holiday. But there was always one little glimmer still left in me, that would say “this isn’t it, there’s something else for you”. Thursday I was driving and seriously contemplated driving off the side of the road. 

I wrote my husband a letter, I was still too ashamed of my addiction to say it out loud or to his face. And basically said I’ve been drowning in a  dark place and I’m lost. Told him about the car incident and that it had scared the hell out of me. Told him I couldn’t be a good wife or mother until I got help. 

Dumped all my booze and Went to the ER. Sat in the car for 30 minutes asking myself if I could really do this, and I did. I was completely honest and started medical detox. The staff, who I was scared would be judgmental, have been lovely and supportive. And so has my family.

Currently on Librium and Adivan along with fluids and plenty of vitamins. After detox I’ll be entering an intensive outpatient rehab program. I know it’s going to be one of the hardest things I do, but I’m so ready to be unburdened. Alcohol has felt like weights around my neck. Using alcohol to solve problems it was causing would have Killed me. But that’s what I was doing.

I’ve just found this group after growing increasingly anxious over my drinking habits.

I’m 21F and I’ve always had impulse issues when it comes to marijuana, other drugs, and recently alcohol. I find that as long as it is not around me, I do not crave it, but when it is in my reach I overindulge until the substance is finished. 
I recently stopped smoking weed, not a conscious decision as I did not feel dependent but it just didn’t interest me anymore.

I struggle with anxiety and insomnia, and have been fixing myself two stiff drinks before bed instead of smoking every single night. I don’t end up sleeping until I get the spins and really feel it. I don’t drink during the day and don’t find it affects my life outside of later hours, but I’m worried that this issue could progress. 

Due to living in a student house, there is constantly alcohol around me, and I’ve even taken a few shots out of my roommates’ almost empty liquor bottles without their knowledge (and replaced them the next day as we buy alcohol communally). 

Does anyone have any advice on how to kick this habit when I’m living in an environment surrounded by it?

I started drinking around seven years ago. it started with an older family member buying me a four loko every weekend to them buying me two tall boys every few days then I turned 21 and I was drinking about a six pack every day or every other day. I hardly ever got slammed, I didn’t like to drink to that point. For me a sixer always hit the sweet spot. Of course there were times where I was off work or had company so I went a little too hard and woke up on the floor with pounding headaches and on those days I would tell myself “I should stop for awhile” but then I’d crave beer the next day. Just the other day, I had one of those sessions when I woke up still drunk with no recollection of even going to bed, fighting the feeling to puke and losing to disgusting yellow bile. “I’m never drinking again” two days later I’m walking home with two tall boys. It’s never caused problems in any of my relationships. For the most part, I’m able to handle myself pretty well as long as I kept within the sixer count. Most people tell me they can’t tell I’ve been drinking. A lot of the problems came from money. I found myself spending more money on beer than food. Sometimes I’d have to put my whole check to rent and then use loose change to get tall boys. Sometimes I wouldn’t even have enough for rent or bills and I’d still use the money I didn’t have for beer. I’d look at the beer before I opened it, feel shame and self loathing at how I was broke and still buying beer then I’d crack it open and chug. Ive gotten better at making sure I take care of my rent and bills but I still often use my spending money on booze. When I’m sober, I look forward to drinking then when I’m buzzed, I think of sobriety. It’s always on that fifth beer I tell myself “I’m going to stop after this. The last one is the last one” and the farthest I’ve got was a week before I was back at it. I get a strong craving, my mouth waters and I can taste that sweet Crawford bock, my stomach grumbles and I finally give in and that first chug is sensational. I hate that. I hate feeling like I need it. I hate spending money on a six pack instead of dinner. I hate that i feel like i need a drink to enjoy something like a movie or spending time with family or friends. I hate how even after writing all this, I’m thinking about getting a six pack on my way home from work. I know there are people like me and people who have it worse. My own father was a terrible drunk and he was able to quit. I want to quit and i know that I can. Maybe I’m just not trying hard enough?

I took two capsules and noticed a dramatic improvement in my withdrawal symptoms.  I no longer felt as jittery and if I recall correctly, my insomnia actually subsided.

Afterwards, I decided to look online to see if there was any information relating to bacopa and alcohol withdrawals. I found at least one scientific study, and several articles mentioning that bacopa has been found to help withdrawals, and is used in herbal medicine for that purpose.

I later offered some bacopa to another alcoholic who was suffering from withdrawals (again, 2 capsules).  Within about half an hour, her tremors had all but stopped, and she reported feeling much better.

Has anyone else here tried bacopa for their withdrawals? Could this be the next mainstream thing for mild or moderate withdrawals?

I go days without a drink just cause I don't want or need to. I can pace myself when we are home together or just obstain when I've got work or an appointment. The only issue I have noticed is when we go out to a bar. I lose my sense of self control and just chug.

Last night, we went to a bar next door. Drove (separately) cause it's cold. We had just talked about our relationship and we were in high spirits. We did have a drink or two before leaving. Everything was good. We ate some food and ordered drinks. He got his usual crown on the rocks with a side of water. I got a long Island ice tea with some water. We made conversations with the guys next to us. As the night went along I noticed it was almost closing. We ordered a last round, same drinks. I actually felt tipsy after the first drink, but I was happy and enjoying our time together. I shouldn't have ordered that second long Island.

I don't remember what happened after that at all.

From my sparse memories, it was past closing and the bartender was worried about me and called the police. At this point I have no idea where my BF went, obviously back to our cabin. My brother and father came to pick me up.

Once at my apartment, I was trying to call my BF and he tried to call me. From the records, I missed a lot of them. Two calls I made and they are around 8 minutes each. I don't remember those conversations at all. The last one I made was at 6am and it was a minute. Basically I came to my sense a bit and just wanted to know where he was. He was still at our cabin. He didn't sound mad, but I assume that he might be upset.

I feel awful. This is the second time this has happened. Not the police, but getting basically kicked out of a bar. I being the reason. I can just commit to not drinking out anymore, but often times when I'm with my BF I try to match him and just lose it. I don't want to be an alcoholic, but maybe I already am? 

I don't know how to tackle this issue. I've got to make changes.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9959418177604675}"
2022-01-05 00:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/rwez9d/im_worried_about_my_friend/,I’m worried about my friend,"One of my close friends likes to drink a lot of wine. He seems pretty normal and pleasant when he drinks and as someone who is close to him I feel pretty sure it’s not impacting his social life or his work but I can’t shake the feeling that he does it way too much and he does it because he can’t stop and I worry that it’s harming him. 

I don’t know for sure but I would guess he drinks 3-4 evenings a week and when he does he has at least one bottle of wine by himself, often more, and sometimes two bottles. He often drinks alone but he also often invites me over (I live close by) and I’ve started getting the impression he’s using my company as an excuse to drink because with me around he’s doing it socially. He’s very affable and conversational when drunk so it’s not like he becomes belligerent and intolerable but he drinks until he can’t keep his eyes open and mumbles all his words and then I just excuse myself. He has other friends but I don’t think any of them see how often and how much he drinks like I do. 

I don’t drink at all so I’m not great at figuring out what’s normal drinking and what’s problem drinking but I suspect he may have an addiction. I always thought drinking to get drunk by yourself was a sign that things were not right but I don’t know. I know he has non drinking days, which at first I found comforting but now just seems like both a sign that he knows he drinks too much and a sign that he can’t just have one glass without finishing the bottle (i.e., he knows if he doesn’t want to drink a lot he has to not drink at all). 

Am I worrying needlessly? I couldn’t forgive myself if one day I found out he was drinking alone at home, had more than he realized, and died from it somehow. I’ve seen him polish off two bottles of wine by himself in one sitting before and I can’t imagine the alcohol poisoning threshold is far away from that.

This truly has been worst year to date and still I am craving my next drink to the point its calling out to me.
 I miss playing my video games and really miss working on my drawings but I never had time because I was always to drunk to do anything besides sit down and watch TV. At first it was fun to drink but as time went on it turned into a bigger and bigger problem to the point when I was terrified to stop even for a day but I managed it a few times but like I said earlier I have never been sober for more than 3 months.

The past 3 days I have been cleaning my apartment to stay busy and keep yelling at my self that I don't need it.

So I will say up front I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything alcohol related, but people closest to me in my life have mentioned it as a possible problem. For a number of months now I have been drinking pretty heavily. Not every day, but most, and drinking more than a few drinks when I do. I have had periods where I’ve stopped for a week or two. As of New Years I made the resolution to break the cycle and have not drank for a few days. Over the last few days (and probably the last few days of 2021 when I was drinking heavily) I’ve felt like I’m not feeling much libido, sex drive, or really desire for intimacy with my girlfriend. If anything, I feel like I don’t want to be sharing emotional or physical intimacy, from cuddling and romantically talking to sex. As someone with some other mental health issues, my obsessive and anxious mind is jumping to other reasons I feel this way. I did do research online about possible alcohol withdrawal symptoms but couldn’t find a lot of clarity. So my question is, is it common or expected to feel this disinterest in romantic closeness, arousal, and libido within just a few days of stopping drinking (and/or during a period of heavy drinking)?

A bit confused about ""why now?"", I thought about what changed in my life to trigger these concurrent and constant cravings. The large change came down to beginning a new antidepressant. I charted out my past with both antidepressant use (been off and on) and heavy binge drinking / chain smoking periods of my life, and they also correlate well.

Has anyone else encountered this scenario where taking antidepressants increases such cravings? Can anyone, esp those with a medical background, explain this? 

Side note -- I've avoided smoking and drinking and will continue to. I actually tried non-alcoholic wine for the first time and it helped me move past the cravings for the past couple  days. It helped fill in the hole left from not drinking  during new years eve.

I've been drinking 13% ABV Chardonnay daily for about 3 years. My average for the last 2 years has been 4 or 5 bottles a day. My alcohol consumption is mostly on an empty stomach. I've woken up and slammed a bottle for breakfast every day for 18 months. I then sip sporadically, fasting each day until dinner, with only wine and water getting inside. 

Bottom line is that 90% of my drinking is acute and on an empty stomach. I keep being told I don't have the *time* under my belt to warrant a liver ultrasound, but I've always drank a very specific way; where the alcohol hits heavy, hard and fast. I just spent the New Year period in hospital because I started puking ""coffee ground vomitus"" (as they called it) all over my bed, then later had a seizure in the emergency ward and landed in the ICU because of a 215/153 BP + incoherence.

I can't get a Liver ultrasound for at least a month at best and the endoscopy will have to wait even longer. It's been a week since my last drink (the hospital opted to keep me in to prevent more detox complications) and with sobriety I can now tell I've genuinely trashed my body.

I guess my real question is whether or not it's possible to do permanent, irreversible damage in only 3 years of true alcoholism. Is there a surefire way of convincing my GPs that my liver health is a worthwhile investigation when they've just recently brushed off my concerns? Life has been a blur for so long and it's only now I'm stressed about the condition of my liver and other organs + I'm kind of in panic-mode atm. If I shouldn't be worried just tell me that lol but I'm very anxious over the idea I've unalterably harmed myself through indifference and stupidity.",42,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990501999855042}"

2022-01-02 21:53:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/rur21k/husband_and_trust/,Husband and trust,"This is my first time posting anything on Reddit... 
my husband is a long time drinker. Always with family, always with a six pack or two.  We both come from alcoholism in our family and when we met, we were casual drinkers. Or so I thought... we moved in together rather quickly and I noticed the level of his drinking right away. Whiskey and vodka bottles would be gone within days of opening. I have some past relationship issues with drinking and so this was very concerning for me. In the beginning our communication was great and he agreed the hard liquor did not need to be In the house or at all. Beer and wine only. There were many times I had a gut instinct he was drinking more than he led on to be. I caught him a few times when he accidentally would leave mini alcohol bottles lying around his or my car or jacket pockets while in the wash. After these instances, he’d confess the next sober day and slow the drinking for a few days and we would repeat the cycle in another month or two. These events have eliminated any trust I have in him in regards of his drinking. 
Drinking every night got old for me after our wedding. We wanted a child so I almost eliminated alcohol all together. Finally after 2 years trying, we got pregnant and my husbands drinking lightened up. That is until our little baby was born. He took off 2 months of work to be with me as I healed from c section. As we were both learning how to become parents, he began experiencing postpartum and began drinking every night again. Only this time we were together with a fussy newborn everyday 24/7. He began hiding his drinking once more. He would go get formula or dinner and come back red faced and incoherent. After continuing to deny it he’d eventually pass out on the couch and then fess up the next day. My anxiety and trauma got so bad during this time but I needed to heal and bond with my child before I returned to work. There is still very little trust. 
We are both back to work now. After a horrible drinking night a few months ago, I left with our baby after he kept on calling me names and twisting the metaphorical knife. He knew where I was and left me alone until my return with our baby a few days later. He decided then that he needed to stop drinking until he can control it. He wants to be present and experience our baby’s firsts. It’s been 1.5 months and he’s had 2 lapses. Tonight, he has come home from the store with tea but he is slurring, lethargic and his face is red. I know this sign. I’ve seen it numerous times before. This time he is not fessing you to it. He refuses to tell me because (I’m guessing) he does not want me to leave with our baby like I did during a lapse.  
I’m scared because my gut and heart are saying one thing but the evidence is there. He does not want to stop drinking, I know this. He is now talking about how horrible his life is and that he hates me and himself. He refuses to get help from AA, therapy, or discussing his issues with anyone, even me. He passed out now, baby is asleep. I’m a mess... I don’t trust him. I want to help him but I can’t.

I’m trying AA (no judgement about anyone who chooses not to). There have been a lot of great things but some things about AA bother me. I also posted in the AA sub, but I would like to hear opinions of people who aren’t going to automatically defend the program. 

Here’s one thing that’s been bothering me— 

We are told that if we don’t keep actively working the program, we are dangerously stepping closer and closer to a relapse. We have to keep working all 3 sides of the triangle, stay in the center, live step 10.

This is confirmed by many who have relapsed. They let their lives slip away from the program, relapsed, and are now back to continue doing the work, and to warn others what might happen if you ever stop. 

What about the people who stopped “doing the work” but didn’t relapse? We would never hear from them because, without a relapse, there’s nothing bringing them back to AA to tell the tale.

It’s circular logic that we are told we will relapse if we leave, because the only ones telling us about leaving are the ones who CAME BACK. What about people who slowly distanced over time and who’s lives are not in shambles as a result?

The only acknowledgement I have heard of this from people in AA is that, well, those people must not have been “real alcoholics.” I do not think this is true at all. I think it’s a little dangerous to gate-keep the legitimacy of addiction— to say that if you’re a “real” addict, you’re only hope is AA. And if you can survive without AA, you’re not a “real” addict. 

All this being said, I do not take relapse stories lightly. Im not turning up my nose to the advice about “doing the work.” I am genuinely scared that if I stop doing the work, if I slip from the program, that I may relapse again. And it bothers me that AA has to instill this fear in people. What happened to, “take what you need, leave the rest?”

Through a very long lockdown I was drinking alone every night but didn’t acknowledge the harm as I thought I wasn’t hurting anyone. Now that life has opened back up again, there have already been numerous occasions where I have gotten too drunk and caused harm to myself and others.  The final straw was when I got super drunk and hit on my sister’s partner. I had no recollection of the event and was mortified when she told me. Thankfully she was forgiving and more concerned about me but I am sick of needing people’s forgiveness.  I have finally acknowledged that I cannot moderate and have an incredibly unhealthy relationship with alcohol and cannot have it in my life.  Tbh I feel relieved, in the back of my mind (I’m a very avoidant person) I have been so scared about my drinking but now that I’ve honestly acknowledged the problem I feel hopeful. 

Ive done a year of sobriety in the past and it was the best year of my adult life.  It was a year where I wasn’t soaked in shame and could actually rely on myself. I felt powerful and proud of who I was.

Our daughter is 22 and has twin 18-month old boys. We have taken over care for them but she still has legal custody.

We just feel bent over a barrel in terms of not enabling her addiction. If we cut off financial support, she’s shown us that she will prioritize drinking and smoking over proper care of the boys.

But if we take on the responsibility, she has the time/money/freedom of responsibility to just go on a bender every day.

The added difficulty is that she’s still in the process of finalizing custody with the twins’ “father”, (I use quotation marks because he’s had very little involvement and is a drug dealer and drug abuser). Our concern is that letting it get to a point where Child Services is involved will give him an opportunity to try and get custody. Not to mention that our daughter isn’t so far gone in her addiction that she couldn’t pull herself together long enough to convince Child Services she’s competent and then cut us off completely.

She’s on a wait list for a detox program, and says she wants to go to a woman’s rehab clinic after that. But she’s talked the talk before and has a history of failing to go through with things.

I am just wondering if there’s a good way to deal with this situation and get her the help and support she needs while at the same time keeping the boys safe, and giving us the sense of security that she can’t just “feel good at the time” and come and take the boys back then we get a call later that night where she’s drunk and we need to go back and get the boys.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9949357509613037}"
