I really need someone to talk to. I'm detoxing atm (although I'm through the worst of it) and I need someone to talk to about this crap when I want to drink. 

I don't want to be drunk, I just want the pain to go away. And when I drink it numbs my constant anxiety. It's the only time I don't feel like I have a rock in my stomach. Unfortunately it isn't possible for me to moderate myself and the amount creeps up.


I've had 3 month or few weeks before but every time I just want to feel happy again. Or at least not in pain.

And so begins the slope. I'm two days ""sober"" except 3 shots at night for insomnia. Is there anyone who can be a message buddy until  I can get to AA?",12,0

I felt like there are alcohols in my fridge and I have to drink them. it was like a torture to my self. I feel like I vomit but I keep drink. Like this is something that I should do. Beer on my table looks me like ""you don't enjoy it but you should do, you should drink me"". But today I poured my last beer to sink. I feel nice. Like I cut off the piece that hurts me. For this 1 month of alcohol abuse I almost did not drink water for 6 days in a row. My kidneys were hurting.  I started to clean myself now. I am hopeful ☺",13,0

I have a friend that I care about immensely who is Russian. He’s in Moscow now and was offered entry to an alcohol addiction center free of charge. The problem is, he’s gay and the condition is that he must allow them to perform a sexual conversion therapy on him - essentially to turn him straight. 

I know the LGBT acceptance in Russia is complicated at best, but scientifically, conversion therapy is considered cruel and unusual and is illegal in many places. I don’t want him to go to that kind of place, especially since it is proven to do more harm than good. Statistically, people who undergo sexual identity conversion therapy are twice as likely to attempt or commit suicide.

They keep telling him that in order to break the addiction, they must break down all of him - including his sexuality. I don’t agree with this. He has also been injected with something that makes him not want alcohol for the next 3 years. I didn’t get the full details or understanding about this, but it’s something that goes into his marrow. 

I want to save my friend - he means a lot to me. I want him to get the help he needs, but not like this. He deserves better. 

Does anyone have any guidance on Alcoholics Anonymous type groups in Russia that are not religion based and that will not try to convert him to become straight? 

I want to try and send him to some websites that maybe are in Russian that he can read up on. 

Thanks for any help and guidance here, I know it’s a bit of a stretch considering the topic but I want to help him.",2,0

My dad died Jan 2021 from liver failure. I care for my mom who is incredibly disabled due to issues stemming from a stroke and subsequent alcoholism. 

Now the person I thought was the love of my life, who was beside me in my dad's final days, who has seen my mom go through the worst parts of addiction, is in the hospital from alcohol withdrawal. He had a seizure. This isn't the first time he's quit drinking and had a seizure, but it's the first time his family has gotten involved. He's unemployed. Luckily he has a good family that is willing to help him with anything, but I am the one who has to live with him. 

He has agreed to quit drinking but he refuses to see a therapist or get any sort of professional help. He gets incredibly defensive when its brought up. I am not trying very hard to be sympathetic. I am still not over my dad's death. I loved my dad deeply despite his drinking, and I am bitter that he died such a painful death. My bf knows all about my parents, my childhood, and still somehow went down the same path. I know its an addiction, and addiction is a disease, but I will not lie: I am livid beyond measure. I am hurt, and I feel deeply and irreparably betrayed. 

As a child of alcoholics, specifically alcoholics who tried to get better time and time again but always failed, I know this cycle intimately. And now I'm stuck in it again. It makes my head spin. I could leave, but he is still my friend before all else. I want to see him get better because for once in my life I want to see what that looks like...to get better from this fucking awful addiction. 

But here is my fear: he won't want to recognize that he has an addiction and therefore a few months from now when he thinks he's good, he's going to have one beer with dinner. and that beer will turn into a few beers. and then he'll go back to liquor. and then he'll realize he's dependent and try to stop leading to another bout of withdrawal. 

I just don't know what to do.",11,0

He was never physical for emotionally abusive to me, my siblings, or my mom. I saw him drink, but never drunk. However, even when I was young and unaware of what was really going on, I could always tell when my parents were going through a rough patch. 2 years ago my dad came clean to my siblings and I about what he was dealing with, and said he was going to start to go to AA. I felt so sad for him but I was so happy he was making the steps to get help. However, shortly thereafter I moved out- and wasn’t around to know if everything was still going well with him/ my mom and him. I thought everything was getting better, my parents seemed happy and I never saw any beer cans hidden within the house when I came to visit. Over Thanksgiving, my mom and siblings and I went out of town. My dad couldn’t come because he couldn’t get the time off work. I had a gut feeling he was going to get drunk, but I pushed it aside thinking he had changed. We facetimed him on Thanksgiving and I could just tell. I knew he was drunk and I went into the bathroom and cried. I texted him asking if he was and he said he wasn’t, so I thought that I had just been mistaking. But when we got back, my dad sat us down and started crying and told us that he had gotten drunk and had hurt himself accidentally in the process. He fell and messed up his face and hands badly. This is such heartbreaking news, because every time it’s “i just need one more chance”. I want to believe him, because my dad is the most amazing human and he is so strong and can beat this if he doesn’t give up. But it’s been “one more time” so many times. I’m just scared.  don’t know what the point of this post is. I just needed to vent.",2,0

I'm scared of myself when I drink. I always lie to my boyfriend and just don't come home. Usually this results in me calling him intoxicated so obviously he figures out whats going on. When I'm sober I call him and he cries and says ""are you going to come home to me?"" 

Fuck. This tears, the saddness in his voice, the way he says that, kills me everytime. I hope to stop drinking for good and stop hurting him. I hate that he thinks I wont come back and leave him for alcohol.",1,0

I’ve been a semi-heavy drinker for several months (I’m newly 21 as of this fall) and once i moved to a new state, i have been drunk every single night (save for a few during which i was traveling) since i moved in to a new place, which has been just over a month ago. i drink with my roommate ever night after work, who i guess if you think about it, has the same problem I do (but believe me, this has been a problem 6+ months in the works)

I wish i didn’t have this dependence but at the same time i can’t imagine not drinking at the frequency i do. i feel like it keeps me sane. at the same time though, i’m pretty sure it has been the trigger of a few panic attacks recently. anyway, i can’t picture myself quitting or even moderating, mainly because i function really well even with my alcohol intake (i guess one might call me a functioning alcoholic?). i go to work every morning, get my shit done, my boss is thrilled with me… but i drink and drink and drink every night when i get home.

I am not an alcoholic, but I have two in my life that are close to me. One is a friend and the other is my brother.

They are both quite ""bad"" alcoholics. The friend is somewhat functioning, but my brother is incredibly low functioning. If it weren't for the support of my parents he would be one of those crazed, soiled-in-his-own-waste, chronically homeless people if he was alive at all (he gets life-threatening withdrawal symptoms). I suspect both may have some amount of brain damage because neither of them seems to be the person they used to be even when sober for extended periods. My brother confabulates a lot in particular which makes me wonder if he has mild Korsakoff's.

Anyway, they both have very different personalities, but one way in which they are practically identical is they are both obsessed with their pasts. They are constantly fixated on their history (especially their teenage years - they are now thirty-ish) and traumas. This is especially true when they've been drinking.

I can't emphasize enough how fixated they become. It seems to be all they become capable of thinking about. I'm not writing this because of how it affects me, but even as a person who loves them and holds a great deal of patience it gets to the point where I'm annoyed to hear them tell the same story, unprompted, for the 100th time.

I can try to steer the conversation in a different direction, but invariably they'll drag us back to their favorite stories about why their life is in such a bad state now.

I'm not seeking sympathy or advice because it doesn't really affect me too much and, frankly, i don't hold much hope for either of these people. Neither has shown any real desire to change. What I'm wondering is how common this is and if others have experienced it. Is there something about alcoholism that makes this likely to happen, or is it just coincidence that they're both like this?

Thanks for reading and your thoughts.",0,0

It was a co-worker’s birthday and we were all in a bar. Nobody knew I had concretely decided to stay sober since the last time we drank. I’ve always brought it up casually and lightly in jokes Because I was too embarrassed to fully admit and say that I had a problem. Fast forward to the bar, they were all thinking of splitting a cocktail tower and i told them i don’t drink anymore and they all kept pressuring me and throwing tasteless jokes at me until i gave in and said fuck it i can always start the clock again.  


I grew up overseas and came back to my birth country to serve my 2 years of mandatory military service. I’ve spent a whole year here and I still can’t find people I can relate to or trust. The co-workers I hang out with from the unit only know the surface level of me and I hang out with them cause there’s nothing else waiting for me at home ya know, plus I’m kinda stuck with them until my service is done. They’re shallow and sheltered individuals who do not share the past I do.

 I know it’s really fucked up to say but I see them as placeholders. They’re kinda just there until I can find a better group of people to hang with. And for a good reason too,  these guys are genuine assholes but I’m stuck with them. so it makes it even more frustrating and embarrassing to hand them another reason to belittle and humiliate me 

I wanted to stop drinking cause every time I do I make a goddamn fool of myself. a total and utter embarrassment that would be the talk of the town all week. My behavior and actions were the absolute complete opposite of who I am when I’m sober, don’t even get me started on the drunk texts. I become the “hey look at me “ guy. I become the person you point at with your friends and laugh at not with. And the morning after i am faced with regret and shame. And what hurts the most is the “oh my god remember what you did??” Those words sear and banish me into a pit of shame. 

Before i came back to my birth country i was drinking every day but i was by myself. I had some unresolved trauma and pain that i was not ready to deal with. Back then I didn’t consider it a problem. I was just being a kid ya know? i didn’t know that having 3 cans of room temperature beer and a stale cigarette for breakfast was a big deal or the fact that i had a mountain of empty whisky bottles hidden in my closet. It wasn’t until I went to see a therapist, she broke it down for me and that’s when I acknowledged that I had a drinking problem.  


I was sober for 6months until last night. and the fucking guilt and shame is tearing me apart. i can’t describe it it’s like anxiety and depression mixed with some other form of panic. I want to run from this feeling but the feeling is inside me and i can’t run away from my own brain. I am embarrassed and scared to face my co-workers on Monday. But most importantly i am ashamed of letting my friends down overseas. The people i call family, know about my drinking problem and have had to deal with my bullshit for the better part of a year, and i had just promised them 6 months ago that i would be sober for good. 

The fucking feeling of guilt and shame is searing harder than it’s ever seared before and i don’t know what to do, i don’t know how to make it stop and that’s why I’m making this post.  I’ve been listening to podcasts about relapsing and tried googling for shit but none of them are working. If there’s anyone out there that has advice or just anything to help stop this fucking feeling I’d appreciate the help.  


TLDR; I’ve relapsed after 6 months of sobriety and the shame and guilt is killing me and i need to make it stop",8,0

Just wanted to share.","I started drinking when I was 17, I’m 30 now. The lockdown and the following months were the worst of it by far, but I actually feel like I’m doing better now and I can get out of this. Being in lockdown was a great excuse to drink almost every day with my roommates and girlfriend at the time. But when it was time to go back to work and university classes, I continued the habit. I would drink almost everyday, unless I got so drunk that I was feeling too sick the next day to drink again. I drank to feel happy, help me sleep, and get rid of stress. And I think the fact that it was so fun during quarantine made me uncertain of what I would be if I quit it. 
I put on unhealthy weight - I wasn’t really exercising much prior to quarantine, but was in pretty good shape still. Went from about 155 lbs to 175. 
I was just drinking out of boredom. It was really hard for me to just have a few drinks and stop - once I started I’d almost always have to keep going until I woke up the morning after blacking out. I did and said very stupid things when I would blackout, and ultimately alcohol led to the end of my relationship.
For the past few months now I’ve gradually reduced my drinking while increasing my exercise, and keeping with a healthy diet. The best part is how euphoric and less depressed I feel after achieving a really good workout. I still get tipsy maybe once or twice a week, but it feels like a greater incentive to not drink because it would interfere with my fitness progress. I’m back down to about 157 lbs now and I’m excited to start putting on more muscle once I lose all the alcohol fat. The worst part for me is that I have insomnia now when I’m sober, but I sleep amazingly on nights where I drink even a little bit. I’m hoping this is just part of withdrawal and I’ll continue getting back to being a normal healthy person, able to sleep regularly again.
Anyway thanks for reading. I don’t really have any questions, just wanted to say hi and share a little bit about my recent experiences with alcohol and where I’m at now.",3,4

They are a lovey person and I am very comitted to them, but they’re an alcoholic. When we first got together I was going through some drinking problems as well related to the death of my father. They were open and honest with me about their alcohol abuse when we met, and although it was difficult in the beginning I was able to help them gradually decrease their drinking over time, from drinking heavily wvery day to only drinking a few times a week. This wasn’t enough though and there have been incidents where they have gotten completely shitfaced and caused me a lot of personal distress. I have extreme anxiety around drunk people which usually leads to me drinking as well, as of writing this I’m three weeks completely sober and don’t plan on changing that. I ended up drawing a line and forbidding them from bringing alcohol to my house or drinking around me. This seemed to work for a while but today we were supposed to get together after they got off work. After an hour or so of no word from them I got anxious and asked them if they were drinking. Yup. They went out drinkig after work with a coworker. For my own sake I told them not to come over if they had been drinking. I’m disappointed and very torn. I don’t want to break up with them, but it hurts me when they decide to choose drinking over spending time with me. They’ve tried detox centers/rehab before and don’t want to go again because of negative experiences. They’re not delusional, they admit they have a drinking problem and are making steps in the right direction, but it hasn’t been enough. Is this relationship a lost cause? How can I get through to them? Would an intervention help or just make things worse?

(for the most part)","Hey everyone! 22F college student. Came home on Wednesday for Thanksgiving, and haven’t had a drop of alcohol since Tuesday night. No withdrawal symptoms either! I brought a few cans of some Twisted Tea in my backpack just in case, but so far every night I’ve just not felt the urge to drink them. Sometimes I want to, then I immediately think “I actually don’t care enough to waste these cans on tonight when I could just take a shower and go to sleep instead.” 

Feeling real proud of myself honestly. I’ve been drinking for about 2 1/2 years, honestly not a whole lot in comparison to most people but I still realized I was relying on the drink too much, made my anxiety worse which made the drinking worse, COVID hit and made both of those things even worse, and I was missing out on a lot of stuff due to either feeling hungover or too anxious to leave my house. About a week and a half ago I went to get my usual 3 24oz cans of 8% seltzer and they didn’t have any. I decided to pick up some 5% Twisted Tea instead. Since then I’ve just gone with that instead. Tapered down from 3-4 cans a night to 1/2 can in about a week, then traveled home and suddenly I don’t really care to drink what I brought with me. I know it’s only been 4 days, but mentally I feel so much better, freer, more money in my bank account, less stress of thinking “I have to do ____ tomorrow, but what if I’m hungover”, etc. Feeling really proud of myself.

I (34F) have a friend (33F) coming over on New Years Eve to binge-watch the new season of our favorite TV show. She lives in the next state over, so we don't get to see each other that often, making our visits pretty special. However, she is a definite (and self-acknowledged) alcoholic. She very, *very* frequently expresses regrets about her more-or-less daily drinking habit. She very badly wants to stop drinking but hasn't been successful, and I know her drinking leads to a lot of self-loathing.

Both the fact that it's New Years Eve, AND the fact that our favorite show is coming back, register as ""occasions"" to drink - and other under circumstances, they would be! Every other hangout we've ever had, drinking does occur at some point, though I myself am not *that* much of a drinker. I told her I'm planning on us watching the show sober, and on us having a sober NYE, but I can tell she's feeling anxious and less-than-psyched about that. Also maybe a little ashamed and a little defensive.

It's not like one or two sober nights/days are going to make any difference in her overall sobriety. Am I being insistent for nothing, or am I being a good, supportive friend? Should I set up a sober atmosphere but, if she decides to go out and buy drinks, just let that happen because I'm not the boss of her? For the record, she isn't disruptive at all when she's drinking. She's not mean or sloppy or anything like that. This is solely, 100% for her benefit. It's just that she expresses concerns about her own alcoholism so often, that like just casually drinking with her (or facilitating an environment in which she will drink) makes me feel like I'm being a bad friend and doing something quite harmful, even though it's her choice.

So I guess my question is how assertive and insistent SHOULD I be about this? If I'm cool about getting drinks, am I enabling her? But if I'm NOT cool about it, am I overstepping my bounds on her autonomy as an adult who is entitled to make her own choices?

Note: I have asked the general advice subreddit about this, but it occurred to me that feedback from drinkers might be more valuable. Thanks in advance!",9,0

My life was objectively better when I was sober, but I also found it incredibly boring.","The paradox of sobriety for me is this; in order to be happier, I need to be healthy and either not drink at all, or drink moderately.  The problem is that I love being drunk, so it's very difficult for me to keep a handle on it once I start.  

So, anyways, say I'm healthy and working out and not drinking...after several months, I'll have lost weight, gotten more organized, my mental acuity is much more refined, etc.  But then, with my improved brain chemistry and energy....I get bored more easily, and I get hyper critical and fussy and I want to drink to be able to enjoy things.  Case in point, when I am sober, I don't watch movies or shows, because I find them stupid, and I don't have emotional interest in the stories.  When I am drinking, I love movies and shows.  Even if the show isn't that good, I can still watch it. 

Although I'm an objectively better guitar player when sober, I feel the music far more when I drink, and am a better composer when under the influence.  

What I'm saying is that alcohol is not all bad.  Sometimes it can be absolutely awesome.  Most of the best moments of my life have been when I was drinking.  I don't want to have to leave alcohol behind forever, as I find sober people....tedious and self-righteous.  I don't want to be one of those kale-smoothie drinking, self-congratulatory yuppie types that are so typical in the reformed-alcoholic sphere.  

I guess I am just posting this because I am at a cross roads with my own drinking, and wonder if any of you have advice that isn't just, ""Don't ever drink again.  Life is always better when sober"" etc.  For me, it's more complicated than that.  Life is better in some ways when sober, but also not as good at the same time.  That's what I find, anyway.  

I am neither encouraging people to drink or to go sober.  I am just venting a bit here in the hopes that someone can hit me with some insights into this issue that I haven't already mulled over.

My experience","A bit of background: as of about 6 months ago, my SO and I were drinking 1/2-3/4 of a 1.75L handle of vodka per night. Sometimes more. This went on for probably 2 years and I’m quite petite. I know it’s a bit unreasonable, but I really think my binge drinking happened out of nowhere. I didn’t drink much or often beforehand. 

Well the inevitable happened when I tried to quit…auditory hallucinations, shaking, sweating, violent vivid nightmares. Then boom, seizure. Thankfully I hadn’t damaged my liver somehow. Had a few days in hospital. I committed to a full month of sobriety after that nightmare successfully. Followed by a bender…then a slightly longer stint of sobriety…and yet another bender. 

So the latest and longest bout of sobriety was about 2 months followed by a 4 day binge morning to blackout. I’ve been having vivid dreams (not violent nightmares) but no other WD symptoms *thankfully*. Every time I stop, the worst part is the anxiety of a potential seizure but okay so far. 

Anywho, back to day 3 and I know it’s a setback, but I’m still really proud. The sober times are getting longer and longer and those benders are getting much shorter. Plus, I made it through an alcohol fueled Thanksgiving! Literally every person around me drinking including my SO.

It seems like a lot on here struggle even drinking with friends or family but luckily that’s helped me moderate more if I’m being watched. Obviously if get to a certain level I find it hard to stop.

 I guess problem drinking comes in all different forms.",6,1

I'm afraid to talk about where I am now vs where I was and where I think I'm going or want to be.  


Why am I afraid? I'm afraid because shame is the fastest way back to the bottle for me, and every conversation I hear about this topic always makes me feel like such a worthless piece of shit with no power or self control. I want to feel empowered, I want to feel powerful. I want to walk away from a conversation about alcoholism feeling like a fucking champion because I'm kicking this things ass right now, even when I have a fuck it day and have a drink anyway I remind myself how strong I am and don't have another. When the voice rears its ugly little head and starts screaming DRINK at me I tell it to fuck off. I'll drink when I want to drink not when you want me to asshole, and I don't want to right now. Sure some days its hard, some days it feels like I'm a toddler about to go toe to toe in a death match ring vs a fucking polar bear, and other days I'm the goddamned polar bear.   


I demand nothing less of myself than victory in this, and I want to have a conversation about this that empowers that feeling no matter what I do. I am tired of hating myself. I am tired of being miserable all the time. I am tired of every thing on this topic treating me like I'm too fucking weak and stupid to control myself. FUCK YOU I'M IN CHARGE!  


But yeah. I'm in charge, but I'm scared to talk about it because years of struggling, years of fighting, years of reading, years of talking to people they all had that effect on me. They jaded me from quitting until I drank myself so sick I thought I was gonna die and I was a fucking moron for not going to the hospital that night and I'm still not ready to talk about it so don't ask. NOBODY who is struggling with addiction should face these emotions and I for one am sick of it. This may not be the way for everyone, but this is the way for me. This is what gave me success, but success is becoming lonely because as soon as I start looking for someone to talk to its right back to ""oh you're so weak and powerless"" and I'm over here like ""Do you want me to drink again? Because that's how you fucking make that happen!""  


Thank you for your time, sorry for all the swearing, but I had to get it out there to someone, anyone. I just don't want to feel like I can't talk to anyone anymore without being sent into a downward spiral of  shame and guilt.",1,0

Well, it's the holidays. Most of us are either with our family and trying staying sober or without our family trying to stay sober. It can be a tough time for us alcoholics. In my case,  I'm seeing family I haven't seen in 6 or 7. They know I'm in recovery but I don't know how much they know. I just saw some of them and was super nervous about what to say when the dreaded question came up of, ""what have you been up to?"". My sister told me to answer honestly, so I did. I told my cousin about how I'm living in a sober house and I go to AA meetings and I'm in outpatient 5 days a week. He nodded along and said, ""that's good, that's great news"" but I was nervous the whole time. 

I'm embarrassed. I feel like a fucking freak. Like some weird loser sick person. I feel pathetic. I feel very unsure about myself. People in AA say that over time they have no trouble sharing the embarrassing nature of their lives. It's not embarrassing, and it shouldn't be embarrassing to me, but it is. I really feel like drinking now because I have to live with these thoughts and emotions for the next few days until I can go home.

I won't drink. I know I won't. I'm just trying to look forward to the future when this type of situation will be less difficult for me. I'm so used to running away from my emotions and numbing them with substances. I have to face them now and deal with them which is new to me. If I just keep doing the right thing, it should all fall into place. I'm just gonna breathe and enjoy my family. 

I hope everyone else has a successful and sober holiday. If anyone is having trouble you can pm me. Stay strong!",14,0

Myself and another mutual friend have attempted to help but on reflection this may have only made things worse (stopping the person from failing/ getting into serious trouble seems to have emboldened them/ deluded them to some degree). 

Weve had the talk and the strange thing is my friend agrees with everything we say — depending on the day that is.

I could go on, but what I’m wondering specifically is is it worth perhaps reaching across to his family to see their views on the matter are? I don’t want it to come across as some sort of betrayal or going behind his back — it’s out of concern and a hopelessness that everything else has been tried.

Has anyone who has been in my friends situation experienced this? What was your reaction? I’m guessing for your friends to approach your parents that must have signified the love of concern is great.

I've been to rehab like 5 times in the last 2 years. Drinking until I want to die. Take benzos. Fall back.

I've stopped again 1st September 2021. Started again November 10th 2021.

I can't do this vicious circle anymore. It's either suffering because I drink or suffering because I have to be abstinent. Or suffering because I have to stay in between of abstinence and abuse.

I don't feel like I can find the energy to stop again. I'm on antidepressants, and nobody in my family knows how fucking miserable I feel. 

I've tried, I've honestly tried. I have underlying problems or ""demons"", but I can't fight them. I suffer so much whenever I do something. I had to take a 2 hour drive and I've suffered so much. I wanted to go to university to give it a try. 2 hours were so much suffering.

I don't see a way out I just hope I could lay in bed all day, not needing anything. It's been 2 years since I thought things couldn't get any worse. I fought it, it didn't really get worse, but it didn't really get better.

I have lost the last % of hope I have had. How many times do I have to quit alcohol and fix my life?

I feel like I'll never get out of this hellish existence.

I can't even commit suicide because I'd hurt my family too much.

They don't get why lay in bed all day and I don't want to tell them why. I don't want them to know how much I suffery because they'd suffer too then.

My brother had an issue with it as well but we drank differently. He was the drink after waking up and throughout the the day type. The only reason I mention this is because he had to go to the ER a couple times because he didn't drink and that lead to seizures.

I have been absolutely terrified that if I quit, I'll have the same outcome and I'm also terrified of the medical bills if I go to the doctor or rehab.  

I do not drink during the day. I am very functional at work, I take care of my bills and rent. However when the day is over... I generally drink on average 4 shots of vodka per night.  Sometimes a few more on weekends. I'm 6' 4"" and around 200 lbs if that means anything. 

I know it's bad. I hate that I lean on it and I hate that I'm addicted. The guilt and the knowledge that I'm fucking my body up and not dealing with things properly is hell on a daily basis. 

My question to you all is... At an average of 4 drinks per night for the last 5 years.... Am I in danger of lethal withdrawals if I quit cold turkey or even try to take a few days off? I heard multiple takes online and I know things are different from person to person but I'm just curious what people's experience has been. I don't want to die while trying to get off the lick, but I'm also terrified to go broke/take time off work to go to rehab. I know this is irrational... I get it. I'm just looking for some input from people who have been in this spot or know people who have been. 

To be clear... I know there are psychological issues behind any addiction. However, my main fear, focus and question is... Is it physically safe to quit after such a long period without landing in the hospital.

I met a woman on Tinder in May 2021, certainly different than the type I was used to being involved with. Granola girl, dreads, earthy, and a bit feral. I really enjoyed that about her. She liked to dig in the dirt. The first time we met in person I was confused/shocked by her behavior. I didn't know if she was intoxicated or just forward and goofy. I gave her the benefit of the doubt...

Aside from the initial meeting, I discovered small indicators along the way that pointed to the fact she has a problem with alcohol. The backside of her yard is lined with upside-down Skyy vodka bottles. Probably 50 of them. The garage has many additional empties. 

She always smells like metabolized alcohol and carries an insulated, stainless mug around with her. I assumed it was filled with booze, which I later was able to confirm. I don't know why I continued to not address this and carry on as normal. It's not normal. 

There are too many smaller instances to note here. A few of the bigger ones are that I rescued her from a flat tire, which turns out when I got there that she hit something and destroyed the rim too. She was sitting on the ground in a gravel lot, in her work attire not knowing how to change a tire. She was wasted, driving home from her job.

Approximately a week ago she expressed interest in attending an event with me associated with a hobby I'm involved in. She is off work at 6 pm and I agreed to pick her up at 7 pm. When she got in my car I tried speaking to her and it was similar to having a conversation with a stroke victim. It was that bad. She once again was drinking at her job. It's beyond me how she is able to maintain or not be noticed by other staff in that condition. Needless to say, I turned around and took her home. It ruined my night. There was no use in lecturing or scolding. I just put her in bed and left. 

I was raised in a household with an abusive, narcissistic, alcoholic father. I struggle with many issues because of it. I know I can't save her and she needs to do it for herself. I feel defeated, sad, failed disappointed, etc. I've never been involved with someone that is on this level of alcoholism. 

Her family and friends don't say anything to her about it. I reached out to one of her good female friends about it last night and she was thankful I said something and she has been feeling similar. I've been working on establishing boundaries in order to protect myself and I think I'm doing the right thing, but it hurts. 

The alcoholism killed my desire to maintain a romantic relationship with her. I don't want to have sleepovers, I don't want to be sexual and she took great offense to this when I told her. This is what makes me feel the worst. Like I should still be attracted to her when she can't make a sound decision to save her life and is a slobbering fool. 

I just needed somewhere to vent, to a bunch of internet strangers. It's difficult to summarize all that has happened and convey the gravity or how bad it is. As I re-read this, it doesn't seem as bad as it really is. Probation, court-assigned AA meetings, in-patient detox treatment, etc. She's been through it. I understand the addict brain but I don't relate. I have enough emotional literacy to empathize with the sickness it is. 

Any supportive words are appreciated.",65,0

Last Wendesday, I remember I was at the club with my friends, really having fun and I just kept drinking, no sure why I guess I just wanted the night to get more fun. The last thing I remembered was at 2:30 roughly. Then, apparently I left my friends (I assume either kicked out the club or left myself) and tried going home. The scary thing is, I never made it home and there are 2 hours when I was walking around a city im unfamiliar with by myself at 3/4am that I have 0 memory of at all. I assume I was falling over everywhere and in hindsight was probably developing hypothermia. I ""clocked back in"" and regained consciousness at around 4:15am I think and realised the state I was in, and went to random house to ask help. The people who lived there were lovely and took me home but I had no idea where I was and was covered in blood and mud from falling over everywhere (looking back, I was also probably concussed). When I woke up the next morning, I was covered in grazes and bruises and had chipped one of my teeth. 

What scares me the most about this is that this is probably one of the ideal scenarios of that situation and i was probably very lucky. I could've fallen asleep outside after walking around or someone taken advantage of me while I was in that state and robbed me. The people at the house I decided to knock on could've done what most people would do at 4/5am and ignore me and if that happend I have no idea what I would've done drunk, with no usable phone and no clue where I was. I've thought about it alot. I very easily could've become another statistic and the fact I so willingly left the safety of the club/my friends is so out of character. If something terrible did happen to me that night I can't even think about how my parents (who im very close too) would feel. It's changed my opinion of alcohol completely and even though all my friends drink every weekend I don't think I could ever again after it put me in such a dangerous situation. Unfortunately alcohol is unavoidable in UK university culture so I'm not sure how I'm going to balance it all.",23,0

I'm almost three months sober from alcohol. I quit cold turkey one day, haven't had any cravings (despite being depressed while looking at the wine we sell at work lol), and I feel very inspired and lucky to have been freed. Before that I was drinking at least one 24oz beer or two big glasses of wine almost every night. Couldn't resist the cravings. I felt free after giving it up, and I plan to go a year and see how I feel.

But here's the thing. I randomly thought it might be fun to try some O'Douls, since I havent had it since I was a kid (my dad bought me some from a gas station once, pretty funny). I really enjoyed it, but I didn't expect to get drunk. I had two 12oz bottles, and that was it. It was relaxing, and familiar, but I didn't NEED to get drunk. Then I realized, maybe the buzz is just a bonus? 

I do like getting drunk, but just a little. Like a strong buzz but that's it, because I don't want to be stumbling all over and blacking out, and I hate hangovers. I look at these posts on the sub and I never felt that way. But still, I like a good buzz.

Though if I can get by with non-alcoholic beer, am I really an alcoholic? Or do I just like hops? I have no idea, since before my sobriety I couldn't go a day without a beer. Because I'm thinking I might have more control than I used to, and maybe I could just drink a real beer/wine once a month. Or is that playing with fire?

My ex partner (together for 3 1/2 years, broke up April this year) has always struggled with alcohol excess. It came to a head at the start of this year when I had to take him to hospital with possible withdrawal symptoms, and I gave him the ultimatum that he either got help, or I would leave. He chose alcohol. It was a very difficult break up, but after a month, he finally decided to join AA and get support. He's been six months sober and I've been doing my best to support him as a friend. (We're still on good terms with each other). He also has bipolar II disorder, which unfortunately makes him more susceptible to addiction, and has had some drug misuse issues in his past that he has managed to overcome. 

Today he rang me in absolute bits because he'd fallen off the wagon. He was so ashamed of himself. He told me he thought he had it 'under control' and could have one drink before realising that he really couldn't. He stopped himself from spiralling into a binge session, but has been suffering badly for it today (alcoholic gastritis). He has finally said that he needs to get sober for himself, not because I asked him to, or to get us back together (which was my initial fear when he started AA). 

I'm still incredibly proud of him for managing 6 months sober, and explained to him that recovery isn't linear and that he will have blips. He's going to contact his doctor tomorrow (who have been supporting him with his addiction problems in the past and present) but I guess I just would like to ask if there's anything more I can do to help him? 

I've been living with my sister this last 6 months so that I could do some soul searching about us and our future. I don't want to lose him from my life, even if a future romantic relationship between us is off the cards. He broke my trust and my heart, and I cannot put myself back in that position. But even if it's not 'romantic' love anymore, I still love and care for him deeply, and I want him to be well. After looking after him through some really difficult manic episodes, I promised him that whatever happened to us, I'd always be there for him, because the idea of him having to go through this alone is more than I can bear. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.",4,0

I always have a default drink on the weekend so breaking the habit can only be good thing. I'm going to set myself a goal to have at least one dry week and never drink more than 3 times in a month. Just hard over Christmas time I guess, I'll probably just not drink in the build up to Christmas to make up for that week. I don't know if this will help my goal or not, really I'm not bothered about drinking too many nights, more that I don't want to have any big binge nights, but I think maybe having these little resets might change my attitude when I do to out for a drink with friends. Maybe.... also, I have one of those perfect draft machines and I feel like that puts pressure on me to drink, I have 3 kegs at the moment, they only have 10ish pints in them so it's only like 2.5 pints a week but when I have that and going out it feels like too much, I'm tempted to sell it now but I do enjoy having it and never get too drunk in the house with it really.

I can’t base my life and my plans around his whims.  I need stability.  And it’s funny because what attracted me to him initially was this sense of power he exuded.  I see now that it is not power, but magnified ego.  He has no control over it.  He will let it destroy him, so what’s to say he won’t let it destroy me too?  I think I’ve answered my own question.  This sucks.  I am sad to lose him.  But he obviously isn’t sad to lose me because I’m just auxiliary to him, in his world.  I’m a means for him to continue his tirade.

""If they would give me benzos, I wouldn't resort to alcohol.  Just a tiny dose in my pocket just in case.""

To be fair, therapeutic meds absolutely do not work... compared to alcohol.  6 weeks to start gradually going from an 8 to a 6 or 5 and then eventually to a 3 is nothing compared to going from 8 to 0 in the liquor store parking lot.  The catch is that the quick relief will ruin your life... and then kill you.  And most of the time we've tried the boring meds, we have been either drinking frequently, in withdrawal with a higher baseline of anxiety, or in post-accute withdrawal with higher anxiety.  An SSRI isn't going to make us a cool customer until we are abstaining and done with PAWS.  And saying we will take 1 Ativan per day responsibly is like saying we will buy 30 mini bottles at the beginning of the month and drink 1 per day at most... how's that working out for us?

I’m an alcoholic, quite heavy one. I’m seeking treatment now and am already in therapy. So I know of disulfiram and how it works. I know of pills and I know of subdermal implants. That’s what I can find information on.

Here’s my question. What do you know of intravenous injections? Because I have this doctor, seems to be respectable practice, all credentials check out (I triple checked). He says that they can give an injection (or IV) with disulfiram or “disulfiram-like drug” and supposedly it will last for 12 months with effect. Supposedly it will be deposited in my organs slowly feeding in.

I suspect it to be fraud (worst) or placebo (best) because I can find no references to such method. Besides doc began to dodge questions when I asked him about the dosage and the specific medicine trademark.

May it be some other drug other than disulfiram?

I don't expect to achieve all 3 or any really, but felt it was necessary to mention my intentions 


I've been an alcoholic for 10+ years now, started mild then progressed to 2x 750ml bottles of spirits per day (or a similar equivalent for wine/beer), 7 days a week, dealt with withdrawals and got a bit better 


I'm drinking a lot less now, probably a bottle of wine 3-4 days per week (a bottle per day). I'm holding down a management level job, bills paid on time, saving for a deposit and everything is seemingly ok. I have good relationships with my partner, family and friends, however I'm still consuming copious amounts of alcohol, they're aware of this but accepting because shit was so much worse. I don't know how to stop


I've tried programs and I went to them sober then rewarded myself with booze. I can't socialise sober, or do much outside of work sober. I'm finding myself drinking out of habit...for example today was a good day, I felt relaxed, I cleaned, prepared dinner then got drunk (2 bottles of wine in 2 hours) for no reason except it was Friday 

Any advice on how to break this habit would be greatly appreciated

Also I live near 3 stores that sell booze and can get it delivered whenever... the ease of access doesn't help  as I have no self control

""Did my research "" online and it turns out I have cancer. It's always cancer online 🤣🤣🤣

KIDDING!!!

Went to my doctor and explained what's going on. He ordered a few tests. Apparently I have quite a few anomalies in my blood. The one he want to get looked at first is my liver. It's damaged pretty good apparently. 

My AST (sgot) level was pretty high. This test measures one of 2 liver enzymes in my blood. 

My ALT (Sgpt) level is more then DOUBLE what it should be. This enzyme helps convert food into energy. High levels of this enzyme is a sign the liver is injured and the enzymes are leaking out of the liver cells. 

Soooo this Sunday I am going to get an ultrasound of my liver and see how bad it is. 

Once the ultrasound is complete and I meet with my PCP, we will discuss THOSE results and the others he's found in the series of other tests. Like why is my blood pressure 143/110?

Why am I sharing this? Because I'm thankful I have the clarity of mind to get myself looked at. I'm thankful to care enough about myself and those who rely on me and my health. Thankful for those that care about me. Thankful for making myself and my family a priority and not a bottle.

My stepdad is in his early 50s and has been living separately from my mom for the past couple of years for work.

He was bleeding from everywhere within and his kidneys had given out. He told my mom he wanted to drink during his last days, and on the way home (long drive) he directed her to stop at several  liquor stores for several different liquors.

 So my dad was self medicating his anxiety and depression while on prescribed medication for both. I watched my dad get black out drunk every day, from ages 16-18 it was absolutely hell for me, my older brother moved out so it was now my turn to take over dealing with him. I hated him so much, I had to drive almost every night to get him from the bar (the bar is 4 houses down from us) but he was so drunk he couldn’t walk home. He was ignorant towards all of us. I screamed at him multiple times calling him all sorts of names because I knew he’d never remember them in the morning. I had to physically go into the bar to get him out at the age of 17, I was told by the bartender I needed to get out of the bar, I was so close to reporting him for over serving my dad every night but I didn’t and to this day I wish I did. I’ve been apart of the family with an alcoholic and I will never forgive him for not being there for me. His anxiety and depression was mostly caused by drinking but he never listened. He couldn’t do anything sober without going into an anxiety attack. He missed my graduation, every sport I played, didn’t teach me how to drive, and missed very important mile stones for me. He tore our family apart, my mom was so depressed. My siblings and I would avoid him most of the time. I will NEVER forgive him for what he put us through! Shortly after my 18th birthday he woke up one day and decided he was done drinking. He finally told his dr he was an alcoholic and he helped him through the withdrawals.

When I'm out with my girlfriend we drink a little faster but I'm always pretty much okay too, she probably gives me a look if I'm getting too drunk and I know to stop.

But when I'm out with my friends I can't stop, I'm getting old now it's not fun blacking out and not remembering how I got home. There's no texts the next day saying ah must of been a good night, we literally just text saying how ill we feel. I just wake up with incredible hangxiety, I check my phone to make sure I haven't sent any stupid text messages to people again. Look at my clothes to make sure I haven't spilled loads of booze on them or something and then for the next 2 days I tend to feel off. I'll spend a lot of time alone feeling remorse even though I may not have even done anything wrong. I hate it, I've cut down before but coming back from lockdown it's like I've reset. The last few times I've been out I've blacked out and I just want it to stop. I'm probably causing damage for myself in the near future, and I worry I'll do something extremely regrettable in these black outs that I can't use I was too drunk as an excuse for.

So I guess the question is... can I just stop myself getting into these situations?  Is it possible to do things to prevent it, I was thinking maybe I will refuse to go on the next night out and say I'm only going to go if we book a restaurant or something as that tends to slow my drinking down as when I'm eating you just sip and then afterwards you are too full to be drinking lots of pints. Or only go out if there are activities planned too,  but I've been getting too drunk at gigs lately as well so I don't know, easier to not drink at a gig than in a pub though if I change my mindset. Then of course the next night out will probably be a Christmas night out where everyone will just want to get drunk, can I really just refuse to go out? I feel like if I did go out and set myself a 5 pint limit I wouldn't stick to it. 

Are there drinks I could have on a night out that would still make me feel like I'm having a good time but not get me feeling like shots would be a good idea? Everything in bars is getting so strong these days, I like Guinness and that's 4.1 percent but I drink Guinness so fast, 5hen now there's just ipas that are probably 5 to 6 percent and I rarely check the percentage after a few. I also get really bad anxiety when I go out sometimes too, so the first couple of drinks I drink fast to cope with being out and get comfortable talking and being around everyone.

I really don't want to never drink again, I can enjoy it and ive been able to control it in the past. But its Wednesday now and my sleep still doesn't feel right from Saturday, the couple of days after a night out I'm not myself, I just hate it I slip into making bad decisions. I still feel regret from nights out I had 2 months ago when I blacked out and messaged random people. I know these big nights out are damaging me so much. They'll be work christmas nights too coming up. I just want to avoid them, I know I'll end up embarrassing myself somehow, and even if I don't ill just get massive anxiety that I have.

Has anyone actually been able to come up for a solution to this problem without quitting alcohol entirely? I'm sure I'm not the only one who has struggled with this before. There much be a way to get over it, I think my first step is messaging my friends and telling them how I feel. They need to understand this isn't just one of those I'm never drinking again after a bad night out and then getting back on it the next day. This is a real problem for me and something that will end really bad for me if I don't address it. I've looked at support groups but the 12 steps accepting God thing just doesn't work for me. I've written down what I want to change and how it affects others but the next week I'll forget about it all and act like I've cured myself somehow, then repet it all over again. 

I think a 30 day reset might be good for me maybe, I have some gigs coming up next week and I was thinking about either driving to them or just not going at all. They are just midweek gigs so I'm confident I wouldn't get too drunk for them but I haven't even asked anyone if they want to come with me at the moment and I just want to stay in now anyways, I'll probably change my mind by the weekend though. Maybe they are a good opportunity for me to to out and have soft drinks, knowing its a work night I shouldn't get too bad, but working from home has made me get too drunk on work nights lately as its easier to have a hangover working from home than being in work.

So yeah, any tips or experience you have dealing with similar things is appreciated....

Some suggestions I've just thought of for rules to follow maybe...
Only going out if food is planned to not drink on an empty stomach
Don't do rounds with people who push the pace of drinking 
Buy bottles of beer so I an drinking a bottle to their pint meaning I drink less overall 
Don't go out so early, if I'm going to a gig just go out for 7 instead of 5

It's been 77 days since that day, and I have spent every one of them sober, but I've had some close calls.  Nothing is ever in my house and I live alone so I never have to worry about someone else bringing stuff in, but there are 3-4 liquor stores just within 6 blocks of me so it's all just right there, all of the time.

AA was making me feel worse so I stopped going, but I do have a sponsor.  I was seeing a therapist, but his answer to most of my problems was to seek out a relationship, which I am not ready for.  (As tired as I am of doing this alone.)

I don't know if I'm journaling right now or what, I just wanted to scream into the void how hard this is right now.  My close friends were getting hurt by my state of being and I started this road of sobriety for them, but most of them have left me behind now.  It's completely understandable but it hurts like hell to only be seen as the person you were while intoxicated, while you are sober.  This week has been particularly hard and I've walked out of the house twice, fully intending to purchase something to use, coming home empty handed.  That's a win, I know, but it's still too close for comfort.

I think of them and not wanting to lose them, but I don't know how long that's going to work for when I've already lost them.  I don't know.

An old friend of his is visiting and I just overheard a conversation they were having downstairs….my husband said to his friend “I want us to plan a European boys trip together really soon, just like the good old days, we deserve it after how hard we’ve been working” and his friend said “absolutely!”   Then my husband said “I am going to drink on this trip…I need to let loose…it’s been almost 4 years…don’t tell the wife though because she’ll just worry” and his friend said “always between us.”   

This is the first time I’ve ever heard him doubt his sobriety. Ever since he quit drinking he has been 100% in it, 100% positive about it, always talking badly about drinking and drinking culture etc. so this has really surprised me. 

He has a high pressure, high stress job which he really enjoys but obviously it’s a lot. We have two very young children and are just about to buy our first house. I stay home with the kids. Obviously he has an enormous amount of pressure and stress but seems happy and strong as he always is…   

Should I bring this up with him? How could that negatively affect his choice though? I have no idea what to do. He always said, he would never drink again because if he did, he would go so hard on it that something awful would happen that first time…so I’m obviously terrified! Advice appreciated.

In those 2 days she gets absolutely wasted. She’ll have like over 8 drinks , or over 12. Sometimes I think she doesn’t say the amount cuz she’s emberassed/ literally doesn’t remember 


She’s tried to stop multiple times but said she can’t. 


She said when it’s a nice day outside the first thing she thinks about is getting a drink. 


Last year she got a DUI and into 2 car accidents (drunk both times), one in which she broke several ribs . The first thing she said when she woke up from surgery is if she could have a drink 


Her mom and several sisters are “full blown” alcoholics. 


Do you think it might sound like my mom has a problem? She says she wishes there was a medicine to take to make her not want alcohol. 


Honestly I’m kinda over it after she came home crazy drunk two days ago, screaming at my neighbors through their door at 1 am. I haven’t seen her like that in a while, but she just got back from a vacation with her sisters (they have alcohol / drug problems and encourage her to drink), so I’m sure that influenced her to get back into her ways 🤷‍♂️


I’ve been talking to her less cuz when I get attatched to her it hurts more. Plus I’m just over freaking out wondering if she put herself in a bad situation (she hangs out with morally awful people) or if she died driving home/ killed someone 


Do you think she might have some type of alcohol issue even if it’s not alcoholism? 

I wouldn’t mind the drinking as much if it literally didn’t risk her life and the lives of others (**she continues to drive super drunk even though I suggested Uber**)

Some of my friends definitely have an unhealthy relationship with it, and during quarantine I absolutely had a problem with it. I was able to recognize those things as unhealthy, and I cut back my consumption, but it is so easy for me to just get carried away and get blackout drunk at parties, or sometimes even on a regular week night. I want to be able to just enjoy it every once in a while, but I feel like I'm not capable of that. If there is alcohol available to me, it's very hard to not just drink and drink until I can't drink anymore. I drank an IPA on a recent school day ""just to get it out of my fridge"", which was a very stupid idea. It's at every social event, all my friends and family drink...even if I did decide to give it up, how do you resist all the temptations? Sorry if this was triggering to anyone, I was just wondering if anybody with experience wanted to share what they think about my situation.

Recently i went on an all inclusive holiday. I drank so much that i reckon easily over a litre of vodka per day

The reason I ask is that my kidneys feel absolutely shot. The pain is stopping me sleeping etc

Could a 2 week binge like this have damaged my kidneys? I always was certain my kidneys were weak anyway as whenever I had a bug/virus my kidneys would throb like crazy.

Also the depression is very bad. Should this lift soon or will it take a while? My sleep is also very broken.

First, I would like to thank everyone on this sub for helping me get through this, it has been the most difficult period of my life and I did not disclose my alcoholism with my family but only a bit of it with my very close friends.  To be honest, I did not stop drinking alcohol in June, because I wanted to I did it because I needed to.  Unfortunately, I can't give a comprehensive list of what helped me finally able to give it up this time compared to other times other than saying that what helped me stay true and not drink is how horrendous my GI system was and has been that forced me to not be able to drink.  It was and has been incredibly difficult as everyone on here knows all too well.  In the very early days my stomach was burning and I had daily anxiety and panic attacks that would wake me up, be with me throughout the day, forced me to stay home or inside, forced me to go to the er once actually, etc.  The anxiety attacks lasted for me for roughly 3 months and were incredibly intense for at least the first two.  With that being said, I have stuck to sobriety and I have come so far and can honestly tell everyone on here that I feel much better as my life is slowly coming back to me.  I thought at the beginning that it would be a simple process that would only take a couple weeks for me to feel better physically, emotionally, and mentally.  Although the addictive side never goes away I thought that it would only be a few weeks before the physical symptoms subsided.  Man was I wrong.  I just hit 5 months and I still have terrible IBS (belching constantly, infrequent miscolored or mistextured bowel movements, social anxiety, etc.) but it is incredible to think just how much better my life has gotten.  I am here to tell you that getting better takes time and it will is very frustrating and disheartening, but it is important to look back on the small victories and think how much better you are off now then when you started.  I still have terrible GI issues and some general anxiety but it is far better than what it was in June.  Remember it is not about you doing the wrong things it is about you not doing the right things long enough.  I am still staying true and staying sober and growing closer to normal a little each day.  Hopefully over the next 5 months and beyond my digestive system will eventually restore to what it once was and my generalized anxiety will continue to dissipate.  Until then, and even when I do recover physically I will not drink with you today and I will root for each and every one of you on here.

But maybe every 4th time I get drunk I get mean, and it comes out against people I love. I don't break things or get physically aggressive, I just get angry very easily, lash out and say cruel things to people I have nothing but love for. I kinda think it's getting worse and it's started to impact my relationship. 

I've already decided to stop getting drunk for awhile because it just can't keep happening.

I'm only in my mid 20s but this didn't used to happen, and I'm genuinely at the happiest and most in love I've ever been. 

Idk if this is relevant but my dad died 5 years ago and I became a ""sad drunk"" and would cry a lot basically every time I drank, even if I was in public. So I stopped drinking altogether for a year because I was embarrassed and uncomfortable with that. When I tried drinking again after a year, it didn't happen anymore and I've had a fine relationship with alcohol since then, until this angry phase that I don't understand.

You know what's the worst? He wanted to stop. He withdraw. But it made him a mess, delirious. He didn't know what's real and what's not. No medicine helped. I came home when it happened to help my mom get through it. I held his hand and told him it will be alright, don't worry dad. But he only talked to his imagination now. He didn't go back from this state, he layed in hospital for several days and on the last one he gave his last breath. 

He didn't get the help he needed. He tried to go into forced rehab, but in my country it's so hard, psychiatry care is so neglected and there is no money to treat people. They declined because there was no free spot for him. So he did it himself. He had to, he had a medical procedure coming up, he had to be sober for that. 

I feel like it's so all unfair. He wanted to change. He just couldn't in time. My mom said he often sat on his chair and cried saying he don't want to do it anymore, that he wants to live enough to see his granchildren. 

I'm a mess. When he lived I was often angry at him, because he was destroying his health and my moms - she was doing EVERYTHING for him, got through it all. Now I feel like I failed him, like I could've done so much more to help him. I feel so much regret inside me. 

I'm not angry at him. I feel so sorry for him. Alcoholism is a disease and it poisoned his mind. Life happened to not give him a way out. We couldn't force him. He couldn't do it in the end.

Lately, I’ve started to analyze my relationship with alcohol and I’m beginning to question its contribution to my life. I’m not a light drinker, but not excessive either. However, my drinking has become routine and I’ve developed a habit of using it to fill empty space in my day. The thing is, it’s only empty space in my head. Everyday, I come home and pour a drink. Then I start the nightly routine of cooking dinner, cleaning, giving the kids a bath, doing house projects, helping with homework, reading them books, and putting them to sleep. Throughout this process, I stop for refills along the way. By the end of the night, I have no idea how much I’ve actually consumed. Just before I sleep, I take a few hits of marijuana and perform all of my nightly personal care (shower, shave, brushing). Then I usually sleep decently and wake up with no hangover. I take my kids to school and work hard at my job only to start the cycle over again. The issue is, I’m completely numb, depressed, and unhappy without a doubt. I don’t feel any love or support from my wife, I’ve cheated on her many times, but I’m always trying to improve my relationship with her. The problem is that we are both too different and I don’t feel joy or fulfillment with her, but we have kids so I want this to work. Naturally, I want to attribute all my emotions to my daily drinking. However, it could just be the way I cope with my depression. If I stop drinking, and feel my true self, then maybe I can make the necessary improvements I need. Maybe I can make the changes without sobriety. I don’t know, but I love drinking and I don’t want to stop.

My father has a very stressful life as he is responsible for a lot of stuff. I don't get to see him that often except sometimes he comes over to my house to relax for a day or two with his son, before going back to his family and wife.

About a year ago I noticed a variety of wine bottles when I was throwing out the trash. I didn't think much of it tbh. I don't drink and I never see him drink, I just see the bottles so I was perplexed more than anything.

Fast forward to a few days ago I thought I accidentally chucked out something I needed, so I went through the recycling bin. I noticed hidden under a layer of normal recycling was a bunch of whiskey bottles of various kinds. I have never seen him drink whiskey in my life. 

Should I be concerned about this? My experience of people is they hide things for a variety of reasons and it's not my problem to pry into the lives of fully grown adults. But he is my dad and he has other health issues so I am wondering if I should be doing something.",5,0

He even told his friends that when my friend got drunk and they were returning together - he of course was totally wasted as well - he left her in a cab and went drinking until he fell asleep in a bar. 

It happens every time. The thing is, they have a baby together and she’s trying to make impression that everything is great.

He died today at only 48 years old. His heavy drinking started when he fulfilled his dream of owning his own bar. My dad was a neurosurgery nurse for 20 years and he saved his money up to buy a bar. He quit nursing and worked at the bar 12 hrs per day 7 days per week. That’s when he started drinking everyday. He said he would drink one night at the bar and be hungover the next day for work again so he would just drink again to “cure” the hangover. His drinking took an even darker turn at the end of one of his romantic relationships. He broke up with a woman after a 4 year relationship and she made rape allegations against him. The amount of stress, paranoia, and money spent on lawyers broke him. This legal battle was drawn out for three years. My father became distrustful of women, society, and the legal system. He thought people were trying to get into his head using devices and he was drinking himself sick. Eventually he attempted suicide. A couple of years after that the charges were dropped and there was nothing to show for it other than my dad had spent his entire life savings on lawyers. He felt hopeless like his life’s work was for nothing. He began drinking to cope with that stress paired with the enabling-nature of working at a bar. He eventually met a woman at the bar who was fleeing an abusive relationship. They began dating and he took her and her three young children in to live with him. This woman did not work and she drank herself sick everyday. Her children were eventually taken away from her. The pandemic hit and my dads bar was taken from him. Now there were these two alcoholics with zero responsibilities. They did nothing for 2 years straight other than listen to music and share 60 shots of whiskey per day. They barely left the house. Police and paramedics were at the house on a monthly basis. I knew my dad was basically committing a drawn out suicide by how much he was drinking. I knew he had given up and the end would be coming soon for him. I knew that’s what he wanted. Knowing that, I tried to spend more time with him but he was always so wasted I couldn’t even bear being around him for very long. Last night I heard him scream upstairs. His girlfriend called 911 and  I watched the paramedics try and resuscitate him for ten minutes. They got a pulse back and brought him to the ICU. He died hours later and they said it was a massive heart attack and liver failure. He was only 48. To me it’s like he had been dead for at least 2 years already. The disease had taken away his mind long ago. I wish I had the chance to say goodbye.",119,1

I and my father moved to NYS 4.5 years ago. I turned 21 less than a week ago. from the age of 16, I have watched my father's alcoholism get worse and worse. I am a college student and it has not been easy managing both school and my dad. November the 6th was the third time I tried to get my dad through detox. At home, with only Valium at my disposal. (We started the detox because I told him that I lost respect and I would leave him behind if he would not prioritize me over alcohol. He cried for help at that point) I had a very rough childhood with him and his horrific temper. but now I stand my ground with nothing to fear. There is nothing new that he could show me or try to do. So I did my research to be as moderate with diazepam as possible and we started. He was a heavy drinker so I started him off with 20mg every 5-6 hours. even at 3-4 in the morning, I would wake up or mostly stay up all night not to miss the alarm, wake him up and give him 2 pills. not easy at all and very draining, but he is my father after all. On day 7, I passed out. He woke up and decided to go to work. by the time I woke up, he was home just all over the place. I went to his car, I got the video micro sd card and watched how he drank 8 cans of hard seltzer after parking the car before he came upstairs. 

This happened yesterday. I'm still home, and he is still drunk I suppose. Please help me understand why exactly he went behind my back and why did he drink? he was feeling fine, It was not a small dose that Valium. I thought we were honest with each other. I was documenting every 6 hours how he felt, what symptoms have emerged, and so on... It was all going so well, or at least that's what I thought. during days 1 and 2, I made it clear to him that if he had an urge, he should tell me about it and I would consult his MD or someone more qualified than me. What went wrong?  sure he was grumpy, hell you bet that is the least he would have been after nearly 5 years of alcoholism. It is a very sad spectacle. He is killing himself and torturing me in the process. 

I don't know what to do at the given time. any advice will be much appreciated.",5,0

My wife notices it too, when we watch a movie I can't pay attention without fidgeting.  When I read I will get through a page or so and then I notice my mind wanders so even though I'm reading I'm not retaining what I read.

So I started researching ADHD and some of the other symptoms are also very common in my behaviors. I have always had difficulty completing tasks - Im great at starting but horrible at finishing. When I meet new people I almost always forget their name immediately. I lose my keys, hat, and phone constantly.  I am very impatient and I have difficulty controlling emotions. I could go on and on...

So I'm wondering if anyone else was diagnosed with ADHD or other mental disorders after getting sober? I've heard many people say that drinking in merely a symptom so I'm wondering legitimately if I've been self medicating all these years. Either way I have no intentions of drinking again but unfortunately sobriety I think has uncovered other mental issues for me.

I use to blackout on a weekly basis (usually two or maybe even three times) a week in college. My frequency of blacking out has reduced since college, but has not gone away like I always told myself it would. Again, the people I surround myself with experience blackouts as well so I just didn’t think much of it. 

That bad night coupled with some research was a good wake up call that blacking out is not “normal.”

Last night I needed a drink. Which turned into 6 in 15 minutes. I blacked out. And this morning I woke up with the worst hangover of my life. I told my friend and they finally blew up at me and told me I'm an alcoholic. The more I think about it, the more I realize they're right.

I drink nearly everyday. And I can never stop at one or two. I usually have between 3-7 drinks in a day, although sometimes it's as many as 10. (Also I'm tiny, 161cm and 50kg). I drink at times where I didn't intend to, like before work. I drink despite it fucking with my physical and mental health. I'm on a lot of medications which say ""limit alcohol"" and drinking makes me more likely to collapse/faint repeatedly the next day because it worsens a preexisting health condition and it makes my depression worse the next day too. I've spent hundreds on alcohol in the past few months. I crave alcohol most of the time and it's one of my first thoughts when I wake up. And I usually drink myself to sleep. I hide the extent of my drinking from almost everyone. And lately I've been missing school because I was too hungover to function.

My girlfriend has been trying to limit my drinking and that makes me angry and upset. And I get kind of defensive whenever someone points out that I have a problem and that I shouldn't drink so much.

Alcohol is basically taking over my life. I need to stop drinking because I can't drink in moderation and it's starting to screw up my life. But I don't know if I can stop drinking. I don't know what to do. I think I need help...



Edit: I had a health scare this week which may have been related to my drinking. People thought I was having a stroke, I couldn't walk, talk, or see properly. My doctor has confirmed it wasn't a mini stroke, but we have no idea what happened. It's possible my blood pressure dropped too low and so my brain wasn't getting quite enough blood/oxygen, causing the symptoms. I had been drinking prior to this and I know alcohol drops my blood pressure, which is already on the low side so it may be because of that.

I also found out my kidneys aren't functioning quite as well as they should be which may also be related to my drinking.

That should have been a massive wakeup call, but it didn't stop me from drinking again last night. I'm not sure I'm ready to get sober yet.",11,0

Fast forward and I find a new partner and everything is going fine for the first year and a bit until they lost her job and developed, or I guess just embraced, their anxiety and stopped really trying to seek employment or much of anything. Now, that wasn't a problem but they started drinking Vodka on weekends which wasn't an issue at first but eventually she would down a 750 ML bottle of Absolut in a night and would then usually vomit it all up in the morning. They would always complain about not being able to get drunk unless they took shot after shot leading them to get a point where they lost all logic and would just keep going until the bottle was done or they were. Then this became a thing they  would do during the week, but maybe not always leading to conflict or vomiting. 

Eventually, i became concerned and started getting 375 ML bottles and while that did help curb them going completely overboard it just meant they would ask for me to get it more often. Now, they have expressed concern after each of these bad nights and would abstain for a while before saying that they will just ""try to be more in control"" and go back to the Cylcle. Currently it's been a few weeks where I couldn't get anything for them due to financial limits as the sole provider in the relationship nearly everyday they message me that they want Vodka or crave it. They give me reasons why they don't have a problem and that it would help them since they just want to have fun. 

This is where my dilemma comes in, I have issues knowing if I'm enabling or overreacting due to my prior issues dating an alcoholic. As a way to avoid further issues I have nearly given up drinking myself (maybe 2-3 times a year I'll have a drink or two).

I’m in the very early stages of exploring this sub and figuring out how I feel about everything. But basically since COVID I’ve been drinking every night. 

I know this is nothing compared to true alcoholics who drink all day, everyday, but it’s definitely the early stages of something that could become more problematic. I know this because I was addicted to opioids in the past. 

Most people would say that when I quit heroin I should’ve quit everything. But I was able to drink moderately/like a normal person for quite some time until COVID hit. I just had too much time on my hands and it hasn’t fully returned to normal since. 

If I’m being honest, I have 6 drinks a night on average. Sometimes it’s 5, sometimes it’s 7, but it’s usually 6. This number has been continuous since last winter. I’m starting to notice the brain fog, lack of motivation, fatigue, stomach issues and puffiness. Dear lord..I see people much heavier than me with slimmer faces. I think a lot of the health issues I’ve been complaining about these past few months are linked to my drinking. 

I am going to start with a reasonable goal- no more drinking alone and then take it from there. Since I started doing that I’ve had intense food cravings but I suppose thats normal. I don’t want to set any lofty goals yet (I.e. “I’m never drinking again.”). My most recent physical was last spring so hopefully I haven’t done any major irreversible damage since then. 

I know everyone’s different but any advice, vitamins or supplements I can take to help my return to normalcy is much appreciated. I know magnesium was a lifesaver when I got off opiates, so I’m open to anything. And how long did it take for you to de-puff/debloat?",10,2

Anyway, after a few very early AM phone calls over the last week where he said his back is still too bad and he needs cortisone injections (he sounded totally out of it on the phone and I thought it was the combination of pain/medication), he rang me this morning and told me he can't come in because he is an alcoholic.

Sobering up has given me the ability to think, and I have used it fully. Getting all As with a full load, but more of my thinking ability has gone to parsing my anxiety and why I drink.

Grew up being abused by my brother who is seven years older than me. Lots of physical stuff, locked in the dryer and he turned it one, drug me around the house in a sleeping bag, up and downstairs, locked me outside in the winter naked. But the emotional stuff was worse, always telling me I was ugly and just picking at me. When I was older my mother revealed that I had bruises up and down my legs when I went in for my six-month checkup and she now realizes my brother was likely pinching my legs in my crib.

The story that got told in my family as we became adults is no one knew why he was that way, and he was so good at hiding it that no one knew we were being abused. I am starting to see that is bullshit. My dad is a pothead who smokes every day and is an old-school guy. I always remember being vaguely scared of him as a kid, he was just kind of loud and rambunctious. I remember him beating our dogs if they did something wrong and he used the belt on my older brother. There was an incident when I was a teenager in which he was bitching me out for doing something wrong and I was hanging my head. I got tired of the constant barrage of anger and I simply stood up and looked him in the face, he backhanded me and nearly knocked me over. I am starting to see that my older brother was likely influenced by my father's violence and intimidation into being a narcissistic asshole.

I realize all of this as I am living with my parents now and seeing how my father behaves. When I started complaining about his slamming doors and drawers because it was waking me up and amping my anxiety he got visibly angry. My anxiety since I quit has been pretty uncomfortable, lots of anxiety attacks at school and home, once requiring a trip to the ER. He just doesn't care. He thinks since he is the father that I need to always be serving him. He is a narcissist and egomaniac. I had thoughts of following him to one of his jobs and beating him up, and then realized I had learned that sort of thought pattern from him. I am now doing a lot of meditating and my philosophy class has helped with perspective, I am just trying to survive his company until I can get out of here. The anxiety is so bad, I fear I might have serious problems trying to get back to work. My mom enables him, but she doesn't know any better. Her father was an alcoholic so she thinks the weed thing is lightweight and cant see how big of a dick he is. They don't charge me rent and they pay for my food. I think I just need their help for one more semester and then I hope to be far enough in recovery to work again.

I also now see that anxiety has been a problem for me my whole life and I have sort of denied it. I never hold down jobs for long, and the alcohol was a part of that but I also see how anxiety plays a role in making long-term relationships painful for me. I am very introverted and get exhausted from maintaining a public self, I much prefer to be home alone with a book. I am studying to write fiction, please don't judge my writing by this piece, I am just doing stream of consciousness and not constructing much. This semester has been good as far as grades, but also frustrating because I don't have much energy to write outside of scholastic writing, and I used to write for fun pretty often. I know my skills are improving, and next semester I will be writing for classes that have more to do with storytelling so I am anxious to get through this semester.

I wish I could write in more detail, the revelations that come with being sober and being able to see people for who they are is amazing. My whole family lives in this patriarchal dreamworld in which my father does no wrong, and he successfully bamboozled everyone in the family into believing this. The power of deception, both of self and others, is amazing. I now have the task of separating out all the crap he taught me from the actual morally sound things that he did teach me. He taught me to objectify women, but did it in a jokey way so it was 'acceptable'. He taught me to not admit you are wrong unless it is something that is obvious to everyone, the narcissistic ego protection mode. Above all, he taught me to put myself at the center of the world and to ignore the pain of others. And our society encourages these traits because it makes good employees. My father's pride in his sales job is so all-consuming he has little time for anything else. He could comfortably retire now, but he says he is scared he will die if he stops working.

I am so tired and frustrated. Frustrated that it took me this long to see this, frustrated that our society is so fucked that it actively encourages these types of personalities. I am mad that I had to go through my adult life in a haze and that I was a big asshole and took advantage of people thinking I was living life in accordance with some sort of morality but it just turns out to be a toxic masculinity version of morality. I don't really even know how to change, I just try to learn and grow through my studies and counseling, and meditation. One of the most frustrating parts of toxic masculinity is I see so much of that myopic old-school assholism IN MEN(and sometimes women) IN RECOVERY PROGRAMS. They say the only way to recover is the way they are doing it, and that it is a hierarchy and you must bow down to those who have been through it. So many of these guys are just my father without the substances. Dry drunks. The way someone teaches says a lot about who they are and how far along they really are in their journey.

If you are struggling with anything like what I am, I would highly encourage you to find a counselor or psychologist or some medical professional to talk to. If you choose to do group work that is fine, but know that there is a big difference between social groups and medical care, and make no mistake alcoholism is a medical disease. Prayer and mediation seem necessary to me as well, if you don't have a god you feel comfortable praying to, maybe pray to someone you admire or love. Getting exercise, quality sleep, and eating well is imperative to making an honest attempt at recovery. Make sure you can identify healthy and unhealthy relationships, this part can be really tricky, especially if most of your current relationships revolve around using. The most important relationship you need to develop is with yourself, and identifying when you are being honest and when you are bullshitting yourself is very important. Serenity, courage, and wisdom are traits you will need to develop, and that prayer is very useful in a multitude of situations. If you think you need to quit START NOW and don't stop trying to quit. For some it takes weeks, for some years, and for some it is a lifetime battle, but I have yet to hear someone say they regret trying. Good luck to you.",6,0

Almost two years ago I was in Bangkok for holiday and got absolutely hammered beyond anything I think I've ever been in my entire life. I mean guys do what they do when they go to Thailand, but I was in a very bad way at the time without even realizing it, thinking I was happy living abroad, acting recklessly, not being myself. It culminated in the biggest hangover I have ever had, a few restless nights and eventually I flew home. 

I lived happily and peacefully for about 2 or 3 months upon my return having no recollection whatsoever of where I went, what I did that night until I had like a flashback, or rather a thought, a preoccupation that maybe I could have done something abhorrent. Ever since I have ruminated almost incessantly, sifting through my memories, trying to turn every stone, obsessing over the fear that maybe I hurt someone. Do I have that potential?. It's like having a large jigsaw puzzle in front of you, but you only have a few pieces that they don't quite arrange a picture just yet, but with some time you will get it finished. 

I'm not sure if it's obsessive fear which is driving me to either recall or confabulate these memories. But over the past year and a half, I feel I've been able to recreate with some degree of confidence my trajectory that night, vague images of walls, surroundings, and emotions I was feeling at the time. Although I do not remember any faces or any words but I do remember there were some people with me. 

However I am still plagued every day with doubt. I will often content myself with the conclusion of a new memory to then move on to piece together the next part of it. I guess what I want to know is, if its possible to somehow unlock memories you had when you blacked-out, or if it really is just a result of a false memory, paranoia or something similar?

We know every little thing about one another. We have had very different lives and lifestyles, especially since entering adulthood. I’ve been in and out of therapy, struggled with addiction issues, made many many mistakes. She’s a scholar, has a great family supporting her, a loving relationship, and she’s all around a great person. My addiction issues were addressed head on when I ended up in the hospital last weekend for alcohol detoxing. I’m a binge drinker. Only on weekends. Usually something bad occurs, and I confide in her. She decided that my actions were becoming too much and said that even though she loves me and I’ll always be in her life, if I ever do this again she won’t support me. And she doesn’t want to speak with me right now. I told her I was in the hospital (willingly) to get help. I was there for an entire day, and going through withdrawals. For the first time I nearly thought I was going to die or had done extensive damage. She hasn’t spoken to me since I said I was in the hospital and promised to get better.

See, I understand I messed up. Not only did I drink myself into hospital but I drank and drove and crashed my car too. Of everyone who reached out to me, to make sure I was okay, I didn’t expect to be shut out by her. It hurts. To be honest, I often feel like we shouldn’t be friends anymore considering our separate paths in life. I don’t know what to do. I’m going to AA, and my plan is to focus on me from here on out. I just don’t know if I should move on without ever reaching out or tell her that I’m hurt.

Edit: she just messaged “hope you feel better today” that’s all. No acknowledgment of the hospital or trauma. I messed up. I committed one of the most selfish acts.",3,0

Wish I had known sooner that it could be okay.","I quit drinking last week (wednesday). For my entire adult life I've been on various medications/substances, and (ab)used them to try and cope with my bipolar disorder. That includes alcohol, which has been my go-to for at least the last few years. I'd say I've been drinking on average about 500 ml daily of gin or equivalent for two years, and it wasn't much less before that. I think it has been about 10 years that i averaged anything less than a third of a liter of gin a day. Perhaps once every week or two I'll drink a whole liter, usually in response to some breakdown/panic attack. My average intake has steadily been increasing though. I also take benzos, and a slew of other medication to help me sleep or to get through the day.

Last week i'd finally had it with feeling bad every morning, being depressed and having next to no energy, so i just threw everything out. Haven't been using benzos for a few weeks now already (ran out), so I suppose the alcohol was the most significant substance that had the potential to cause immediate withdrawal issues. 

What surprised me though, is that I have had no withdrawal. Zero. It has been hard to sleep, but it was hard before, and I cant say I notice much difference there. Otherwise, nothing. I know other alcoholics regularly drink a multiple of what I put away daily, but I still suspected something of a withdrawal.

I was really worried about stopping. Worried it would throw me off, and cause problem with my mood especially. This kept me from taking the step to stop. I wish I had known before that it would be okay. I could have stopped sooner. Maybe it helps someone else to read this. Just try it. It may not be as bad as you think.

Of course, this is just the beginning for me, and there are other challenges than the immediate withdrawal. One day at a time though. 

Would love to hear about similar experiences from other people, where withdrawal didn't quite turn out as bad as you thought.

It gives the same kind of mouth kick as whiskey does for the most part. Anytime I’ve found myself thinking about having a drink I think about the day of my wreck and the craving passes. I truthfully didn’t know I could be this strong, but somehow I’m doing it. I wish everyone luck on their journeys with or without alcohol, but most importantly I hope you all stay safe. Thank you all again. I’m not saying it’s been easy, but these things have helped me a lot. Hopefully I can get some better sleep soon. I hope everyone has a wonderful rest of their week.

I didn’t want it to ever get to this point. I knew I had a problem for the longest time, drinking generally at least a pint of bourbon a day if not more towards a fifth. My relationship, my body, my work ethic at my now ex-job, and the motivation to complete my college coursework has all suffered. It finally happened. I totaled my car because I was drunk driving. One of the scariest parts is that I still can’t remember the ten seconds leading up to the impact with the power pole. All I know is I crossed two lanes that were going the opposite way, down an embankment, and into a parking lot where the pole was. I don’t know how I didn’t manage to hit anyone else. I don’t know how I didn’t get flung through my windshield, as I wasn’t wearing a seatbelt because the buckle doesn’t latch. I don’t know how I managed to only bruise my face and scrape up my arms when the airbags failed and I hit the dashboard. By all means, I should be dead. I know I wanted to be dead at that moment. After drinking heavily for more than two and a half years straight with no breaks, I am giving up alcohol cold turkey. I’d rather the punishment of my severe withdrawals remind me why I will never touch alcohol again than try to taper anymore. Tapering doesn’t work for me. Every time I close my eyes I see myself staring at the pole I hit. Every night when I try to sleep I have nightmares about getting into another car crash. There has to be more to life than this. I have to change. I’m so ashamed of myself, and the reality keeps hitting me like harsh waves smacking me down. I have to do better.",22,0

That's not to say it hasn't been an issue that has always needed to be addressed, it's to say that I always had a good time drinking and never saw many of the consequences you frequently hear about with people who over indulge, alcoholics (which I certainly am one..). 
But something changed 3 years ago (38 at the time) after a separation from my fiancee of 16 years. My intake slowly climbed.. until it got to the point where I started experiencing blackouts, something completely foreign to me previous. No matter the amount or circumstance, I always remembered everything. Since then I have stopped for a month here and there, but they still return. Something else I've noticed, I no longer get that buzzed feeling. It seemingly goes right from 0 to blackout with no feelings in between. I know that medical advice is not expected, but had anyone else had experience with this? I know many will say things such as ""at your age"", but it happened suddenly, literally over night. It causes a lot more anxiety and depression then I would have imagined

Again, I know the answer is to hang it up, stop drinking. I won't argue that. However I'm curious to an answer/phenomenon/experience that can explain it. I'm not a ""don't worry"" type, lol, I search out explanations for things, for peace of mind. 

To add, I have been under constant stress and anxiety the past few years and wonder if that plays a role in the effects of alcohol. Also, rate of consumption or quantity does not seem like the main culprit in blackouts....as I can tailgate at a football game, have 15+ drinks and remember everything, yet since on a couch, have 6-8 and it's lights out at times. Curious if the lack of stimulation plays a role as well..aka being bored. If it's a day with something exciting or exciting people, it certainly seems to happen less

I drink spirits. About 15 units a night and very nearly always every night. 
I’m unwell most days. But not the throwing up kind anymore. Just the lightheaded and weird head feeling bit like pressure in temples etc! And just not with it.
I am trying to taper off. Now 47f and my body just can’t take it anymore.

Thing is the thing that induces most anxiety when I’m trying to go sober is the assault on my OCD - but it’s not really OCD. What I mean is, old house. Lots going wrong. I can kinda sort of ignore some of it when I’m drinking. 
Smells. Paranoid about smells in house . We have cats and they go outside for the toilet, but even so the smell is more obvious when I’m sober even though I clean surfaces every day and spray air freshener but the smell is there all the time. My house isn’t a hoarding crap hole and I clean up after every mess and meal and so on but it’s small and old and attracts muck and I spend so long cleaning up and I find it too much to cope with.
Also general life. When I’m sober I am just simply not good enough and get throngs wrong or that’s how it seems. Trying to keep on top of what is a crappy life where everyone else copes is just too shitty for words! I just can’t cope with it. I’m sort of a perfectionist but not like a workaholic not like that at all that doesn’t bother me. More like with friendships and being good and kind. If I don’t see or visit others then I can cope when I’m drinking but going sober that just magnifies all those feelings of not being a good enough friend etc…
Sobriety brings feeling like shit about everything I am and everything I do and everything I don’t do or forget or whatever.
It’s bloody awful to feel that way.
And that’s why I drink. To make those feelings go away. And to stop the feelings magnifying way beyond what I can deal with and to stop me having a huge mental breakdown or psychotic episode ! 

How can I stop when these feelings are far too overwhelming for words?!!!",5,0

I originally wanted to detox for a month or two to prove to myself that I wasn’t addicted. I don’t consider myself an alcoholic (I can admit I usually take it “too far”, but I’m definitely not “alcohol dependant”), but several of my friends and family have suggested I have some sort of problem with booze. 

I wanted to share a few things I personally found over the last 12 months;

- The peer pressure around drinking is immense. Friends constantly pushing me saying “have one, go on” even after me explaining I’m detoxing. If you don’t drink alcohol people (most but not all) think it’s weird..
- Alcohol is expensive! I worked out I saved around £150 a month from not drinking..
- Being sober can be “boring” compared to being drunk..
- Waking up without a hangover is amazing. I didn’t realise/appreciate how good this feels until I had a long break from alcohol
- Being in the world sober is scary. Social situations particularly can be daunting without “liquid confidence” at your aid
- Alcohol is way too socially accepted. I don’t care what anyone says, alcohol is a drug. If you went into work and told your colleagues you had a shocking hangover from drinking they would probably laugh and think nothing of it. If you said, however, you had a hangover from drugs they would think you have a problem. 

The reason I’m not detoxing any longer is I feel that I no longer have anything left to prove. I feel I’ve got my health back, and from now on I’ll be sticking to 3/4 drinks to enjoy my night, rather than going over the top and getting blackout drunk.

I'm from a long line of alcoholics. My grandpa grew up in a family that valued toughness and looks. So naturally he took out his alcoholic rages by  beating and ridiculing my sensitive, chubby father. His siblings even say that nobody got it like Steve. His sister is gorgeous, his brother's tall and handsome. My dad's a good looking guy but never had the self esteem to hold it up.

I'm a lot like my dad. He didn't beat or tease me but he was scared of me in a way he didn't understand for a really long time. A picture of everything he was told was wrong with him. He was angry, controlling, and neglectful because of his drinking. I left the house when I was 17, moved my stuff out while everyone was gone, they didn't notice for four days. When he called me to ask if I had gone he sounded defeated. For the first time in my life I had gone against what he wanted and he wasn't angry, he was just sad.

My dad's been sober for 13 years, since I was about 15, but he really started living a couple years ago. He got into therapy, restarted his career, fell back in love with my mom, the works! He and I reconciled and even became friends, it turns out we have a lot in common (lol).

I've always been a heavy drinker, goes with the sneaking out and the friends that would piss off my parents! But I started problem drinking around 22 and it got really out of control after my son was born 3 years ago. I hit my breaking point 5 months ago and sobered up. Now I'm in therapy, starting my career, spending time with my son, and reconnecting with my husband, the works!

My grandpa never got sober. My grandma, the love of his life by his own claims, left him ang he didn't change. His second wife, lovely lady, left him and he got worse. He moved into a tiny apartment and spent all his time and money on booze. Once handsome, he'd turned into a broken, frail husk of a man.

At one point he was invited back to Holiday parties simply because he was so sad and pitiful. He would tell us which of my siblings was currently the prettiest or point out my sister's weight loss (that was due to extreme stress) or complain about how I had my first kid at such an old age (25?).

And guys...

 He died last week. 

And he was dead for three days before anyone found him.

The reason he was found was because the complex scheduled a time to change his locks and he didn't answer the door. They had the cops do a wellness check and they found him dead.

And guys... No one was sad. No one cried. No one was even surprised.

Some people were relieved.

This got a little long but my point is this: it's only too late once it's over.

I had to get back on track and my dad had to restart completely but we did it! My grandpa had opportunity after opportunity and he didn't. Heck, he was invited to a family dinner a week before his death but he turned it down to stay home and drink. He made is priorities and he truly believed he was alone, so he was.

You're not alone! You are part of a community that understands where you are and the pain that you feel. Your trauma isn't who you are and you CAN be the person you want to be, you CAN survive this too. Stay safe.",20,0

Im from the netherlands so forgive my spelling and grammer.

Yesterday i verbally assaulted my ex and boss through whatsapp in a drunken haze.

My alcohol abuse started at age 9 (i know) Im from a sailers/shippers family and alcohol is normalised there.
This was in the form of liquir bonbons, small vodka shot glass and wine at dinners (not every day)

The alcohol abuse grew in intensity when i was allowed to went to town to party at age 14. Many many years later at age 24 i was so sick and tired of it and asked the dockter for some help. At this point i was drinking abouth 12 lieter (3.17 gallon) of beer and 0.5 lieter (0,13 gallon) of hard liquir a day.
The man gave me some meds and a scedual to lower 1 drink each day until it reaches 0. Amazingly that worked and was able to stay clean for 10 years.

Sadly it dint stick. Altough there are some good reasons it still is hurting my life to this day.

The reason (not excuus) is that i started a relationship with a woman that had 2 kids wich 1 has autism 1 have ADD and she herself was also cronically ill. That was more than i could handle. She also drank wine 1 to 2 glasses each day but wasnt alcoholic. My barrier was slowly breaking down and when i got a second back opperation i started to selfmedicate, wich was a big big misstake.

Everyday i started drinking more and more, i eventually ended the relationship and in that year the corona hit the world. In my mind it was justified to drink as a painkiller. Destroying myself mentally and physically. Last week i seeked profecional help again, and after the intake i bought 3 bottles of hard liquir and got wasted. Last night i got awake and realiced that i verbally assaulted my ex and boss.

The shame is intense...

I decided to write them an appoloy mail and told them i seeked help.
I dumped all alcohol that was left in the drain.

Today i called the guys at the professional help explaining what happened. They told me to sit through the weekend and monday i will be called and the proces will start.
Im gona get meds that will make me sick if i drink and hopefully solve this selfdestruction.

Im so angry, sad, tired and sick of myself and my behaiver.",39,1

I want him to get help but I'm just mentally preparing myself for the possibility that he won't and trying to emotionally prepare myself to leave and don't know what to do. I'm currently 5 months pregnant and just feel really distraught. 


He went from occasionally drinking at parties and after work when we were younger to a drink or two with dinner every night to more recently 5+ drinks each night. I've tried to tell him I'm concerned with how much he's been drinking and I think he's in denial and either is lying when he says he doesn't drink that much or truly believes that he doesn't. Tonight I could smell alcohol on him and noticed he was slightly slurring his words. I told him he seemed drunk and he said that he was fine and only had 2 drinks. After he went to bed I went through the trash and counted how many he had and he had 6. What if I needed to go to the hospital? He would've thought that he was fine to drive and put both us and our unborn baby at risk? What if he thinks he's fine when he isnt and accidentally injures our baby? We got into an argument a few days ago because I told him that he can't drink while taking care of a newborn and would need to cut it out altogether. I expected him to say obviously but he got defensive and started arguing with me that 1 or 2 beers is fine and saying that I haven't shown him any studies showing that it isn't. I was dumbfounded.


I just don't trust him anymore to leave him alone with a child and don't think this is a safe environment for a child. I'm just really heartbroken. What do you do in this situation? Give him an ultimatum? Just leave? Talk to him? Talking hasn't got us very far and he just denies that his drinking is an issue and nothing changes. He insists he barely drinks and isn't drunk but I can see with my own eyes when he's stumbling around and I can tell when he's drunk by how he speaks and I can count all the bottles sitting in the trashcan. I feel like he'd be an amazing father and I know he's so excited to be one but it's just so exhausting worrying about him and so stressful being in this environment.

I'm 80 pounds over weight. I only hold 2 meaningful relationships. My mother and a friend I served with and of that we sparsely communicate. I haven't had a girlfriend in over a decade.

If you are struggling with alcohol or have someone in your family that has alcohol use disorder I hope my story here can help you in some way. 

I want to apologize ahead of time because telling you this story is a little selfish of me as I am writing this to help myself move on from years of torture. I will not sugar coat anything and will write it with raw emotion I am currently feeling. After 32 years of living this nightmare, a son of a alcoholic father can tell his story to total strangers. 

As I am writing this my 57 year old father is in the hospital with end-stage cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse. He has been drinking for 40 years non-stop. I was born in Croatia and let me tell you, the stories are true, those Europeans can drink. Right to their death. I lived in Europe until I was 12 years old and then we moved to the States. In Croatia, as I remember back then we had little to nothing. We lived in a small house, one bed, one room, black-white television, you can change channels, get this, by moving a antenna on top of the roof! I guess as a child I was thankful for what I had, but the best part was my father coming home completely blasted begging me to sleep with him. The terror I felt every night still haunts me today. 

As I got older I started to understand he was drinking daily after this construction job at multiple bars as my mother tried to keep me alive and fed. His bullshit didn’t stop there, he constantly cheated on my mother on a weekly basis and I knew this even when he came home drunk as fuck still begging me to sleep with him. He was never abusive towards me but treated my mother as though she was 50ft below him. For those 12 years I lived the same days over and over again with parents fighting, him constantly drinking.

When we moved to the States my mother and I had hoped to start fresh. Even though things started well at first it soon all fall apart. The fighting was consistent, my parents couldn’t keep any friends because my father no matter where he went always had to drink. We were offered many services like teaching them how to speak English but my father refused because he had to give up drinking. As soon as they bought their first house and I started High School, he started to again cheat on my mother through some chat services. She finally had enough of him and confronted him only to get pushed, punched and shoved right in front of me and I can still smell his alcoholic breath as he was screaming at her. 

My mother being an angel who is just trying to keep her family together forgave him. 1 year later he lost his job for being caught with alcohol at work and my parents foreclosed their only home they will ever own. For 19 years my parents lived in an apartment tarnishing their credit, relationships, didn’t travel, anything remotely productive to help their lives. My mom finally created a company of her own and hired my father to work. Day after day he would drink before and after the jobs. I do not want to explain what all of this did to me, but you can imagine. His alcoholism ruined my life. I wished to this day I could have a normal family trip to Disneyland.

Fast forward 2 months ago he started to fall apart. When he’s drunk he would fall, forget, get irritated easily, until one day he completely went unconscious. He was taken to the Hospital and turned completely yellow. That is when we knew his liver couldn’t handle it anymore. I don’t live with my parents, so when I went to see him at the hospital I can tell you that it angered me so much for moment I didn’t have an inch of remorse.

It angered me because he allowed all this to happen knowing he would drag my mother and I with him. We were dragged again to another low point in our lives and now my mother is constantly crying and I am fighting anger and sadness not knowing what to feel for him. I will not lie, I am still avoiding to see him even when they let him come home. My mother is constantly caring for him and I take him or his dialysis appointment because his kidneys don’t work. The doctors aren’t in a hurry to give him a liver because of alcoholism, and I can tell they know where he is headed soon. As I am writing this as his ammonia levels are so high he is going in and out of a coma. 

I want to tell everyone, we tried everything. He always refused help from anyone and would rather hide his alcohol and tell us he’s not drinking than actually fight this and help us move on. Instead of moving on, we are waiting for him to pass, in sadness and in anger, knowing he chose alcohol over his family. 

I hope you found some meaning in my story, and thank your kind soul for reading this far. Even though I hope my dad pulls through, it angers me to think my mom will have to take care of him 24hr/day for months if he gets a liver transplant. 

If you are someone struggling with alcohol, please accept help from professionals before it gets to this point. If you are a family member of an alcoholic, keep trying even though it hurts, and even if one day it comes to the point, remember it’s not your fault, take care of yourself.",75,0

Here’s how I ruined a three year relationship in twelve hours.","I was on vacation with my SO of three years, but we stayed near his work because he had to work that Saturday. I got hammered and blacked out, but I do remember him screaming “LAY THE FUCK DOWN”  a lot and dumping the rest of the bottle down the sink. He left me at the Air BNB and went home. 

I felt horrible. I just drank the one day and didn’t binge or spiral, but I ruined our first ever weekend trip. Friday night was one of the best nights of my whole life, and I’d turned Saturday into one of the worst. I hated myself so much at that time. I didn’t live with my SO, so I apologized repeatedly over text, but my SO would only reply “S’all good.” over and over and it was clearly not all good. 

SO finally talked to me Saturday night and told me that he felt like I picked alcohol over him, and that hurt him.  One of them many reasons I got sober was because I picked alcohol over *everything* my freedom, my safety, my job, my family… and now I just hurt the person who has supported me and my recovery the most. 

Relationship eventually progressed, but it was very different. When I would ask for emotional support, I’d very rarely get anything. I started to only see him occasionally on my lunch break. He basically stopped coming over at night and wouldn’t stay the night. About a month after the trip, I asked him to stay the night soon because I was lonely and he told me I’d have to wait until he bought a new car - when I pushed it, he snapped “if you’re that damn lonely, maybe you should get on tinder.” I knew he was angry, but I didn’t know he was still this angry. I started to really worry at this point. 

Over the next couple of months, my SO stopped texting throughout the day most of the time, and tended not to provide friendship or emotional support anymore, although we still had an active sex life when he did come over. 

My depression got worse and worse, and around the beginning of October, he ended things for my mental health. I reached out last week to ask if he stopped loving me that day at the lake, and he responded, “Yes, pretty much.”

She was a high functioning alcoholic going into work everyday but drinking in the evening. Partying all weekend long or drinking during the day on weekends. 

We never had the best relationship and when i had my first child in 2015 i was sure i would never let her babysit. 
Well in summer of 2015 she got leukemia and was in hospital for 8 months.
She obviously couldn‘t drink anymore while in the hospital and after she came home she had to take strong medication and was told that if she ever drank again it would destroy her liver.
This seemed to work, she stopped drinking completly our relationship improved and she was the best grandma for my kids. 
It all lastet for 5 years.
Yesterday my dad told me that she started drinking again a few weeks ago. 

I called her today and confronted her. She said it was only once after a espacially stressful day and only three glasses of wine. 
I told her she needs to get help immediatly before it gets worse. 

She is in complete denial. She says she isn‘t an alcoholic anymore. She doesn‘t crave it and she would never let this happen again. She told me she didn‘t drink in the last two weeks and has everything under control. Her family and her life are too important to her, she would never risk this.

I didn‘t tell her, but i don‘t belive her. I‘m so angry at her. It‘s the same lame excuses and promises from my childhood. 
I can‘t deal with this. I don‘t want to. And i want to protect my kids from the heartbreak of learning that grandma choses the bottle over them. 

I‘m in therapy for two years now and i thought i was doing fine. But hearing that she drinks again makes me want to cry and scream and cut contact.

I have a problem, I have always had this problem because alcohol is my escape, especially now, being 30 years old and just starting my life I feel as if it is near impossible to hold myself together without a drink. Seeing my peers so far ahead of me kills me every single day and I drink. 

This is my story and I am just looking for advice, experience ro words of encouragement. I just feel like now just starting grad school and a career I threw my whole life away and have been coping with alcohol just like I did with all of my other problems.",15,0

Anyways, I've had a drinking problem for probably the past 8 months or so. I consume roughly 5-7 standards drink nightly, and the only the longest I've spent sober is about 5 days back in June. 

The past couple months I've noticed increases in anxiety during social situations, most noticeable tremors and heart palpitations. I know these are obviously hallmark symptoms of WD, but these have really only been occurring in certain situations, not necessarily all the time. So I guess I'm a little doubtful as to whether they're from detoxing. I know there's a good chance I'm simply in denial, and I already recognized my drinking has gone too far. 

Anyways, I'm curious to hear from you guys as to what your WD was like, and from roughly how much drinking at the time.",3,0

Recently I started snooping because she got less and less discreet with hiding the bottles. And I’d had a hunch and smelled it on her too. We had a great talk last week with my therapist and I sort of gave her an ultimatum. She was going to do something about her addiction or we were going to break up. She even reached out to get her own therapist and invited me to an open AA meeting. 

Cut to this evening she left for an errand (and didn’t go to that AA meeting) and came back in what I’d describe as under the influence. I asked and she denied of course but eventually slurred her speech into sleeping on the couch. 

I decided it was my chance to check her usual hiding places. And I found several looked like easily 100 bottles of various types of alcohol in her car. 

What do I do with this knowledge? I’ve considered an intervention with her parents and sister. But I’m concerned that’s going to backfire. Her parents know we’ve been having issues lately but not that she’s relapsing knowledge. And her ex boyfriend staged an intervention when they were together before she got sober. They broke up because of her alcoholism. I’m just so torn, I love and care for this person so deeply. But I know she has to want to change. Support or encouragement welcome please…",4,0

So many excuses over the years, “I’m young, let’s live it up” “I’ll get sober when the time is right”. 


I’ve had periods of sobriety over the last couple years, weeks and months of sobriety and weeks and months of drinking 12-24 beers a day. The physical and cognitive effects of this habit have subtlety progressed to the point of being noticeable. My mental acuity is much slower, my memory? Forget it. Information processing has become more of a challenge than ever. My mood swings tend to correspond with my drinking tendencies, perpetuating my dependency on alcohol. My physical health has declined as well. I used to be an avid athlete. Now I can’t even run a KM without gambling sudden cardiac arrest. I’ve lost 20 pounds, which is truly perplexing given the amount of calories I ingest. 

I estimate I’ve spent somewhere between 50-75k (enough to pay off my student loans, or by a Tesla or something) on alcohol in my lifetime between the cost of sustaining my consumption, and the consequences of my actions. 


I used to be the party guy. All of my high school years were spent curating a robust social life. Of all the people I associated with and called friend, I only keep in touch with about 1/20 of them now. Alcohol has been my closest companion ever since my best friend passed away from his own addictions.

I've always had an issue with alcohol. Guess I've always been dependent on it. I hit a REALLY rough spot about a year and a half ago. Got a DUI, didn't chill the eff out til a few months later. Since then I've managed it. Went from daily drinking to only drinking 2-3 days a week. But usually always in excess. I was able to get my drinking under control with the help of lorazapam. At the time I hated them. They helped. But the benzo addiction was stronger than alcohol. Took me forever to get off them. 

I know that I have a high tolerance. Me having a pint after work is nothing. I only drink liquor. Beer makes me sick, and wine gives me headaches. But a pint of svedka...nothing. 

This last weekend it hit me bad. I ended up on a 4 day bender. 

Now I'm withdrawing like a MFer and I'm miserable and scared. I wake up multiple times a night with what I can only describe as cross between my brain swimming and my body shaking. 

I'm taking Gaba supplements. I have exactly ONE oxazepam left from 2020. Which I plan on using tomorrow to get me though my 10 hour shift without dying. 

I've already talked to my DR a couple months ago about NAL or something on that area. She was not at all helpful and told me to find a psychiatrist. 

What I can I take OTC to at least get me through the next days? I finally ate a small meal after 2 days of no food. I'm sipping Gatorade to get my sugar up. I'm tapering with alcohol but I'm already at a pint in 13 hours. I'm fucking scared. And I know this is long so if you read all this I really appreciate it.

EDIT TO ADD I've only held onto my leftover oxazepams for emergencies. Which is maybe a couple times a month. Don't come for me, I'm not taking them regularly. (Probably shouldn't have been relying on them at all, but if I was in any control I wouldn't be here.)",4,0

They tell me that I have every right to leave him now (which I know that I do) and that I have no ties to him (we’re not married, we don’t live together, we have no children). Then I think of what got him here: his boss telling me that he was drinking on the job, owing money back to clients, the DUI he got and didn’t tell me about, the fact that this is not his first stint in rehab or even prison. 

The more I type it out and see it written down the more it hits me how hopeless the situation is, and how stupid I would be to stay. 

When is it enough? Am I crazy for willing to wait it out and give him a shot, because I want to picture our lives together five years from now, ten years from now, after we’ve weathered this storm? At what point is enough “enough”? Do I give him this second chance? Do I stay by his side?

Sorry, story this got long","My (66M) wife (62F) drinks a lot sometimes, seems like 2 or three times per week, almost always alone, at home, with me.  I don't drink; haven't since the year after college (age 23).  I'm retired, she works part-time as a specialized RN with great pay and benefits until she can get Medicare in a few years.  

She has some anxiety about sex, she won't explain what it is.  She loves sex with me once it's on, but she gets anxious making time or plans.  She is convinced that she needs 2.5 bottles of Aldi $3.00 wine to be like I want her in bed.  She's less inhibited when she drinks, but she's pretty great sober, too.   I don't get it, I just want her to be herself, ask for what she wants, and let herself enjoy the magic.   TBH there's not a ton of difference with or without the wine.   She's skilled and fun.   

She is a 5'4"", 100#, a very successful endurance athlete; bicycle races and endurance rides, rock climbing and obstacle course racing.

Three times in the last few months we have been in bed, during sex, when she started holding her mouth, like trying to suppress a scream.  She yelled ""STOP"" and ran to the bath to violently vomit until she was dry-heaving.   She says it's from her low blood pressure.    She is a highly trained, very specialized nurse for very sick patients; she recently her schedule back to 20 hours per week from 32.

Yesterday, Halloween, she came home from running ten miles, showered, and at 4:00 suggested a quickie.  We did.  It was fun and good for both of us. 

She brought home a 1.5 L bottle of 9% Target wine and opened it before 6:00 when Trick or Treat started.  TnT lasted til 8:00 and she drank about half the bottle.  Then we watched TV and she finished the bottle.  She had to work this morning, so she went to bed at 10:00 - we often sleep in separate rooms when she's working early AM.   At 11:00, she came to my room whimpering and said she was scared, and she's worried, she only weighs 99.2#, and got in bed with me.  She wanted to be held; I did and comforted her.  Then, she started coughing, ran to the bathroom and started vomiting like crazy.   That was miserable, but she composed herself around 12:00 AM and staggered off to bed; said she had to work in the morning.  

She came to my room this morning to say good-bye and said her BP was 95 / 58, inferring that that's why she got sick last night.

It seems obvious that she has a problem with alcohol.  She has, in the past:  Emptied all her wine and tequila down the sink.   Drank 2.5 bottles one night and said the next day that she is only going to drink once a week form now on.  Three days later, she had 3 bottles of wine and got sick. 

She's very medical and athletic, know what I mean.  She won't take my word for it that she's got a problem; can I get through to her.  

TBH, I don't like what alcohol does to people and I never envisioned my retirement as taking care of a drunk wife.  I am not going to be a happy camper if things don't change; so what do I do?",6,0

I noticed it starting in 2021 where after a drinking session when I wake up I'm like super depressed. Not suicidal or anything. But I feel like overwhelming shame. Like I shouldn't have drank. Even if nothing bad happened. Like a normal run of the mill night. Netflix, maybe a little headphones and music while drinking. But I'll feel depressed for at least a whole day or two afterwards now. A few months ago I was depressed for like an entire week. I know drinking isn't really ""good"" but it never bothered me like this before. I always looked forward to drinking and enjoyed doing it and felt relief after I did. Like it was a stress release. I don't know if it's because I'm aging or just alcohol taxing my body over the years, I don't know. I know alcohol can cause so many problems from violence to accidents.

I went to the hospital in early September for what turned out to be appendicitis, for 6 days. While I was there I finally decided I couldn't live drinking between a fifth and a liter of booze a day to self-medicate my depression and anxiety. It was the smartest decision I ever made to handle the dumbest decision I ever made: to drink 24/7for almost 2 years instead of facing my fears and getting help.  


 I'm on the road to recovery now, but I'm experiencing debilitating body aches and pains that make me walk like a 100 year old man instead of the young-for-his-age 50-year-old guy. I have some upcoming doctor's appointments so I am getting help and not relying on Reddit or the internet in general to self diagnose, but those appointments are weeks away and I'm worried...now. Did anyone else experience these aches and pains during PAWS? It's not a stabbing pain and there is no tingling or numbness — I don't think I drank long enough to cause neuropathy. There is no swelling or redness or tenderness to the touch whatsoever, so that rules out rheumatoid arthritis as well.   


I just feel like I got beaten with a bat after running 50 miles. Every joint and muscle just aches. It's not an infection because I was treated with antibiotics for the appendicitis and I had bloodwork done showing that my WBC was fine. I was mostly pain free during my detox, being treated with Ativan and then Librium at home for acute withdrawal. It was only after I ran out of the benzos that the pain really started to kick in, which makes me think it's just part of PAWS and I need to be patient, which is really hard when my mind is racing and my brain is struggling to get back in balance again and I'm cold one  minute, hot the next, feeling hopeful one second and hopeless the next.

End stage liver disease. Listed on her death certificate. It happened so fast. And I feel so guilty. We drank together so much....now I'm here with our boys.
