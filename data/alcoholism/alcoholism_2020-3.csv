Sleep terrified me because I was always afraid not to able to. I was afraid to lie awake for hours. The alcohol removed this fear and also made me more relaxed and tired.

It has kind of spiraled out of control. My tolerance has increased greatly, I'm always tired and my memory is laughable. The black out's keep increasing in lenght. I've already lost several friends, missed several great opportunities and put me quite a bit of debt.

Regarding the amount, I ended up (calculated to standard glasses) on about 15 to 25 units within a few hours.

People warned me for cold turkey, so I informed my doctor of my plan. Should the symptoms get to severe, help is just a phone call away. But should I really be worried? Mentally I feel little to no challenge. I have a family member checking up on me if it get's too intense. I'm motivated and feel good about this.

I didn't drink yesterday evening. I kept sweating through the entire night. I didn't sleep at all. Just didn't happen, whatever I tried. Soon, night no. 02 without alcohol. At the moment I feel pretty weird and keep feeling from freezing to boiling hot which goes back and forth. Headache, dry mouth, muscle pain, confusion. But it's pretty managable.

Is this only the beginning? Am I in for a wild ride? Or does that only happen to the far extremes?",3

I tried quitting a few times myself but it never really took. For about the past two weeks I've been feeling this sudden chest pain in the left of my chest.. only happens a few times a day and only lasts a few moments. Four days ago, I binged and in the morning had the chest pain again so I decided to try and stop drinking (attributed the chest pain to that).

First days' symptoms were really bad (no sleep, sweating, weird heart rythems). Next two days weren't actually that bad.. some headaches and lots of brain fog, but other than that nothing much.

I'm on day 4 now, and about an hour ago just had some kind of anxiety attack or something... huge brain fog, very heavy feeling heart beat, a bit of chest pain (same spot I've been having it for 2+ weeks). It seems to have subsided now, so now all I seem to have is the brain fog... 

Is it possible all symptoms are related to alcohol & withdrawl? Sweating and brain fog are symptoms I had before (in previous attempts to stop drinking).. is it possible none of the other symptoms are related to alcohol & withdrawl? I can't really go to any clinic or doctor, thanks to all this coronavirus stuff, so online resources are all I can turn to.

So I guess my questions are:

\- Is it common to have more severe symptoms on day 4 (or 5)? Rather than in only the first 72 hours?

\- I read online that brain fog can last weeks or even months.. does anyone have any experience/advice regarding this?",5

Ok. So I'm starting day 4 of my taper. Started at 15 and decreased and am now on 8 today. Yesterday I drank one beer an hour starting at 2pm and had about 10 (extra one because I started feeling weird). 

I had a video chat with my doc and he says I'm doing the right thing by slowly decreasing the amount of alcohol day by day until I'm done with it. He suggested so amongst this COVID-19 outbreak. Basically told me to stay home and I will be fine if I do EXACTLY what we discussed.

Why can’t she just stop drinking? She knows it is killing her, why not seek help? Does she even care about my feelings? Does she care about me? Does she even care about herself??

She eats little to nothing. She is so skinny. She doesn’t care that she is diagnosed with wernikes. Losing relationships with her kids does not even seem phase her.

She was hospitalized last summer after having horrible withdraws after not being able to keep anything down. After 10 days in the hospital, we finally got her to agree to seek treatment. She first agreed to 28 days only. Then made the decision for herself to stay 84 days. She completed the 84 days and said she didn’t even feel the “want” for alcohol. She claimed to be scared shitless and never wanted to drink again. She was so grateful for her experience. She was confident in herself. She was nice and healthy again. She didn’t even last a month after being home. Didn’t keep up with therapy. Didn’t get a sponsor. She paid 90k for the rehab facility she went to. NINTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. Did she ever “really” want to go/commit to sobriety? They say they have to make the choice for themselves for it to work. Has she just not hit that point yet?

She claims she knows she needs to go back, but hours later she will deny drinking even though I’m holding up empty bottles that i find.",3

The Beast is your animal midbrain. It is the part of your brain that wants only immediate pleasure — drinking, drugging, eating, screwing — with absolutely no concern for any resulting ethical breaches or long-term consequences. Although your Beast can't think, it has an astonishing ability to hijack your rational faculty and employ fallacious logic to get you to feed its destructive appetites. 

Here's how crafty and devious your Beast is. It can even take concepts that were designed to help addicts stay clean and sober and twist them into compelling excuses to drink or use. Talk about badass. Your Beast hears ""Addiction is a disease of relapse"" and tells you, ""See? You have a disease. Of course you're going to relapse. And if it's going to happen eventually, why not now?""

It should come as no surprise, then, that your Addictive Voice absolutely LOVES the current pandemic and all the resulting uncertainty. As soon as you saw that first news report, your Beast and the Coronavirus *instantly* became bosom buddies. 

See if any of the following Beast ploys sound familiar to you. 

* ""You're all alone, stuck in the house. It's a stressful time. Anyone would forgive you for relapsing now. They could be heartless not to. They don't know what it's like to be you.""

* ""Since you're now working from home, your boss won't know if you take a few shots or pop some Norco. It won't lead to a full-blown relapse or binge. But even if it does, you can regroup afterwards. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Besides, with the future so uncertain, what sense is there in looking too far into the future? You might lose your job in a week anyway. Meanwhile, why have a good time, or at least ease your suffering a little?"" 

* ""For God's sake, you've been laid off, your grandma could get the virus and croak at any minute, and now you can't even go to the movies or Starbucks to lick your wounds. You practically *deserve* a relapse under such insane conditions. Everyone says the coronavirus is a game-changer. No sense in ignoring cold hard reality.""

* ""You can't even physically get to your recovery meetings. Everyone knows if you stop going to meetings, relapse is inevitable. It's only a matter of time. Whenever someone in AA talks describes their relapse, they always say they stopped going to meetings in the preceding weeks or months. How can anyone expect you to work on your resentments and character flaws if you can't even go to meetings? When the pandemic is over and you have to explain your new sobriety date, sure, it'll be awkward. But they will understand. They know that addiction is a *disease*."" 

* ""You always told yourself if the world were about to end, all bets would be off and you might as well drink or use. Well, this could very well be the end. If not, it's something quite like it. Everything is in limbo. Could drinking really make things any worse at this point? Why not take advantage? 'Life is a cabaret, old chum!' 'Carpe diem!'""

* ""You are a Dual Diagnosis alcoholic — a very special type of addict. Even your shrink and addiction counselor said so. You tend to self-medicate. Anyone who had your mental problems would do the same. It's well known that all this isolation and uncertainty is exacerbating people's anxiety and depression. No one could blame you for self-medicating at a time like this. Besides, if you don't self-medicate, you might spiral into depression and kill yourself. Relapsing is bad, but isn't it better than death? You have to look at the big picture here.""

* ""All these memes and jokes and videos of people drinking and using during the pandemic are triggering me. Science proves that triggers are a huge cause of relapse — especially if you can't immediately run off to a meeting instead. Besides, why should all these other people get to drink or use while I have to endure my isolation and misery sober? It's not fair. Fuck it.""

Sound familiar? 

Always remember the definition of Addictive Voice:

""Any thinking or feeling that supports one's future use of alcohol or drugs.""

The way you deal with the Addictive Voice is to **recognize** that you are hearing your Addictive Voice, not your true, reasoning self. With this recognition comes power and objectivity. 

Use grammar to your advantage. Don't say, ""I am craving a drink."" Say, ""*You* are craving a drink."" Don't confuse your rational self with your animal brain. They are not the same. There are two of you. And you are the one in control. 

Above all, you **do not** engage in dialogue or deliberation or negotiation with your Beast. Many governments follow the policy, ""We do not negotiate with terrorists."" Your Addictive Voice is like a terrorist. It wants to bring your life crashing down like the World Trade Center, and for what? All for a couple of hours of artificial pleasure and relief. Don't get into long, agonizing conversations with your Beast. 

Remember: You don't negotiate with terrorists. 

Recognize Beast activity for what it is, reaffirm your Big Plan and your reasons for quitting, and then quickly move on to something more productive or healthy. It's that simple. Read a book. Listen to music. Watch a movie. Take a nap. Complete a task you've been putting off. Comment on a post (like this one!). You don't have to solve every character flaw or resentment or spiritual hole before you stay sober. No character flaw can *make* you move your hand to pick up a bottle or syringe and put a substance in your body. Only *you* can. What will you do? 

Stay safe, everyone. And stay strong. You are in the driver's seat. It's up to you. Embrace the challenge. No one, not even your Beast, can stop you.",95

Coming back that Christmas I realised she was having a glass or two of wine on Friday nights after work and would finish the bottle over the weekend - something which she tried to hide and lie about when I asked her... I got my sister to confront her because I knew if I asked her again she'd like again - and I knew that of she lied to me twice if never forgive her.

Come summer time I got a good job, and on my last shift before I went back to uni she was meant to pick me up at 3 pm. Instead she had taken the day to drink an entire bottle of vodka and lie in bed. when I got home I asked her what was up - she lied again saying she just had a long nap... But the room reeked. By now my entire family had heard about it - my sister called her earlier and thought she mightve been drinking it was my sister's anniversary and my mum was meant to babysit. My sister was hurt so my aunt came over and confronted her so I didn't have to listen to another lie. Anyway I went to uni a couple days later.

Now, I don't know how her sobriety has been over these past six months - I did come home for Christmas and she seemed fine. I had planned to stay in England over Easter and study for my exams, but the COVID-19 drama has her ordering me back home, she can tell I'm not happy about it but I booked my flights last night to appease her.

I realised since the summer incident that I resent my mother a lot - and I can bet that of I washed my hands of her that my life would be better. I might have a part of me missing... but that's something that many people can reconcile. Instead I am tied to her through family guilt. I am financially independent and could stay in England for all of summer.

I feel that independence it quite important to me and I find my self holding others (e.g. mates and peers) in contempt when they can't take care of themselves or get by. This independence might just be important to me because I don't feel I can fully rely on either of my parents.

Is my resentment valid or just inpatient? I honestly feel like I could save myself if I just cut the cord. Is it giving up on her if I do? Has anyone here done this? How did they feel after?

I drove 5 minutes and the cup of alc was in my cup holder, I drank a little and got somewhat buzzed. I turn to a side street and I see a sign (DUI checkpoint ahead) I freak out and make a U turn to get out of that lane. The second I did, I see a cop car behind me with lights on. I pull over, hide the cup in the back seat and think “this is it, I’m going to jail….” The cop says I shouldn’t have made a U turn, I said I’m sorry I have to get home to my sick mom…(lies). He said he wanted to make sure I’m not driving either drunk or high, I said absolutely not, I just got off work. He pulls out a pen and tells me to follow it with my eyes, after me passing that test he lets me off with a warning and doesn’t even give me a ticket for the u turn.
I feel lucky because if he did the breath test on me, I think I would be slightly above the legal limit and get a dui….Part of me feels so lucky and like this was a wake up call to get my sh.t together, the other part of me feels a need to do it again because I don’t think I’d hurt anyone, and do it but only at less risky times/less distance driving.

This is the first time posting in the sub.

As the title says my roommate will be leaving detox very soon. I'm looking for advice about how to manage my relationship with her because the last four days have been anxiety inducing. For context, my roommate was admitted to the hospital by me and had a blood-alcohol level four times the legal limit. Over the last four days she has been having auditory and visual hallucinations. The hallucinations were so bad it caused me to flee the apartment in fear. 

I want to be as supportive as possible because I know that alcoholism is a disease but I don't know if I am the person to support her at this time. I'm having a lot of anxiety about the idea of her coming back to the apartment but I don't want to punish her because she at least made the right choice of allowing herself to be admitted into detox. 

If I were to move out of the apartment she would have nowhere to go but I'm not sure if I can ride out our last 3 months of the lease with fears that she will relapse and another incident will occur. 

I gave her an ultimatum which is why she chose to go to the hospital, but even at the hospital when the social worker was speaking to her she wouldn't admit to drinking. 

I'm just looking for some guidance I'm sorry if this doesn't fit the rules of this sub.",5

I'm trying to cut down (not necessarily completely stop) because lately the number of days I drink has been creeping up, and I almost always get drunk when I drink. It's affecting my health, and drunk me thinks it's a perfectly fine idea to be up until 2:30am when I have to work at 9am.

Anyway I find myself by day 2-3 sober having a CONSTANT negotiation going on in my head. One minute I'm thinking ""no I absolutely don't wanna drink tonight, I can wait until the weekend"" and then 3 minutes later I'm thinking ""well as long as I'm in bed by X hour I can drink"" or ""I had an annoying day, I deserve to relax tonight!"" Or ""okay I can drink but ONLY if work out/do laundry first/etc.""

Honestly it's exhausting. It dominates most of my thoughts during the day, and the constant ""yes I'm gonna drink tonight"" and ""no, I definitely won't"" has my head in a constant state of whip lash. It's also really anxiety inducing, not knowing if I'm going to stop at a liquor store on the way home until I'm actually HOME.

Are there any tricks to just shutting my head the hell up? I don't want to argue with myself for hours in my head. I've gone to a few meetings, but I haven't really felt they helped, and generally the first thing I think after leaving a meeting is ""god damn I really wanna drink now.""",5

Looks like it's time to go cold turkey. How should I prep?,"I've gotten wasted every single night for about 3 years. I've been preparing to quit for a few months ever since a scary liver enzyme test result, and have significantly reduced my intake in preparation. But I'm still drinking a pint of gin each night. I have excellent insurance and planned to finish off my detox at a nearby inpatient center that specializes in this, but that's no longer an option given the virus. I also feel like the ER is off limits due to the virus. 

My doctor just emailed me and basically said, ""Detox immediately or I'll stop writing you prescriptions."" She and I had initially planned a tapering-down schedule, but she seems to have gotten quite concerned about my health and needs me to stop drinking immediately. As in tomorrow.

So, people who've been there before, how should I prepare? I live alone and no family members or friends can come by to take care of me. I'm well stocked on food, toilet paper, meds, and other essentials, and Mom is willing to drop groceries and meds by my door if detox lasts for weeks or months. Two of my prescriptions--Valium, which should help deter potential seizures, and Suboxone, which should help with pain--will come in handy. 

What should I expect in terms of symptoms? What will be the worst aspects, and how can I ameliorate them? Are there any foods, supplements, or anything else that might help with the suffering? I'm really scared.",2

He allowed it, listened to my reasoning, decided to let me as he said I've been really good when it comes to alcohol recently, and that I didn't touch the other bottles he forgot to hide. So we had a drink a couple nights ago, and he left all the alcohol out.

Hi I’m only 12. I really shouldn’t be on reddit (?) but whatever. I wanna talk out to somebody about my moms alcohol addiction but nobody to do it too so I guess reddit...

My mom is my most loved one in the world and she’s 52. She usually drinks wine and stuff and behaves super weirdly. My dad died from alcohol poisoning 4 years ago and I’m worried it might happen to my mom too

Also I feel anxious because I’m never sure if she is literally drunk or just really tired since she works much? 

Anyway she drinks wine and stuff when she thinks I don’t see and rarely she actually don’t. Those times are mostly when my brother’s or my grandma is at our house so that’s why I always get so happy when I hear they’re coming. But they don’t stay forever...

I hate my mom for what she does. Why the fuck does she drink like this? 

It all started when my dad died. She got OBSESSED with alcohol and probably was near death in a few days!!! She would be drunk 24/7 and skip job and stuff

But then, whole 2019 (almost) she stopped. No nothing. But it was like, literally at the year shift it all started. She began to act weird and stuff and I... well... try to sniff her to see if I smell the alcohol

I got F and E in a lot of grades recently cause I just can’t focus I get super afraid somethings wrong all the time!

I cry everyday for this and get stomach pains etc and idk how to stop it

I tried talking to her but she just got mad and said that UHHH DRINKING IS NORMAL FOR ADULTS

I have nothing to do! My brothers are 23 and 32 and both drink a bit occasionally but don’t get the same symptoms as my mom does. You can’t even notice on my brothers. 

What can I do? Can I talk to somebody here? Like pm or just chat? This has been going on for months and I plan suicide if this doesn’t stop soon. How can I prevent her getting time to drink? Just stay near her? That’s just weird!!!!!

Pls help thanks so much",71

I think that once the person decides to make such a polar change to their lifestyle some of those around them dont know how to take it almost, or seeing someone make such a change makes them look at their own faults and they dont like that. Alot of people cannot understand what it was like to live in addiction. I've had people treat me like I'm a piece of shit, and act like they are better than me bc they didn't go thru what I did. I am a pastors son, my father pastors a baptist church where the congregation is about 80-100 people where everyone knows eachothers business.

Reading people's body language and faces is not difficult, and I am almost shunned or not treated the same as others and it hurts, and I never wish to go back... Like they never made mistakes smdh... hypocritical to what jesus said on how to treat people... the apostle Paul killed Jewish wemon and children and GOD chose him so that just goes to say that past mistakes dont define you!!!  Some people make the assumption that since we went thru shit like this we are worthless, terrible, disgusting people and that is NOT true. They dont understand and have never lived thru this shit. I dont care what they think, I dont care what they say, I dont care how much trash and gossip they want to talk. I have nothing to prove to them. Everyday that I do better and rise up, the more they can get pissed off and proven wrong. I am getting happier every day and finding a new peace!! Slowly and surely I am becoming a different person. People change, I guess some people cant or wont accept that. Their problem...I wish I never went thru this shit honestly, but it has made me stronger.

I’m 20, and this is definitely my first post here as I’ve never considered myself an alcoholic. I do have addictive tendencies, but alcohol has only become an “issue” in the last year or so. 

Basically I’m drinking a handle of vodka in around a week, or sometimes a little over a week. I drink every night, usually shots or a mixed drink followed by shots. I drink a lot because I don’t really feel “drunk” anymore. I don’t have a gauge for what’s normal and what’s not, as my family is pretty dysfunctional and my dad attaches a ton of shame to drinking. I could go through a handle a year and he’d guilt me for it. 

Since I dont know what’s “normal” or acceptable, I was hoping for some input here. I know the amount that’s “too much” is different for every person, so I guess I’m wondering how you realized your drinking was a problem. I know the answer is usually if you think it’s a problem, it is. But I really like alcohol and find myself defending my use quite a lot.

My father, my uncles, my grandfathers, a couple greatgrands, all had issues with the bottle. I remember the first months, it was fascinating all of the different tastes and feelings. The summer after I turned 21 I worked two jobs. The original intent was to save money for college. But I blew everything I had made buying booze.
Fast forward a year and I had failed out of school (alcohol was not to blame, other mental issues were) and my fiancee left me two days before our lease started. I landed living with random people and one was also an alcoholic. He was a cool guy, but it was the worst thing that could have happened to me. I would routinely blow $100s a month on liquors. Some weeks I would spend $100 on alcohol alone. I wasn't just a drinker, but a picky one. If I could buy an expensive bottle I would.My coworkers eventually started talking openly, in front of me about how they always saw me buying alcohol after work.
A couple years later I didnt have a car and my habit kept me strapped for cash so I could never afford one. I remember spending cold winter nights walking to a nearby store to buy drinks. The cashiers quickly learned my face and couldn't hide their disapproval. My roommates constantly saw me walking in with more alcohol, and I would occasionally hear a muffled comment about it.
I have eventually gotten better. But I am still drinking 2 days to still every day a week. It litterally took a pandemic and the fear of how dumb I would feel getting sick just for getting more alcohol to slow me down. But I dont know if it will last. I really hope it does.
I dont just drink to get drunk anymore, because a lot of nights I cant seem to hit a buzz. But once a drink with alcohol in it hits my lips and goes down I feel complete. So many days I will not want to drink, but this part of me that doesnt feel like me will puss and talk myself into drinking.
I would give anything to be sober again. I dont remember what it feel like to live my life with out alcohol, and that scares me. I am worried abo uh t all of the abuse I put my liver through over the past several years. But the worst fucking part if all of this is, is that I half felt this way for years now.

And I am drunk right now. And all my body wants is more alcohol.",3

Joined a frat freshman year and learned a million drinking games and bad habits. I'm no stranger to the occasional night of binging.

As far as my drinking habits go, I probably average about 10 drinks a week. A beer with dinner a few times and a little splurge on friday. Maybe a few glasses of whiskey. About once a month the stars will align and I'll go get rip-roaring drunk with friends. Never black out but I may get sick. This has been pretty constant since my 21st a year ago, since now I have no restrictions on buying.

Never had any issues with the law, skipping work or school, avoiding responsibilities, etc. All of my friends and my father, when asked, have said that I do not have a problem. But drinking's a big part of college and my family culture so their definition of ""problem"" may not be accurate.

Here's the kicker. I have anxiety, worsened by this pandemic. I worry a lot about my health. I sometimes become fixated on an irrational belief that I have a condition. Last fall I was convinced I had diabetes despite working out 6 days a week and only felt relief after having bloodwork done. Many of the questionnaires about alcoholism are about personal feelings. (IE: have *you* ever wondered if you should cut back?)

Long story short, I cannot trust myself to answer a question like that. I was whole heartedly convinced that I had either diabetes or a brain tumor in the past year. Further more, I can easily go 2 weeks or more without drinking. During that time, I feel no strong urge to drink. Drinking doesn't cross my mind unless it's hot out on a Saturday afternoon and I think ""yknow what sounds great? An ice cold beer.""

However, my stupid brain has convinced itself that I'm having alcohol withdrawals. I keep telling myself that I just don't drink enough to experience withdrawals, and that compared to others I have the habits of a mormon, but there's still some nagging fear that I'm just in denial and that I'm slowly sliding down the path to destruction.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I'd rather ask those with real experience. I love myself a good whiskey or a cold beer and it'd just be a real bummer if I had to give those up.",5

I've gone only one day without booze at a time and that's been very rare but problem-free when it has happened.  Just one day though, as I recall. 

Don't have a doctor I trust to give me advice on this.  Tried Nal but had very bad side effects. 

My options as I see them are 1. try cold turkey anyway 2. try Nal on much lower dose 3. try to figure out a working strategy on cutting back (because willpower and self-motivation has not worked)

I turned 18 in January and haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in fear of inheriting the alcoholic traits my mother has. She is drunk nearly every day and has said that she can’t seem to help herself, she’s been to rehab many times but nothing has worked. 

I have been to a couple of social events and people have offered me drinks that I’ve declined in fear that if I touch alcohol, I will inherit my mum’s alcoholism. I’ve tried to search it up on the internet with conflicting evidence, so does anybody know here whether I have a chance of becoming an alcoholic? I hardly want to get drunk as the images of seeing my mother drunk are burned deep into my brain and that’s turned me well off getting inebriated, it would be more for a social thing while retaining complete control.

I wish I listened to myself before this virus. This is hard to admit, but yes, I am an alcoholic. I'm not going to go into my full history, but long story short, my new year's resolution was to quit drinking at home alone. I have anxiety and depression issues that I will be talking to my therapist about, though I can't afford more than every 2 weeks. I have daddy issues, which I think are the root of my mental health problems.

The reason I am writing now, is that despite my acknowledgement of my problems, I cannot shrug off this need for alcohol. I've been at home for 4 days now, yet I've binged on alcohol twice. I do my yoga, coffee, exercise routines for a few hours, but after 3-4 I am lost on how to keep myself busy. I cook, but only once or twice a week, and last time I cooked while drunk.

It's hard enough to be sober during this pandemic, being an alcoholic is so fucking hard for me. I need help thinking of ways I can keep myself sober, I don't know what to do.

I can't be the only one struggling with sobriety during this pandemic, please let me know what you all are doing to curb these drinking cravings.",5

I like drinking a lot, but know it’s a road block to much better things. Please tell me it’s worth it to completely quit.  Honestly, it’s shocking I’m not dead or in jail by now. I haven’t done anything really bad in a few years, but I know that side of me is still in there. I am also afraid that if I don’t give it up and never look back, then eventually, he will emerge again and who knows what will happen that time.

Not only because everyone is ordered to stay home but my symptoms of withdrawal are so bad I think I need to go somewhere where they can help me.  

First off, I have been to two ERs in the past 1 and 1/2 weeks and they said they couldn't help me/ give me anything.  I told them my whole body was on ""fire""/pain and I was seeing and hearing things that were not there and puking every hour as well as not being able to eat.  One of the doctors even said that it was not a symptom of alcohol withdrawal.  I left that hospital early or without clearance because they said they couldn't give anything to help me.  

I understand corona is keeping hospitals and clinics busy but I really want to get better but I need medical help to do it.  I have tried riding it out and I have been scared I am going to have a seizure and/or my heart gives out trying to get off alcohol because it thumps so bad.  As well as wriggling in pain so much. 

I have been drinking about 1 1/2 gallons daily for about two years now straight so when I stop, my body wreaks havoc on me.  And I don't wish to die from this stupid addiction.  But when the withdrawals happen, I certainly feel like dying the pain is that bad.  Kindling is getting super bad now I think.

Its even my birthday in two days and this feels like the shittiest birthday present.  I want to get better but I feel like a combination of corona and medical people not seeing the seriousness to do something that makes me stay home and suffer under potentially serious conditions.  No offense to corona virus it is a serious problem. And at this point my husband is sick of my alcoholism indefinitely.  I want to be normal again without drinking from a bottle to do so.  And I want to stop for good. And stop hurting the people I love. The rehab clinic that takes my insurance are not taking patients for a while as well so I feel a little helpless right now.

TLDR Thank you for reading.  I just needed some one or people to listen since I can't go to meetings or classes because they are all cancelled due to corona.  I am not a talker so this is cathartic to me.",3

I mean I go to parties like my friends and maybe I tend to be the one totally drunk in the group but that's not to say I'm an alcoholic. I know that I can get really crazy when I'm drinking sometimes(been in arguments while drunk and tried to start a fight once) but isn't that normal behavior? People get into arguments with their friends all of the time.

Sometimes I can start drinking a little early on in the day(about 12:00 o clock cause around lunch time) but it's usually just depending on the amount of stress during that day. I wouldn't say I always get ""drunk"" but I do love the feeling of a good buzz when I'm stressed out.

I've been having about 4 glasses of Vodka a day generally, I'll have two in the afternoon and 2(sometimes 3)when I come home. 

I go like actually real drinking only about 4 times a week? But it's not like I'm always alone, however I do enjoy some time alone to just kick back and relax and enjoy a glass or two when I come back home.

I love vodka, which I know people say is really strong but honestly I never felt that way I just love how it gets me warm inside. I'm kind of shy so before I go to a social event I usually will have a drink before I go, it's not like I'm drinking to get drunk or anything just to loosen up a little (I'm against drunk driving) one drink never hurt anybody and alcohol can actually have some health benefits.

I know when I start drinking it can be hard for me to stop sometimes but that's only because I like enjoying the moment and unwinding.  I've only blacked out a couple of times but I promised myself not to drink that much again. My memory can be kind of patchy but not a total blackout I still remember bits and pieces.

There have been times where I've had a drink the next morning to help get over my hangover but it's not all the time, and I had good reason. I can't just be so hungover I can't concentrate on anything for my classes and job.

I wouldn't say I can't stop drinking, I just like it. Does it really seem like I'm an alcoholic?",3

I had called a couple of times the last few days and spoke to the nurse (loved her) who let me know he was doing great and let me in on some jokes he was cracking so I felt good hearing that much even though I couldn't hear from him.

When we finally got to talk yesterday all went well. He was feeling positive and optimistic, was moving out of detox earlier than expected and was looking forward to it. We talked about the kids, life, what bills need to be paid, taxes, how the animals were, what we were up to, what are plans were, COVID-19, all the every day stuff. He even got to call for an unexpected second time because the nurse was curious about an inflatable water slide company I had talked about that was running a great deal because of all the self isolation stuff going on. I had offered to let him talk to the kids but he said he preferred not to, which I felt was okay and understandable right then.

Since the kids are out of school for a month and their spring break camp has been cancelled, I decided to get them an inflatable water slide (as mentioned above, so he knew of his plan) since the deal was pay for one day, get it for three. Our backyard isn't big enough but my mom was lovely enough to allow us to use her yard while eating all her food for the next few days. Well, he was able to call again today even though we didn't think he would be. I sensed our whole call that something was wrong. He seemed like he was rushing off the call the entire time while I was clinging to every second. The call lasted 45% of the allowed time. He was excited to tell me about how good the food was there and I did ask him to talk to the kids quickly since they had been expressing how much they wanted to so he did their hello's and love you's and went about their business.

I'm unsure if it was because we were all there having fun, if it's because he misses us, if it was just all too much for him, or what, but I *know* something wasn't right. FWIW - I had stepped away from everything so we could talk so it's not like it was in his face (ear I suppose) The call left me feeling icky and empty and like my heart was sinking into my gut while trying to hide tears in front of everyone.

I guess I'm just wondering if I should be expecting some distance from him during this time? Or perhaps some insight on what he might be feeling? I know how I feel but I can't put myself in his shoes since I've never been in them myself. I know he needs my support yet I miss him and wish I didn't have to feel this up until I get to talk to him again. He may have no idea what the impact is on me as much as I don't have the best understanding of what the impact of all of this is on him.

Any similar experiences/advice/suggestions are welcome. Thank you.",1

I drink to make it go away, which is only temporary and then the next day the anxiety is worse. I have a prescription for Xanax, and unfortunately I have taken it daily for about 3-4 months. (about 2mg per day) I am splitting the Xanax into 3, .5mg doses per day to slowly taper off of it. (1.5mg per day for now) Right now mentally I am in the worst place I've ever been. All I do is constantly obsess over the bad things in life, not being able to perform in the bedroom, doom and gloom 24-7, etc. I've never had any experience with alcoholism so if you have any advice or have experienced this stuff I could desperately use any and all tips/resources to taper off of alcohol. I am not sure I could stop cold turkey. Thanks in advance.",7

Over this past year he has gone into detox twice and got out of a 30 day rehab about 3 months ago. Once he got out, he lost his job (for missing so much & drinking on that job before going into rehab) that he had to make some major life changes. He moved states to where I currently live and got a new job working for one of his best friends. Well last weekend he invited me over just to hang out and get dinner and when I showed up it was very clear he was drunk. I looked through his bags and found two bottles of vodka. When I called him out on it, he pretended to have no idea where it came from and said it was from before rehab (clearly not true). I was extremely upset and dumped it. We talked for about 15 and he kept telling me that he’s a loser and I should hate him. He said that he has no reason to live except for his kids so that’s why he is still around but also said he is not suicidal. He is not in a good place financially and has been divorced twice and is very depressed. When he woke up the next day, I told him we need to make a plan. I told him to go to AA and to meet with a therapist but he keeps telling me he is too busy. It has not been 5 days and he has not done a SINGLE thing to change his situation. He won’t even really talk to me about it. Just tells me he is ok and that this was a wake up call (which he has said before). I also found out that his boss found a bottle at the office and that his brother in law (who he is living with) found him with alcohol a few weeks ago. Where do I go from here? I don’t know how to support him but also create boundaries. If something were to happen to him I don’t know what I would do. How should I help him?",2

We don’t live together and we kind of broke up a month ago because of these patterns. He asked me to be patient with him but now he’s not responsive and I can tell he’s using again. Not sure what to do and looking for suggestions. Do I need to let him struggle through it on his own? I often try to help him avoid the rapid decline into a full on relapse. If we “kind of broke up” do I just wash my hands of him and his addiction. Feeling torn because I do care but also don’t see a future as he’s hiding his behaviours again and not dealing with things.

I’m 20 years old I’ve always suffered from severe anxiety and rapid thoughts, because of that I’ve been daily binge drinking for about 2 years now, but had my first drink at a very young age. It’s always been the only thing to help me clear my head.. I’m very functioning, I work 40+ a week so my parents don’t even know the extent of my problems (they’ve caught me a few times before)  all of my friends know I’m an alcoholic, but since I handle myself pretty well they don’t know how serious my problem truly is, I go through two 1.75 liter bottles of whiskey In a week usually (sometimes more) I’ve tried going sober quite a few times over the last year, every time I went through the daytime sober I dealt with cravings but nothing I was worried about, when the sun went down I would always crack because I can never wind down without a drink, if I ever somehow went to bed sober sleeping was out of the question, I would try and go to sleep but every time I just start to panic I end up tossing and turning for 3+ hours, constant thoughts and shaking, trouble breathing, horrible sweats.. I want to get professional help, but I simply can’t afford time off work to go to a rehab, I understand I’m very young, but im worried a dangerous withdrawal might possible for someone of my age. I really wish I could just quit cold turkey, but it’s very hard. I know this was very long, but this was my first time being honest about my problem to anyone so I had to let it all out, I would really love if someone could give me some tips about getting sober rest and dealing with the withdrawals",15

We both are career oriented with well paying jobs so on paper, we’re successful.  I love this person so much and when he is sober, he is an excellent partner. 

He drinks every day but usually not to a scary amount. Every week or two he drinks atleast one day to the point that he becomes terrifying.   He will be incredibly mean, act irrationally and honestly downright scary.  I have hid out in bathrooms, bedrooms and even my car.  He never remembers his actions from these times once he is sober.  

When he’s at that point, it’s like talking to an angry, manipulative wall.  There is literally no recollection once he is sober again.  Is this a hopeless situation? Is there any help he can get?  What resources should I look into?",2

I kept telling myself it was because my birthday was coming up and I was celebrating (and depressed). Then it was because I was on a mini vacation (and depressed). Lately, it's been because of social distancing and being bored (and depressed). I stocked up on wine and already went through it in two days. I would probably be drinking even if we weren't being asked to stay inside but the isolation makes it feel like the weekend, which is when I drink the most. I tell myself to not drink during the week because of work (mostly successful) and then go wild on the weekend. But, like I said, it's been a month now. 

I keep thinking it's not that bad and that I don't have a problem. But it's been building up for a while. I've wondered if I might have a problem since I can't just have one drink and because I think it'll make me feel better when I'm depressed. 

I guess my question is: what are y'all doing to distract yourself and keep yourself from giving in?",10

I have this female friend who I met a few months ago. We became fast friends, super close and sharing deeply personal thoughts together. I always had a small crush on her, however, and I fucked it up so badly that she blocked me and texted me telling me to never speak to her again. Yep, it was that bad.

I expressed my feelings for her one time and she said she saw me as a wonderful friend but didn't have romantic feelings for me. I decided to continue trying to be friends because I genuinely did like spending time with her. We were able to go back to our normal friendship and it didn't seem like she minded at all.

But then I guess two nights ago I got really drunk, and on Instagram I saw her hanging out with another guy friend. I guess I got jealous and started posting to my Story about how annoyed I was, she demands my attention all the time but doesn't like me, yada yada. I also tried facetime calling her a bunch even though she was declining them.

Anyway I deleted the message threads out of embarrassment without reading them, but she wants nothing to do with me ever again and I'm really sad about it. A really great friendship that meant a lot to me, gone after one night. She was who I would always confide in when I was sad, or happy, or whatever — now i feel so alone. I would pay so much money to be able to take that night back.

This isn't even the first time I've done this with a girl I liked before. I've been blocked in the past by another girl for drunkenly harassing her online too. 

TL;DR got drunk, posted a bunch of videos on instagram complaining about how a friend of mine I'm attracted to doesn't like me back",3

It’s a socially acceptable vice, and now I find myself a 31 year old functioning alcoholic wanting out of this party.","The hardest lesson of all my addictions has been to let the party go on without you. It’s the hardest thing to do and the absolute best thing for you, biologically and socially and personally. 

I learned this lesson once already kicking heroin, and I thought that was my lowest point but no. Heroin addicts hide you don’t normally see them in your day to day life. Alcoholics like me function directly under and around the umbrella of normality. Suffering in broad daylight in the presence of everyone is absolutely worse. And suffering in self enforced silence being able to throw up a facade good enough to keep them away another day or more... it is an affliction. 

I want out. My partner downplays the effects, but he’s just an addict at an earlier stage. Such denial I feel nostalgia for. I felt I had it under control. So wrong I was.

I feel too young to be feeling so old. I am aware of the biological affects alcohol is having on my body. I’m 30 pounds overweight (it’s like carrying a 3 year old child all day every day) I can’t breathe at night I must prop up my head to align my respiratory organs, I can’t run for any length of time I tire so easily (I used to run 8 minute miles five years ago). I’m irritable when I used to be jovial. I’m still quite positive for others, but at the end of the night I’m combative even in absence of drinking.

On Friday, I relapsed (made a post while intoxicated) and pretty much lost every aspect of my life I deemed to be important. I lost my girlfriend (the best woman that's ever given me the time to get to know), I lost my job, I lost one of the best friends I've ever had, and I lost a stable environment I chose to be where I grew as a person. After losing all of this is when I decided to relapse, and I dropped everything to move back home. Things have been weird since I got back .. no hugs, no ""are you alright?"", no ""do you want to talk?"" Only silence and tension. They're planning to provide me with an intervention tomorrow and I just don't know how to react. Did I hurt the people I truly care about so much that they no longer trust me to handle this problem on my own? Did I present such a toxic environment to our relationship that they now just want to get rid of me and let someone else handle my problems in their own right? Of course this isn't my immediate thought process and I realize that I do need professional help, but why is it that they couldn't confront me? I've been asking my father for 5 years now to help me find out what I need to find out in order to go through a rehabilitation center. Everytime the answer was something along the lines of ""it's all in your head"" or ""keep your mind focused and you'll no longer feel as if you have these problems."" I've been paying for my own shrink, prescriptions, and attending many support groups without their knowledge. Do I continue with this secret and agree that I'm lost without saying anything, or do I fess up about the treatment and see if they still would prefer me to go through said rehabilitation process. Twenty-thousand dollars is a lot of money.

If you feel like there's nothing left just remember .. ""Growth, like love or sleep, happens to us slowly at first, and then all at once. Stay the course, and trust the process. You are always closer than you think."" Thanks for the written support and I'll provide an update once I'm through detox.

This morning my boyfriend told me that last night I broke several plates and glasses and threatened to kill him if he touched me. He said I was talking about a time I was assaulted when I was 15 and that I said I was going to kill all men and chop their genitalia off. I do not say these things when I’m sober.

drinks I have to have 8 or 9. I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back and I think drinking makes it worse. Until today I always thought I was just the funniest friend and that everyone was boring because they didn’t drink as me. But after last night I think I might have a problem.

I asked him how much and he said he’s had one bottle of wine which was finished and in the recycling bin. 

After going upstairs there is another half a bottle of wine missing which he has now finished off and moved onto Vodka. I heard him rummage around in the alcohol cabinet but when I asked what he was drinking he said it was just OJ and had to push him to get him to admit there was vodka added to the OJ. 

He is currently banging around in the kitchen trying to put the plates away, he’s just smashed one and is cooking some food and I’m now paranoid he is going to leave the oven on, like he did last time this happened. I would imagine there will be noises going on, keeping me up until he falls asleep on the sofa. 

He tells me he lies about how much he drinks because I judge him - which I sort of do. Fridays/Saturdays/special occasions I tend not to judge him unless he really goes for it (a few beers washed down with and a bottle of vodka) but it’s a normal Monday night!!! 

Any advice, guidance or experiences would be most appreciated. I’m at a loss at whether to just let him continue to do this, he is an adult after all, or to sit him down and have a proper chat.",1

My mom has battled wit alcoholism my entire life, even before I was born. This past week she has been gravely sick (jaundice, puking, diarrhea, etc). She absolutely refuses to go to a hospital or doctor. Today, I called 911 because she couldn’t get out of bed. They couldn’t do anything because she was denying symptoms and her drinking and she was unwilling to go. They strongly recommended she needed emergency care. 

My question is—can I do anything to help her? Get her to the hospital? Would that even help? We’ve put her through every treatment imaginable, nothing ever stuck. What can I say to her? Any advice helps. 



Also, please know how sorry I am to all the people and families affected by this. It is the biggest battle I can imagine. Keep fighting.",1

I have a family friend who I’ve known for a couple years now. He is in his mid twenties, has alcohol related seizures multiple times a week, and is basically a dead man walking. I know there’s nothing I can do to help him as he needs to help himself. He is extremely resistant to opening up and being honest about his feelings and struggles. All his “friends” and even some of his family members enable his alcoholism even though he likely has irreversible brain damage, and at the rate he’s going, will die within the next couple of years, if not much sooner. Basically everyone talks about his issues and how they feel helpless behind his back but no one will actually confront him with his own reality. What little friends he has maintained, want to help him but are just shut out. I know this is pretty common with those struggling with addiction and mental health. 

It’s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to get a packet together of available resources for him because that’s honestly all anyone else can do for him at this point. He went to rehab about five hours from here, where his dad lives, then stayed with him instead of living in a half way house. However the moment he moved back home, he immediately relapsed. He has been to MHMR (county services) and should be following their crisis program. However, the only reason he is following their program is because a Mental Health Deputy will be knocking on his door if he doesn’t appear for his counseling, case worker, or psych appointments. I’m looking for groups, medical facilities, and any form of assistance where a team of people can teach him the skills he needs to figure this out. It’s really quite dire at these point.

Thank you so much in advance. I wish all you lovely people joy, healing, and strength. You all are doing such great things to improve your health and spirit. I wish for each and every one of you that you reach the light at the end of the tunnel.",2

Need Advice.,"My mother recently relapsed after almost a year sober. I spent Christmas with her and my sister, and I really regretted it. I had a horrible time. She's an angry drunk, and she says such hurtful, hateful things when she's drinking.

She's had a problem with alcohol, to a greater or lesser extent, my whole life, It's always been something of a struggle, but it's only after almost a year of being able to have a relationship with my mother as she could be - kinder, less erratic, and most importantly, HAPPIER - that I really feel that I'm not capable of putting up with it any more. It's just too exhausting.

I know my mum is sorry and ashamed, but that doesn't really help. I haven't seen her since Christmas. Tonight she messaged me, inviting me to stay with her while my workplace is shut due to the coronavirus, and I told her, truthfully, that I have other plans. But I can't keep putting off the decision forever. I don't live far away. And what I really wanted to say to her was, ""I won't set foot in that house if you're going to be drinking.""

Is that a bad idea? Will it help or worsen her addiction? Complicating the matter is that my mother refuses to use the ""A"" word, even as she acknowledges that she needs to quit drinking. Alcoholics are people who can't hold down a job and who collapse in pools of their own vomit behind seedy bars at 3 o'clock in the morning. Not hard-working middle-class people like her. So I don't know if an ultimatum will only serve to make her dig her heels in.

Thank you all in advance, and I wish you all the best in your fight.",5

He was a personal trainer when we met and I knew he liked to drink and lived very much the “work hard play hard” lifestyle but it didn’t seem like an actual problem. Within a year it was clear the drinking was more than that of a normal person, and he’s a very bad drunk (not physically abusive but definitely verbally, and can get aggressive with other men) we ended up getting engaged and he promised things would improve, they didn’t. He lost his job, gained weight which made him feel worse about himself and that just made him drink even more. I stuck around for another year and a half begging, pleading, offering help, booking doctors appointments, everything I could before leaving and whilst he didn’t take it well and the first 4 months or so were very tough, he eventually seemed to sort himself out.

He got back in touch 11 months after the breakup and he seemed to have changed, more stable job, much less drinking, working out again  and back to the same old happy Jake I fell in love with. That was December. Since then there have been at least 4 times where he has seriously crossed the line with drinking, but he drinks in excess without fail every weekend. 

This weekend I’m in self isolation with suspected corona. I have weakened lungs from childhood asthma and whilst unlikely deadly, it could be dangerous for me. He went out Friday night “for a few pints” and I took a turn, almost ended up in hospital and I couldn’t reach him. I called him at 3PM Saturday and he was slurring down the phone clearly still drunk. He knew I was upset with him but proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day and then get drunk and go out again Saturday night. 

He doesn’t remember what happened, the whole weekend is a blur. 

I’ve ended things but he’s begging me not to, he says that this is the wake up call he needed and he’s going to get help this time. I said I’ve heard it all 1000 times. He’s called me in tears begging me for one more chance because he can’t do this without me. At this point I don’t know if I’m helping or enabling and I feel like I’m drowning myself trying to save him. 

I just need some advice from people who have been there, what helped you? I can’t carry on like this but I don’t want to abandon someone that needs me either.",1

November 3rd 2018, I entered a 90 day recovery program in Columbus, Ms. I think the obvious truth is that I was afraid.. I had never been to rehab. Like most recovered alcoholics, I had to hit rock bottom to realize I was destroying my life. I pushed all the people that loved and cared about me away. 

It hurts when your friends dont want to have any thing to do with you any more. Your family only calls to make sure that you are still breathing. Evan my cat slept in the other room because at night I was so rowdy and beligerant. One moment I was happy-go-lucky. Then the next I was angry-violent-suicidal. 

Today I have rid my self of that obsession and have begun to live a purpose driven life. Ugh humbled is about the best I can describe this experience. 500 days sober! 

I decided to start a channel on YouTube. We are asking addicts of all kinds to be completely transparent and to tell their stories of addiction. It's almost a HOW TO channel about sobriety. I'd really love some feedback. If you all think the message is clear. If the videos are worth watching. I hope we are reaching people in an honest and genuine way. Let me know! Is this a good idea?

Hey everyone, before I get into the question of this topic, let me provide a crumb of context. My partner and I have been together on and off for nearing two years now. During this time, he has coped and tried to overcome alcoholism. And I’ll admit, I haven’t been the most helpful person when it comes to such things. 

In the past, I would become angry and disappointed due to some of the things he’s done and said while drinking. I also would have little patience as I felt like I had to treat him like a child in order to take care of him while he’s drunk. 

My whole life, I’ve never been raised around good role models for drinking responsibly. I’ve had old friends in high school who are now alcoholics. The town I was raised in had a huge problem with drunk drivers killing high schoolers and other people at least a few times a month. So I’ve never had a proper example of what drinking responsibly is like nor have I been taught how to talk to someone about their drinking problem. 

Now, presently, my partner has corrected their drinking problem (kind of). But last night, we were at one of their friends houses drinking, and my partner had way too many beers. My partner ended up being overwhelming, and I was tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. I tried my best to be patient, but my patience wore thin. Everything they did began to bug me, and I started to blame the alcohol once again. They ended up becoming very frustrating during the whole night, and we woke up and had a bit of an argument over the whole thing. They had to go off to work, and we decided we’d talk about it later. 

But that’s the thing guys. I don’t know how to talk about it without getting upset and disappointed and angry. I don’t know how to go about this. Please give this stupid redditor some advice on how to talk to their partner about alcoholism.",2

I am a daily drinker at a pint or more a day. This has been going on at this rate for a couple months. I've been drinking daily overall for the last 6-7 months.

A couple weeks ago I started getting random numbness feeling in my left foot and leg that I brushed off as a potential injury from moving things. It comes and goes. A couple days ago I started getting blurry vision and sparks/flashes in my vision like floaters (similar to looking at a camera flash light or the sun by accident and looking away and seeing dots) and that would come and go. Around 6 hours ago I had a few shots of vodka and ate a sandwich. Well not long after I felt heavy and numb and a brain fog clouded my head, and my vision started to blur. It made me very anxious to the point I had an anxiety attack. I ended up puking. My friend tried talking to me and I had trouble interpreting her as if I had confusion but I knew she was talking and I could respond it just felt really passive. Afterwards, I still felt heavy and more exhausted. I felt like I was going to lose consciousness. I had an orange juice and some pretzels and started to feel a little better. The feeling of anxiety attack went away for the most part, but I still feel odd after the ordeal and a bit confused. I am currently back home and I feel extremely tired and my vision is still a bit weird and my foot feels kind of numb. I have a random pain in my left side that I'm not sure if it is related. I just overall feel really exhausted as I'm typing this. My friend told me it could be low blood sugar. Sometimes I would get similar symptoms as I did earlier when I wake up and I figured it was just slight withdrawal because I would also feel shaky so I would drink and they would go away temporarily. This has been going on for a couple weeks.

TL:DR- Heavy daily drinker. Suddenly got blurry vision, heavy, and nauseous. Similar symptoms to low blood sugar. Ended up puking. Feel exhausted.",5

While he is definitely making some sort of attempt to control his drinking, he's still drinking a good bit daily and still drinking while at work occasionally. Granted he's not gotten blacked out or puked in my car for a couple of weeks now, I'm still having trouble trusting him about it at all. Several times in the past he has gotten black out and the broken up with me over stupid shit, only to conveniently forget about it by morning. He claims he doesn't want to break up or anything but I find it hard to believe that. So now I just feel it is almost impossible for me to actually trust him about anything at all. I'm always suspicious that he's at least had a little to drink and sometimes he's honest when he has, other times he's a complete liar about it. The more obviously wasted he is, the more likely he is to lie about it. 

He's sometimes really difficult to talk to about things like this. He gets very defensive, rarely apologizes,  and is just aggravated anytime I try to bring up past actions.  He acts like I'm just supposed to forget it all ever happened and just move forward, but that's hard to do when it has happened so many friggin times.   

I can't afford to do therapy right now, so can't work on it that way. Wondering what others have done to start trusting their alcoholic partners again. Also, no I am not open to any sort of alanon meetings.  I get they can be helpful for some, but I'm not one of those people.",3

I created this account only to vent my fears of it.,"Ill try to make this short, basically I love to drink like most my age. My grandmother is currently and has always been an alcoholic, my grandfather was once one, my uncle is one depending on the phase he's going through. My father chooses to drink in moderation out of fear and he definitely has control, but, has also shown he could become like them if he was on the wrong path. Then there is me. I have always been fine with or without alcohol. Ever since turning 21 I kind of went a little wild. I now psych myself out. If I am not entertained, I want to drink cause why not. I am fine going without it like I said, if I am busy. It holds me back from accomplishing fitness goals or smaller things I want to do in the day because I am lazy the next day or feel like crap. I don't always drink to get drunk but 75% the time I am. I find the excuse to get drunk 3-4 nights a week. If I didn't have this family history I wouldn't be worried but still, I shouldn't drink like this. The fact that I even have these scared thoughts makes it feel like a problem. I care so much about health and fitness and day time-im fine because I am busy! but night comes around and me and my boyfriend get bored, so why not sometimes? Then on top of all this I have about 4 friends I consistently hangout with and 3/4 I only drink when I hangout with. Basically I just want advice on what everyone thinks! Like I said I psych myself out- I will be thinking ""i actually don't want to drink that's not fun and doesn't make me feel good"" then the other half of my brain is like ""just do it you'll feel great its fun"". I also am becoming more socially awkward because I feel the need to drink to hangout with people.  I get super excited to drink too, it's ridiculous. I see someone else who drank 3 times in one week (which they probably never do) and so i feel like i can too.  I'm scared I am headed down a dangerous path. Thanks for any help/opinions/anything.",2

So do I, on occasion.
However, any time we have a bottle in the house, he'll polish it off in about four to five days. I'm lucky if I get a single glass out of the bottle.
I've said something to him about this a million times, and he's said everything from, ""Alright, I'm sorry, I'll slow down"" (and then doesn't) to, essentially, ""Keep up!"". 
Umm, no. I shouldn't have to RACE to get more than one drink out of an entire bottle before it disappears. It should last more than four days.
Here's where I wonder if I'm overreacting: We don't constantly have whiskey in the house. We've gone a week or two with nothing. He also shows no noticeable changes in behavior when he drinks, and he stays home (i.e. doesn't drive anywhere or anything).
What's driving me nuts is that we've had this conversation no less than six times. Nothing changes.
His family is full of alcoholics; as is mine. I've brought this up to him, and I've told him I'm not comparing him to his alcoholic relatives or mine...but he definitely has an addictive personality (tried to quit smoking once started having full on drug withdrawal symptoms: Puking, headaches, etc.), so it's a slippery slope I'm worried about.

Am I worrying too much about this? Please tell me if I am; I wouldn't have posted this publicly if I couldn't handle the feedback.",1

I had a small detox period and was doing great again, but my mother was just admitted to hospital with a severe infection coming from a tiny little cut on her right index finger.  It's spread, very quickly through her hand and into her arm, and they fear there might be sepsis, in her blood.  She isn't doing well now, and I can't be there with her, because where I work, I'm exposed to all kinds of possible infectious things, and she is on isolation atm.

So I'm sitting here, at home, freaking out.  She was already not well, COPD, CHF, renal insufficiency, and HTN.  So this could be bad, in a big way.  The call to run to the store and grab a metric fuck-ton of alcohol, and drink till I pass out is loud, and I don't know how much longer I can resist.

I know it won't help me, or even more, won't help her, but I don't know how else to stop myself from overthinking it and freaking out.

Any ideas, please?",1

We have talked about rehab here and there for the past year and he really started to express interest this past month. After some heart to hearts, bad nights, repercussions of actions, the physical affects getting worse and worse, and all that stress catching up to him, he decided he's ready and asked me to find somewhere and get him in. 

He was really sick from it yesterday but he had some beers in the evening. Last night was the worst I've ever seen him. I was up with him most of the night because he needed support. He was anxious, hyper ventilating, talking about all sorts of topics, overthinking, he said he felt pressure in his head and his eyes were killing him, etc. This morning I found him a facility that accepts our insurance and got him all setup. He's been in bed all day and is really hurting. He asked the counselor if he could go on Friday. 

Here's my current dilemma: The rehab called back and said they can't take him until Sunday morning but he could go to a detox center for a week and then get transferred there. I haven't mentioned this to him yet since he is resting but does anyone have any suggestions based on experience what would be better? Should we just wait and have him go on Sunday? Or should we get him to the detox on Friday and have him transferred the following week? I've seen him sick before but never like this and I am fearful of what could happen in the next 2-4 days. 

I'm open to all suggestions and/or advise on how I can best support him until he goes and during and after treatment. What is my role in this process? What worked for you and your spouse/loved one? Thank you in advance!",4

I've made progress, having finally admit it to close people in my life, and have been sober for a couple days now. The next issue however, is that I'm pretty sure I'm going through withdrawals now. I've had withdrawal once or twice before, and I waited it out, but this one has me scared, as does the idea of going to the doctor to make sure this isn't my end. I know it's for the best, but it's scary to admit these things and that I could be going to the doctor and it's just a mild withdrawal or that I've nearly killed myself.

I was drinking everyday and switched to the hard stuff (not good). So my last drink was yesterday morning when I got home from work, I had one beer left and I drank it and thought I would be able to sleep. I couldn't so I ended up staying awake.

At around 5 pm last night I just had a feeling something was wrong. A tightness in my throat and chest and all I could think about was here we go. By the time 9 pm came around I was pacing around my house like a lunatic just trying to control my breathing and i was forced to call out of work (i work nights). So I muscled through the first night but knew if I was already this bad it was going to get much worse. Swallowed my pride and went to the hospital.

When I woke up in the hospital I met a man who told me this time I was lucky and next time it might kill me and that I needed to get help. Thankfully they didn't keep me overnight and I was able to get some sleep. Each time you withdrawl it gets worse and I don't think I can survive a third time, not with the way my chest felt. So I have to start today, I am an alcoholic and I can't let it kill me. thank you for reading.",5

2020-03-10 00:50:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fg8j5m/my_ex_is_starting_aa_soon/,My ex is starting AA soon.,"So I recently broke things off with an amazing girl who, when drunk, is the worst person I know. 

I love this girl very much and I can't stand the way she acts when she's drinking and because of that I had to break up with her. Breaking up with her was such a hard decision due to how much I love being with her when shes not fucked up. I'm still very emotional about this and have gotten about 3 hours of sleep over the past 2 days so I apologize in advance for the poor formatting and the inevitable run on sentences.

Anyways this was my first real relationship because I dont really count high school ""relationships"" everyone else I've been with sexually has been more of a FWB or a one night stand after a party. But everything was different with her and at first it was awesome having someone I could have sex with, hangout with, love, and not to mention buy alcohol for me (I'm 20 and shes 25)  But these past few months the drinking has just gotten old for me but not for her. I've lost count of the times shes gotten blacked out drunk and we've gotten in a fight only for her to not remember all the shitty things she said to me the next morning. 

This past Saturday I had enough after she was shit faced before 7PM and she told me to leave like she has before when shes drunk except this time I did. I grabbed all the things I could in one trip and left to go to my bestfriends house where me and my bestfriends girlfriend talked and cried all night about everything. 

One thing she said that stuck out to me was ""I know you say that shes awesome when shes sober but we've never met her sober"" and then it all really clicked with me. 

The following night I went to my dads house to hangout with him and his friends and one of them asked if I was still with her and he said ""Good."" 

None of these people know her. The real her. The sober her. The girl I fell in love with.  

I told myself that this break up would be easy. I thought I would walk away just fine. Turns out I can't. I tried going to work today and all I could think about was her so I sent her a message laying out all my feelings and all the way shes done me wrong. Her response was ""come fucking hold me"" I told myself I was done. But the next thing I know I was telling my boss I had a ""headache"" and I needed to go and then I was on my way to her house. 

I told myself that this would be the last time going there. I told myself I need to separate myself from the entire situation but I just couldn't. After a long time crying, having sad break up sex then more crying she told me that she wants to go to AA meetings and that shes sorry for everything. I dont know if I can believe her but since she doesn't have a car I told her I'd take her to AA meetings but it'll be a long process if we want to fix our relationship. But right now I have hope that I'll get that sober woman that I fell in love with back because I've missed her so very much. 

Sorry if this was the wrong place to post this. I dont care if nobody reads this I just needed to vent and I dont want to bother my friends with it anymore. 

TLDR; Fell in love with an alcoholic, alcoholic treated me like shit, broke up with an alcoholic, still love the alcoholic, just want to help the alcoholic get help and hopefully have the relationship we should've had from the beginning.",5

 I was sitting here thinking about the time I woke up with horrible pain in my throat like it had been burned. I had been drinking. God knows how much.

I noticed a big red stain next to where i was sleeping, but was too hungover to care. I wiped it up and forgot about it.

It just dawned on me that I vomited red wine and liquor in my mouth while laying on my back too drunk to awoken, and probably choked on it. The acid DID burn my mouth and throat, hence the awful pain.

By some miracle, I turned over and spit it out.

Anyway, end story time. You got this ❤️",4

Had an empty container of vodka in his car and refused a breathalyzer. Apparently he was wasted. His brother bailed him out. It was his third DUI. Which is a felony in our state. And unfortunately his last DUI had yet to go to court. I'm in a state of shock, his family is in a state of shock and we are trying our best to figure out how to help him, etc. He hid his drinking from all of us. I only see him once a week, every weekend, and he barely touches a glass of wine. I recently found out about DUIs 1 & 2 I had told him that I could not be in a relationship with him until he admitted his problem and got help. That conversation happened last Saturday and a week later he had another DUI. He is still not admitting he has a problem. He called me tonight from jail, first time we have spoken, and I told him please not to call me and to focus on himself and his family and figuring out how the hell he was going to deal with all of this. This is a deal breaker for me but I'm feeling tremendously guilty. Maybe I was too harsh? Our relationship was already strained and almost dead, he knew and I had given him an ultimatum. I will support him from behind the scenes, supporting the efforts of his family. I want to help him but maybe I'm doing it all wrong by being tough on him. I don't know.",5

2 months ago, my husband found my secret stash of alcohol,  and so I was forced to stop drinking.

i live in an abc store state, where you cant buy liquor on sundays. i didnt budget my weekend bottle of booze right and spent the second half of yesterday bummed, until i decided that it was ridiculous how dependent i am on alcohol to regulate my mood and that i needed to quit for good. no one drink a day max, no weekends only. i expected this morning to be hard because of the time change but honestly i feel excited and refreshed and here's why ....
- i will be able to eat nice foods now. no more bread straight from the bag in an attempt to prevent a hangover, or tuna for every lunch because i don't care enough to pack lunch the night before. 
- i can practice music without being embarrassed about how sloppy i sound
- hopefully i'll be able to wake up with the first alarm rather than hitting snooze a bunch of times, and my mornings will be less stressful
- not passing out on the couch every night = less back pain, better skincare routine, more restful sleep.
- less anxiety over the damage i'm doing to my body, plus i'll be able to build muscle 
- fewer blood sugar crashes

I have a friend of 17 years, and he's been living with me as a roommate for the last eight years. I rely heavily on him for moral support because there are times in life when it gets hard and I get depressed. I had texted him a couple times and he didn't respond. Last Tuesday I went downstairs to check on him and he said that he was barely able to get to the bathroom and he was stuck in bed. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he just felt sick. About 2 hours later I went downstairs again to make sure that he was okay and he said he figured out what was wrong with him. He said that the symptoms he was having coincide with alcohol withdrawal. So I learned that he stopped drinking on Saturday prior to the Tuesday when I spoke with him. On Wednesday I went downstairs and checked on him, and he was sleeping so I figured I would let him do so. On Thursday he asked for some sugar, and some salt for gargling and something sweet to drink. That night I spoke with one of my other roommates and he told me that Amy Winehouse died from alcohol withdrawal and we should keep an eye on him. Yesterday while I was at work I asked my roommate to go check on him and he said that my friend was non-responsive but he thought my buddy was asleep. When I got home from work at 5:20 p.m. I went downstairs and looked in the room and he looked like he was dead. I looked at his chest to see if it was raising and lowering but it wasn't. I called 911 and after the first responders came I found out he was dead. I've never discovered a dead body before and right now I'm feeling angry and sad. The ultimate irony of all of this is that the thing that killed him is the thing that would have kept him alive. The coroner said that he had multiple organ failure and she had been dead for about 16 hours. I don't know where to put any of this. As an intj I pretty much have rationalized it to the point where I believe he's in a better place because his life was rather difficult and tragic but there is a part of me that feels callous and cold for not being emotional enough.",3

I honestly kind of ignored it from the beginning. He would drink and his attitude completely changed. He’s very caring towards me when he isn’t drinking and as soon as he’s drunk he would get really aggressive and even spat on me one time. Finally when I broke up with him he swore he would never drink again. Of course a week later he was drinking but he wasn’t drunk. It’s been a lot of times he tells me he’ll stop drinking like that and calm down, which he has A LOT. But he still has been drinking and driving, if he gets “aggressive” it’s just stupid arguments because he is angry or I don’t even know. Lately he has even been lying to me when he’s drunk but I can tell that he is and he says he isn’t. 

He still goes to work and mostly only drinks at night. But he drinks every day and sometimes it’s just three but he doesn’t have a high tolerance. Every night he constantly has to get high or drunk which has been bothering me. He works weekends so it’s mostly during the week that he drinks. It’s mostly one night or two that he is sober at night. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have stopped drinking because we would have so many arguments when we both drank but now I realize that it is him. He gets annoyed sometimes now when I ask him if he’s going to have another one or if he’s going to buy beer again. Or if we go out and he insists on driving after having a couple of beers.

While I no longer do hard drugs, I know I drink way too much (I turned to drinking as a way to deal with cravings when I stopped using). Now, I no longer use it as a coping mechanism, but mostly because I have very poor impulse control. If someone offers me a drink, I have a hard time refusing. I'm just used to drinking.

This is where the roommate comes in. We're both heavy drinkers, and have been pretty much since we started living together a couple years ago. We cut down for a little bit, but now it's getting bad again (i.e. getting drunk every night). 

Now, I stick to just getting drunk at night, and only when I don't have to get up early for work the next day. Not an excuse, I know that I still drink too much and it's unhealthy, but I say this to show contrast with my roommate. 

He'll get drunk with me at night, and then if there's any liquor left over the next day, he'll drink the rest of it in the morning. He's shown up to both school and work drunk multiple times now. I'm worried. He's also going through a lot of stress in his life right now, and I'm concerned that he's using getting drunk as a coping mechanism. 

I want to sit him down and address it - we both need to stop this. But I'm worried about how he'll take it - he really doesn't like being told what to do and what not to do. I want him to stop too because 1. I'm really worried about him and 2. the poor impulse control. When he buys a bottle of vodka and it's just sitting on the kitchen counter, it's really hard for me to resist drinking. There have been some nights when he gets drunk and I stay sober, but it's difficult for me and doesn't happen too often.

Does anyone have any advice on how to address this? I really want both of us to get better.",2

More so my dad but my mom hasn’t been doing well either the past 10 yrs. Dad drinks approximately 20 bottles of bud light a day. Mom drinks vodka straight up, 3-4 shots a day. I’ve spoken to both of them multiple times stressing how this is ruining their health. Mom has Crohns. Dad has high blood pressure. They’re both health conscious concerning food. Which makes it even harder for me to understand why they keep living this way. 

Mom says she’s cut back and I do believe her. 

Dad was laid off from a company he had been at since he was 18, 2 years ago. He’s had 2 short term jobs- nothing atm. So mom has been taking care of all bills for 2 yrs. She recently started cleaning for a second job. Dad isn’t attempting too help. Of coarse this is straining their marriage. I try desperately to not bring up their drinking as it only starts drama. 

Where do I go from here?? Do I just stay away? In the past I denied them visitation with my kids which resulted in them not talking to me for a month or so- but no change. I’m watching my father ruin his marriage and body; I can’t watch anymore.",3

Do you have any withdrawal symptom handling tips? Anything that helps you when the physical symptoms get too bad but you HAVE to quit?

2020-03-05 20:04:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fe5jgy/twelve_steps/,Twelve Steps,"   

I penned this a while back. It’s a story – fiction, obviously – but I hope it applies. Let me know if it puts AA in a bad light.

**Twelve Steps**

Danny knew he had made a mistake in coming, but he took a seat nonetheless.

All of the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting on his side of town seemed warm and welcoming. All of the people were friendly and knew him by name. There were hugs, handshakes, slaps on the back. The rooms were well lit with comfortable chairs. There were always freshly baked cookies or donuts.

A recent falling out with his sponsor, Ralph, had caused Danny to choose to avoid some of his normal meetings, though. He had already been down to two meetings a week, which Ralph had so poignantly called him to the carpet on, so he didn’t want to cut those out completely. He had been feeling antsy lately and probably needed to go to a few more. Never the type to ask for help, he was unwilling to admit it, though. Instead, he decided to try a few meetings on the other side of the tracks. Whitehall. The seedy part of town.

Fucking Ralph. “You’re only as sick as your secrets,” he said. Danny had made a list of all those he had harmed, and went about making amends to them all. Some accepted his apologies, some didn’t. All he could do was clean his own side of the street. There were fa few amends that were impossible to make, but he had admitted all of his sins to either his sponsor, his therapist, or his priest. All but The One Thing, that is. That’s what Ralph kept harping on. Danny had stayed sober for fifteen years. He deserved to keep The One Thing to himself, didn’t he? Fucking Ralph.

Danny chose a group with the innocuous name of “New Hope” that met in the basement of Saint Pete’s Episcopal Church. While groups sometimes did actually meet in church basements, they were rarely as depicted on television or in the movies. That’s just not the way things worked. Hollywood had gotten the coffee and donuts part down to a tee, but missed the mark on most of the rest. Sadly, there weren’t even any donuts at the “New Hope” group. Danny wished that he had known. He would have sprung for some. AA had given him his life back, and brought a good bit of financial security with it, so he didn’t mind giving back now and again.

He made his way over to the coffee urn, making eye contact with a few people on the way. He didn’t even bother to smile. The most he got were some grunts and shrugs as he walked by. He had already decided that he wouldn’t ever be coming back to this group, so why bother. He wasn’t about to walk out, though. Giving up was for losers. He grabbed a Styrofoam cup from the top of the stack, which already had some black smudged fingerprints on the outside, and filled it with a sludge that they called coffee here at Saint Pete’s.

Danny threw a buck into a basket on the table and plopped into a chair that seemed to be farthest away from everyone else. This was nothing like the usual meetings he hit. The church’s basement room was about forty by forty feet square. There were eight rectangular folding tables set up in a makeshift circle with wooden chairs set along the outside. Unfortunately, there would be no speaker. This was a discussion meeting. They would most likely read something out of some bit of AA approved literature – the Big Book, Twelve and Twelve, or some meditation book – and then go around the room weighing in on their own personal experience, strength, and hope. Danny didn’t feel like talking, but the one bit of his sponsor’s advice that he had latched onto early was to always say something. Always be “part of.”

Even though the ceiling held banks of fluorescent lights, the room still seemed cold. Perhaps it was the type of bulb they used. (Were there different types?) Or perhaps it was the way the light reflected off the sickly yellow linoleum floor and institution-green walls. It smelled funny, too. Oh well, thought Danny, it’s only for an hour. He had spent twice that amount of time scraping together change for another bottle while fighting off the shakes in the past. In comparison, this would surely be more pleasurable than that.

That’s what it came down to, wasn’t it? For him, to drink is to die. There were times that he had done the most disgraceful things in order to get drunk. Things that would have sickened him if he had been sober and not fiending for the next drink. So if sitting through a boring meeting in a crappy place meant not drinking, even for only an hour, then so be it. Not a difficult choice.

He was not a snob, but the thought that the people here seemed to be a little lower class than what he was used to. He was by no means rich, but now that he had gotten his life together, he was back in the upper-middle class demographic. The meetings that he attended were regularly frequented by businessmen, doctors, realtors, and other professionals. Frankly, even the blue-collar people at his normal meetings seemed to be upper class compared to these people. These people were… and he had to remind himself that he was being honest and not uncaring… the dregs of society. Unshaven, unkempt, tattooed, greasy, foul smelling.

AA had taught him not to judge. “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” Still, it was hard.

Just before the meeting was called to order, a man plopped down into the chair next to him. Oh, come on, buddy, thought Danny. Ten empty chairs, plenty to keep enough distance between all of us, and you have to sit right next to me. He sighed. At least this guy seemed friendly.

Short, stout (PC for obese), with a red, round face, he introduced himself. “Hi there! Name’s Mike! How ‘bout you?”

“Danny,” he said as he extended his hand.

At least Mike was dressed well. Button down shirt, slacks, dress shoes. He was even wearing cologne. Or was it the smell of booze? No, Danny decided, it was cologne. The guy’s breath smelled bad though. Not “smelled” as in “drinking” smelled, but just reeked. His teeth seemed white enough, but it was as if he hadn’t brushed in ages.

Mike tried to make small talk. “I haven’t seen you before. So how long have you been coming to these meetings?”

“About sixteen years,” replied Danny. “I came in for a year, and then decided that I wasn’t ready to stop. I went back out for a while, and have been sober ever since. Fifteen years, one month, one week, and two days.”

“Wow!” Mike seemed truly amazed, “How many minutes?”

Danny just smiled.

“Me?” Mike continued, “Me? I’ve only been coming for about a month now. I’ll have thirty days on Wednesday.”

“Well, congratulations. For some people, those first thirty are the hardest. Real white knuckle time.”

Mike was definitely pink clouding it. That’s the term for AAs in early sobriety who think that life has suddenly become wonderful and carefree. After a good period of sobriety, it kicks in that drunk or not, life still has challenges. There’s just no more alcohol to make the bad feelings go away.

“I’ll be getting my chip.”

Mike was of course referring to the colored aluminum medallion that – although not universally used - has become almost synonymous with AA. Sobriety coins themselves do not help people stay sober as such. It's the meaning behind them that is important. When a person receives a coin for one month, three months, or a longer period of time, the coins give a sense of pride for staying sober as long as they have, and to motivate them to continue. If a person should feel the desire to drink again, they might finger the coin in their pocket to remind them of all the headway they have made up to that point. It makes them ask themselves if they truly want to throw away all that progress. Danny never liked the chips. He would occasionally step back and remember exactly how much sober time he had – remember that last drunk vividly – but he didn’t want a constant reminder. He felt it would make it easier to ask the question “Has it been long enough? Am I cured now?”

The conversation was surprisingly pleasant enough, but Danny was happy when the meeting began all the same. Same old, same old. Business first, then reading, then around the table sharing. When eight o’clock rolled around, the chairperson indicated that it was time to close, and they joined hands for the Lord’s Prayer. AA is not a religious organization, but saying the Lord’s Prayer at the end is sort of a tradition in most – but not all – groups. It’s a sign of unity, if nothing else. Danny really didn’t plan to stick around for fellowship afterwards, but he always stayed long enough to help clean up. However, before he got to the door, Mike cornered him.

“Hey Danny, am I going to see you around here again?”

“Eh,” Danny creased his brow, “Probably not. I live on the other side of town. I just stopped in here tonight because… well, it was just convenient.” Danny guessed that had not technically been a lie. AAs had to be careful. “Practice these principals in all of our affairs.” Lies paved a slippery slope.

“Oh,” Mike seemed dejected, “It’s just that they say to get phone numbers – you know, to call for when you feel like drinking – and I was wondering if I could get yours.”

Danny’s shoulders relaxed a little. “Of course, Mike. That’s never a problem. Never feel like you can’t use it.” Mike wouldn’t use it. Most of the newbies never did. Danny pulled out a pen and jotted it down in the back of Mike’s meeting pamphlet anyway. “There you go.”

“Thanks, Danny” Mike shook the pamphlet. “I will definitely use this. You’re a lifesaver. You guys are great.”

Mike bounced away. Danny made his way out into the parking lot and slid behind the wheel of his 2012 KIA. He said a little prayer for Mike. “Hope he makes it.” Who knew? Maybe being at that meeting was God’s way of putting him in the right place at the right time.

Danny rolled through the Burger King drive-thru on the way home to pick up an artery clogging dinner. He just wanted to flick on the television, eat, shower, and get into bed. It had been an exhausting day. He had barely pulled into his garage when his cell phone began to jingle. Danny finished parking, unbuckled his seatbelt, and answered the phone right there in the front seat. It was an old habit – probably not a healthy one – but he just had to pick up the phone when it rang. He could not bear the thought of someone leaving a message. He had heard stories of AAs who were never able to get through to someone, and things didn’t turn out well. Once their faith in the system was broken, especially the newcomers, they didn’t trust it anymore.

“Hullo.”

“Danno! It’s Mike!”

“Uh,” Danny shifted the phone to his right ear, “What’s up, Mike?”

“Oh, no no no. Don’t worry, Dan. I’m not thinking of drinking. Just wanted to test out the number. Practice call, you know? They say to get used to calling when you don’t need to, and that way it’ll be easier to call when you do need to. Right?”

“Um, yeah Mike. That is a good idea.”

“So what’s up?”

“Um, well, not a whole lot since I saw you. I just drove home. That’s about it,” Danny said with a smirk on his face. “I’m about to have some dinner and then it’s off to bed.”

“Oh, okay,” Mike replied. “You go have your dinner and have a great night! Maybe I’ll talk to you tomorrow?”

“Sure, Mike. Tomorrow.”

Danny showered, toweled off, and padded into his bedroom. He slid into a pair of silk boxers and fell into bed. He didn’t imagine that he’d have any problem sleeping – he was physically exhausted – but as usual, his mind raced a mile a minute. He was never able to fall asleep without the radio turned on, even when about ready to pass out. His head would hit the pillow and the stinkin’ thinkin’ would kick in. That’s how Danny discovered the wonders of talk radio.

Dialed in to a pundit recapping the day’s news in a soothing voice, Danny pulled the chain on his bedside lamp and plunged the room into darkness. The pillow was cool. His stomach was full. His mind had calmed. Sleep began to…

Danny phone jingled. He propped himself up on one elbow, used the remote to turn the radio off, and grabbed the phone from the nightstand. Its screen had lit up with the number of the incoming call, but he didn’t recognize it. It wasn’t a name that had been programmed into his phone. Danny briefly considered putting the phone back down and letting it go to voicemail, but he knew that he would not be able to sleep until he heard the message and, more than likely, called whomever it was back.

“Mmm,” Danny sighed, “Hello?”

“Danny.” Mike sounded grave this time. “Sorry to call so late. I mean, I know you said that you were going to hit the hay, and I didn’t want to bother you, but…”

“S’okay, Mike. Go ahead.”

“Remember how I said that I’d be getting my chip in a couple of days? Yeah. I can’t believe it’ll have been a month already. You know, the day I took my last drink was a special day.”

“Every day is special when it’s your last day drunk, Mike.”

“Yeah, yeah. But, I mean special. It was the anniversary of… Well…” Mike began to get flustered. “See, my wife and I, my ex-wife that is, and I lost our daughter that day.”

Danny swung his legs out from under the covers and sat up. “Oh, I’m sorry.”

“Oh, don’t be, Danny. It happened a long time ago. Long time ago. It would have been her twenty-first birthday,” Mike trailed off. “So long ago. The denial, the depression, the sadness, the anger. I started drinking afterward and just never thought to stop. Until now, that is.”

“That’s a long time to be stewing in it, Mike. Do you want to talk about it?”

“Nah, Danny. No sense dredging up the past. Not when I’m doing so well.”

“You’re only as sick as your secrets, Mike.” God, Danny hated it when his sponsor was right.

“Yeah, yeah. Maybe when I’m feeling a little more stable, Danny. Maybe I’ll talk about it then. I’m just not doing so well right now.”

Danny spoke with Mike for about half an hour and, when he was convinced that Mike was over the urge to drink, let him off the phone and promised to meet him the following day. He lay down his phone and swung back under the covers, a smile on his face. What was it they say? Even if Mike went out and drank that night, at least Danny stayed sober. Help yourself by helping others. Danny forgot to turn the radio back on, and that night, he dreamt about The One Thing.

Danny awoke to the sound of his phone. It wasn’t the alarm tone, but the ringtone. Another phone call. He had come to recognize Mike’s number by now. This was getting a little annoying, but sometimes that’s the way it went. Mike would either fall off the wagon soon, or he would start to make new contacts. In the meantime, Danny would just have to deal with it.

“Good morning, Mike.”

“Dan, my man! Good to hear your voice.”

“Yeah,” said Danny, scratching at the back of his head, “It’s been like… six or seven hours now, huh?”

“Oh, yeah. I’m not bothering you, am I?”

“No, no.” Yes, yes, though Danny. “So how did last night go? Didn’t drink, did you?”

“Nope, and I owe it all to you Dan.”

“Well, Mike, you picked up the phone and made the call. So you can give yourself a little pat on the back. That phone can seem real heavy when it stands between you and a drink.”

“Ain’t that the truth? So, are you hitting a meeting this morning, Danny?”

“Um, no, Mike. I have a job,” Danny tried not to sound ticked off. “I have to work today. I promise that we’ll get to one tonight. You pick it out, and call me back around six. Okay?”

“Got it, Danno. Six! Talk to you then.”

Danny’s worst fear came true. Three more calls during the day. Mike had picked a group called “As Bill Sees It,” on Danny’s side of town. Danny decided that he would need to have a talk with Mike that evening. Calling when in need, or even for occasional friendly support, was fine, but there was such a thing as abusing the system. You know, the boy who cried wolf sort of thing. Danny was about ready to throw his always-answer-the-phone policy out the door.

Danny didn’t look forward to the conversation, and had a rough time forcing his dinner down that evening. He wasn’t hungry but, as usual, he tried to keep his stomach full. “HALT” Hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Four things an alcoholic never wanted to be. Any of those could be a setup for another drink. As he was finishing his second hot dog, wrapped in white bread with ketchup – just as he liked them – his phone rang again. He checked the screen. Fucking Mike. Again. He decided that he wouldn’t answer it, and let it go to voicemail.

Seconds later, it rang again. Didn’t that guy get the message? Danny let it go to voicemail again. Another few minutes passed, and it rang again. Danny wondered if Mike had changed his mind. Maybe he couldn’t make it to the meeting after all. Still, he let it go to voicemail. Thankfully, more minutes passed and Mike did not call back. Danny felt like a heel, but he just couldn’t deal with it anymore.

At around a quarter of seven, Danny tied his shoes and gathered his wallet and car keys. As he headed toward the door, his phone jingled. Mike. This time, he answered.

“Hey, Mike. I’m headed out the door right now.”

“Oh thank God, Dan!” exclaimed Mike. “I couldn’t get a hold of you, and then I started to worry… I wondered if maybe you went out drinking again, I… I…”

“Mike! Slow down, buddy.” Danny was beginning to let his temper get the best of him. “Would you...? Oh, look. Just wait for me at the meeting. Outside! We need to talk.”

Mike was breathing more regularly now. “Oh, Danny. You really had me going there. Well, anyway, you can ride with me.”

“What?”

Danny strode out of the back door and pressed the button to lift the garage door. As the door rolled up, it gradually revealed a battered, green Honda sitting in the drive. Mike sat behind the wheel with the engine idling. Danny was taken aback. He walked briskly up to the driver’s side door and motioned for Mike to lower the window. After a moment, and with a confused look on his face, Mike hit the button and the window glided down.

“What’s wrong, Dan? Hop in. I thought that maybe we could ride to the meeting together. Then, maybe grab a cup of coffee after, huh?”

Danny was fed up. “No! No, Mike! No meeting, no coffee after. I don’t have time for this. I don’t know what to do with you. You cannot keep calling me. How the hell did you even find out where I live?”

“Oh, uh,” Mike looked shamefacedly, “I guess maybe I, uh, followed you home last night.”

“What the hell?!”

“Sorry, Dan. I’m new at this. I really don’t know how it works.”

How it works. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. Danny thought it over and softened.

“Okay, Mike. Here’s how it works,” he said calmly. “I’ll come to the meeting, but I drive there myself. We talk a little. After the meeting, I come home. Alone. No coffee. No more calling, unless you really need to – like ‘I am going to drink’ need to. Are we clear?”

Mike looked a little hurt, but replied, “Okay. Clear, Danno.”

Danny got into his KIA and followed Mike to the meeting. They sat next to each other, but Mike was uncharacteristically quiet. Afterward, they separated in the parking lot with nary a word.

“See you tomorrow, Danny?”

“Maybe.”

“Oh, hey,” said Mike, “There’s a candlelight meeting called ‘Nite Owls’ tonight at the… Oh, right. Sorry.”

“Tomorrow, Mike.” Danny stressed.

Danny thought that Mike may have gotten the message, but just in case, he turned his phone off for the evening for what was probably the first time in years. That night, Danny had a nightmare about The One Thing. 

Danny pulled himself from bed and showered in the morning, and had almost forgotten his phone. Still wrapped in a towel and with damp hair, he walked over to the nightstand and turned it on. He returned to the bathroom as it went through its boot up process, and then he heard a message tone from the next room. Hmm. Wonder who that could be.

Six missed calls from Mike. One two voicemails, four texts. “Thanks for coming, Dan,” “Sure you don’t want to go to the meeting?”, “Great meeting – shoulda been there!” and “Need 2 talk.” Danny didn’t want any confrontation today. He turned his phone back off, dressed and left home. He knew – just knew – that Mike would show up at his door after not receiving answers for long enough. He planned to not be there. Even though it was a Saturday, he would hang out at his office. There was a couch there. He could take a nap if need be. (And he did need it after the previous night.)

He felt silly and demoralized. It was his own house, damn it. He was being chased away from his own home by… well, a stalker. Should he talk to the police? No, he decided. He would talk to his sponsor first. Not daring to turn his cell back on for fear that it might ring in his hand; upon arriving at his office, he picked up his desk phone and dialed in Ralph’s number. Ralph was no help. At least, he didn’t tell Danny what he wanted to hear.

“Just suck it up, Danny. I’ve had my share of pigeons who either tried too hard or didn’t try hard enough. My guess is that this Mike guy will turn out to be one or the other. Why don’t you bring him along to tonight’s meeting? I’ll meet you guys at the ‘Acceptance Group’ tonight. Maybe I can have a talk with him.”

“Yeah, I suppose.”

Danny turned his cell back on in order to call Mike and invite him to the “Acceptance Group” that evening. Six missed calls, and it was barely noon. He sighed and began to scroll to Mike’s number when the phone jingled. Danny didn’t even need to look at the number to know who it was.

“Hi Mike.”

“Danny! I tried to…”

“Yeah, I know Mike. I’ve been at work. I just turned my phone on and saw that you had called.” An icy thought ran down Danny’s spine. Did Mike know where he worked, too? “Anyway, my sponsor suggested that I introduce you to him tonight. We’re going to Saint Andrew’s to a meeting called the ‘Acceptance Group.’ Want to come?”

“Are you kidding? Do you even need to ask? I would never pass on the chance to meet my sponsor’s sponsor. He’s like, what, my grand-sponsor?”

Whoa. Danny thought about it, and never had the talk of him being Mike’s sponsor come up. A sponsor is a recovering alcoholic who has successfully made some personal progress in the AA recovery program. He or she is asked by another AA member to take on the individual responsibility of sponsorship. A sponsor shares their experiences on an individual and personal basis with another alcoholic who is trying to achieve or maintain their own sobriety through the AA program. They help the person focus and navigate through the stages of the program. The relationship between an AA member and his sponsor is usually a pretty close and intimate one, and not gone into lightly. Not only does an alcoholic need to carefully choose a sponsor, but also the potential sponsor must cautiously decide whether taking on a sponsee is prudent.

Danny gave him the benefit of the doubt, though. Mike was new at this. “Hey now, Mike, I’m just another alcoholic willing to help you out. I’m not really in the right state of mind to sponsor anyone.” Not until he rid his conscience of The One Thing, anyway.

“Oh, okay.”

“Don’t feel bad, Mike. You’re new. You’ll catch on to how this works.” Then Danny had a thought, one that might rid him of Mike for good. “Ralph has really helped me out. Maybe he’d be a good choice for you to consider.”

“Eh, he won’t be the same as you, Dan.”

“You’d be surprised. We’re all the same in one way or another. Promise me that you’ll keep an open mind.”

“Okay. Anything for you, Danno.”

Danny hung up and texted directions to the meeting. Then he turned his phone back off. He decided on trying to catch a little nap, after all, and so curled up on the couch in the reception area of his office. He drifted off almost immediately, but it didn’t last long. He awoke screaming and in a cold sweat just forty-five minutes later. He felt his face and realized that he’d been crying, also. He had dreamed of The One Thing. Why had thoughts of it returned, and in such force? Fucking Ralph. He brought it up and started pressing Danny. That would make sense. Although, Danny had a feeling that Mike had something to do with it. Guilt over avoiding him? Constantly having to look over his shoulder and avoid phone calls? Or perhaps the fact that Mike had lost his daughter. Danny pushed The One Thing to the back of his mind once again, and decided to cross the street to McDonald’s to get in at least one meal before that evening’s meeting.

Danny had to cross a four-lane street in order to reach McDonald’s. It was the middle of the afternoon, clear weather, and – being a Saturday – there was only light traffic. He absentmindedly glanced both directions and crossed, not bothering to walk to the corner and wait for a signal. He was about halfway across when, seemingly out of nowhere, a car came racing at him. The driver was noticeably straddling the double striped centerline of the road, and overcorrected when he noticed Danny at the last moment. Danny could hear the tires screech as the driver got back into his own lane and sped off.

A drunk knew the signs when he saw another drunk driving under the influence. This guy was definitely drunk. Probably drinking in his car all morning and then falling asleep at the wheel after finally deciding to go home. Danny had done it himself on many occasions. Even though he could have stayed home and drank contentedly (and safely) in the comfort of his living room, he would choose to sit at the park on some mornings and drink in his car. He thought of how strange the ritual was, and how it was not unique to him. On any given morning, there would be a spattering of cars in each lot – all parked as far away from each other as the lot would allow. Each car with a single occupant, seemingly just sitting there. Every now and then, he could glance over and catch the sight of a bottle being raised to the driver’s lips.

Fred, another guy from one of the meetings, would occasionally go down to a local park and “work it.” He’d walk around the lots and catch drunks, pretending that he had just been walking by and was looking to make conversation. Sometimes, his presence was enough to make the drunk drive away. Sometimes, they’d stay and talk. Sometimes, they would even offer him a drink. Only twice, as far as Danny was aware of, did Fred actually get a drunk to open up about his problem and agree to take Fred’s advice. It might not have seemed like a lot, but that may have been two lives saved. Plus countless others, if you figured in the innocent lives that a drunk might take along with himself on the highway to Hell.

Danny began to hyperventilate. He ran the rest of the way across the street and sat on the curb, his gorge rising. He tried to calm himself, but could not. Eventually, he vomited into the gutter. It wasn’t the first time, but in the past, he’d always been drunk or hung over. He realized how pitiful he must have looked. He had never seemed to care in the past.

Eating was out of the question. Danny went back to the parking lot of his office, crossing the street with extra care this time, and got into his car. He drove straight to the church. He would be almost an hour and a half early, but that was okay. Someone was always there early to open up the rooms and make coffee. It was nice to show up and shoot the shit sometimes.

Not surprisingly, Mike was already there when Danny arrived. He was sitting out in the parking lot, but remained in his car. It looked like he was dozing. Danny walked over and rapped on the driver’s side window a few times. Mike startled, and he rolled the window down.

“Danny! You’re early. That’s great.”

“Yep. Couldn’t wait to get here, Mike,” he said sarcastically. “Tell you what. Let’s go around back and grab a bench.”

Danny led Mike behind the church. There was a small outdoor chapel of sorts – just a few benches facing a large, wooden cross, and overlooking a small stream. Danny motioned for Mike to take a seat, and then sat down next to him.

“Mike, let’s talk.” Danny seemed surprisingly calm. “I know that you’re pretty new to the program, and this may be skipping ahead quite a bit, but… let me explain how the fourth and fifth steps of AA go. They are, to me at least, probably the most important steps of all twelve. They are where you begin healing.”

“Sounds great, Dan.”

“Not really. I did a really shitty job on my fifth step. Remember how I told you that you’re only as sick as your secrets?”

Mike nodded, “Yeah, Danny.”

“The fourth and fifth steps ask you to make a searching and fearless moral inventory, and then admit to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.”

“I can see where that would help. I have so much guilt and remorse, Danny. Sometimes, I think it’s what makes me drink.”

Danny shook his head. “No, Mike, you drink because you’re an alcoholic. But it’s a whole lot easier to get sober when you get your head on straight. When you get rid of all of the shit that’s deep down inside. The stuff that regrets are made of.”

“So are we going to do that now?”

“Not we. Me.”

“I thought that you already did your steps.”

Danny nodded. “I did, Mike. I did. But the fourth and fifth steps are carried on throughout the rest. We have to continue to take a moral inventory, and do those steps over and over, because we are human. Just because we get sober doesn’t make us saints. We still make mistakes.”

Mike nodded slowly and remained quiet. It was as if he knew that Danny was about to say something important and it was time to keep his mouth shut.

“You see, Mike, there was something that I never admitted in my fifth step. Something that I couldn’t admit. The One Thing that I wasn’t ready to give up. I don’t know why, but it’s catching up to me now. I’m afraid that if I don’t let it go, I’m either going to drink or kill myself. Or both.”

“What is it, Danno?”

“This is probably a mistake. Telling a newcomer. Especially about The One Thing. In fact, this would be better left with a priest, but at this point it doesn’t matter because I’m going to have to own up to it. The One Thing is something that everyone will find out about sooner or later. Probably sooner, now.”

“You can tell me, Danny, your secret is safe with me.”

Suddenly, it was as if Mike had become the old-timer. His demeanor changed. He surely didn’t seem like a newbie anymore. The whole way he was acting… He had gone from being an annoying, overexcited, asshole to a quiet, comforting soul – at least in Danny’s heart. Danny took a deep breath.

“I’ve been sober for fifteen years, one month, one week, and four days. I told you that I came into the rooms about sixteen years ago, though. Well, something happened about six months into that. I’d been dry, sure, but still an alcoholic. Still exhibiting all of the same behavior. That’s what the program is for, by the way. Not to make us stop drinking, but to make us saner, healthier people. Well, Mike, I…” Danny’s breath hitched in his throat. He was already regretting bringing this up, but he felt like it was too late now.

“Go on, Danno. I’m listening.”

“It was late summer. Around seven o’clock, dusk. I was driving up Parkside Avenue, you know the place?”

“Yeah. As a matter of fact, I used to live in a cul-de-sac off Parkside.”

“Then you know the hill, about midways. Anyway, I was coming up over the crest of the hill, tooling along… pink clouding it, stone cold sober, mind you. A girl. A little girl, damn it. She came out from between two parked cars and just… just ran right out in front of me.”

“Oh, God Danny. No.”

“Yes. I couldn’t stop. I fucking ran her down, Mike. A little girl!”

“That’s horrible,” Mike grimaced, “But it was an accident Danny. You said so yourself. You were sober. She ran out from between the cars. You couldn’t have known.”

“No, but it was what I did next that was unforgiveable.”

“What, Dan?” Mike rocked back, laced his fingers together, and knitted his brow. He had a clearheaded look about him. One that Danny had never seen on Mike’s face before. “What was unforgiveable?”

Danny took a deep breath. “I didn’t stop. I just kept on driving. I panicked. It was like I had been drinking. I didn’t want to get caught. Afterward, I realized that it was an accident, but at the time… At the time, I just panicked. I acted just like a drunk would have. I left her there, Mike. Maybe she was still alive, but I left her there. What if she was just hurt and could have been saved if I had just stopped?!”

“She wasn’t hurt. She was dead the instant you hit her, Dan.”

“You couldn’t know that. I didn’t know that, and I was there.”

“I do know it, Danny. That’s what the EMT said. ‘Dead on impact.’”

Danny jerked his head up. It was as if his stomach had dropped out from under him. Like the first hill on a roller coaster. “What did you say?”

“When I got there, that’s what the EMT told me. Dead on impact. She didn’t suffer. She probably had no idea what had happened.”

“What the hell are you talking about Mike?”

“She was my daughter, Danny.”

Danny was speechless. He sat still for a moment, and then started shaking his head violently. “No! Fuck you, Mike. Her father is dead. I followed the story in the papers. He killed himself two months after the accident. Got drunk and drove into a bridge abutment. Why the hell would you even say something like that?”

Mike had tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. “Because now I know, Danny. Now I know that you are repentant.”

“Fuck you, Mike. How can you pull this shit on me? How can you even say something like that? Do you think that this is a joke? Well, fuck you.”

Danny stormed away, sobbing, and walked toward the church. Ralph had arrived and was walking in himself. He noticed how upset Danny was and stopped him, grabbing his shoulders and turning him around somewhat forcefully.

“Danny! What’s wrong? What’s going on?”

“That asshole. I told him, Ralph. I told him The One Thing, and do you know what he said?”

“Slow down, Danny,” said Ralph. “If you’re ready, why don’t you tell me what The One Thing is first.”

His secret no longer a secret, he told Ralph exactly what he had told Mike. “And he said that he’s her father! That dick!”

“Who, Danny? Who?”

“Mike. That idiot who’s been harassing me.”

“Where is he, Danny? Is he here? I’ll talk to him.”

Danny turned and pointed at the bench. “He’s right… He was sitting with me right there.”

Ralph cocked his head. “Danny, are you okay?”

“No, I’m upset, and with good reason. I just told him The One Thing, and he goes and says that?”

Ralph’s brow wrinkled with concern. “Danny, I’ve been here for twenty minutes waiting for you to go inside. I saw you sitting there on the bench talking to yourself, and thought that you were praying or needed some time to yourself. You were alone the whole time, Danny.”

Danny scanned the parking lot. No battered, green Honda. He started to breath heavily, and pulled out his phone. He scrolled through his call log – all of the calls he had made and received. All of the texts. Nothing. The only call in the last three days was the one he had made to Ralph that same morning. There was one text message waiting in his inbox. It had no number associated with it.

“I forgive you Danny.”

She caught me halfway up the stairs with the glass in my hand and threatened to tell my parents if she catches me again. 

I’m not sure what to do? I don’t want my parents finding out because they will make a huge fuss. I’m 20 and live alone but come home whenever I have days off work as I don’t live far.

So last Spring, my younger sister's alcoholism(9 years) finally got to me deeply. I was taking online classes to be with my family and help with my sister's 2 older daughters and newborn. During that time my sister relapsed hard. She drove drunk with them in the car, didn't wreck but had pulled over crying, a random stranger stooped and checked on her, took her and my niece's to her house, woman called my parents from sister's phone to tell them she has them safe!! Thank God for that woman. Then my sister became violent and beat on her fiance in front of my nieces and was arrested (again). She had to go to court for probation violation and jail time(previous DUI) Resulted in my nieces not being able to be alone with either of them which caused us to be primary caregivers. Then later my sister made accusations of me abusing her. First it seemed like sexual abuses accusations but later she said it was physical abuse. I never did any of those but I think it was my turn to be blamed for her alcoholism. She blamed my mother before. She then sent threats to kill me to protect our family from me, which is untrue. I always stood in the way when she tried to attack my mom and I received bruises and cuts from it. I was devastated, even writing this I am in tears. She really hurt me and it caused me to neglect my school. I should have dropped but I wasn't in a good mind. I talked to my advisor recently to apply for graduation (spring 2020 Yay!) and she was concerned about my bad semester. She asked what happened and I told her. She asked if I have documentation of these issues but I don't really have any besides police reports that only mention my sister. She then suggested I write the Dean of students and plead my case to remove the bad grades of that semester. 


My question:

Should I provide the police reports and conversations (texts) from my sister as documentation? I don't care if they don't accept my request but I figured I should try. Anyone have any suggestions? 


Ps: My sister is doing better and I am praying she continues to recover for my niece's sake.",1

2020-03-04 17:15:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fdktu8/i_was_sober_drank_again_then_it_almost_killed_me/,"I was sober, drank again, then it almost killed me.","Posting from this account, because I don't really use it.

About a year ago, I wrote about how I had stopped drinking after getting acute pancreatitis (i'm very young). I wrote about my detox experience in the hospital, and I received a lot of positive feedback about being sober, though it was only for two weeks post my hospital experience. I felt really good about myself for a long time....and then I didn't.

I don't know what happened, or why I fell into a downward spiral, but I picked up drinking again. I told myself it would just be one or two drinks, and then I would stop. But one or two so quickly became 5 or 6, and then 5 or 6 became every day again. I felt like I couldn't stop, and I was so ashamed to ask anyone for help because they knew how it difficult it had been the first time, and would never have thought I'd do it again. I never thought I'd end up in the same place again.

And then in two weeks after that, I was in the hospital. Diagnosis: severe acute pancreatitis.

And then kidney failure. And liver failure.

I was dying.

And I was detoxing yet again, while dying, and all I could think of was how stupid I had been. How I thought I could have control and limit myself, and now here I was, dying of pancreatitis and organ failure at 22, because I thought I was smarter than my addiction. I think a lot of people think that. That they're smarter. I know now that I can't be.

I don't remember a lot of it. I was in the hospital for 34 days, and all of it was on a double dose of dilaudid, which is 10x stronger than morphine. For 19 days I wasn't allowed to drink water or eat anything. I had shakes, I had nightmares when I could sleep, and hallucinations when I couldn't. My heart rate was so high from detoxing and organ failure that I was put in the cardiac ward, with someone checking in on me every so often to make sure I didn't croak.

At first, all my family visited me. Then slowly, they all stopped visiting until it was only my mom who would come during the day. She would sit and cry, leave, and come back the next day to do the same thing. I hated them for it at the time, but I understood much later that it was easier for them to accept I was dying when they didn't have to look me in the eyes.

Most of my experience was so hazy because of the pain meds. I felt worthless and empty, and just wanted it to be over with. Physically my body had given up on me, and mentally I had given up about 17 days in. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. It was like being stuck in a fog with no lighthouse in sight. I just wanted it all to end. To finally die and let the tiredness take over in a different way.

And then it happened. In some respect, I still have trouble understanding it. For a brief moment, the fog had lifted, and I heard a man's voice in my head telling me that I was going to be safe, and it was time for me to fall asleep. I knew what it meant, because the feeling I had, was like I was falling asleep, but I knew I wasn't going to sleep. It was borderline euphoric, and all I wanted to do was grab hold of that feeling and let it wash me away.

But then a nurse came in.

It was the end of her shift, she had said. She wanted to know how I was feeling. I told her. The voice I'd heard in my head, said it's okay to fall asleep now, and I was ready. She asked me if I felt afraid or scared. I said no. I didn't have an ounce of fear in my body. Though if I were to think about dying now, I'm terrified in all capacities. I wasn't then. I would later find out that she wouldn't have believed me if I was afraid. Guess it wasn't the first time she's heard something like it.

She sat beside my bed, and started telling my stories from her shift. Trying to get me to laugh. Played rock paper scissors. Showed me pictures of her dog on her phone. It took me a while to realize what she was even doing. She wasn't making sure I wasn't alone in my last moments, she was making sure I didn't fall asleep.

She stayed by my side for 8 hours past her shift, well into the morning. Did everything possible to keep me awake, rubbed my arms roughly or tickled my feet whenever my eyes got heavy. Specialists on-call finally started coming around in the morning, poking and prodding me, and the urge to fall asleep in that same way I had briefly felt had dissipated. Some level of fear had come back, and I didn't want to die anymore. I was terrified of it again.

For some reason, after that day, I began to improve. My pancreatic enzymes went down, my liver enzymes started cruising to a healthier level. My kidneys started functioning better. In the end, I left the hospital with half a pancreas. But I left with something else too. Some sort of new motivation to give back in life.

I finished college. I got a job. I started volunteering and giving back. I've never looked at things the same way since then. I feel calmer, and don't have mood swings like I used to. Occasionally, I feel the urge to drink, but it dissipates as time goes on, because I know that I can't fully control my addiction, but I can prevent it from controlling me.

I still don't know who that nurse was. Maybe she wasn't even real. Sometimes I think it was God giving me one last chance. But I think that without her, I would have died that night.

It took me a long time to even talk about this.

To admit that I felt I had not only failed myself in sobriety, but my friends and family too. I struggled for so long to tell myself that I was an addict. That this wasn't taboo. ""Its just college"" a lot of people said to me, ""It's normal to drink a lot"". But it's not normal, and its not just college. Young people can get addicted too. And it's so far from okay. It's so far from okay to normalize the behavior in young adults just because they are young.

It's been a year now. I haven't had a single sip of alcohol. And even as I type this, I feel like I'm questioning myself. If it'll actually help someone. But maybe it will, young or old. To know that they aren't alone, and that there are consequences for our actions. Maybe that there really is something out there for us, beyond life, that watches over us and helps us cross bridges that we don't think we can overcome. I crossed a barrier that I never thought I could get past, never thought I would ever be able to conquer.

I haven't looked back.

*To add a short blurb to everyone reading this:* if you need help, please get it. Trust me, I know how *hard* it is to seek it. But there are online platforms, phone calls, counselors, AA meetings, you name it. I made the mistake of never trying to get help, because, like many other people, I felt that I could deal with it myself, or often told myself it wasn't as bad as it actually was. Talk to someone. Anyone. It *helps*. It's one of the most difficult first steps to take towards getting sober, but it is so *so* not worth the pain, anxiety, depression and embarrassment that I felt trying to hide it.",143

I've found it very comforting to read everyone's posts and plan on being active here. This will probably be a bit long, so bear with me!

I'm an alcoholic. I have known this for awhile, but have never gone to AA or gotten professional help. I was always warned by my mother that I should just stay away from everything because addiction runs in the family. I'm a 28F and have been drinking since I was 16, at first weekly and eventually everyday in my early 20s. I would say I drink a couple times a week now, sometimes going a couple weeks without after I embarrass myself or fuck up. The first time I ever drank, I blacked out. I black out more often than not when drinking. I've always preferred liquor and its quite scary how much I can put down close to a 1k mL in a day/night sometimes more. It doesn't matter what it is. Whiskey, tequila, gin, vodka- I'll drink it in excess. There cannot be a bottle in my home because it will be gone within 24 hours. I will wake up with a hangover and start all over, slowly tapering my self the next day or 2 to avoid anxiety and feeling ill. The longest I have ever gone without drinking is 10 months on 2 separate occasions. I enjoyed my sobriety.  I accomplished a lot, looked amazing (all that water weight fell off), my mental health improved and my life was just better overall. That being said, I was pregnant during those time periods so I guess you could say I was forced into sobriety lol.

 Anyways, my drinking is definitely a problem. Once I get to a certain point while drunk, I become a different person. I say and do things I don't really mean or even think about while sober. I can be mean and sometimes have very dark thoughts about myself. I wake in the middle of the night after drinking heavily sometimes and have panic attacks and thoughts of how my family would be better off without me and not wanting to live. Just to be clear, I have never tried to end my life or purposefully hurt myself, but having those thoughts is still quite scary. I also sometimes hear things that aren't there at night while going through withdrawls/have trouble telling the difference between dreams and reality. In January, I went on a 4 day binger and gave myself a kidney infection. I didn't drink for 2 weeks, and it wasn't hard, but I ended up hanging with friends and started drinking again. I'm now at the point where I drink in secret once in awhile, even though my boyfriend openly drinks (he is the lucky kind of person who can have 1 or 2 and call it a night) as do most of my friends.

I haven't had a drink since Sunday. Before that  I was sober for a week and half, but gave in and had 3 drinks while out for crawfish on a double date. It was a good time and its those times that somehow convince me that maybe I don't need to abstain from alcohol completely. That Monday was the first time in a LONG time that I didn't wake up and take a shot to get rid of my hangover, even though I definitely had one. I want to be sober now though. At least for a long time. For myself and my children. So as I've seen said on here.. For today, I will not drink.",5

Sometimes I'll go on a heavy binge for 3 days to a week, going through up to a fifth of vodka a day.

I drink about once a month, usually with my fiance, who is 28. He gets buzzed, I usually get fairly drunk, and no matter how much or little I have, I end up vomiting. That part doesn't bother me much - I always make it to the bowl in time. 

Last night, I got a little high on prescription Ativan, and while my fiance was asleep, somehow I thought it to be a good idea to fill a water bottle with vodka - and chug it. Took me two tries to get it all down, but I did. Didn't do too poorly, outside of molesting my sleeping fiance a bit and some obvious vomiting.

I absolutely never even think about driving

But... I'm always like this when I'm around alcohol. I always drink too much. Is this something that I'll just learn to limit with time, or should I stop drinking completely?",1

I am 22 years old and I am genuinely worried I’m an alcoholic. I wouldn’t even say it’s a worry at this point as it’s more of me being in denial. I haven’t drank before work or school or anything and that’s mostly just because i work and go to class super early, but I definitely drink every single day. I go to both work and school extremely hungover no matter how early. I honestly don’t remember the last time I went through a day without drinking. I have a very bad anxiety problem and to cope I just drink. My usual “calm” nightly routine is having however many glasses of wine I need til I fall asleep and if i have a day off i will go out and drink so much liquor that i never ever remember what happened the next day. I go to school and I work, I’m trying so hard in school but every time I get overly stressed I just drink a shit ton to get over it. The past year for me has just been a blur, I don’t remember much because I was so drunk with friends or by myself. Drinking is truly the only time I feel calm and feel okay with everything around me. Like I said, I’ve begun to use it as a coping mechanism when I get stressed or if I feel upset. I need help very badly and I feel like it gets worse and worse everyday. At first I felt like it was impossible for me to be an alcoholic because I’m so young and I’m in college and I’m just having fun, but I’ve been through so much in the past year that I’ve just used drinking to cope with it all. Anytime I’m sober I feel such a weight of anxiety and I just don’t know how to deal with it. I’m so so scared to talk to my parents or anyone about it because I don’t want to disappoint them.

Turns out they work for a rehab center down south. Admitting you have a problem and reaching out for help is so, so fucking hard. This was a big step for me. Its a wonderful facility and the guy was so kind. We will work with you he said, your insurance will pay for it 100%, just come down here and we will pick you up, and you can bring your work so you won't get fired. 

So I broke it to my mom I needed help, she had no idea and I think she thinks i'm overreacting and being dramatic. I'm a functional alcoholic, I don't need to detox, I'm not in any legal trouble. It was so hard to do. I cried a lot. I was outed to my MIL as well because I needed childcare for those 30 days. I hated everyone knowing my business, but I needed to finally be real with myself. I felt a huge weight being lifted from my shoulders, I felt free and positive and sunny and hopeful, for the first time in a long time, I knew I could do it.

This morning I bought my plane ticket and then picked up my phone. There was a text from the guy I had been talking to from rehab. Turns out my insurance doesn't cover it. Any of it. I didn't even bother asking how much out of pocket would be. I was crushed. Instantly there was the 10,000lb weight on my chest again. He assured me he would find a place for me, one that would allow me to work. He ended up sending me a link to an app that I could download that has a list of places. I downloaded it and the categories are ""opiod addiction"" ""buprenorphine"" and ""detox"". That's not me, and I can't cold call more places and tell them how much of a loser I am, I just can't, I don't have it in me. I cried all afternoon. I told the guy thanks but I can't deal with that. He said he would help me after work. It's 10pm now. 

The person who I think should be supporting me the most said ""Well if you're going to ask me to be a single dad with our son for a month you should just buck up call people"" He thinks I'm weak.

She’s in a AA program but it doesn’t seem to really help her. This January she didn’t drink the whole month then she relapsed and ever since then she’s just been drinking very often. There would rarely be weeks where she would not drink. Now she’s at the point where she drinks and try’s to play it cool like she didn’t. And every time you call her out on it she does the same bs. She starts making up lies and talks bad on others (I guess to make her feel like she’s innocent) . And she never owns up to it anymore, shes been secretly drinking almost everyday now. What makes it even worse is that she takes anxiety medicine. So she gets really crazy. The stories and lies she says is ridicules.  

My biggest worries is that she will either lose everything in her life because of this, get her self killed, or someone else in my family injured/ killed. 
Every day she has to pick my sisters up from school and she drives drunk there often. No one can ever notice she drank so she gets away with it. But when your in the car with her you can definitely notice by the way she’s talking and beeping at cats that beep at her. If she keeps this up she will lose my sisters custody, her job, maybe even her husband (my step dad). everyone’s sick of it. Seems like she doesn’t want to quit no more.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I’m tired of dealing with all this, and the rehab place that I looked at in my area (Richmond, VA) is very expensive I could never afford it. Is there any free rehab centers in VA that you guys know of? Or if not what would you do in my situation.

2020-03-02 11:39:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fcer40/a_little_over_one_month_sober/,A little over one month sober...,"A “little” background:

I’m 31 years old now and since I was 16 I loved to drink.during my younger years me and my friends would turn every bight into a party and we had a shit ton of fun. Around the time I turned 22 the party was over, we had full time jobs, my long time girlfriend had moved onto “better”things and my drinking turned into nightly solo sessions of pounding booze, listening to music and passing out. I kept this up for years and I didn’t see much of a problem because I would still make it to work and handle all my shit. Around the age of 27 I was done living like that and constantly feeling like shit. I was so out of shape and alone. I met a girl (who I am still with) who was so caring and I thought to myself that out of all the shitty people/family in my life at least I have her. One person that absolutely cares and i figured I owed it to her to get sober.

I put down the bottle finally and started on a clueless path of sobriety. I didn’t get sick or anything so it was easy to stop. Me and my girl saved for a bitching apartment and everything seemed to be going good. After a little bit of time, I became obsessed with working out until my body was broken. I spent hours obsessing over hitting a workout goal to the point if would mentally destroy me if I didn’t reach it. I lost 120 pounds in less than a year and everyone thought I was on drugs because of the rapid weight loss. I didn’t care, I was winning life in my head not realizing I simply just traded one addiction for another and I wasn’t doing shit to fix myself mentally in the long run. I was temporarily happy getting outdoors to workout until I would miss a day of working out... then I was irritated, bitchy and depressed. To make matters worse for me, my girl who I loved so much did not want to participate in these activities for me, even getting her to go on a walk with me would turn into her bitching and complaining. I secretly started to hate her for that. Any who, I kept this routine up for 2 years. 

At 29, I found myself at a breaking point. I hit a wall with weight loss. I was 150 pounds and super skinny. I stopped losing weight and my only concern then was to stay at the weight I was. If i were to gain a pound my whole world would come apart and it felt like all my pushing to get to that point was a waste. Work was going through so many changes which was stressing me the fuck out. My relationship with my girl was in the dumps, no sex no nothing. The passion was gone. The daily routine was getting old fast and i began getting migraines from stress to the point I had to go to the hospital a couple of times because I thought something was wrong. I started noticing all these people that I knew who seemed to have their shit together all smoke weed on the daily. They get to do what they do and check out of their head at the end of the day and because I don’t like to smoke weed I because jealous over that. They seemed happy. 

So I decided to start rewarding myself once a week with a night of drinking with video games or music. A couple of hours to checkout mentally as long as I had a good week prior to that. That lasted for sometime and I actually was happier and more relaxed. I had something to look forward to at the end of the week which made life not so boring. My girl was not happy with my decision but I was over it... as far as I was concerned, she didn’t do shit to help out with my sobriety, didn’t want to join my activities with me, she didn’t want to start holding up more responsibilities (money wise) to make shit like rent a little more even with us instead of me stressing about money and her daily buying shit online because she had money to throw around... so she did not get to give me shit for drinking. Of course like I’m sure we all know drinking once a week was a temporary fix. Once a week turned into twice a week turned into nightly... AGAIN. The routine of work, drink, sleep and back to work had started back up and it was in full effect. 

I had to start sneaking booze at this point because I didn’t want my girl to see how much or how often I was doing this (even though she knew). I would stop off after work, buy a pint of booze, sneak it into the house in my lunch bag and wait for her to fall asleep. Once she was out I would lay there in the dark watching YouTube on my iPad and sipping until I fell asleep. Then the night drinking turned into day drinking on my days off. There was no hiding that... my girl would get off of work and I’m there at home trying to act sober making a fool of myself. She began to start hating me now but still I kept it up.

Then, my mother died unexpectedly and I decided not to hold back and let my addiction take full force in my head. The pints of booze turned into buying 750ml bottles out of fear of running out out of booze that night if I wanted to stay up and drink more than a pint. I was pounding bottles like crazy for a year and the tip of it ended with me quitting my job. I went on a three week long morning to night drinking bender. The last week of that bender I didn’t eat anything and got super sick. The booze was barely keeping me from puking but without it the sickness got a lot worse. I checked myself into a hospital and was given what I needed to kick the withdrawal. The first couple of days were the worst and I was taking benzos that were prescribed to me to bring down my anxiety. Once the kick was done I went out and got a new job. Now sober with a new job, I had to wait three weeks before I started due to some hiring policies. The first week was fine then I went out with my father one night I guess to celebrate and completely let loose which landed me in jail for a night after a fight I had with him. I was pissed at this point and started another week bender. Then I stopped again, went through the withdrawals... again just in time to start my new job. The new job was good and all but it was a night job which i never worked before. I went 4 days without sleep and gave in to a pint to make me pass out. Two weeks later I quite the new job and went ham again with booze. My girl left to her moms and I stayed alone in my apartment drinking for weeks. 

Shit got so bad, my girls mom reached out to me. She offered me a new positive place to live with her and her family. She wanted me surrounded by positive people and in a family environment... not living alone. I realized I never had anything like that and I wanted that in my life. I just had to get sober before I went. So this time, instead of completely putting down the bottle i tapered off with a couple of shots here and there for 4 days. It may the withdrawal for me a lot easier and I didn’t freak out much. After the 4 days I was still sweating and semi sick but I was able to move in sober and in a place to start a better path for myself. I started this past month of sobriety working on myself mentally. Not ignoring shit that triggers me but instead identifying the problems and correcting them to the best of my ability. Learning what makes me happy and what makes my life great. I now have someone to answer to which feels great. I feel like I have a parent. I’m not counting exact days sober because I don’t want to start obsessing over that like I did with my weight loss. I’m staying away from things that turn my brain off like video games because I want to think and hear my thoughts... which is huge for me because I’m usually running away from my thoughts. Best part is, this house is filled with tons of booze and I’m not tempted at all. Currently there are two things bugging me, a couple of young adults live here at the house and they like to party. Seeing them party has been the only temptation I have had because I want to be having as much fun as they are. But my way of drinking isn’t fun like that so after realizing that the temptation goes away. Second is my girl, she has become the biggest bitch towards me. Clearly she is not over my previous actions. Mind you, I have never hit her, or cheated on her, or have become an angry drunk she just had a family member who died years ago from drinking and hates booze with a passion so she took it very personally when I said fuck it and guzzled booze like i did. she took it like I didn’t care about her at all and I don’t blame her for that. She likes to remind me how much of a privilege it is for me to be here at her parents house, how I only have a little bit of time sober behind me and how bad I fucked up by “throwing my life away”... i stay quite and don’t say much back to her. Her attitude is so hard to deal with when I’m trying as hard as I can to fix myself mentally. I have informed her of this but she doesn’t care. She is stubborn with her feelings and i realize now that if this continues I’m going to have to break it off with her for my mental health and I’m okay with that. We have been together for awhile now but i cant go back to booze and I know if this isn’t fixed i cant move forward completely with my life. 

I start court ordered AA next week, which I’m okay with. Ive never attended meetings for myself (i have been but not for me) but what can it hurt?  Hopefully the meetings will be a great addition to my new path which I am headstrong to continue down. 

Long story, I know, but I felt like sharing! Keep up the good shit everyone!",2

A little about myself: Been drinking since college, I’m now 30. My situation is a little different from most. I don’t have the urge, I don’t drink during the week or drink alone. But if I’m at a social outing and any kinda alcohol is involved, 8 times outta 10, I’m going to get blackout drunk. This doesn’t happen often, maybe 4 times/yr but every time, I do something crazy. I can be violent when drunk, very rude, and lose all self control. I’ve got into plenty of bar fights, heated arguments with loved ones, and totally embarrassed my wife time and time again. 

This sucks because these moments have started to define me. Even if I drink with friends and we have a chill night, I am still treated like the guy to watch out for. My wife starts to get pissed at me while I’m drinking even if I haven’t even got drunk fully. People start to say things like “maybe you ought to slow down”. These things really piss me off when I’m not even drunk yet. 

I enjoy drinking socially and it seems like every social event I attend, everyone there is drinking. They are also drunk/tipsy but I’m the one that over does it every single time. What is my issue? Every time I wake up after a bad episode, I ask myself how did I let this happen again. Why did I have to have so many drinks? I was enjoying myself when I was buzzed. Why do we overdo it? Can I beat this without going completely sober or is that just my alcoholism talking?",2

A pint of fire ball and then vodka on top of that. I've asked him plenty of times to at least cut back. And everytime he tells me he will and does for a few days and then goes back to his normal amount and sometimes even more like last night. His excuse is is that its winter and he's bored. And that hes not working and stressing out about stuff. Anyways, hes sitting here telling me I'm I'm ng a child about how I'm upset about him and his drinking and that I shouldn't of made him sleep on the couch last night or gave him the cold shoulder this morning. Says I was giving him attitude the whole morning and I asked how because I wasn't even talking to him and he says yeah that's attitude. Anyways the day goes on we go out shopping and he asks if I'm going to hate him all day (has been asking me all day about it) and then tells me that I can't treat him like shit just because I don't like his drinking. I said not talking to you isnt treating you like shit. And then I ask him why he has to keep bringing the whole fight up if he wants to get over it. And he says I am over it I just don't understand why you have to be a child about it. I said so what.. me not talking to you because I wasn't ready to talk is me being a child? Me being upset about your drinking after you told me so many times you would work on it is me being a child? And then he says that I'm treatjng him like shit because I haven't hugged or kissed him today. I said so, I'm just not ready yet. (Still upset about the drinking) and he says yeah that's you treating me like shit. 
I'm just over it. We've been together for two years now. And he has a child and I have a child. I don't know what to do anymore.",3

Recently, he was living in a trap house with a couple of his friends and they would drink themselves silly and trash the place. His lease just ended and I offered to move into a place with him. He’s a goodhearted kid and I feel like if he’s around people that don’t party as much he might mellow out. 

We just finished moving in last night and it’s a nice place. He had a shot or two while moving in but other than that he was civil. But then around 11pm, my underage cousin (16M) and a couple of his friends stopped by and my brother handed them a case of Coronas and sent them on their way. I tried confronting him about it but he wasn’t interested in talking about it. 

This worries me greatly. I’m already scared for my brothers well-being but the fact that he’s now getting our younger cousin into drinking too is too much for me. And now that we’ve just moved into a new place, I can’t deal with this if he’s going to keep doing this to our cousin and himself. I don’t know what to do or how to approach this without him blowing me off like he usually does.",7

I recently got married to the love of my life and we have been in a relationship for more than 10 years. I always knew he likes to drink and he would drink 1 - 2 times in a week. Some months before our wedding, he reduced his drinking to drinking once in 2 weeks. I was extremely happy to see this change. But post our wedding, he's been drinking 3 - 4 times in a week!!! He has some reason or the other. Often the reason is that he is under a lot of work pressure (which is true) and due to that he often comes home late from work in a drunk state. When he brings home office work, he brings along an alcohol of his choice and drinks a few pegs while doing his office work. I have also noticed that whenever he meets his close friends, that meeting is never sober. He and his friends will definitely drink. He also drinks with me at home when he is cooking a non-vegetarian dish. I have seen that alcohol often does not have a good effect on him. After drinking, he becomes unexpectedly over-romantic, egoistic, hyper, does everything slow, gets easily ticked off and often repeats his talks. All this drives me nuts and these habits are beginning to hamper our relationship, his mood and behaviour. Everytime I have a conversation with him about this problem, he vows that he will soon quit it. Those vows don't seem to be getting fulfilled. FYI, we are currently going through financial difficulties and trying our best to overcome them but I am sure, alcohol is not the solution. I am confused about what I am dealing with and how to help him overcome this?",2

So, for those reasons, i completly cut alcohol out of my life, it was great because i didn't feel the need to drink. But last night, i wanted to go to the bar, drink only soft(non alcoholic beverages, that's how we call them in France) and maybe meet a girl, i wasnt tempted by alcohol

But i met a pub friend, i'm a sailor in the navy, and he is an officer, he's one of the reason i joined the navy. And when i told him that it was five weeks since my last drink, he ordered me a beer and told me to drink it.

I'm pretty weak when it's social pressure, so i drank, and then i drank again.

So, i had a five weeks streaks, it was great, i drank, didn't do anything bad, but i feel like shit, and lent jjst started.

She's almost 30, 90lbs soaking wet, is on trokendi for migraines, sometimes eats sometimes doesn't, and has a lot of depression and anxiety. She has been liquor-free for a year.

When she was 18, she could drink 1.5 Liters of vodka straight in one evening. Blackout drunkenness was the norm, from what she told me. She quit liquor a year ago after leaving a dude who was abusive when drunk. 

Last night she took a single shot of vodka, and experienced nothing short of euphoria. She was instantly drunk - I heard the change on the phone as we spoke. She described feeling like she's in the clouds, floating, and peaceful.

Tonight she took a shot while texting me about depression. The same euphoria came back. But she's also seeing rainbow everything when she closes her eyes, and has random childhood music in the background every time she closes her eyes.
