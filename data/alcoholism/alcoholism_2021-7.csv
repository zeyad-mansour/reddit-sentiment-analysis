He’ll just think we’re all ganging up on him and it’ll make things worse. 

Whenever he’s drunk, he is annoying at best, and scary at his worst. 


Tonight my parents got in another fight and that was basically due to him being way too drunk. 

My mom chucked the remote on the carpet floor in front of him out of frustration because he was drunkenly using the wrong one and pissing everyone off. He thought she threw it at him so right as she got up to go to the kitchen he threw the bigger (correct) remote right at her making her spill her glass of wine. 

As you can imagine things didn’t go well from there. 


Yes I know my mom wasn’t perfect in the way she handled this either. She doesn’t know what do because she’s talked to him about it before and it goes absolutely nowhere. He throws a fit when someone brings it up.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996482133865356}"

When I started to work remotely, my life changed, for the worse.  I started to drink more and more, as my boss no longer could see if I was fresh each morning I just couldn't resist the urge to make some Monday as Thursdays as another Friday... Drink a few and then go to sleep...

And it's getting worse and worse. Nowadays I drink several days a week. Even when hungover, I crave a few drinks, which never happened before. I think remote working has made me a true alcoholic and I must stop before it's too late. I just don't know how to do it. I don't want doctors to know it because my boss would also know it soon after. I hope I can quit drinking on my own but I don't know how. 

This sounds strange but not jerking off has been the only way for me to resist the urges to drink. And I have tried this a few times after reading about the dopamine-connection of drinking/drugs/fapping all being the same thing. Might just stop whacking off again because it seems to be the only thing to help me... Might be a placebo effect but if it works who cares.",3,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9748042821884155}"

They make us feel weak. They fill us with guilt and shame. We feel like we are never going to recover and we start asking ourselves, ""What's the point?""

I get it 100%...

My last relapse was really scary. It started in Iceland on a business trip and ended back home in New England with me drunkenly sobbing and saying to my ex that, ""hey. at least you'll have lots of life insurance money when I'm gone"" and talking about wanting to die over and over and over while my two year old son slept upstairs in his crib. 

That was almost four years ago and thank god that last one was my wake up call cause I was done battling my addiction and alcoholism and I was not going to let it win.

And that's what sobriety is; it's a war for our life. And wars can be one without winning every battle.

So what if we look as relapses as battles. You can lose a battle, but still win the war.

We want to keep the battles to a minimum, of course, and once you win one, at some point, you have to do the work to end the war.

But losing a battle does not mean you are weak or won't recover. It just means you lost that one, but **you can** win the next one and beat addiction once and for all.

So go easy on yourselves, friends. It's okay to struggle. Beat addiction up, not yourself.

Let me know your thoughts so we can discuss, collaborate and be sober together.

Much love & life,

2021-07-30 19:41:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ouwl5q/i_think_my_dad_has_become_an_alcoholic_and_i_dont/,I think my Dad has become an alcoholic and I don't know what to do,"I am really struggling with my dad's alcohol intake. He has always been the kind of guy who wouldn't say no to a beer or a glass of wine, for example after playing soccer with some old friends or so. Although when he still has to drive it has always stayed at said one glass only, he never drives drunk which I am very glad about. But lately it has become a problem.

I first realized something was odd when I went on holiday with him in 2019 and the two of us spent like 3 weeks together (which is very unusual for us because I moved out in 2015 and basically never spent such a long time with him after that). I noticed he would have a beer every single night. I brushed it off as a holiday thing and nothing to worry about.

I moved back home due to Covid in January this year and then I realized we are having a situation. He now gets (more or less) drunk every single day. Sometimes it's just 3 beers or so, but sometimes - even during the week - he will drink a whole bottle of wine and a few beers on top. On weekend days he sometimes drinks up to two bottles of wine and some beers in a single night. As you can see, he did not only increase the amount of drinking nights per week, he also dramatically increased the amount of alcohol he is drinking. When I was a kid, I never sam him drunk. Never. He would never have more than one drink. Now, as mentioned above, he is more or less drunk every single day.

We are going through a very tough time as a family; my grandmother has dementia and causes a lot of problems, my mother has some health problems, I have been diagnosed with an incurable condition this year that causes me a lot of symptoms and on top of that his job has turned super stressful and demanding due to a new boss. I know this is a lot of pressure on him and a lot of things to deal with, and I suspect all of this causes him to drink so much. It is his escape.

The problem is I don't know what to do about it. My mom, me, and even my sister (who moved out in 2012) tried to talk to him about it. He always acts like we are crazy for even suggesting he has a drinking problem. It doesn't help that I don't have the best relation to him. We have completely different personalities and he is very controlling which I, being 24 years old, absolutely can't stand. So whenever I try to talk to him it gets super awkward and I never manage to get close to him. He never talks about his feeling, his worries, never. Not even to my mom. He had a shitty childhood in some dodgy foster care home and I think this created some trauma for him. And something like therapy will absolutely not be possible. We live in a country where mental health still is being neglected and going to a therapist still means you are crazy for many people, especially in his generation. He wouldn't even think about going, not even in his wildest dreams.

So I am stuck. He doesn't want anyone to help him, and he doesn't realize he has a problem. Or maybe he does realize but doesn't want to admit it.

He also gets super weird and emotional about minor things when he is drunk. Last night he was super angry at me because I went to drop off a letter in the mailbox at 11:30pm?? I mean there is no logical reason to be mad about this, I am an adult, male, in a very safe area and the mailbox is like 3 minutes from our house. But he gets angry about these things for no reason when he drinks. One time he almost cried because I didn't lock my bike, which is hidden behind our garage in our backyard anyway. Another weird emotional drunk expression I guess. It's just so strange because him and me are not close at all and when he is drunk he comes up with all these weird things he would never care about sober. Maybe he wants to show some affection and can't do so when he is sober? He also told me he loves me once or twice when drunk which he never does usually. I was speechless in that moment because it was so uncalled for. Also I inherited his lack of expressing emotions so I didn't even manage to say I love you back to my own dad. I just couldn't.

Long story short, this man is almost 60 and gets drunk every night by himself and won't admit he has a problem. He is still high functioning, making a lot of money in a stressful job, and still takes care of the household, the yard, stuff like that. I just wonder how long he will be able to do so.

But the reason I am posting this message is because I'm very very deeply concerned for one of my siblings. I recently became aware that they have a moderate to severe case of alcoholism. It's been going on for years and I had no clue. I'm currently 23 and was away at college and they are 25. They were in an extremely toxic relationship for 7 years and I believe has been a factor in their case being so severe. They have also revealed to me, while heavily intoxicated, that they experience suicidal ideation and have attempted to end it at least 3 times, last being one year ago. I am absolutely devastated to know that the one person I love the most is experiencing this and I feel like I have to act fast or else I might lose them... really really soon. I know there's no one right answer and I have no control over someone else's life, but if anyone has knowledge on resources or steps to take in situations such as these, or honestly has personal experience with this and is open to talking, please reach out or comment or whatever.

I also had brain surgery twice this year and can't really defend myself anymore. Our teenager had to pull her off me the other day.

I also chipped a brand new front tooth (a week old), which really pissed me too off if I'm honest. If my kid is at risk instead of me, that obviously changes the calculation.

My mother in law had an issue with alcohol when she was alive and younger.

This is not an option.

Back on track, from my mother in law, I learned that you can't MAKE someone stop drinking, just make them WANT to stop drinking.

1) Help her not want to drink

I think he had enough of me mentioning how he’s having a drink every night and has now resorted to drinking in private when I’ve gone to the spare bedroom. 
I’ve just confronted him about it and he said he isn’t hiding it, he’s “storing” it. And then walked out to take the dog for a walk without saying a word. 
Don’t get me wrong I don’t mind him having one of two through the week but it’s every night and he seems to get quite ratty and in a rubbish mood while sober. It’s quite frankly taking a toll on the relationship I think",3,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983506202697754}"

I have also never been diagnosed with any mental health issues but I'm aware I have had some problems in the past few years, I even quit my successful job to move to a smallholding with my family for a new start, the booze came with me though ... I'm feeling better mentally now and just want to sort my physical health out and stop drinking. 

A big reason for this is that my uncle (who was an alcoholic) hung himself last week and we have found out he too was struggling with his mental health. He didn't have a wife or kids like me and we are finding out he was at a real low point. Its been a real blow to my family, my grandad and my Dad especially. He got medical help in the last month but when the police gave us some of his belongings there was a box of pills he had been prescribed, there was only a single tablet missing and we found it on the kitchen counter in his home. I'm sure he saw booze as medication as I always have, but I'm also sure it was making him ill and was in the end a major factor that ended him. I'm really sorry to get so deep in this post but I want people to know why I'm at this crossroads. 

My big question though is; what do you look forward to each day? I enjoy looking forward to drinking, I even for the most part enjoy the first few... But after 4, 5.... The fun stops, then after 10 I'm chasing something that I never find. But that initial ""want"" is what I crave, how do I replace that? What can I look forward to? I have family and hobbies but nothing ever seems to be comparable to booze, that buzz it gives me. I feel like if I can find a replacement I can get away from drink.

Due to their manipulating behaviour, blame games and more I'm struggling to unpick what was fair/healthy behaviour regarding his drinking vs him just being an asshole. 

Will specify now we did not technically live together but I was at his house 90% of the time due to covid.

His rules (that I can remember there we're more):
. He could have two bottles of cider or beer on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 

. No spirits in the house - seems fair enough.

. If I brought wine into the house (he said he was fine with me drinking around him) I had to either finish the whole bottle or take it home with me ASAP (which is not an ideal option when I was there a week at a time or more)

. He could drink wine with a meal out, or swap his Friday bottles for half my wine.

. He would message me when he felt like he was at risk of binging. Something he said his councillor reccomended. He didn't want me to do anything, just wanted to notify. 


Now I get there are multiple schools of thought on sobriety and some argue that you can learn how to drink in moderation again. However he would ALWAYS drink on his 'drinking' days (bought the bottles in each day from shop) and never just had the one bottle cause he didn't feel like two. If I wanted a beer or cider he'd always bring me back two bottles as well and if I didn't drink both I'd occasionally get a lecture about leaving alcohol around the house.

My typical drinking is a bottle of wine that will probably last me the whole weekend and maybe a  beer during after work on a couple of days. With his system I actually found myself drinking more often and more than I would at one time just to follow his rules. 

It felt like there was an onus on me and that if he had a slip (not something that happened during the relationship as far as I'm aware) it would be my fault. 

The notifying me of at risk feelings when I wasn't around just made me anxious. He didn't want support or company (which I'd  gladly offer only to be turned down). Is this a normal support tool? I'd always wonder what state I was going to find him the next day.

I offered to just never drink at his, or drink when out with him etc and that would not have been a problem for me. But he insisted he was fine with me having a drink at his as long as his rules were followed.

I'd just like to know what are reasonable accomdations for an alcoholic loved one vs his way goes.

For starters, I have been hitting the bars since I was 21…and it’s been pretty much consistently like that since and I am now 32 (F) as of April this year. Earlier this year, my relationship ended because my BF was a binge drinker who would get drunk every night at home. The relationship was toxic in many ways so I left. However, we had gotten back together for a short time and he calls me a “weekend alcoholic.” I know in general, alcoholics deflect onto others to avoid blame, however, he isn’t really wrong here. When I lived with him, I still went out here and there, drinks at dinner etc., but when I’m single it’s WAY more. We just split again and he said that if he knew I would be a “party girl” he would have left 4 years ago. He is just as guilty with drinking but this just..hit me hard I don’t know. I’m not at house parties with college kids or anything but I visit bars, friends houses, kayak with groups, camp etc where drinking is involved. Sometimes this also happens during weekdays. 

I am successful overall. I have a great job, great family and friends. I love my friends but I think they aren’t the best influence, specifically my best friend. She drinks more than I do. I have had no healthy romantic relationships in my life. I am single again. I am 32. Never been married. No children. 

I love this freedom I have but I also feel a huge weight on my shoulders. I feel judged. I feel like I missed the memo somehow. I feel a bit left behind? 

I want to stop drinking, I think? I enjoy the social aspect of it but often don’t even want to drink. I don’t always drink that much either. My ex would drink 2 six packs a night. I’m more of a drink on the weekends many drinks + shots that I typically do because they are bought for me.

I’ve also met a lot of people but those people I used to think “I always see them at the bars”…well that’s me now.  I think if I stopped though I would feel very lonely and probably lose some friends. I think I would really miss it actually. Yet, I dream about having stability, a relationship, a family someday but I know my time is slowly running out. I also think now who would want to be with me? No man in his 30s wants to date a woman who just wants to drink, and act younger than she is. I say I could quit but maybe I can’t, seeing as how I’ve said I’d quit 100x and haven’t. It’s a small Midwest town so I know I’m judged. My own ex said to me he doesn’t want to date me because I won’t settle down.

How do I break this pattern? I don’t know what steps to take. What is “acting my age” even mean for some one at 32?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9797559976577759}"

Idk. You guys decide. I’ve never really had trouble not drinking. I don’t crave it in the morning or anything like that, but when I do decide to get drunk I can’t stop until I actually blackout. It’s like my mind is telling me I’m too fucked up and to quit drinking but my body just craves more and more and I can’t stop. Normally when this happens it scares me straight for a bit cuz I can’t piece together the night before which is scary, and one time I even woke up in my own puke. But Sunday was officially the lowest I’ve ever been…

I met the girl of my dreams a couple months ago and we hit it off pretty much immediately. Since our first date we have basically been inseparable and I couldn’t have been happier. As things progressed and became more serious, we started to talk about introducing each other to our friend groups which is obviously a big step cuz you want your gfs friends to like you. Otherwise it makes things difficult.

Luckily for me, her friends are chill and cool af. The first time I met them was briefly for about 15 mins or so. We kind of ran into them in town so that’s why it was so short. Went ok. Didn’t say much since I’m kinda shy but whatever. Well this Sunday those friends were having a joint birthday party and me and my girl were going. I was nervous. I think anyone would be. Which led to me drinking more and more….

Well…one of the friends brought out an expensive bottle of bourbon he got from his birthday and gave me a swig. That was the end. Basically the last thing I remember. Everything else from here on out was told to me the following morning. Long story short I apparently drank most of his bottle and my girl was so embarrassed we had to leave since I was slurring my words and saying god knows what.

The whole way home I apparently called all of my girls friends cunts and said I hated them all. And I hated my girlfriend and she should go fuck herself etc. I guess she dropped me off at my house and somehow I walked to her house and was screaming outside her apt. I don’t remember the rest since I’m too ashamed to reread the text she sent but all I remember was waking up the next morning on my couch not knowing the time of day, what happened the night before, where my gf was. Nothing.


Soo. I lost the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with to booze, my stupidity, and me just being an overall asshole. Im too ashamed to even look at myself.Guess I do belong here now that I wrote all that out. Oh and best part!!!! I now am headed to go work my second job as a FUCKING BARTENDER 😑🔫

My partner(27M) and I(25F) have been together for about two and a half years and have lived together for the past year. I want to know how to support him better.

I met him a little after he had finished his recovery program because he was dealing with marihuana and alcohol abuse. He hasn't talked to me a lot about it but I have gathered his family was emotionally abusive. They are low-contact now.

During our relationship, we have both grown a lot as people and we have worked hard to learn to express our needs and our boundaries and be there for each other.

In the years we have been together his relationship with alcohol has fluctuated. He drinks socially on happy occasions and when we are out with friends, he also drinks alone when he is under stress. I do not know how it is to deal with drinking as I rarely do.

For the first few times he came home drunk I acted normally but soon got very frustrated with his inability to communicate and have a normal conversation. I have tried different approaches but I found I was the one being disappointed and frustrated and lately my approach is just to shut down and wait for the morning to come so we can go back to normal.

I understand this is not the best way to support my partner, but after some time it felt like this was the only way to avoid fighting.

Lately, his work has become more stressful and his relationship with his family tenser so he has been drinking more often. He used to drink about twice a month and now he drinks three times per week. He has this habit of going to a park and drinking alone that I don't understand. I have asked him calmly and in a nonjudging way about it but he has just said it's something he needs to do once in a while.

Sometimes it feels like it's a different person. He is a kind, curious and loving partner during the day and sometimes I come home to a person who drinks, doesn't take care of himself, and eats unhealthily.

For any people who will suggest cutting alcohol off completely, I am unsure whether or not that's a realistic solution. We live in a country in Europe where alcohol is very ingrained into our social lives/culture.

Thank you for reading this. I want to know if there are ways I can be there for him and correct my mistakes. If there is any more information I can add please let me know. Also, if there is a more equipped subreddit I could post this to I would be happy to do so.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9957872033119202}"

29 years old male here, I have a question about the possible damage I have done to myself because of my binge drinking.

During my college years I had a 'screw it' mentality and drank a lot. This was 95% of the time at parties, but I partied around twice a week, sometimes less, sometimes more. There were times I drank for days, but I often had some sober days in between or drank 'only' a few beers. After a few years, it crept in my life and suddenly it was normal to get wasted at every student party I was at. It felt okay, because my friends were doing it and it's college right? It was absolutely problematic drinking, since I was neglecting my responsibilities and well, being drunk so often is never good. I've been doing this for about 3,5 years, where the drinking slowly increased in intensity to where I was drunk twice a week on average I guess. I never drank during the day, which made me think that I didn't have a problem, whilst I DID have a problem.

I feel incredibly ashamed of my past drinking behavior and can't imagine how my mindset was like that and I've done things I would've never done sober. Before my drinking I was incredibly mindful about my health, but in the college mindset and fraternity I was in, this was (and is) seemingly the norm.

Life is incredibly precious and I wonder I've hurt myself permanently. Like the title of this post suggests: I'm constantly worried about the damage I've done to my body and that I'll die early and/or deteriorate early. Is it true the body can restore itself so the difference in a few decades will be negligible? Or am I doomed because of my drinking? I'm so worried and scared I won't be able to grow to my potential and/or get sick early.

I value my intelligence and I also worry that my cognitive functioning has been compromised because of this, that the damage of the binges was too much and my brain has been permanently damaged. Whenever I forget something, my brain immediately suggests this is because of my past drinking, whilst I'm not sure whether this is the case.

Some other information: I have been sober for quite awhile now (1,5 years) and physically I'm in shape because I work out a lot now and eat healthily. I don't think I've ever had withdrawal symptoms or any other physical problems, but it might be I'm overlooking something. I had a liver function blood test which came out fine awhile ago, but I understand there still can be damage to the liver, so I might want an ultrasound of the liver. I was on 150mg of Effexor/Venlafaxine because of OCD and anxiety all these years, but don't use it anymore.

How do you deal with this anxiety and can someone shine some light on what I've written?

Naturally, I open it up and check it out. What I discovered was a list of about 30 ways alcohol has made my mom’s life unmanageable, followed by a brief description of what god is for her. Both entries were dated about 4 months ago. It seems like something she was guided in writing. I also know she has a friend who has been in AA for a long time. She has mentioned going to AA meetings in the past. However, I know she is still drinking. She isn’t trying to hide the fact that she’s drinking, but she does try to hide how much she drinks. 

Anyway, I’m not sure how to process what I read or what I should do with it. I always thought my mom was completely in denial, but now I know that she is actually very aware of how her drinking negatively impacts all areas of her life. 

I don’t think I want to tell her that I saw the notebook. But is this an indication that she might be more receptive to a conversation about her drinking? In the past when I’ve tried to talk to her about it, she has gotten very defensive and dismissive. Should I try again? Would something else be more helpful in nudging her towards making a change? Im confident that if she continues drinking, it’s going to kill her one way or another.

*Edit: to clarify, I am NOT going to tell my mom I found and read that list. I haven’t bothered talking to her about her drinking in several years because of the negative response I always get. My question is asking whether or not she might be in a more receptive place for a conversation of that sort based on the fact that she has recently taken steps toward making change.

When I try to talk to him about it, he gets very defensive and says I’m being judgemental and that everyone around him drinks like that.

He has at least one beer or glass of wine everyday. If we go out for lunch or dinner, he’ll have 1-2 beers plus 1-2 cocktails. He has squash with friends once a week and then he goes drinking afterwards (2-3 drinks). He has one day a week where he works with his business partner and he has half a bottle of wine, sometimes the whole thing. Tuesdays are pub night and he’ll have about 2-3 drinks there. He always goes out Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, sometimes from noon to 4 am and there is always drinking, almost all day long.

We live with my father in law and he finishes 18 cans of beer every two days, so every other day he comes home with another 18 count but sometimes I've seen him come home with them every day. And he keeps some in his car when the weather permits because he likes to have a couple driving beers. One thing he does if he gets frustrated with the way things look is drink beer then clean. Usually he drinks enough to where he makes bad decisions about what he's cleaning. He's thrown stuff we love, that's obviously not trash, away and he even starts to forget what the place looked like when he started and he'll say it's worse than it was. This morning he went on a cleaning rampage. Last weekend was our daughters first birthday and right after that I got sick so for most of the week I was just taking it easy taking care of our daughter and slowly cleaning. Starting Thursday my fiance and daughter also got sick. We still cleaned anyways but we left her birthday photoshoot setup in the bay window and had some other things, like kitchen appliances, sitting out. Our daughter has her own gated off play area in the living room/dining room area. It's nice and out of the way and gives her the space she needs. While cleaning he decided it was a good idea to put the stand mixer, taken apart baby bullet, and rice cooker on the bookshelf in her section. He didn't put it on a high up shelf either. He instead took her books off of the shelf she could reach and grab them on, put them up on a higher shelf she couldn't reach, and put the stand mixer and everything on the shelf her books were originally on. I usually don't look at that shelf when I put her in her play area because it's in the back and there's no reason to unless I plan on reading her a book. I was about to go get her and put her in there when I stopped to talk to my fiance in the shower and he told me about it. I'm really happy I talked to him first or I wouldn't have noticed and she could have pulled the stuff off the shelf onto her head. When my father in law got home he got angry I took everything off the shelf. He said there wasn't room anywhere else for it even though there was, all I had to do was move and organize some stuff in the bottom cabinets. He told my fiance he would have to talk to him later and he stormed off to his room and slammed the door. This made my fiance mad and he followed him and they got into a yelling match in his father's room. He accused him of getting drunk and cleaning because he didn't make the smartest cleaning choices and my father in law got angry said don't you dare call me a drunk and said my fiance was gaslighting him trying to make him think he has a problem. They sorted out the argument but avoided talking about that part anymore. Though for some reason he still thinks the shelf she can reach is the best place for a heavy stand mixer and a blender that she can easily access the blades on. It made us realize that he really has no idea he has a problem with drinking and we're not sure if he'll ever realize it. We'd like him to eventually cut down because we want him to live long for our daughter. I mean he constantly refuses to go to the doctor so if the drinking ever started causing a problem in his body we might never know. He's a really nice person but when he drinks too much he can be stupid, unreasonable, and stubborn. I don't even remotely know how to deal with that part of him honestly. For the most part though there's never a problem, he's almost always happy and smiley but sometimes I guess he drinks a bit too much.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9878782629966736}"

(21F) I had my first sip of alcohol when I was very little, like 3 or 4. I always liked wine, especially port wine, a little too much. I remember breaking into my parents' liquor cabinet when I was 11 (my dad was working, and my mom had a brain tumor and was passed out) and spiking my and my brother's drinks with brandy. Up until I went to college, all my drinking was at home or at family events- I didn't party in high school. 

The worrisome behavior started when I went to college. I was resentful that I had been thought of as a boring square in middle/high school and wanted to go the opposite direction in college. I had social anxiety and low self-esteem from years of bullying and peer rejection, and suddenly I was thrown into a party culture that I wasn't the slightest bit equipped to deal with. I started drinking to take the edge off when I felt uncomfortable or frustrated in social situations. I didn't drink *frequently*, because I didn't get invited to that many parties, but when I did, I would binge. My first blackout was at the end of my first semester- I drank a wine glass worth of hard liquor and ended up screaming hysterically about my mom, who had passed away. I blacked out again my second semester and almost went home with a guy I'd just met, one day after cluelessly letting another strange man into my room while (you guessed it) drunk. I had several more alcohol-fueled breakdowns (not blackouts) that semester as my untreated mental illnesses wreaked havoc on my life. There was an incident in which my ""friends"" accused me of doing something awful I had no memory of, and they used my prior track record to convince me that I had ""blacked out"" even though I had literally 1.5 shots that night. After losing that group I had even fewer opportunities to drink, but as before, when I *did* have access to alcohol I would binge and end up saying/doing things I regretted.

Then the pandemic came. I drank at home just like I used to when I was younger, but only when my dad brought alcohol into the house, because I was still underage. I turned 21 last December, and have bought alcohol on maybe 6 occassions since then. I assumed that, because I wasn't drinking a lot even though I could buy alcohol whenever I wanted now, I didn't have a drinking problem. But then events started happening again. 

I got drunk at my cousin's baby shower, and two weeks later, *blacked out* (after 2.5 years of not blacking out) at an election day party for the campaign I'd been working on. In my typical blacked-out fashion, I started crying about my dead loved ones, and still have no idea how I got home that night. I haven't talked to anyone from the campaign since. Two weeks ago was my cousin's wedding, and I did well at first (realized I was drunk at the reception and had a ton of water to sober up), but then started drinking again and got so drunk that my aunt had to take care of me. Since then she thinks I'm an alcoholic, and my dad is very concerned. I'm supposed to be ""drying out"" for a month following that last incident, and haven't had any alcohol since.

Basically, I can easily go days, weeks, even months without having a sip of alcohol, even knowing that I can go out and buy it whenever I want. The issue is, when I'm at an event where alcohol is being served, I have no self-control and end up binge drinking. I don't want to have to stop drinking, especially at such a young age, but I want to be able to go to events with alcohol and not go overboard. What do you guys think?

My therapist is overbooked and can't get me in, I have an appointment to change my meds next week but that seems so far away. My chest hurts everytime I have a drink but I can't even care, if I'm going to die from this today or tomorrow, I just don't care.

I don't want to be the reason he cries like that but I also feel like I'm at the end of my rope and can't make the changes I'd need to get better. I feel like I'm disappointing everyone. My sister and I used to talk for hours everyday and now she barely texts me back. My therapist has suggested inpatient for my mental health/addiction but it's so expensive and I'm not actively suicidal so there's not even a guarantee I could get in, and even if I did, then my mom would be even more upset and disappointed in me because she doesn't believe in mental health stuff and doesn't like me going into debt for stuff like that.

The bpd means I’m very impulsive so I started drinking ‘dangerously’ from quite a young age.

Anyway now I feel like it might have gone a bit far. My tolerance is incredibly high and i can’t function or cope without drinking every day. 

Luckily I live at home so my family stop me from drinking before a certain time.

Now I know that I can stop. I’ve had to stop before and I did it it’s just that I don’t want to.

I’ve just started dbt for my personality disorder and I don’t know if I should tell her about the drinking. If I do I have to write down every drink I have in a day and in all honesty I don’t think it will fit in the box to write it in which I’m finding somewhat embarrassing. 

I want to be able to go out every now and again and have a few drinks. I don’t think fully stopping is right for me but I don’t know maybe I do need to stay sober for good. 

I’m at a point where I’m panicking if I have to go somewhere that doesn’t a we’ve alcohol. I struggle to socialise without a drink but embarrass my self when I do drink. 

So I’m not sure if I should tell my therapist. I’m wondering if the therapy would help with drinking too. It’s behavioural based (so things like stopping self harm, eating disorders, suicide attempts etc) but I guess that could extend to stopping or moderating drinking. 

My other concern is that if I stop I will lost likely switch to another behaviour of mine. But the therapy is meant to give you healthy coping skills to replace them with so maybe I need to wait till I have those in place first. 

Sorry for such a long post. I’m just very unsure what I should do. Drinking for me isn’t glamorous. I also want a job in healthcare which I won’t be able to do if I keep going so I guess sobriety is what I need. But I do think this therapy will help with it so maybe I do just need to tell her",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980175495147705}"

I can also stop when I want to. Its always between 2-4 max. On the weekends, I tend to drink more heavily in the evenings to relax with my partner. I don’t have a physical dependence to alcohol, but I know that I could stand to cut back just for overall well-being. I never drink to the point of blacking out or passing out cold, and I’ve never gotten in trouble for driving drunk or anything like that.

It was very simple and went like this:

""***Why do we choose that which does not choose us.***""

It made me stop and think about how I use to choose alcohol all of the time as my go to to deal with feelings and emotions I could not handle.

I used to beat myself up about the fact I was so ""weak"" and why no one in my family understood or wanted to talk about it and then I finally understood.

Even though I chose alcohol...*I did not choose to be an alcoholic.*

That's all I needed to know in order to love and have grace for myself in order take the first steps in recovery and healing.

2021-07-23 11:08:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/oq4cdr/struggling/,Struggling,"Ever since I had my first drink when I was 19, I have had an almost uncontrollable craving for alcohol. I don’t know how I only rarely gave in to the urge and binge drank, but I’ve come very close to doing it very often. It’s an emotional thing—if I’m feeling upset, all I can think about is drinking. And it’s not just thinking about social drinking, it’s about getting utterly drunk to the point where I just fall asleep.

I went to a party with some friends right around the time I started drinking. They brought alcohol (vodka) with them, and I kept asking to drink it. When I got drunk, they started to say I couldn’t have any more so I tried to “act sober” so they’d give me more.

I recently turned 21 and went to a liquor store. I ended up buying 2 packs of drinks because I wanted to have the security of knowing I had a fair amount of alcohol in my apartment. Then I bought beer. Then I wanted to go and buy liquor so that I could drink less but still get drunk. I didn’t buy the liquor, but I spent about an hour googling liquor stores near me and crying about wanting to get drunk without drinking a lot.

The other night, I got overwhelmed about something and it took everything in me to not just down a ton of drinks. It’s all I could think about for 3 hours. And this was in the middle of the night. I got rid of all the alcohol I had in my apartment, I dumped it down the sink, but I had to put a mask on when I did so I couldn’t smell it. When I did take the mask off, I could still smell it, and just froze. It was awful.

Finally, I struggled with not going and drinking in the morning. I knew this wasn’t healthy and didn’t give in, but boy did I want to. Even though I haven’t drank in excess (for the most part), I feel like I’m an alcoholic because of how badly I am emotionally and mentally attached to it. I’m still struggling, and it’s 11 in the morning.

I’m sorry this is so all over the place, I just needed to get it out and see if anybody wanted to share any similar experiences. I’m doing everything I can to be sober. Thank you to anyone who reads this.",18,{'mask': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982580542564392}"

-  Depressed. Anxious. Hits “overload” much, much sooner than other people. 

-  Sleep issues. 

-  Drinks daily. Drinks to the point of passing out. If he isn’t working that day, he will start drinking soon after waking up. He is clearly self medicating. 

- Very little concern for his own health, hygiene or appearance. No concern for the cleanliness of his bedroom. 

-  No interest in getting better. He sees a therapist, but isn’t truthful about the depth of his issues. He’s seen a psychiatrist, but once again isn’t up-front about his struggles. Won’t take medication.

He's been struggling with alcoholism for a long time, years before I knew him. He's been to rehab and gone through treatments etc which he said has helped him. He was pretty bad at the start of 2020, around when I met him. 

But he's got so much better recently. End of 2020 he was hardly drinking.

But then he started working again. He's become very depressed and lost. He says he doesn't enjoy his career choice anymore but it's all he's studied for all his life. 
I'm trying to help him find other options. 

Last night was the first time he was drunk because he was depressed in so long. It worried me so much. He gets very agitated and angry when he's drunk. He doesn't get aggressive. 

He called me because he was very down. I told him to go home because where he works is filled with alcohol. He wasn't going to open that day, so I said just get a taxi or bus and go home. 
He had a glass or two of wine at work and then went home. Normally he's distracted at home and tends to not drink. He got extremely drunk. I called him when I got back from work and I could hardly hold a conversation with him. He lives with his family right now.

I have a bit of anxiety around drunk people while I'm sober because my dad suffered with alcoholism when I was young (he's over that now) and he would become very aggressive and nasty. I was never abused by my father but he would scare me. My bf doesn't scare me at all, I just get a bit of anxiety about it. 

He's in the process of getting professional help but everyone knows how that goes. It's been a really draining and long process for him. I just want him to find someone asap. 

I was just wondering what I can do? Is there anything I can do to support him? I don't really know what to do when I'm around him like that. I just go quiet and inside myself. 

My only experience with alcoholism is my mum with my dad. Where she would have to hide or throw away all alcohol in the house. 

I think now I realise how much my dad did affect me when I was younger. And it's the last thing I want to put on myself and my children in the future. I can also see how much he's suffering.

She has had 2 DUI arrests and convictions. After two years of not drinking due to breathalyzer monitoring 3 times per day she is drinking again. And hiding it. Well, trying to.

Some history: up until a little over 6 years ago when she had gastric bypass surgery she was unaffected by alcohol. She also has a lot of mental health issues (depression, stress, insomnia, bipolar). Her partner before me was a heavy drinker and started her down this road.

I have asked and begged her to stop. The only thing that got her to stop was the impending court date for that second DUI and then the two year probation. She says she goes to online meetings, which are anytime, and that she's not drinking. But I see her acting like she has been. I find her nip of choice hidden around the house and her truck. She seems to think i will believe that they are just magically appearing because she has no idea what I'm talking about. 

I probably need to just leave since her drinking results in fights and screaming matches and its just not healthy. But I'm only working part time and even at full time really wouldn't make enough to live on my own. (No degree, can't get a job paying more than teens per hour, plus my car is 600/mth). 

I just don't know what to do or how to help her.

I tried explaining to her tonight how much the drinking affects me and she refused to listen or discuss it. And her reaction told me she doesn't want to hear it or think about it because she really does know.

I'm just completely at a loss.... and just need to vent some to people who will understand.

Thanks

[[Side note, since her arrest for the second DUI in may of 2018 i have not had any alcohol, barring a possible sip of something she had alcohol in trying to investigate]]",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976317882537842}"

For the most part I seem to have my life in order, the drinking does sometimes negatively impact it but nothing so much so I felt like it has complete control of me. 

I can still go out and do things and stay sober for important things/work etc, ive never felt like alcohol is needed for me to be able to enjoy something, although it can help, kinda like bacon on a burger.

The drinking started mostly because of stressers and a shit year, my ex cheated on me and I found my own place, but the place I live at has a really shit landlord, 100% slumlord, but ive got a dog and finding a pet friendly place that wont cost me my entire months earnings on rent alone. So ive kinda sucked it up. Ive been looking for another place but right now its at an all time low. 

also my car started leaking oil and I dont have the money to fix it, it doesnt seem like a massive problem yet but should be dealt with somewhat soon. 

I know alcohol is not the right answer and should find a better coping mechanism but I really just sometimes want to be put into mindset where I dont really stress about life.

It sounds hella depressing but sometimes the only thing that makes me happy is knowing I can have some beers later.

For the better part of 20 years, I have been a 12 pack every other day type of person just to keep myself ""even"". Though last year it became worse and was more towards 2 out of 3 days, and the amount was probably 12-15 rather than a standard 12 every time.

Last month I had hip surgery and wanted to enter the situation in a good state of mind. I quit drinking 1 week prior. I had seemingly no withdrawal issues outside a little anxiety the 1st few days but that could have been other factors as well. I stayed sober for 1 week post surgery... then fell back to my familiar foe. I had around 15 beers on day 13 and have been having the hardest time of my life since. Started with bad headaches, like go-to the ER bad, which is a place I've never been. Then after a few days I'd have drinks and they would go away. Then had have drinks again and they would reappear, seemingly shorter intervals each time. Now headaches are accompanied with severe depression and foggy mind, hopelessness etc. Last week dark thoughts began to take over, so I'd rinse and repeat, with symptoms coming back even quicker each time. This has been going on for a month now

My biggest question is, is it possible to not have withdrawal, begin drinking again, then suddenly go through it in such a quick time period? Would it be ""kindling"" perhaps, or am I letting my mind get stuck/worry and that's causing other complications.

I'm trying to ease my mind, if it's withdrawal that appeared suddenly, then I will do what it takes to get through it. I started an antidepressant 2 days ago, which is surely adding to the worry, anxiety and insomnia, but I was terrified of where my mind went. I'll do anything for piece of mind, as I fear I'm losing mine. It has already cost me a relationship during this short time and is destroying my day to day life.

I am so happy and relieved rn. I finally got my ruling on my VA disability. Lower than I hoped for but still helpful. But the check for retroactive is enough for me to move and a cushion until I get a job!! Without having to borrow!!

I have been so stressed and anxious about this. But I kept telling myself as long as I continued moving forward and doing the next thing in front of me, the future would work itself out.

And it did!! 😍

But there's more. 

3 years ago I rented a room for maybe 5 months, from someone I found on the internet. Really great person with awesome dogs. After I moved out we didn't really stay in touch. Just life.

Today I got a message from him saying that he saw my FB post and that he still owed me my security deposit. That he'd been broke but had never forgotten and was finally able to do it. 😮 *I* didn't even realize he owed me anything, actually asked if he was sure lol.

Or I worry that I’ll get arrested for public drunkenness or something else dumb I do when I’m that drunk. That would ruin me- my career I think would be over. Or maybe I don’t get arrested but I say something f’ed up to someone I care about and ruin an important relationship.

Being able to go a day or a week or a month sounded impossible, but I knew it was something I wanted.

And that was enough when I first began.

But the anxiety and restlessness did not go away and I began to understand something else had to shift if I really wanted to be sober. 

Truly sober...

And so I started thinking about how I could become sober in mind, body and spirit. To be free of ALL of the things that made me drink in the first place whether physical, emotional, mental or spiritual.

And as hard as it was I began to get to know my fears, my resentments, my grief, my sadness, my trauma (both self-induced, not self induced and ancestral).

It was really hard work. It was scary. It  was lonely. But it was and still is so worth it (because the work never really stops)

Back in the day a bad day at work would make me drink. Now I've been through some things I never thought imaginable to get to where I am at and I have never had the desire to drink or go back to that way of coping.

I really believe in sobriety of mind, body and spirit.

What do you all think? 

Is this something you have experienced?

I’ve struggled with many other substances before but have been able to kick most of them without outside help. Though, I can’t seem to find the motivation nor strength to stop drinking. I understand that going to a clinic is the best way forward. I can’t take that option though. I understand it’s the safest and most reliable way forward but for many reasons I cannot take that approach. Drinking for me is now out of survival not a wanting to forget. I want this to end, I just don’t know how to approach getting off this. I’ve tried AA/NA and Smart Recovery but now can’t go to in-person meetings and the online ones just don’t work for me personally. 
Please, I know the answer to this is to find a way to make rehab work. This is not an option I will take, I have been there before and last time faced many different types of abuse. I’ve taken legal action but my trauma surrounding this is currently making rehab impossible for me. With all this out of the way, I need help. I can’t detox in a clinic, and I don’t know the way forward. To be honest, I’m terrified. If any of you have advice on limiting/stopping drinking safely I’d be in your debt. I don’t understand why I was able to get off my other substances and not alcohol, I just know that it will kill me if I don’t do something now.

Like to stop smoking, smoke 5 cigarettes in a row and telling yourself you don’t like it as you feel the overload effects of doing it.

I should have been sober a whole lot sooner.,"I'm on Day 9 and it's going good so far. I was watching one of the videos of the YouTube channel ""Getting Sober...Again"", episode #98. It was about Self-Sabotage vs. Sobriety. My mom was listening to the video from her bedroom while I was watching it on my Nintendo Switch in the living room. It made me think for a couple of hours. I'm still trying to figure out why I wasted my life self-sabotaging myself with alcohol until this year.

What I've learned about alcoholism is that it can be a genetic makeup. My late father use to drink and smoke every day as a truck driver until the summer of 1994 when he had 6 months to live as he was dying from lung cancer and liver failure. My mother's father, my grandfather who died 3 years before I was born, use to drink and smoked a lot, too. My mother was a heavy smoker from her teenage years until 2005 when she quit cold turkey. She drunk a lot of alcohol too, but had quit around the same time as she quit smoking.

I know that I gotta do more to forgive myself and love my body again. We all have regrets about what we would have done to make things better for our bodies. As for me, I have a couple of regrets. I should have been sober a whole lot sooner. The reason why I was living as a functioning alcoholic was to numb my pain without any help. In 2007, I've activated my alcoholism gene just out of interest. 14 years later on July 10th, I smashed the last bottle vowing not to drink ever again...and admitting to my mother that I had an addiction, no matter how many times she warned me about alcoholism. I should have listened to her the first, second, and third time. But, I guess it's better late than never sometimes.

I started drinking when I was 16 although it was rare. A few times a year I snuck out of my dad's house to party with my friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of high school and my drinking increased. Drinking alcohol contributed to my dropping out however a few years prior I was diagnosed with GAD \[generalized anxiety disorder\]. I had been on several meds for it but nothing worked. Alcohol gave me the confidence to be around people and initiate conversations. My father was an alcoholic and I'd often take his beers out of the fridge after he passed out at the kitchen table or in his room. Drinking was now a weekly sometimes every other week thing. 

&#x200B;

Several times a week my father would visit with his friend who lived a couple miles away. He was an old family friend. I began going with my father to his house and we all drank together until the early morning hours. I think by me drinking with my father gave him peace of mind opposed to me sneaking out and getting wasted somewhere else. At least he knew where I was and how much alcohol I was drinking, he could monitor me.  This went on until my father's friend died a couple years later. I was 19 now and bribed my older friends to buy me beer. From 19 until 21 I was bribing friends to buy me booze and they would.

&#x200B;

From when I was 21 until 23 I drank mostly once a week, rarely twice. At 23 I moved out of my fathers house into an apartment of my own where I currently live. Conveniently theres 3 liqueur stores less then a mile around me. This worked well because before I lived in the country it was more difficult for me to get booze but now I'm in the city theres stores everywhere. I could now get booze whenever I wanted by either walking or taking a cab, my sister also lives nearby and from time to time gives me rides to the store. My drinking increased. I was now drinking every 4-5 days, buying 18 packs. 

&#x200B;

I'd spend my hangover days laying in bed all day recovering. Fast forward to when I was 27 my upper right side began to hurt, throbbing. I didn't doubt it was probably my liver but I didn't care. I started packing on weight. I weighed 160lbs when I was 25 but now I was 190lbs at 28, bloated, red faced, depressed and didn't care if I lived or died. This mindset continued until I was 29. I was now drinking every 3 days anywhere from 20-25 beers each time. The pain on my side increased to now my upper back and the pain was now daily. My weight increased to 200lbs. I drank to get wasted, nothing short of it. 

&#x200B;

The last time I drank alcohol was last Monday, I bought a 30 pack of beer and started drinking at 8PM and was still drinking at 8AM the next day and didn't even catch a buzz so I kept drinking faster hoping to catch what I was seeking, a buzz, drunkenness, something, anything. Around 9AM I looked in the fridge and was out of beer, I knew then this was not normal nor healthy. It clicked in my head drinking that much should have done the trick but nope, nothing. I knew I had to quit. 

&#x200B;

The next thing I was concerned about was the withdrawals. It's been 7 full days and no withdrawals, no dts, shaking, seizures, anxiety or sweating. The thought of drinking a beer did pop in my head once or twice but thats it. The pain on my upper right side and back has just about faded away. I'm not bloated anymore and have felt like I have lost a little weight. I feel lucky I didn't go through bad withdrawals as others have.",11,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9276105761528015}"

I regularly blackout and forget things from the night the next morning. 

Ironically drinking makes me less social and makes it harder for me to talk to people. I become more introspective and negative the opposite of what I want but I think it helps numb the social anxiety. Like I start having a hard time where it feels like I'mbeing slowed down.

I don't have any alcoholics in my family but I was told that if I failed to limit my drinking on my next outing that would be good evidence you need something to change.

I don't drink at home, I have zero desire to drink at home only when I'm out socializing at night downtown do I binge.

My issue is that it's hard for me to understand if I really do have a problem, but then I feel like I shouldn't label myself like that because there's other people who are struggling with it so much more heavily; and I don't want to have to get sober completely, it's just that I know I need to quit the solo/morning drinking.

For context, I am an only child and my parents have been divorced since I was 6 months old.

My dad, a successful CPA, died last week at the age of 64. I  knew the drinking was a problem but I was in denial about how bad it really was. Both sides of my family have a history of alcohol abuse which has always been disguised as ""social"" or ""cultural"" but as I get older (I just turned 32) I am starting to see that its really a form of suicide.

The past two weeks have been terrible. My dad had a heart attack while my boyfriend and I were on vacation. I went home to meet him at the hospital. The first day in the hospital he sounded great, normal, conversational. He told he didn't have a heart attack and it was no big deal. The next day is really when everything fell apart. For two weeks I watched him go through alcohol withdrawals. With the exception of a few literal angels, most of the doctors and nurses scoffed him off. ""Oh this is *just* what happens when you drink so much."" He was no longer ""my dad the successful CPA"" but in the eyes of the medical providers he was ""just another alcoholic that probably would die before he stopped drinking.""

During this time, I had my own LaLaLand fantasies. This was just his first bad experience, he would probably see the light and sober up after this. He quit smoking cigarettes' cold turkey, he could probably quit drinking. He was a prideful man that *cared* what others thought about him, now that he was so vulnerable, so undignified, surely this was the wake up call he needed to right his path.

The doctors would never be straight with me about the prognosis. The goal posts would move on a daily basis. First, we can't treat the heart attack because the DT's are too bad he won't sit still, he is too agitated, we need him still. Then it turned into, we can't treat the heart attack because the alcohol withdrawals have him too lethargic, we need him to have energy to move. I over heard multiple hushed conversations where the medical providers discussed this being one of the worst DT events they've ever treated. 

My birthday was over the 4th of July weekend and I needed to get back to work. I saw my father on my birthday and told him that I would have to go to work Monday-Friday (in another state) but that I would see him by Saturday. The doctors told me he would probably be discharged before I returned. I didn't know how that was possible. The man was virtually a vegetable. He could barely speak, he couldnt lift his arms, he couldnt lift his head. I knew *he* was still in there though because he could usually muster a few grunts in response to yes or no questions. I didn't know how the doctors could see his release within 5 days. The last thing my father ever said to me was a whispered sing-song, ""Happy Birthday to You"".

The day before my return they called me to tell me he passed away in the middle of the night from a 2nd heart attack.

The past 10 years I've chalked my dad's alcoholism up to a general disinterest in me. I frequently thought, he wont come visit me because I'm not important in his life. He won't call me because he's got better things to do. He won't help me because he would rather help someone else. I was in denial about how bad the alcohol had taken over every aspect of his life. Growing up he was athletic, ambitious, healthy. I knew he had a past cardiac incident, so I assumed his life style change was because he was afraid if he pushed himself he would have a heart problem. But  I see now, the cardiac incident was just a catalyst for him to descend into the bottle.

Nobody knew the drinking was this bad. Now all his colleague are asking about when the services are, why there hasnt been a funeral announcement yet, etc. But the fact is, despite being a successful CPA in one of the richest parts of the world with multi-millionaire clients... he has nothing. There is no money, no insurance, no retirement, nothing except credit card debt. I've had to tell some people that I simply don't know if there is any money for a memorial service. I feel like I was robbed of my father. Someone/something took him from me, slowly, over the course of the last 10 years and I didn't fight hard enough to keep him with me.",103,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9963751435279846}"

It’s been an ongoing problem since he’s been a young adult and has only gotten worse with age. My family has been affected from it constantly. He used to pick me and my cousins up from school when we were younger and he would always be late or stumble in reeking of pure alcohol. It was always so embarrassing and it didn’t make things better that we are Russian and the whole “Russians are big alcoholics” stereotype was a pretty popular thing back then. The sad part is that my grandfather was worse than the stereotype. I’ve seen him wake up and take his medication with a bottle of vodka. I’ve seen him get absolutely plastered by 11am. He’s said some awful things while drunk and done some even worse things. He wasn’t physically abusive, typically he’s pretty passive and just runs his mouth, but there have been times where he has gotten physical with me, my mother and my step grandmother. He’s been hospitalized multiple times from being found passed out on the street in broad daylight. The tenants in the building my family lives in have taken to coming to my aunts apartment and knocking on the door to let her know that his is drunk.

In present day, my boyfriend and I have moved in with him temporarily while we save up to buy our own place as well as to help my grandfather around the house. He has multiple medical conditions and while he is capable of doing many things on his own while sober, he is not capable of doing things on his own while drunk. He has managed to explode a microwave and almost burn down his apartment twice because he just leaves things on the stove while it’s on and passes out. Since the day we moved in, we haven’t seen him sober a single day. Even when he has appointments with doctors, he always comes back home drunk. When I clean his room (usually once or twice a week) he always has bottles of alcohol hidden around his room. Last week, I came home from a walk with my cousins who live across the hall from us and went to check up on my grandfather. He was sitting on the floor in the dark, staring at the dead iPad in front of him. He didn’t want to tell me he fell at first, but after he did, he refused to get back up and instead got upset at me for not bringing him my little sister. My mother used to have my grandfather look after my younger sister as it was cheaper than daycare and my grandfather had no issue with spending time with her, but after two incidents, one that ended up with him getting violent with me and one that ended up giving my sister 2nd degree burns on her face (they have healed up and you can’t see the scars on her face anymore), she no longer trusts him around my sister alone. I let him go off on me because it’s easier to deal with than him getting psychical and just told him I’d talk to my mother about it. 

I know that we cannot help him, he’s been an alcoholic for over 40 years. It’s just very upsetting to have to see it every single day and watching my family suffer over this. My aunt and my mother help him as much as they can, but it’s hard to help someone that’s always drunk and never cares. I had given up alcohol a little over a year ago because of my grandfather. I can’t look at a drink without being reminded of him. It’s a bit of a bummer since I’m young and just about to turn 21, so I can go as crazy as I want with alcohol, but the constant fear and trauma from watching him drink himself away has put me off of it entirely. We don’t know how to help and I don’t think we can regardless.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987881779670715}"

I've watched myself change. Turned into a person who forgot his name because it didn't matter. This feeling was to blame. The never ending desire to keep on getting higher till I was not the same.

I think I've forgotten my name, and now its probably hidden in those neurons that i fried the other day. This isn't a headache its my body telling me of all its is pain. Every cell corrupted, right now melting. Ive tortured this body, to forget about it and to live up in my brain. 

But then the day after feels always the same. I think that i've forgotten what being drunk feels like so maybe I should try it again. 

Shut up brain, don't start that game. Your teasing me and it wont work this time, wait a minute aren't we the same?

I can hardly sleep when falling asleep drunk. and I never dream. It feels like dying and waking up to a body that reminds me of that pain. I miss the colors of my dreams, black outs are just plain. 

I dont want to go through that again. I dont want to feel bad about a choice i made that I dont want to make again. 

So this time i think will forgive myself and simply say it was a mistake my friend; I'm sorry body. I'm sorry for the pain.  

We make mistakes, maybe we are broken and that is why we are this way. But its the people that are strong that try and fix mistakes. so I will not dwell in this misery again, i wont insult my self.

Anyway, since I stopped my usual weekend binge drinking, I have replaced that habit with quaffing lots and lots of coffee.  3-4 cups on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  Then I stop drinking coffee during the work week.  

This pattern of compulsive coffee drinking mimics my weekend binge drinking to a tee.  You could say I replaced one compulsion with another, but with coffee I don't slam my liver and other organs with horrible toxins, am not crippled the whole day after by a hangover, and don't send out embarrassing, stupid, maudlin text messages at 3 AM.

Supplanting liquor with coffee and cigars as a weekend pleasure hasn't brought down any unfortunate consequences on me thus far.  Just a little more hyper.  :p

Last year in August I went hard on the booze, after coming to the realization that I should just accept my condition and stop with the self restraint. I've had depressive tendencies since I was a teenager and I was just so fucking tired of trying to hold on, to seem normal. I had done that for over 5 years and there didn't seem to be any reward for doing so.

After this realization, that nothing was ever going to be better and trying was pointless, I drank for a couple months, almost every single day. Decided that I needed help and went to the psychiatrist. Got an antidepressant prescribed and felt hope for a while. Went a bit lighter on the booze for a month or two, drinking a six pack around every other day, sometimes slightly more. Felt like a literal fucking zombie from the AD at the end, after 3 months or so. Quit taking it and started drinking daily, harder than before. Just stopped caring about anything.. This was early Feb this year. I feel like I've burned my brain. No one around me seems to notice it, or they just don't care, but I feel so fucking odd. Like I'm just not here anymore. I don't know if it's the way the AD changed my brain or the alcohol - or I've just changed as a person. The past 3 days alone I've had a 700ml bottle of whiskey each night. This is more than I would drink in the past. Seems like I'm just slowly killing myself with almost no regret. I just can't feel shit anymore and I don't know where to go. I've tried to talk to my close family, but they just don't seem to understand. They care, but I can't feel that I'm being understood. Funnily enough I guess I don't seem that bad on the outside, probably because I'm still fairly young. So people would expect me to exaggerate the amount I'm drinking and not take it seriously.

She said ""All of this for nothing"" and I said ""huh?"" and she goes ""All of this just because I wanted to go be around people"" - and I thought to myself ""No, all of this is happening because you drove under the influence""

How should I approach a conversation with her in the morning when she wakes up to convince her that she does, in fact, have a drinking problem and needs to work on it? Like I said before, she always gets super defensive whenever this is even hinted at, but after tonight I'm done beating the bush and I'm upset that it had to come to a second DUI.

He also had substance problems for multiple years, though he went through rehab and that has been done with for around 3 years (that I know), but he has largely continued drinking, though to varying degrees. It has come to a breaking point where I feel compelled to act on it, but I am not sure what to do. He has been drunk for the past four days, aside from a few hours each morning before work. Thus, he has been driving home while drunk. Additionally, he works as a manager at an AC company, where he uses a company truck during the day to make deliveries and meet clients. I am 100% confident that he has been drinking and driving even while working, so at least 4-5 hours each day for the past 4 days. My mother and I are both nearly done and to the point that we don't care if he drinks and spends his own money on it. However, we both cannot allow the drunk driving. We've taken his car keys and my mom is taking him to and from work to make sure that he doesn't drive drunk, but we cannot control what he does while at work with the company vehicle. He's been drinking for the past 9 hours and was hardly able to stumble up the stairs into bed—he should not be driving. We both want to talk to his boss and make a serious deal out of it, but if he loses his job then it will hurt my mom too, as she won't be able to afford all of the rent and bills on her own. I want to track his location and call to report him as a drunk driver, but I am afraid that he would get fired for that too. On one hand, I am afraid that each day is another chance that he happens to crash and kill an innocent person. On the other hand, it feels like taking one of these actions would financially ruin my mom and even make her homeless. Someone's death is a much worse consequence than financial problems, I get that. But it still feels like I have an impossible choice to make and my mom and I don't know what we can do.

Just turned 36, had quite a few issues with alcohol over the last 20 years. 
Have been trying, but not really trying hard enough with my addiction/problem over the last 10 years if that makes sense.. I address my addiction but let it beat me after a while each time I try.

Psychologist’s have helped me get down to mid strength beers which is a plus, but I still feel the necessity to drink at least 8- 10 a night which is about 10 standard drinks.

I’ve detoxed in hospital before, and ended up staying there for two months in the end, which did me a heap of good. The gym in that time did me even better, and gave me a goal, even though I’d drink afterwards, I’d count my calories so it sorta kept me somewhat motivated to get some gains ha..

have had a few stints on Antabuse, which helped, but this covid nonsense has sucked the motivation out of my soul as my city is in constant lockdown.

I’m a weird drinker, I smoke cigarettes, and I can’t have a beer without a cigarette. If I don’t have cigarettes on me, I can’t even fathom having a drink. But I’ve always got the two paired up and ready to go. Feels like a ocd kind of thing.

If I buy a six pack, I drink a beer in the time it takes me to smoke that cigarette. It’s like a one to one ratio.
I can’t drink a beer without a cigarette. 
So I will polish a six pack and six to eight cigarettes in an hour.

Doctor recommended naltrexone and clonidine because he feels that I may have ADHD (which a few other therapists have said which I’ve ignored), and I actually got off my backside and bought everything he prescribed for me which I plan on starting today because what this Doc told me about ADHD and my drinking issues make so much sense. But I feel pretty weird about it.

Antabuse didn’t help with my cravings, detox and hospital helped to an extent, but the craving would still pop up.
I’m a functional drinker and have always held down a job, but I know I’ve got a problem and haven’t had many days off I’ve the last 12 months..

I’ve done a lot of reading on this sub, and a lot of the stories I read keep me motivated.

I’m in two minds whether I start taking the Nal first thing in the morning, or to try TSM which folks on here seem to swear by, any advice??

The next plunge is the hardest step to take after things not working out how you thought they would, sometimes I just feel like “yep this is it, this shit had got me forever”.

But after reading what I read on here, I know there’s a way out, and life isn’t going to be boring af without alcohol.

So cheers to you guys, 
I hope you’re kicking ass, and I hope I can do the same soon",2,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9826813340187073}"

Hello,

I'll precursor this message with a caveat; this is my first time on this sub, and my second even talking about this problem at all, to anyone. I apologise if my post is a bit jumbled and hard to follow.

As much as I love and care about my dad, I have a growing suspicion that he's a high-functioning alcoholic. I didn't realise before, but recently, it's really been on my mind and I'm worried. He has always provided for me and my brother. He works hard, relentlessly, and I'm very thankful for everything he's done for us over the years. He has never raised a hand on any of us and he never would. He's a caring, compassionate and intelligent man. I enjoy spending a lot of time with him. I'm nineteen years old and I've moved back in with my father and my younger brother for the duration of the lockdown.

In the evening though, that's when I get worried. He has a few small drinks before dinner, nothing too worrying, then we eat and have a nice chat about regular things, and then we start winding down before bed. As soon as we're all done clearing up after eating, and my brother and I have left the room, my father gets a coffee mug from the cupboard and fills it to the brim with wine. I know this because if I come into the room a couple of minutes later to tell him about something funny or whatever, I see the mug, and he moves it out of my sight, as it were, but I've already seen it. When I see it, I don't really feel anything. I feel like I'm probably just burying what I'm seeing into the depths of my mind (I don't think drinking wine out of a full coffee mug is normal behaviour) but I don't think that's necessarily the right course of action, either. Over the course of the evening, I listen out and I hear him refill the mug at least a few more times. His speech grows increasingly slurred over the course of the evening, but it's played off as tiredness. And this is every single night of the year.

I feel bad writing all this. I don't know if that's a normal feeling. My father is a good, caring man, and I don't resent him for having what I think is a problem with drinking. I love him. But I care about him and as I get older, I'm growing more aware of how much he might be damaging his health (and the mental health of himself, my brother and I).

My father falls into a slumber nearly instantly when he goes to bed, which I imagine is caused by the alcohol. However, about an after he falls asleep, he starts moaning and swearing and shouting. When I was younger, I used to just assume he was always having nightmares, but I suspect it might be related to the alcohol consumption mixed with vivid dreams. He moans very loudly, as if he's in pain or feeling intense pleasure, I can't work out which. He swears, too, dishing out some nasty insults, which I really don't think he would do during the day, sober. I remember when I was younger, when the shouting started, I used to cover my ears with my pillow because I found it scary and I didn't want to hear such nasty words coming from my father's mouth.

In recent months, I've started urging my little brother (he's sixteen, and he's honestly the fairest, nicest and most genuine person I know, I love him dearly) to go to bed early-ish. I imagine he thinks it's a harmless request, which it is, but deep down it's because I want him to be asleep before my father starts shouting and swearing, because I don't want him to hear that, even though I know it's probably inevitable.

Eventually, he gets up and starts charging around the house completely naked or nearly, even in the dead of winter. Heavy footfalls which I know doesn't happen sober, or at least not to such extent. I don't know if it's a mixture of sleepwalking/sleeptalking and alcohol, but all of these things I've described above, they're not healthy. Last week, he barged into my room after opening the door, thinking it was his room. When my grandparents were visiting, years ago, a few nights in a row he barged into their room in the middle of the night, giving them a fright. A couple of summers ago, at three in the morning, I was awake in my room, reading a book. I heard my dad walking down the corridor and opening the front door. I was alarmed (I was about sixteen, I think) so I cautiously followed him out. He opened the gate, ran a few meters up the road (quiet area) with absolutely no clothes on, under the glimmer of the streetlights, and into our back garden. My heart was beating like crazy. He then came running back along the road and locked the gate. I ducked out of sight and went back to my bedroom once I was satisfied he was back in the house.

I'm fairly certain he has accidentally drunkenly urinated into the shower instead of the toilet before. If I go to the bathroom at some point after him during the night, there will sometimes be urine on the floor before I get there.

At night, he turns on a light to the bathroom, for example, then leaves it on when he's done, which is something he'd never do awake/sober. He has left the fridge open before at night. A few months ago, he started listening to a radio program at one in the morning with the sound on full whack. I've heard him setting the kettle to boil (something he'd only do in the morning) well into the night, before forgetting about it and going back to bed.

We were visiting our grandparents (my dad's parents) a couple of years ago, he was sleeping in their living room at night, and in the morning, the corner of the room behind the TV was absolutely drenched with colourless liquid (and a couple of electric appliances ruined) when the house has never had any previous encounters with dampness, etc. I have no proof of this, but I think I have a pretty clear idea of what happened, and I'm sure you can guess what I'm thinking.

Back when I was in high school, I remember my alarm going off at six in the morning every morning, and as I walked through the house, I could smell the wine from the previous evening.

It's a completely taboo subject. I've never brought ANY of this up, and I have no idea how I would go about it if I ever was to. I don't want to disturb the ""tranquility"" of the household.

I hope I don't regret writing this, or that I come across as impolite or entitled. I'm not complaining about the situation, but I think I should get it off my chest. Nobody apart from me knows about this. I don't know if it'll affect me harder further down the road, or if I or my brother (I really hope not) will eventually develop drinking problems of our own.

I don't know if he knows I know. Part of me hopes he does, part of me hopes he doesn't. All I know is I really, really hope my brother remains (if he is?) oblivious to it all, because I don't want him to have to worry about these sorts of things. I think I need help, and I needed to put all of this into words. I'm worried about my father's well-being. I care about him and I want him to be happy and healthy. I don't know what to do. I'd like to help, but I have no idea where to start. It feels like a long, dark tunnel.

I'm sorry for the huge wall of text. It's all very raw. Does my father have a drinking problem that I keep subconsciously ignoring? What would you do?",5,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9953816533088684}"

On Monday July 19th, Pastor Dan Cornide of Boynton Beach will join the founder of New Life Ministries, Steve Arterburn on his TV show and podcast *Life Recovery Today*. Cornide, a leader at Recovery Church Delray Beach and founder of the [faith-based addiction treatment program](https://www.allinsolutions.com/faith-based-recovery-program/) at All In Solutions, will discuss the transformative power of combining biblical principles with a 12 step program.

On the heels of a 30 percent spike in overdose deaths last year, Cornide has been a unifying figure who has connected members of the recovery community with like-minded church groups in Palm Beach County. *Life Recovery Today* *with Steve Arterburn*, a Christian counseling talk show that explores how anybody can apply the principles of 12 step recovery programs to overcome spiritual struggles, extended the invite because of Cornide’s undeniable contributions to the rapidly growing Recovery Church Movement. Pastor Dan’s magnetic charisma and unflinching authenticity make him the perfect spokesperson for expanding the spiritual component of addiction recovery through the Christian church. You can watch the interview on the [New Life Ministries Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/NewLifeTV) channel.

Of the opportunity, Pastor Dan said, “It is truly humbling to be invited to the discussion by such influential members of the Christian counseling field. Each individual’s life experience makes them perfectly suited to a particular calling, and my calling has been to invite my brothers and sisters in recovery into the body of the church and into a loving relationship with Christ.”",0,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9978786706924438}"

For my part, I’ve always enjoyed drinking. Throughout college and my early 20s I had occasional binge drinking episodes, but tried to mind the line. 

Fast forward to 2020. The pandemic upended personal and professional life. While I was fortunate enough to have a computer-based job and could work from home, being cooped up in my small apartment with no where to go and no one to see resulted in a sharp increase of alcohol consumption. 

For the past 16 months, I’ve been getting buzzed or blackout drunk every single night. There was never an evening I didn’t drink, and I’d even occasionally day drink. I could easily have 3-4 cocktails and down an entire bottle of wine in a single evening. I was sleeping horribly, had trouble remembering things, and felt constantly depressed and anxious. 

I woke up on Saturday morning realizing I could barely remember the night before, what was probably a lovely dinner at a 5-star restaurant with my boyfriend. I felt sad for myself that I was literally missing my life. I realized I was drinking out of habit. I realized alcohol was stealing so much from me. 

So I decided to stop drinking. 

I’m honestly not yet sure if this is a temporary or permanent break. All I know is it has been five days and I’ve slept well every night, my mind feels sharper, and I don’t feel as depressed. I realized I can fill my evenings with hobbies and interests rather than alcohol. And I’m really happy and thankful.

This made things far worst than they should’ve after this moment in time I drove drunk as I could ever possibly be and a police office pulled me over. He knew I was drunk and even asked me if I was drinking but in the third question he asked and proceded to let me go. I felt alone. I felt worthless. I felt destroyed. At twenty one there I was behind the wheel escaping the authorities or at least I thought. Driving off and being let of I stumbled upon a high mountain with out any internet service or care from my relationship.  All of sudden I drove speeding down the mountain then lost control of the car. Ended up crashing the car as the blood streamed all over my hands. I looked up to the sky around 2:00AM and questioned my whole life after this I seeker God for the first time in my life. At this moment I asked him to deliver me without phone service, drunk, and a completely totaled vehicle. Less than fifteen minutes go by and a random kind soul picks me up in the middle of nowhere. First thing he does is come up to me throws away the bottle that is left in the car accident then took me 3 hours to the doorstep of my house. He told me my whole entire life story and how he had a son who is prison for life. When I was dropped off he didn’t give me his name or want to take the $ I was offering him. After this I don’t think I will ever be the same.

I was the worst alcoholic I knew. I had such shame and guilt and self loathing for things that I did. I felt so alone because nobody I knew did shit like that. I am here to tell you, you are not alone.

I committed suicide. My bf at the time came home just an hour after he left (instead of 8) and found me unresponsive. I woke up the next day in the hospital pissed and on a 5150. I talked my way out of it, telling the shrink that I ""accidentally"" took too much of my sleeping meds. I actually convinced myself that was the truth and didn't face it until I was in rehab years later.

I drove Lyft drunk and in blackouts. I justified it because I don't like dealing with people, so I'd get a little blurry and I got great ratings. But you know how we do, it escalated from blurry to tipsy to drunk to blackouts.

I have pissed my bed so many times that it just became reflex to tilt it against the wall to dry when I left for work.

I pissed in my driver's seat, more than once, when driving Lyft. 

I drank a Costco sized bottle of vanilla extract because it was the only thing in the house with alcohol and then gaslit the shit out of my mom about it which was particularly dispicable because 1. She's a recovering alcoholic (36 years) and 2. I have been gaslit and know how terrible it is.

I got drunk on the bus, got lost and was so faded I couldn't figure out how to get home and couldn't get an Uber because I drank my last money, only had a bus card.

I have lost or broken more than 1 phone in blackouts. Purses, keys, jackets, etc.

I have humiliated my family in blackouts more than once and can't really remember how, just know it was *bad* from the wisps of memory I have left.

I got blackout drunk one New Years and cheated on my boyfriend with my ex and didn't even KNOW until 2 weeks later after my ex mentioned it. (I confessed to my bf and we got thru it)

I hit something in my car in a blackout and tore off the right front quarter panel. Found it the next morning and freaked. Told my bf at the time that I was going to go out for a bit and went to Pick-a-Part and replaced it, never told anyone till rehab.

I, who took autoshop in high school and knew better, had 2 oil changes in 8 years and seized my car's engine, bricking it. 

I drank at work and ended up losing my job of 15 years. 

Lost my apartment. 

Hit more than 1 parked car and never left a note. 

And more but I think this is enough. 

2 years ago, I admitted that I needed help, at age 46, after 30 years of abuse. Took 2 months to get into rehab.

I was terrified. Totally. I felt like I was alone. But I wasn't. There I learned that there are many like me. Much like our skin, our stories differ, but strip that away and we are indistinguishable. We are not alone. 

I have +22 months now. It absolutely sucks to live with your parents at 48, no car, no job. But I started school to become an alcohol and drug counselor which I will finish in a few months. I have to start over from scratch but that's okay. I have never had a sober adult life and I am grateful and excited to now.

 If you think it's too late to quit, that the damage is already done, that there is no hope, then this is for you.

I just got off the phone with my doctor. I am 22 months sober after 25+ years of daily drinking, about 30 drinks a day when I was hospitalized in October 2019. They drained 6 1/2 liters of fluid out of my abdomen two hours after I was taken to the ER by my sister and wife. ""Fluid"" being everything that my liver and kidneys couldn't process and was leaking. It looked like thin chocolate. Sorry to be graphic but I can picture it vividly snaking through the tube into a jar. My liver function was 15% and my kidney function was 30%. It was touch and go for 4 days in ICU while I was treated for withdrawal, then 4 days in a regular room. When I was discharged it was straight to rehab. My wife stopped at a big box store to buy me XXL sweatpants, shirts and size 13 slippers because my feet were split and swollen. I couldn't go in because I was still in my hospital gown and could barely walk anyway. My skin was split in numerous places from the swelling and skin was falling off of my lower legs and feet. I don't have ready access to my early bloodwork but my AST, ALT and Bilirubin were TRIPLE the high end of normal.

My original hospital doctors treated me with dignity but didn't give me much hope. They just kept saying I was lucky to be alive and ""time would tell"". The physicians assistant that took charge of my care the last two days until the present DID give me hope though and beams from ear to ear when I see her now. We have cried together on occasion about my recovery. My rehab physician was awesome as well and told me story after story of people recovering from near death. Now he has one more story to tell!

These were my numbers at 5 months sober following every instruction:  
AST 20 Normal 13-39  
ALT 27 Normal 7-52  
Bilirubin .7 Normal .3-1.0

You can't get much more ""normal"" than that! The results my doctor just read to me were about the same @ 22 months sober. I have ultrasounds and bloodwork every 6 months and last week I had what I call a ""Hi-Def Ultrasound"" (elastography) where they test the liver tissue in depth. they like to wait over a year for everything to ""settle down"" before doing this test. Up until now my diagnosis has been Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis. I kept asking if I had Cirrhosis and they kept telling me that it didn't matter because the treatment was the same... don't drink! This test actually determined if I have clinical Cirrhosis. My liver was graded on a scale of 1 (healthy) to 4 (cirrhotic). My grade was a 2.5 There was no chance it would be 0 and it never will be but both her and I are thrilled with that score!

I followed instructions, followed up, and followed those that have gone before me on the path to sobriety. for the first time in my life, I followed instead of trying to do everything myself.

If you are drinking now, please consider quitting. You will not get away with this forever. You will NOT. I hit a point where I figured if I wasn't sick yet, that I was special and would never get sick. This just doesn't happen.

If you just quit, keep it up! You too will see improvements like mine. The liver is an amazing organ! We can get better! Life gets better, in every aspect. If you feel like hell now, I'm sorry, but you wont' feel like this forever!

If you quit a while ago, I'm so proud of you. Both for doing what had to be done and for coming back here to help others!

I wanna hear that SOB break in half.""

I’ve been on a bender from July 3rd through Sunday. I managed to keep it mild at first but shocker it escalated very quickly. It got to the point that after an argument with my gf last Monday I basically finished a bottle everyday there after. Didn’t show up to work, ignored phone calls, locked myself in my room, and avoided everyone in my life. I woke up Monday morning thinking I had ruined my life. I was sure I was being fired, my family wouldn’t talk to me, and my friends would be disgusted. I was shocked. 

My mom admitted to me that she knew I had a problem and told me she’s there to help. That’s why she’s been reaching out so much. A buddy of mine also admitted he’d known for awhile, and reminded that I’m a bad and dangerous path. Something that he didn’t want to see and that he’s there for me. The biggest surprise was my boss. I thought he’d be livid when I showed up Monday but he sat me down and told me he wasn’t mad about work, he was mad I didn’t consider him part of my support network. Shared some of his personal struggles and told me there’s no judgement, but if this happens again call him before it gets bad. No judgement or rules, he’ll put me in a hotel to just get me out of a negative environment.

I suffer a lot right now ... when you drink a lot every night since 5 years the problem just don’t go away instantly. I’m going to a meeting tonigh... Im in the right direction I think.

Tomorrow I’m going to restaurant and I’m mindset to max 2 beer... if I can 1. I know I can do it and I believe in my self. I know sober is not drinking but for now and for my health I try yesterday and it was to fast and to drastic I will come there hopefully. I should say I know and believe in me. 

The restaurant is not the problem I will do it like a champion I’m sure... my problem is everytime I have a social activity... I drink normal or a lot like others but in my head I one more !! So I’m rushing into the store after for be drunk at my place alone without judgement and get waisted.

I want to have a good time at the restaurant and not let my problem take control of me when I get home and not drink after because I don’t need more its in my head.

Am I the only one who use to do that ? And stress and rush to home for drink more was more important then enjoy the moment with a friend ? 

Any trick ?

** I modified my post for Im gonna try to not drink at all even at the restaurant. Giving me the permission to have 1 or 2 max beer it’s like I already know I’m gonna fail and can’t do it.

I made a horrible mistake that I’m so ashamed and blackout ... couldn’t remember the next morning. That was scary because yes I drink everyday since 5 years but that kind of things doesn’t happen to me because I drink alone in a safe place.... the only person I hurt it’s my self and I have such low estime of my self that I don’t care at all.

the day after for forget my fist mistake I did it again till I black out and that mistake was even worst !

Thank god I figure out saving my ass in both différents situations and have a second chance. I put my self in major danger like maybe rape and even death  and I lie to my friends wich I’m feeling awfull but I will had any if I said the true...

Now I have a second chance but there is no way i will  be lucky like that all my life, even a second time and I also need to learn how to forget my self. 

Yesterday I reached the group and take one last beer before I quit definitely. I was done !! All your comments make me believe that I can do it too :) mentality I want more then ever and I’m still am! but then my heart beat last night starting like crazy, I had sweet, smoking cigarettes like crazy for trying to control my self with anxiety, having nausea , diarrhea and felling kind of drunk even if I was sober. I taught I was more taught physically then that.

I don’t want to worry anybody’s. I wait till it was 24h sober since my only last beer and buy 2 at the really last minute for making sure I can’t have more after and have any in my fridge (and it was never the case.) I know it’s not quitting like I wanted so bad but the physical pain was too painful like you saying? Cold turkey...I feel better physically but not super good at all....It’s hard but I know my health is not in danger anymore.

I should feel like a failure because thoses mistakes was not enaught to make me stop and be 100% sober for 48h. But at the same time I feel so proud that I resist buying a full pack... normally I will told my self fuck it it’s already a fail...I will get wasted and start over tomorrow. And over. 

I fail but I’m proud because I want to do it better tomorrow and each day and I start this journey and still resist the cravings. At the same time I feel like  a failure because I can’t stay sober just for 2 days? There is absolutely no congratulations for drinking 2 beer tonight.

Thank you if you read my long text feel like a relief just writing and sorry for my bad English. This is not because I’m intoxicated....it’s not my first language and I don’t know all the proper words about this subject...

2021-07-13 02:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/oj9oce/my_sister_showed_up_drunk_to_visit_my_dying/,My sister showed up drunk to visit my dying father and assaulted us.,"We put my father on hospice yesterday. He had been declining, but this was somewhat of a shock to the family. We made the decision because he had clearly stated his wishes in past about not wanting to be on life support if he became very sick.  His condition would have required him to be on a ventilator if he was to be saved. He is in a facility while he passes to help care for his needs. We are all sad,  but my mother is losing her husband of 50 years,  so we are trying to really support her.

My mother and I were at the facility sitting with my dad and my sister showed up. She is an alcoholic and recently nearly died from falling down a flight of stairs and fracturing her skull in several places (as a result of drinking). She stopped drinking,  but never went to rehab or got any help. It was this big secret too because her and her hubby are super worried about their image.  Anyway,  she started again and we were suspicious that she was even before she came to visit. She was being loud and weird and I asked her if she had been drinking. My mom was really upset.  She became very defensive and of course denied it,  but we are not stupid. We explained to her that we care about her and are concerned,  but she was still angry and tried to leave.  I told her that I was not going to allow her to drive in her condition.  We tried to explain to her that her behaviors were awfully strange and that a sober person would not do that. She called us every name in the book,  including telling my mother that she is a stupid b****. 

I called her hubby and told him to come get her,  but he was 90 minutes away.  She tried to leave again and again we tried to stop her. She then pushed my mom and me and hit me, right next to my father on his deathbed. She was also calling my mom a b**** again and saying f- you.  I called the police because I was not waiting 90 minutes for her hubby to show up to get her and allow her to verbally and physically assault us anymore. (Also,  my mother is an amazing wife and mother) 

Later she apologized,  but said that it was very dramatic to call the police. (Not a true apology in my opinion). Her hubby agrees. My fiancé is torn about what he thinks,  but he does not like the police.  My brother and mom agree that I did the right thing.  However,  we did not press assault charges and she was not officially arrested.  The police waited with her until her codependent husband arrived to get her. 
I thought it was horrible what she did.  

Who verbally and physically assaults their mother while her husband and our father is dying on the bed in the room? My dad was very agitated during the incident too. He was restless and got really sweaty. I want him to pass in peace and comfort! He was agitated for hours afterward,  even with meds.

Hey all, I come to you asking for advice with my SO's drinking problem. For a little bit of context, she's in her mid 20's and has been drinking pretty regularly since she was 18 or so. Throughout those years she's fluctuated back and forth between being a decently bad alcoholic and actually drinking moderately. She struggles with bipolar disorder and anxiety that she takes medication for as well. I'm not a drinker, usually I only drink at gatherings and only a few drinks.

We've been together for about 2 years, in which I feel she's starting to spiral again recently. She's currently out of work and tends to go buy a 6pack w/ hard liquor or a 12pack whenever she's home alone and I'm at work. (I work night shift). Usually this means that as long as she has leftover money from her employment insurance, she's buying booze 2-4 days in a row and getting drunk alone while playing video games. If she runs out, she'll frequently walk drunk to the store to buy more. She's only gotten blackout drunk once in the time we've been together, but she usually goes until she's pretty far gone. I should mention she isn't drinking or drunk 24/7, she usually drinking over the course of 8-12hrs at night. This is also partly why she believes there's no issue. 

I've made many attempts to try to help her and get her to cut down, but any success is usually short lived. It always comes back around to her getting upset and saying that I'm trying to be controlling, or stop her from having fun, that it's not a problem because she can still function day-to-day, and that she doesn't want to stop or cut down because it's how she has fun. If I cut her off she'll often get angry and yell at me for being ""unreasonable"", and generally just say lots of mean things. The last time I had to cut her off at a friends get-together because she was too far gone, she started to get angry and a little bit suicidal because I wasn't letting her drink anymore. When we got home she yelled at me about how she was going to move out, and we should break up because she only cares about alcohol and being drunk. I know that she doesn't actually feel that way, but she gets very overly emotional and argumentative when she's drunk. (I recognize that this kind of behavior is emotional abuse, and I'm taking steps for myself to keep safe, so please don't worry about me.) At this point I was exhausted and just gave up, told her to do whatever she wanted. She very quickly cheered up and ordered a big bottle of hard liquor for delivery while I went to sleep. As per usual in the morning after this kind of situation happens, she acts like nothing happened. It's like its a 50/50 chance that we get into a fight over literally anything anytime she's drunk. I do my best to avoid anything that could lead to one, but she takes everything personal when she's drunk and gets overly emotional/argumentative with anger as I mentioned.

I should also note that constantly spending the money she does on booze is certainly not helping her financial situation. She has a few maxed out credit cards that she makes no attempt to pay off as she'd rather spend the money on other things, including booze. If she runs out of money and has some room on a card from making the minimum payment, she'll bring it back up to the limit from booze spending.

I'm really at a loss for what to do. I don't have anything against responsible drinking as I enjoy it myself sometimes, but she makes me feel like I'm the problem. Like I shouldn't be upset over it, I'm the bad guy for not letting her do what she likes to do to have fun, etc... She just used to actually call herself and alcoholic and admit that she has a problem, now she just refuses to believe she's doing anything wrong in wanting to be drunk all the time. I'm really trying to push her to find a new job as she generally will only drink 1-2 days a week on days off while she's employed, so I think that would be a huge help to her. Beyond that, I feel completely stuck. Any and all advice is appreciated, I really want to help her.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986070990562439}"

I spent 5 days ALONE in a hotel not know what my next steps should be. Do I have a place to go back to?  I told my 5 kids that he was a jerk and left me and now they hate him and refuse to come over if I go back to living with him.  

Well I am staying at my ex’s house (for a price) for a month but at least I’m with my kids when they aren’t out and about. My bf still loves me and wants me back. I want to go back but the kids…???

And I’m seriously thinking about drinking now?  I must be insane. At least writing this has made me realize that I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY. 

Any thoughts anyone?  Do I go back to the bf my kids hate?  Or do I get my own place. (I already found a place and have been approved for it)

Help!  I need to hear good reasoning. ( I am praying about it btw)",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979615211486816}"

2021-07-11 05:00:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/oi135p/the_stages_of_alcoholism/,The Stages of Alcoholism,"I’m trying to learn more about alcoholism and I came across [this article](https://www.healthline.com/health/stages-alcoholism), which lays out the progressive stages of Alcohol Use Disorder. 

While informative, I thought this article lacked a certain… flair. So, I thought it’d be useful (and maybe a little fun) to make my own list. Here are some of the “other” stages of alcoholism, based on my own life experience, in no particular order. Feel free to add your own. 

**The “I’ll Just Uber From Now On” Stage**

For when you don’t trust yourself not to over-drink, regardless of the occasion, so you ride with a friend or Uber pretty much everywhere. 

**The “If I only drink on Wednesdays and Saturdays…” Stage**

Also known as the bargaining stage. 

You say to yourself, “If I only drink on Wednesdays and Saturdays, that’ll give my liver enough time to recover! Of course, I’ll probably drink Friday too, I do have that work party... And I’m going golfing with my parents on Sunday… ahh to hell with it.” 

Don’t ever believe any of these little deals your brain tries to make with itself. It’s just the addiction finding sneaky ways to make you use again. 

**The “Fall in the Bathroom and Break Your Neck” Stage**

This one might just be me. 

RIP, C4 vertebrae. 

**The “Well, At Least I Don’t Drink as Much as Gary” Stage**

Here’s the thing, you’re not Gary. Just because your friend throws up on himself and gets thrown out of Applebee’s, that doesn’t change the fact that you just washed down your mozzarella sticks with five pints of poison. 

**The “Gain A Bunch of Weight at 25 Because Your Metabolism Slows Down and You Can’t Drink Like You Used To” Stage**

Happens to the best of us, man. 

**The “I Think I Might Be Gluten Intolerant” Stage**

“Oddly enough, when I drink 15 beers in one sitting, my tummy feels a little weird... Do you think it might be the gluten?” 

**The “I’m Switching to Vodka Because it’s Less Calories” Stage**

Famous last words. 

**The “I’ve Actually Been Getting Really Into Wine/Craft Beer/Whiskey Lately…” Stage**

We all go through our snobby years— as if waking up with a massive headache and red teeth makes you any less of a booze hound. 

**The “I Really Need to Stop Drinking And Driving” Stage**

Let me make one thing very clear: back in my drinking days, I NEVER drank and drove. Except for all those times I totally did. 

**The “Whose House is This?” Stage**

“Whose house is this? I remember that dog, that’s the only thing I remember from last night.”

**The “Drinking Game” Stage**

Some people never grow out of this stage. This is super gross to me, I don’t know why. There’s nothing sadder than watching a 35-year-old line up cups for beer pong. I’ll never judge you for being an alcoholic, I totally understand that. But leave the college boy shit in college, man! You need to be a little less worried about the death cup and a little more worried about saving for retirement. 

**The “Police Encounters” Stage**

Some people never grow out of this stage, either. Far be it for me to be the guy giving drinking advice on a subreddit focused on recovery, but if at any point in the night you find yourself talking to a police officer, you’re doing it wrong. Plan your night better. 

**The “I Need to Remember to Drink Water” Stage**

I’ve never been more preoccupied with hydration than when I was an alcoholic. Ironically, I was never less hydrated. 

I had a lot of thoughts like, “I need to remember to eat if I’m drinking tequila… I need to bring some Pedialyte if I’m going to be in the sun all day…” 

It’s funny, you’ll change everything about your behavior, aside from the drinking. 

**The “I Just Smoke When I’m Drinking” Stage**

Drinking is a real gateway drug for all kinds of very dumb behavior. 

**The “I’ll Quit Eventually” Stage**

When you’re an addict, there’s no better time than eventually.

I’m being kinda whimsical here, obviously there’s also some really dark shit going on as well. But hopefully we can laugh about our problems sometimes, too. 

It’s funny how basic our brains are. We think we’re all alone, that nobody has ever had the thoughts we’re having. But then you talk to other addicts and we’re all thinking the same shit. We’re all running the same faulty computer programs.

Currently, I'm battling Acid Reflux due to years of alcohol. Started drinking in college back in 2007. It was almost every day and I've considered myself a functioning alcoholic at the time. I was 20 years old when I started. I've finished school, of course, in 2012 with a B.A. in Studio Art. In the summer of 2014, I was diagnosed with Acid Reflux/GERD and in November, my asthma came back after 2 years, leading me to take medication and a nebulizer. I had weight gain problems, vomiting, and eating big portions of food. It made me 260 lbs and pre-diabetic/borderline. Since last year, I've cut down from 4 or 5 days a week with alcohol to twice a week. Now, I'm down to one drink a week since I started doing Yoga and cardio back in April 2021. The last drink I had was on a Sunday and I couldn't finish that one drink. So far I've lost 19 lbs and still going, changed eating habits, and I haven't thought about picking up a bottle at all. My goal is to get to 186 by the end of the year or in mid-January 2022. My medication is now down to just Montelukast (Singular) for one pill a night and that's it. So, that's a lot of progress, I guess. The crazy thing about it is that I've never been to AA at all. The constant drinking took me until 2018 when I started caring for my mother who is sick with ESRD and going to dialysis. As of right now, my acid reflux is under control, but the damage is done. I just have to keep going with the change of my eating habits - eating the right foods, cooking the right foods, and portion control of meals.

The reason why I'm keeping a steady pace to stop drinking completely is because I'm doing this for me and living for my mother. Alcoholism runs in my late father's side of the family (he died of lung cancer due to drinking and smoking in 1995) and I don't want to disappoint his spirit. I know he's proud of me in the afterlife driving trucks in the sky, but I want to make him a lot more proud. My mom is already proud of me, but I want to see her beaming with pride and joy.

Because of Yoga and meditation, I am thankful that I am comfortable in talking with my mother about a lot of things, including alcoholism. I admit my alcoholism and Yoga and meditation saved me. Oh, and using Nintendo Switch for Yoga Master and Ringfit Adventure as well.

To anyone who's in recovery or just started in recovery, have you had any instances where your stomach is hurting and know that you have acid reflux? Inquiring minds want to know. I would like to hear your stories. Thanks for reading mine.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9894154071807861}"

I was wondering if I can get some tips, as I am still pretty fresh to alcohol and alcoholism. I have been drinking for probably 6 months straight: about two tall boys that are at least 6-9% a night. Frankly, I am not sure I will even experience that much of a withdrawal from the amount I am drinking, but as I am new to this, I am not sure and am nervous. 

Currently I am in weed withdrawal and did not want to stop the alcohol at the same time, as alcohol can help me a bit with the serious insomnia I get from stopping weed, but at this point I am considering tapering from the alcohol, as i would like to be semi normal by the 28th for when I go on a trip. 

So what do yall think? What severity of symptoms should i expect, if any? Should I taper (go down to one tall boy, and then maybe one normal can over three days)?

They  were 5 years sober this year, but something happened in their life to cause a relapse. They had been drinking for a few months. They told my mom, who swore she wouldn't tell anyone else because they felt ashamed. They didn't tell his sponsor, nor their sponsee. Tney still attended meetings, but I guess they would drink in between. I wished they had communicated  that they  were struggling with me, but I'm not sure how much difference that would have made.

That bottle has been calling my name bad this week. I've never wanted to drown my feelings so much, but I know it wont help. Who knows though, I certainly am numb enough to say screw it and buy something, but for now I'm holding it at bay. 

If you're struggling, even if you're ashamed, reach out to loved ones. I'm not mad they relapsed, after all you're always a recovering alcoholic, never a recovered alcoholic. I'm very proud that I got 5 more years with my sibling I didn't think I was going to get.

I just started a new job recently.  I didn't know what a shit show it was until I was hired.  It's a second job / server at a restaurant gig.  I like the work usually but the management was so incompetent.  I didn't know how deep the incompetence ran until I started to work there.  

Before, I would have gone straight to the bar or gas station immediately.  But I didn't.  This would have turned into some straight bullshit before.  I'd be on some kind of binge.  But not today.  And that is a victory.  

No matter what happens, alcohol is NOT going to make it better.  Everything I've built up to this point will be gone and everything I hate will come back.  The good eating habits, the work I've put in on the treadmill, my clarity, THE TRUST I HAVE NOW, gone.  Bad eating habits,  damaging my body,  spending habits,  hospital visits will all be back.  It's just not worth it.  At all.

Stay sober, even when it's rough.  Because we all know it could be and will get worse if we drink.

I thought a month in the hospital for alcoholic cardiomyopathy—which came with an ICU stay for withdrawal, encephalopathy, psychosis and dementia, followed by a week in a cognitive/physical rehab facility—would be enough of a wakeup call. But, he walked to a liquor store and bought a bottle of gin on his first day home. The mental component of addiction that drives him to do this without thinking is like watching a person that's been bitten by a zombie suddenly become one.

His breathing is labored, constantly. He will probably die gasping for air as his heart finally gives out, because it's only at 20 percent capacity right now and will most likely never get better. One doctor said most patients who get to this point die within a year, even if they completely stop using.

I wish there was more that I could do to make him want to live, but the grip the disease has is so powerful. I drove him to dual-diagnosis rehab yesterday, which he went to after a long discussion as a family ""because I know you all want me to"". A last-ditch, this-is-the-last-help-I-can-give-you gesture on my part. He has no desire to truly get better, and no care or sense of what it's done to our family.

I have been preparing myself for the inevitability of this for years, yet sitting next to him in the car and hearing him wheeze as he talked, forget things we talked about recently or key details about our own lives, and then falling asleep mid conversation just left me feeling like I'm actually watching him die. But, it's in the slowest, most torturous way possible for him, and the entire family that has been working to help him save himself. The sadness I feel is so profound, yet I am also numb to all of it.

For anyone who is in active addiction, know that people care about you and want you to get better. Even if you don't know who they are, or think they don't care anymore, some of them do. And for the families for whom this monster is a presence, I wish you all peace however you can find it.

I found out that I can have 16 free therapy sessions. I decided to move forward. I filled out an intake form, researched the available therapists, and scheduled a virtual session that took place this morning. 

The therapist had technical difficulties on her end. The video was lagging and her voice kept cutting in and out. We decided to scratch the video chat and have a phone conversation instead. We talked for nearly 50 minutes, then she told me that she wasn't a good fit for me. She said that I would benefit from a longer term, in person therapy and sent me back to the website to select a new therapist. I told her that there were no available in person therapists in my area. She said that it was okay, and they could meet with me via video. 

W.T.F.....?

Has anyone ever had this happen to them? I'm not sure why she passed me along. I was polite, I don't have anything crazy going on, I just drink too much and suffer from a little depression. The whole situation just has me perplexed and feeling rejected. I hand selected this woman for treatment and she is passing me off. I felt really comfortable with her too.

I have an amazing relationship with my boyfriend. He is smart, educated, has exceptional career history, treats me well, everything. He really is fantastic. Except for the alcoholism. He has struggled for years and years and years. 4 trips to rehab. Tried AA. Tried Naltrexone, Vivitrol, & Antabuse. Really hates 12 step programs and faith based programs. He has gone for periods of not drinking for as long as 8 months, but always slips back into it. The last six months it’s been increasing from once or twice a month to once a week to most days. 

He lies. I know alcoholics lie. We have a deal that as long as he is honest and I know what I’m dealing with I won’t get mad. But he lies every time. The thing is, it’s like he isn’t tolerating alcohol anymore like he used to. He used to drink truckloads. Now, he has one or two drinks and he is noticeably affected.  So if he sneaks to the bar at a restaurant for a shot, I can tell. If he stops on his way home and has a drink, he behaves like a drunk the rest of the night. He only has to have a double shot of whiskey to seem drunk. And that behavior isn’t a fun drunk. I find him sleeping out on the lawn. He had two drinks at a bar and tried to ride his scooter home and ended up running into the door of the bar! (Bartenders called me to come get him) I found him last weekend passed out in 105 degree heat in his riding jacket on the grass across the street with his bike tipped over on the sidewalk. After less than 4 drinks. He thinks he is more fun but he gets annoying and rude. 

He wants to quit. Really really does. Is willing to try about anything. Is convinced nothing will work. Feeling defeated. Feels like all rehabs are like the ones he has tried. Institutional lockdown scheduled twelve step programs. He also has spent a ten of thousands on rehabs only to be released and drink the same day. 

He has no triggers. Waking up is a trigger. He feels like life is better with a buzz. He is 50 and when he was younger (20-30 years ago) did other drugs (coke, meth) and is frustrated because he quit those without rehab or issue but can beat alcohol. And his entire adult life he has been a professional, successful man. But the alcohol has cost him several relationships including a marriage. He left a job because of it. He now lives with this frustration of feeling helpless and also feeling anhedonic (is that the right word?) 

We have a good life. Travel, family around, goals. This is just an elephant in the room and he wants to quit but is at a loss. He takes antidepressants and sees a counselor but clearly still drinks. 

FINALLY MY ACTUAL QUESTION:
Has anyone tried ketamine therapy for their alcoholism? I have read it can be up to 80+% effective in reducing cravings and preventing relapse. It’s also a whole lot less expensive than inpatient rehab. 

Also curious if anyone has gone through Schick Schadle aversion therapy. I would love some feedback on that program.

My current phase of hangovers for the last couple years include that hyperreality again but with hearing like there's styrofoam breaking in my ears as well as a lot sweating while my body goes from hot to cold and shaking like I'm shivering.

Hi,

Last year my son moved in with my due to COVID concerns at his apartment, he was 23. He was working remotely for the first 6 months, but around December he lost his job. He, in the past, has had alcohol issues but was clean for 2 years up until this point. On the day he lost his job he relapsed and when I came home to find him passed out drunk on the couch and I was livid. I shook him awake screaming and he slapped me out of reflex in his half asleep state. I called the cops, he got taken away and given a domestic, I didn't sign the no contact thing. He came back the next day and has been sober, doing well, employed ever since.

This was an incredibly isolated incident. Apart from any incidents involving alcohol (which besides this havent happened for years) I am extremely close with my son. I really cant understate how out of character this is for him.

He is going back through counselling and anger management due to this incident, and in the last 6 months he has been the best housemate one could ask for. No trouble, no alcohol, cooks and cleans every night, takes care of the pets, insists to have a sit down family dinner every night to discuss our days, you name it, he does it. Truly a wonderful person but with that looming problem of being your standard recovering alcoholic.

He told me that the prosecution is willing to offer deferred prosecution, 2 years of staying out of trouble and they drop it. I have no doubt that he can make it 2 years without getting in to any trouble. I called his lawyer to ask if there was anything I could do to ensure the judge would accept this plea deal. His Lawyer told me that since I wasnt his client and that he was representing my Son he couldn't help me. My Son told me that a letter from his Mother would help.

I have never written a letter to a judge. What do I include? I definitely wont deny this happened, because it did, but what could I say to help the situation? What things should I touch on?

I think this was a real eye opening moment for him. He's doing so well now, he finally got the job of his dreams, he's 100% sober, he's so pleasant and happy, he's extremely involved with the family, he's back to the son I knew before he started drinking. I'm scared this could throw everything off kilter. What should I include in my letter to the Judge to advocate for this 2 year deferred prosecution for him. I obviously dont think he should get totally off the hook but if he proves he's sober and good for 2 years thats all I'd like to see.

From my reading about domestics I hear that the victims are generally overly sympathetic towards their abusers, but in this case I dont think that applies. My son had a relapse and he fucked up big time, but over the last 3 years this is the only incident and sober he truly is an amazing person. I really want to do everything I can to keep the status quo as it is and have him continue living a life of hard work and sobriety rather than getting thrown a curveball by the legal ramifications of the dumbassery he displayed that day.

Even when blackouts had me missing for a day here and there and no one knew where I was, even then no on said...

""We're concerned about you and want you to get help.""

But you know what?

It's okay. 

It was not my family's place or anyone else's to name my demon for me and even if they had, I would have just drank more out of guilt and shame.

As hard as it is to come to terms with this stuff on your own, its your journey to come to terms with. 

No one else can do it for you.

Don't let guilt and shame keep you from living the rest of your life sober in mind, body and spirit.

You don't even have to use a label that society has stigmatized and applied more guilt and shame too.

All you have to do is name the problem, whatever it might be within your story.

There is no shame in that. 

It is not admitting defeat. 

It is admitting you are ready to be free.

And free you will be, my friends!

Much love and life,

If you are struggling with recovery right now, this post may be difficult to read. Click away if you need to, and have a great  day:^)* 

I’m surrounded by enablers, who I feel as though would judge me for the fact that I have this problem. I wanna do this on my own, but every time before I pour myself another I just keep telling myself that it’s fine. It’s fine because every other college kid my age is “getting lit” every night with their friends. It’s fine because beer chugging competitions are a thing. It’s fine because frat boys probably slam back four times the CDC’s definition of ‘too many drinks per week’ in one night twice a week, and they go on to be doctors and layers and they get to be okay. Its fine because my coworkers always go get hammered at the bar after half their shifts, too. It’s fine because “I can’t stop whenever I want”. 

Yet, none of it is fine. Lord only knows the damage I’m doing to my brain, my liver, and probably some other soft parts. I know it’s not fine, but what I’m struggling with is the idea that it’s not *normal*. Because here in america it feels so, *so* normal. And everyone around you seems to think so too. What’s not fine is totally normal, and what’s best for yourself is weird.

When I do quit drinking, I’m not going to be going to the bar with all my coworkers, and they’re all going to ask me why, and if I tell them I’m an alcoholic, that’s all they’re going to see me as. If I don’t tell them why, they are just going to assume I hate them. And it’s not just them, it feels like everyone. I don’t want to be the “sober” girl and the buzzkill when as a neurodivergent person I’ve already struggled *so* much just to be socially accepted. Everyone just wants to drink, and the people who don’t want to drink just want to smoke, and the people who don’t do either are just far too zealous about it. I’m sure there are a plenty of exceptions, but I’ve yet to meet them for one, and for two, the smoking/drinking trap unfortunately applies to all of my lifelong friends.

And I know I’m on the right path to quitting, but I feel like I need the reassurance that I’m not going to be treated like a freak once I do.

I hardly have any drive left in life, the harder I try, the more I fail. What's the point? I quit my job drinking 30 shots a week, and just last week I downed 127. Every period of progress is followed by things becoming so much worse. I used to be fit and have a job, now I'm fat and spend most days either hungover or busy getting drunk. I've got money saved up, and all the time in the world, but all I ever spend it on is getting drunk.

I try quitting, but after a few hours I have insomnia and can't sleep, and after 1-3 days my brain becomes trapped in this fog where I lose the ability to focus. I tried tapering down from my usual fifth per night, but I never broke below 8 shots. Every attempt I make to cut back or quit, I always seem to rebound twice as hard. I make rules like: only buy what I intend to consume that night, don't start drinking until after the liquor stores close, don't finish off whatever's left when you wake up the next morning, etc. and they work, right up until they don't anymore. Buying in bulk is cheaper so I buy in bulk. tomorrow's a holiday weekend and the liquor store's closed - better stock up.

Things were going well for a couple months, I cut back to 8-10 shots per night, I was creating a habit of hiking during the day to replace my day drinking, I made a new friend online, I was getting excited about doing things with my life other than drinking myself to death, I felt far fewer withdrawals - things were good. But then life happens, and I start thinking about the years of my life I've thrown away, the thousands of dollars lost to alcohol, the autism and anxiety that caused me to start drinking in the first place. So I went back to binging and day drinking, back to feeling hopeless and worthless. The friend I made, I haven't messaged in over two weeks, and I feel like the friendship has probably been ruined. The weight I lost from hiking 3-4 times a week and drinking \~1000 fewer calories per day, right back where it used to be. Why can't I just be content with even just a few hours of sobriety? Why can't I maintain the drive to do more with my life than drink, for more than a few weeks at most?

Sorry for the long post, it's late here and I've got insomnia, because I'm all out of liquor since I decided not to buy more until tomorrow. So I'm hopping that tomorrow(technically today ig) I can start over with tapering back down to 8 or so shots, and then maybe try switching to beer for a week or two, before taking a good long break from drinking.

2021-07-06 23:48:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ofb41t/ranting/,Ranting,"My name is Sarah, and I'm 16 years old. My first drink was at age 7, which was also the first time I ever got drunk, and then woke up the next morning with a hangover. My father had left me unsupervised during this time, and he said I could have a little, but I ended up drinking the whole bottle. I never touched alcohol again for years.

When I was in middle school, I was reintroduced with it. I think I was around 13, almost turning 14 the next time I got into it again. I'd also tried smoking weed for the first time, courtesy of my father. He allowed me, my mom was weary but ultimately she couldn't do anything about it. I remembering starting it, and progressively craving it as a way to deal with a recent heartbreak I'd gone through. The depression was too much to bare, and alcohol was the solution in my young eyes. 

In grade 9, I remember messing around with it a bit more. I would show up to school hungover from drinking on weekdays. I remember one of the days I was hungover, I had a music test first period, where I would play a piece on my violin in front of the class. I was passionate about music, but dear god, it's an understatement to say that morning I certainly wasn't.

It got very bad when I turned 15, March 2020. My father started drinking a lot more to deal with the boredom of the pandemic, he even started working at the beer store. I got hooked. This is when my alcoholism started, even though back then I wouldn't admit it. I'd wake up some mornings hungover, and my loving mom being concerned and taking care of me. Bless her heart for putting up with the bullshit.

Since then, I've been hooked. It's been over a year now, and gradually I've had to stop. In January and February I made a small (but difficult nonetheless) effort to cut down. I think it really hit me the morning I'd realized that I had 7 beers the night before, all tall-boy cans might I add. And I had to go to school. My mom was fairly patient, but lost it a little. I really couldn't blame her. I saw the disappointment in her eyes and felt it run throughout my body. It hit me. The small and subtle changes were there. I at least cared. 

February was the worst month this year for me. Drama with my boyfriend over my past mistakes, many of which I'd made while being under the influence. The guilt took over me and I'd even thought of harming myself, but I didn't. March was better, but left more to be desired.

In April I realized I'd developed OCD, which took up most of my time, because of the constant anxiety I felt because of it. It was two months later that I finally decided to reach out and get the help that I desperately needed. And it happened.

I started taking anti-depressants around a month ago, lexapro to be exact. And this is where the alcohol comes in. Like I'd done in middle school to deal with my heartbreak, I'd turned to abusing alcohol to deal with my crippling anxiety. And on lexapro, you can only have one beer a day.

I have to admit, sometimes I cheat. I've had two or three despite knowing it could worsen my symptoms and potentially give me liver failure. But to an alcoholic, was does that matter, right? As long as i had my beer.

But I know I have to stop. It will kill me if I don't. I want a future, as my mom once said amidst my hangover, ""you have so much potential."" And I could tell she was implying that i was ruining it, slowly but surely, day by day. And she was right. I have potential and I'm ruining it. I'm 16 years old, my whole life ahead of me. I have to take control and responsibility now. Or I'll never be able to get the chance to.

2021-07-06 23:45:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ofb2jr/my_abusive_alcoholic_mother/,my abusive alcoholic mother,"I haven’t had a healthy relationship with my mother since I was 9 years old. She has become a manipulative alcoholic and has no hobbies and a gambling addiction. I could never relate to her even when I was living with her growing up, she’d always take me along with her to the pub when I was younger till 3 am frequently, and I would have to be the one mothering her when she’s a drunken mess. We only bonded when I would drink with her in and out of the house which I no longer do and since she is emotionally abusive and manipulative, I moved out around 15 years old but still regularly went out to drink with her to stay in contact with her, we rarely see each other if she isn’t drinking or we aren’t drinking, and those times are usually short lived because she HAS to drink with her only friends that are 100% she has met from the pub and no offence are what are considered “wasters” who live in the pub, are mostly a lot older than her and do not benefit her except the platonic friendship and someone to talk to I guess, even though I had been by her side she prefers and spends most of her time around them, and I rarely get alone time with her so I would have to be around them at the pub to see her.

She has had unfortunate relationships since she was divorced with my dad when I was 9 and recently just ruined a relationship she had with the first boyfriend she had that we got along with that was genuinely good for her and she was happy in, they both drank too much unfortunately and that turned into arguments and they broke up time and time again. She seems to also have mental health problems but this hasn’t been confirmed since she recieved a letter maybe 10 years ago from her family concerned about her drastic change of personality and expressing they think she’s bipolar. She since burned the letter and contact with her entire family and says “I’m not crazy” and doesn’t think she needs mental health help or help with her drinking. They broke up this year over the last drunken argument resulting in her throwing things at him and yelling nasty stuff to him as usual, except this time it was infront of his children who have previously been unable to stay at her house requested by their mother (her boyfriend at the time ex wife) since there has been countless times they drink too much then argue and fight resulting in her kicking him out and him having to wake his young children up at 3 am to take to their mums house since he lives with her but has nowhere to stay and no job so he had to sleep at a friends house or his work before she made him quit. He refuses to tell me all the details about what she had to him physically and the last time she hit him with a metal crutch over his head infront of his 6 and 12 year old daughters which have traumatised them and affect them to this day where they are scared to go outside just in case they see her. He did not press charges any of these times.

One of the many reasons I think she is mentally ill is the way her personality changes alot more drastically after drinking too much is the way she becomes overly aggressive and paranoid. Everytime she drunkenly lashed out at him she would randomly be “afraid for her life” even though the 5 years, most of it I was living with them for and they would argue and fight most at home, he has never laid a hand on her. She would lock the door and call the police on him so many times thinking he was out to get her and kill her. She once drunkenly fell back when he had to lightly push her away after warning her if she punched him in the face one more time he would have to push her away, she dramatically fell to the ground and wet herself, scared for her life. She would sleep with a knife in the bedside drawe “just in case.”

She was also so nasty to me growing up when she drank, yelling the worst possible things to me. Although she never laid a hand on me I’d rather get drunkenly slapped than scarred by things a child should never hear from their mother. Occasionally she would make me feel guilty and feel the need to look after her seeing she had no real friends and I felt like it was my job as her daughter to look after her. I remember her waking me up at 4 am when I was 11-13 years old and telling me if it wasn’t for me and my brother she would have killed herself. She has also drunkenly hung from windows threatening to kill herself.

She also says nasty things about my father that’s not true, when she’s drunk and mad she would tell me things my grandmother hasn’t said according to my sober stable dad about how I need help and constantly projected on me through my whole life. She would keep me as a guilt doll and tell me how my father is evil since I was 9, telling me I’m just like him when she’s mad and I would do anything in my power for her to like me, I looked up to her, I saw we were similar and bonded through drink and felt sorry for her because I could easily put myself in her shoes and see myself in her or like her when I’m older. I then would cope with my problems the way she did by excessively drinking underage. She has put me in so many dangerous situations because she wasn’t sober enough to look after me, not only being molested at 12 in a bar when she watched multiple times but at 14 years old she invited some Facebook friend to a New Year’s Eve party, which they turned up with friends we never met that would later molest me that night when she left her two children (including me) home alone with a man she just met to go drink with the other two out of the three and play pool at the pub all night! When she came home I was upstairs trying to avoid the man that kept going into my room, she was strangled while they tried to kill her downstairs yelling call 999! They stole the booze and ran outside and punched her to the floor and said they would burn the house down! They came back and stabbed her tires multiple times to the point where we had to move out of my childhood home. I had to be a witness to the crime in court and turns out the man was a convicted felon that’s stabbed multiple people and dragged his pregnant wife across a floor! Lovely.

Since then I moved out but she always made me feel bad for not seeing her and made it out that I don’t want to and would manipulate me into going out drinking when I don’t want to with her friends that use her for money. I would justify going mostly the past years because her ex bf was almost like a father figure to me and went through the same shit I had to so we related and it was nice having another sane person experience the same shit with at the same time so I felt like I had a witness and wasn’t alone and not crazy! 

She has been gambling her money away since and spends it on drink or holidays, gambles more than she can afford or even wins back and is in denial that it isn’t working.

She has also joined a cult like group called Q-anon that has warped her reality more and now she thinks everyone is dead or fake (eg the queen and politicians) and thinks the law doesn’t apply because the government is dead and so she hasn’t been paying her mortgage properly for years because of gambling, but now completely stopped after this cult stuff and now is getting her house repossessed and although she has seen the letters is in denial that it is happening because of her new beliefs! She is an anti masker with her priorities backwards. She has to drink everyday, she has to meet a friend at the pub almost everyday and she can’t not be in a relationship! She won’t get help because she doesn’t think she needs it! 

I have been working on myself and have since stopped drinking to cope with things and have gained toxic traits by being around her and exposed to evil. It’s really important that the abused doesn’t become the abuser and I’m reminded when i have mood swings or act obscene by my dad saying “you’re acting like your mother”… I feel so guilty because I have made efforts to see her since for example going to the fair with her but she cancelled 3 times and ditched our plans because she HAD to go to the pub because she hasn’t seen one of her many “friends” for a while! 

She has never apologised to me, when she would act crazy the next morning sober she would act like absolutely nothing happened, she would burst in rage if you said anything she didn’t like so everyone around her has to walk on eggshells and all of her conversations are about her, her work or her gambling or cult ideas. She barely listens to anything I have to say. I’m no longer breaking my boundaries or making myself uncomfortable by being in these situations when I don’t have to just to see her! She has to make an effort too. I considered cutting her off completely but I feel guilty and I don’t want her to crash and burn anymore as she has been going rapidly downhill in all departments since. But I can’t look after her or help her if she doesn’t take the help. Her ex also told me that I have to be there for her! I can’t do anymore! That’s part of the reason I moved out! And when I was week on week off with my parents growing up I felt like I was going insane from a normal life to drama and drunkenness everytime and my dad would tell me I would be acting like her at the start of the week going to his from hers! I am struggling with mental health partially because of the trauma from all this which I am now finally getting the help for. She has never admit to being wrong and always has to be in the right, she doesn’t take no for an answer and would rather drink her problems away and hold a grudge on everyone for years, she would bring up things people including me have done from 10+ years ago! I make the effort but see none back. Before I used to be hopeful like her ex boyfriend hoping she would go back to how she was before or cut down drinking, but she won’t and Is getting worse and that hope is still there in the back of my head however the evidence shows otherwise and I’m having to accept my mother’s demise, I’m just upset that she has to hit rock bottom to hopefully open her eyes. I don’t want to watch her burn. 

So for now unless she reaches out or makes an effort I will not be seeing her in person anymore. She pressures me into things I don’t want to do and won’t even acknowledge the things she has put me through  and anyone else, no wonder she can’t even keep her pub friends around for long! She doesn’t have many “friends” anymore. My brother is legally not supposed to see her because of this and chooses not to unless for his birthday or short occasions…. I just don’t want to see what’s happening because I know she isn’t a bad person she makes bad decisions and is ill and a addict and needs help! Mental health and alcohol do not mix well.

(Btw the crutch story was because she broke her leg falling over drunk on the road this year! Embarrassing!) 

Edit: she also told her mum she wouldn’t give her a kidney even if she was dying, she died of kidney failure, she turned up to the funeral she wasn’t invited to to slip a apology letter in the coffin…  
also I’m aware Qanon isn’t a cult but it has completely taken over her life and is ruining it in consequences, you are allowed to believe what you want but she’s forcing her opinions on everyone else and won’t consider anything else to be true if they aren’t in that group, it’s also affecting her life in every aspect and she also refuses to wear a mask in public and will protest and spend money to plaster her ideas all over the place and protest against innocent people following rules. She will belittle anyone who believes any different.

Thankyou for reading,
Please let me know your thoughts.
I am 19 now and this still affects me, she still try’s to coerce me to drink with her if I want to see her, we usually have minimal contact over text",2,{'mask': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983408451080322}"

In my twenties, we would go out drinking at the bars/clubs but it was never this bad currently as I drink with him. I believe in my twenties, I knew my surroundings and the possibility of getting arrested for public intoxication.

Now I am thirties, I met a friend who likes drinking to the point he drinks everyday (besides 3 days of the week.) When he drinks it usually starts in the morning, and when he wants to hang out I know where it going to end.  When we hang out its binge drinking, he make me a shot or make me a drink and it becomes excessive. When I get drunk, I noticed I start to take off clothes and at first he thought it was hilarious and next day he was like ""oh now i know how you are when you are drunk"" type of situation. 

When he gets drunk he get piss drunk and piss his pants and wants to wrestle but the more we drink he noticed that is my down fall (the nudity) and I think he gets annoyed. But the next week, he will ask me again and I will say no than he begs than I strip and he gets annoyed. He don't understand why i strip but than I don't understand why he piss his pants so it like those situation. 

Now I don't know if he likes seen me naked that is why he continues or he don't have a drinking buddy that will drink on his level. No matter if I say NO or threatens him I will get naked he still want someone to drink with him.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9915137887001038}"

I was introduced to alcohol at age 13 by my alcoholic father as a coping mechanism to deal with the murder of my mom. From there, it evolved into a social lubricant to a form of celebration to a way to handle stress and now it's just a way of life. 

I'm in my mid 30s now it's really starting to take a toll on my physical and mental health. I notice I don't remember things as easily as I used to, I'm hungover constantly, sore from the inflammation, I've gained 100lbs since I was 18, and I'm super depressed. 

I want so badly to stop drinking, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I've been drinking so much I will throw up, wake up extremely hungover, and no matter how badly I feel or how many times I tell myself I'm not going to drink tonight, the cycle repeats itself. 

For those that have successfully stopped drinking - How did you do it? I live alone so I have no one to hold me accountable other than myself and clearly I'm not enough. Did anyone try medication from the doctor? Also wondering how to deal with the anxiety and edginess when I'm not drinking? Any advice would be appreciated.

2021-07-06 19:53:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/of77ev/how_bad_is_routine_binge_drinking/,How bad is routine binge drinking?,"I've been drinking since 18 and am 32 now.  From 18 - 27 or so (during my college) years I would drink to get buzzed/drunk once a week on weekends while hanging out with friends from school.  Typical college behavior.  After graduating, I continued having drinks on weekends (between 6 - 10) beers to relax, play some video games, watch movies, or hang out with friends.

In the last 4 years I cut down to drinking to twice a month, mostly on Friday evenings.  6 - 8 beers over 5 hours.

I always assumed that this type of drinking was tolerable from a health and societal standpoint, but doing more research shows that binge drinking is anything over 4 drinks in a session.  Binge drinking seems to be associated with brain damage from excess glutamate, so I'm wondering just how bad this type of drinking is for you.

I can't tell at this point if my drinking is problematic or not.  Some points:

- I only ever drink one day a week, on weekends
- This drinking pattern has always been consistent (never gotten better or worse)
- I enjoy the taste of beer and the feeling of being intoxicated.  I feel more carefree and makes activities seem more fun (movies/games/social outings)
- I deal with anxiety/depression on and off. Alcohol helps with both of those things temporarily
- I don't get alcohol cravings throughout the week but I look forward to unwinding with drinks on the weekend
- Liver enzymes are fine whenever I've had a routine blood test
- I do get mild hangovers (headaches, dehydration, fatigue)
- Drinking has never affected my performance at work.  I don't get violent, have never driven drunk, been arrested, gotten into any fights, etc.  I'm a happy/chill drunk.
- I feel that I could stop drinking if necessary for my health's sake, but I do quite enjoy it

There are some red flags in the points I mention above but I never thought any of it to be a concern.  My main concern now is causing brain damage over the long-term.  I don't believe I've experienced any noticeable degradation but this is hard to assess. 

Just hoping to get your take on this.  Am I considered an alcoholic at this point?  Am I doing noticeable, long-term damage with my drinking?

About three weeks ago something snapped inside of me - I'd had enough, and I decided it was time to seek help. I reached out to a local rehab center to get enrolled in their Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). Within a few days of reaching out I had a 1.5 hour level-of-care call with one of their psychiatrists, gave them my insurance info, filled out a ton of paperwork, and was told I'd be able to start immediately.

That was 19 days ago, and I've lost my enthusiasm. I'm still sober, and have even started seeing a therapist once a week to help work through the trauma that I believe is the source of my addiction. But due to administrative delays I still don't know when I can join group sessions, or even how much it will cost me. I thought I'd be well into my second week of the 12-week program by now.

What's worse is that I really, really hate the idea of group sessions. Reaching out to get the ball rolling on this was a big move for me - it took a lot of courage to step so far outside of my comfort zone - but now I'm doubting if it's the right path forward for me. I feel like as long as I can get at the root of my addiction with my therapist and conjure up some more healthy coping mechanisms, I can beat this. I'm almost 3 weeks sober now, and I'm feeling great!

First of all, I'm sorry for the throwaway; this is rather personal, so I wanted it separate from my main.

I'm 22. My father is 63 and he's been drinking for longer than I've been alive.

He's past the point of hiding it now-- we can all see the cases of Busch in the garage and the way he sneak it into the house when he thinks nobody is watching. Plus his hands shake, badly, and they have been for the last five years, at least. He lost his job last year when the pandemic started and hasn't been able to secure a new one, which I'm sure has made things exponentially more difficult in terms of trying to cut back. He's home alone all day while my mom and I are at work, with only the dog for company. He keeps busy by working outside and doing housework and preparing meals for my mom and me.

He's certainly got a temper, but he's never been violent or cruel, and is one of the funniest, gentlest, kindest, most selfless people you'll ever meet.

My mom has been trying to talk to him about cutting back for forever; he says the same thing every time: ""Alright."" ""I know."" ""I've been cutting back."" ""I will."" While she's used to it, she's also fed up, as their only income now is her (very low) salary and the money she received from her mother when she died, which is basically their only chance at retiring even semi-comfortably. Yet he spends hundreds of dollars on beer per month, which as you can imagine is only making the financial situation even more difficult.

I tried talking to him about his drinking a few weeks ago, after I saw him sneak beer into the garage just moments after my mom left to go shopping. I'll admit I was angry. I asked him if he really waited until mom left to buy beer, and if his doctor knew how much he really drank. He said yes, of course, and so I asked if he knew why his hands are always shaking. He was calm, said ""I'm not dumb, I know why."" I told him I was worried about how much he drank, and he said he appreciated the concern, but that I have nothing to worry about; that he ""knows things are coming to a head"" and he ""has to make a decision soon"" and that he is doing his best to cut back. This is always how these conversations go, if he doesn't get frustrated and remove himself from the situation, which is why it's been an elephant in the room for so long.

I know this is a novel, but I just need some advice. After decades of drinking daily, how do I help him see that he needs help? I feel so useless. I majored in psychology and I intend to start graduate school to go into mental health/addiction counseling soon-- and this situation is making me feel so stupid and unsure of what I know. I know about how alcoholism works in terms of psychology and biology, but when it comes to my own father, I'm at a loss. He isn't someone who asks for help when he needs it, and he avoids real conversations like the plague. So how do I even approach this? I know I can't just fix this: change has to stem from himself, and a single conversation with any of us isn't going to make him stop drinking. But what else can I do?

I don't know. His father died young, when my dad was 17, of cancer; he was also an alcoholic. I know that losing his dad at such a young age scarred him. And now I can't stop thinking about how the same is probably going to happen again-- how he's going to die from this, right in front of me, and I'll have done nothing to even try and help him. What if it's too late for him to get better? What if he doesn't even want to try?

So...it is with a heavy, shameful and slightly drunk heart that I type this.

I convince myself I'm not an alcoholic. Constantly. Every beer, every shot, but today I come clean.

I'm no longer drinking a beer at night to rewind for a bit. I'm no longer enjoying a beer as I watch some stupid fuckin TV show. 

I'm chasing that bastard down, hunting for the buzz. The great realization came today as I chugged a beer and thought of a friend's words (who's also an alcoholic to be honest): ""I chase the first 2 down, maybe the first 3; when I feel the buzz, I can relax with the fourth or the fifth"". This is starting to sound like me, man, and I don't like it, but it made me realize that yes, perhaps I do have a problem. Fuckin alcohol.

I'm not gonna bother you all with why I drink or for how many years. I have a question. If I, for example, drink 12 beers every night, is it safe to switch them for 12 light beers? How long until I reduce it, and for how long should I drink said 12 light beers before reducing it by 1 or by 2? And how long should I stick to this routine before reaching my goal: 0 units of alcohol?

I’ve been a huge binge drinker for about 10 years now. I have no ability to moderate my drinking so when I do drink I blackout roughly 90 percent of the time. I usually drink about 2-4 nights a week, and can drink anywhere from 10-15 vodkas in a night and have easily gone on full week binders. I’ve had two situations that I think would be considered “rock bottom” or at least enough to warrant abstinence. The first being a suicide attempt at 25 with my car. I didn’t drink for 9 months after and then slowly but surely began the same pattern. Starting drinking a little and was able to moderate, then within a month, I lost the ability to moderate and started binging again. 

Fast forward to this February. I’m 30 years old now and get the bad news that I contracted HIV from a drunken one night stand two months prior. In that moment my whole world changed and I was terrified. Fortunately it’s not nearly as scary as I thought and I’m currently on meds and am doing fine in that regard. It’s actually more manageable than diabetes, but it’s obvious that alcohol has been hugely detrimental to my life. 

Anyway, as of today It’s been one week since i had any alcohol or cigarettes, and I’m experiencing some anhedonia. I accepted that I’ll never have alcohol ever again, and am motivated to not drink, but I’m trying to figure out how to deal with this emotional blunting. I can’t remember the last time I had a genuine sober laugh, and I’m just ready to have my old sober self back. I know experiences are different for everyone, but how long do the symptoms of anhedonia last? Any advice on anhedonia in general?",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974601864814758}"

Yeah, it feels like she's being controlling and that makes me angry. I'm an adult who should do what I want, especially if I'm functioning, but honestly she's right. My anxiety, health, finances, motivation, sex drive... everything is falling into the toilet lately and here on day 2 of no alcohol, my mind already feels sharper, I have more energy, my acid reflux/GERD issues aren't as severe s usual and I can even breathe better. 

I think she's right. I think I have to save my marriage and just stop drinking completely. I kept telling myself, and her, that I can easily go back to drinking like a regular person... a few here and there... but I fail at that and it's happened so many times she no longer believes or trusts anything I say. I no longer trust myself.

Really like this space as a sounding board. Been in my own head about drinking lately, but not sure if I have a real alcohol problem, or if I just have some really bad habits. However, I am starting to suspect that maybe I need to start taking a more serious look at these ""habits"".

I'm unable to think of a single day in the past several months that I haven't had something to drink. Normally, it's a few beers starting around 2:00-3:00 (I work from home). Then, I'll do a good job of hydrating before bed. But, sometimes those 2 or 3 beers turns into 6-7 beers. And sometimes that turns into a couple of pours of bourbon.

I don't get blackout or sloppy drunk, but will occasionally do stupid things that are outside of my normal character. Nothing terrible, but stupid, passive aggressive B.S.... Occasionally, I can also get argumentative and become a bit of an ass. Not often, but it has happened.

I really enjoy beer and the only time I've ever laid off of booze was when I was diagnosed with gout last year. I avoided it like the plague and, aside from the gout, started to feel pretty decent. I was actually impressed with myself, lost about 10 pounds, and then was prescribed medicine to deal with the gout. In my mind, it was the magic pill that let me enjoy beer again and I've been drinking daily ever since.

Yesterday/last night was one of those that got away from me... started at a brewery with the family, but when we got home, I had another 4-5 beers or so. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like an idiot. Am I an alcoholic?

I've talked about ""cutting back"" and ""no drinking Mon-Fri"", but it's been all talk. I've never made a concerted effort to REALLY stop, but I \*think\* I can do it. Having this sub and the support in it is nice, but at what point should I possibly look into getting professional help? How would I determine if professional help is needed/necessary? Do you think I can enjoy a more reasonable amount of alcohol, or should I try to give it up completely?

Reached its peak about a 1 1/2 years ago where I was drinking a pint or more of vodka almost every day. Since then I’ve tapered off to maybe 4-8 oz and only in the evenings.

I used to get hangovers that would leave me bed-ridden shaking and sweating and puking any water I would try to get down. Then a day and a half later I would drink vodka again. Thankful I haven’t had a hangover like that in quite a while.

Past couple weeks I’ve barely had an appetite, my BM’s have been mostly yellow liquid foam. Yet I’m still drinking 4-8 oz a night. I’m also a hypochondriac so every time I google a symptom I assume the worst.

I’m not exactly sure why I’m writing this post, but I discovered this sub a few days ago and figured it might help me and maybe someone else. Life is far more important than a worry for medical bills.

Update 7/5:
 Saw the doc, was very anxious and tried spouting off as many symptoms as possible starting with the most concerning but I probably left some out. I was completely honest about my drinking habits but he seemed not too fazed about imminent danger.

I'll give some context to her alcoholism. Since her 20s my mum has always had a drink in her hand, it used to be socially but over the years it has become a serious problem. She stopped working when my brother was born in her late 20s and as we grew up and stopped needing her so much, her life became very empty and began revolving around alcohol.

Due to no responsibilities (no job, no young children) she has never had to address her drinking as an issue and as a family we always turned a blind eye to it; ""that's just mum"" etc. She's not violent at all and generally is able to hide how drunk she is (until maybe 8pm), so it was mostly overlooked. 

Over the last 10 years or so she has gotten deeper into her alcoholism. When I lived at home the drinking used to start from 4pm, then 2pm, then midday and now my father informs me she will drink straight from the bottle in the mornings (thinking he doesn't realise). She also apparently hides bottles around the house so she has access to drink if he's in the kitchen. My dad has also told me she is starting to show signs of the physical effects (constantly throwing up, nose bleeds) and fears liver problems are happening, which is very scary. 

It might be important to note my dad stopped drinking altogether around the time I was born (so 24 years ago) and I am so thankful he did. He's become such a big support to me and my new family and I can't imagine how hard home life would have been for me and my brother growing up if he was also drinking. He tried addressing her issues 2 years ago and got in touch with alcoholic family support, who told him his actions over the years define him as an ""enabler"". He tried to intervene but unfortunately his efforts didn't work. He has realised and accepted that she will keep drinking and won't stop until she wants to stop. She was also threatening to leave him when he pushed her to stop. It's incredibly sad but I think he's now accepted she's going to drink herself to death, and he'd rather spend however long she has left together. 

To bring back to the reason I'm making this post, I recently gave birth to my baby boy, he'll be 4 weeks old tomorrow 😊 My dad very sweetly hoped his arrival might spark a change in her, but unfortunately not. The other day I was at my parents house, my dad's sister came to meet my son, it was around 2pm and there was no sign of a glass in my mum's hand. She was holding my baby boy, got up to hand him to my aunt and tripped over the wheels of the pushchair (twice I might add). Thankfully he was fine. I thought it was an honest accident, but my dad was furious, obviously knowing she'd been drinking.

Since that day my dad informed me about the hiding bottles and that she's constantly drinking. I already decided I wouldn't be leaving him in her care alone, but now I feel incredibly uncomfortable letting her hold him at all. We went over to watch the England football game last night and my partner was holding him, she asked to hold him but he made an excuse. I think she knew why. She then proceeded that night to get extremely drunk. So badly I could smell it on her in the same room. We very quickly packed him up and went home when she started stroking his head and talking to him. We didn't even want her near him.

Like I say, she's not an aggressive drunk by any means, she's just a bit dazed 24/7 and makes poor decisions. This is our first child and I feel so protective. I don't know how to address this, I want my mum to be able to hold her grandson but as long as the drinking stays this heavy, I don't want her to 😢

The problem is the guilt and shame is what kept me drinking and self medicating. Does that ring a bell for you?

The best advice I can give is to find a way to release the guilt and shame regardless of the past. I know it sounds easy, but I also know it's not.

I offer up [insight on this topic](https://youtu.be/DWT52umxJFc) in one of my most recent videos and I hope you'll check it out, but if you don't please think about these possible ideas...

1) Alcoholism is passed down from generation to generation. Whether genetic or because of ancestral trauma it is NOT YOUR FAULT you struggle with alcohol abuse.

2) The past is the past. It cannot be changed. All we can do is take responsibility for our life in this moment and moving forward regardless of the past.

3) We are not weak. In fact we are very strong. Once you get sober and are able to stay sober through anything (which is 100% possible) you will prove to yourself just how strong you are. And then anything is possible.

4) It's okay to ask for help and there is no shame in admitting/naming the ""problem."" There is power and strength in owning the term ""alcoholic"" and being free of guilt and shame when stating it. It does not have to define you.

What do you think? Add to the list of ideas we can discuss or let me know your thoughts.

Usually, a binge is something like 2 beers at the bar, a shot or two of vodka/rum, and a bottle of chardonnay back at home; or 2 bottles of chardonnay; or up to half a fifth of vodka/whiskey somewhere between 2 - 4 times a week.  


The night that I drink, I'm usually out like a baby and simply wake up an hour or two before my alarm feeling not very rested and generally pretty crappy, which is about on par for alcohol. The weird thing is, I seem to be having complications going to bed the next day (24 hours after drinking). Or at least, that's the pattern that seems to be emerging.  


I started noticing an increase in heart flutterings (skipped beats, double beats, 'mini-palpitations', etc). Those are kinda freaky. I've been to the urgent and ER twice and both times, got hooked up to the EKG, got the blood work done, x-ray, all of that and came out squeaky clean. In all fairness, I had been put on heart meds long before I ever drank anything, so I can't blame it completely on alcohol. Last night (drank 2 nights ago), I got to where I would almost fall asleep, basically stop breathing, and wake up again. I repeated that over and over and over and never actually fell asleep that I'm aware of despite trying every position I could think of including trying to sleep in my chair.  


I've gotten my normal physical blood work done and all of my levels are minty. That said, I know I need to significantly cut back, if not even stop all together. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed issues like that the day after a binge and how long before things return to normal or if I should treat those as separate issues.

I think 4-6 drinks is the sweet zone for me as I can get the hard side of tipsy feeling without the hangover and productivity loss.

Unlike some here, I’m not looking to quit drinking and I don’t have any short term problems associated with it (mood swings, relationship, job, weight gain, etc). I exercise daily and eat healthily always balancing my macros and avoiding excess sugar.

However, I’m a long term thinker/planner and I know that drinking 4-6 drinks daily significantly raises the risks of liver disease, pancreatic, colon and esophageal cancer among other problems. I’m trying to find the optimal solution to the problem of being able to drink at this level and live the maximum lifespan. I’d be willing to give up perhaps 2-3 years of life expectancy to enjoy the habit but not 10 or 29 as the stats show the reduced life expectancy of the average alcoholic.

From my preliminary research, the strategies I’ve adopted are:

1. Take 2 days off per week without even a sip of alcohol to allow liver to recover

2. Take month of January off without even a sip to allow liver chance to remove long term damage and scar tissue.

3. Exercise daily with both strength training and at least 30 minutes of moderate cardio and HIIT 3 times per week.

4. Maintain BMI in 20-24 range

5. Drink 2 cups of coffee and 4 cups of green tea per day for antioxidants and inflammation

6. If I ever over-do it and binge more than 6 drinks a night, next 3 days off are mandatory with extra hydration

I see no reason I shouldn’t be able to live to late 80s or even 90s with this lifestyle, but if there’s anything else I could be doing to improve the chances, I’d love to hear other opinions. If you think I’m nuts and still bound for an early death in the 60s even with these rules, I want to hear your reasoning as well.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9797505736351013}"

Outside of my pregnancy, this is the longest I've gone without drinking in over ten years. I was a daily whiskey drinker for the last six and about nine months ago I decided to try moderation.

The last few months have been okay. I managed to get a great job, we moved to a new city, and I was starting 'fresh'. I was still 'moderating' though. My son was starting to have behavioral issues at daycare, my husband and I were still fighting a lot, and my anger was still out of control.

I had a binge episode two weeks ago and then had a mental breakdown a couple days later when I couldn't emotionally recover from the drinking. I went to a crisis center, got started in therapy, and I'm really ready now.

I've tried abstinence before but I didn't really want to quit, so I snuck drinks when my husband wasn't home and eventually convinced everyone and myself that I could make moderation work. I can't.

This time feels so different! For the first time in my life I don't WANT to drink. Drinking fuels my anger, makes me absent, and takes up so much space in my life. I'm ready to be done.

I think about it a lot. I call the thoughts my bug bites because they itch but I know that if I scratch them they'll get so much worse.

another factor that is bothering me is she is diabetic and the symptoms of her being drunk are similar to when her blood sugar is unstable. once when we thought she may have been drunk, it turned out she was an undiagnosed diabetic and nearly died due to this. she was in the hospital for a month because of it. if anything serious occurs, im planning on calling in a wellness check. for now i just don't know what to do until then and i obviously don't want it to come to that in the first place. ive done everything i can through her various relapses to help her get help (including handpicking several therapists who deal with alcoholism for her to see, which she routinely claims she is talking to yet there are no records in her email or phone) but she just won't take it. she just nods and says im right, then continues drinking.

Eventually I will add a third night of not drinking when I'm ready. I hope it works. It seems promising.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9939733147621155}"

It started it with a beer or after work to help sleep. My tolerance soon rose and I was having 5-6 years. I developed insomnia and soon I could stay up to 48 hours awake if I didn’t drink myself to sleep. Now I drink in the morning/afternoon/night. It’s funny tho cause I’m a functioning alcoholic (just recently got promoted to manager) 
When I don’t drink I get moody, start sweating a lot, not myself, and of course I can’t sleep. I’m 23 years old and I think I’m so sad to admit but I think I’m finally physically addicted to alcohol.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7853303551673889}"

He’s an alcoholic and has been sober for a year now. I’ve never been close with anyone who’s an alcoholic so I have no idea what I’m getting myself into or if there are any red flags I should look out for. I really like him so I hope things go well. He said he can be around people who drink. He’s a chef’s assistant and cooks with alcohol. I don’t drink so me having alcohol around him wouldn’t be an issue either way.,5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.998329222202301}"
