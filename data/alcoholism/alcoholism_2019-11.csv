I remember when I was young me and my mom was at my cousins wedding and she got so drunk it was embarrassing. I had to tell her only water from then on. Then there was when I found out my mom cheated on my dad with a horrible horrible person because she got black out drunk. Then there was tonight when me and my cousin were out to dinner with her and she finally told me this is NOT NORMAL. I thought it was normal, for my mom to come home in the morning. For me to put her too bed B.C. she’s too drunk to do it. To be sure she’s drinking water because there’s no way she should keep drinking. So we told her this isn’t ok, and she got really mad. She has always forever told me I should take people’s emotions as they say, that people who say there fine when there mad aren’t ok, but tonight she told us to go after and she sent me all these texts about how we made her so embarrassed and it wasn’t right to leave her there alone. I just don’t know what to do. I know this sounds bad, but give advise but not so directly? It’s just a lot right now and it’s hard to admit that this is an actual problem I have.

I went to the store a few days ago and stared at the new shipment of my favorite fix. Instead, I bought some high quality virgin drinks and was planning on drinking them after emptying my stash.

Fast forward 3 days into being clean. I get my stash ready and bring the celebration drinks.

I asked my friend (the one that started me into drinking, but now he can’t drink cuz he’s on strict probation) to come with me to support me and he said he would.

He was like “just drink it and tomorrow don’t buy more”. And I explained to him that I’m not a garbage disposal and either way the drinks will go somewhere so... and he agreed but after arguing back and forth him saying just “have 2 drinks and empty the rest blah blah.” I told him “ if I drink 2 its not enough I’ll drink 3 or all 5 of what I have.”

So we argued and I got mad and just started chugging the few shots of whiskey (usually I need a chaser idk how I did it)that was left in my bottle Then I had the 2 beers.

Then I told him he’s not my friend.

Yesterday it felt nice to feel relaxed but I was so mad at myself. Well, it’s good to know who your friends really are.

My question is, does this relapse mean I have to start over or do the 3 clean days I had count to my recovery? Does the withdrawal suffering start again from 0?",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4879946}"

However, I feel different about it, compared to some posts I saw here. The rest of sfuff I see is people being positive about leaving their alcoholic life, and helping those who struggle with it. In my case, it's quite different and I wonder whether that's just me; I started having a permanent anxiety at about 15, which after a few months turned into depression, deeper and deeper. I felt this ineluctable sense of self-harm, a desire of death. I held up to when I was 19, then I started drinking more and more heavily (I didn't drink at all, before). I read stuff like ""one more won't hurt"", while for me it's more like ""one more WILL hurt, and I need to get it"". Now I'm 22 and I'm at the point where I can't even feel the effect of 75cl of whine a day. I need at least 2 or more. Surely, I can't deny that socially it makes me feel better - and if that was the issue, then I'd only drink socially, which isn't too bad imho. But I drink every single day, because I know it hurts my body. If I don't, I start either abusing benzodiazepines or abusing my body physically; and honestly, alcohol sounds more fun than the two. I've been in psychotherapy for 8 years and I've changed my psychotherapists about 4 times and each had their own ""school of therapy""; I've changed my psychiatrists thrice, and tried different SSRIs and TCAs, but I feel no effect at all - same for psychotherapy. Actually, thinking of getting better makes me sick. I dunno if the lack of positiveness will probably result in downvotes in this subreddit, but I honestly don't care: I thank alcohol, especially when mixed with benzos, for making me feel closer to death in such an easy way - and at the same time I hate it for making me so dependent on it. In a way, I want to be fixed but I refuse it. 
So, I wonder, am I the only one here like that, or is there someone else who doesn't take alcohol as a ""cure""?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42602918}"

The issue is with my brother. He's 10 years older than me and recently turned 31. Ever since he was in high school he has heavily used drugs and alcohol, however real issues started about 7 years ago. 

I was about 14 years old, I wasnt aware that my brother had a drug problem but out of nowhere our family was informed that he was on life support for a heroin overdose (he also had a large amount of alcohol in his system) we were told he was going to die but he managed to survive. 

After he got out of the hospital he stopped doing heroin but he continued to drink. His drinking got worse and worse and he turned into a 1.75 liter a day vodka drinker. This went on for about 5 years. When he first sobered up he was told if he drank like that again he would die. 

He was sober off and on for roughly a year. Its Thanksgiving today and he has been sober for 6 months, until we got home from dinner and found him too drunk to walk or talk on the couch in the basement. 

He's getting kicked out of the house tomorrow as soon as he sobers up. But I'm in a panic because he has no money, no friends or family to turn to, a car that barely runs and it's freezing outside. It's difficult to watch your older brother that you looked up to turn into such a low life who is destroying relationships while simultaneously killing himself. 

My question is what do I do? How do i help him? Can I do anything? Should we pay for another treatment program? 

I apologize again for the length, and any poor writing (I'm posting this immediately after seeing him). I would appreciate any response. Thank you.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76226884}"

Physically, I see many improvements; mentally, the last 21 days have been a sine wave of emotion. I mourn the loss of alcohol even though it was my asshole friend who burned bridges, stole memories, nearly killed me on a few occasions. I also mourn many the days that I wasn't living, when I was living in a fog, not engaging fully as a Mother to my kids. This blurry days where I unable to do much other than pouring myself another drink to just try to make it through. 

Being sober makes the truth so much more clear and that has been utterly painful to work through. I can no longer reach for the bottle to ease and erase those truths that I have been avoiding. I am working though it and am learning to build healthy outlets - I'm running again, I'm volunteering, I'm a present Mother, I'm reading more, and am doing CBT work to help with my internal toxic voice. I am learning to find ways to face the pain and to lean into it, but Fuck it's hard.

When the tequila finished I stole a bottle of makers mark from my parents cabinet and I think I started drinking 1-3 shots of it daily till after two weeks I finished the last 4 shots all at once. Obviously I had no idea that it makes a huuuge difference how fast you drink. So I got really drunk and threw up and had a miserable miserable night and promised my self I am done.

Since around sept I’ve gone maybe 3 or 4 days without drinking. (Ok maybe 3). I told my self I don’t want to and I’ve tried to stop for two weeks some months ago but of course my friend had to persistently offer new drinks. And over the weekend I stopped for 3 days but gave up because I still had poor sleep and felt as bad as I do on drinking days (pre drinking). I thought to myself that I feel the same as before I started but why is it so difficult for me to stop ? Why do I have more anxiety and need 2 drinks in the afternoon to get through the day? I don’t binge drink and I drink a lot of water and yada yada but I just need someone to talk to about this.

Now I’ve had to increase my alcohol intake (I can still function but if I want to get REALLY drunk i can literally chug half a bottle of soju and I’m only 100lbs). I look for every excuse to drink, even if its to let loose. I told my psychiatrist this and she prescribed me seroquel so when I want to get piss drunk I can just take that but I also enjoy just being functionally drunk and the temporary happiness alcohol prescribes me. Am I considered an alcoholic now? Maybe high functioning (since I havent lost relationships and can KINDA maintain school. Only thing that is messing up with my school is my BPD episode)

In addition, I’ve been noticing some physical symptoms such as gastritis from eating food, agitation, and increased anxiety after 12-14 hrs after drinking. I tried taking my prescribed xanax, but I already took 2mg which is my max dosage. How do i deal with these withdrawal symptoms? Should i slowly ease off because my doctor said I can cut cold turkey since I have prescribed benzodiazepines that will allow me to cut cold turkey.

I recently moved to a different town after celebrating a year then a couple months later gave birth to my daughter. She is 5 months now and since she's been born I've maybe been to like 20 meetings. Because of it, my program and myself are severely suffering. Although I am working a program in other ways, praying, reading, stepwork with sponsor, my lack of meetings is causing me to feel isolated and depressed and even wanting to drink. 

I have this complex about taking her to meetings. I'm afraid she will cry or be too loud. I'm afraid others will be annoyed. I am afraid to talk before and after the meetings to ppl because of all the cigarette smoke. On top of everything, I am in a new town, away from my network. My sponsor, who is not a mom, tells me I'm using my child as  an excuse. I'll admit, there may be some validity to that. However, I'm being genuine in that I MISS meetings. I WANT to go. But I am upset that as a single, breastfeeding mother, I can't just get up and go to meetings whenever. I especially cannot go to the 830 time slot that I used to love because that is her bedtime. 

Can anyone relate? Offer some encouragement? I feel so lonely.  There is ONE mommy and me meeting that I have yet to go to so that is 100 percent my fault. It is in the morning. I am making a commitment to myself and going this week",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76220983}"

Currently breaking it as I'm writing this actually. I'm not posting this because I want to advocate for others to do the same... Just looking for anything I guess. 

Things have been bad. I've made a lot of mistakes. I'm 24 and I'm getting old and growing paralyzed... I guess I'm at the age and have enough medical knowledge of the body and the mind, of action and inaction, of cause and effect.. to realize that any action I've ever taken. Any decision I've ever made. Anything I've ever felt or thought... Is all my fault. I'm a negative person so my life has turned out negatively. I don't like who I am when I'm negative but I also don't like who I am when I'm positive. I don't fucking like myself. And it's all my fault...

My family loves me so much but it doesn't mean anything to me anymore. They can't stop the pain. They can't erase memories from my head. They can't change the way I hear things. They can't change the way I feel about things. I just want to be numb. I don't want to feel or care anymore. And I can tell I'm getting closer. I guess breaking my sobriety, for me, was just an exercise in proving that my life is my own and I can do whatever I want. I can stop drinking when I want. I can start drinking when I want. 

I don't really have any reason to feel any pain, I've just never liked myself much. I never liked myself much because it was a good way to motivate myself to try harder and to succeed. I've just never felt good enough for anyone... But I know that that's really me just not being good enough for myself. And I'm not. I'm not good enough for myself. If I was good enough then I would be able to succeed in such a way that everything I do would not result in pain. I just can't get far enough away from myself. 

Everyone close to me would always say how strong I am for being able to be sober from alcohol for 2 years... for giving up nicotine... I guess I wanted to drink again to break everyone's interpretations of me. They liked that person. Didn't mean I did. Not that version of me is gone too. Stop talking about me.  

When I'm hurt people say you need to reach out to other people.. which is what I'm doing now I guess. But I don't want that. Not ideally. Can someone teach me how to be alone and be happy? I don't want to rely on other people for help with my emotions, much like I don't want to rely on this substance for help with my emotions.

But right now... I'd rather drink and use that to help me than use other people to help me. 

Hoping to keep this failure from those who are close to me. Don't want to talk about it in therapy which is in 5 hours. 

I just want to learn to be alone... I just want the sadness and the anxiety to stop.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6281143}"

My dad drank ever since i can remember. He was a drunk/drug user when my mom decided to have a kid with him. I don't know much about my childhood with him, they separated when i was a couple years old, but i really didn't realize how bad it was until my teens. I saw him once or twice a month, and always had a ""great relationship"" with him. What i mean by ""great relationship"" is that he wasn't a violent or loud drunk, he was ""just drunk""! Never hit me, never yelled at me, tried to support me whenever he could, took me on trips and it was always an adventure, but i realized soon enough that there is not a lot of topics where i value his opinion, since he never had a successful relationship or job. I later came to realize that this is not what i would call a ""great relationship"" to have with your child, but you get my point! During my mid to late teens he was drinking 1-2 bottles of Vodka a day, sometimes sleeping on the kitchen floor in his own puke, living off social welfare and his brother who bought the house he was living in so he wasn't evicted. With ""house"" i mean more like a junkie shed. Filled with filth, trash and 100s of empty vodka bottles. Sometimes i couldn't reach him for 3-4 days, so i took public transport to go check on him. He lived about 1hr away, and most of the time i was expecting that he has died, suffocated on his own puke or something. He never did, just was too fucked up to get to his phone.

I don't really remember when this happened, it was during my mandatory military service, but one day his mother took him to a detox center, sort of a closed hospital where he got cleaned up. He spent some time there, after that relapsed, got clean again in the same detox center and this time for good. He started working again in construction as a sort of helping hand during all kinds of projects, and slowly tried to get his act together. He moved out of his brothers house, and across the country to a more rural area. He started seeing an old girlfriend of his again, they had a child together. He still is a dumbass, makes stupid decisions, has almost nothing, and struggles through live. Lived in his car for a while, but somehow always got around. He is older now, can't really do a lot of manual labor for much longer, buy and sells motorcycles besides his janitor job. The both of them are not together anymore, but he stays around, got a place to live on the same street as his kid and her, and for all i can tell, makes an effort to be a good part of her life. This is 10 years after he got clean the second time. 10 years completely clean!!!


My mother visited him about 2 months ago, they would always talk to each other from time to time, or visit. He drinks again. And my dumb ass knew it all along, but i didn't want to see it. I talked to him on the phone a while back and thought he was really tired from working, but he was fucked up. My mom visited him when she was seeing a friend in the area and talked to me about it. He wasn't ""having a drink"", he was drunk drunk.


So i am having my first kid in January, and he was very very happy when i told him. I want him to get better, and be happy, and when he can drink and not let it get out of hand it would be fine, but i just can not see how he could ever risk this. In my opinion, this is a huge risk to take and the reward is so little. Why risk it all for some booze. So i called him yesterday, after 2 months of putting it off. He contacted me for the first time in months, which was already strange because we used to talk on a regular bases and i would have though me having my first child would make him check in from time to time.


He did not deny drinking again, i asked him if he thinks this is a smart move and he said ""Yes, very!"". He said i shouldn't be worried, everything is great and relapsing it not ""like you might think""!


He might pull it off, he also might very well be laying in his own puke again in a couple months...


I will call him again this week, and ask him to make his case for drinking. What great value he sees in it that he is willing to risk it all. It just hurts to think about your father being this broken and undisciplined, and that all he thinks about is himself. Not seeing what this means for his kids. Me on one hand, but his 10 year old daughter on the other. He might even not remember how bad it was back in the day, and i will remind him of that.

I went to an AA meeting this morning and met amazing people and exchanged numbers to help me through this journey.

My alcoholic journey has kicked the shit out of me to the point where i welcomed death.  I remember attending a funeral for one of my alcoholic friends and actually feeling envious that he was finally free ... and I was’t.  But this whole new level of despondency & defeat shed more light on my relationship with alcohol.  

I started to take an honest look at my life, my behaviour, my anxiety, my failures and started to finally realize that, for the longest time, I would blame everyone and everything for my problems but never the alcohol.  As crazy as this sounds, its true.  

I was raised in a family where it was perfectly normal to drink.  Even the highschool I attended planned an “after party” on graduation to ensure students could safely drink.  University had happy hour and daily drink specials advertised all over campus.  With liquor stores on every corner and large, elaborate billboards, showing bottles of booze on every major commute to and from work,  why wouldn't I come home and pour a stiff one.  Even in my professional work environment, comments like “you deserve wine tonight”, “I need a drink, how about you?”, or “who wants to go out for drinks” were part of a typical day.  Furthermore, our social committee had asked everyone to bring in a bottle of wine and whoever’s name was drawn would take home 40 bottles.   All planning around social functions/festivities would include alcohol.  Even children’s events would include alcohol for the parents.  So the years and years of brainwashing where alcohol consumption was normal/acceptable   blinded me from seeing alcohol as the core issue/problem.  For so many years of my alcoholic life I couldn’t even see the big ass elephant in the room!  

So now I begin the journey of de-constructing the past one sober day at a time ... wish me luck ...

I've recently posted in here about my alcohol issues and have not yet been able to see my doctor.
I am just wondering if anyone here has withdrawn from alcohol via doctors recommendations that has a similar intake and body size to myself. Reason for asking is I want to stop, but safely. I cant get an appointment for 2 weeks.
I am 17st and drink 60-70 units a week.
Is anyone able to recommend a safe reduction per week whilst waiting to see my doctor?

If I halved my intake, would that be considered safe? Or do I need to taper off more slowly or can i go straight to 20 units a week?

Been drinking 40-70 a week for 10 years. Never had a time i cant remember the previous night or where I cannot function the next day. I'm good at my job as a network engineer.

Any input would be welcomed. Just bare In mind i also take 10mg citalopram for anxiety which may need to be factored in.

Thanks in advance.

I hope people like the content, but most of all I REALLY REALLY desperately hope other people who have had or currently has an alcohol or drug problem of any kind

This is kind of a poem/short story I guess It’s hard for me to get my feelings out verbally, so I wrote this to describe what really went on in the 4ish years I had a alcohol and cough pill (dextromethorphan) dependency. Not only in my mind, but how it affected more than just me and why if it weren’t for my wife and our family I’m 150% sure I’d be dead. I’m 25 years old now I was 21 when it all started.

So please PLEASE if you know anyone who has or is at the beginning of signs of dependency of ANY KIND. Have them read this or read it to them. If it saves just 1 life besides mine that’s the biggest blessing!


**All they see and hear is all the lying
They don’t see all the self hatred and the crying

But none of them realize what happens in the alcoholic mind.
Cause you see, if I had one wish.
One wish with no limits I’d rewind time
I’d go back to February 2015
I’d tell 21 year old me after that first sip
“Here’s a little tip. Stop now. You enjoyed it once, you had your fun. Trust what I say. No drugs no alcohol”

I’d teach younger Tyler. I’d tell him “you’re done.” Otherwise this autumn you’ll think you hit rock bottom. At least you THINK it’s rock bottom, and logically it is.”

I’d say “this isn’t a story, it’s a memory I have, but it’s the future YOU have. Picture this, its 11pm, you’re laying in the bath you’ve been going months secretly doing pills chasing that thrill.

No one has any idea what you’ve been doing. No one knows all the research you’ve done, all the pills you’ve taken. At first you thought you were doing it just for fun.

But this night in the tub is when you actually sit down and think about what you’ve done. You know how fucking deep you are in this. You’re way too fucking good, because no one knows something is amiss. 
As soon as those scary thoughts start rushing in your mind, your first thought is “God dammit why can’t I just rewind” but those thoughts are bad. “I thought the pills were just a fad.”

You think about your little girl. Thank the Lord you did, because THAT is what made you snap out of the thoughts in your head.
You immediately drain the tub. You go to the bedroom and see the girl you love. She HAS to know, because you know one day you want to make her your wife. You better hope you didn’t also ruin her life.

It’s not rock bottom though, cause you’ll still chase that thrill, you desperately want to stop. You hate these drugs and alcohol. You hate worrying about when you’ll get them again, but if you made a list of all the important things, why the fuck is it at the the top?! 

Again though young Tyler everyone around you doesn’t get it. “Just stop the drugs and alcohol. Stop “the fun times” you’re just hurting yourself and everyone. That’s what everyone around you says. 
Understandably they don’t get it. They just see the outside they don’t see the internal “I wish I were just dead” pit. When your body and mind force you to think it’s time to get more, they don’t see you absolutely hate yourself on the way to the store.They don’t see you throw a fit in the car that’s what the addiction will do!
You don’t know where you got all this aggression, but yup here we go into a deeper depression.
You thought this was suppose to stop after your confession! “The drugs will fix it!” You can hear your brain screaming at you “just this one last time we’ll stop after today.” You know it’s all lies, it’s just easier to tell it “yeah. Ok” cause you know if you don’t no matter how bad you want your brain to stop yelling it won’t!
They don’t see you arguing all the way to your destination. It’s time to stop. Don’t go even deeper, don’t make any thoughts worse than they already are. I wonder if I’ll feel it if I just step out in front of this car. That’ll silence it!

You now have the drugs in hand, you know what you’re doing. You can’t look at any mirrors as you’re cussing back into town. What sucks even more is no one sees that there’s nothing they can say to you that you don’t think about EVERY.....DAMN....TIME!!
Now right on queue; your mind whispers “just take it. You’ll be fine”

That’s what you think is so hard for them. They think you’re enjoying life TOO much. But this isn’t life. At least that’s what you think. But it IS life because of your baby and your wife.
I’m telling you now Tyler I keep repeating that you’d be DEAD and the only thing other people would’ve thought was “oh. He was just fucked up in the head”
Cause again that night in the tub that would’ve been it. No one would’ve had any clue about your addiction and shit.

No one will get why you do it. Everyone thinks you’re just chasing a great time, they think you’re just craving a relaxed mind.
You understand all the judgement and being looked down upon. You understand the frustration from your peers.
Unfortunately they don’t see that their concern and advice to stop is falling on deaf ears.

You see to everybody else watching an addict do their drug, they think it promotes a fun time
When everything is fine, so let’s pop some whisky and wine.
They think you go get the bottle and the pills cause it’s fun. They don’t hear the voices in your head telling you your life is done. 
But you can’t let it be done, cause all you think about is your little princess running around screaming “where is he?!” She misses daddy. She doesn’t understand
Tyler the biggest daddy’s girl no longer see her daddy anywhere on this land, and now she can’t stop crying. That image right there is FAR worse than dying.

You don’t expect them to understand. Addiction and fun to them go hand in hand. But their support is what got you through. Their support is what made you see “ok yes I’m deep in this, but it’s up to me” you’re not mad at them. Cause again their helping hand and love is what made you ready to win.

Just one more thing past Tyler. MOST the pills weren’t obtained with money. They were obtained because you’re way too good at manipulation and outsmarting. The things you did for your fix. It was mostly because your cleverness to steal. So the last advice I’ll give you is when you die and meet the Big Man, your ass better kneel!!!

So next time you think you want the drugs and the fix. Take a good look around, and smile at your family and remember; if it weren’t for them you my would be in jail or somewhere in a ditch.**

The time period between high school and when we started dating was a period we did not talk, just disconnected due to life and such. 

He has always smoked cigarettes as long as I’ve known him, and in that time period he had a year long addiction to meth, which is no longer the case. He also developed his love for drinking during that time. He also has gotten a DUI while we weren’t talking but still affected our relationship in the beginning of our relationship due to him still dealing with some of the repercussions.

At first when we started dating I definitely took notice to it, and then we moved in together in away from our home town since that’s where my job was, and it was totally fine not an issue. We would definitely discuss who was going to be a DD when we would go out or get an Uber or whatever, but sometimes he wouldn’t hold up his end of the bargain when it was his turn. 

Then we moved back to our home town at the end of June this year, where all of his friends live, and it got way worse. He would frequently drink and drive and barely ever hold up his end of the bargain, and we started fighting more about it. When he’s sober we can have a real conversation about it, but when he drinks it’s always “I’m fine” “I haven’t had that much” or other excuses or I’m the one that needs to calm down about it. He will repeatedly drink 5+ drinks in a few hours and act like he can drive.

At this point I need to make a special note that this happens maybe about once a week, sometimes 2x a week depending on our social life. That’s when it’s a problem, so it’s not as critical as some cases.

Last night he was DD and so that gave me permission to drink a little more in my mind, and by the time we were ready to go I knew he wasn’t ok to be driving. We
Have fought so much about this. I told him it didn’t matter that I got mad at him about this and I’m sick of having this conversation. And that’s when it got said out loud that I think he’s an alcoholic, and he cried and so did I. 

I have suspected it but due to in my opinion it being more mild I wasn’t sure if it was that. Last night it just really dawned on me that I know he does care, but it has to be alcoholism because despite this he still chooses to drink even with also having another DUI that could happen. It hit me that I can’t help him with this with critical conversations. We just left it at that and agreed to talk about it another day after we just let it sit.

Now what? Do I wait for him to bring it up because I don’t think he will. Do I push for treatment or therapy? I don’t know what to do but I can’t keep being the only responsible one...",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47154927}"

I had some blood work done during a routine check up. Apparently you're supposed to fast before, but I wasn't told to fast, so I ate/drank alcohol the day before, and ate breakfast. My appointment was at 730am.

I'm a 34yo male, didn't start drinking until I was 22, drank infrequently until I was about 30. The last 4 years it's been probably 2-4 drinks a night on average.

Ok basically I woke up this morning with the kind of headache I have not had in a long time.  I got sober a year and 2 months ago. Ive been drinking socially since I was 18 years old, with increasing dependency each passing year.  (I’m 34 now) The last 5 years prior to becoming sober, I became a very heavy drinker, it was so bad to the point that I couldn’t sleep through the night without waking up sweating and shaking.   

So back to the headache, in the following months of becoming sober, my body was really out of whack, as to be expected. I worked through it and kept getting better.  I guess I thought I was past the stage where my physical body finally recovered.. but as of this morning, (1 yr, 2 mth) I feel hungover, its a really bizarre felling.  Then it reminded me of some kind of information I read somewhere online about the length of physical recovery depending on the history of the individual’s abuse of alcohol.  Do I make sense? 

Just a vague recollection of reading something and a person who described his drinking habits and it was pretty much the same as mine, he said it took him three years to feeling back 100% physically.

It all started last week when I went into a spiraling depression and binge drank; the entire week. Friday hit me and everything inside of my body was expelling from me. I had no energy. 

A day later my brain is exploding, I’m hearing things, and my body and mind are not connecting. I couldn’t sleep nor eat. Found out my liver was failing. 

I immediately poured out all booze, drank a ton of water and tried to feed my liver good stuff. 

I’ve been eating healthier and drinking tons of water for two days but I think it’s too late. 

My liver has completely stopped working and has poured all of its liquid into my abdomen. My heart is racing. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow but im not sure if that’s soon enough and I’m not sure if draining my stomach is enough for me to go to emergency. It’s the liver that needs to be taken out and of course there’s a list. Will I do before it’s my turn? I’ve read that liver failure if gone untreated, can still have a life expectancy of 1-2 years. While when your abdomen fills with water you have weeks. 

I’m so scared and mad at myself for doing this to myself.  

So now I’m just laying here just wondering when I’ll die and what it’ll feel like. 

If you’re still drinking, please stop. This is the scariest feeling I have ever felt.




Update: went to urgent care this morning and they took blood tests which didn’t help me out at all. I know my liver enzymes were high. 

I go to my primary tomorrow so I’ll see what she says. 

I have an appt with a gastro doctor but it’s all the way in January. I have no idea what to do until then. I see some of you saying you were in end stages and your liver repaired itself which is giving me so much hope because I am so incredibly sad right now. But I feel like I need the gastro doctor right now. I can’t wait. Have no idea what to do.

I also wanted to mention which I should have before that I actually believe I have cirrhosis. Going to the ER, they may have drained the fluid in my abdomen but my liver is still scarred and my liver will continue to drain into my tummy.

The habits and rituals were the most difficult at first. It started with having drinks after work which morphed into early afternoon and eventually upon waking up in the morning. I found myself waiting for the opportunity to sneak off to the bar when my wife would leave for errands. When traveling I knew where every bar was and would stop for a half a dozen (or a dozen) drinks on my way. Those habits developed over years and were/are hardwired into my brain like Pavlov's bell.

The habits were hard, but that just takes persistence. For me, the hardest thing was taking responsibility for my emotions. I had used alcohol to flee and escape from my feelings, drowning them away. My wife cried every day and felt I was never present. She had enough and I sought out counseling. This was the first step towards taking ownership of my own wellbeing. I had to acknowledge that I wouldn't always feel ""ok"" and running away was not the answer. Today I still feel overwhelmed, angry, stressed, or defeated but instead of seeking the oblivion of a bottle, I soak it all in, acknowledge it, and move forward. For the first time in a long while, I am here for myself and for her.

27 year old female, I work in the alcohol industry (sales) which is where this confusion is stemming from. I don’t drink everyday of the week and I don’t feel like I crave a drink (unless it’s been an especially shit day). However, if I’m being honest I do go out every weekend and binge drink, I’ve been doing this since about 22. When I do go out I wouldn’t say I’m a problem, I genuinely believe my friends would tell me, but I don’t necessarily know when to stop. I feel like I have been flirting with black outs at a higher frequency. 

The things that are happening that have led me here are pertaining mostly to my health and mental health. I have missed days of work not because of hangovers but because of depression. I’m lethargic and feel like I’m always ready for a nap. My physical fitness has declined, but I eat fairly healthy. I do feel like I need a drink to be social, which is tough when I’m around alcohol and people all the time for work. I’d say on average I’m drinking 5-6 days a week and binge drinking about two of those days, the other days I only have two drinks or so? Nobody in my life has come out and said they think I have a problem, but I do wonder if they’re just too afraid to say so?

I guess I’m having a hard time managing my relationship with alcohol given my work environment. I don’t know how to change that without switching fields completely, and I have had a few moments in these last couple months where I have been out on my own and woken up in a terrible mental state. Mostly because I chose to black out on a Tuesday at a dive bar after a work event because I didn’t know when to stop. 

So my question here is... how do I know?

Simple caloric math of adding 7 hours of exercise per week and subtracting the calories from the 120 weekly beers does equals weight loss (although somewhat offset by increase in ice cream).

Wish I had some pictures so I could share the before and after, but I refused to have my picture taken. Heck I can’t even imagine the before and after as I also avoided mirrors for months and years.

(At least today) Being  able to look at myself, both figuratively and literally, is quite the beautiful thing.  

Hope others have (or will have) similar experiences, not so much the superficial results but the more profound ones.

I really wanna drink tonight so I'm just gonna rant on here first and see what happens. So here's so somewhat random, somewhat coherent thoughts.

I deal with depression and anxiety. I've been on Lexapro for about 6 months but my anxiety has been really bad lately. I'm just over it and don't wanna deal with it anymore. I'm more or less miserable every day lately so I feel like I may as well drink. I don't think it's going to be anything but a short-term distraction at best, but I feel like fuck it. And if the only reason I'm not is because I'm two days from 3 years. I've never done AA btw so it's not about a chip or whatever but I guess it's the same idea. I also know that my friends and family know how long I've been sober. I'm super open about it. So I also feel pressure not to for the sake of having to tell people and be judged or disappoint people. But this isn't their life, it's mine so why not just do as a please? And I know I'm *strong* enough to not drink but what if I just actually want to drink?

I guess I just can't figure out what is still keeping me from just drinking the gin I bought two days ago or going to get something else. Like I'm not even really worried about going on a bender (as in, I really doubt I will but also don't really care if I do).

Things have just been bad recently. For a couple months. I did it to myself on purpose though. I like to cause pain to myself because by experiencing pain I feel like I will get stronger. I'm a perfectionist and fear failure, so I finally tried to just set myself up to fail and hit a rock bottom so that I could understand pain and failure. And hopefully then move on from it or something. Let go of it maybe. Evolve. Get rid of the ghosts and the shadows and the echos that I see and hear everyday by finally facing them. 

My greatest accomplishments and failures have always been the result of me being upset about something. I feel like maybe I'm supposed to do this... I'm supposed to break so that I can finally learn who or what I am. 

I feel alone. I want to be alone. I don't want to be alone... I need to learn how to be alone. I want to be alone so that I'll no longer be alone. 

I've never felt strong or accomplished being sober for 2 years. People tell me it's a sign of my strength, but I've never seen it that way. It just reminds me that I can't control myself. And when I get upset or stressed it's just there... mocking me... telling me that I'm one sip away from throwing away all my progress. 

I don't care anymore. I'm just trying so hard not to care. I don't want to feel. I don't want to think. I just want to have one beer so I can throw this date away. Dates mean memories. Memories mean attachment. Attached means identity. I feel like I'm about to break... and what's worse... is I think I'm feeling excited for it...

Everyone relapses, don't they? It's like a stereotype threat almost... It feels like it. I feel threatened. I always thought  I wouldn't be someone who did... but now I want to. Just so I can say that I was wrong about who I am or was or something... I just can't get far enough away from myself anymore.

Just want to share my story. I've been drinking since I was 16, was usually the drunkest on parties, newer had a limit and always wanted to keep doing.

Fast forward 10 years, drinking became more frequent, few bears on a couple of work days, more so on weekend's. But everything escalated, one more year and I'm diagnosed with diabetes, type 2. Dropped 25kgs in a year and were basically declared free from diabetes if I eat my strict cost. If I would eat pasta though? My blood sugar peaks too crazy levels.

I ate good,lived healthy, then many family tragedies happened to close to each other, that's when I started drinking Alot every other day. This worked for a year, when I decided to get sober.worked for a few months, then I was on the booze again. But now I was drinking every day, and more and more. Everyday I came home my hands were shaking, first think after work I instantly downed 2 beers.

Started to get consecuenses, got sent to to the drunk tank after a night out, few weeks later got sent to the psychiatric pissed drunk,delusional,thought someone was in my apartment and what not. That didn't change much,I just started drinking right after release, I was there maybe one hour.

Then it escalated, like big bottle of wine on workdays,and a couple big bottle of booze on weekend's.

Have woken up drenched in piss, not really knowing what happened,woken up on grass fields thinking I was in another town,made my mom cry many times being drunk and making my fool of my self. last week's I've chugged bottle after bottle, more then usual.

What took the cake was this Monday,hade shaky hands but could manage, but while working I think I had some seizure,whole body was shaking,could barely stand barely drink water from a cup. was fucking terrified. I know you can die from quitting,so I went home and downed q few beers,felt good, but knew this is fucked. For the next to days i drank small amounts, to get it out slowely. today I woke up, shaking hands and my whole boody was trembling,could not coordinate any limps.

So.. Went to detox, afraid as fuck for my health and what's to come. Super nice doctors, instantly got a shot in the but cheek with vitamin b, blood pressure medicine (was 180/100+), and a small dose of benzo to take the worst shaking away.

Now I'm lying in bed, only small shakes on my hands, feeling Ok but pretty fucked mentally, I'm drained. I know my liver tests were bad few months ago, shitting my self for test answers that will come tomorrow. I would newer be able to ride this out myself, I have detoxed at home before, but this time nothing worked just trembling shaking anxiety and fear.

So know here I am, will soon get something to fall asleep and then be woken up in 7 hours to do more tests and to see how much the tremors are and meat and talk to doctors and some psychiatric. Scared, but feeling good and bad. I have finally realized,I will die before the age of 35 with no change,it's finally clicked, the fucked up life I have lived. I hope my liver is not completely destroyed, and that the tremors will die down, and that I for one with this appifiny, and help from addict clinic (open care) will help me change my thought process.

Even if I had ever had the courage to tell anyone that I’m an alcoholic they wouldn’t have believed me, but I very definitely am and have been since I was a teenager.

As far as appearances go, I’ve always held down an OK job, been a good father, and all the other things that some people find so easy. The reality is, however, very different. I’ve just been clever about it – good at hiding it, good at not doing anything too silly or damaging, good at holding things together, good at controlling things when the drinking begins to spiral, good at appearing sober when I’m not… I’m sure many people here will know what I mean. I’m someone people look at and admire, someone many people want to be like – no one wants to think I could be an alcoholic as it would shatter their illusion - but under the surface I’m just a mess. On the few occasions where I’ve managed to stop drinking for any length of time, my life has started to become what it could be, but quickly descends back to that base-level only just above full-blown chaos when I inevitably start drinking again.

Anyway, I suppose what I wanted to say was I’m sharing to help me remember some of the reasons why I stopped and hopefully help anyone else who can relate to this - the same way that the other stories shared here help me. For the first time I’ve stopped for the right reasons and I’m loving being sober. I stopped smoking 15 years ago and now have no desire whatsoever for a cigarette and I know that one day I’ll feel like that about alcohol.

Thank you to everyone who shares their stories here and offers support. It’s vital to never got complacent.

We have also reached out to our local rescue mission that has a sobriety program to help people sober up but we haven’t heard anything back from them.

Some periods of my life it's only been the occasional drink, other times it's been quite excessive. I've dabbled in other substances as well, mainly when I was drunk. However, I decided to quit those all together two years ago, and I've been successful at that so far. Yesterday I was out with some friends, and I was incredibly close to doing cocaine. I tried a small dab on my gums just to remember the taste of it, and thankfully I realized that it was a super bad idea, and I didn't end up snorting any. I remember I was standing there, watching this girl and one of my friends do a line, and I felt disgusted. Today I woke up feeling quite anxious and depressed. I've been thinking that it's not worth it for me to drink. I don't know if I'm alcoholic, but that's irrelevant anyway. What's most important is that alcohol has been creating more negative experiences than positive experiences for me for quite some time now.

I'm just really, really afraid to quit.

In my country it's a big part of our culture to get wasted. Everyone I know drinks. I know that some of my good friends wouldn't mind if I didn't drink, but it's hard for me to cope with the rest. I've just started my master's, and a big part of getting to know all the new people and make friends has been to go out and have drinks with them. I have a party coming up with my class as well, and I would feel super weird going there and just not drinking at all. 

If I really wanted to quit, it wouldn't be an issue, I guess. And I sort of do want to, because I'm at a point in my life where I want to focus on other things like my classes, feeling better mentally and stuff like that. I just don't know where to start.

He's also been getting into smoking weed and makes jokey comments about selling his manga to buy coke. I feel seriously worried about the path he's starting to head down by using alcohol, weed and in the past self-harm to escape the stresses of high school life.

I very much want to raise concerns with a teacher or his parents, but I know I will jeopardize my friendship with him by doing so. School offers support but from my experience and that of others, it is intrusive and never helps to solve the problem. I'm not sure how his parents would react, they're very loving and caring, but I don't know if they would know how to respond. I've also only seen him drink at school on one day and most of the information gathered has been from his and my other friends. He has overcome the self-harm but I don't know if he will be able to overcome this.

The past year or so he has taken up drinking to cope with depression. Something horrible and traumatic happened to us (which eroded my trust in him) a little over a year ago, shortly after that was when he started drinking. We are both from alcoholic parents. My father who I’m basically estranged from is an alcoholic, and his mother who passed away when he was a young teenager was an alcoholic and heroin addict. He had a  awful childhood due to his mother’s addictions and his father just being an all around piece of shit. After the traumatic event last year he also disclosed that he had been sexually abused by his step brother when he was a child. All of this had quickly lead to a drinking problem. It’s been really hard and surprising because we weren’t drinkers, not even casually, cannabis has long been our choice to relax and unwind. He acknowledges that the drinking is a problem, when he’s sober, but always denies that he’s been drinking when I ask, and he always hides that he’s drinking. He also usually says the bottle is old when I find one of his empties. I’ve tried to do mental gymnastics to believe him when he lies, I want so desperately for him to be truthful, but this has left me with serious trust issues. I feel serious guilty not trusting him, and my constant questioning leaves him agitated that I’m so distrustful. When he drinks he’s totally different, he’s mean and abrasive. He’s picked me up from work intoxicated (wearing 2 different shoes), road raged with someone so bad that I thought we were going to get into a deadly car accident a few different times. He’s just completely forgotten to pick me up from work and not answered his phone, and when I’ve finally made it home he’s been completely passed out on the couch, this has happened a few times. He’s named-called me and just been totally cruel at times, and also embarrassed me at family functions. He even pissed himself when he was passed out, and thrown up in the middle of the floor without remembering doing it. Because of all of this I’m not able to be okay with any level of drinking on his part. When he does open up and talk about it, he tells me he’s out of the worst of his depression, and I will admit that his drinking hasn’t been as bad the past few weeks as it was in the past, but I believe it’s a slippery slope that will most certainly get worse, especially because he has a very addictive personality and rationalizes his bad behavior to himself. I know I’m far from perfect, and that my behavior has definitely contributed to any relationship problems we’ve had, but I’m just so hurt that he continues to do this to us. He’s promised he many times that he would stop drinking. It just feels manipulative and like he’s taking advantage of the trust I do have for him. He swears that this isn’t the case, but I feel like I can’t tell when he’s telling the truth. I’m heartbroken that I can’t trust the person who I love the most. I feel so helpless. I’m completely traumatized by all of this. I have nightmares and horrible flashbacks and panic attacks. I probably would have left by now, at least for a break, but I have no where to go. I definitely can’t afford to live on my own, or take care of our dogs by myself. I feel completely alone, I don’t have any close friends or family to confide in because I don’t want anyone to view him any differently. I’ve been trying to push to get us both into therapy and couples counseling, but it’s been difficult to find something that’s affordable, will see us often enough and return our calls. I found a mostly empty bottle in our bathroom last night and I stayed up almost all night going between feeling numb and crying. Neither of us have used the word “alcoholic”, as he doesn’t seem to have a physical addiction to alcohol, but I would consider him an alcoholic. I love him so much and really do want to spend my life with him, but I can’t commit to living with a partner who’s an addict. I hate how selfish he’s become. I don’t want to be doomed to live the life that my mom lived during my childhood being married to my alcoholic father. This is taking a serious toll on my mental and physical health. I’ve needed to get this off my chest, any advice is much welcomed. I’d like to get into a support group for spouses or partners of addicts.

He's sober only if he's at work or going to work (They test them) other than that he's always at least a little tipsy from 3 beers or some spirit.

Every time he drinks he turns into a total mad choleric, without reasoning. Verbal abuse, Nasty arguments even with children. But when he's sober he's a pretty normal guy. Hot-tempered but overall just a normal funny guy. I just recently started to successfully recover from all the emotional trauma as I left home at 19, but what saddens me that the situation back at my parent's house hasn't changed, maybe even got worse.
 
He doesn't get physically aggressive but the verbal abuse is just enough - and it is happening multiple times a week. There's still my mother and younger sister living with him. My mom only steps up if he gets extremely abusive (When someone tries to reasonably argue with him it gets even worse). But my younger sister(18) is what I am so scared about, she's a total ball of nerves - she has a tick in her eyes, bites her nails, freezes whenever someone raises voice..
My dad never admitted he has an issue, and since he's drunk all the time if he's not at work - even mentioning that he might have problems just starts another nasty argument. (I tried it while I was still living at home) My sister is so emotionally weak she's unable to fight anymore and my mother is weak, does not really want to leave (as she still loves him somehow) and even if she did she would end up with no money or place to live.

I’m the child of an alcoholic and I should have recognized that this is a disease. I’m not sure how to start this process but I want to start. I don’t know much other than today I choose not to drink. I hope to make the same choice for tomorrow but I’ll just focus on today. I am not sure if I should join AA but I’m willing to do that. I just came here hoping to get some advice and for someone to understand that I’m truly not a monster. Alcohol has ruined my life in so many ways. If you have any advice or words to share I’d greatly appreciate it. I’m very tearful as I write this but I realize that I’ve really made choices bc of alcohol. I’m hoping that I can make a big change to my life. I am starting here.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75154203}"

Drink up, baby, stay up all night

With the things you could do, you won't but you might

The potential you'll be that you'll never see

The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now and forget all about

The pressure of days, do what I say

And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore

That push and shove and won't bend to your will

I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars

I'll kiss you again, between the bars

Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air

Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up…",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5677646}"

Over the past year and a half, we've taken steps regarding our relationship with alcohol.

I \[F33\] knew he \[41M\] was drinking vodka here and there. Honestly, we've been so happy and I haven't seen him in a drunken state. I understand the magnitude of this issue. Maybe he feels the need to supplement, it's unhealthy to go cold turkey, so I kind of let it go. But, one day I asked. And he lied. I've caught him lying before about vodka. The drinking wasn't effecting our relationship. The lying was. Then I found a secret stash of pot. Ok-whatever he probably forgot about it. I was so pissed about the lying about liquor (again) I didn't care about that. After four days of not talking, I went to a hotel. But, then the pot stash was gone. It was in his stuff, it was there and then it wasn't.

Finally, we talked about things. He came clean. He said he lied about drinking because he was ashamed that he can't control it. He cried and I held him. I told him that I love him. I love him very very much.

Eventually, I had to ask about the pot. That made no sense, why would he hide pot- we smoke pot together! He doesn't remember. Wait, so you had this pot stash, then based on when I saw it and when I saw it was gone, you retrieved it on Thursday or Friday. And you have no memory of doing so? He said he didn't even drink on those days.

He says he's scared about the fact that he doesn't remember. It's bothering him that he has no memory of it.

I'm so torn because I love him and I accept him, and I forgive him for lying about alcohol and I want to move forward from this. But, I recall another time I asked if he was drinking and he told me (regarding wobbling, stumbling), I'm not drinking, I'm actually worried about my health. Something is wrong with me.

That's where we are. He just came clean about drinking. We need to heal and he needs help and I want to support him. I asked him if he believes that I will stand by his side through thick and thin as long as he's honest. Yes. Do you believe that I will leave if you're lying to me? Yes. He still doesn't remember having the pot or retrieving it.

Is this something that happens? Memory loss while you're sober? I feel like when he admitted to drinking being something he can't control, it was a big moment and that moment is unfairly in the shadow of this other issue.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4798226}"

Drinking turned my world of grey into a beautiful, enjoyable existence for just a little bit.  I started drinking heavily after a severe breakup, because I couldn't bare the pain of living without her. It was my escape from facing those ever so memorable emotions I encountered before meeting her. But she turned into my escape, she gave my life meaning.  So when she left, I was forced to face my own demons again. I couldn't handle them, so I turned to alcohol. I would drink every day of the week, blacking out at least 4 times per week for about 4 years.  
 I eventually started to feel the cognitive effects this had on my body, heavily impacting my job, so I stopped for 3 days. Overcome with crippling anxiety on the first two days, I thought I only had to deal with this for a little bit longer. On the third day, I had a seizure due to alcohol withdrawal. Nothing is scarier than waking up in an ambulance having no recollection of what had just occurred. I sat in the hospital for four days. I only have a very foggy memory of this, but what stuck out to me most was the overwhelming thought of suicide because I will forever have to deal with depression. Never in my life have I been closer to actually going through with it than those following months.   
As I sit here now, contemplating my life, it dawned upon me. I drank because of depression, and I am depressed because all that I do is work and spend my free time wasting it. Drinking made my miserable life enjoyable, but my life is only miserable because I do nothing, It's a vicious cycle.   


I will give myself one year as of today  to step out of my comfort zone, try things I normally wouldn't try, socialize with people I otherwise wouldn't talk to, and see if it changes my life.

My teen years were filled with alcoholism. I started drinking at a pretty early age. It caused me so much heartache and drama. I mean, seriously, looking back at most of the problems in my teen years, I'd say at least 90% of those problems were  purely alcohol related. Alcoholism runs in my family. It's in my genetic makeup. Sometimes I wish I had a time machine. I would've went back to my teen years and convinced myself to give up booze. But...that's not reality. What's done is done. I can't change the past. All I can do is learn from those experiences, and to never make the mistakes ever again. The last time I drank was in the summer of 2015. I've been alcohol free ever since.

But with all of that said...I still think about drinking from time-to-time. Especially within the past year. During those dark and stressful times...alcohol calls my name. It's like a demon. Sometimes I get nostalgic about it. Sometimes I have the desire to return to that life. But thankfully, I can't seem to bring myself to do that. There's been times where I've purchased alcohol, sat around and debated on drinking it, only to never even touch it. A complete waste of money. But still, booze haunts me. As much as I'd like to think that I could return to that lifestyle, I know I can't. I know what drinking will lead to. It will lead to nothing more than darkness and despair. Thinking about all those godawful hangovers also helps motivate me to not drink as well. Oh, how I surely don't miss those awful hangovers.

But sometimes I get jealous, knowing that other people in this world can drink, and not go crazy, and fall into a cycle of alcoholism. Not also is alcohol extremely addictive for me, but it also makes me absolutely crazy. I'm a violent drunk. My brain and alcohol are not at all compatible. It brings out the worst in me. And I constantly have to remind myself of that.

It is truly, a never ending battle. And the scary part is, knowing how everything could change so quickly. I mean, sure, I'm totally clean and sober now. But tomorrow, something could trigger me, and before I know it...I could be drinking again. It is without a doubt, a slippery slope.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7899349}"

My first taste of alcohol was at a church communion service when I went overseas to France for the first time when I was 19 haha. Probably didn't start drinking as a normal part of life until I was 25. Am not too far from 40 now. 

I worked in the food/beverage formulation industry and have always had a thing for trying new things and tasting as much different stuff as I can. Never really drank for the sake of drinking but love the taste/chill effect of certain alcoholic beverages have created a fair amount of my own.

I'm living back in Europe and enjoy alcohol on a regular basis but am rarely drunk except maybe once a year at a really important party. However, I drink pretty regularly in small amount, probably more nights a week with 1-2 25cl beers than nights not drinking. I get home from work and as soon as I unload a bit of that weight/pressure from my shoulders I just want a cold beer or a glass of wine. If I'm on my own this can turn into more like the equivalent of a half+ bottle of wine or 2-3 pints. However, I feel the effects of that on my sleep pretty quick so I've gotten smarter about not doing that too much cause I just sleep worse than if I didn't drink. I also get (sorry for TMI) less performance in bed if I've drank a bit more. I see these things clearly and so tend to try to avoid it, but I've found the only way for me to really avoid having a drink is to just not have something in the house. I don't feel I NEED a drink, but I want a drink most evenings when I come home even if it's a small amount.

I'm fit, run regularly, and don't like being ""out of it.""

I've considered, however, trying to make some rules like never drinking on my own, just with friends or when I'm out, to cut down on some of this regular drinking.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I don't like the idea of wanting it regularly and giving in even if it's WAY less than people I see around me.

At what point in your opinion does wanting become needing and being an alcoholic? Can one be an alcoholic in terms of regularity as opposed to volume? 

I don't want to find myself down the road really hooked on this more than I already am and figure as I'm quite aware of my situation now that it could be a good point to be able to really be able to say ""hey, this is not big deal."" or ""hey, regardless of volume, this is much too regular and setup some boundaries.""

What confuses me is that whenever he comes back he stops drinking. He visits once a year, bar is in another place. Not even one drop for a month, then he’s back at it. 
He’s like two different people; when he changes geographical locations his outlook changes. He wouldn’t stop drinking when I lived with him and it was so bad when he drank at night, when he comes to visit me he is normal.
What is this, I can’t call him an alcoholic, he gets mad at the mention of the word and states that he can/does stop.

I would occasionally black out and my friends would tell me I was just being funny, nothing too terrible.

As school got more stressful and as I got older, I started using alcohol to medicate and forget about the world. My blackouts got more frequent and my actions would become more severe.

I was not planning to acknowledge my anniversary publicly at all this year actually, because I always feel kind of weird about doing that, but as I was journaling today, I somehow ended up writing a novel about it, so here we are. 

This is actually really embarrassing, and I acknowledge that I am completely blowing up my own spot on the internet to people that I do not know and that do not have the first clue about my past because I've been very careful to protect it, but I feel like this is also important. I'm attempting to be vulnerable right now, because Brene Brown says vulnerability is a good thing, and Brene Brown is Bae, but I’m also terrified of judgment.

This year has been very hard to say the least. I work full time during the day and have class 4 nights a week some days until 10. I'm tired, overworked, overwhelmed, broke (my own fault), and pretty depressed most of the time. I'm too busy to adequately take care of myself most days. I'm really struggling to consistently eat well, sleep enough, get to the gym, and be of service in any capacity. I only get to one or two meetings a week if that and I’m not sponsoring anybody, because I don’t have time. I started smoking again and really want to stop, but you know how that goes. I’m also having a hard time being present in my relationships. I might be there physically, but emotionally I am miles away. 

I wake up every day and I feel trapped. Every time I come up for air, another random wave that I didn't see coming knocks me out and fills my lungs with metaphorical water. Some days I literally feel like I can't breathe. Like there is just this invisible weight coming down on my chest and crushing me, hour after hour, day after day. It's insufferable at times. There are brief reprieves, but generally, its been rough. I promise I’ll get to the hope soon. 

As the result of being too tired, too busy, or let's be honest, too unwilling to work on myself during this period, I've watched my general emotional state slowly decline, and to be frank, I've thought about drinking a lot. If someone randomly brings up alcohol in conversation lately, I actually start to disassociate right in front of them. They are still talking to me about whatever, but my mind is somewhere else trying to remember what alcohol feels like when it first hits your stomach. 

I've felt extreme jealously toward coworkers of mine who go to happy hour after work or go home after a long day and drink a glass of wine on the couch or in the bath to unwind. I’ve scrolled through Instagram stories of friends drinking, paused them, and felt myself get really uncomfortable as I started to imagine what their drinks taste like. I felt jealousy toward my family members who were all drinking white claw and enjoying our beach house weekend last month while I was drinking la croix. I often sit and wonder what it might be like to sit around a dinner table with my friends, eating good food, and drinking good wine. I got sober at 19 and never got to experience what that's like. I've never had one glass of ""good"" wine in my life. Franzia and Barefoot forever&lt;/3. And I never got to try a white claw GAH.

I've been finding myself feeling like I'm missing out on something recently, and this makes me really sad and REALLY angry. all. the. time. Especially because I know, and 100% understand, that this is insane thinking, that I’m missing actual nothing, and that drinking will never improve my situation. I’ve done enough drinking for one lifetime. But this is just the reality of what alcoholism and recovery looks like for me sometimes. 

For the last week or so as my anniversary has gotten closer, I've been reflecting on the last year, and I've felt incredible shame and guilt about this. Although I've been physically sober for a while now, my brain, overwhelmed by these feelings of failure for “missing the mark” on self care and for experiencing this recurring obsession about alcohol again, has told me that I don't deserve to celebrate this milestone. I know this shit sounds wild, because I am definitely physically sober, but in my brain, it's 100% real and very intense. (if you know, you know). My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to do anything for my anniversary, and I basically shrugged and said no, because I just didn't want to make a thing about it this year. It all felt wrong. 

I've been talking about this to those who are close to me, and the more I share about it, the more I begin to realize that nothing about this experience is a failure. I’ve gone through this before in recovery, but never to the extent that I am right now, and that’s ok. It doesn’t mean that I’m doing it wrong, that I’m doomed to relapse, or that there’s something wrong with me. It’s just part of the process right now. Things are challenging at the moment for sure, but things are also beautiful and transformative. I really don’t know shit at the end of the day, but if there’s one thing I do know, it’s that everything is temporary, and these feelings will pass. 

Nothing that I'm going through right now is bad, and not one single thing that I am doing at the moment would even be possible for the ""me"" of 6 years ago, so that’s pretty cool. Everything I'm facing right now is a gift and is the direct result of a life I've worked so hard for. A life I’ve been given a second chance to live. A life I legit almost lost. 

Almost 9 years ago I dropped out of high school, because my addiction took over my life, and I couldn’t face failing. I moved to Florida to run away from the mess that I made back home. I was so ashamed and humiliated about who I was and everything I’d done. 8 years ago the doctor told me my liver enzymes were too high at age 18. 7 years ago, I could not get through one day without putting a substance into my body. I couldn't even take a shower sometimes, because I was so sick. 7 years ago, I could barely hold a job (even working for my dad slinging ice cream). 7 years ago, I quit college. 6 years ago, I had already been to 3 rehabs and 5 detoxes within a 3 year period. 6 years ago, after getting arrested, I told a CO in jail to go fuck themselves and lost my license for a year. 6 years ago, I was sent to the ER in an ambulance on 2 separate occasions in less than 90 days. 6 years ago, I almost lost my life in a back alley next to a dumpster. So, 6 years ago, I made a decision. 

I decided that alcohol would no longer be my master. No matter how hard life got, or how unbearable my feelings became, I made a decision not to to drink or use drugs no matter what, one day at a time, and I've made that decision for 2,190 days in a row now. 

Something that I've learned these last few years is that recovery is not linear, and anyone who tells you that or who makes you feel like sobriety is nothing but peace and serenity all the time is a fucking douchebag. Everything is always changing and shifting. The only constant in my life is not drinking. Emotional ups and downs are still normal for me, and I've had to learn how to become malleable and how to experience intense emotions without running away or letting them consume me they way they used to. Maybe your experience in sobriety is or will be different than mine, but my recovery so far has been littered with periods of really intense darkness followed by periods of pure happiness and peace. It's always worth it though, and I'm grateful every day. 

Life did not suddenly become easy when I got sober like I thought it would. Maybe for a little while. My pink cloud probably lasted a year or two. But I’ve learned that the world and the people in it do not owe me anything. As time goes on, I still feel pain regularly, I still have bad days, I still randomly burst into tears in my car sometimes when a song comes on that brings up past trauma, and I'm still afraid all the fucking time no matter how many fears I face along the way. What has changed is my ability to stand my ground and experience everything, good or bad, that life has to offer. I do not run. 

You may be confused about why I would day dream about something as innocuous as drinking wine around a table with my friends when I just revealed that I overdosed on a literal curb next to an actual dumpster 6 years ago, because that is one WIDE margin of delusion, but addiction is a subtle foe. My addiction may sound like me and think like me, but it's something else entirely. It's like a virus that waits patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike. It will plant an unrealistic image in my head, when I'm tired, weak, and vulnerable, and like a virus, it disguises itself as part of me so that I'll let it slip past my defenses undetected. The idea will take root and grow and meander through all of the dark corners of my mind like a vine, latching onto my insecurities and fears and refusing to let go. It tells me, ""it will be different this time"". It tries to convince me that I was just a dumb kid with a lot of trauma and no coping skills, but now I'm a grown ass adult, I've been to therapy, and god dammit I deserve a ""glass"" of wine after a hard day. I was ashamed to admit that I had been feeling this way to my support group because well, “I shouldn't still feel this way with 6 years of sobriety."" Whatever the fuck that means. 

Before getting sober I always had this misconception that someone with a year or more of sobriety had it all figured out. Most of us feel this way in the beginning. I thought they were spiritual giants, and I put them up on pedestals. I honestly thought they were better than me. I truly hope nobody ever feels that way about me. The longer I’ve been sober, the less “sober time” actually matters in the grand scheme. There is no golden year or amount of time that we reach and the growth just stops. The journey doesn't just end, and I'm grateful for that. The journey is what I signed up for. In the day is where life happens for me, and more and more, that’s where I try to stay. 

Even though I’m sober, I can still be a piece of shit sometimes. I'm still mean for no reason some days. I experience rage, envy, and hatred. I'm SO selfish, impatient, impulsive, and I can't make good financial decisions AT ALL most of the time. I still have to make amends when I’m
wrong, which happens to be a lot, and I am constantly beating myself up for not meeting my own unreasonable standards and expectations. 

But I am also getting better. I am often kind, generous, hardworking, loving, ambitious, adventurous, passionate, thoughtful, and honest. I own my shit today, and I take responsibility for my actions. Sobriety has given me the ability to take an honest appraisal of myself and to love myself for not just my great qualities, but also for all of my faults and flaws as well. With each year that passes, I learn more about what it truly means to love yourself and to love others. Sobriety has given me the opportunity to know myself- to know who I am at my core and not shy away or crawl out of my skin when things are hard to look at. Sobriety has given me every single good thing that I have in my life today. It has given me the ability to see others and to let them see me, to love unconditionally (in a healthy, independent way), and to experience the other side of true hopelessness. 

But most of all, sobriety has given me a choice. I never had that before, and I refuse to give that up for the delusion of drinking one glass of wine on the couch while watching Ghost Adventures on a Thursday night, because #1, that's dumb, and #2, the reality of that delusion is as follows: 

Me, two bottles of gas station wine deep, wandering around in the dark screaming at ghosts to come fight me.

So if any of my sober peeps feel this way right now, especially my young friends, it’s ok if your time in sobriety is not an accurate measure of what you feel your character or your life should reflect at this point. I know that we all ""know"" this to some extent, but a lot of us still feel shame when it happens to us, and we still try to hide it by putting on an act that everything is fine. 

And if you’re newly sober or wanting to get sober, please don’t let anything I’ve said deter you. I’ve only made one good choice in my life and that was getting sober. Every other good choice that followed was just the result. 

It's ok to be honest when we feel like we've missed the mark. It's ok to be vulnerable about this. It's ok to let people see the truth of what recovery looks like sometimes. It's ok if you’re not ok right now. We still deserve to celebrate.

I've been a semi-heavy drinker for a while now, since around 23-24. I usually drank around a 6 packs worth of alcohol on weekdays and MUCH more over the weekends. Sometimes more, never less. I never really had a reason to drink, mostly it was just because I was bored. Probably not the best excuse, but I didn't do much with my free time, besides drink with friends at a bar. This may not be the right place since I'm not looking to fully quit alcohol (at least if I can't handle just cutting back at the moment), now I""m a much more active person and I have a good bunch of hobbies (and better friends) that are (for the most part) the reason I'm quitting, as drinking was starting to get in the way of things I wanted to do. There was also that one time I didn't feel like drinking one night and then had withdrawals the next day at work so bad I had to run to the nearest store and chug 3 beers in my car so I could stop the shakes at 9 am...sobering experience if there ever was one.  


So over the last few months I've been working on very slowly cutting back instead of just cutting it cold turkey. This is a two pronged approach as I couldn't afford to take the time off to be that sick since I just got into a new job, and mainly I""m trying to re-wire how I look at drinking, not as an outlet to get drunk but as something to enjoy occasionally. So far I've been doing a good job of just cutting back, I've gotten down to only a single beer a night with the occasional, allocated, night of getting loosy goosy with friends at a bar or whatnot. I'm at about the two week mark of this (one beer only), and I'm feeling better but I'm still having anxiety attacks, random pains, never really feeling fully rested, etc, etc, etc, etc. I know its still alcohol related as it'll go away whenever I do have any alcohol. I'm also aware this might just be stretching out the pain but so far its working for me...and its getting lesser and less everyday.  


To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm posting this. My girlfriend, family, and friends have all been super supportive of me. They've all been completely fine with me calling them at 4 in the morning cuz I woke up scared with sweats and trouble breathing, or just being a randomly irritable jackass. I guess, just like anybody...I'm just looking for a little reassurance from people who've gone through it before. ""Everythings ok, the pain will pass, you'll come out a better person, your at the end, I'm proud of you"".   


And to anybody going through the same thing. You got this! The pain will pass, and you will be a better person. I wish you the best.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5042055}"

Since this weekend, it’s been every other day. I’d usually have a nip or two of hard liquor, some other times a moderate amount of wine, other days beer. I’ve had an entire liter of rum in a day a couple of months ago, and had the worst hangover.

This hangover feels different.

A friend of mine and I drank a ton of wine within about two hours. He had around 8 glasses, I had around 4 or 5. Mind you, I’m a bit of a lightweight. After a really embarrassing moment between us, I somehow walked home. I recommend that no one does this - I was worried for my friends’ safety if he did drive, despite his insistence. 

Feeling emotional, I choked back about half a beer that I had in the fridge when I got home. Within an hour, I was profusely vomiting all over the side of my bed while trying to make it to the bathroom. Yesterday was okay, aside from some lasting lightheaded ness, but today it feels like I have a full on flu. Woke up with bad, painful, and bloating acid reflux in my upper stomach. I feel cold and shivery - yet was able to catch some sleep. Stomach feels completely uneasy.

I believe I may have, or am developing an issue. I need help getting sober and staying sober. I don’t want this to be a cycle.

I (33) love my husband (36) so much, but in the last year and a half, his alcoholism escalated from functional to spiraling. His personality has changed. And I feel crazy and guilty for looking at an apartment and into a new job (we work together), because he says it’s me. That I’m controlling.
We have been married three years, together six.
Almost two months ago he drove drunk with two of our kids in the car. I got a call at work from the oldest one who said he was acting weird. Said he drove over some woman’s yard and the kids had to walk him into the house. I raced home, the police were there. His mom was already at the house because she lives close and I had called her so she could get there ASAP. She wouldn’t let the cops in, so he wasn’t arrested. I wish he had been. He yelled at me, yelled at his mom, shoved me (he’s never in our relationship put his hands on me). And then when he sobered up, apologized to everyone. Swore he’d never drink again. Did outpatient rehab, had to leave after three weeks because of insurance. Then slowly the narrative changed. The remorsefulness turned into impatience and him saying he made a mistake once (it hasn’t even been two months), and he began to say he isn’t damaged goods, that he wants to drink occasionally, like a normal person.
I started noticing a smell on him but he swears it’s not alcohol. And the older kids noticed that he acted different, one day specifically, one of them said he was acting like he did the day he drove drunk.
Three days ago he went to the bar after a two day argument him and I had. He says he wouldn’t have gone if I hadn’t pushed and poked him. He says I’m controlling because I am telling him I can’t be with him if he drinks. He says I’m not allowed to tell him he’s playing the victim (he is, he’s mad at his family for not being over it).
I love him very much, but before the drunk driving incident, he was already supposed to be cutting back. And instead of following the agreement, he was lying and sneaking while I was at work, drinking more and then making me feel guilty for asking him about it. 
I’m not perfect, nobody is in a marriage, but he makes me feel like this is my fault. He makes me feel bad for reacting to everything he’s done. The two kids that were in the car are 12. One moved out to live with her mom because (she’s my step kid), because she’s afraid of him now. The other one is afraid to be in the car with him, and in response to that, my husband is mad I have to leave work to pick up the kids. 
Can someone give me some perspective? I am talking to an attorney and I’m looking into a career change (fortunately I have a degree to fall back on), but I love my husband. I don’t want to rip apart our family, but I know I can’t change him. He doesn’t even think he’s wrong",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4542399}"

My expartner is so amazing. I'm a fucking creep and I'm into lots of weird stuff, he was always supportive even though he wasn't into my stuff. We were together nearly 6 yrs. 

About two yrs ago we found out that he had pancreatitis. He didn't tell me then that it was alcohol induced. Within those two yrs he went from happy and functioning and loving and active to doubled over vomiting for days, hiding water bottles full of vodka all around the house and car, he was never awake, he was always in such intense pain. 

He was drinking bottles of vodka every day. I would go to work thinking he was in so much pain from this disease, and he would go to the liquor store and drink all day long. I would find bottles and cups that smelled like nail polish remover. But he just denied. 

He was having seizures from detoxing every week or two. He was constantly out of work and in the hospital.  

He never physically hurt me. He put me thru hell watching him die. Suffering over and over, so I kicked him out of my house. Then he did it to his mom. 

She told him that he had to go to rehab or get out of her house, and I told him it was over. I didn't want to... But it felt like I had to.

This turned into a three day bender for him where the whole time he was extremely intoxicated, with half the people casually drinking and the other half not drinking at all. As I was leaving on Sunday at 3pm, whilst he was passed out drunk, I told the rest of my friends that Friday was the last time I would ever drink with him. Seeing him that way was too upsetting to me.

I have not spoken to my friend since. How do I approach him about this? Do I tell him that I think he is an alcoholic or do I wait for the opportunity when he goes to drink when we have a gathering to say we aren’t going to drink anymore, or do I do this one on one? 

What can I do to help? Everything online immediately jumps to “intervention” and “rehab”, but I want to give him the benefit of recognizing and trying to deal with it on his own/with our help. I honestly have no idea how to approach this.

She has 32 years of sobriety. She is unapologetically herself. She dresses wild and unusual but with such a swagger. I didn’t know how to pick a sponsor let alone have the courage to ask. When she shared her story it was eerily similar to mine and thus finally gathered the courage to approach and say hi.  Thankfully she said yes and we’ve been developing our relationship ever since. 
I respect her and am grateful to her but I fear she is no longer a good fit. 

I find it uncomfortable that she only wants to talk about me. I’m not allowed to ask her how her day is or what she is up to.  I am trying to foster a relationship. This requires a two way exchange. I should be able to ask how her day is and what she’s doing

First she tells me I need to txt daily, when I did that it became I should call. When I did that it’s that I should txt to ask what time I can call. I just feel like no matter what I do or don’t do it’s not good enough or proper. 

We haven’t progressed past step 2. I keep trying to schedule these sessions but it’s best for me to do this on the weekends. She prefers weekdays. I tried weekdays but then it becomes an hour and a half of chitchat, then she takes me to a mtg, then it’s post mtg breakdown, so it essentially takes up >3 hrs. 

She’s asking me to prioritize AA over my passion of yoga. She wants me to attend a meeting a day. I’m a year sober, I feel like it should be more couple times a week and ramp up as needed. If I go daily then it becomes overbearing and something I must do vs choose / want to do. 

Finally what was hurtful was me sharing my status of my relationship and a recent argument that we had. She got defensive when I pointed out the call/txt/weekend scenario above and said she is in a loving relationship and actually wants to spend time with her boyfriend. 

Now I’m thinking just because she’s 32 years sober and still attends mtgs daily, she might not be the best role model.

2019-11-06 02:37:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/dsd123/six_months_rehab_works/,Six Months - Rehab Works!,"Hey all!

Well the days has come.  I've reached 6 months.  The past few months have been full of learning and plenty of great ups and downs.  I checked myself into rehab in the Dallas area for 45 days in late April.  With a lot of encouragement and support with my wife and family, it was time to clean up and get sober for real.  I can honestly say that rehab probably saved my life.

I was a fairly good at managing my drinking, so I thought.  I was fully aware how much I was drinking was bad for me and **WAY** more than anyone else.  I was drinking daily to being drunk and forget about weekends...these were round the clock benders.  But the thing is, I never got in trouble (no arrests), never fought anyone or got into arguments.  I do admit that I made ass many a time though.  I was leading almost a double life with my drinking alone, lying about drinking, sneaking drinks etc.  

&#x200B;

There was no ""it moment"" or incident that drove me to get help.

  
What I want to tell you is that you are not alone.  Seriously.  If you are like I was, try going to a counselor first.  Speak with them at length and be honest about your drinking.  These people are trained and well versed on addiction.  They may ask if you could have depression, anxiety, insomnia, or other disorders that can be treated with medication.  I learned in rehab that **MOST** those suffering from addiction also have an underlying condition like I mentioned.  If you don't like the idea of a counselor, talk with someone you know and trust.  This can be a close friend, family member, coach.  Tell them you need help but this needs to be 100% confidential.  People want to help!  

&#x200B;

The truth is, and this will be hard to swallow...most people will need professional help to get sober.  I always shrugged that off the 500x times I tried to quit on my own.  If you can afford the time away/costs of going to a rehab, I really suggest it.  It will not be easy.  The daunting idea of being away from work, living in a rehab center away from home/loved ones is hard to swallow.  The idea that people may find out and you will be labeled an ""addict"" of ""drunk"" is hard as well.

&#x200B;

Let's get real:  The 45 days away went by relatively quickly.  The rehab I went to was not covered by insurance.  I chose private pay as the rehabs that I researched (that were covered by insurance) completely turned me off.  Many of them seemed like county jail.  The 4 that I looked at had mandatory bedtimes, shit food, very limited internet/phone access, several men to a bedroom, people forced there as part of a sentencing/probation, and those addicted to hard stuff.  I was able to make a deal with my parents and they foot the bill for a place called Enterhealth Ranch outside of Dallas.  This place offered to-notch care with lots of comforts of home, personal rooms/showers, great food, wi-fi/phone twice a day.  The thing is, at the expensive rehabs, there is little worry/concern about anything other than getting well.   

&#x200B;

I am convinced that if you can afford it, get to a decent rehab where you feel comfortable.  Many places offer financing and payment plans.  I'm not saying go to those places you see on TV, but affordable rehab is out there you just may have to fly to get there.  These institutions can offer so much more than what insurance covers.  1:1 with counselors, life coaches, job coaching, 1:1 with MDs with backgrounds in addiction.  They will ease you out of withdrawl and prescribe sleep and non-habit forming anxiety medication.  They will really help with reviewing your physical and blood work results and help you identify underlying conditions with much better attention.  To me, not having to worry about sketchy people, feeling unsafe,",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49057543}"

It has started innocently, used to go grab couple of drinks w my friends every now and then. After a while (after I turned the legal drinking age -18) I sometimes bought myself like can or two of beer after school just to get in the mood. 2 beers eventually turned into 4, 4 turned into a wine, wine turned into a wine and a beer. And later on I sometimes even got myself a bottle of hard liquor, that I used to mix w beers just to get more drunk and spend less. I have been doing this - getting drunk alone like 4 days in a week for like the past 10 months (w some breaks meaning when I was on family vac or something) back then I wasn’t really craving it, it just made me feel better and helped me cope better w all my problems. And I had no problem deciding not to drink for a night or even a longer while if something important was up in my life such as finals in school and such.  The first sign of alcohol addiction I noticed was when I was gone for three weeks in summer (in US where I couldn’t get any myself) and I still proceeded to get some twice through friends because I wasn’t able to wait, and I needed it. 

This year I started college and as we all probably know, people do drink a lot of alcohol in college. So I used to go out more often w my friends, and I used to get really wasted. So many times I reached the point that I wouldn’t remember much. Or I drank way more than most of my friends, and always suggested to take more shots, until I was the level of drunk that I was reaching for. And the days I wouldn’t go with them I would drink by myself at home. So 4 days of okay drinking turned into 6 of heavy drinking. (With of course some exceptions). 

The last sign that convinced me that this might be a real issue was that I really started to crave alcohol a lot. Not because I wanna go out and have fun, but because I wanna get drunk. Every night I decide I that I won’t drink because I have to wake up early and do stuff for school is horrible. I just can’t wait until the next day when as a treat for being responsible I’ll get some. 

It would be really helpful if any of you shared some experience with me, or ideas how to get out of this, Should I tell my parents (they would be awfully disappointed and I feel like it would make my mental state even worse). Is it too late, to actually eventually manage to be a healthy drinker( grab a couple of drinks w friends every now and then) or will I never be able to drink again, cause my addiction is too bad. I’m really scared. Thank you if you read it all the way down here.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4792651}"

I think you have a good idea of what it is like to interact with an alcoholic. I stuck by her because I loved her and had faith in her to get better. I never wanted to abandon her because I know she's sick and it's not who she is. I tried to be understanding but her past behavior did cause conflict and resentment. Took a toll on me, self doubt, anxious. Yesterday she cheated on me. She was craving so left to get a drink, didn't hear from her and I knew something was wrong. Now I cant even look at her. She turns into a completely different person, knowing who she was I endured a lot. I questioned my decision staying, made me feel weak and lacking self respect (because of my own principles) for not being able to walk away but man did I love her and it was right back to her lovable self when she was sober. Roped me back in. I was always afraid of this happening. Always disappointed when she drank but I laid off on the topic of alcohol. She would get upset as she was already hard on herself. She thought she could handle herself. Knew she was kidding herself. She was always so proud of herself when she did. She never really listened to me when it came to this or when I told her to slow down. She always thought she had it handled when she clearly didn't. 

I don't know what to do or how to feel. I don't want to feel unstable in my relationship. This time around she's going to AA, looks promising for her. Hope she sticks with it. I just cant get past this. A part of me 'hates' her. She explained it was like she was aware but couldn't stop herself.

I drank very heavily for all of 2017 ( daily, 100 proof vodka). I ended up getting a dui and lost my license for 3 months. I resorted to drinking listerene on a regular basis (was terrified someone I knew would see me going into the liquor store). July of 2018 I stopped drinking but then started back up at the end of July 2019. Started out slowly but by September I was drinking from 8 am when the liquor store opened until I passed out at night. Eating very little. I didn’t usually get visibly drunk until late at night. I woke up one morning with excruciating pain under my rib cage that ended up extending through my back. I went to the doctor who sent me to the ER thinking it was my gallbladder. They did tests and I found out my liver was badly scarred and I had pancreatitis from alcoholism. I was admitted and had to go for several days without food or water to let my pancreas heal and was given IV fluids. They also treated my for alcohol withdrawals with Librium and Ativan. I had hallucinations like you wouldn’t believe. My heart pounded. I shook. And this was with the meds. I can’t imagine what wouldve happened if I’d gone cold turkey at home. I was told I’d probably have seized up and died. Alcohol withdrawals are nothing to take lightly. I’m wondering if anyone else has had pancreatitis and how long their recovery took? I don’t understand how I drank (though heavily) for a relatively short time (compared to ppl Ive met in AA who’ve spent their whole adult lives drinking) & did THIS MUCH damage to my body. It’s been almost a month since I was in the hospital. When I got out I swore I’d never drink again and made it 14 days before I slipped up and drank. I only drank a couple times but I also know my body can’t handle even a couple times. I’m young and I’m terrified that this will kill me. I plan to get back to meetings. Please pray for me, if you’re the praying type. I was addicted to opiates and have been off of them for 7.5 years, and what I never imagined anything would bring me to my knees like that did, but the alcohol is even worse. I don’t even like the way it feels to be drunk, yet I crave the alcohol. Makes no sense to me. I loved the warm happy feeling of the opiates, so that addiction I understood. The alcohol I don’t get. I guess maybe in the short term, it lessens my anxiety. But in the long run it worsens it. There is no worse feeling than coming to in the middle of the night, heart pounding, having no recollection of the night before, what you did, who you pissed off, or how you humiliated yourself. That’s a feeling I pray I’ll never feel again. It’s felt sooo good here lately to go to bed at night, coherent, and knowing that when I wake, it won’t be in a panic, from a blackout. Also, the guilt I felt when coming to after a blackout was awful. I just pray I can stay sober.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88437593}"

He has been drinking since i was 13. He drank Budweiser back then. It wasn’t until i was about 15 he started drinking Seagrams seven.. i think that’s what it’s called. And he wasn’t a nice drunk. He would wake me up in the middle of the night just to fight. It was just us because my mom left us for meth so he raised me. I sorta raised him if we wanna get real. Anyways. About 2 years ago he was diagnosed with cirrhosis. Was told to quit drinking but he didn’t. One day we found him at home pretty much unconscious and dying. His girlfriend at the time was an alcoholic as well so from what I’ve gathered she didnt want to ruin her fun and call his family and say hey there’s a problem. I seen him on a regular basis so when i went a couple of weeks without seeing him i knew something was wrong. To make a long story short my family went to his house, carried him out to the car. Took him to the hospital. He had sepsis. He was in icu from first week of August to first week of October. He survived that. Then fast forward a year and my family and i would call his phone one day: we had a birthday get together on a Saturday... the following Monday he would answer the phone but not say anything. My aunt , my husband and i went to his house. Got inside and found him in the back bedroom asleep. He was acting normal but if you talked to him he wouldn’t say anything. Turns out he had a hemorrhagic stroke they called it. We couldn’t pinch the spot where the bleed occurred because he would bleed out on the table due to the cirrhosis. Fast forward to about 6 months ago,,, had a seizure at a stop light. Luckily he was stopped. Was released that night. Now ... about a month ago he had an episode at work. He’s out of work for 12 weeks. When he first went into the hospital for sepsis he was prescribed lactulose . I’m sure most of you know what that is and what it does. When you have to use the bathroom due to this medication you better be within seconds of one. He’s not taking it the way he should. Since he had his latest episode at work and hasn’t been going since he’s on short term disability things are different. He can’t remember what month it is. Sometimes he doesn’t make sense. Like the other day i was over there and he just wasn’t talking. I mean he can .. but when he moves it’s like he’s in slow motion. Sometimes he sounds ok and sometimes he doesn’t. He texts me stuff that doesn’t make sense. And he Always answers my phone call. We talk every night. Up until recently. He doesn’t want to get together and spend time together, won’t answer my call a lot of times. He talks like he’s drunk but i dunno if he’s drunk or it’s the ammonia in his brain. I know a regular ammonia level is like 30-49. This passed time it was 140. He just seems to be going down hill. He’s never gotten so bad so quick. He told me today he has fallen some because  his legs aren’t working right. But doesn’t want to go to the hospital. And told me thanksgiving is in March??? I don’t know what’s going on. He will tell me over and over he’s taking his lactulose. He’s in stage four liver cirrhosis. Is his liver just failing and the lactulose isn’t working? I need some advice. This stress is going to kill me. Do i let go and let God? Please give me your advice .

Most of the time, my mother is a brilliant person. She supports me and my sister brilliantly and has been a brilliant mum to me my entire life. However, I feel like her alcohol consumption is a bit worrying, and I seem to to be the only one that's concerned about it.

Most nights, she falls asleep on the sofa with a drink in her hand, and often times I just leave her there to get into bed herself, but tonight when I went downstairs and saw her there at 5am, she woke up with a fright, and started talking nonsense to me. I helped her get into bed, and it turns out that she was so drunk that she ended up forgetting to feed the dog. This really hurts me, since she normally isn't this bad, but I can't help but fear that her dependence may be evolving. She already has a difficulty to stop

I've confronted her about this before, but she denies even having a problem which really frustrates me even though I've told her about how I hate it when she's drunk and have to help her into bed. My dad has voiced his opinions to me (I'm 18 by the way) about how he doesn't like how much my mum drinks and that I shouldn't have to be the one to take her to bed, but I feel like he tries to just divert my attention elsewhere as if this isn't a problem. My sister knows that my mother drinks, but I feel like she doesn't really know the true extent of how much she drinks either.

We went out for a family meal today which was brilliant, but I feel like these get-togethers are a factor in how much my mum drinks. She tends to drink more, and even after we've been out with family and had a few drinks, she always comes back home and has multiple more, passing out on the sofa, which she does most nights anyway.

Another worrying thing is that she has trouble to stop drinking after starting. Often times, she only realises she's had enough once she passes out on the sofa in front of the TV and gets into bed, and I hate how I have to walk in on her like this, it's very embarrassing for me. My dad's pretty much given up on trying to help her, and it's unclear if he truly thinks there is no way to help her, or if he doesn't think that her situation is a problem that action needs to be taken.

Either way, I want to help her overcome her problem, but I don't even know where to begin, especially because she won't even admit to having a problem herself. While drunk at a family get-together once, she didn't believe my dad once when he told her that I got upset at how much she was drinking, and while drunk, she just dismisses you if you tell her she's drunk which also really annoys me. It doesn't help that my relatives don't recognise when she's had enough to drink either, and they almost enable this by offering her multiple drinks; more than she should be having.

Even when sober, she never admits to having a problem, and rarely admits that she was even drunk or had too much to drink the night before.

However, her alcohol situation doesn't affect her daily life, it only happens at night. She never drinks in the morning or afternoon to my knowledge, and not once did she fail to do the school run to take me or my sister to school/college as a result of alcohol. She cooks amazing meals in the evenings and looks after me, my sister, and my family brilliantly, it's just that her consumption of alcohol at night has taken its toll lately and I am fearful that her situation could evolve into something worse.

I've taken some online tests, and one did show that she has a high risk of becoming alcohol dependent which frightens me. My mum and dad have been together my life and I really don't want them splitting up, especially if it's to do with something which can be resolved. I want to resolve this situation peacefully before it evolves and takes a turn for the worse.

Can anyone give me advice on what I should do to help her? I love my mother. She's been brilliant to me and helped me through some tough times, and now I want to help her. I would hate for her to become an alcoholic, and I want to prevent that in anyway I can.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78981346}"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but here I go anyway. 

I live at home currently and have two younger siblings. When my mom drinks, she drinks a lot. So much in fact, that I'm wondering how I've never seen her throw up. She only drinks when my dad isn't home because he's yelled at her about it and gotten really upset at her and she always hides it from him. When my dad buys alcohol and comes home to see nearly a whole bottle finished, my mom always gives him the same excuse, ""duhhvinci's friends came over last night and I let them drink."" She always tells me to go with it, and I do. (My friends are all over 18, so it's a reasonable excuse, and I never get yelled at because he feels okay with the idea of and my friends drinking at home. I feel like my parents helped me develop a healthy relationship with alcohol because they started to let me drink on vacation since I was 15, and I never actually cared for it until I was 18 and started drinking in moderation at parties. It never seemed ""forbidden"" to me, so I feel like I had a healthy relationship with it and never felt the need to sneak around as i know my parents would gladly make me a drink at home. I feel obligated to always cover up for her because she's caught me smoking weed countless times and never told my father, so I feel like I owe her one.) 

She drinks whenever my dad isn't home, so maybe twice a weekend night and occasionally in the morning when my siblings and I are at school. I come home in the afternoon maybe twice a month to find her slurring and drunk. She drinks a lot, but incredibly, does everything she normally does while blacked out and drunk out of her mind. She's never hurt herself, us, or anyone while drunk. She's only been passed out once in the bathroom and thankfully my siblings were in bed long before that. She stumbles around slurs her words a lot, and keeps on asking the same questions over and over. However, she manages to cook, clean, and do everything a mom would do, but while drunk. Last night, she drank over half a HANDLE OF VODKA over the course of 13-15 hours. She drank, passed out, woke up, drank again, and did that three times total. I don't understand how she can drink so much, she's a small woman too. 

I know alcoholism is defined by not being able to go about one's day without drinking. Is this just a moderation problem or developing alcoholism? I feel like if we always had alcohol in the house this would be happening every single day, but when we do have it, she doesn't seem to have a limit.

Here are my concerns.

1) I think my younger siblings are aware of her excessive drinking. They spend weekend nights playing video games in their rooms but they obviously have seen her inebriated and that really worries me. My younger brother actually hid a handle of whiskey in his room and when I asked him why, he said he was hiding it from mom. My younger siblings are clearly picking up on this. 

2) Since she ""functions"" normally even while slurring and stumbling, managing to do chores, etc, she might refuse that she has a problem. 

3) My dad knows somewhat about this as he's come to find her slurring and drunk but never talks to me about it. I know he knows something is going on but has never talked to me about it. And as mentioned, he doesn't think that she drinks as much as she does, because he always thinks it's me and my friends drinking.

4) It's fucking embarrassing having my friends over because even while she's drunk and slurring incomprehensibly she'll attempt to talk to talk to them and I always have to pull them up to my mom.

5) Today morning, I screamed and cried at her and told her about how she has a problem while she was drunk in bed after drinking for maybe the fourth? fifth? sixth? time in a matter of 13-15 hours.

I’m 15F and feel like shit right now. Some days, my dad is the nicest person I know of. The days he isn’t sober, he’s a different person.

I only live with my dad. When he drinks, he gets pretty angry if anyone is in the same room as him. If he’s alone, he seems to be fine from what I know. The things he says when he’s angry make me feel terrible, even though I know he doesn’t really mean them. It’s made me cry for hours in my room which is what’s making me post this now.

I KNOW he’s a great person. When he’s sober, he’s taken me to therapy for my depression, he listens to me and is just a great dad in general.

I have spoken to him about it whilst he’s sober. I said how it affects my feelings and how I can tell he isn’t happy. He just apologises and says it won’t happen again, brushing it off. Once he said he didn’t even speak to me that day, when he did.

I don’t want to lose him, I don’t want him to get into any trouble for it because I don’t think it’s his fault. I really want to help him but he doesn’t seem to want it.  I also don’t want him to get angry at me if I tell anyone.
