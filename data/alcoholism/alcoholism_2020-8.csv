The weekend started innocently enough, with drinks for a co-worker's birthday on a Friday afternoon. FFWD to the following Tuesday, when it ended. One drink turned into hundreds, one night turned into 4, and I awoke in some sleazy motel alone and bewildered. How the fuck did I get here?

College educated, good job, nice house, wife, nice car, etc. I couldn't be an out of control alcoholic. No way. But there I was, alone, felt like shit, spent a ton of money on activities I'd never engage in if not drinking, we all know how it goes. The self-loathing was at an all-time high.

Home I went. I unbuckled the seatbelt and ran the speedometer up...I was going to swerve into one of the concrete barriers, and be done with everything. But I couldn't do it.

I called a friend who I knew was battling alcoholism. I asked for help. I became willing to do whatever it took to not feel this way ever again. If those who had recovered said to do it, I checked the manual and assuming their advice was mostly outlined in the text, I did it. No argument, I just fully surrendered. 

Not here to boast about my accomplishment to date, only to tell those who are struggling with what they think might be a problem: there are others that will help you, and you can do it. I could not have done it alone, I tried a bunch of times on my own- everything. Beer only, never before 5PM, only on weekends, setting limits. Didn't work. Until I got the support and guidance from others who had been there and done that.

So....if I can make it through today, I'll have 14 years off the alcohol. Life does get better, but it doesn't get perfect. To anyone struggling: if I can do it, you can too. Ask for help, become willing, and do the daily work. 

Have a great, alcohol-free weekend everyone. I'm going to try not to drink today, then consider doing it again tomorrow if I make it through today. That's how it works.

With gratitude...",82

He had issues with drinking last summer, would get really emotional and break up with me, try to make reckless decisions. It was hell. Eventually it all came to a head when he blacked out and punched a hole in my wall and got arrested. I was devastated and the court ordered him not to drink and gave him a SCRAM to breathe into 3x a day. When this happened, we talked about it a lot and he said he was fine without alcohol, that he saw this as a good thing, he would never drink again bc alcohol has never done anything good for him. But he would still be able to be around it, encouraged me to still have a drink to wind down, would go out with our friends and stick to Gingerale. So he had me convinced he wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic because I thought if he was one, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay off it.

Fast forward to present day, he broke up with me randomly early Wednesday morning after showing up to my house after drinking. It was the first time I‚Äôd seen him drunk since last September. I knew he‚Äôd had a sip or two here and there, but he hadn‚Äôt been drunk, and he had committed out of his own willpower to continue not drinking when he no longer had the SCRAM. He told me he only had two glasses of wine, but he was slurring and falling over and was clearly extremely irritated, so me addressing his state only served to rile him up more. I feel so stupid because this is exactly what used to happen last summer when he would drink and explode on me. 

I just feel like, was I that blind? Was I dating an alcoholic this whole time? I‚Äôve never had anyone close to me in my life who had major problems with alcohol so I feel like I may have just been blind to it. I‚Äôm heartbroken over the loss of my relationship and now on top of that I feel so confused just regarding what even just happened to me.",4
2020-08-29 07:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iiqkdy/alcoholism_and_cancer_risk/,Alcoholism and cancer risk,"I've been having anxiety over the risk of developing some alcohol related illness, even decades after I quit. I did some research. Hardly scientific but thought I'd share what I found. Using the information on this page https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet  
and incidence rates off Wikipedia. It's reassuring that I don't have like a 50% chance of getting cancer like I was imagining, or something, so I don't have to stress over it to much (which is also a cause of cancer apparently)  
The odds  of developing cancer in heavy drinkers over a span of 55 years for a male (the risk is generally lower for females, except for breast cancer), ignoring all other risk factors, appears to be:  
oral - 5x increased risk. general incidence 6.3/100,000 per year -> 1.7% chance  
larynx - 2.6x increased risk. general incidence 5/100,000 per year -> 0.72% chance  
Esophageal - 5x increased risk. general incidence 5.2/100,000 per year -> 1.43% chance  
liver - 2x increased risk. general incidence 7.2/100,000 per year -> 0.79% chance  
breast - 1.6x general incidence in men extremely rare  
colorectal (bowel) - 1.5x increased risk. general incidence 1 in 19 by age of 75. 1/3 death rate. ->7.9% chance.

Once again, this ignores all other risk factors, including age, and probably isn't terribly accurate. 

In addition, quitting lowers your odds over time, however it can take some time to see the benefits. I can't remember where I read this, but even 16 years after quitting you are still at an increased risk.

Light drinking gives a modest increase in risk. Some have talked about possible health benefits of light drinking, for example drinking red wine, however the negative impacts of doing so outweigh the benefits.",1

My step-brother is an alcoholic. So is his father. Here's the thing, he is very much functional. He is very successful professionally. By all outward accounts, he doesn't have a problem, but he does. He probably has about 10 drinks a day. It's hard to say, because he hides it most of the time, or at least tries to. He doesn't drink at all during the work day, but the minute he gets out of work, he drinks. Like in his car on the way home. He thinks no one knows about that, but they do. When he's confronted about it, he lies. He does drink during the day on weekends. I would not be surprised if he sneaked a drink or two during the work day. He uses his financial and professional success as proof that he doesn't have a problem.

He will go ""use the restroom"" during my nephew's soccer games on weekends, and you can smell the Scotch. He's not drunk, but he's obviously sneaking a flask in and taking sips and thinks no one can notice. I'm sure his kids have noticed but don't say anything. Even if they did say something, he wouldn't actually stop drinking at these events, he would just switch to something you can't smell. In other words, his first thought is not, ""I should really stop,"" but rather is, ""I really need to hide this better.""

He and my SIL have joint accounts for everything. He puts back 2 bottles of Scotch (like the big ones) a week that she knows of, but she noticed that no money was coming out of their account for them anymore. So she asked him about it. He told her some BS about how he prefers to pay cash for it. He doesn't pay cash for ANYTHING else. He's basically just trying to hide how much he is spending at the liquor store from her. 

He will have a couple of drinks in front of my SIL each night, and then starts drinking in earnest once she goes to bed. Again, he thinks he's hiding it. He never gets falling down drunk, but on many occasions, he is obviously buzzed. Holidays he gets noticeably more buzzed because his father is usually there. His father has pretty much the same, exact habits as my SB. I know that deep down, SB knows he has a problem, but he won't admit it. He just thinks he enjoys a drink every now and then. But I do think he's cognizant of the fact that in social situations, he tends to be the guy who always has one or two more than everyone else. When his dad is around, it normalizes how much he drinks, because he's not the only one. So he drinks more.

He makes every excuse in the book. He had a long day, it's a special occasion, it helps him sleep (it makes his sleep worse, but he's in denial on that), he's only had a couple drinks, etc. I point out the sleep thing because he falls asleep at soccer games, movies, any event where he's sitting and can sleep. It's embarrassing.

Here's the thing, SIL is ready to leave. She loves him, and it would kill their kids, but she's done. She's had it with the lying. She's also said she's afraid he will get another DWI (he has one conviction from decades ago and one arrest about 15 years ago that he somehow got dropped). She's afraid he's going to lose his job if he starts drinking during the day, if he hasn't already. She doesn't really want to leave; she wants him to get help. But she knows, and I know, that if she gives him an ultimatum - lose his family or get help/stop drinking - he will choose to lose his family. I have sort of confronted him before, and he just gets defensive and says I'm being ridiculous. Either that or he'll say I'm right and that he will cut back, but that just translates to he needs to do a better job hiding it for a while. He'll do the same thing with her. But she is not one to put up with his shit. She's also a lawyer. If they separate, she is prepared to make any visitation with his kids contingent upon him not drinking while they are with him, which he won't/can't do. She is not doing this out of spite, she is truly concerned about their well-being, and I think it's not an unfounded concern. I would not put it past him to drive with them in the car when he's been drinking. It's also just really shitty for them to have to be around that. Pretty embarrassing for a 10 year old when their dad is at a baseball game in the middle of the afternoon, smelling like a distillery, and probably asleep.

So this all breaks my heart. My heart especially breaks for my nephews. But I have a feeling he will take no responsibility if he doesn't get to see them. I'm sure it will all be my SIL's fault because she's the one who won't let him see them. He'll make it out like he's the victim, even though he could totally see his kids if he just didn't drink. I guess my question is, is there any way I can get him to realize that drinking is not more important than your kids and family? Is there any way I can just slap some sense in him and get him to wake up and realize that he's about to lose everything?",2

I definitely have mental illness struggles, I‚Äôve tried countless medications and therapists and was hospitalized... actually after that one hospitalization I felt so strong and me and ready to take on the work for myself.. but then I fell back into drinking to deal with my emotions and not feel lonely.

I dont have the energy to type more details, except to ask for advice on my next problem. I have to start a job on Monday. I am completely physically and emotionally dependent on alcohol right now. I have 2 days to stop the dry heaving, nausea, insomnia, crying, so that I can attempt to fix my life. Not to mention my relationship is over, although I‚Äôm still living here for now, so crazy increased anxiety and tears, although he‚Äôs being very supportive and just wants me to be happy. Anyway I need quick coping ideas to make it through the side effects while I try to focus and get on a normal schedule, for both my body and mind. I am out of options and I have to do this.

I am young, very young, not like, kid young, but definitely a year or two, or three under the legal drinking age. As a kid I always saw my parents, especially my mother, drunk out of her mind on these week/month benders and binges, she became this person, this monster that I hated, and as I was growing up I told myself that I'd never be that. That I'd never try alcohol, and if I did, I wouldn't do it for the purpose of getting drunk. I still never have. I've never really Drank a drink. (Drunk? Drinked?)

But as I'm growing up, I find myself not exactly curious, but yearning for this feeling to get drunk and forget everything that.. I've never felt, but it almost seems, familiar? Like I'm trying to chase a dragon I've never seen. 

My family on both sides have had a serious history with addiction, and I always told myself that I'd never become them, these monsters that threw themselves down stairs and attacked their family with zero consequences. 

I feel like I'm dragging and rambling so I'll just jump to the point. I'm not them. I'm my own person and I know that what they did is not a guarantee of what would happen if I were to drink. But should I even risk it regarding everything? I keep feeling the urge to, but then the memories come floating back, and then the reassurance that I'm not like that. But then again, how would I know what I'm like when I'm drunk?

I'm sure this entire post makes zero sense, but if someone has some sort of, I don't know, words of reassurance that what I'm feeling isn't weird, or even words of affirmation that it's completely strange and I sound like a hermit drifting down a river in a leaf canoe, talking to himself, wondering why no one will answer him back. That'd be nice too.

Thank you.",5

I'm a 16 yo girl and I dont know what to do. My dad has an alcohol problem. I dont know for sure if hes an alcoholic, but its obvious that hes drinking way more than is healthy. I really try to understand why he drinks, I really do but its hard. He always gets annoyed when I beg him to quit or drink less. He changes completely every single evening and its honestly heartbreaking. It makes me feel sad and furious but most of all I'm scared. I know that it's bad for his health and I just dont want to lose my dad. :(

I guess I just wanted to ask what motivates people to change their ways because I have tried everything at this point. Being mad, begging, crying, asking... but nothing really seems to work. He often says that he is a grown adult and doesnt have to listen to me. And its true that I cant stop him, but its like he doesnt see how much it hurts me. It is taking a toll on my mental health as well. I always feel a rush of anxiety whenever I hear him opening and taking another bottle, like I feel like I have to throw up. Its also really weird because hes totally different during the day and hes the best dad ever, but at the same time I know that thats only temporary and at the end of the day he will just choose the bottle again. 

To everyone trying to better themselves on here; I am so proud of you for trying, yall deserve the world. :)

Here‚Äôs my update:

left my home and am staying with family

Already had Valium on hand and using it

So far I‚Äôm okay, but my chronic pain condition is worse. I guess the alcohol was numbing it to some degree.

Bowels are slow and I have a massive headache. Also had an emotional outburst yesterday.

One day at a time.

If you are suffering my first recommendation is to remove yourself from your drinking environment if you can....For me being alone and in pain got me drinking. Going to stay in a supportive place has worked for me so far

If this doesn‚Äôt ultimately work for me I‚Äôll
go to official detox.",2

I have been drinking a lot and depressed to new lows than ever lately. How do I get motivation to stop? I want to quit today but my resolve is already wearing down. Like I'm already tempted to say fuck it for the millionth time and go to the store and get what I want so I have something to look forward to today, but I also know it's adding to my misery. I can't seem to find much in life that I can look forward to besides drinking anymore.

I have tried AA twice in the past and I couldn't stand it, it was not for me, the meetings in my area i found cliquey and I changed sponsors 3 times because each one I felt too judged by. I also probably revealed a bit too much about myself in my first meetings while detoxing and think that might be way the community did not feel welcoming at all to me. 

Anyway I have no idea where to start on my own. A lot of things have gone wrong in my life lately some related to drinking some just because of bad luck, but I'm sick of being depressed and I do want to see if stopping drinking will help as my 24-day run I had a couple times before did seem to make me feel better. Just want to try something new. I don't have friends for support and my partner used to be my best friend but they also changed their personality and isn't nice to me anymore and we havent seen each other in a while and I'm pretty certain it's over any day now. Doesn't really matter because it was a person I really thought understood and admired me and I don't feel like he's a person I can identify with anymore anyway, we just aren't close anymore and he lost interest in me recently so that also has been very hard on me and making me want to drink even more.

 I am lonely and get suicidal but I very seriously thought about killing myself and how I would do it on and off over the past couple years. More so lately than ever before. But i also have a young daughter and can't do that to her, I don't want it to affect her. She actually thinks I'm cool and I love to read to her and play with her a lot of the time but I notice it takes so much for me to even make myself be a good mom to her and I don't want to feel that way anymore. I feel kinda stuck in life obligated to live it whether I like it or not. so now i came to the conclusion that if i have to be here, I might as well see if I can fix anything even though it feels hopeless.

I see that many people on here seem to have good stories so maybe some tips or something? I dunno. its like I need to find the desire to have the desire to stop if that makes sense. I will also read more posts today to hopefully get some inspiration and stop thinking about my own stuff so much.

I generally drink like 6-8 drinks a night and get down to 3-4 on a good night. But I dont really eat more than a few snacks besides that intake so I do get pretty drunk but I also think it's a level I can safely detox from on my own. I've detoxed before while at an average more like 9-12 a day.",1

&#x200B;

I'm basically looking for help on how to help my mom, who's usually very kind and understanding, but also an alcoholic. We are from Germany so beer consumption is probably higher on average than in the US or other countries, but she is drinking way too much. Every once in a while she has a week where she drinks up to 3 crates of beer (that's roughly 60 bottles, 0,5 liters each) which is way too much. My dad also drinks, and surely he could drink less, but I feel like he is in control, composed and constantly drinking. Another thing is that my mom eats very little, so the alcohol that's consumed on an empty stomach hits even harder. Her drinking habits often lead to fights within the family, be it at the dinner-table or when I come home after being at a friend's place. She is often really aggressive, trying to start a fight (not physically, at least not yet). She often comes to me when I'm back in my room after a fight, sometimes to apologize and to say she doesn't want to fight, sometimes just to continue arguing. 

&#x200B;

Here's some background on my mom, I don't know what's relevant, but maybe something helps: My mom has a really hard time saying ""no"". She also doesn't have any vacation, because she works at small companies and is the only one doing certain tasks. Because of that she can never have a week or so off, because the work would pile up etc. She also can't say ""Screw it, I'll take a week off, every company has to continue working, even if the office lady isn't there. So the comapny I'm working at will have to do the same for a week"". At home she cleans very very much, my father and I do very little to no cleaning around the house, partly because in our eyes there is nothing to clean and because we can't clean well enough for the standards of my mum. We live in a pretty big house, so there's lots of cleaning work to be done, but cleaning such a big house excessively is an incredible amount of work and takes very long. Just to reiterate how clean our place is: the glass is always in perfect condition, no smear, dirt, or dust, just perfectly clear and I honestly wouldn't mind eating of the floor, simply because it is that clean. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm hoping I can get some help from this community. What can me and my dad do? I was mainly raised by my mom as she spent way more time with me, than my dad who has an odd working schedule. As a kid I always thought my mom is the one of my parents who's right and my dad isn't handling things well, growing up I realised it's the other way around. I'm 21 now and never spent too much time with my dad, but hearing his side of the past and also observing the situation at home myself and not going blindly by what my mom says, I can really tell she is addicted and that addiction is the reason for so many problems in our family. My dad went to see a psychiatrist when he had some mental issues and looking back, I think that helped him immensely. My mother doesn't think the professional help helped my dad at all and even made things worse. She sometimes has a know-it-all-attitide, thoroughly believing that psychiatrist are often giving bad advice and don't actually know anything. So for tight now, suggesting professional help isn't a good idea in my opinion. When steps in the right direction have been made and her views change, professional help is absolutely advisable though. When you talk to her about her drinking habits, she often says it's not that bad, my dad drinks just as much (which is not true), denies it in other ways or shifts blame on others. How should me and my dad act and how can we help her?",4

What do i do?,"As the title says my dads drinking has got way out of hand, i‚Äôm talking mixing spirits and bourbons with his beers. He will drink a case of six desperados a day without fail since Jan 2020, as some of you may know desperados is one of the higher ABV beers at about 6% per bottle. When i say ‚Äúday‚Äù i mean within the span of around 5 hours (after work till bedtime). For the past month he‚Äôs been mixing his beers with very high ABV drinks like vodka, jack daniels and the one i‚Äôm most worried about, wray & nephew (63% Alc Jamaican Rum).

I‚Äôm yet to reach the worst of it.

He has successfully gone sober for many small periods of times, the longest i recall was the whole year of 2017. Everyone in my family (Mother Brother and Myself) recognises his drinking as a problem, we have confronted him about it multiple times but he always blows it off as a joke or something novel. I know for a fact he has recognised his drinking as a problem because he slyly tries to spread his empty bottles between normal bin and recycling (where all bottles go), my mum asked him ‚Äúwhy are you throwing so many bottles in the bin and not the recycling‚Äù, his reply: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want the neighbours seeing how much i drink everyday‚Äù, followed by a laugh and a rapid change of topic.

Now that you know the attributes to his Alcoholism...

This is the part that truly wrenches our hearts, he has been diagnosed with dangerously high blood pressure (HBP), where his doctor has prescribed double the recommended dose of HBP tablets (which he fails to take a lot of the time, says he ‚Äúforgets‚Äù), his mother, my grandmother died last year and i still catch him crying late at night in the downstairs toilet, he‚Äôs very proud and i can‚Äôt build up courage to confront him about being suicidal, when i say suicidal i mean the neglect for his own life, not necessarily the textbook meaning, he is blind in one eye, he‚Äôs at risk of glaucoma which plays a huge roll in his HBP, he‚Äôs been told numerous times not to consume alcohol by his doctor, he lies to his doctors about drinking and smoking (smoking started around May 2020 and he hasn‚Äôt smoked since 2009). He is fully aware of the dangers of HBP, heart attack, stroke and death.

He‚Äôs not abusive, if anything it‚Äôs small amounts of verbal abuse, when sober he‚Äôs fun, nice, caring, fair, level headed. Substance abuse runs in our family, his father drank himself to death in 1989, his sister and her husband are heroin addicts, his youngest brother is on the very severe side of the alcoholic spectrum to the point where everyone has given up on him including his mental health counsellor and doctors, his other sister suffers from similar alcoholism as he does but she‚Äôs in pubs everyday so it‚Äôs just that little bit worse.

I believe i have a role to play in his alcoholism, i was kicked out of my house early this year and went homeless for about 3 weeks, i‚Äôm sure he was worried sick, both my parents were too strict with me (i‚Äôll be 19 in a month), they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to leave my house if i haven‚Äôt told them: who i‚Äôm going with, where i‚Äôm going, what time i‚Äôll be back, what i‚Äôll be doing there and worst of all i tell them a time and they‚Äôll change it to an earlier one. I had to break free of that, i believe he was very surprised even disappointed when i came home from homelessness happy and joyful, to him it seemed like i didn‚Äôt need parents anymore (which is not the case).

I feel trapped in this feeling of care, that i really really do want to help in any way but somethings also telling me to stay out of his way and try to have the least interactions with him as possible. It‚Äôs very confusing.",4

Ever since the pandemic hit america, my partner (we are both F25 currently) has been affected by it. She was firstly furloughed, and then later fully fired. Luckily, she has computer skills which are coveted by many, so she found a new job a month after she was officially fired. (I am currently doing housewife work, but I hope to find a job by the end of the year.)

Problem is. We've been drinking every day pretty much all year long because of the bullshit in life happening this year. We realized that, ""hey this is probably not good at all, we should do something about this,"" a couple weeks into july -- she started her new job at the beginning of july. 

Long story short, she had auditory hallucinations, and then had two seizures from alcohol withdrawal. The second seizure I flipped out and called 911 (I wasn't really there for the first one, so she convinced me I was seeing things. Not her fault. She had had a seizure. She didn't know what was happening.) (Tbh I've been drinking a lot less than her, but 3 drinks a day every day is still a lot, I know.) 

So now I/we have multiple issues/problems. We now have a a 2.7$k deductible we owe, from a 12k bill from her ER visit last week. If anyone has any help to make that not so absurd, I would love your input. I figure we can create a payment plan, but I'm very confused as to how insurance plays into affect here, since the bill is so large and it seems like no matter what we'll have to pay the entire deductible for this one night.

I hope to get her to an actual specialist therapist by the end of fall, but she's been doing good ever since the ER visit. 

We haven't actually received a bill from the hospital, as far as I can tell, this is the EOB from her insurance, although I'm quite confused as to when or if I will receive something from the hospital themselves.

Any suggestions or helpful thoughs or words? I would really appreciate it.",2

He pays $500 to my mom a month while he works full time (40hrs) and she works part time. He doesn't give a shit about giving my mom more money either a month, he'll complain if she ever asked.

My sister thinks he's doing this so people at work can tell he is, so he can get fired. As he complains all the time about how his work is boring. 

So is 14 cans of beer accepted in 5 hours? Why would someone start drinking more all of a sudden?",3

Brain feels so slow in addition to this.

Is there something I could do to help aid the rehab process? Or supplements maybe?

But to preface, my drinking was pretty heavy. Typically a 1.75 of vodka every weekend, and 12-15 drinks a day for many months. In fact, I've had on-and-off phases of this for multiple years. Really wanting to stay clean for good this time as it's bothering me how much drinking is affecting my work ability.

This is my first attempt at quitting- I want to eventually be able to drink a few drinks without downing an entire bottle (idk if that‚Äôs even possible for me), but for now I know I have to go cold turkey. I‚Äôm also aware that there are some risks associated with going cold turkey but I know that I cannot monitor my drinking so as to slowly reduce my intake- I can‚Äôt stop once I start. 

Can anyone tell me what withdrawal will be like, and how to help the cravings? I‚Äôm using Naltrexone right now to help on the side, but I know that won‚Äôt help with the withdrawal symptoms. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated- thank you!",1

The day after taking vyvanse/binge drinking I‚Äôm too hungover/anxious to even take my vyvanse so I just suffer through work with a severe hangover and take my anxiety meds. And then the next day I do it all over again- vyvanse, binge drink. I‚Äôve talked to my psychiatrist about this and he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the vyvanse that‚Äôs causing my urge to drink because I‚Äôve been taking it for so long and I never had this issue when I first started taking vyvanse. I went to AA meetings, was prescribed a ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù med, etc. Neither of those things worked. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, the days I don‚Äôt take vyvanse, I literally have zero urge to drink. I‚Äôm usually hungover on the days I don‚Äôt take vyvanse but I‚Äôve tested this- I‚Äôve gone days without taking vyvanse and I don‚Äôt have a single sip of alcohol, I just don‚Äôt have that urge/need to. This is why I feel like vyvanse/ADHD medication is the direct cause of my alcoholism. I‚Äôve tried other ADHD meds and I still binge drink every other day. I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with this toxic cycle. I need to take vyvanse because it acts as an antidepressant for me. I‚Äôve tried a few different antidepressants but had to stop taking them because they weren‚Äôt helping me.

I'm 20 years old and I've been sober for a year, two if you don't count a suicide attempt last summer

I started drinking at maybe 15? I'm not totally sure, 14-18 are a complete blur for many reasons, used to be that I'd go with friends, I was never much of a party person but I guess things just progressed that way

When I was 17 I moved to my dad's place away from an abusive mother and met great new people and we'd also go out to drink except they'd get a bottle of beer and I'd get a bottle of vodka, you know the cheap ones behind the counter at most supermarkets

It progressed to a point where I started to want to drink alone especially if I was depressed, which was most of the time back then and I was lucky I didn't have alcohol in the house

Decided to stop when I was 18 and quit cold turkey but I still get the taste of vodka or cheap whiskey in the back of my throat on particularly bad days

Today I'm still not really able to be responsible around a crowd of drinkers and I always sorta ruin the mood when I tell new people I don't drink

I'm not totally sure where I'm going with this, I was never a particularly heavy drinker and my tolerance is pretty high apparently

Is that alcoholism? Is it something else? I really don't know what to say or call myself, I usually just say I've had issues with the stuff and leave it at that

Doc sent me for colonscope which didn‚Äôt show anything wrong. Was told I had IBS

One day I realized that damn all this pain started following a long course of antibiotics and the beginning of drinking

Anyways recent blood tests show high liver markers and I‚Äôve got pain under my right rib

I had an ultrasound 2 weeks ago

No comment from doctor on blood test or ultrasound....not sure why...

Bottom line the toll of alcohol goes far beyond being drunk and disappointment in yourself

He loved to get hammered in school, and now it seems like he has crossed the Rubicon.

His eyes were red, and they had that glazed over look of a hard drinker.

We're in our mid-30's now, and he had a meeting at 8am the next morning.

The last time I saw him was about a year ago, and he was pounding back mixed drinks like nobody's business, and making \*very\* angry, hostile comments. The comments were dripping with hate.

He also put on a solid 20-30 lbs since that last meeting.

However we‚Äôve grown a bit (we‚Äôre all early to mid twenties now) and we‚Äôve gotten past the black out drunk phase of life especially with coronavirus occurring. However, one of my friends seems to be still drinking quite significantly at home. She drinks what seems like every day and often talks about how it‚Äôs one of her favourite activities. She is not working, studying or really doing anything which I think makes the situation worse ‚Äî I think for her drinking is one of her main life activities at the moment. She often texts in the evening about how she is drunk and gets very aggressive when drunk. She already has anger issues and drinking only exasperates it. 

I worry that she may be depressed about not having much going on and turning to drinking to cope. I also worry that my other friends encourage it; they joke a lot about drinking to cope and drinking every evening but I know they don‚Äôt do it to the extent she does. They also have jobs/college/partners. I recently had to call them out for saying it‚Äôs okay to get a drinking problem during lockdown and ‚Äújust deal with it when lockdown is over.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs a really bad example to give to our friend but they probably haven‚Äôt realised the extent to which this is a problem.

And I always felt guilty after so I would drink more to numb the guilt. 
Finally one night I bought some everclear and started drinking that straight. I was so absolutely drunk that I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed to puke. So I slept in a bed full of puke all night. I remember still to this day that there was a strange apparition or ghost or spirit or something in the room with me. He was praying over me or something very bizarre, but it wasn‚Äôt good prayer, it felt evil and in a different language. Even though it was evil, I felt comforted and safe. 
I have been in and out of rehab, AA, counselling, sponsors, sober groups, blah blah blah and have made a year sober a couple times. I have however resigned that I was designed to be an addict and drinking is the only thing that makes me happy. I have built and lost everything so many times that I don‚Äôt really have feelings anymore. I am just blank. I have no friends and I rarely talk to my family. I am divorced and threw out all my things just in spite. My life accomplishments and pictures and books, etc. The only person who means anything to me is my little girl and no one gives a shit if I see her or not. I am learning to let her go too. I don‚Äôt even think I am a human anymore. Just a thing that exists. 
Oh well, I think this is a brain disease and the only efforts I make now is to try not to drink too much. However, I know that one day again I will and probably end up in jail or dead. 
Well. Peace out.",6

I struggle with the fact that after 6-8  2oz drinks I feel cheerful and reenergized. I can to the dishes, laundry or vacuuming without a problem. I can take down a 26'er and still stand up straight.

The real problem is I've just about drank myself into homelessness. My car is nearly out of commission and I cant really afford my rent anymore. This is embarrassing and really humiliating.  (BTW ps No I do not drive once I've had 1 drink)

As I turned the knob, I realized where I was going. I was going to the liquor store. I wanted to get rid of this feeling and I subconsciously got up to go buy some beer. I sat back down and looked at my hands, they were shaky and my hands normally shake a little bit but this was a small step above that.

I (22F) think I have a problem with alcohol. I haven't been diagnosed nor want to call myself an alcoholic (not even a high-functioning one) because I feel like it would undermine people whose struggles with drinking are bigger than mine, but lately I feel like I need some help.

I don't go out as much as other summers because of covid but when I do I don't know when to stop drinking and I always black out and when I wake up in the morning I feel soooo embarrassed over the stuff I have done that I can remember. The last straw has been blacking out twice in one day and then my older brother's best friend (I went out with him and his friends) calling me to let me know what I did. I feel like shit and have been feeling quite depressed lately (this is not alcohol related), so this only worsens it. This hasn't only happened in the summer but this past year too - I went on a study abroad to the US and done things that I don't even want to think about.

I guess I just need advice on how to deal with this. I turn to alcohol when I go out (I love partying and I'm still in college so I go out almost every weekend) because I'm relatively shy. I wouldn't say that I don't know how to have fun sober but it def helps me loosen up and socialize with people I don't know that well. I also drink alone sometimes because I actually enjoy the feeling of being drunk, it makes me forget about my problems. But then I wake up in the morning and feel like shit. Also during the year I skip class sometimes because I get drunk on the weekdays.

Any tips on how to quit drinking altogether (or maybe I should just learn to stop??) when in your 20's, specially when going out or surrounded by people who drink?",2

My sister is 2 years younger than me. She's been an alcoholic for years now, and things are only getting worse. I assumed they got better last year, because her boyfriend threatened to leave her if she didn't get help. She promised to stop drinking alone, and to stop getting drunk. She could still drink in social settings - I thought that was insufficient, but because I don't live close by and don't see her often, I thought maybe it had worked.

Turns out, nope. I found out recently from a friend of hers that it's in fact only gotten much worse. Her friends have held interventions for her, her boyfriend left her and came back, and she's had no job or studies for the past year. My parents are at their wits end, and so am I, especially given that she and I are moving into a flat together next year, and I know she gets violent when drunk. She used to beat me up as a child, and I'm scared this time she'll really break some bones.

Here's the thing. She knows what the problem is. But she refuses to get help. I've offered to take her to AA, but she doesn't want to because it'd ""bum her out"" (no shit). She ""doesn't believe"" in therapy, and, what's more, she still hasn't settled her issues with our healthcare system (universal healthcare), so she has no cover for the time being. My parents live very far and don't really know how to handle it.

I'm desperate at this point. What can I do? I have no experience dealing with addiction in others. It's probably selfish of me, but I can't risk her ruining my last year of uni for me or physically hurting me. I also do not have the means to support her financially, as I rely on precisely calculated loans for my expenses and tuition, and I'm getting worried she'll just eat my food and steal my things. I've tried helping her for years, and it has done absolutely nothing. I'd like to help her get the help and care she needs, but I also want to protect myself. I also can't back out of the move in the apartment next year, it's 100% not feasible for me. 

What can I do? Who can I turn to?

For reference, I do not live in the US, and therefore have no access to the services provided there for alcoholics. I hope I didn't write anything offensive, but if I have, please let me know and I'll make changes where appropriate.",2

I've been thinking about the way I drink for a few months now and I'm wondering if its the right time to get help or whether I'm just being dramatic. 

Basically, I started drinking when I was sad at age 13. Back then it would only be 1, just to make me feel better,  and it worked. But I think I was in reality doing some prep work - a kid who drinks when they're sad is gonna become an adult who drinks when they're depressed, right?

I developed severe depression at 15 which I have been managing ever since. Its impacted every aspect of my life. I carried on drinking in the same way occasionally to help out, but I was on a lot of different medications then so I didn't go as far as I wanted to, as to avoid chemical interactions. When I became an adult (18 in uk), my usage changed a bit. I stopped taking antidepressants at this time because none of them worked, and as I was older, I had more access to alcohol than ever before. I had spells of binge drinking when I got really down, one time I overdid it by drinking every night consecutively for a few days. That incident scared me off of alcohol 'forever' (2 months). At the time these binges weren't too frequent so I didn't think much of it.

This year however, has been a little different. My stress has been off the charts (I'm sure yours has been too). In May I did some more frequent drinking, and I noticed how amazing I felt. My mood was great. My anxiety was gone. I could function normally. My brain came to the conclusion that I no longer wanted to be sober, and then everything changed. The pursuit began. Alcohol became  on my mind 24/7. Nothing brought me joy anymore. I'd try to do things but nothing would hit. And each time I drank, it became more than last time. I knew something was off then, but I always argued with myself. ""You don't have a problem because you haven't done xyz"", then a week later I'd end up doing xyz. Each time it would escalate a bit more, and im finding it difficult to stop once I start. My mother has stopped buying any alcohol for me because she found out what I was up to. I've always drank alone but now I have become more secretive than ever. I don't want to hurt her feelings. 

But I'm still not sure if I have a problem. There's no way I developed it that fast, right? It was like a switch was flipped - I thought it was a gradual process that people took years to even recognise they were even in, and I'm somehow here at the snap of a finger? Or what if I'm not, and my brain is making up the whole thing?

I can also go weeks without alcohol, but the longer it becomes, the more I want it again. I can't afford to buy a  lot so I have these gaps. I feel like if I had more money (and there was no covid) I would be using more frequently.

Is it time for something to intervene? I have been thinking about buying some books just to help when it gets in my head, or maybe looking at a meeting or something, but I feel like I'm not bad enough to deserve help. Maybe I don't need help and I'm just being silly and over the top?

Thanks for your time reading this post.",6
2020-08-17 04:39:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ibadz8/gave_up_booze_in_january/,Gave up booze in January,"I'm currently in a dilemma and would be interested to know what people think. I decided to give up the booze for a year to see if I could, and whether or not it would help my frame of mind. So far, so good.

Like a lot of Brits, alcohol has featured heavily in just about every social occasion I've ever had since childhood. My mother was a high functioning alcoholic, which was often a source of great anguish for me and my sisters. My uncle is in the hospital with early-onset alcohol-related dementia in his 50s. I also worry about my aunts drinking.

I, my sisters and all my cousins love a good party. So does my wife. But I felt myself relying on it a bit too much. Nothing extraordinary, a few bottles of red and a few beers most weekends. A rare night out with friends always involves getting mashed and a terrible hangover.

2019 was terrible, lost my mum to cancer, my business and marriage weren't doing great. Started to feel the need to drink most evenings. The wife would often get judgy, anxious about it. 'On your second beer already etc.' given the issues my mum had.

So after indulging a lot at Christmas and pondering, I decided to give sobriety a go. It was surprisingly easy except for the judgyness, questions and surprise from family and friends.

I do miss it. It's my birthday next month, and I was contemplating some fizz to celebrate. But I'm worried that this might be a mistake. My family history would suggest that I also have the gene. It's sad, but I'm coming to the conclusion that I might never get to enjoy alcohol again.

Is it possible to keep a lid on it, even if you doubt yourself? Or should I just stay on this path and quit it all together?

Thanks",4

I definitely used it as a way to cope with anxiety, but it got to the point where I if couldn't have a little every hour, I'd start getting horrifyingly anxious. I couldn't even get through a full night of sleep without waking up for a fix. I had to get plastered to even feel okay, but then how am I going to live my whole life that way? I'm falling behind on the little work I do from home, and I've basically disappeared socially. 

Starting today, I'm going sober. I weaned for a few days, but the feeling of doom is unstoppable. I can't even read a book or have coherent thoughts, it all just gets eaten by anxiety. I just lie there staring at the ceiling. The only good thing is that my partner is also going sober with me, and we've been taking care of each other with food, water, walks, etc.

He cannot go one relaxing day sober. He comes home on his payday broke because his paycheck goes to the liquor store in the corner for all the money he owes that week for the beer he‚Äôs taken. It‚Äôs a weekly cycle that never stops. 
When I try to talk to him about it and how much it hurts me to see him this way he doesn‚Äôt care and thinks it‚Äôs a joke. He laughs and says we are all going to die so might as well enjoy life. Another important note is that my brother was a gang member in high school who was in and out of juvenile hall and at one point was in the hospital fighting for his life because he was shot at. So now when my mom and I confront him he thinks we should be happy he is the way he is because at least he is no longer in the streets or in jail. 

What hurts the most is seeing the stress he puts my mom in. I‚Äôm 5 years younger then him, going to my third year of university, and I‚Äôve been working part time since 16 to help with rent. It‚Äôs frustrating to work so hard and help out with rent just to see him come home empty handed on a pay day. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I cry at night thinking he probably won‚Äôt make it past his 30th birthday.",5

I went without a drop for a couple months and then once I was happier with my weight and felt like alcohol wasn't really a problem I would have a beer from time to time. I felt generally okay mentally although that's hard to say for sure as I have lots of anxiety and depression unrelated to alcoholism but I was doing alright. 

Fast forward to the end of July I went on a one-week vacation to Colorado and I had a couple beers pretty much every night and one night I would say I even got a little drunk probably for the first time since last year. I noticed how bad I felt coming home from this vacation and decided to try completely cutting out alcohol once again and I have been an absolute emotional wreck. My last drink was probably right around the 1st of this month and I have not been feeling good mentally almost feel like I'm going to have a mental breakdown of sorts. I know that the hardest parts of alcohol withdrawal are said to happen around the 10 day or two week period which would be where I am right now and it would explain a lot. But it could also be the issues that I said I deal with separate from alcoholism. Anxiety is a huge problem for me and with everything going on in the news that might be part of it too. 

All I know is that I'm extremely irritable, my anxiety and depression are through the roof, and I just don't feel like I have much energy. 

Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated

Tl;Dr - Cut out alcohol at the beginning of the year, went a few months without it, then cut loose a little on vacation at the end of July and drank a little every day for 5 days. Cut alcohol out again August 1st and currently am going through a very tough emotional time.",1

(There may be some online gaming friendships there so that could actually be a positive) He limits his interactions with my parents as much as possible and eats all of his meals alone in his room.

We thought it was a wake up call when he rolled his car while driving drunk. He somehow walked away from that with just a scratch. He stayed sober for about a month after the crash. He has tried AA maybe once and a church recovery group once but as a video call meeting due to COVID. Since starting to drink again he has driven drunk on more than one occasion.

My parents try to be supportive and want him to take steps to recovery but they feel like they have tried everything with no success. They are worried they are enabling him by letting him live with them. But we don‚Äôt know where he would go if they kicked him out. 

It doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to talk about it when I try to bring it up. He either downplays the matter or keeps responses brief and moves on to another topic.

Anyone with similar experience/advice on how to best support him would be appreciated.",4

I read a book called The Freedom Model and woah. It told me I always have a choice. The Addiction Solution podcast has a lot of great discussion from former AA old timers.

In the rooms I was told to sit down and shut up, here's some things to say, every day you could fall victim to your own flaws and misdeeds.

After reading I bought a bottle of wine. I wanted to. I told myself I had to fully reason out why I wanted any at all. To unwind. Fine. Later on instead of racing to the fridge I asked ""what is the benefit of having more?""

I put it away. Having more would not achieve what I wanted from it. And it would cost a lot more.

And smoked a little weed. Sorry not sorry. I woke up this morning on top of the world. No shame, no secret, no fear. It's a beautiful day to boot.

Altered consciousness is not inherently bad. Doing things you don't really want to do, is.

In my glee I wrote a post on SD and it got taken down lol. I truly believe the victim self image perpetuated my issue. I never drank more until attending AA. So just explaining that radical honesty is a way out.

I‚Äôve read that alcohol increases appetite and the withdrawal from it decreasing appetite. It‚Äôs been the opposite for me! For about a year and a half, I was drinking consistently, having a minimum of 3 cocktails each night, but usually having closer to 8.

It's been an intense few weeks.

Stopped taking Citalopram. Mood swings, brain zaps, nausea, vivid dreams, agitation. Pleasure, memory, anger, frustration, despair, ecstasy.

I don't think the  words exist to truly capture it. Rapturous catharsis. It's like meeting myself all over again. Parts of me that existed in feelings and thoughts that were so far away away, so utterly inaccessible, that I forgot they existed entirely.

I'm still me, but more me. Me but more nuanced. I can go deeper. Resonation doesn't just hit my chest, it pours down my body and ping pongs off my toes and comes shooting back out my mouth. Completely different but utterly the same.

I saw *Inception* in the cinema. Tenth anniversary thing. I hadn't been to the cinema since they started reopening - *Jojo Rabbit* was the last thing I saw, I think. Never got around to catching *Parasite* before the world ended. Anyway, *Inception* hit me like a freight train. I could hardly stop crying. It welled up in me in waves, but as the movie went on I caught the themes that passed me by as a teenager. Legacy, losing a parent, regret, catharsis, transformation, inspiration and change.

I needed one more conversation with my father before he died. He never got my postcard. It arrived the morning of his funeral. He wanted to speak to me - there was a reminder in his phone. But he died. I didn't go to see his body. I wish I had.

None of that can ever change, and you know what that is? A fucking tragedy. A full on, Greek-style tragedy. I'm never going to know what he wanted to say. I'm never going to know what exactly happened the night he died. Or what he thought and felt.

But I do know he suffered. Technically he died of a heart attack, but really he died of a myriad of physical problems caused by his alcoholism. And his alcoholism was caused by pain. Excruciating pain he could not live with, pain which he drowned out with alcohol, causing himself more suffering in the process. He killed himself slowly over more that 30 years.

Pain like that can never truly go away. He finally stopped feeling it after breathing his last breath, but it's not gone. It didn't go away when his body was burnt to ashes or when we buried those ashes and planted an oak tree over them.

I truly don't believe there is any escaping your parents. Nothing can ever change anything that which happened before. I'm obviously terrified of living my father's story out myself. I'm definitely dependant on alcohol. It's a fundamental part of how I engage with my life. I have not gone a week without drinking without very actively choosing to do so in more than 9 years. My hangovers are more or less a weekly ritual and they're getting worse. My body does not feel good. I feel it in my thumping heart, my dry mouth, my throat and lungs aching from all the cigarettes. I struggle to think and smile. I am hurting myself, inside and out. I am afraid that I'm already walking down the path of slow, painful suicide. I don't want it, but I think part of me feels that I deserve it. And that it's inevitable.

After the cinema I cried to my friend. I explained that I wasn't prepared for what it would bring up in me. She was understanding. I asked her not to be alarmed and we both agreed that grief come in different forms, in different stages, at different times. I turned down her offer to talk about it more. We were in public and I literally physically couldn't talk about it more - I would have just kept crying uncontrollably.

We made small talk about face masks and had a cigarette and then I went home. I cried on the way to the bus, on the bus, on the walk home and in my room. I am so glad we didn't go for a drink because I would have gotten drunk. I wouldn't have stopped until my body stopped.

When I got home I cried more. I made the bed and I cried. I crouched on the floor crying. I listened to some music and had a cigarette out the window. Then I meditated for the first time since I started taking antidepressants more than two years ago. I picked up a book - because I wanted to, not because I felt like I should - Haruki Murakami. His words feel like home.",5

one thought at a time is more like it...

&#x200B;

 

It's funny how much i didn't pay attention to when i was drinking every single day. Theres just overwhelming need to get the fuck away from being completely conscious and mindful of the world around me. Of my own thoughts, about myself, about my peers. The worst part was the willful and ignorant disregard towards my son.

I just really need to ignore those thoughts that i'll live with for the rest of my life thoughts ‚Äúhey bud. It won't hurt any. Just go get you some and cut loose‚Äù ‚ÄúHow much money do we have? Shit that's totally enough‚Äù ‚ÄúLook at them, they're doing it!!‚Äù

God i wish you would just shut up, and leave me the fuck alone. I have the ability to actually accomplish all the things in my life that i want and the only way i'm going to do that is get off my ass and do them. I just made the mistake of inviting you along with me. If i have to spend the rest of my life with you in my head then i want you to spend the rest of my life suffering and losing. You were the worst mistake I've made in my life so far and this is where I make the choice. The choice to better myself, to do the things that aren't exciting or curious but the things that will keep me healthy so i can achieve all the things that i was meant for. I will hold my head high above a crowd and the people will cheer my name.

Are you a blessing or a curse? I've always said that the reason I seem so grounded is because of the shitty state of my upbringing and the garbage setting that it took place in. id go so far as to say that you are ever worse than those circumstances, making them seem pleasant in comparison‚Ä¶ So in that respect, are you the catalyst that pushes me across the threshold? Are you the driving force that is the make or break of me? If I succumb you don't necessarily win. If I die then you die. So do you take the guise of a demon but maintain the intention of the righteous? The further you push me to destroy myself, depending on the choices I make, can inspire me to spring my gifts and my mind onto the people in this world that I could inspire, the people that can relate to me. The ones that need to see that it's not impossible to stand up to you. To make you suffer as we have suffered.

You posses the rivers of my mind

You creep through every rock of sanity

You tarnish every leaf of prosperity

The stench you bear clouds my judgement

I want to rid myself of your noxious torment

That it seems, is impossible.

So i'll use your possessive nature to my advantage

And my mind will be a spring

You'll creep through and find the bedrock of my strength 

Leaving my sanity intact

The leaves you've left tarnished will stay by the new

Flourishing and prosperous with change

Your foul odor will linger no longer

By the refreshing wind of clear judgement

I'm glad that you're here

Because of you, I will do the impossible.",5

I am 19 and have struggled with substance abuse in the past drinking anywhere from 10-20 shots a day while also taking xanax and cocaine. Over the course of a year I was taking xanax and drinking this much nearly everyday without break despite my consequences. I wanted to stop but I could not. Because of my inability to stop I checked myself into rehab for 3 months and dealt with my real underlying issues such as my depression. Over the course of this year since I have been out of rehab I have been drinking casually, maybe 3-5 beers every other week, and have no cravings and feel no compulsion to drink during the day. Is this denial or is it really possible that I may be able to drink in moderation now. I am not depressed anymore so I feel no real urges and often am more than willing to DD my friends. I have been living a happy life and am fully pursuing my passions. I also have not taken any drugs other than alcohol and occasionally nicotine since rehab.

Life is happier without her, so why am I crying?","Today is the 3rd anniversary of my alcoholic mother's death. Since then no-one has screamed in my face, called me names or generally made my life miserable and difficult.

My life is easier now, happier even. Then why do I hurt so much? 

No one questions my sadness  because any normal person would be sad on the anniversary of their mum's death, but they don't seem to understand and they look at me shocked when I tell him I don't miss her. I just miss the idea of her, the idea of having a mum. But the reality is I didn't really have a mum. My sisters looked after me till I was 8 then they went to University and then I was left to my own devises after that. 

I think that while she was alive I could keep hoping that one day if I tried hard enough I would be able to help her to stop drinking and I would get a normal mum. But when she died the fantasy died with her.  I will never be able to help her to recovery. I feel useless because of it, like I failed. 

I feel guilty for being happier now, I feel guilty because I gave up on her. She was depressed and I turned my back on her and now I can't forgive myself. 

People just keep saying I hurt because I lost my mum, but I think it's because of much more selfish reasons that that. I just want to feel like I did my best, but I don't know how.",7

One time i crawled out of a window and then kinda came to and went back in (i was sleeping naked so im really really glad noone saw me) i thought it was a dream buy my partner woke up when i came back in and confirmed later it was not. Has THAT ever happened to you before? Both of these things are pretty freaky thinking back and i cant find much online so just curios. Thanks.,1

His doctor said he had encephalopathy, now that I've done more reading I see there are different kinds. He never said what kind, how can I know?

I'm also curious because I read that it's reversible, but the hospitalist told us it wouldn't be. He said that my dad's liver was failing and the only option was liver transplant and they refused to give him any more life sustaining medication. They said none of the medication they gave him was working because of his liver. But the Ativan worked. Later at Hospice, the morphine and the Oxy worked... why didn't any of the life sustaining medications work but these medications did?

I just feel like they didn't do all they could have. It's hard to know because when he was in the hospital we couldn't see him until they decided they to stop giving him meds. They kept him sedated, even if he wasn't sedated he wouldn't have been able to call us because he was basically out of his mind.

I am in Recovery, but I need your input...","Hey Guys -- My roommate (32 M) and me (31M) (we've only been living together for 2 months, but were high school friends another lifetime ago) is your classic Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde alcoholic.... He isn't mean or abusive when he drinks, but he goes on sprees and he tries to hide most of it in secret in his room. He was noticeably intoxicated the last two nights and then yesterday morning, I heard him crack a can open and I asked him if he was planning on drinking again today and he said -- ""yes, a lot.""

I went upstairs to talk to him and said ""that's fine, but go home and do it and don't come back here until you are sober"" -- because he's had a history with rehab / aa, but it's never stuck for him (denial) -- and he started breaking down and crying and saying he didn't want his parents to know he was drunk... So, I told him, if he wanted to stay here, then he had to give me all his booze -- and he handed over a case of beer and a bottle of vodka -- doubt that was all of it, tbh. I ended up giving him back a few beers later in the evening in case he experienced any DT's or withdrawal effects.

When he initially moved in, even knowing his alcohol history, I am a big believer in people coming to their own realizations -- I told him, I don't care if you get drunk once in awhile -- like big occasions -- wedding-type functions... I said other than that, keep it under control or you are out. He happily agreed and nothing really happen until I started noticing him locking himself in his room more and more and when he'd come down for food. So, he's definitely hiding alcohol in his room -- and I think he is a pretty high-functioning alcohlic so the fact that he couldn't hide his drunkenness the last few days probably shows he is really spiraling to his bottom.

Today he woke up and hasn't left his room. If he drinks again, I'm going to leave and call his mom and tell him he is done here. I can't deal with him when he is drunk a) because he could potentially get violent and b) he'll try to argue and the fact of the matter is there is no argument because he violated our agreement and is disrespecting my recovery. Plus, arguing with him doesn't ever go anywhere, because he is just drunk and he doesn't actually internalize any of it. I also know this because I am a freaking alcoholic in recovery and it was once impossible to negotiate with me when I was drunk!!! I really just want to kick him out or tell him to go home for a week. I don't need this in my life. I don't need him as a roommate -- I just asked him because I was lonely peek COVID-19 because I had broken up with my girlfriend who lived here. I can pay the bills by myself, but he was at least fun to talk to until I started picking up on his drinking. If anyone can offer any feedback on the situation, I'd really appreciate it. I don't know if I'm being to aggressive, but I think as a proud member of AA, I don't need to tolerate somebody that is actively abusing and I know its not my position to make him join AA -- he should want to do it for himself.",2

I‚Äôm trying to straighten up, but it‚Äôs just harder than I ever imagined. Never tried to quit before.
It‚Äôs almost different now than just being sober for an extended period of time...

My uncle has been suffering from alcoholism and there is no family support because of cultural values. My aunt works over 40 hours a week night shift supporting herself, my uncle, and her son (who pitches in for the rent).

Is there anyway in new York state, specifically Monroe County (Rochester,NY) to forcefully get him into rehab?

A bit of background: My partner (38 year old male) drinks 0,7-1,2 litres of 37,5% vodka a day and has been for 11 months. we have tried a  drink diary and lowering the intake that way, but it isn't working. He is that worried about the withdrawal symptoms that he's afraid to lower his drinking at all so I am just wondering what kind of help (medical/rehab etc) might be available and what are the pros and cons of them? Or if anyone has any advice in general, wether about medication or tricks to lower the amount of units.

His drinking really has negatively impacted our relationship, we are at a breaking point at the moment. I love him so much and I just want him to be healthy and I worry about him all day long. It affects his physical health, mental health and emotional wellbeing. He suffers with depression to begin with but these last 11 months he has been more depressed than I've seen him during our nearly 8 years together and it kills me. One thing that really has made the depression worse is the fact that he's put a bit of weight on since he started drinking and his confidence is gone completely and nothing I say helps. 
We also argue all the time because his fuse is so much shorter due to the drink and he can get violent when he gets too drunk. 

I just don't know what to do anymore.

We didn't speak for a period in our 20s where I learned he got engaged and developed a bad drug/ alcohol habit.  When we reconnected I helped him find his apartment and his parents helped him start his own personal business.  He would drink heavily on a consistent basis - but I never intervened because I respected how he managed to find a life that was self reliant.  

He quickly seemed to develop problems - he would have anxiety attacks, feeling like he couldn't leave his home and he stopped being able to run his business by himself.  Personal problems started to quickly mount, and eventually he pushed everyone close to him away.

I ran into him a couple of years ago - he seemed to be doing better - but I later found out that it was just to impress his ex girlfriend - which he eventually hooked up with.  This whole chapter emotionally destroyed him.  He wanted to go to AA.  I was taking him to meetings - drunk.  He found a sponsor that he pushed away.  And he focused more on his loneliness than recovery.

Fast forward to the present - where he's been calling me up intermittently for the last few months - and his whole world's on fire.  His dad's dying from prostrate cancer, his friend cheated him out of money and his girlfriend has broken up with him.

Talking to him makes me feel like I'm running in circles.  I'm griefed to the max when I see the pale shadow that he's become and I really feel like I don't have the words or know what to do for him.    Being around him is incredibly draining.  He gets into circular discussions, always asking questions  but not really listening to answers.  It takes a quick toll on me, I quickly find that I'm incapable of being there for him.  I don't trust him -  he lies and acts deceptively but yet I still want to try and help this guy.  


Yesterday he mentioned he is feeling like he is on a suicide run.  He's been to a psych ward, and he's prematurely left a detox centre 3 times in the past couple of months.  Talking to him isn't easy.  He explained that he was leaving detox early because they wouldn't give him the medication he thinks needs (vallium and attivan).  Apparently he had a seizure last time he tried to stop drinking.

I honestly don't know what to do.  He seems intent on burning down everything around him.  He picks fights with strangers, he has blown all of his personal resources and feel like he is intent on giving up. I want him to get better but I don't know what that looks like.  Everytime I see him he has gotten a lot worse and I don't know how to reach the guy.  Please help.",2

I must confess that I was skeptical at first, but it's actually very powerful to talk to a complete stranger who actually cares about what you've got to say.

If you're willing, you can also volunteer as an active listener and provide support to people who are struggling with a variety of issues, from general mental health to breakups and school stress.  You can pick to only talk to people who are currently in a path to sobriety. Honestly, it can be very cathartic to talk to others going through the same thing (but be warned that it can also be triggering - know your limits!). 

The whole website is completely anonymous, free and chat-based. It offers many different trainings and self-help guides, depending on whether you're a member or a volunteer!

Just had a heart to heart with my SO and I'm just tired of the lies, sneaking around, waking up feeling like shit.  I'm looking into a 90 day program.  I've already done 30 days twice (rehab) and I think I need more than a 30 day solution.

Anyway, I'm going to die if I don't stop, and even if I do stop without help, I might die anyway.  Perhaps I took AC/DC too seriously, I don't know, but I'm kind of freaking out right now.  I'm going to buy all my favorite beers tomorrow, and hopefully assume I'll never have another drink.  But I have so many psychological problems that booze covers up that I can't imagine living without it.  I have PTSD and depression, and anxiety, and beer kind of masks the negative effects of all that shit. But it also creates other problems, evidenced by my court date and my family struggling to deal with me.  I'm lucky they haven't bailed on me entirely.

I know that stuff like AA is based around not giving advice but I need some fucking advice right now.  I don't want to keep drinking and I don't want to quit.  And I'm going to have to deal with the law on Wednesday.  I'm not asking for legal advice, but I'm asking for someone to share their experience and hope.  I could really use it.

If you can recommend a good 90 program or just give me some good advice I'd appreciate it.  Again, I know the ethos of programs like AA is not giving advice, just sharing experience, and I'd appreciate your shared experience, but I sure could use a few words of wisdom right now.

I'm fucking hammered so I don't even know if this is the right sub.  Fuck me running.",2

Just some background info, I was a full blown alcoholic at 18 and finally gave it up years later. Prior to that, I started drinking heavily at 14. I was first
Hospitalized for alcohol at 15. Furthermore, I was arrest 3 times because of alcohol (and my stupidity). I decided to give up alcohol because it was destroying me, my relationships, and my liver. Yes, my liver was extremely damaged even at 21. Doctors told me my liver was like a ‚Äú90 year olds‚Äù. After remaining sober, my liver returned back to normal. Alcohol does not discriminate against age. It can happen to anyone.
If you have any questions or want any tips, feel free to comment. Sending positive vibes your way. It can be done, and you will get through this hellish nightmare just as I did.


Edit: Remember, the hardest part of quitting is remaining sober. I had to accept the fact that just ‚Äú1 beer‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt work. Don‚Äôt fall into this trap, if your like me, you will relapse WITHOUT a doubt. Remember the pain, commonly spoken about in AA, withdrawing should be a time of reflection. Sometimes, pain is a good thing. Remember the pain and struggle and ask yourself if you want to go through that again. 
Finally, absence is the hardest part. I will forever ‚Äúwant‚Äù a beer, but I have to accept that I can‚Äôt. Just remember, the longer you remain sober the easier it gets.",27

My close friends chatted trying to get a hold of me to no avail. I look at our discord server, they were frantically trying to figure out how to get a hold of my dad so he could check up on me.

I message them individually to let them know I'm ok. My closest friend tells me he's glad I'm fine, but that he's also not happy with how i behaved and that we'll talk tomorrow.

Sorry if this gets too long.
So I am a 27y old guy from Brazil, live with my parents, and am an alcoholic. I started drinking at 17, in high school, have always loved parties and going out. I am constantly told I am very handsome, never had problems hooking up with girls when I could still manage to go to parties.
When I was 18, I got into the best uni in latin america, got a great internship at GE, and had a crazy beautiful and smart girlfriend. Pretty good life right? Wrong, for the simple fact that I couldn't have done 1% of that without drinking (except for the uni part, of course). But I wouldn't have friends, wouldn't ever have any kind of relationship besides hookups, and wouldn't have gotten the internship (I used to drink before all interviews). I drank before presentations, before dates, and generally any situation that I would get anxious. 

At abou 20yo, my mom found a bottle of vodka in my bag on 2 occasions, and I decided to lay it all out. Started treatment with psychiatrist and therapist, taking meds, which helped a little with GAD. However that's when I really started drinking heavily. I would get absolutely wasted at every party, drink and black out every chance I got when alone at home. Discovered benzos and started abusing those too, research chemicals, kratom, tried coke, speed, mdma, lsd,, opiate meds, all while hiding the abuse as much as I could from family/friends/girlfriend. 

Las year was hell for me, my girlfriend who was absolutely the love of my life broke up with because of my addiction and 1,5yrs later I still love her deeply. I started having seizures, got fired from great jobs one after another.

Last august was the breaking point when I got wasted and passes out in the bathroom of the gym I went to (I was taking disulfiram - for those who don't know it makes you really really sick if you drink). Had a an intervention with parents, therapist and doctor saying that next slip I'd be going to rehab.

Got my stuff straight for the next whole year, thanks to the disulfiram tbh, however I was not happy, barely left the house, still missed ex. The medicine went out of production for some reason, and this week I went out for the first time in a year without having taken disulfiram, went on a date on a girl from tinder. As soon as I left the house the seed was planted, and I just knew I was going to be drinking that day, no matter what. Stopped at the market and picked up vodka, drank about 300ml before the date, which went fine. The girl headed home and I booked an airbnb for myself.
To spare any further details, I ended up leaving the place on wednesday, having drunk 4l of vodka in total, not giving a shit about work, family, my health and feeling like shit.

I got home and tried to deny it, but my mom can detect alcohol from a mile away. Now I really don't see how I will be able to support all this without alcohol or benzos. The only barrier I really had was the disulfiram, I am too anxious to have a normal conversation sober, to go out, to meet new people or participate in work meetings. My anxiety meds don't help with punctual high anxiety situations and benzos are out of the question because of my convulsions and mainly because I would surely abuse them, and I take regular urine tests.

I am 27 and have absolutely no independence, am not allowed to drive, am an extreme burden to my family (my dad works in the USA and my brother is a doctor there, my mom only stays in Brazil to watch over me). Going to live in the US is not an option for me either, because whatever anxiety and insecurities I have is multiplied by ten when in a foreign language. 

I do not know what expects me in the future but just cannot see any happy way out. I do not even consider killing myself but don't see any way to have joy in life anymore. Just for the record I have excellent professional support, I have one of the best chemical depency doctors in the country and my therapist is a rockstar and I love her, but nothing is enough.

I am sorry for the very long post and thank you for reading even just a part of it.",4

I‚Äôm scared of all the money I‚Äôm wasting what if I can‚Äôt pay my bills next month?
I hate my body. The only time I seem to be in a good mood is really early in the morning, drinking coffee. I hate my job too.

It‚Äôs not the job it‚Äôs being around people.
So I was listening to my favourite musician on a twitch stream this morning, tried to write some progressions and melodies of my own. Now after I ate a bunch of food to try get rid of the hangover it‚Äôs not even 1pm and I want to start drinking just because I keep getting this sinking feeling.

I keep feeling like every day is a waste of time, waiting for payments, waiting for bills, waiting for my diet to pay off, waiting for my doctors appointments, just waiting.
I took a break from trying to write music for only a few minutes and now I think I should drink. Just to get rid of the weird sinking feeling. The logical response would be to not drink so that I don‚Äôt have to feel like this tomorrow.

Before last weekend I was 3 weeks sober, then I drank for two days. Then I got another bottle maybe days later. Logical response would be to just ignore it but it just keeps getting more difficult by the hour. 
I don‚Äôt want to get wasted I just want to stop feeling so depressed and anxious but I always end up getting wasted. I don‚Äôt want to become an alcoholic, no one seems to be concerned about the amount I drink but I also am 23F and live alone.
I felt ok this morning, but by noon I feel like crap, usually every day is like this. I want to write more music with the computer, but I want to drink a bit first so I don‚Äôt feel depressed and I can go back to feeling at least ok.

My life has always been like this.. I haven‚Äôt been able to consistently attend school because of anxiety and depression, now as an adult I can‚Äôt consistently attend work for the same reason. Now there‚Äôs alcohol added into the mix... I‚Äôm eventually going to be deemed disabled and have what little freedom I have as an adult taken away from me.

I quit daily drinking a year back and then felt strong enough to try controlled social drinking like I used to in school, which I failed at. First few months I would drink on the weekend and my throat would get worse. Then after being sober during the week it would get better. Once lockdown started and days started merging this went out the window and I started drinking daily again.

It has now been 2 weeks since I realised I was out of control and decided to quit altogether again, however my throat has only shown minor improvement. Anyone else have experience with this?

We have desperately tried to get him set up with a temporary state ID here in TN for medicaid but things have been difficult. He failed his eye test fo me a drivers license. So we resulted to a temporary ID which he needs the original copy of his SS card. Which is back in storage in Denver. So we are currently seeking a replacement card through the SS website. 

He doesn't want to get anything done. There are days he wants to help himself, but others where it's just beating around the bush of bullshit. It's taken a toll on both parents and myself. Both parents are on social security and barley receive enough to get by on their own, now they have a 26 year old son living with them. Dad has Alzheimer's so thats enough stress as is.

I (42f) have been dating a guy (40m) for a year and a half.  He has serious mental health issues, as do I (we met in group therapy, lol). His issues are much more severe, however, and have kept him from having much human interaction and leaving the house for things other than doctor's appointments for 20 years.  When we got together, I knew he had the mental issues he has, but what I didn't realize was how much he was using alcohol to cope.  I was under the impression that for the first couple of months we were seeing each other he didn't drink, he corrected me on this this weekend and said he did the whole time.  He wouldn't have been able to interact with me otherwise.  When I did start to see how much he drank, I wasn't overly concerned because he is never mean, or abusive when he drinks.  He is usually just relaxed and pretty ""normal"".  He has blood tests he has to take every few months because of a medical issue and the results came back that his kidney function is off and he has low potassium.   He believes the drinking is the culprit and is trying to cut down.  I am 100% behind him and will do whatever he needs me to do to help.  Here is the problem...my bf's mental health is so bad that none of the pills he has ever been prescribed work.  The only thing he has ever used that helped him is alcohol, which he never touched until he was 38 (2 years ago). Since beginning to drink, he has done so many things he has never done before like dating me, going to the movies, going hiking, staying away from home for extended periods of time, going in stores etc. He told me this weekend he can't do any of those things without alcohol.  He is extremely depressed without it and in a constant state of panic.  He said he can't interact with me sober (which I don't believe to be true,  but it is what he thinks ) and he doesn't know how that will effect our relationship.  I am left here reeling from the news.  I feel like he is saying that we need to go to a fwb situation, and I can't do that.  I don't want him to hurt his body further by drinking, but it helps his mind so much.   I feel selfish wanting him to continue drinking, but I am scared to death I am going to lose him without it.  Overall, I care enough about him to support him if he decides to cut back significantly or to quit, regardless of the outcome for me.  But, I am confused and scared at the moment.  I am wondering if anyone has known someone like my boyfriend?  If anyone has been in a similar situation?  Or if anyone with experience with alcoholism and mental health has any opinions.  I welcome any and all feedback (except nasty comments). For the record, we do drink together on the weekends quite often, but I only drink with him and don't have a problem going without it.  It is more social for me than anything.

Right?

It‚Äôs so refreshing and the light buzz brings you into a euphoric high when the endorphins in your system collide with the alcohol. Too often this makes us want more, until we find ourselves hammered on another Saturday night, only to wake up the next morning wishing we had tapped the breaks a bit last night.

For many of us, when we get honest with ourselves, it is not the celebratory drink that is a problem in our lives, it is the drink that took a drink, then the drink that took a piece of our lives.

What do I mean here?

I‚Äôve been through the cycle that you may be experiencing now. It is impossible to have ‚Äújust one‚Äù, because ‚Äújust one‚Äù more often than not, leads to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have one more‚Äù and then, before you know it, it‚Äôs the next day and once again, you wish you did not have one too many last night. This same pattern may go on for years.

You go through constant cycles of swearing alcohol off completely, taking long breaks, feeling better, but inevitably, the day comes where you are back on the slosh wagon, waking up with a pounding headache from a glass too many last night, wishing that you kept the plug in the jug, and likely regretting what you did.

I know this internal battle intimately.

Years ago I was high functioning adventurous professional with a full time career I had a drinking problem that helped cover up how I felt about things going on in life at the time. And, when I talk about high functioning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I had an external life that was perceptually perfect‚Ä¶ some of my greatest accomplishments were sprinkled in throughout my drinking; marathons, mountain climbs, and even a college degree‚Ä¶ my career was thriving and stable‚Ä¶ my economic life was not in total ruins‚Ä¶ I enjoyed skiing (when I was not hungover)‚Ä¶ I managed to never grow a giant booze belly

I was not your stereotypical under the bridge alcoholic.

But, under this external image of perfection there was an insecure, imperfect, hurting little boy, who really wanted to have a different life, free from the grips of alcohol.

But I was afraid‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ what would my friends think?‚Ä¶ am I an alcoholic?‚Ä¶ I am not an alcoholic, there is no way I am going to take on this label, no fucking way.‚Ä¶ how will I have any fun ever without alcohol? I don‚Äôt want to become jaded and straight edged.‚Ä¶ who will I be without alcohol?

With time, simple answers came to all these fear based questions that I had. And, today, I live an alcohol free life that is beyond dreamy.

Gratefully, I‚Äôve found that there is a solution to this madness of being a weekly drunkard, that myself and millions of others have discovered. Actually, not drinking for me, has become pretty freaking awesome‚Ä¶ but I resisted that this was even possible for years.

It starts with acknowledging that it is not your fault. Alcohol is addictive as hell and media programs our subconscious mind to believe that it will help bring us everything we dream of when in reality it brings us the opposite effects.

Reprogramming of our beliefs around alcohol must happen at the subconscious level and this requires acknowledging the fact that what we believe to be true in thought may not match our years of false programming around alcohol.

Because for many of us, we have never really experienced life without alcohol it is hard to imagine what life could be without it. Exploring this new world alone can be scary, paralyzing in fact, but it is well worth the adventure.

I‚Äôve been free from the magical and destructive potion of alcohol for over 3 years and I‚Äôd love for you to get to experience the richness of life and relationships without booze.

If you‚Äôre ready to break free, hit me up. Shoot me a short message and let‚Äôs have an open honest chat.",3

 30(M) here...been dealing with my alcoholic father 67(M) for my entire life. He‚Äôs been in and out of rehab outpatient/inpatient you name it dozens of times. Never abusive just the type who changes personalities when they drink and aren‚Äôt the person you know. Holds down jobs for a little till the drink really takes him off then gets let go hits a somewhat rock bottom then goes to rehab. Been going on forever yet his last couple he‚Äôs said he can‚Äôt go through that detox again. First memories I have are of him fighting verbally with my mother over drinking. Divorced obviously at a young age. Siblings all went to therapy and we all have our own mental issues as adults now. He Always stuck to beer once he starts but then can‚Äôt stop. His worst was putting down a case (30 beers) a day for a few months straight. Pancreatitis surgery, all that jazz, guy got out the hospital went back on the booze that was 13 some years ago. He is off and on his sobriety every few years. Longest stint was 5 maybe 6 years sober. 

I believe my father‚Äôs pattern is unbreakable and he‚Äôs destined to continue until the one day comes where it kills him. Been feeling this way about him since I was 11...he‚Äôs clearly depressed, has anxiety, mental issues as a child, and his grandparents were alcoholics, believe he had a rough upbringing with his siblings with some mental trauma but my grandparents (his parents) were great to us. Medically he says he can‚Äôt handle any medication anti depressants, anti anxiety etc for they make him feel completely off. 

It breaks my heart that he was able to get through my wedding (sober) a year ago and my wife and I are doing a short week at his place currently to see him and spend some time for he lives alone and far away,  ( also for traveling for my wife‚Äôs medical appointments) to find that he‚Äôs relapsed again...I knew the minute I saw him in the afternoon. I know where this goes gets worse loses his job hits rock bottom back to rehab. It just sucks cause with his older age I‚Äôd figured he‚Äôd finally get a grip and mean it this time but I assumed wrong again. Is it worth even trying to talk to my father anymore? 

I‚Äôve had this conversation with him at age 11, 13, 15, 18, 24....and those are the only ones I can remember. I just don‚Äôt see what a difference this makes anymore.

I've been on this sub for a while now but never really contributing, now here I am. 

I'm 13M and I have the problem that my parents drink a lot of alcohol. Mostly things like rum or vodka. I am really worried because of this and it does affect the relationship between me and my parents. They drink from 2 to 4-5 times a week, there's hasn't been a week where they didn't drink at all for a long time. They usually buy two bottles of some high-percentage alcohol and drink it on one evening; they both drink equally as much usually but sometimes my dad (stepdad) drinks more. At this moment I'm on vacation with my little brother at my Granny's for a month. I've been here for a week and everytime I called them, I think it was four times, I could tell they were drunk again. It's really bad. They often lay down in their bedroom, watch a show on their laptop and drink themselves to sleep, although I have a little sister (3 years old) and I sometimes have to take care of her with my brother. When I talk to them about it, they say that it's none of my business what they do, and that they only drink because we (me and my two brothers) are causing them so much stress and they need it to stress themselves out. My mom has been having depression for a long time in the past and when I asked her not to drink too much back then, she told me that she wouldn't be here if not the alcohol. Luckily, she doesn't say that anymore but doesn't drink less.

Maybe you can give me some advice. I'd really be happy about anything. Maybe I have to add that my mother is suffering from Graves' disease. Also we are living in Germany, although originally we're from Poland, and so my parents don't speak German well (I do, though), if that's important.

Thanks.",10

I‚Äôm a 21yo and my little brother of 18yo has had some drinking problems lately. He‚Äôs a very introverted guy and has few friends. He quit school at 17 even though he‚Äôs very smart, because he‚Äôs bad at working for something he‚Äôs not interested in. Which is why he‚Äôs now home every day and changed his whole sleeping schedule only dedicated to playing chess online. He‚Äôs never outside the house, only to play chess at a local company every tuesday night. He has a few mates there but they usually drink aswell so idk if its a good influence either.
He hates to be outside and has social anxiety. He has been tested for autism ADHD & stuff but he doens‚Äôt seem to have any, which makes all of this even more confusing for me to understand.

He started stealing my dad‚Äôs beer when he was about 16. It started pretty innocent and he‚Äôd do it once a month. My mom did tell him to stop but he continued and since my parents are divorced and my dad himself drinks beer 3 times a week aswell, my brother can do what he wants.

It‚Äôs been getting worse, stealing wine that I bought and was supposed to be for me and my girlfriends, stealing more beer and beer and seeing him very drunk at night, sometimes puking.

I wrote him a letter in which I explained my worries. He cried and told me he wants to stop it. I really hoped it would work, but it didnt. My mom has also had so many convos with him about it, but he doesnt stop.

Just today, when I thought it was kinda going better, I found a box in his room, with 8!!!! bottles of strong alcohol. Vodka, whiskey and even jagermeister. 4 empy 4 full. He ordered them himself, which must have been like 70 euros, though he hasn‚Äôt ever had a job in his life and is just spending my dad‚Äôs saved up money for his education.
So i confronted him and he ignored me and told me Im dramatic. I full on exploded and yelled how sad I am, it was an emotional words vomit and since then i‚Äôve been crying for hours. My dad knew about it, which makes it so much more painful as i‚Äôm also dissapointed in him... 

It breaks my heart to see him like that.. its very hard on me. I work in a psychiatric hospital so I know how things can escalate. Addiction runs in the family and to see my little brother like this hurts like hell. I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs an alcoholic and will turn out miserable and homeless... I know this might not help and i dont exactly know what I want out of this post but I guess some friendly words or same experiences or advice would help, also to not feel so damn lonely and sad.",2
2020-08-03 00:39:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i2qrhi/am_i_going_to_be_an_alcoholic_like_my_father/,Am I going to be an alcoholic like my father?,"I‚Äôm currently in an outpatient program because during quarantine I had realized me smoking weed for the last two years had gotten really out of hand. My mom has warned me all of my life that my dad was an addict. He was addicted to alcohol and cocaine. I only saw him ever other weekend, and because my mom was so against it and I didn‚Äôt see my dad all that often, I was obsessed with the thought of it because it seemed ‚Äúmature.‚Äù At the beach, beginning at 13 my dad and stepmom would have me have a glass of wine or drink with them. Telling me it was because I was so mature. I felt so ‚Äúcool‚Äù at the time. I was straight edge and a mover and shaker overachieving kid. And thought it was cool when they would ask me to have a drink. I only ever had one. Never getting tipsy but I remember wanting to know what it felt like. Even as a kid, after watching my dad drink when he had custody I would ask my mom if the waitress at Olive Garden could put apple juice in a wine glass for me. To be ‚Äúlady like.‚Äù Well, eventually my dads drinking started disgusting me. In late high school I thought it was cool and edgy and a way for me to finally let my hair down by drinking some. I never got drunk. My friends and I maybe 3 times got a little bit of liquor from our parents cabinet and mixed it with coke, never getting even tipsy. I wasn‚Äôt infatuated with it, but I did like the idea of not always following the rules and being the overachiever I felt I needed to be all the time. The first time I really remembered getting drunk was at my high school graduation party with friends. I HATED the way I felt the next morning. I was so embarrassed. Over my senior year I had smoked maybe 3 times. Again, didn‚Äôt really like being out of my mind and body but liked that it made me ‚Äúcool‚Äù even though only my ‚Äúcool friends‚Äù could know. I never wanted my mom to know anything, even though I barely did anything, because I knew she‚Äôd just warn me about my dad. My senior year summer I went to hangout festival and drank but always was never more than tipsy and could always drive us back whereas my friends would get wasted. 

In college I went out a few times and drank, got drunk some of those times but not consistently. Just enough at the beginning to have a fun time. But I always kept tabs on everyone and would help them out, I wouldn‚Äôt be sober doing it, but I never let myself get too drunk or sloppy. Again, this was only maybe once every two weeks in my first semester of college. I loved the social part of it. Wine nights, etc. but I had the car and always would never get drunk so I could drive us back to the dorms. That same semester, though I had only smoked a handful of times, I began smoking with people I deemed ‚Äúcool.‚Äù During that time I found that weed helped me sleep significantly. Something I had always had anxiety about (especially at my dads) as a kid. I started off just socially. Eventually when the ‚Äúcool‚Äù people said we had to start buying it on our own we did. We wanted to pitch in. In 6-8 months my friend group and I went from splitting 1/8 all together, to then my friend saying we all had to start buying our own because she wanted to smoke more. This friend group would always say they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt sleep without it‚Äù and that made me so nervous. Once I started smoking I lost any interest I had in drinking. Smoking was the cool thing, I didn‚Äôt like the upbeat lifestyle of drinking and partying. I may have had a glass of wine while smoking with friends. But I never drank alone or bought it. My freshman year of college I began smoking a lot more. By sophomore year, I believed what my friends had said about NEEDING weed for sleep. I just accepted that as my truth too. 

Summer after sophomore year I got a job touring for a summer where we couldn‚Äôt smoke (we didn‚Äôt get drug tested, but I deemed it orogesssional and said I didn‚Äôt want to) I LOVED the way I felt. I loved not needing weed to sleep. However, the girl I met who is now my girlfriend was 22 and liked to drink. I told her about my dad, how I like drinking but don‚Äôt have a taste for it and I don‚Äôt drink when I‚Äôm sad or alone because my mother had knocked the fear into me about my dad.

That first summer without weed my girlfriend introduced me to drinking sometimes, but again, I was 20 and I enjoyed it and we got tipsy/drink occasionally but not much. She was a pretty heavy drinker and I ended up driving for her. I didn‚Äôt like it when she was drunk, but I didn‚Äôt mind it if we were both tipsy.

Then, back to my junior year I started back smoking (this time not fun like it used to be, but instead to numb from some toxic shit I wanted to escape). Everyone in my friend group did, and though I wanted to stop I just said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point? I miss my gf and this year has been so hard.‚Äù 

Then, summer of my junior year I went back touring with my girlfriend. Again, no weed. I was 21. We drank a lot. More than I would have liked to admit. We drank almost every night and I felt at that point in my life (where I hadn‚Äôt the first tour) like I needed either booze or trazodone to sleep. I‚Äôd drink like 1-5 drinks a day. All in good fun, we thought we were just young and saw nothing wrong with it.

Well, now in this last year we have been living together in Chicago and smoke daily. We rarely drink unless we go out, and even then it‚Äôs a drink or two at dinner or a brunch. But smoking for me got really bad. Escape. I recently started Marijuana anonymous because the smoking with quarantine got out of hand for me. 

But with stopping smoking, I haven‚Äôt drank. I am doing so purposely because I don‚Äôt want to replace the habit. I have done a shit ton of therapy and found that my root for escape from weed came from a lot of trauma I blocked out and did not healthily work through. My dad, is 53 and in end stage alcoholism. I am now trying to get him in rehab to save him. While I believe weed to be a thing over me that has me powerless, I have not felt that way about alcohol. With the exception of that summer I drank too much. Now that I have identified the root of my need to escape, is it bad if I have drink? I feel like my mom and everyone is in my ear since I have chosen to be honest about weed. And I already am paranoid to ever drink. But at such a young age I don‚Äôt feel like I should be freaking out or have to prove If I have a beer or two or a glass of wine at a social event. I also don‚Äôt want to become my dad. I just DONT see that happening but I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt see this happening to him either. Any advice based on him and my experiences growing up?",3

&#x200B;

My mom has been dealing with alcoholism for multiple decades. She drinks heavily everyday, and my sister and I have decided that we need to have an intervention now that she is leaving for college and my mom would be living alone. My dad lives on his own now, but said he would be present for the intervention/check-in to a facility.

My dad has tried to talk to my mom about her alcoholism in the past, but has had no success. She denies hiding wine glasses/bottles from everybody, drinking in the morning, etc.

We're getting her two to three closest friends involved in the intervention and plan on bringing proof (when my dad lived at home, he would take pictures of the levels of the wine bottles when he left for work in the early morning and came back around noon). We want her to check into a 90-day inpatient facility.

I expect it to be an absolute shit show, and I was hoping anybody who's had to do this in the past could give me tips about what they did that was effective, and what they wish they did differently.

&#x200B;

Thank you Reddit, your support means a lot.

**TL;DR:** planning to have an intervention with a family member, what should I do/not do?

Edit: Not trying to prove anybody wrong. The reason I made a post in the first place was because I want to do this in the best way possible and genuinely wanted to know what's worked for others in the past. From what I've learned by talking to mental health experts, the best course of action is going to be hiring a specialist, which is what we're going to do.

I saw rule 2 and wasn't sure if this would apply or not sorry if it does.

What title says, basically, I'm not sure if hallucinating is the right word for it. They called upset, claiming that certain people they know had driven to their house and stood outside the door loudly talking, they were sure it was them. Opened the door and they weren't there, so figures they must have driven off before they could open the door. There's a 0% chance those people were ever there. Something similar happened years ago, where they thought people they knew were screaming and trying to break into their house, but those people were in a different state at the time...

Anyways. I'm sure there's a variety of medical issues that could explain behavior like this -- I'm not asking for any of those or what you think they might have. I'm just wondering if this is something that can be caused by chronic alcoholism specifically. They have been an alcoholic for years, recently tried getting sober for the first time, but I don't think it's going too well, so idk if that factors into it. I couldn't tell if they were drunk on the phone or not.",1

My dad used to tell people I saved his life. But I‚Äôm not the hero of this story. 


My parents has been separated when my mom found out she was pregnant with me. They had fought about his drinking. When she told my dad she was pregnant, she told him that if he ever wanted to be a part of my life he would have to stop drinking and start going to meetings. 


And my Dad did, he stopped drinking, he started to go to meetings. Every year about 8 months before my birthday he celebrated another year sober. In his more contemplative times he would tell me that he was sure he was on the path to an early death if he hadn‚Äôt stopped. He would say that none of the reasons to drink were important than his reasons not to drink. 


I know it wasn‚Äôt easy. I know he struggled. I know that he had dark days. And I know that he still went to meetings often. But because he was so brave and committed I got to have 34 great years with my Dad. 


My dad was an alcoholic my entire life, but I never saw him drunk. That is how I saved his life. 


But he saved my life. Everyday. Sometimes literally (like when a curious 3-year old decided to chase a butterfly off a cliff and was only stopped by her father‚Äôs quick reflexes) but mostly figuratively, being support and guidance for me as I navigated life. 


I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going through and I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to face your struggles. But I hope you find the things that are more important than alcohol to you and you hold on to them so that 35 years later someone can tell the story of how you saved their life.",40

I wasn‚Äôt Ms. Crabby Pants all the time, but I was aware it was happening way too much, and looking back at my reactions, just plain unnecessary.  I owe my hubby a huge apology.  Been married 33 years. 

My anger got worse over the last decade+ with the increased drinking. Luckily we do have a lot of fun together, and both have a great sense of humor, along with wonderful, funny families. He is quite the opposite mood-wise. Peeps would joke I was a saint to put up with HIM because he is very social and the life of the party. I would half-heartedly chuckle at their observation, and my inner voice would scream: if they only knew that awful part of me.

after living with them for two weeks it became obvious  to me that the father has a drinking problem. (i cannot believe i didn‚Äôt notice before) he has been drunk every day and on two or three occasions i have drank and smoked weed with him. the mother doesn‚Äôt care but has expressed that she is jealous that she can‚Äôt participate since she is pregnant. one night it all came to blows i came home after spending time with my family and he was drunk and slamming doors and yelling at the mother calling her controlling in front of their young daughter. he is genuinely the nicest guy ever and one of the best people i know with a huge heart. it was very scary to see the person alcohol can turn him into. over the following days the situation slowly escalated and i got sucked into a weird couple and family dynamic i was not prepared for. he has since expressed his embarrassment for his behavior but now they have both opened up to me their relationship and personal problems (he likes to use this to excuse his drinking) 
i feel a bit trapped. 
the situation has died down for now and he says he is not drinking (but he might still be) she says that she is not going to be the one to make him stop drinking that‚Äôs up to him but that she might have to leave him if things get bad again and he continues to choose alcohol over his family 
i feel it is only a matter of time before things escalate again, especially since the mother is going to have the baby soon and openly talks about how she is going to drink and smoke as soon as she is done breastfeeding. 
i do not know where my place is as their friend/employee/roommate/occasional relationship mediator. 
if it were my family i know how i would handle the situation. i would ban all alcohol and drugs and do everything in my power to be the glue that holds the family together, however as their employee i do not want to overstep my place, but i feel that somehow the responsibility lies on me to keep the peace in the house (especially for the child) and a big part of that is to keep alcohol out of the house.

He hasn't gone without alcohol for more than 2 days in the past 2.5 years of marriage. Even when we were dating he always had a glass in his hand.
For a long time it felt fine, coz I had a drink or two with him as well.

But looking at the past 2.5 years he's never without a drink in the evenings.
When I bring it up it, at first it started with yes yes I'm gonna stop n do exercise n get fit n all.
These days if I bring it up it usually becomes a rant then a fight with him telling how I'm not perfect myself so why do I expect others to be perfect (I'm not expecting that I just want him to control his drinking).

Today we had an argument about precaution on covid19, I'm paranoid about it, he's not.
It ended up in a fight and I just had it.
I went n opened the wine bottles and just threw it down the sink. 
He is more of a rum guy.
The wine was actually for me, for a Friday unwinding kinda drink, but it was used more by him whenever his rum is over. So I got fed up and threw it away. 
He saw. Yelled at the top of his voice so even the neighborhood heard.
I just kept quiet n zoomed\phased out of the moment ignoring him.

Maybe it's wrong what I did. But I'm done playing nice. I'm done begging him to seek therapy and what I can do to make his life better. I'm going through some problems of my own and after 2.5 years of focusing on him n his problems I need to focus on myself right now.

I needed to rant somewhere. Because I can't talk about this with anyone in family or friends, it's complicated, maybe for another post.

A few weeks ago he relapsed and called me an addict and a mooch. This really seemed like he was projecting his shit onto me (and in denial about his own problem) because I was providing him with food and an internet connection, and I have also given him a bed. We had an argument that was just crazy, I pointed out that he was an addict too (he had 2/3 of a 5th of rum that day) and he said, ""no, I'm an alcoholic"" (he calls him self a ""functioning alcoholic"" like Samuel L. Jackson). We broke up that day. and I paid him back for the money he spent on me the next day.

Do people with addiction problems project their stuff onto thers as a form of denial? It seems weird he would call me that when I was making an effort to quit and he didn't seem to, or be able to.

TLDR: I am trying to quit drinking by making sure I have no money to spend on alcohol. My alcoholic SO called me an addict and a mooch (while very drunk) even though I regularly provide food/wifi for him. I think he was projecting, is this common among addicts/alcoholics?",2
