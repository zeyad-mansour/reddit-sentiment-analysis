As we got older, I kind of began to distance myself from him, because my parents tended to coddle him and allow him to talk to me any old way.

Then around three years ago, he and I got in a fight. I ended up hitting him and spitting on him, and I regret it. Since then I've apologized many times, and he's accepted it, and I still regret it.

a HUGE reason why I began detaching from my brother, even before the fight we had, was because he would drink and his entire personality would change and he would talk to me in degrading ways. And one night I was just sick of it. After that I decided to just leave him alone, and while i was sorry, I was not going to allow someone to talk about me, my job, my dreams, my relationships....It's like he knew what I was most insecure about, and he'd throw it in my face when he drank.

I told my parents years ago that I thought my brother had issues around drinking, and they told me to be quiet, and that I was overreacting. My brother would always get super defensive whenever I brought it up. So I apologized to my brother, and just distanced myself.

Fast forward now, 2021, my brothers drinking has gotten worst apparently. my parents are finally beginning to take it seriously that my older brother may be struggling with alcoholism even though he tells everyone he's fine. Last month he went to hospital for the first time for alcohol poisoning, and tonight he called my parents cursing them out. After he was in the hospital last month, he'd been hiding that he was drinking. My mom still wants to coddle him, and thinks she's going to force a 31 year old into rehab. and my dad is blaming himself because he drinks beer once in a while.

I don't know how to feel about this. I think I'm going to reach out and call my brother tomorrow. he's always saying that i never call him (he never calls me. the one time he called me last month, he was drunk. he said he wasn't, but i knew he was. my mom ignores his drunk rants, but I can tell. I know how my brother sounds. That night he ended up starting a fight with my younger cousin), so I wanted to take the initiative and call him. i don't something to happen and feel like it's partially my fault because I didn't reach out to him...

Any tips on dealing with this? I don't know what to do. I honestly feel bad and stuck. I have no idea how to help him, or my parents....",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971066117286682}"

He minimises it, and even believes in his own lies and stories. He thinks the doctors told him that he should rest, get exercise and all will get well. We know the doctors told him to stop drinking several years ago.

***I am really sorry for the post being so late. Lets Start.***

***So I walked out and bought another 4 miniatures. I don't know why but I always started with miniatures. Maybe because they look small and harmless. Consoled my mind into thinking that you ain't drinking much.***

***When I bought the miniatures I never thought that I will start again. In my mind ""ONLY FOR TODAY'. I am a living example of a man who drank without a reason. I had no stresses. A happy loving family. A beautiful girlfriend. Good work & pocket full of cash. Still at that moment I went out and bought the alcohol.***

***I drove off & while driving I drank the first miniature. You all are gonna think it would have tasted delicious. But to me it tasted so fcking bad !!!!! It tasted like a rotten lemon. I realized something then. The taste has always been this bad. But with time your tongue gets used to it. So when I tasted it. I was like Wtf ! Its so bad how did I ever get addicted to it. Oh I will definitely not get addicted to this shit. Funny thing. When I was thinking all this, I had finished the other three as well. As I was drinking after a long time, those 4 miniatures got me high like I had drank half a litre. I smoked a couple of cigs & I dozed off in the car for an hour.***

***I went back home later and slept. Next morning I was very happy. I HAD NO PAIN. I was cured of pancreatitis. LOL how dumb I was. I knew there was no cure. The pancreas will heal itself but it will always remain sensitive to alcohol. I knew that. But still I was thinking I am all good now. So next thing I do when I leave the house is I buy another 4 miniatures. But this time I was smart. Let me tell you how.***

***I sat in my car and thought of why I ended up getting pancreatitis. Here are the reasons I thought of;***

1. ***I drank too much too fast.***
2. ***I drank neat. No water No Soda No Ice.***
3. ***I drank in mornings.***
4. ***I had only whisky. (considered a hard drink)***

***These were the reasons I could come up with. Funny right. So I thought of changing my drinking pattern. I will not drink during daytime. I will not exceed 250ml a day. I will always mix something in it. No more neat. So I started drinking. I followed my rules for sometime. I have no idea how things spiraled down so fast. Within 2 months I was an alcoholic again. I was drinking in day time. I was drinking around a bottle a day. Though I followed 1 rule not to drink neat. LOL. Around Sep 2017, I started experiencing a little pain in my abdomen. I got so so so so so scared. I was having having cold sweats when the pain started. I immediately flushed the remaining alcohol & started my homeopathy medicine again. Hoping the pain will subside soon. And within a week it did. I slept for 26 hours in total in that week. Because. I was an alcoholic again. Insomnia drove me nuts. My hands were constantly shaking. I felt like thousands and thousands of insects are roaming all over my body. I was addicted again.***

***When the pain stopped. I was back on track. But this time I thought I should stop with whisky. I should follow my rule 4 and shifted from whisky to wine. I thought maybe it was the alcohol concentration in whisky which caused the pain. Wine is diluted I will be fine. LOL dumb again.***

***When I started drinking wine. That was the time when my pancreas and pocket both suffered. Wine was expensive. Wine had low alcohol content. I had to drink more and more to become sane. By sane i mean, even a bottle of wine, a full big one was not even sufficient to get me to sleep. I was drinking 3 bottles of wine a day. I started fucking drinking in my own factory's office. I would bring the bottle in my office bag. During lunch. I would drink the wine straight from bottle very very very fast. I was scared someone might come. And then I would have lunch to get rid of the smell.***

***But when my pocket started suffering. I was back to whisky in no time. After spending a thousand dollars a month on wine I was done. But occasionally when my pockets were full I would drink wine. So I was back to whisky and a raging alcoholic. within no time. The pain started again. 24th November 2017. The pain started. My parents had gone out of town to my grandma's house. I was alone. I bought 3 halves of whisky. That's around a 1 litre. I started partying on 24th. I ate so much junk along with the whisky. NO LIMIT !!! I started experiencing a lot of pain on 25th. You know what I did. I drank even more. You might ask WHY? WHY DID I DRINK IN PAIN ? You know what my dumb idiot brain said to me. ""YOU ARE NOW IN PAIN. YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING. YOU STOP FROM TOMORROW NOW. DRINK TODAY. HARDCORE ALCOHOLIC THINKING. So I drank. I finished all the alcohol I bought. I drank in pain. First time the pain was so much that I could not get up from the bed to go piss. I pissed in a glass without leaving the bed. But my addiction level was so high. I drank and drank until I blacked out.***

***26th November 2017 morning 9:00am. My pain had crossed all bounds. I was laying in bed like a cocoon. Holding my abdomen with one hand and medicine in the other. I was again having an acute pancreatitis attack. The pain was excruciating. It felt like my pancreas would burst and i would die right now. I was covered in sweat in my cold room. My mind was numb. My eyes were red with tears. I was alone waiting for my parents to return. BUT THIS TIME SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT.***

The past 10 years or so I've been more or less an on/off fairly functioning alcoholic. It all started when i decided to stop using drugs. I basically traded drug dependence for alcohol dependence. As for which is worse, i can't really say. At least alcohol comes with less legal problems.

Anyway, my drinking escalated a lot after losing my girlfriend and job. And March 2021 i basically drank 750ml vodka daily, or more. One morning i decided to call my only living relative; ma granny. I felt fairly normal at the time but it quickly became apparent i was drunk as f\*ck, and my grandmother refused to speak with me and told me I'd have to sober up if i wanted to speak to her. So i thought ""very well, I'll quit drinking from now"". I went to the store and bought some food, albeit i had some issues paying for the stuff as my mind was kinda working in slow motion and i had difficulties answering the cashier. And when i was gonna pack my stuff in my backpack i froze, couldn't for the life of me understand how to open the bag. Took me a minute or two. Then on my way back to my apartment i walked with my mouth wide open without me noticing, some woman laughed hysterically at me when she saw me.

Back home, i started sweating. Imagine being in a sauna. My clothes got soaking wet very quickly. My heart started beating like a bongo drum at a rave party. Nausea prevented me from standing up. And i also got a headache out of this world. Quite literally the worst headache I've ever felt in my whole life. Dehydrated and hungry all i could do was lay in my bed. And I laid there for one day, not able to sleep.. and every minute felt like an hour. It was torture, slow never ending pain. I had to drink something, so i stood up and walked to my desk to grab a soda, oh boy that was some tough steps. And i accidently stepped on a sharp ceramic shard from a broken plate i broke during one of my drunken adventures a few nights before. It lodged deep in my big toe. Yey. Had to find a pair of pincers and dig it out. I shat my pants, had vertigo, lips, throat and mouth felt more dry than the sahara desert. Anyway, i had started to get auditory and minor visual hallucinations. Distorted sounds and waves/asymmetric lines in my perception. Sounds, no matter what intensity hurt my brain. And the light! It pierced my eyes with accompanying throbbing pain in my skull. My jaw muscles contracted so hard constantly like i was trying to be a contender of a bodybuilding contest like Mr.Olympia or Mr.Universe. At one point a tooth broke and i spat half of it out. ""What the actual fuck"" went through my head, what bad luck i had. Being in such a miserable state, and i also have to lose a tooth on top of it? I had tremors so bad i couldn't hold a glass of water without spilling it all out. Gradually the hallucinations became worse and more intense. I saw a man walk past me. He did not exist. But i saw him clear as day. The TV that was on in the background started flickering. The program moved back and forth, sometimes it froze. Sometimes i could hear music in my ears. Actual songs that I've heard before in my life. Very very real. At one point a woman started talking. A terrifying voice, commenting, about what i can't really recall. But what was said was being very logical and methodical. My heartbeat increased a few notches. I became really scared shitless.

I could no longer trust what i saw. I could no longer feel safe with what appeared in front of me. I was not delirious in such a way that i lost my sense of self or my location. But i understood that the things happening was batshit crazy. So i called the emergency number and got taken to emergency room where i spent a day getting  injections in the butt and intravenous fluid. Afterwards i was transferred to a psychiatric ward where i stayed for 10 days. Overall a veeeeery hurtful and shocking experience for me. But oddly enough I needed something ""serious"" or ""big"" happen to me in order to change myself. Something bad rarely occurs without also bringing something good with it, and vice versa. Now i oddly feel the urge to live... A feeling long forgotten, but a welcome surprise.

So far 30 days sober. And i tend to make that permanent. As for other people in a similar situation I want to say that it is never too late to stop the booze. Willpower and your motivation is rarely enough to tackle it. Believe me, I've tried so many times on my own. Don't be afraid to seek help.

PS. Upon feeling better i noticed i still had the tooth i thought i lost. It was all a play of the mind.. :o DS.",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991170763969421}"

Before marriage, I knew he had a problem with alcohol but perhaps I was naive or just plain dumb, but I didn't realize how severe the issue was until late. I don't want to get into much detail, but he did some pretty shitty things because he was drunk on several occasions, including the cops finding him drinking vodka in his car a few days before we got married. Anyway, I tried to help him in every possible way I could think of, including calling his family, insisting that he get back to therapy and medication, supporting him through his crisis, and so forth. Nothing helped. So two weeks ago, I surprised him while he was hiding drinking outside on the porch. I was upset, but he suggested that if he could be honest about it and tell me when he felt like having a beer, he would not have to hide anymore. Funny enough, I told him on multiple occasions that I would not get mad if he was honest and told me he felt like drinking instead of hiding and lying. It is always clear when he drinks because he changes to a completely different person, so it is hard to understand why he would lie. Well, moving forward, I accepted his suggestion, only to realize that maybe it was a big mistake. Between Sunday and last night, he brought home two bottles of wine and proceeded to drink them entirely. It feels like I just opened the Pandora box, and now he has a green light to just drown in booze. I genuinely don't feel comfortable talking to my friends about it and his family offers little support, despite knowing his situation. We live by ourselves with no family around (his relatives live on the other coast and I'm from a different country) and he is currently seeking a job, so he stays home all day. I love this man very much and I don't know what else I can do to help him. We don't really have any other problems but this. Anyone who went through something similar? Any thoughts are appreciated.

high school was extremely hard for me (as for many i assume.) i was hospitalized in a psych ward for suicide ideation and anorexia. i got frequent panic attacks at night because the thought of going back to school terrified me. when my panic attacks got really bad, i had a few drinks. it wasn't regular and it must have happened a dozens times in 1.5 years but it happened.

when i realized that my antidepressants weren't working, that i couldn't study no matter how hard i tried, i thought ""nothing more to lose."" i started drinking at night first, to help the suicidal thoughts. once i started drinking at 6pm and realized i could actually get up and get some things done (like clean my flat, do the dishes, etc.) the past month, i've been drinking non-stop every day from 12pm until i go to bed. i'd never blacked out so i thought it was fine.

a few nights ago, i was in park, already drunk. some people my age approached me and asked why i was alone outside at night. we started talking. they asked if i had any alcohol. of course i did, so i let them drink a bit. they asked if i wanted to come to their party, and i followed. they had vodka at their house so i took a few shots. i think that's why i blacked out; i'm used to drinking a 75 cl bottle of rum in an afternoon, but i must have taken 5 or 6 shots back to back on top of all the rum i had already had. the only thing i remember after that is a man in my flat. i woke up the next morning in my own bed (yay!) i was naked and still drunk from the night before. there was blood on my sheets. my arms and legs were bruised and i had a cut above my eyebrow. my door was locked from the inside.

i have no idea what happened. i'm not worried about what i did because i consider myself a good person and i don't think i could hurt someone even blackout drunk. i'm a bit more worried about what was done to me but as long as i don't remember, i should be fine. the thing is, as soon as i woke up, the first thing i wanted to do was kill myself. i had promised my mom i would be back the day after so i decided that getting drunk was the next best thing. i started drinking at 10am. then realized i had a driving lesson to attend. i went to my driving lesson and drove drunk without telling the monitor, which drove me to decide that i should stop drinking so i wouldn't endanger people's lives further.

i didn't drink for one day and a half. i didn't have physical withdrawal symptoms but i could only think about having a drink (or fifteen.) i ended up stealing my dad's alcohol. i didn't want to get caught so i drank so little i wasn't even drunk but i felt so so so much better with alcohol in my system.

drinking doesn't help my suicidal thoughts anymore. life is just more bearable when i don't see the time go by and slip away from me.

2021-04-26 03:25:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mys2oa/it_works/,It Works,"My name is Robert, and I am an alcoholic. Furthermore, I am a person who is recovered from countless addictions and behavioral challenges. I was like so many individuals who were lost and afraid that nothing would ever change. I remember feeling so isolated and alone as a child. I was so confused and scared that I would get lost in my tears. I remember lying in bed at night when I was five and six years old and wondering why it hurts so much being me.

As I grew older, the pain deepened. When your pain goes to the degree that my pain did, it sets up an interesting dynamic. We learn at an early age that we are just not comfortable in our skin. From the earliest of memories, I remember I wanted to be somebody else, doing something else, be somewhere else. I did not feel comfortable in my skin. I was never satisfied.

My family dynamic was that of an alcoholic father, a codependent mom, and I was the middle child of seven children. We grew up in a home that was always upside down, and trying to find my balance was impossible. I became the chameleon. I never knew what someone else wanted or how I could become what I had to become for others to accept me.

Maybe you can relate to these feelings that I had. By the time I was a teenager things became much worse. As a child, little is expected of you. As we grow, so do the expectations that others have for us. This was not only true in my family, my social circles, and even academically. Because I did not feel that I had value I did not believe I could produce anything of value. The hole gets deeper and deeper and deeper.

We end up in what I have heard termed “the hole of no hope.” When I was 14 years old, I took my first drink because I could get away with it. I remember how it made me feel once the alcohol hit my system. I went from being nothing to almost. When you come from nothing, are convinced you are always going to be nothing, being an almost is the top of the world. Every subsequent drink I took was an attempt to recapture that feeling of being an almost.

When one is convinced they will never amount to anything, being an almost is everything. In the beginning, it seems harmless enough and the frequency was based on the amount of emotional pain that I was feeling. I found as I got older, and my social circle grew, and my family and educational expectations grew, my anxiety of not measuring up grew as well. As I was constantly being reminded, the feeling that I was nothing grew, and so my need to be an almost grew proportionately.

Since I could not become almost on my own, I had to find the opportunity and the alcohol to be fulfilled. This is where the cycle became dangerous. My reliance was not on me feeling good about who I was. It was based on a substance that I found myself increasingly needing in frequency and amount.

When I turned 16 years old, I realized my drinking was getting out of control and had become obvious to others. It became necessary for me to experiment with other substances that would enhance my sensation that alcohol alone could no longer produce. In the beginning, a joint here and a joint there was sufficient, but that would make me tired and lethargic, and I was not left with a very adequate means to concentrate in school.

Someone introduced me to methamphetamines, and this helped keep me up and active during the day. Now instead of just drinking, I was smoking marijuana and eating amphetamines. The challenge with that was not eating, and I found it increasingly more difficult to sleep. That is when I began to introduce barbiturates into the rotation. Barbiturates were a very curious drug; that they did what alcohol was doing, but did it without the hangover. This went on and on until I got to my senior year in high school and on my 18th birthday, I decided to drop out of school.

It was January 3rd, and I would graduate that May. Nevertheless, my drinking and using career was needing my attention. I found it more important and more necessary to drink and use than what I thought a high school education could bring me. As the years passed and my struggles became greater, there was not a relationship or an opportunity that I was not willing to set aside to drink and use.

By the time I was 27 years old, I had become chronic in my addiction. I had added compulsive gambling, overeating, pornography, and I started throwing up three to five times per day. I was at the end of my rope and I knew that if something did not change, I was going to die. I knew there were no more chances for me.

On February 9th of 1986, I entered treatment and admitted I was an alcoholic. I was introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12 step groups. I began my pursuit of recovery. I began going to meetings and meeting new people. I was enjoying what I was finding in the rooms of recovery. Nevertheless, I found it so difficult in being honest with others.

I was sincerely afraid that you would find out that I was nothing. I knew that if I spoke too much or became too honest, you would figure that out and I would be the first person in the history of a 12-step program that you would ask not to come back. I know that sounds laughable to some, but it was a real fear for me.

Once again, I knew that something had to change, or I was going to die. I knew honesty was the best path for me, yet being honest was almost as fearful as the death that was waiting for me. Sadly, that led to my relapse after 71 days of being sober.

Fortunately for me, I only found it necessary to drink for five days. I was trying to recapture that feeling of being an almost. At the end of those five days, I realized that the only place for me was back in the rooms of recovery. On April 25th of 1986, I walked back into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have never left.

That means that as of April 25th of 2021, I am celebrating 35 years of personal recovery. Even more astounding than 35 years is that it translates into 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to my addiction. The journey has been remarkable.

There have been some challenges along the way, but then again, life is filled with challenges. I will never forget what it was like being a newcomer. It was the most frightening thing that I had ever experienced and yet I could not leave because I knew that I would die.

I realized that the only way for me to stay clean and sober and to become happy, joyous, and free was to apply the plan of recovery to the best of my ability. I made it my passion to go to meetings, get and work with my sponsor and become acclimated to a power greater than myself. As I did those things and began incorporating the 12 steps into my personal life things began to change in ways that I could have only dreamed of.

I went from being a nothing and an occasional almost to somebody who had more hope than anyone I had ever met. I began to resemble the people that I had met in the rooms of recovery. I began living and sharing some of the stories that I had heard them share with me.

When I would hear them share those stories my heart began to dance and sing, and I wished that those things would happen to me. They have happened to me and so many more. I cannot imagine a life that does not include one day at a time (ODAAT) and living a plan of recovery. I can honestly tell you for nearly all my 35 years of personal recovery, I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and peace in anticipation because of what I have been so freely given.

I meet many people who are struggling the way I had struggled. I speak with many individuals who are trying to find the magic that would take them from dying a lonely death to a life of personal fulfillment and that surpasses all understanding. This is what I have found in my recovery journey. I was so fortunate that I met so many amazing people along the way.

Every person of significance to me, (outside of one who died during a relapse) is either clean and sober today or has passed away in sobriety. When I mentioned these individuals, I am talking about people who are sober 37, 39, 41, and 44 years. My sponsor Jack passed away two years ago with 44 years of personal recovery. Individuals like Texas Mike, Pete the Greek, Russian Ted, and Doc Irv all passed away as recovered members of the 12 Step Program.

One of the most exciting things about the plan of recovery that I followed is that it is a complete blueprint. When followed, the likelihood of having all the things it promises is all but guaranteed. I don't mean to say that everyone who starts the program of Alcoholics Anonymous finishes or lives a sober life.

What I am saying is I have never known anyone to relapse when they followed the path. After my relapse back in 1986, I was face to face with how dangerous I was to myself. The prospect of another relapse scared me more than I had ever been scared. I asked my sponsor what I needed to do to never relapse again. The answer was simple. The answer is service.

When I decided to incorporate the plan of recovery into my life for the express purpose of becoming more equipped to help others it completely revolutionized my thinking. I was no longer about me. It was about “we.” Developing this way of thinking was transformational for me.

A section in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous talks about selfishness and self-centeredness being foundational to every problem I had ever had. Setting aside my ego is the best thing I could ever do.

Growing in sobriety has been the greatest journey one will ever take. That is exactly what recovery is. Recovery is a journey; it is not a destination. I am so glad that there is a finish line other than death.

My goal is to accomplish what my sponsor Jack Fisher accomplished. Jack sadly succumbed to cancer a little more than two years ago. At the time of his death, Jack had 44 years of continuous sobriety. As I chatted with him in his hospital room and knowing it would be the last time I was to see him alive, I asked him “Jack, what do I tell them? What is your message you want me to share with others?” Jack looked at me with his cancer sunken eyes and said “Bob, tell them it works.”

That simple phrase has resonated with me in different ways. The most important way it resonated with me is that it underscored the simplicity of what we're doing. There is no magic. There is no wondering if or how or when. The program of recovery works when you work it.

My message to you - and I want you to hear this loud and clear - is it works. I see so often people in social media bashing one recovery program or another.

Here's the deal, they all work. When you look at some of the programs within the monotheistic religions of the world and other secular programs, they work. There are far too many people who have been successful to suggest that they don't work. The common denominator of anything less than success is not the program, it is the person applying the program.

The opening paragraph in Chapter 5 of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous reads “rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.” End of the story. I am fully convinced that when we apply the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and the plan as laid out in the first 164 pages of recovery, our result will be permanent sobriety.

I also believe this to be true with the Muslim Faith, Judaism, LDS Recovery, Celebrate Recovery, the Buddhist Network, and the list goes on and on. If you are involved in any of these programs or find a program where it has been demonstrated that it has worked for countless others, then guess what, if it doesn't work it is you. Why not humble ourselves?

Why not be as honest as only a dying person can be honest? I love the simplicity of the program as it states all we need to be is honest, open-minded, and willing. If we are these three things daily, there is never any reason for us to go back out again. So many people go out and never come back.

I count myself so fortunate to be a person who relapsed, found the doors of recovery still open, and gave it another go. As I wrap up this message to you today, I want you to know how grateful I am to have been given the gift of recovery. When I consider myself to have been clean and sober for 3 1/2 decades I am beyond grateful. What is even more astounding is that today is day 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to death.

The areas in my life that I have been given are beyond, but I believe I deserve it. I have a marriage of 32 years. My children that I abandoned at the height of my addiction have forgiven me and we have a loving and working relationship that is in a continual process of heightened healing.

I don't regret who I am. Matter of fact, I celebrate who I am. I am no longer a person who came from nothing and would remain a nothing. My goal is no longer to be almost. Today I am somebody filled with hope, potential, and a satisfying heart of helping others achieve what I have been able to achieve.

I hope you are one that I can pass this mantle onto as you are beginning or continuing your journey of recovery. I have been blessed, fortunate, and honored to go from broken to whole. I desire to teach and guide others to find their way.

There will come a time that I am as Jack was. I will be laying in a hospital bed getting close to my last breath and someone that I love and who loves me will ask me what my message is that they can pass on. My message to them will simply be “it works.”

2021-04-25 15:49:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/myg0d6/my_so_just_entered_treatment_again/,My S/O just entered treatment again,"On Friday I dropped my s/o off at a treatment center. Thursday morning she came in my office with her insurance provider on the phone. She was calling to find out about in-home treatment programs, which her insurance would not cover, but she was determined to try and make happen. The provider picked up on her level of intoxication and told her she needed to go to ER immediately for fear of complications from withdrawal. I dropped what I was doing and we went straight to the ER. I knew in my heart this was the opportunity to get her into treatment. 

The ER was busy and we waited over 6 hours to be seen, all the while she was telling me to go home and that she would take an Uber back. When she was called in to do blood work I got on the phone with her insurance provider to find out about in-network treatment providers. I learned that the in-home service she wanted to try used medical billing codes the provider did not accept, so we ruled that option out quickly. I knew about a treatment center that offered detox and has a great track record of helping people build a foundation for success in 12-step work. They were in-network! 

I reached out to friends and family. This is the place, the time is now, we need your support. Everyone was on board. Finally, we both met with the doctor who was astonished at her BAC, over .4 after several hours of not drinking. She was about to recommend treatment when I interjected. I found a place where she can go, beds are available. Here’s why in-home will not work, insurance limitations. Doctor was immediately on board and brought in the social worker. Together they were magnificent and I’m so grateful for the compassion and coordination they provided. She didn’t resist and the decision was ultimately her own. 

The following day was tough. She was given some Librium to help with her withdrawals and spent the day packing. We took the ride together, along with our 8 m/o puppy, and got her admitted Friday afternoon. There’s no contact for the first week while she is in detox, and although I am grateful for this opportunity, my heart hurts for the pain she must be feeling. 

So now it’s just me, the dog and H.P.. I’m here to tell you this story because I’m hopeful, yet I’m not attached to the outcome. I accept the things I cannot change, and my courage to change the things I can has given me a spiritual freedom that has allowed me to show up for this person with whom I love deeply, without judgment. I will continue to work on myself because it is the only thing I can really do for others. I feel the pain and sadness of longing for my companion, but I know that she has not been able to show up for life, and even when she is near she is not present. I will not resist the feelings I am having, I will welcome them with an open heart. 

Don’t give up. There is hope. This program works if you work it, and you work it cause you’re worth it.

2021-04-25 15:08:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/myf5bc/love_to_and_questions_for_those_family_and/,Love to and questions for those family and friends affected by a person with alcoholism,"TLDR: Scroll to bottom for two questions that this post is aiming to answer. I'm trying to gather preliminary information, to eventually try to help people have an easier time going through supporting someone with alcoholism. This long post is just for context, and provides some of my own personal story. 

Huge love, respect, and empathy to those dealing with alcoholism, on both sides of the situation (loved one / alcoholic). To the alcoholic, this post is not to diminish your experience and situation or say that it's more or less important than that of the people in your life.  I hope you find and use the support, community, resources, courage, guidance, empowerment, resilience, and self love that you need to get through this. However, this post is for the ones indirectly affected by alcohol - the family, friends, coworkers, etc. Apologies if I use any incorrect terminology or cause any triggers, please let me know if I can do better in any way.  I am pretty new to speaking publicly about this and my intention is to gather information in hopes of creating a community of support for loved ones. 

I am the daughter of an alcoholic, and I am very grateful that I can now say that after decades, in his mid-60s, my dad has been sober for over 3 years and we are rebuilding our relationship. I won't get into the details in this post, it's too long. However, his journey has inspired me and I am in awe every day at his transformation and humility over the entire thing. 

My story is going to be both similar and different to others, and I know all of our stories are going to have their own beginning and end, obstacles and advantages, but I have to start somewhere and my story is all that I really know. I look forward to hearing about and learning from yours, and hopefully passing these learnings on to others.

The process leading up to his detox and treatment was traumatic for both my brother and I, and the actual process of the detox, treatment, and aftermath, was the hardest thing I've ever gone through in my life. It was worth it, but I feel like our society (I live in Canada) is NOT built for this, is not ready for this, doesn't have the/enough resources, and is an epidemic that is only going to get worse as alcoholism runs rampant in our communities and quite under the radar. We need better resources, out in the open and easily available. When you Google things like ""how to support a loved one in detox"" or ""how to support a family member going through alcoholic treatment"", most of the websites that come up are for alcohol treatment centers, or addiction resources for the alcoholic themselves. Not enough is easily visible for those who are also experiencing serious indirect health (mental and physical) consequences of alcoholism.  

I want to make it clear that I am aware of and a huge supporter of Al-Anon, as that's the first thing that comes to peoples' minds. It was extremely helpful and I still carry and use the tools I learned from that community almost daily. But there is SO MUCH more that the people recovering from the process of dealing with this need. And not everyone resonates with approaching Al-Anon for support, for whichever reason, it's just how it goes.  

Whether you're a husband, wife, daughter, son, roommate, best friend, coworker etc., you are affected by this person's alcoholism. I'm not going to get into the details of this, or how alcoholism works, what causes it, or how to help the alcoholic, there are plenty of other very helpful resources and people with great knowledge on this and is a whole other topic. And this is not to shame or make any alcoholic feel guilty for the affect their alcoholism has on people around them. This is an attempt to open another conversation that is extremely difficult to have, partly BECAUSE it feels terrible to admit that someone we love can hurt us so much, without worrying about hurting their feelings by telling them that.

\*This part triggers me to re-read so again, warning. What I want to talk about is how helpless, anxious, fearful, alone, frustrated, angry, resentful, sad, and even shameful, someone can feel when going through this. Specifically, the process of witnessing the alcoholic going through full-on detox, wondering when leaving detox where do they go next, not getting much help from the hospital (I understand why, it's not their job to provide counseling, it's just a gap that I see), wondering how are we going to afford the treatment/rehab if he even goes, trying to convince someone to go (who is experiencing delusions and doesn't even remember), oh there's a 6 month waiting list unless you have $20,000? Who's going to take care of dad while he physically recovers, how can he go home after this without going to treatment, we have to work we don't have time or $ to help, the hospital wants to release him but he can't even walk up the stairs because his body is so exhausted from detox, how can he possibly go home without rehab  but we are still waiting to find out where he can go.... what's going to happen, and **why are we responsible for deciding**? 

SO MANY QUESTIONS, NO CLEAR ANSWERS. There just are not enough easily-accessible resources out there to support these heavy feelings. And nobody talks about this. I'm sure I have several family and friends and coworkers who have or are going through this, but it's considered shameful, secret, and nobody shares this openly. 

In crisis mode, it's so hard to find answers to questions like ""how do I help this person"", but also completely off the radar to ask ""how do I help myself so that I can get through this and support this person the best way that I can without compromising my own sanity"". 

I was lucky to eventually find support over weeks, months, years.... through reaching out to a generous family friend, a consultant who basically specializes in connecting alcoholics with treatment centers, a personal and family counselor (free), a hospital social worker, my doctor, Al-Anon, etc.; and I was fortunate enough to learn the importance of and have the privilege to add yoga, meditation, good friends, a week-long program for family members (codependency bootcamp, basically), a counselor (paid), and a job that allowed me to take time off to do these things. 

But the point of this long-winded post is to say that my passion now is to try to relieve even an ounce of this pressure on loved ones by collecting information and hopefully providing another resource to help those in crisis mode and afterward. I want to provide a point of salvation during those moments of panic-Googling, with the hope of giving someone a tidbit of helpful information to let them know there IS support out there, all kinds, and that it is a holistic process, that is about SO much more than just helping the alcoholic. 

\*\* The place I want to start is to ask you - if you're going through this now, or have gone through this before, first of all you are not alone and I care about you so much and want you to know that you will get through this. But what I would like to know is:

\- what do you feel like you need right now but can't find

\- what was/were the most helpful thing(s) for you when you were going through this?

Thank you for reading this and for caring about your loved one, and yourself. This journey sucks but can also be extremely rewarding. Stick with it, and reach out. <3",5,{'epidemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.954009473323822}"
2021-04-25 14:55:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/myeus1/seizure_possible_liver_damage_toxicity_in_red/,"seizure, possible liver damage, toxicity in red blood cells, withdrawal, panic attacks (trigger warning mention of eating disorder)","hey guys. im new to reddit and this is my first post but I rlly need to reach out. im a 22 year old female, I hardly ever eat, and up until a few days ago I was consuming about 10-14 drinks pretty much every single day. if I don't drink I go through different kinds of withdrawal, be it nausea, dry heaving, cold sweats, shaking to the point where I can't move, severe panic attacks where I can't breathe and I feel like my chest is closing in, inability to eat, horrible headaches, foggy/clouded vision, constant dissociation and feeling of dread and suicidal ideations. I could go on. I've reached a point in my alcoholism where I rarely ever even drink to have fun anymore, its usually just so I don't get sick from withdrawals. last summer I had a seizure after going on a drinking bender for a few weeks; I was so hungover and burnt out and sick that I physically couldn't drink anything even if I wanted to, so I just stayed in bed all day, didn't drink, and then maybe 12 hours later I ended up having a seizure on the floor. my guess is it was because this was the longest I had gone without drinking in weeks. I should also add that I hadn't really eaten anything in days, aside from little snacks like apples, carrots, hummus, (side note: I do suffer from anorexia nervosa as well. what a combo!!!) so it was probably a mix of not eating, and drinking a heavy amount continuously for days, throughout the days, and then just suddenly stopping. and honestly I really thought that would be my wake up call- but it wasn't. the next day I was out of the hospital I was back to drinking again.

so fast forward to now. my mental health has plummeted, I thought it was bad before but it has reached a new low. as previously stated, up until a few days ago I was consuming about 10-14 drinks a day. I was in an incredibly abusive relationship for the past 8 months which brought the drinking to an all time high, to the point where I wouldn't be able to fall asleep unless I was black out drunk and I would wake up the next morning panicking and I wouldn't be able to calm my nerves or stop shaking unless I had a drink. but the other day, I went to the doctor and I found out I have high enzyme levels in my liver, and toxicity in my red blood cells, both most likely caused by my alcoholism, and poor diet. I have to go back for more tests in a month or 2. they kept reassuring me I would be fine but I don't think they realize how bad my alcoholism is. I was upfront with them about it, but they were just specialists working in an internal care unit of the hospital so they didn't really have much knowledge of alcoholism in general. they basically just asked me if I could stop drinking for 2 weeks before the tests, and if I could try to lower my intake drastically as soon as possible, but not to stop drinking immediately in case of another seizure. im absolutely floored... like Im genuinely terrified. I just turned 22 a month ago, im so fucking young, I never thought this would happen to me. I feel like such a fucking idiot for continuously telling myself I would be fine and I could deal with this myself.

I know what I need to do now, I clearly need to seek some sort of rehabilitation, whether it be addictions counselling or a group program (I'm not thrilled about AA, I don't believe in ""god"" or a higher power in general and it seems like that's kind of how its fuelled, but at this point im pretty open to anything), but good god i'm fucking terrified. even trying to slow my intake down has been hard. I had 7 drinks last night, and I had maybe 6 the day before. I'm so scared, I always say I want to die but I don't want to now and not like this. I never thought I would get this bad, I never thought I would get to this point but it's even worse than I could've imagined. I don't know how to stop the panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, constant feeling of dread and loneliness and just general pain that im constantly in. alcohol was the way I coped with that. im on a waiting list for therapy right now which is something I guess, but I don't know how much longer I can wait. fuck fuck fuck. im so terrified. I feel like I have no sort of grip on my life right now.

sorry for the dramatically long and emotional post, I just wanted to know if anyone has ever been through anything similar I guess, and if they got better? and I guess I could just use a bit of support. thanks to whoever made it all the way through this.

EDIT: sorry for all the grammatical errors I wrote this pretty frantically. but thank you so much to everyone who has reached out with kind and motivating words <3. this support is deeply appreciate right now and you're all lovely.

&#x200B;

EDIT X2: guys seriously thank you so much for all the support, I don't know if I would've had the courage to call the rehabilitation centre on my own, but with all the motivation from this community I did. I start an outpatient program at a rehabilitation centre in my city on May 20th (wait times are pretty long here cuz the healthcare system succccks, but at least its covered by insurance!). I have an abdominal ultra-sound to check everything out on May 13th. And.... I've tapered down to 4 drinks a day!

I'm honestly really proud of myself, that's less than half my regular consumption in a week. I think my physical health has already improved slightly, I had little to no energy before and I now have motivation to exercise and go outside again, I haven't woken up shaking the past two mornings (first time in so long...), and I just feel a lot clearer-headed in general. I don't want to be overly optimistic, I know I have a long journey towards recovery ahead of me and I'm sure knowing myself there will be plenty of bumps along the way, but for the first time in months I honestly feel really hopeful. and if it's even just drastically slowing down for now until I start my outpatient program, that's good enough for me. as long as I make it to the final goal eventually. thank you so much everyone. this is seriously a really wonderful online community.",28,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977490305900574}"

2021-04-25 08:53:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/my7qs2/cannot_be_cured/,Cannot be cured.,"Coming to terms with the fact I’ll never be the same again is an emotional roller-coaster. 

At first your body floods with fear and anxious excitement as you slowly click up the steep incline to the start of the track course. Your heart is racing as you traverse the peak and you grip onto the handlebars for dear life. Akin to the way you grab the handle of the exit door of the rehab you spent drying out, the door opens and you now come flying down the tracks of your own personal roller-coaster ride. 

Flying down the tracks at full speed the anxiety, fear and excitement is at an all time peak. Everything seems new and fascinating, all while the danger looms inherently behind you. A slip of the tracks now could present a very real threat of relapse or even worse death. There is no getting off the ride once you’ve had your ticket punched.

Alcoholism is something that cannot be cured, plain and simple. The experts say its “manageable” and people can lead fulfilling lives without alcohol but the danger is always there. 

Put simply alcoholics will never be able to consume alcohol without it consuming them.

That’s an extremely hard pill to swallow and it wasn’t until my 4th year sober that I actually agreed with the above sentiment. Myself like other’s I suppose foolhardy believed that one day I could have a few beers and relax. However the longer I travelled on those roller-coaster tracks and the more I learnt about alcoholism and myself, I slowly realised such a thing was unattainable. Its such a kick to the stomach to know you’ve damaged your body and brain to the point of no return and alot of things will never be the same again.

Certain things will always be a trigger for an alcoholic and there’s no easy way around that besides learning to live with you demons and manage your lifestyle appropriately. 

Personally speaking I can’t stand the smell of beer, it literally makes my insides spin like a hurricane and sends signals to my brain so hard and fast, that it gives me immediate flashbacks. Being around people who are extremely intoxicated is another big one for me, I feel like I’m on that roller-coaster again because I see myself in that drunk person. 

A rabbit isn’t virtuous, it just can’t do anything except get eaten. Its not virtuous. If your a monster and don’t act monstrously, then your virtuous. (Jordan Peterson) 

Although I will always technically be a “recovered alcoholic” I wear that shit like a badge of honour on my chest, shoulders back and with my head held high. I have bad days, I have bad weeks even but I can take solace in the fact I know I was a monster and how monstrous I can be but I’m not that person anymore. 

Being an a recovered alcoholic I’m forever on the roller-coaster and that’s just how my life is now. 4 years without alcohol in my life but the horrific dreams, stomach churns when I smell beer or the awkward social interactions still remain. In those times it feels like I’m at the start of the tracks again, going full speed on the roller-coaster down ramp and absolutely shitting myself as I get thrown into the triple loop. However when I come out the other side of the loop, fuck it feels good. I’m proud of myself and reminded why I put the bottle down. I’m still learning everyday to manage life on the tracks I chose, but as the days and years go on I get better at enjoying the ride.

Getting sober was and continues to be the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But without a shadow of a doubt, it’s also been the best thing I’ve done by far. Being the son, brother and partner people can count on and respect is something I always wanted to give. After alot of blood, sweat and tears I’m finally in the position to achieve exactly that. Being there for my newborn niece has been a huge eye opener for me, I can’t wait to see her grow up and now I’m not a hopeless drunk I get to be apart of her life and see all those cherished moments.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8957726359367371}"
2021-04-25 06:18:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/my5g44/alcoholism_and_distance/,Alcoholism and distance,"A good friend moved away a few years ago. We were both expats, so we got our families together for holidays, and we regularly hung out outside of the pub, though I had a weekly reminder that Tuesdays was pub night.

Our relationship wasn't just about drinking, but I would be lying if I didn't say drinks weren't present and since he left I drink significantly less.

His leaving was rough, and since then we've stayed in touch a bit, exchanging holiday greetings, the occasional call and but when my kid was born he called regularly to check in, because there were complications and he'd had his first in the same hospital with the same doctor, so despite the distance he was someone to confide in.

Before the pandemic work brought him back for a brief visit, so he got to meet my kid and we spent a night the out, favourite restaurant followed by one of our favourite pubs.

After total silence for months, he called, apologized for the mostly one sided conversation over the past year of me texting him and not hearing a word back, and wanted me to know why. 

He told me about how 2020 had been a struggle, he lost love ones to COVID, he'd admitted his alcoholism, he'd gone into rehab, was now in a sober house, and was afraid of losing his family. 

We spoke for a long time, I reminded him of all the times we'd spent together, how I'd often think about everything he did for his kids and that was a real inspiration for me when I had my first and how despite the distance he can call or write anytime, and that I'd answer. I told him I'd keep up with the texting and voice mails and he can get back whenever he wants. He said thanks and that he'd try to keep in touch.

Two months have gone by and again not a word, despite me trying to keep up with weekly messages. So decided to be blunt reached out to his wife. She let me know more about the situation and was surprised that we weren't speaking, because he would often tell her about the things I wrote, so he's reading but not replying. She let me know that she would reach out if things get better or worse, in case he doesn't.

I know he needs connections, but I'm a world away and can't do much. So my question is should I be doing? What should I be sharing? At the moment I don't write things like ""hang in there"" I instead write about how my kid is growing, daily life, politics, stupid memes, things that we'd be talking and laughing about if we weren't continents apart.

I want to help, but I'm concerned that I'm going about this wrong and seeing as there's a fear that he could hurt himself, I don't want to be an annoying reminder of what he's missing either.

I have learned to keep you at a distance, for the next time to you hurt me. I tell you, you need to go as tears stream down my face, but you don't budge. My husband, the man you gave me away to asked you to leave nicely before things escalated. You insulted him, you provoked him. We didn't argue because of you. We argued because he wouldn't ignore you. You were asking for negative attention. I refuse to give in. I won't text you, I scold not you but him, for giving into your need for this negative attention.

I know your disease controls this side of you. But I don't feel bad for the relationship you gave up on, I feel bad for the relationship you ruined between you, your wife, and me. She is wonderful now that she understands how you are, she doesn't judge me for the actions I took as a teenager, I think she understands now. I think she knows I care and love her. 

I fear that now because of you she will feel uncomfortable to see me, that she will not reach out to me. I fear that once again you have tried to take a roll model from me. I feel ask if she deserved me as a daughter. That even though we had to over come the normal step daughter-mother awkwardness she knows I care about her. 

You are responsible. But all's I can do is wait. 

I wait for you to accept responsibility, as I wait I try to forgive. I don't know if I will forgive. I tell myself I forgave you last time because of grandpa and grandma but really it had been 2 years and I was ready to get to know you sober again. Little did I know you were actually not sober. I lied to myself and I am not sure I will every be ready to have this battle again.",9,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9602083563804626}"

We are close in that we share a lot of common interest but for the most part she has always spent most of her time at work or in her room. 

I have witnessed her coming home drunk and passed out, halfway through the doorway. I would have to shake her awake. I have gone out drinking with her in the past and always her short term memory is shot. She would lose her phone, wallet, keys all the time. Always thought it would be her mixing alcohol with her medication. She takes a lot of medication for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. 

At the beginning of the pandemic she started to have seizures. Her first one was after heavy drinking through the day. The day after she had a seizure. She has gotten every test done to figure out what is causing them with no answers from the doctors. She has had 6 seizures that I have know. about over the last year and a couple months. 

Three weeks ago her office opened back up to allow them to work from the office instead of home. She said she was super excited about it. The morning of her going back she got a liter of vodka before work. I don’t have proof she drank all of it but that morning she also asked me for some Adderall since she was out. Later on she reported not feeling well so her mom came to get her. Her mother said she smelled of alcohol and had a seizure later that night. 

At her parent’s house, her mom found several empty bottles in her dirty hamper. At our apartment her room looks like a homeless person lives there. I found a couple empty bottles as well. 

I am not sure if she is still drinking now that she is back at the apartment. She had two dogs in her room and they will bark for bloody murder and she won’t even move. She hides drinking from me so I can’t tell if she is drinking now and that is why she is out cold. Also not sure if that is the reason for the seizures. 

Not sure if it is related but she sleeps in freezing weather. I don’t know what to do. After I told her mother about the bottles I found in her room she decided to move out. She says it’s because she needs to be walking distance from work. I don’t believe her and she doesn’t think she has any problem. Are these red flags that she has problem with alcohol?

They checked my blood alcohol level and it said 0.00 that was the first time  in idk how long I could say that I was completely sober.

When I went in I was at my most Vulnerable state I have ever been in and it was the most traumatizing moment of my whole life.

Today I have a lot of emotions to think where I once was a year ago. How I had let alcohol take over my life and keep me locked up in this cage I could never get out of. It put me in a place where I weak, scared, and had no voice.

When I went into the hospital I was looked at and treated like someone who was on drugs and was told over and over again I was a heroin addict because how sick I was. Shaking, unable to breathe or stand on my own the nurse could careless. After getting assessed by the nurse they took me to a room to lay down on a bed

This was the beginning of Covid and the hospital was out of masks. They had paper towels folded in half with rubber bands stapled to the sides. They put one on me when I first got there. I already couldn’t breathe as it was and they tell me to lay down to put in an IV. When I laid down the paper towels went into my mouth and nose. I was suffocating 

I sat up so I could breathe. The nurse called for for someone to come put in the IV. When someone came to help she got on the bed and held the mask over my mouth and nose making it so I couldn’t breathe at all. 

As I laid there in tears thinking this was how I was going to die. Thinking I put myself here. Making myself so weak and vulnerable I could not fight back. It was the scariest moment of my life.

She held the mask over my face she yelled “Lay the fuck down! We’re in the middle of a pandemic you little shit!” I had used my last drop of energy trying to sit up so holding me down wasn’t something she needed to do. I wasn’t fighting because I couldn’t. I was on the verge of passing out so she climbed off the table so I could breathe. Heroin

After multiple try’s they finally got the IV in. The nurse continued to say I was on heroin and treated me like it too. She asked if I was cold because I was shaking, but then told me that sucks. A doctor would come in and turn off the lights so I could rest and she would come in the room just to turn them on because a drug addict doesn’t deserve sleep. After being there for what felt like a lifetime, I finally had stop shaking and had gained some strength back. When the nurse came back in and started telling me that I was on Heroin again I used everything I had in me to yell at her “I don’t do fucking heroin!!!!” She called me a lair and left the room. 

She came back into the room and told me she had talked to my husband. My husband told her that I had a substance abuse problem. She then yelled at me saying that when someone says they have a substance abuse problem that means drugs not alcohol. She told me that alcohol is not a substance. Never once did she apologize. Never once did she even look like she felt bad. It was seriously the scariest moment of my whole life. 

Fucked up people are out there and will take advantage of you when ur that weak it’s soooo horrible. But everyone has a different path to sobriety but I pray to god yours is nothing like mine. You just gotta tell yourself your better then all this!! Don’t put yourself in the position I did, don’t make urself almost die to get sober. Do it for you, do it to be happy again, do it to feel good inside and out! I can honestly say sobriety is a beautiful thing and will make life so much better you just gotta believe in yourself.... and I believe in you... you can do this just be strong",0,"{'covid': 1, 'mask': 3, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965053796768188}"

I'm gonna need you.,"I'm celebrating 66 days sober today (I'll be turning 65 next week). I was a functional alcoholic, I guess. I came from a family of them; well, at least my parents. My two younger brothers both let their addiction impact their careers and both paid for it but have gotten thru and are now on to the better side of themselves.

I had been self employed running my own business since 1992. Maybe that's why my alcoholism never impacted my career. Or maybe it did and I just didn't notice. Who knows? I retired shortly after COVID started rearing its ugly head in 2020 so I've felt kinda safe and snug by staying out of the way.

I have a cancer issue that was diagnosed back in 2017. It's (pretty much) under control but I still have to go back and see expensive docs at least three times a year. On my last visit with my cancer specialist (2/18), he pressed me once again with how much I drank. I gave him the same answer I give all my docs, the same one I gave him the last time we met: I do about 3 to 4 stiff drinks a night (actually, that would have been when I started consuming late in the evening. If I'd been honest with him, I would have admitted to being a much heavier drinker than that). His face tensed up and he began telling me to cut back, claiming my blood test showed that my liver enzymes were really not good.

I dared him: Tell me to stop. He said: Stop. I said OK. And I've been sober since. I've been lucky, tho. COVID has shut down any interest in 'going out'. I can't remember the last time I went to a party so I've never had to 'turn down' the opportunity for a free drink. My wife and I have basically hibernated for the past 16 months and, as opposed to years past, we have never had reason to travel away from each other for work or family obligations during this time. Meaning: I've always had somebody around me; I've never had to be alone...and tempted.

So, both my wife and I are fully vaccinated and this spring/summer is already filling with a lot of social activities. I know we'll be getting back out in public. I live in the south. Alcohol will be as much a part of these events as the pretty girls in slinky summer dresses. My wife, who still drinks, will be going with her girlfriends on several 'long' weekend summer breakaways. It's going to be a very tempting time to 'take a sip' here or there. I'm committed not to.

I am a female in my 20’s who drank for 8 years as a poor means to cope after being drugged and raped by a coworker whom I trusted. I had no support from my parents after it happened, both drinkers who blamed me for the assault. I turned to booze for comfort. Over those years, I would have short periods of sobriety, but always fell off the wagon until I became too addicted to stop without withdrawal. It wasn’t until last year around the time that lockdown was in full effect that it all caught up with me.

I was taking ADHD medication prescribed to me and drinking about 1/3-1/2 of a bottle of vodka every night. The effects were extremely dehydrating and I began to have pains that I assumed were from kidney stones, as the pain was similar. I tried treating myself as if I had kidney stones for a week or so. I stopped being able to go to work due to the pain and lost my job. I was urinating blood and vomiting every time I tried to eat. I wasn’t processing food. I had the worst panic attacks of my life.

It got so bad that I finally went to the ER. They took my blood and when there was a shift change the doctor tossed my results at me and said I was fine, not discussing them. I took those results to my GP who told me that my liver levels were very bad and I needed to admit myself to detox because I was reaching a critical state.

I detoxed inpatient for over a week; slowly, I was able to eat and go to the bathroom normally. After all of that, I was basically scared straight. There were moments of extreme temptation and struggle, but I managed to make it a year. I was proud.

Then I got the first stage of the Covid vaccine on April 4th.

My partner and I both experienced extreme fatigue but I couldn’t even get out of bed and my lower back and area near my liver hurt a little again. I thought it would go away, but the pains remain. Not as bad as when it was at its worst a year ago, but definitely noticeable. I went and had my labs done for my psych office to determine what medications would be acceptable after trying to resume ADHD meds proved to irritate my liver again. My lower back has hurt so bad since that vaccine that I can’t even bend over to pull my skirts up and my fiancé has to help me.

I went online to see the results after the pain got a little worse. My AST and sodium are both one point above being in the red. Both linked to kidneys and the liver.

I started crying when I saw, wondering if I’m not going to live a long life with my love. Wondering if I’ll never get to finish school and follow creative pursuits, explore the world. All because I emulated my parents and coped poorly.

I have a doctor’s appointment next week and I’m scared of what they’ll say. I’ve looked up liver damage and apparently it’s irreversible. Kidney damage looks even more grim upon searches. I’m not even in my 30s yet and wondering how long I might have.

I was so excited and proud to make it a year. Now I’m just terrified.

Does anyone know people who have survived something like this?

He is a high functioning alcoholic.  I've never mentioned alcoholism to his face as it's not my place to judge his relationship with alcohol but it always concerned me. He has never described himself as an alcoholic, however all of his behaviors point in that direction. He had mentioned how his brother is an alcoholic and he doesn't want to end up like his brother but I see their behaviors as very similar. My family and I have discussed how much he drank and we all care for him and want to help. I personally hardly drink and came from a family that didn't drink either, his family is the opposite. 

Him and I had 2 major discussions over the past 6 months about how I notice his alcohol dependency and how he may be using it as an unhealthy coping mechanism for depression and emotions. He agreed with me. The discussions were very civil and we never exchanged harsh words but it was the first major life talk we had together as a couple and it was hard. 

Long story short, I want to hear from others that have realized that they have alcohol dependency and are high functioning and how it makes you feel or why you turned to substances? How do you navigate relationships and how have your partners been supportive of you?

We all have trauma and childhood issues we haven't dealt with. When I started drinking, I was covering the scars, and it worked. It worked like a mf-er. It was putting aloe vera and ice on a burn that had been there for some time. The burn didn't hurt anymore, as long as I had the aloe with me at the ready.

So I kept with the aloe and ice. As the pain became more intense, I thought I was still using that aloe. 

Somewhere along the line - I still can't pinpoint exactly when - that aloe became acid. Every time I used it, the burn got bigger and more widespread. But I couldn't stop. Now the burn is not only the original burn, but what I've added to it.

I finally did stop, with the proper literature, friendships, and professional help. But now I have a much larger burn to deal with. But that's ok, because now I'm focusing on much better things, talking through therapy and with friends, and hoping one day, I don't feel that burn any more.

Before I start, I want to let you know that I am contacting my doctor soon, when I muster up the courage. I just wanted some secondhand advice.

For the last 5-6 months or so, maybe, I’ve been drinking nightly. Not super hard stuff.. just 4.2% beers. Typically it’s around 6-10 beers a night. Sometimes it’s 4-6. Usually I start drinking at around 5 on my days off. When I work I come home around midnight. I get pretty bad brain fog and anxiety when I hold off that late, but I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. I just get scared that I’m going to have a seizure in the middle of my workplace or something.

My health anxiety since then has gotten pretty out of hand. I want to stop, but I’m absolutely terrified of withdrawals. Mortified of seizures and the like. I work all the time and can’t readily take time off to detox. Like I said, I plan on contacting my doctor, but I want to know what exactly I should expect. What kind of withdrawals typically come with this level of drinking? Do you think I’m at risk for something dangerous?

On my lunch breaks I'd always get wine at 7/11 and drink it in my car before going back to work. 

Since then, I've been drinking at least a full bottle of wine daily. I relocated to NV, my grandma overdosed, my mom had a mental breakdown, and I'm living with them both. Every day I go to the liquor store and get wine and now have graduated to vodka. I even drank a few mini-bottles of wine on my lunch break before going back to work. Being in NV doesn't help, as it is all casinos and liquor stores. 

I feel ashamed, I know I should stop, I was sober for so fucking long (other than marijuana, but I worked at a dispensary and it helps my insomnia/anxiety/chronic pain). 

I've become the household caretaker, taking care of my grandma and mother, and the only way I can stay sane is to drink wine every night. 

My dad died a year ago April 13th, my birthday was April 19th, I spent it taking my mom to urgent care after she had a nervous breakdown and tried to kill herself. I paid for her doctor visit and medication despite not having a ton of money (I'm down to like 100 in my bank account, living paycheck to paycheck). 

My dad was a major alcoholic, I hadn't seen him in 8 years before he died. I wish I could call him now, even though he was a sick drunk who had abused me as a child and forced me to take ""pictures"".

I know i could stop if I wanted to, but I really don't. It's the only thing that keeps me calm. But waking up every morning gagging and shitting water is getting really old. My teeth are rotting, my gums are bleeding, I still hydrate but it doesn't matter when I'm indulging in alcohol every day. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm afraid if I stop cold turkey I'll have a seizure or go through withdrawal and be a total emotional wreck. I hate that I've slipped back into this. No one knows about it. But it's there. I need to get help. I need to stop. 

I both love and loathe my father for giving me this bloodline of alcoholism and addiction, but I know it's my own choices that have lead me there, I can't blame anyone but myself.

2021-04-22 13:58:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mwamwo/off_my_chest/,Off my chest.,"I've been daily drinker now for... 4 years. Starting a month before my dad died. It started off as summer warm up (I didn't want to get sloopy drunk at party I was excited for) then my dad got sick - and I drank a couple everyday for that - then died - and I drank for that - and... That's how it was every single day (expception when I was on antibiotics and I managed to HOST a scotch tasting without drinking myself - 2 weeks) fell off the wagon right after I was done the meds. 

Anyway. I don't usually get drunk. And I still function like  a person. 

The other day - and I hadn't even had a drink - my mom and I got into a big fight over how she treats my daughter. I said some things - all were true - and now she's being like the biggest victim - she used the term elder abuse - sure mom, me pointing out how much of a hypocrite you are is abuse, keep thinking that little snow flake - 

Anyway. Since then I've been SUPER careful with what I'm saying to her - because - you know - she's a woman, and I'm a man, an in this county words like 'abuse' can land me in jail for a couple days even with zero evidence - - - but that's a r/mensrights issue. 

So for the past 3 days I HAVN'T had a drop. In the event that my mom and I get into a fight and cops are called I don't want ANYTHING coming up on my blood alcohol read. 

I'm not gonna lie. I poured myself a double shot. I brought it over to the kitchen while I was cooking (I cook for everyone - you know - cause I'm so abusive I want my family to eat  well balanced meal at least twice a day). So I cooked food - and cooked with the shot - and when I was done cooking I still had a solid 1.25oz left. I stared at it a while. Sniffed it. Rolled it around longly. Then poured it back into its bottle. 

I'm pretty sure she's got her immuno surpressed self sick because she broke lock down and visited one of her friends who don't believe corona is a thing. So now she's sick - but hiding it - in denile - coughing for hours at night like we can't fucking hear her everywhere in the house. But lord knows if i say anything she'll get mad and defensive and definatly won't go get tested... And she's still pouring herself her usual 1/2 bottle of wine - then blaming me and my wife for drinking all of it (she comes down after taking her sleeping pill and polishes off the bottle - religiously) 

So now she's probably gonna die. Even if it's just a flu or a decent cold. Her likely hood of surviving a hospital visit is less then 30% PRE covid. 

I imagine when she dies I'll jump right back into the bottle. But maybe I'll just be too sad that she finnaly did it to herself. 

Thanks for reading. I dunno if I wanted advice or just to vent. I've taken the whole lock down super serious since - mom will die if she gets covid - i havn't seen anyone other then a cashier in a year - mean while she's been in cars with her friends and in her friend's house who doesn't believe in any of this shit. 

I dunno. I'm scared for her - I'm scared OF her. Drinking won't help me. I never drank to get drunk (not... That it didn't happen once in while)",21,"{'immun': 1, 'rona': 1, 'covid': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983670115470886}"

I am a 23M and have been on and off living with my parents since I went to college and now have been living at home for the past year and a half since the pandemic started. 

I need to know if my dad (64M) is a functioning alcoholic or if I am just being overly critical. My dad is a lawyer and works rather short days typically 9-3 and the first thing he always does when he comes home is has a drink, normal right? But what throws me a bit for a loop is he will continuously have drinks through dinner all the way to bed. Since he loves making vodka grapefruits he pours his drinks pretty heavy (2 shots at least per drink) and has probably 3-4 of those a day. Sometimes he drinks 2/3 glasses of high proof whiskey and mixes in a beer or something. 

When my dad drinks he gets ""stupid"" like it's not funny he just says really stupid things and is completely out of touch with the conversation. Sometimes when I'm having a conversation at the dinner table he would get up and go watch the news or something and just ignore us. He never helps my mom around the house with anything, my mom cooks, cleans, and takes care of the dogs (I obviously try to help out as well). My dad has the same routine every single day he drinks watches the news eats dinner has a desert then goes up to bed. He doesn't have any friends and doesn't have much ties to any family because any friends or family he did once have, have basically cut him off or he cut them off for doing something quite small. 

With that being said he has never physically abused me, my mom, or my brother, but he does emotionally and verbally abuse my mother. My mom about 8-9 years was caught by my dad talking to her old boyfriend for over a span of many years. They argued for many years after and being only a high school student I was unaware as to why and I did notepad much attention to my dad's drinking. But as I've gotten older I've noticed my dad's drinking and his hair trigger temper towards my mother. I can tell sometimes when he drinks he gets mad and looks for any excuse to yell or humiliate my mom in front of me and my brother. Just this morning he said that she is the reason that he is the way he is and that she can't do anything to change it. 

I'm scared to confront my dad because the last time I confronted my dad about his drinking and the way he treats my mom he got black out drunk (the only time I've seen him black out) and was stumbling all over the place and did not understand what was going on. I have also caught him using my prescription painkillers that I got when I got surgery and I've found painkillers in his night stand too. He has told me that he doesn't know if he loves my mom and I'm scared that he drinks to mask his feelings and I fear that this is only going to get worse as he gets older and when my brother and I officially move out. 

I really don't know what to do or if I am just overeacting to my dad's drinking and my parent's relationship. My mom cries to me about the way he treats her and the drinking but I don't know what to do It gives me a lot of anxiety and he refuses to seek any type of therapy, he's very hard headed.

I used to drive black out all the time, got written up like 10 times at school, always drinking close to the most, my mental health flared up a lot while/after drinking, mom sent me to substance abuse doctors, made me see therapist once a week at school, Never had only a few (BUT NEVER TRIED TO HAVE A FEW), Told my therapist I wanted to waive the white flag when I stopped, he recommended AA first hand, my hangovers were scary, couldn't imagine my life with or without alcohol, always browned out or blacked out. 

 Some reasons in my head of why I am not an alcoholic are I have mental struggles so alcohol wasn't the problem I was jus panicking. Don't have much evidence of trying to control my drinking, never relapsed, never drank alone/ by myself. 

&#x200B;

At this point I really want to be an Alcoholic and internalize full acceptance so I can move on with the program and help others!  I just feel like I have denial over how I felt because it is hard to remember now what I felt like or just how I was using alcohol. 

My brain tells me the only way to get over my confusion with step one is to drink and re surrender. 

I don't want that because I feel like Im Fucked if I do. 

Please post some comments if interested.

We have been navigating through his alcoholism together since the end of 2019 with periods of relapses and periods of sobriety. I guess I just want to know from other people as well what the mentality is like. For example, when everything is going well e.g he got a raise and is making a lot of money, loves his job, we are doing good, etc. and he stopped at a liquor store 2 days ago and downed a big bottle of bourbon randomly - this is dangerous because previously it has sent him straight into withdrawals and a week or more long struggle with withdrawing and getting to the ER etc. What is the mentality here? Genuinely curious, is there no inside voice saying ""this is wrong"", ""you will lose your job, her or both"".. is it screaming at yourself every second to not do it but somehow you are overpowered to just keep doing it? Is it not caring? What is the thought process to relapsing? I want to understand better. Thank you to anyone that responds

I come from a family of heavy drinkers and it was a big part of my early adulthood. My high school and college years centered on drinking heavily, and my 20s in NYC have just been one long binge. 

In the last ~2 years, I’ve slowly started coming to terms with the fact that drinking just isn’t conducive to what I want to do with my life. Maybe it’s the age, but I simply cannot do the work that I want to do at the quality I want to do it at while even mildly hungover. Drinking seems to negatively impact so many parts of my life — my sleep, mental and physical health, my workouts, and of course, my work.

I think the pandemic helped me realize it because I didn’t have to drink all the time at social events (I lived in NYC for most of my 20s where alcohol is a part of everything from post-work hangouts to Sunday brunch).

Anybody else feels this way with age? I’m not saying I’ll quit drinking entirely, but I just have really begun to reassess it at this point in my life.",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982258677482605}"

I went out with some old college friends that I haven't seen in 7 years to a bar to grab some drinks. There were no fist fights or anything like that - I realized being  around them though that they perceived me to be the same person I was from when I was in college. A hardcore alcoholic frat boy. Something that I have tried so hard to runaway from (and even got into therapy for). All of the emotions suddenly came rushing back to me. I sat there at the table, everyone else talking and having a good time, having the rush of anxiety and hopeless I felt in college comeback to me.

During that time, I was at my very lowest and felt the only way to get out of it was too drink my way out. It of course didn't help. I remembered all the people I hurt in that instance and how I tried to drown my guilt with more alcohol. How I felt I didn't have a future and drowned myself in addiction. I wasted my college years doing that - and parts of my mid twenties. How my addiction almost cost me my career that took me so long to build and get to the place I am today - with what I accomplished in my field. How I haven't been able to form a human connection with someone because I was too drunk to realize that they legitimately wanted to get to know me.

I ended up leaving early.

Last Thursday, I went to my therapist appointment and cried my heart out realizing that if I was to continue to drink that I would never find true peace. Or to make amends to the people I wronged during that time. I wished I could have gone back to my younger self and be there for him and counsel him. To let him know that the bottle is not the answer and that he did have a future to look forward too.

Last Wednesday/Thursday morning was the last time I drank. I am 5 days sober now. I have attended 3 AA meetings during this time. The thing though that I am slowly realizing is that there is strength in sobriety. That letting those terrible feelings wash over me so I can process them and accept them. To find enjoyment in the small things again like going to the gym, reading a book, attending school, and being with friends without the need to drink. Sobriety is strength.

I am starting this journey with the mindset that I will be sober in my 30s and beyond (I am 29 now).

Looking for some help, my boyfriend tried to detox on his own about 6 days ago. He drank upwards of 2 pints of whiskey a day (that I know of, so I’d be naive not to think it absolutely was more than that). He’s had pancreatitis twice, once in October of last year, once when he was younger that ended up with him in a coma and on a ventilator for a few months.  Last week he had a usual heavy night of drinking then started his tapering the next day.  I don’t know for sure how much he did or didn’t drink that day-I know he did have alcohol, he said a few beers I don’t know how many or for sure any details with that. He then had a seizure around 6am. It was nearly 7-10 minutes long, it was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen. We had no alcohol in the house and scared it would happen again I got him a few beers. He refused to go to the er. The other person in the house who I got up didn’t think we needed to call 911 because he came around by the time they were there. He was out of it for a bit then back to normal. Went to work, etc etc. he’s high functioning, and I know he only could because he had alcohol in him at that point. He’s been having episodes of confusion, and memory loss for a few months now. He was diagnosed with bipolar, stress disorder, he says the episodes are disassociation from pretty devastating events he’s had over the last year etc.. I’ve noticed his balance is off, but again, alcohol does that to anyone...his vision is weird and his eye twitches constantly.  Admittedly these things do get worse when he is stressed. But I have a feeling it may be more along the lines of- something is stressful, he drinks, symptoms worsen- and it’s all from alcohol damage.  Ive been really concerned for a while now, but after the seizure he had I’m terrified. He refuses to go anywhere. I’ve tried to get an appointment just to have scans and blood work done, to see how bad things are and really in hopes he would see how bad and or the dr ordering them would convince him to go to a hospital or medical detox- every office I’ve talked to refuses to even see him and said he has to go to an er.  I’ve been pushing for just a medically monitored detox right now, obviously more long term or more serious intervention is needed in general for sustainable recovery but I figured a quick stay was my best bet with talking him into anything and he clearly needs to be medically watched so he doesn’t die coming off of it. He says he’s going to taper very slowly, he’ll get help when and if he needs it and that he can’t go anywhere became he has to finish some jobs.  I know that’s part of the disease - denial, justification, minimizing etc. I’m not mad at him, I’m just really really fucking scared this is worse than we know, and it’s not something that can wait for his work. I’ve told him I think he’s at risk for another seizure, and soon, or worse death. It doesn’t seem to matter what I say right now.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m thinking of leaving if he won’t agree to a medical detox.  I’m so scared he will over do it when I go and it’ll be bad.  I know the best way to help him is to get him somewhere safe by any means, but I also know it’s going to take a lot more than me leaving to do that.  So do I stay and keep pushing as hard as I can for him to go to a hospital or do I leave and hope it pushes him to do it? I know no one can decide for me.

Although I don't count myself as one of those people who drink alone or drink every day, I've just felt that it has gotten to be a problem for me. My friends love to drink and I love(d) to drink with them. Sharing a bottle of wine with my boyfriend over dinner isn't a trigger to me and I don't have to drink more.

But as soon as I'm at a social event where I can drink over a longer period of time,  I just can't seem to stop or know my borders. So I just drink and drink and have fun, but often (and increasingly) I end up with having a blackout. And looking back I'm ashamed of the person I become when I drink. Usually I am very empathetic and a quiet person and drinking brings out the ""fun""-side of me. But also sometimes the rude side. So when I think of my past few drinking-events I am filled with shame, that has been building up over the past years.

I've decided to gift myself a life of no-hangovers for my 30th birthday, seeing as drinking is increasingly starting to be a problem for me and it has started to affect my relationships and I've made quite some bad and wrong choices that I would have never done, had I not been drinking.

I know it might appear too spontaneous only 1 day after I got drunk, but as I said I was thinking about it even before, and I mean it 100 %.

And I know I can do it. This is not an ambition I'm hoping will come true. This is a plan I am sure I will go by. Similar thing happened with another thing that was ruining me - porn. I decided I will not watch it again and I kept to that promise for more than a year now. (I recommend it btw.)

It may be difficult from the social perspective because in the country where I live not-drinking is kind of socially unacceptable, but I don't care. Many people will try to persuade me to drink, but I will say no.

That was back in January '18 and still, I carried on. I craved it, every day, even after subsequent ceremonies in Costa Rica and here in the UK.

However, this time around I just stopped one day without any assistance. The urge just left me after drinking every day (including during the day, most days, in the last 8 years) at home and even at the office.  Maybe something inside of me just clicked that the jig was up.

I still have a small twinge now and then, since the bars reopened last week, but it dissipates very quickly and the sensation is far from a craving. In fact,  I mostly do not like the idea of having a drink.

I am also slowly getting some sh\*t together. I spent all day Sunday doing my finances. Me! I have never done that. I just buried my head in the sand, as with so many other things.

I am not sure what happened, but please God - long may it continue.

If anyone is struggling out there, I have been there and I empathise. I have done everything that you have whilst drunk, and worse...for over 30 years.

Whilst I am not complacent that I am out of the woods by any measure, please keep hopeful.

I'm glad it exists for everyone, including me.  


Second, I'm only just now realizing that my user name is...old? Potentially problematic? I've had this account and only this account for almost ten years now and I guess I can't change my user name. Maybe I should consider creating a whole new account.  


I'll keep the story and details out of this because I'm not here for pity but the short of it is that my wife went through some medical issues in the middle of 2019 which necessitated that she stop drinking entirely; the issues persisted into 2020, I realized that I could make both our lives easier by quitting, and I did that in June of 2020.  


I started feeling better, I lost at last 20 lbs in a month, and with a little melatonin at night I'm sleeping very well. Overall we're happier (she's better, btw, and still sober) and we just can't wait to go out into the real world once the pandemic is over.  


But I still get that craving. It was at its worst right after I stopped, and since then it became mild, and then it went away altogether. Sometimes I would even remember ""Wow, I would have been drunk by this point in the night, how ridiculous!"" But as the weather has gotten warmer the nice days may be what are compelling my cravings to rear up again. It's usually for a specific type of alcohol but I just joined and I don't want to romanticize it at all, so I won't talk about that.  


And the cravings do go away, and my wife is committed to being sober because, well, she literally has to for health reasons, and she's commending me for my commitment to sobriety when I don't really have to, and I finally got her to stop saying that it's alright if I slip and have a drink or go back to it again, because that's just encouraging me the other way.  


But the cravings come back on their own, regardless of what I'm watching or if I'm reading, they'll just sneak back. Time will eventually take care of those cravings, even if I have to wait until I'm asleep before they're gone, but they really are getting stronger. The alcoholic in me says that a drink or two will be fine, but I've been sober for 10 months after drinking nearly every day for 24 years, and I'm not getting any younger. I never drank my bank account away, I was never violent, at worst I was sloppy and incoherent, but that voice still nags at me that it'll be alright.  


So I guess I'm looking for any advice on cravings and what I can do about them. I'm not interested in AA and I hate talking in groups anyway, but I'm getting to the point where I'm fairly certain that I do need some outside help.",44,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9825659990310669}"

I was never the ""wake up and have a drink"" type of alcoholic but was definitely the ""drink till you drop"" type. A fifth a day of straight vodka. Sometimes on an empty stomach sometimes with friends. I'd black out basically every night and wake up regretting everything. I gained 40lbs I cut off ties with friends. I was miserable if I wasn't home alone drunk. 

My doctor knew all this. See I also have an auto immune disease so I've always been completely honest with my primary doc. ""Yes I smoke Oui'd sometimes yes I'm a binge drinker"" he, obviously as my doctor, didn't like the drinking at all. It was this time last year that I'd seen him and he finally gave me an ultimatum: Stop on my own or he would put me on meds that would MAKE me stop. I argued to him that, hey I'm only 26! You want me to stop drinking forever??? He told me that with most alcoholics they either had to stop for good or would never be able to control it

Now I'm a good girl BUT I have a small problem with authority. I KNEW I was an alcoholic but I was pissed at the thought of ""you can't control yourself you can't do moderation"" 

For a year the thought stewed in my brain, I continued to drink through the stressors of my life but I always thought about it. Then 4 months ago I realized my annual physical was coming and I wanted to Prove. Him. Wrong.

I put it simple to myself: Only drink on weekends. Friday and Saturday. That's it. I also started an OMAD diet (One meal a day) that I would do Sunday through Thursday. 

And then I did it. For about 3 months and up till now I'm still doing it. I'm drinking in moderation. Only on those 2 days. Sometimes it's a half a fifth hanging out at my house or last night it was some glasses of wine with friends because I'm going out again and I'm seeing them again. My annual physical was on Wednesday and I walked in with the smuggest look I am so sorry. I love my doctor he and I have a very good open relationship. That being said. I was an asshole. I told him how it'd been going, I'd lost 20 pounds!!! My levels were going back to normal, my depression was at a minimum my anxiety was non existent. I don't plan on stopping in fact I plan on cutting back on drinking even more until it's not even a thought in my head. I'm taking control back over it without feeling like I'm giving up or doubting myself.

When I'm with people who aren't addicts or have never experienced life with someone who is, I often hear them remark about how they dont understand how a person could do the horrible things that they see addicts do.

It starts so small. You create boundaries for yourself. You tell yourself that you will never. Here is a list of the nevers I've crossed.

I'll never be that guy.
I'll never have a problem.
I'll never use on a workday.
I'll never use during the day.
I'll never use around my kids.
I'll never use around my family.
I'll never use bill money to fund my addiction.
I'll never steal from my family and friends.
I'll never hurt anyone.
I'll never lie and cheat and steal.

I used to know him 10 years ago, and he was a regular at a bar I went to (I no longer live in that neighborhood). He wanted to meet to have a drink and catch up to which I agreed, and we hit it off pretty well and decided to go on another date. 

Well, we agreed to date exclusively and things started moving pretty fast. I am not working at the moment so I just hung out at his place all the time in the city. Things were pretty good at first. Problem is, I have a drinking problem and turns out, he's also an alcoholic. He's also a big guy and drinks a lot (literally CUPS of tequila along with alcoholic seltzers every night) and always keeps 2 handles around at his place. I can finish off a 1.75 liter of vodka in 3 days by myself and for him probably less than 2 days. So between the two of us, we were consuming a LOT of alcohol, especially since it seems that we both drink more when drinking together. 

We got into a huge fight the other night while we were both drunk. I am not even sure what started the fight, but I remember what he did. I remember him breaking up with me and telling me to pack all my shit and get the fuck out and call and Uber, to which I was a bit hesitant because it was 4am in the morning in the inner city, I was drunk, and I had a lot of stuff with me (a luggage full of clothes, a bag with all my toiletries and another bag with my Playstation and my purse) and didn't feel comfortable waiting on the side of the street for an Uber. He kept insulting me, calling me horrible names and telling me to kill myself and eventually I told him fine, I will leave because I'm not sitting here taking this verbal abuse all night. 

I packed up my belongings and during this time he told me to hurry up and if I wasn't done in 10 minutes, he was going to throw all my stuff outside and then kick me down the stairs. I just looked at him in shock that he would say something like that to me (I think at this point I had sobered up a bit)  and told him if he damaged my belongings or physically hurt me in any way, I'd call the cops or damage his car that was parked outside. He then threatened to kill me, so I quickly grabbed my bags so I could go outside, to which he suddenly decided he didn't want me to leave and cornered me in the kitchen and blocked my way. I was scared since he is a very large man and he was obviously very angry and very drunk. 

I backed down and just told him I was sorry and I was crying just so he wouldn't hurt me and he asked me to spend the night and we'd ""talk about it the next day"" to which I just agreed as to not anger him any more. He made me stay in the room with him and I eventually fell asleep. Next day, he was getting ready to go to work and was trying to talk to me, to which I gave him the cold shoulder. He asked me whats wrong and I asked him if he remembered what happened last night, and he said he had no idea and thought it was odd I was being ""a bitch"" to him. I told him what he had said to me and done to me and he looked shocked and just told me he was sorry. I told him sorry isn't going to cut it since it wasn't just a dumb fight, he had threatened to hurt and kill me and intimidated me to staying when I wanted to leave. I eventually just left. 

During the day, we were texting each other and he was asking for forgiveness and that he was very sorry, but I just told him I needed time and space because what he said to me was fucked up. We aren't that far along into our relationship and I wasn't going to take that shit from anyone. I told him I can't date another alcoholic because we're just enabling each other and I don't want to have drunken fights like that, especially if he says such horrible things to me and doesn't even remember. He begged me to give him another chance, and I just told him I don't hate you, but maybe we can talk again when we both fix our drinking problems. I don't intend to date him ever again, I just didn't want to end things on a bad note seeing as we would have still been ""friends"" if we never tried dating. 

But throughout all this, it made me realize something. It was something I had always known but now it's become even clearer. I've also ruined a lot of relationships because of drinking and people would call me toxic and ask me if I remembered what I said or did the night before. I was usually just like ""whatever, I'm sure you did something to piss me off"" but now I see it. He was that person and I was that person. If he hadn't threatened to hurt me, I might have given him another chance. But I don't know what he's capable of and I don't even know what I am capable of... when drunk. 

Alcohol is literal poison for the body and mind and everything in life. I'm sad and disgusted by the both of us and I told him that I knew the drinking thing would eventually be the reason we wouldn't work. He agreed and said he would quit drinking. I hope he does but I doubt it. I also hope that this is a reminder to myself and everyone else... if it's ruining your life, then STOP. It's not worth it.

For years now I have had two vices in this world, drinking and cardio. One was never enough to cancel out the other, and I always knew that if I lost one, the other would go into overdrive. During the 2010s, my drinking was not so bad, but I used energy drinks at work to compensate for the more stressful times. It was not so much about whether I was going up or down, just wanted to feel something different.

In 2020 I resolved to cut back on energy drinks because the stress from work was not as hard on me as it used to be. My alcoholism, however, which is usually dialed back after football season, did not slow at all during 2020. So this year I knew I had to seriously cut back on that like I did caffeine last year. My compromise to myself was to only drink socially.

I am in a running club that meets once a week. We run a few miles then afterwards have a few beers and some food afterwards (when and where appropriate during COVID). I’ve also hosted a couple of movie nights with small groups of close friends. That has been the majority of my drinking this year, and other than those movie nights, I have not brought alcohol into this house.

I have used non-alcoholic beers and whiskey alternatives to curve my cravings, but so far I am going strong. But like I said earlier, my cardio is going into over drive. 30 to 60 minutes of running has not been enough to keep my brain from overthinking about how much I hate where I am at in life right now. I have gotten more into bike riding lately because I can ride for two to three hours at a time, plus whatever recovery I go through, and that gives me something to focus on other than my life.

As far as what has me so unhappy, I’m enlisted in the military. I have been now for almost 11 years. I grew up on the west coast but have been stationed on the east coast for the entire enlistment, so there was never a real support group around me. I loved the first six-year contract so I reenlisted for six more, but as I made rank the responsibilities changed and I grew to love the job less and less.

I’m already over the hump towards the pension, and the pandemic had me skeptical of leaving a good job without something new lined up, so I reenlisted again, committing to my 15 year mark. I would like to tough this out until I get to that pension and that would give me some cushion to start a new career from the bottom.

So... I’ve made friends out here but I’m still miss being around my family which has already grown and changed a lot in these past 11 years. I hate the responsibilities and even the culture of the job, but I’m under contract and want to stay sane long enough to earn my pension before starting over. I know my drinking was to silence my brain, and now I’m throwing myself into cardio to force my mind to focus on other things instead of what it may want to think about. I’m not really sure where to go from here. I’ve eliminated some problems but don’t think I’ve found real solutions.

I knew it was not possible by myself, but I was comfortable drinking. So I kept drinking. I was very comfortable identifying as an alcoholic since the beginning. It gave me a pass to drink all I want and not plan ahead. I never really thought I would live past 25, either the alcohol would kill me or I would. I've dealt with depression and anxiety all my life. I was a secluded, isolated, secret alcoholic. My friends and family loved my fun and normal drinking around them. I never drove drunk, never got into an argument or fight, never lost a job or home, never had blackouts or hangovers. And was a pleasant fun drunk. But for 12 years I couldn't stop drinking. 

I'd drink morning, day and night.  Alcohol was not fun anymore, it was a necessity. Towards the end of my last bender, drinking 2 pints of vodka a day and a few beers at night, I was ready to either end my life or my drinking. Both options were a possibility, but ending my life seemed like the easier choice. I couldn't go 4 hours without a drink.

I was scared that if I sober up, I would kill myself, and if I got even more drunk I would do it either way. I knew something was going to give. I had hit my rock bottom. I made some last minute preparations for whatever the outcome would be. And had a moment of clarity after breaking down to my husband. I was ashamed of the secret drinking and lies. I'm only as sick as my secrets, and shame thrives in secrecy. 

I found a fellowship around my neighborhood. I have gone to a meeting every day since I've stopped drinking. As an atheist, AA is a very intimidating prospect. While I do not worship a god, I'm very spiritual with the energy that's alive in the world. I'm keeping my mind open and the spiritual connection I've found in the fellowship is beyond what I can describe. And I'm very excited to learn from it and heal with it. My higher power is not fully defined yet but it's definitely alive in the fellowship. The energy left behind by my mom (who never touched an alcoholic drink), my best friend (who was an alcoholic) and my mother in law (who was sober for 45 years), is what I'm developing into my higher power. They all passed away recently and all loved me very much and each of them had a relationship with alcohol. Their energy will always be part of this world and I'm learning to let go and let them guide me.

2 days ago I got a sponsor and 3 weeks ago I started seeing a therapist. 

I'm glad to make it to 30 days, but I know that I'm just starting my journey into sobriety, and if I'm fortunate enough, this will be my continuous journey for the rest of my life. One day at a time.

So, FIL raised my husband and his brother practically on his own because ex-wife was an alcoholic. They divorced when my husband was still an early teen, so his dad took over his two sons.

He confessed that's he's been doing this for more or less a year and that he wants to seek help. So my husband started to look for contacts, he commented the situation with his brother and they both started getting advices from a mental health professional to know how to deal. 

Long story short, FIL has relapse multiple times, he's gone off the grid for days, he constantly says he is not drinking and then he just shut down. He had an appointment with a psychiatrist and he showed up completely drunk, he had an AA meeting and he showed up shit canned and with alcohol and had a fight with a nurse. He's told my husband to leave him die alone, that he whishes to drink himself to dead and more terrible things.

Needless to say, my husband is a mess, he can barely concentrate at work, he's not eating well, he cannot sleep, he constantly receives calls from his dad's friends telling him how worry they are, how he is not even answering the door, how they have found him pass out several times. This is affecting my husband deeply and we just want to help. 

Right now we decided that he'll go to his dad's for some time while I stay in the city (I have prenatal appointments). His dad basically is not talking to him and he's just been 2 days in his bedroom, going out for toilet trips and some snacks... Not sure if he's drinking in there. He says he won't come out until my husband leaves his house. 

Now, I know that you should let them touch bottom and they need to seek help on their own. But beyond alcoholism, he's dealing with a depression (not diagnose yet, but I believe the signs are clear). We won't leave him alone, you just don't leave a sick person alone.

What should we do? As a family, as a couple? Should we move to the country side and be closer? Should we call the ambulance? Should my husband throw away all the alcohol in his house? Should we call a professional to go to his house?

I'm just so heartbroken.

I started at 21 but I took a whole year off last and probably started drinking again in December but very casually like 4 coors a night then maybe get a little more drunk on Friday and occasionally drink Saturday Sunday nights. So I go to the hospital they give me antavin, fluids and IV and lay me down. Take blood tests and a ultra sound on my liver seems like I just drank too much and the blood work is fine. So he sent me home with Benadryl and told me drink water but I actually felt a little better so I decided to play some Xbox now I’m trying to sleep again I can’t. Is it maybe the Xbox, I feel like my wirhdrawl shouldn’t be as severe as some others or am I psyching myself out? Any help appreciated. Shits scary can’t wait to be my self again.

2021-04-16 00:26:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mrvro8/where_do_i_start/,Where do I start?,"I talk to a few of my close friends about getting sober, and they tell me I don't have a problem. ""It's not that big a deal, or you aren't that bad"". The reality is that I've been drinking to the point of puking or blacking out, consistently for... 12 years?! I've always been the girl too drunk at a party, acting sloppy, falling all over the place, or just generally incoherent and go silent, I'm told.  Do a lot of things I probably wouldn't if I were sober.  I'm the fun party girl everyone wants to be around when I've had a few drinks. I'm loud and funny, sometimes translated as obnoxious and rude. I don't mean to sound conceited but half the time I think ppl are nicer to me about my drinking because I'm pretty! its annoying af. I consider myself a social drinker, and I think that's why my friends tell me I don't have a problem. Because Its not like I'm sitting home alone, getting drunk every night. I'm just the girl that gets too drunk on the weekends. It started as ""FOMO"", never wanting to miss a fun drinking event to hang out with friends. Then as I went to college and left my comfortable friend group, I drank more to ease my nerves and anxiety about hanging out with new people. When my mom died 5 years ago, I drank to numb my emotions and depression, and actually turned into a mean drunk whereas I used to just be the hot mess acting a fool.

My drinking problem has gone from drinking to fit in, to drinking too often, blacking out multiple times a week - being late for work, drinking and driving, to now being that I don't drink often.. maybe once or twice a week. But when I do drink, I don't know how to control the amount. If I'm drinking that night, I'm likely blacking out that night. Because once I've had a few, I just keep going and going. I don't know when to cut myself off. I'm having too much fun, want to keep drinking and never want to go home. I've realized a portion of it is because I'm actually really lonely. I live alone, I don't date. I have plenty of friends and good ones at that, but I crave intimacy and I still think loneliness is a big factor in my drinking lately. I drink to stay out with friends, ""stress free"" or to find some guy to take home to share an hour of ""fake intimacy"" with.

My reality now is that I feel my entire life revolves around drinking. I've been saying to myself for years, I should really drink less, I wish I could quit drinking, .. or I'm going to give myself a two drink limit (...LOL). To cut back and hopefully not black out anymore. Then there's either an event (friends birthday, wedding, holiday, etc.) that I always end up making an excuse for. I'm almost 30 years old and I am SO sick of my own shit. I've been the ""black out girl"" for far too long, I don't want to be known as the person I've been the last decade and continue to be. My friends don't NOT support me, but they tell me I've improved so much since I was 21, or Oh you didn't miss much, you only lost the last hour of the night. Whatever it is. Or oh I didn't notice you were that drunk. But I find myself with only friends that drink nearly every time we hangout. I WORK in a bar, and while we cannot drink on the clock anymore, I've been taking full advantage of our ""shift drink"" post shift - slamming 5-6 shots in the last hour of the night.

This long rambling post to really just ask for help. Where do I start when my entire life seems to revolve around drinking, all my friends drink, etc. Why is alcohol so WIDELY accepted as the norm, as a LEGAL substance that causes just as much damage to lives as other illegal substances. How do I stop making excuses and stick to not drinking for more than 5 days? I'm so sick of my own shit, I'm sick of blacking out and not knowing what happens at the end of a night of drinking. I'm sick of hearing that I INSISTED on driving home drunk so that I could make it to work in the morning. I'm sick of not knowing how to talk to guys/hook up/date without being under the influence of something. I'm sick of ALL the MONEY I waste on drinking ($300+ a month if not more). I'm so sick of it controlling my life.

She now drives to get 8% alcohol, drink where ever, and then drive back. She is drinking and driving now. (I put the percent in there because I still have trouble with the percents, what it means, and when it is bad to drive.)

 I first came to know of this new habit when she excused herself to go to the gas station to get gas. Obviously, that's odd. Who leaves their house to put gas in their car, especially if you live a ways from town? Anyway, she came back and when she got out of her car, she was not balanced on her feet. She even had to use the door to catch herself. I watched and I thought to myself that she needed to be sober before I talk to her, so I let it go for the day. Two days later and I decide to talk with her regardless because I thought ""every second she spends on the rode is another second she could wreck."" So I go and talk to her. I talked with her while she was already drunk...bad timing, I know. I just felt I was letting it go on for too long. She was vauge and responded off. Expected. However one thing that concerned me was when I mentioned that drinking and driving puts herself and others at risk, she responded with ""exactly."" I know that there is know way of telling what she meant. She was drunk after all; but it still caught me off guard a bit.

She hasn't drove with others in the car **yet.**  Thats is how it usually is, right? You say you won't do something and then as the alcohol intake gets worse you end up doing it. My mom once said she was never going to drink and drive, yet here she is doing it.

I’m not sure even why I drink. I feel like I’m always chasing this like quality alone time where I feel good and watch my favorite shows and “relax”.

2021-04-09 12:40:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mnl9cz/i_keep_noticing_new_things_about_my_alcoholic/,I keep noticing new things about my (alcoholic) husband's social circle,"Preface: both I and my husband are alcoholics. Over the past 3.5 years, I've gotten help from my doctors and mostly recovered. He has gotten worse, keeps entering the same cycles over and over, and actively pulls away from help. Lying, deceptions, full 9, he just won't stop.

I've been critical of my husband's social circle in the past, both directly and indirectly. I became publically vocal about how poorly they function when their behavior came to hurt me directly, and therefore I pulled away from participating in whatever nonsense they did. Because my husband is very dependant on me (more than I realized), he began to pull away from them, too. However, it didn't stop him from being friends with them, especially online. Predictably, he's participated in lots of online stuff with them since Covid started. I don't have a problem with any of this, though I may not understand it and I really wish he would branch out.

As he's gotten worse with liquor, I've become more concerned his friends are ignoring and enabling more than I realized. Then, I saw a pattern within the social circle itself, waaaay before I met them. They have a history of attracting friends who are/become addicts, witnessing and ignoring their decline, judging their decline, then ultimately rejecting and ejecting them from the social group. It happened while we were planning our wedding. Someone they were actively rejecting was supposed to be invited to our wedding, so I sent them our invite address survey, then I had to retract it because my husband said, ""Oh, he's not really our friend anymore."" Embarassing.

I confronted some of his friends (online) not long ago, and their ""ringleader"" (for lack of a better word) accused me of being the cause of my husband's addiction, said I should be fixing the problem myself, and blamed me for sequestering my husband from them. He followed this up with a PM to my husband apologizing (but not for anything specific) while also saying that his marriage to me might be the cause of some of his problems, all of which predate me. There was also a comment that warned against me not being able to understand THEIR relationship. It said virtually nothing about my husband's addiction issue.

I was beffudled. It read like an abusive boyfriend.

[[for context, the confrontation happened because they were video chatting as a group, and my husband was getting shitfaced in front of them, which happens on a regular basis nowadays, constantly leaving the computer to visit his ""hiding spot,"" and he got worse than usual. I stopped him, stepped in and spoke to them, basically saying, ""aren't you guys seeing this?? can you help me?""]]

I don't think my husband drinks because of his friends. I honestly don't. He has a really, really fucked up family history, and his father was an A plus shit show and his mother has zero backbone I'm unsure how she stands. But this is.... fucked. fucked fucked.

I'm not really looking for reactions as much as I'm asking.... has anyone else seen anything this extreme? It's taken me several months to even understand how messed up this guy's reaction was. And it's sort of understood he ""runs"" their social interactions. I was telling them how extreme their friend's alcoholism was, and his reaction was to blame me, call me names, and tell his friend to leave me. 

And, more broadly, I think my husband relates to a lot of men like this. I'm not sure how to process a lot of this, because I'm not sure what it means for what type of help he really needs.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973726272583008}"

I didn't know this, and it's concerning to me. After he told me this I feel different. What advice can be given here?","I've been dating him exclusively since September 2020, but met him in the summer of 2020. We do get drinks a lot, and the only time I ever drink is if I go out with him. I only assumed he was doing the same. I didn't assume he was drinking a half pint or more every day. I know he loves beer. I love beer, and I love trying new beers. I don't drink every day. Max. I will have a few drinks 2-3x a week, which this is even concerning that I do it that often. 2x a week is concerning to me, and then I find out that he drinks a half pint every day. On top of the half pint he drinks a lot of beer too. 

It just makes me sad. I don't want to get into a very serious relationship and possibly marry a person who has a serious alcohol problem later on. I don't want that at all. I also do not want to start drinking more either, and I think I might if I am with him every day. If he has been drinking a half pint every day after work, I cannot tell. If we go a little wild on a Friday he always buys a half pint or a pint or something and he and his brother share it. I thought this was just a fun activity and not a daily activity though. Honestly I think I am not going to drink around him anymore. Is this mean? I did tell him this was concerning to me, and his brother laughed and said ""Red flag, [bf name]. I told you to stop drinking so much, you drink too much!"" And my boyfriend looked at me and laughed like he was uncomfortable and said ""I have my demons, I do. Is it a red flag?"" And I said ""I don't know if its a red flag, but it's concerning to me that you drink every day. Yikes."" That was the whole conversation. 

Would it be mean if I completely just stopped drinking with him? It puts me off honestly. I am not sure how I didn't notice this though, I definitely have been drinking more since I met him. Before I would drink maybe 2x a month. He never seems drunk though. I've seen him actually drunk once, and he said he was embarrassed about it. I would be more embarrassed about every day drinking than a one-time drunkenness at a party we attended. I'm not sure what you're supposed to do in situations like this. I thought I had found someone who I might be with for a long time, but I don't know if I will tolerate daily drinking if we move in together at some point. I'm not sure how to approach this.

I used to not drink for four and a half years. I started again 6 years ago. And trying to quit for 3-4 years. The time passed very quickly. Because I was mostly drunk. And I don't remember very much. I tried AA and it helped me for one month. Now I don't feel it anymore. God, angelsz ghosts and shite. Come on. I just don't know how to live without booze. How do I congratulate myself on doing something great and how do I comfort myself when shit hits the fan? What's comparably good as alcohol? Drugs? Watching tv series? Listening to music? It only works if you're 12. Why would someone live without booze? That's crazy to think about it. That was a great invention of humanity, a medicine for our ugly life?

I mean I've lost a lot because of alcohol. Mostly money and friends. But the problem is I can't stop. Mostly just hiding myself drinking. Drinking while walking so my family doesn't know. Drinking a lot. And just smuggling one bottle of hard alcohol in my bag. To finish myself and wake up 12 hours later. I am only binge drinking like three days a week and curing myself low dose alcohol other days. But it took time to get to this level. But now I can't go any further. Because I know I've done this once and it wasn't better without drinking. My lower back started to hurt like 6 months ago and it's getting worse. Chances are it's kidneys stones? No idea. But i feel so sick even without it. Can life be no suffering every moment of your life?

I only say this to myself: life is just suffering, but it's even more suffering when drinking too much. Sometimes it helps sometimes not, because I don't know how to live. Why bother living? I don't want to kill myself but then I don't know why not too. Waiting for magic pills. And I don't want to disappoint my parents.

Recently I've been trying NAC. It's a supplement, it makes my  belly upset while eating on empty stomach. And not helping at all anyway. I've also bought some benzodiazepines second hand but this is my plan Z. I want to try something else first. I know I could eat it and drink again and probably hurt myself.

Oh and anyway I used to have panic attacks in social interactions like going to the shop standing in the queue. I've overcame it just by reading a few books about my problem. But not 100%. I'm still avoiding socializing. I made a M.A abroad. I didn't dream of it before. But now it doesn't make sense at all. I've bothered for my parents mostly. I'm 29 now. I won't quit quiting. But hell how do you do it without AA? I'm an atheist. I like hearing other people's stories. It helps. I want to be strong. And also enjoy life. But I can't even dream. I just want to make enough money to live far away from other people. This is the only reason I can think of. But I wish there was more. 

I kind of miss those days when I couldn't wait to go back home and play my PSX. Those games were so shitty and I could play for days without blinking an eye. When i grew up there was no longer such thing. No reason to go back home just a must. Nothing to wish for. Just managing with an effort to go through and waiting for that magic pill.

So, I quit drinking around 10 months ago. In January I heard about phenibut. I tried it and it was GREAT, like some adderall and the social lubrication of drinking.

Well, I quickly escalated my dose and was taking 5-7 grams within a week.

Fast forward two months and I’ve been through 3 1/2 125 gram bottles. I’m cutting back hard now and am back to withdrawal, something I thought I was done with. I’m not worried, because I’ve identified the problem and am hellbent on cutting back to zero. I’ve gone from an average of 5.5 grams to around 3.5 grams in a week.

I feel like utter shit regardless and my kidneys have been hurting. This time it was phenibut, but realistically it will be any substance I ever try.

Over the past year, it has taken over his life. He is a miner and has been physically unable to work due to his poor health from drinking. He’s now lost his job and as long as he’s drinking, he has no drive or ambition to do anything. He has attempted to get sober a few different times over the past 6 months (mostly due to me pushing him to). He has had 3 seizures from alcohol withdrawals. The first was after only a few hours of sobriety and he was working underground when it happened. The second was after less than 24 hours without alcohol and was in our shower where he nearly hit our tile bench when he went down. I panicked and was very upset which led to our pitbull attacking my leg and my husband and I both ended up in the hospital. He was put on medication from the hospital to detox at home and stayed sober for almost a month. Due to broken ribs and injuries sustained from the seizure he couldn’t work for months and as of March 24th, was fired from his job. Almost 2 weeks ago, he tried getting sober again. After 24 hours, he had another (much less severe) seizure. He stayed sober for about a week before starting to drink again. I have tried to convince him to check into a rehab facility, go to AA, or even just reach out to sober friends but he’s not willing to do anything. We have a 2 year old at home and I work full time. He drinks so heavily while I’m at work and our daughter is at daycare that he wets himself on our couch and in bed and doesn’t even care enough to clean it.

I have also felt very alone in my struggles, and I have been reluctant to share for a while. 

About 4 years ago, I got divorced and left with a bunch of ptsd and mental issues after dealing with a psychopathic narcissist. For those of you who know, I don’t have to get into detail on the mental/emotional gaslighting and taunting, Stockholm syndrome, which eventually led to physical abuse, and also sexual abuse. I was 28 when I started drinking, due to not being able to cope with everything that happened. I tried talk therapy over the years and I am still dealing with these subconscious feelings of inadequacy, anxiety and being stuck in fight or flight mode most of the time. Basically I never feel safe, even in my own home with doors locked. I couldn’t even have any kind of relations, sexual and otherwise with a man for well over a year after my divorce. I am now considering some kind of hypnotherapy, I don’t know, something that will help with the subconscious fears rather than just the conscious ones. I’m fine until some violent event triggers me, like war flashbacks. 

I started with just a 6 pack on weekends, then grew to every other to every night, then I would get a 12 case, and basically drink til I passed out. I was working for a while and functioning so I never thought anything of my habit. Fast forward to last year, during the first part of the pandemic, and I was drinking every day, with maybe one day or two here or there in between. For me, that’s not a good thing, but no one noticed because I remained functional for the most part, or so it appeared to everyone else. Inside it felt like I was screaming for help, but too afraid to admit it, and would drown out the voice with more booze. I would sit in my apartment alone and cry, lashed out at people who cared about me or tried, mostly hate myself, and my mom lived 10 mins away and couldn’t be bothered to ever come visit or have me over. I called her one time needing help, but she basically hung up on me because she had work to do. I was boarderline suicidal at the time. 

After that, November of last year, I was going downhill fast, and I was drinking lots of wine at the time, which is stronger, so I would black out, be missing time, and I just didn’t care because every day was the same stupid shit. Locked up at home, no job no places to go etc. Then I decided one day I had enough, and I moved out of my place and to a new city so I could start over. 

I am now in my new city with a new job and new life, and ironically I’m working in a liquor store now, because it’s the only job I could find right now, so challenge accepted! I don’t drink every day anymore, and have cut that back over the last few months. I stick to mostly weekend and see how many days of the week I can get through before the weekend, sometimes I crack one open by Wednesday or Thursday, but I just get a few tall cans instead of a whole case or 6pack. I’m still working on cutting back more too, just not putting too much pressure or it has the opposite affect for me. As I heal, it makes me need to drink less over time. 

I’m doing my best to find my reasons. I want a family, it never happened in my 20’s and part of hurting myself with drinking was feeling hopeless about ever finding someone who truly loves me that I can share a happy family with. I value family because I grew up in a dysfunctional one, so I want to do it right. I also have lots of things and hobbies I want to pursue, I paint and play guitar and I’d love to improve my skills in both. and you can’t do a lot when you’re drunk or hung over all the time. I will have to say that some of my best song ideas came to me when I would be buzzed, but not blackout drunk, so there’s a time and place for everything in moderation. 

I am lucky right now because I do have a partner who has been part of the reason I have been able to cut back my drinking. He says he sees who I am beyond what I’m doing right now, and is reminding me of who I really am, and who I was before alcohol took over, and I am so greatful. We spend lots of time in nature and by the ocean where we live, which helps a lot. He’s kinda made me challenge myself to make a goal to drink for the right reasons, like if we go camping on the weekend and want to have drinks by the fire, and not just in the middle of the week for no reason, or because I’m bored or depressed. I’m trying to just smoke weed throughout the week and stick with that. I’ve smoked weed since I was 20 with no impact on my life or my desire to live life, and after only a few years of drinking, I’ve been reduced to a depressing lump who doesn’t want to keep going sometimes.  

I was considering AA or some kind of support group, although it might be tricky with covid now, but I just had to reach out even in an online community because I also need support. It’s a scary thing to face yourself sometimes, but I haven’t given up yet. My hesitation for seeking more help is I have been to an addiction clinic Previously, 3 years ago, and I didn’t qualify, basically they said I wasn’t a severe case and wasn’t on meth or crack, so I was fine. I knew I wasn’t, and I was just acting as a functional alcoholic, so I knew I had to just take my own responsibility and not expect anyone else to be able to identify it for me, and if things got worse it’s my fault. Or it’s my subconscious feeling that I don’t deserve help because of the failed parenting strategies I was exposed to as a child. 

To everyone else out there going through their own battles, you can do it. I really feel for everyone here and out on the world going through addiction. I’ve learned that it’s only a symptom of an underlying problem you have with yourself, and it takes courage to face whatever that may be, but believe in yourself, and be nice to yourself!

Never abusive, but he lied, gaslight, lost jobs. It was negatively affecting our lives. A little over 3 years ago, I hit my breaking point. I took our 2 month son and left. We were gone for 2 weeks. He sobered up. We went home. I told him that if I left again, I wouldn't come back. 


He's been sober ever since. Hasn't touched a drop.


At first, I was afraid to have alcohol in the house at all. He kept trying to convince me that he could handle it. One evening, he brought me home a bottle of wine. Wine was never his thing. He didn't touch it. I didn't finish it all in one night, but he never touched a drop. 


I kept it at wine for 2 and a half years. I'm not a heavy drinker. I would have a glass 2 or 3 nights a week. 


Well, a couple months ago, he brought me some premixed margaritas. I had some occasionally and the bottle was in the fridge for 2 weeks. A while after that, he brought me some bailey's and butter schnapps and would make me some shots with it. Again, I went slow with it. Both bottles are still in the fridge. 


Yesterday, he bought me a bottle of birthday cake vodka and pineapple juice to make me pineapple upside-down cake shots. 


He hasn't had even a sip of any of the alcohol. He says he no longer has the desire to drink. 


I know he hasn't had anything to drink. He used to thing he could hide it from me, but he couldn't. After just one drink, subtle changes in his mannerisms, voice, whatever would tip me off. I always knew. 


He seems to take pride in his ability to mix drinks. It makes him happy if I praise the drink. He is actually excellent at it. 


I'm not sure what to think. Is he living vicariously through me? Is he still trying to prove that he can handle being around alcohol? Is he just proud of his skill and likes to see me enjoying what he's made?


I truly believe that he doesn't want to drink. And he's gone to bars/parties with friends - without me, because we have kids and didn't have a sitter - a handful of times and come home completely sober.

I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for 2 years who I love dearly.

The problem: Essentially, I can go one or two nights without alcohol no problem but inevitably I find an excuse to have a drink and when I do it's difficult for me to not go from 1 drink to MANY, and by many I mean enough to induce memory loss.

My friends all love a drink (and I do have a diverse group of friends who love me and I love them) but when a dinner party or a night out is happening I feel like I'm missing out if I don't go, and if I do go it would be strange and hard to explain if I didn't drink.  


I'm often in the habit of having a couple drinks with friends, and when they all decide to go home, I go to my place and drink alone until I am completely smashed.  


I never feel like I'm at the vodka in my cereal type of level but every time I touch alchohol  I have this strong urge to get absolutely black out drunk.  


I more or less function and perform my job daily (somewhat poorly especially when I'm hungover) but I feel like I'm keeping secrets from the people I love about the extent of my drinking.  


Cold turkey would be such a big step, I'd have to tell my alchohol loving friends and family the extent of my problems and I feel like I'd struggle to be apart of the same social circles and social activities they currently do. They are lovely people and wouldn't judge but it would just be a completely different vibe.

I’m engaged to an alcoholic as of last Monday. He’s been one for about ten years now. The longest he’s gone without drinking (as far as I know) is a year, and that was in a transitional home. Since he’s been with me (9/27 of last year), I think he’s gone three weeks without a drink. I’ve watched him go through a few pretty bad withdrawals (but luckily no DTs).

I’ve done everything I can think of to support him through those. I held him when he couldn’t stop shaking, emptied the bucket that he threw up in because he couldn’t make it to the bathroom, and I’ve loved him as fiercely as I know how to and yes, I’ve bought him alcohol and made solo trips to get it because he was unable to get off the couch or close to getting sick, as he calls it. 

I’m worried that I’m enabling him. Instead of giving him tough love when he’s debating getting another drink and me saying, “No, you shouldn’t do that,” I “save” him (again as he calls it) by getting him alcohol. I hate watching him suffer but he suffers every time he takes a drink so am I really saving him or just making it worse? The voice in the back of my head whispers the second.

I’m at a loss. I’m going to marry this man because I’ve never loved anyone the way I love him. He brings me such joy (not only when he’s sober) and returns the love I give him with so much fervor. (Hello there, worry of co-dependence on my part) On the other hand, I wish, wish, wish he would try AA and church with me by his side to support him. He’s admitted to being afraid of AA because it hurts to share his pain and experience other people’s. I know I can’t change him. I don’t want him to change or to try and change him myself. I love him for who he is, not who I think he could be or should be, but for him, good parts and bad. I’ve told him this. 

But what the heck do I do? Do I deny him alcohol (he would just walk to the store) or do I keep him safe by driving him or getting it myself? (We live on a very busy road full of stupid drivers.) When he’s fighting himself against the urge to drink and looks at me with such tortured eyes and asks what he should do, what is there to say? It’s either cave and bring him a drink or risk the chance of anger (he is NOT violent. I’m terrified of confrontation). 

Please be gentle. He’s the love of my life and I feel weak for not wanting him to suffer. Any input is greatly welcomed.

2021-04-06 16:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mlkpnk/what_aa_doesnt_quite_get_addiction_often_centers/,"What AA doesn't quite get: addiction often centers around very treatable trauma. Trauma you didn't want, ask for, or deserve. Instead, the resulting symptom, alcoholism, is labeled a (cosmic?) character flaw and the sufferer made to blame. This is the best we can do?","Sorry for the title but it has to be said. We HAVE a great deal of science on trauma and addiction, two concepts very difficult to decouple. The treatment industry rakes in thousands xeroxing a 1940's tome and doing chants. We are **failing** addicts.

\---

Dr. Gabor Mate is a Hungarian-Canadian doctor, 77 years old, who's spent his entire career working with both addiction and trauma. I watched this YouTube video of a podcast interview (it's LONG but WORTH IT) where he describes what he believes addiction is. His insight was remarkable; like he was speaking directly to or about me.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9B5mYfBPlY&ab\_channel=TimFerriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9B5mYfBPlY&ab_channel=TimFerriss)

His theory is that addiction at least can be (trying to stay personal) the result of trauma trapped in the **body**. A frozen reaction that was never resolved in your nervous system.

I'm not that spiritual... logic, science oriented atheist, but this was absolutely my case. Alcoholic, absent father. Poverty. Emotionally negligent stepdad. Poor socializing.

Frozen trauma made me unable to feel and connect. I lived in my own head, verbalizing everything, and TV/video games provided a safe world of exploration.

You know what the workaround for real life socializing was? Booze!

The ultimate anti-anxiety drug alcohol (take enough and you'll never be anxious again) allowed me to connect on an emotional level with friends, my surroundings, and even my own life story. I was me again for a little while. Never wanted to stop because who wants to stop feeling loved and connected? Stopping equated to spiritual re-death. Disconnection.

When babies are hurt by their caregivers, they can be sent into an ego death. Learn to not be anyone or anything except what's necessary to survive. A shell with a painted face, painted in just the right way to avoid abandonment. That was me. Eating addiction, game addiction, binge drinking... the only solace I could get was from dopamine stimulating activities. It's been shown trauma can reduce oxytocin levels, the bonding chemical. (Alcohol can stimulate it, too...)

In other words, I became addicted to processes and achievement (and drink), to fill the void where serotonin goes. I made money and couldn't relax. Worked and didn't (really) play without chemicals. But this was ""normal"" to me. *So what was I doing wrong?*

Anyway, literally EVERY episode of Intervention and My 600LB Life has a traumatic backstory. Yet modern treatment methods focus on ""alcohol is a poison""... great, if you care about that sort of thing. I did not have a ""self"" to care about. Annie Grace didn't quite get me there. And it was frustrating. Sorry for the rant.

All of the above I figured out over six years. Crazy to think about.

**Trapped in the body? \[The following is just personal theory and musing I've done during hangovers. Love other perspectives though.\]**

It's a theory that's worked for me. Trauma isn't just about war; abuse, neglect, inconsistency, poverty, anything abrasive and frightening to a child really. My psych (did her fellowship on PTSD and diagnosed me) said that trauma victims often disconnect and isolate because the brain of a traumatized person can feel flat-out alien. People just get up and play tennis? Why? I'm exaggerating, but not a lot...

In *The Body Keeps the Score* the theory is that **animals store trauma to process and learn from in times of safety** but the human rational mind uniquely interrupts this process.

This might explain **reenactment**. The momentum even over generations to repeat trauma. It could be a conduit for generational addiction if never resolved. I definitely did this without realizing. My mom's bros/sisters are all food or booze addicts and their parents died very young, sent to orphanages. had it coming from a lot of directions.

The **vagus nerve** activates our parasympathetic (rest, relax) systems and easy exercises help stimulate it. EMDR (eye movement therapy) works from this principle. Of all the things I've tried and spent money on, meditation and eye movements in the right setting have worked wonders. Lots out on YouTube! Learning to put myself in rest mode at will has been awesome.

But last night I had a sequence of broken up dreams (from me waking up constantly) that were very vivid, but had a strange aspect to them I haven't experienced before.


In each of these 3 dreams I was definitely suffering from alcohol impairment, or bad withdrawal symptoms, that stopped me from interacting with the dreams as much as I would have liked.


At the end of the first dream I was trying to turn on a light at the edge of my stairs and was losing my balance. I started falling then woke up screaming with my arm out trying to grab onto something.

The second was about a new family staying with my family for a while. They were all super nice and positive, and I felt guilty the whole time because of how negative things have been around my addictions, so I stayed away from them for the most part.

The last dream I guess I enrolled in some kind of super hero school, where I took classes and practiced fighting and such. But the whole time I was very impaired, I couldn't look all the way up, like there was something pushing my body down when I did. I also couldn't grab anything because my hands were shaky and too uncoordinated. So I just kind of coasted through this exciting world instead of interacting with it fully. 


In all three dreams, elements of my alcoholism interfered with something I was trying to do. I think a lot of it stemmed from the guilt and anxiety I feel about it. Mix in fever withdrawal symptoms and, [well](https://i.imgur.com/dWumQ6Q.png).

Getting drunk and pissing on myself makes me feel worthless as a human being but whenever the option to drink is there, I take it.

I just wanted to ask a few questions to the community as i struggle with considering staying in my ex's life based on his substance abuse issues. He is 39, and when i met him four years ago - he did admit to me that he drank alone often but it never bothered me as he had a really demanding job, got off of work extremely late and wouldn't be able to go out anywhere etc. so he would go home and have A drink. Fast forward four years, we recently broke up about a few weeks ago (many reasons) and he wants us to stay in each other's lives. I love him dearly, but. I dont know if i should stick around for him.....im not sure just how much he drinks at this point (we dont live together etc.) all i know for sure is he goes through AT LEAST one handle (1.75L, 70 proof) a week at this point. at least.

and ive been noticing as of late (last few months, but im sure its been longer) that hes been drinking like...first thing in the morning. for example. about a month ago his mother needed his help with something- called him up and asked him to come over - he declined and told me its because he had already been drinking at 11am and didnt want her to know so he made up an excuse. < this is the type of behavior i have noticed is increasing lately. he keeps the handle by his bed - and i just always assumed it was for easy access when hes relaxing/gaming at night - but now i realize (naive that i didnt realize it sooner i know) that hes basically drinking all the time. hes admitted to me that hes a functioning alcoholic.

hes severely depressed. and lately hes begun to have the shortest temper i have ever seen - he gets angry at the drop of a hat. when we were breaking up one minute he would say: i know, im sad too trust me and then i would say something like: i just dont know how to feel - and he would take a deep breath or make a noise and then: DUDE. YOURE STARTING TO ANNOY ME HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU NEED TO SAY I DONT KNOW. < which, sure i can be obnoxious lol but. the level of anger is what im really trying to point out.

\- he has stopped speaking to his mother, and two brothers (all for different reasons)

\- we are now broken up - he has said very firmly he has no plans for us to ever be together again (breakup was his call, he said he cant handle a relationship, no drama, etc. - im respecting his decision but of course four years is a long time so we have talked a few times since about what went wrong etc.)

\- at least one handle a week, pot daily. and im not sure about other drugs at this point unfortunately, he has never done them during our relationship (as far as i know) but he has in the past (parties, etc.) and lately i have been wondering.

POINT IS: He desperately and nicely asked me to be his friend. Said that he didnt want me to not be in his life, he just didnt want us to be together anymore. - he clearly has a lot of issues (mental, emotional, etc.) and i still love him and care for him deeply. I dont know if he is going to get help. I have asked, i suggested ALANON at one point - he said no. I have been reading around on here with other peoples experiences and from what i GATHER - its not looking good for him.

Should i stick around as a friend?.....i am worried he is going to get worse.....but i also dont know if i can handle being dragged down with him (almost finished with my degree and currently preparing for grad school applications).

I would feel guilty not sticking around and he gets worse - im not really sure what to do here.

Edited to include: I am also really concerned for his health - which is another reason as to why im considering sticking around it is ALSO a reason why im considering not sticking around - i assume his health cant be good at this point.

Any advice is welcomed, thank you so much!

* Last edit i promise: part of the reason why we broke up: he was supposed to take my son and I out - and the night before our plans (that i had paid for in advance) he got incredibly drunk, slept all day, and couldn't make it anymore as he woke up at about 4am and couldnt get back to sleep so he cancelled our plans essentially day of. i got pissed, and he got pissed that i got pissed and the fight led to our ultimate break up ",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977839589118958}"

What I really can't stand about my drinking is that I can't function. I'm constantly having to save face. It wrecks my sleep. It leads me to doing other bad stuff. But sometimes it doesn't. That's why I always come back around and test the waters. It's embarrassing how dysfunctional I am when it comes to alcohol. Normally I'm just a nice guy. People would describe me as shy or quiet even. 

I just hate that it impacts my jobs, school, and social life. Are functional drinkers just typically type A people? Or is there anyone else like me who has just faced shitstorms when it comes to holding down a job and other responsibilities?",47,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983931183815002}"
2021-04-06 00:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ml3dbg/is_this_possible/,Is this possible,Hi I’m a 22 yo female that started drinking at 16. Last year I did inpatient rehab for two weeks until I got covid and had to do the rest of the program online for the remaining year of 2020. I’m just curious to what people think of this topic. Do you think one can go back to drinking and be fine? It’s so hard as I do like the social aspect of drinking and I can’t avoid it. I can’t go on social media without my friends posting pictures of going out and I can’t even hang out with my friends anymore because they drink. I’m alone all the time at home and have no friends anymore because I can’t do anything. It really sucks because it was fun going out to bars  and people always say oh you’re not missing out on anything but yeah I kind of am. Of course I know there’s people out there that are the same as me and don’t engage in drinking so frequently or at all but it just sucks. My parents tell me “you’ll never be able to drink again and you can never drink again” and that just makes it even worse and makes me want to drink just to prove them wrong. I hate being this way and just want to be a normal college student. A couple days ago I had a drink and got blacked out because my tolerance is basically nothing since I don’t drink anymore. Like just great I ruined it on the first try. I just don’t know. I’m thinking of going to a wellness center in California for my mental health and maybe that will help. I just feel left out because I am left out now. The good thing is I honestly do not think I could go back to drinking everyday so heavily. I know there is a possibility but drinking so much completely ruined my life and I can never go down that path again. Idk I’m just confused and genuinely hate life lol at this point I’m like okay well this sucks and my mental health has been shit for a decade now so what’s the point in anything. Even if it gets better it has the get worse at some point again. Idk who I am or what to do. There are so many more factors that go into this but it’s just so much to delve into.,1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995083749294281}"

My body is rapidly changing nowadays and I feel ill most of the time. The past month I have been having incredibly terrifying night terrors when trying to sleep sober. The first couple of times I didn’t think much of it, but it’s just about every day now, and it makes me afraid to even take a nap during the day, which doesn’t help with my alcohol use. It starts as I’m about to fall asleep. I become very dizzy, and that feeling alone is usually enough to make me try and rip myself from sleep, but when I do I go directly into sleep paralysis. If I’m able to get past the dizziness I fall into a very brief, light sleep where my dreams are extremely vivid, and sometimes I’m even able to lucid dream. I’ve “heard voices” during this sleep paralysis phase as well, but it feels more as if I have a paranoid thought and someone very loudly starts rapidly repeating that thought into my ear. I have to go through the sleep paralysis/light vivid dreaming about 3-5 times before I finally get to fully sleep. I was wondering if this is possibly an uncommon withdrawal symptom as it only happens when I’m sober, and is typically accompanied by my lesser, more familiar symptoms like sweating and hand tremors? Could this be a result of the increased anxiety I experience because of withdrawal?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9945123195648193}"

I still remember vividly the day I decided quit this shit once and for all. The night before I didn’t do anything particularly embarrassing I sat on the porch on May 31st with my brothers girlfriend we split a bottle of Tito’s and finished off the night with high octane cans of craft beer (Ick) I blacked out the last part of the night and broke my glasses. I woke up dry mouth pounding headache and worse was the depression and anxiety it was worse than any other feeling I had previously had. I was miserable and had a dark cloud surrounding me of negativity and pain, I didn’t get out of bed for most of the day which was a beautiful Sunny start to the month of June. Previously during lock down I had numerous failed attempts to quit and this one failure seemed too hard to bare. I felt hopeless like a failure who only brought pain and suffering to everyone around me. I remember being stuck in my head feeling like I was a defective person a broken misfit who as hard as I tried just couldn’t get it right. I knew if I kept this up I was going to be so filled with shame and depression and the feelings of being a failure to everyone around me would one day be too hard to bare. I wanted out of this life and I knew that if I kept going something awful would happen either at my own hands or a drunk accident or the slow death of cirrhosis or liver failure. 

I almost started to seal my faith when I had a glimmer of hope one last ounce of self love I reached out to a friend. He took me on a drive and showed me the big book and told me to read the first chapter, he was tough and militant about it but it was only out of love that he acted this way. I always thought I was a very self aware intelligent person who always understood the concepts of sobriety but they never clicked. Why? Because I thought I knew it all, turns out I didn’t. I read the first chapter in the book and slowly I started to understand my disease. I couldn’t drink like a normal person I just couldn’t. I surrendered to it I squashed the idea that I could ever drink again and slowly I learned how to finally let go. Now I don’t go to meetings and haven’t read the whole book but I study the concept that stuck with me and slowly the bigger picture emerged. I found my own path to spirituality and check myself when I find I’m getting too cocky and realize my sobriety is fragile and when I’m feeling like I want a drink I meditate on it and it passes. It’s not easy, the first month was the hardest but good things started to happen that kept me going. Things that would have never happened had I not gotten sober. I learn more and more about myself every day and I realize there’s always more to learn, it’s like being a newborn and you have to relearn what it’s like to live again as a new person living a sober life. 

The point I’m trying to make is I am you, I am the person who never thought I could do it, but if you change a thought and perspective and look at sobriety in a slightly different way that works for you it will stick. Everyones journey is different but if you want this you can have it too❤️",82,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9802563190460205}"

I've barely seen him since he started this process. He used alcohol as a coping mechanism for depression and anxiety for years, so I know it must be so difficult to let it go. He's going through some withdrawals, and is isolating himself. 

Should I let him just do his thing alone or keep texting him encouraging stuff? I don't know if it's helpful or annoying at this point.

A little background context: My father is a non drinking alcoholic and regularly attends AA (He stopped drinking approx 20 years ago). My parents are separated and I have no relationship with my father. My sister rarely drinks and my mother is similar to my drinking patterns. I am 32 female and feel my drinking has progressed over the years and isnt ""normal"".

From about 22 onwards, I began renting and being an ""adult"" I started to drink wine at home, progressing from Friday nights only, to Friday and Saturdays only, and then to Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the last two years (A sunday occasionally also). My night would typically be a bottle of wine and approx 2 vodkas. My mother and partner have a very chilled attitude towards drinking and it is almost ""funny"" that we love our cosy wine nights. I am from Ireland and not to stereotype, but I feel in this circumstance the stereotype fits.

I function very well in the sense it has never impacted relationships, career etc. However I always choose a ""cosy wine night"" over anything else sociable. Why would I go to the cinema when I could have wine by the fire? Why would I meet a friend for a walk when I would prefer to chill with wine? I feel my motivation on the weekends is low as I'm always tired. We moved into a new house two years ago and the decorating always gets put on the long finger because of tiredness. 

My partner and I have been trying for a baby for over a year. I have to admit...the thoughts of not drinking for a year made my stomach twinge. I have found out last week that I am now 6 weeks pregnant. I am responsible and would not dare to have a drink during pregnancy. This weekend has been my first weekend in most likely ten years that I have not drank alcohol. I am surprised how well it went and actually how content I felt without alcohol. I felt more motivated and willing to do walks etc. I feel almost proud of myself that there can be more to life than wine.

I really feel that I want this to continue after pregnancy and not just be a 8 month thing. I want my attitude towards drink and socialising to change. My gut is that I could potentially become more reliant on alcohol as I get older. I want it to be a given that I am not drinking every weekend and more of an opt in to having the occasional glass of wine.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8869287967681885}"

TL;DR - my mom struggles with mental health issues and substance abuse, and I want to know how much can be attributed to her disease and how much of it can be attributed to emotional abuse.

Hello everyone. My (23F) mom (59F) has been an alcoholic ever since I can remember. My childhood was fine, but clouded by days where things were just bad. I remember one day in fourth grade when I came home to my mom passed out in her bed and had to deal with the situation (even though I didn’t really understand the entire circumstances and was super freaked out).

Anyway, her substance abuse also triggered me to develop an eating disorder where I exhibited extreme symptoms for over a year, and had to seek multiple sources of medical intervention during high school. Through therapy, I learned that my inability to control her drinking led me to develop anorexia. I asked my mom multiple times to stop drinking and she didn’t.

Fast forward to November 2019: I had been living in West Africa for 5 months with limited contact due to spotty cell service. I get a message from her saying that she lost her job because of her drinking and was going into rehab for a month. I was happy she was getting help, but at the same time, I was angry that she waited to get help until it drastically affected her own life.

Background: I was evacuated back to the US in March 2020 due to covid, and was communicating with her about my flight updates and estimated arrival. She was living at her house with her husband, my dad, at the time, after moving back into the house spontaneously one day when she decided she didn’t want to live with roommates at her sober house anymore. So, right before I board my flight, in an emotional state, I call her to tell her that I’m on my way back and the flight details. In this call, she tells me that she is leaving to go to stay at her friend’s house on the east coast (over 20 hours driving from the house) and will not be home when I arrive. She said she made this decision because she was worried about staying sober with changed living situation dynamics. (There were other living options she rejected that were in the same general geographic area as the house.)

Fast forward: I am going to outline events that have occurred in the past two months.
1. Her mom’s (my grandma’s) birthday. She felt bad that she couldn’t see her mom in person for her birthday this year (her mom lives a couple of hours from the house) and requested that we do something for her. My brother and I had already planned to spend the day with grandma, but my mom micromanaged and requested specific things that we do. My mom told grandma about certain things she wanted us to do over the phone, which made grandma expect certain things. Not wanting to disappoint grandma, but not wanting to cave into the distant requests of my mom, my brother and I oblige. I spend over a day getting things ready and planning. I get her a cake. I order her favorite food from a restaurant. I get a bottle of champagne. I make a special fruit salad. I get her a card. I buy and wrap her a gift. I fill up the car with gas. I make sure my brother knows the plan and do all the dishes for my grandma during our visit to her house (she had a stroke and has limited mobility). My brother prints off a spa gift certificate my mom had sent him to give grandma, and he adds a few clip art pictures and changes the font to make it look slightly better. The response we got: my brother gets a lovey-dovey email from her thanking him for all the effort he has put into grandma’s birthday. I send my mom a picture of everything we did to make her day special, and she sends back a message “eww, purple frosting??”
2. My partner lives fairly close to my mom and I visit him as much as possible around our work schedules and covid. My mom’s relatives, with whom I’m very close, also live in the same general area. My relatives invited me, my partner, my mom, and her friend over for dinner one day when I will be in town soon. My mom initially accepts, then states that a different friend is coming to visit her the same day. The friend cannot see my relatives for COVID reasons. My mom requests that I do not see my relatives, but rather only see her and her two friends for dinner. (Add’l info: my mom has recently spent a week with the visiting friend at a resort. The last time I have seen my mom was in October.) I state that I plan on dinner with the relatives as planned and will see my mom a different day. After further reflection, however, I don’t know if my mom deserves to see me.

I know in addition to substance abuse, my mom has anxiety and depression. She has been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist for over 20 years, but she’s also not very self aware, so to me it seems like she has made little progress and has no long-term goals (besides staying sober). She has been gone over a year and still does not have a plan to return to the house or even state. She has no plan for when her friend inevitably dies and she must find an alternative living situation (the friend is 91 years old).

I guess my question to anyone who might have the time, energy, and interest to respond is: am I being cognizant enough of her mental health issues and substance abuse when thinking about the whole situation, or is she gaslighting me and being emotionally abusive? I want to support her, but she makes me so upset in every interaction that we have that I always end up crying on and off for a day after talking to her.

Any and all input is appreciated, and I thank each and every one of you for taking the time to help me understand. So proud of all of you here and sending hugs.",2,{'covid': 3},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986365437507629}"

I really don’t want to and it sounds stupid but I feel like I need alcohol in my life. Just a bit of background story- I can go weeks without drinking but when I do drink it will be for like 3 day bender, il drink as soon as I get up in the morning, go to the shop at 7am for alcohol etc. And I keep saying to myself il just have a few drinks this time and be normal but I always get drunk, spend loads of money and make the most stupidest decisions that I wouldn’t have done sober. 

The one main issue is I have social anxiety, I drink for confidence that is why I drink. I don’t know what I’ll do because I don’t even talk to people sober apart from my boyfriend and my mum, I feel like il have no life.

2021-04-03 21:31:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mjm3y4/when_do_functioning_alcoholics_throw_in_the_towel/,When do “functioning” alcoholics throw in the towel?,"Hi. I’m brand new to this community (28F) I kinda diagnosed myself as an alcoholic this past January after I realized I completely lost control of my alcohol consumption. Its not a very severe case. I’m probably in some category of “functioning alcoholic” as I’ve never let it get to a point where I’ve entered a horrible downward spiral. So, deciding whether I’m a true alcoholic or just let a bad habit get too out of hand due to the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has been a big question to me lately.

Since I was 20, Ive always been a big drinker. I usually drink everyday and have for as long as I can remember. Sometimes it is truly just 1 drink, usually 2-3, sometimes 4. Weekends- who knows. For years I controlled my drinking by just never buying alcohol or having it in the house because I realized that if it’s in the fridge I’m drinking it. Luckily, I had the control to not buy it. But I think the pandemic was a very alcoholism- enabling time that allowed me to day drink with no one knowing and my control to not buy it withered away somewhat. Like most people, I was not very happy during the pandemic, and I very much prefer to be happy. Alcohol made me very happy. 

When I drink, I don’t get violent, mean, or even all that irresponsible. I don’t drink and drive, or accidentally break things or hurt myself. I sometimes believe that alcohol makes me nicer, more easygoing, confident, creative, etc. The worst thing I do is drink when I have a lot of work to do, then accidentally get drunk and not being able to finish my work that night. I’m a graduate student so working after hours is very common and often necessary so I am negatively impacting this after-hours work. When I drink, I really really enjoy myself, and usually drink until I feel sick, fall asleep, or finish whatever I have. Sometimes I cry and get horrible acid reflux, then feel nauseous.

Sometime after the pandemic started, I discovered how great it felt to drink when doing unpleasant things, like working.  It became my preference to be drinking all the time. It slowly started with me drinking earlier and earlier in the day till the point where I’d wake up at 7am and want a drink, and often pour myself one. I’d drink during Zoom calls with my boss pretending it was tea, drink on my walk to my work once that finally opened up again, and since we were at lower capacity and boss wasn’t there, sometimes I’d drink while at work- then do my experiments! I drank while virtually teaching a class of undergrads to calm my nerves (and did relatively well with it!) At work no one could get near me to smell me, or see my purple teeth from the red wine cause I had a mask on. I knew I shouldn’t do it but it made me happier! And overall career-wise I was still doing fairly well despite drinking so much.

What really alarmed me though was I knew I shouldn’t be drinking at work or while working or drinking so much in general because that is just not good for your body!! But no matter how hard I tried to set rules for myself this voice in my head DID NOT respect them. I always found a reason that I deserved a bottle of wine or a 6-pack of IPAs. When working from home, I just couldn’t resist a sneaky 9am glass of wine.

I knew I couldn’t keep it up. My chest hurt, my sleep quality suffered. I felt nauseous many mornings, my acid reflux persisted for days and it hurt so. damn. bad. Luckily, the past 3 years I’ve participated in sober February and I honor the fuck out of that, and I feel like this year I reached February crawling on the ground. I finally admitted to my boyfriend that I drink all the time starting in the morning and I hide it from him. I told 1 other friend and a couple family members what I’d been up to as well. They were like “oh yeah that’s bad” and suggested I take a break from alcohol, but they think I shouldn’t be too hard on myself since it was the pandemic and that maybe I just let a bad habit get too out of hand. “Cant you just limit your drinking to weekends or when you’re not alone?” I mean yeah maybe for the first month or two but after that idk?! I’ve been sober 62 days (since Feb 1st) and feel so much better, but I’m going on a family vacation in May and I’m toying with the idea of drinking with my family (since drinking is like, a big part of our family). IDK! I have no alcoholic friends or family and I think people think I am being dramatic. How do “functioning” alcoholics decide to call it quits? What has to *happen* for you, as well as friends and family, to be convinced that alcohol should not hold a role in your life anymore? Am I at that point or not yet? Do I need a DUI? To lose my house? My boyfriend to leave me? To get fired? To get esophageal cancer? When do you stop?!

TLDR; I’ve been a slight alcoholic since college but functioning pretty well despite snd mostly had it under control. In the pandemic my drinking got worse and out of my control. Still not sure if I am a true alcoholic and have to keep alcohol out of life forever, or if I can learn to manage it to be able to have it on special occasions, like a family vacation, without entering the daily drinking/morning drinking habit again.",14,"{'pandemic': 6, 'mask': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9613378643989563}"

I have always had feeling of regret and self hatred because I've said and done many horrible things to people and embarrassed myself countless times. I ended up in a cycle of drinking to suppress those feelings and then giving myself more reasons to hate myself, and I'm now trying to find new coping mechanisms that work long term. 

I was doing ok-ish (not good, but coping enough to function) and then a week ago I had a massive argument and cut ties with someone who was my best friend for many years and the next day he decided to leave me one last long message detailing many of the shitty things I've done while drunk and why my partner should leave me, how vile and disgusting I am etc and it's seriously fucked me up. None of this was relevant to the original argument we were having so it completely caught me off guard. I KNOW I've been a shitty person for years and I'm really trying to accept that and be a better person, but that was an ultra low blow to give me when I'm already seriously struggling to recover from this 6 year long addiction. I guess he only did it to make himself feel better but I feel so much worse now and I'm seriously doubting my character and worth.

It's really caused me to spiral and I haven't slept since, I'm genuinely afraid that I'll just keep getting worse and give in to alcohol again, or worse.

I am a 25 yo male with a good job, a good home life, and no obvious sign of alcohol related issues. I do not drink that much frequently now but when I was in college (3 years go) I was ""great"" at it. I drank hard multiple days a week all 4 years. It would have been a rare event if I did not get blasted over the weekend. I did not drink much before college. 

About two years ago I notice a something changed in my brain. It was like I had flipped a switch. I went from not thinking about drinking accept for maybe the anticipation of a party to the ""I need a drink"" feeling. For the first time I craved alcohol, I had that feeling of wanting a drink. I could smell a beer even though there was not one in the room. I would get excited about drinking. I have not had anything to drink in the past 30 days because I feel like with each sip I am one step closer to becoming an uncontrollable drinker. Over the past year I can feel my urges creeping stronger.

I have talked to my girlfriend about this but she does not want to hear about it. She is 24 yo and still drinks very heavily. She does not want the party to end with me not drinking. Most of my friends are heavy drinkers and I am going to see them in two weeks and you can bet getting plastered is on the to-do list. 

I am not sure what to do at this point. I want to continue to live a healthy life unencumbered by the chains of alcoholism, but I do not know what I should do.

Should I tell by friends about my situation?   
Should I go to an AA meeting (do I just show up/ is this the right place for someone like me)?   
Should I try the Sinclair Method to stop the addition before it is too late?   
Is it ok for me to drink once in a while, on special occasions? 

I am asking alcoholics and people who have worked/lived with them. By sharing your experience, what should I do?

For a long time a family member of mine has had a drinking problem. She doesnt classify it as such but rather “something to help the constant pain my body is in”. This family member, call her Pam, was in the trades for quite some time - so her pain is understandable. 

Now, Pam works a job where shes required to walk up some ladders and go out of the office, but not extremely often, and when she comes home, she drinks to numb the pain. Shes recently tried CBD and says it doesnt help and says things that frustrate the living hell out of me. An example of this happened about an hour ago. She made a screwdriver and said “orange juice for my vitamin c and vodka to kill the coronavirus”

Not to mention - pam is severely overweight and never goes to the doctors. Never gets checkups or anything. Shes recently developed a cough and says “itll just go away because i’ve felt this before”

Another thing to note is that she mixes the alcohol with OTC’s like tylenol and ibuprofen, thinking this will somehow numb the pain. Shes been doing this now for probably the past 10 years.

No good eating habits. No good lifestyle choices. Sits in front of the TV all day. Never works out. Not many friends.

I've been using weed for a year, but it's been giving me a lot of bad trips, not the great times it did at first. I tend to enjoy more on alcohol, but I've found myself starting to get the feeling that weed gives me now, curled up in bed yelling about how cringe I am and how much I hate myself. This might not (or maybe it does, I don't know) seem like an issue yet, but I've started to notice something a little worrying.

I'd tell myself I'd not drink the next day, but then I'd have a shitty day at work, then I'd get drunk again. It's got to the point where I won't even enjoy the drunkeness, but I'm seeking that feeling it gave me at first.

It started off with me getting beer by UberEats during the pandemic, as I was too shy to walk into an LCBO (Ontario) or Beer Store. I'd order like 6 tall cans and drink 3-4 and get drunk enough to where I couldn't pass my own fake sobriety tests. I eventually stopped, as UberEats is an insanely expensive way to get beer. Eventually I started again and worked up the courage to go into the LCBO and grab Whiskey. I really enjoyed the Whiskey, it tasted really nice( surprisingly as I thought it'd be super strong and I'd have to spit it out at first) and got me drunk, though still pretty expensive. First night I drank half the bottle (the bottles I get are 750 ml) on the way home, it was great! I watched PAW Patrol (one of my favourites) and it was a super fun night, enhanced by the alcohol. Then the next day I drank the other half. Why? I don't know, it was another fun night. Just a few days later (technically the next week, that's what I tell myself), I went down to the LCBO and picked up another bottle of Whiskey, and drank half of it that night. I noticed that it wasn't really the same, though still pretty fun. I told myself that I'd save this for my days off and drink it slowly. I didn't, I had a shitty day at work and drank the rest the next day, then I started feeling the same effect weed did after it stopped being nice, I hated myself and starting yelling about how cringe I was, while curled up in bed, thinking about killing myself and everything. 

Now, I may have bipolar, my doctor thinks so. My mood swings go super hard, I was manic just last week and it was really embarassing at work... basically jumping all over the walls... It may be that when I have my depressive episodes (opposite of manic) that the alcohol/drugs enhance those negative feelings? I don't know. I do know I get these very negative thoughts while sober too, but alcohol and other drugs may trigger them. But I don't want to become reliant on alcohol, but I don't want to give it up either, as it's really fun.

Should I be worried? I'm starting to get the urge to buy a case of beer for some fun nights again, but I don't want to overdo it, and I told myself I'd stop drinking for a while...

There's days (like today) where I'm having only 2 drinks. That's it. Nothing more. 

And then there's days I want to ""get turnt"" and I'll have 4 maybe 5. Shots usually end the night quick. Shit after 3 I was heavily feeling it. But proceeded to drink and sip a Hard Seltzer. Was I drunk? Absolutely. Did I stop drinking? No. 

I'm 26. I feel like I have the tendency to over drink which may, without my introspective nature, lead to a drinking issue.

I really do want to quit and ive had periods were i stopped drinking for months but i get goaded into drinking again by my mom, who im now forced to live with, who is also an alcoholic. She buys us packs of beer and tequila to share. We both know that we both have tried to quit and we're both failing miserably at being sober. I dont know what to do, i can only move in with family right now and the only one i can live with who isnt drinking is my abusive father who i also got into a drunken fist fight with recently. Im definitely falling fast, i ruined my life about three times over and i dont know what to do

How do you make that shift? I went to aa before and i dodnt feel like one of them. Not judging but ive never drink and drive or passed out in public. I show up to work everday and make a good living.

My concern is that, even without alcohol, he has never been that self-aware nor willing to change his own behaviour, and has a history of behaviour that could be qualified as abusive. My mum is not that capable of being effectively supportive, it's just not something she can process. I can't do much, because he doesn't listen to me. At the moment, I think he's just too drunk much of the time to even really understand what people are saying to him - I'm sure it's affected his brain. So, we don't think he's capable of making any sort of change without professional help. He's seen a therapist, but used to buy alcohol on the way home, and I think she tended to fall for his self-justifications and lying about how much he was drinking, tbh - he needs to have to be honest, with himself.

I had three years once and threw it away around 2 years ago. After that I met my sponsor who literally saved my life. I’d had sponsors before who followed the rules of AA to the T. Like how close they got to me or who I chose my higher power to be etc. and none of them lasted. They all would get overwhelmed with my mental illnesses. But not this one. She knew mental health just as much as me if not more. She knew me sometimes even more then myself. She was there for me practically whenever I needed her. If she couldn’t be there right away because she was a mom she was definitely there the moment she was free. 

2 weeks ago today my sponsor passed away. She was clean and happy and beautiful, but had severe COPD. I knew her COPD was getting worse but I honestly didn’t even think it was a deadly disease. I was with her the day prior. I had spend a week with her. Her lungs collapsed while she was trying to do her breathing treatment machine. 

It feels like my heart has been ripped out of me and shred to pieces. She was literally family to me. She was more then my sponsor. She was everything I needed at the perfect time. I don’t know how to do this anymore. 

Her sponsor took over my sponsor ship but I’m pretty sure she’s used. She has some crazy ass advice. Brought some super sketch people to the funeral and is just acting super weird.
