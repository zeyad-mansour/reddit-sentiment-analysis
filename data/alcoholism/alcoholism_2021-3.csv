Lately, I've been getting to a point of just getting something in me each night, so I at least recognize the night before.

This is not necessarily my choice, but by circumstance, because of work, getting outside now that it's not winter, and my car breaking down. I've been a lot less depressed lately, but I feel almost more dependent on drinking than before ever before.

Even after a great day with friends and a short work schedule, it feels almost more needed to pound a few drinks down and feel something before bed.",11

If it wasn't alcohol it was fetanyl or 30 prescription pills a day... no lie. We have been together for four years. He had a year and a half sober.. until today.. I've been there with him through the rehab stints. Through stolen rent money. Through stealing money and abuse in general. Through all the lies. I stay because I love this man. We have 2 kids together. He is a great dad and the most caring kind hearted person regardless of where he has come from. He was in rehab a little less than month ago to get off suboxone.. amd5 has continually been in outpatient. He sees 3 counselors a week and does 2 groups. He got a new job. Abruptly. We got into a huge argument because this is what he wanted to do and for once he was doing something for him. I expected him home at 5. 6 rolls around and I receive a text..

Babe im sorry I relapsed. I'm getting a hotel and I'm very sorry.


Seriously? I don't even know what to say. The last relapse was so bad. I literally said I wouldn't marry him unless he could be sober for a year. Actually every relapse has been bad. One episode of him freaking out even infront of our daughter and choking me that he can't remember. I was serious. I wanted off the merry go round of rehab and everything. This has broken my trust in so many ways. And he finally gets my trust back and what happens. This.

Props for being truthful. But I don't know how to move forward from this. It brings back so many worse memories with it.

I understand relapse happens. And I'm hoping this won't turn into the other ones that go into a full blown bender because he goes into fuck it mode. I dont know...",21

Edit to add:

Thanks for the responses so far y’all!

To add context, the last few weeks consisted of me shaking like a leaf at work until I could come home and start drinking. And by drinking, I mean a minimum of 8 shots of 100 proof liquor. There were a few nights I drank half a liter. 

Today, I’m nauseated, shaking pretty badly, anxious, depressed, have no appetite, brain-foggy, have a pretty bad headache, and just generally feel like absolute trash. I have a 6 day work week starting Thursday & am getting worried it’s going to interfere with my job :/",13

After reading through a lot of other people’s stories I had some questions about withdrawals. I’m wondering why some people experience horrendous symptoms like shaking and hallucinations after binge drinking and others barely experience anything. Headaches, loss of appetite, etc. are all common hangover symptoms and there are people who are well into their 40’s, 50’s and older who all experience these mild symptoms even after a binge. Why do some people who are younger develop terrible withdrawals? Is it simply due to quantity consumed or are physical or mental issues at play? I’m wondering because everyone in my family who has had drinking problems never had as bad of withdrawals as I did and it never made sense to me. Thank you for your replies.",4
2021-03-30 11:34:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mgipfh/sleeping_problems_is_it_seizure/,Sleeping problems is it seizure?,Hi everyone i’m 22 f I’ve been drinking pretty heavy for over a year and since COVID it’s way more than i used to. In these 2 days I’ve been having weird sleep problems. 2 days ago I drank about a little more than half of 750 ml vodka. I went to sleep woke up at 8 pm normal than I tried going to sleep again. And I had a vivid nightmare where I was in the back of a car and I was extremely drunk about to faint and my friend kept telling me to wake up. I felt like I would die if I didn’t wake up at that moment. I ended up forcing my body to wake up and I felt like my voice and conciousness was gone for a few seconds before I actually woke up. Today I had no drinks since 2 days ago I had the same dream while I was about to fall asleep and had to force myself to wake up. I don’t think I ever had a real seizure and if I did I wouldn’t be able to tell if it’s seizure cause I don’t know what it feels like. But it was really scary I googled about alcholic deliriums and the likelihood of getting it and I definitely drink the amount of alcohol it says u would need to be drinking to get it. I’m now scared to go to sleep and it’s hard to go to sleep. I hope it doesn’t worsen but did anyone have experience like this? I’m also diagnosed with anxiety and panic attack but never had my sleep interrupted like this. Just reading about all the complications I can have from alcohol is freaking me out I want to lessen my weekly usage if it doesn’t worsen. I’ve been drinking heavy daily 5-6 days a week.,10

I was a social drinker prior to divorce. The amount I drank increased over time and soon I was drinking until I dozed off sitting on my couch almost every night.  After about 2 years of this nightly drinking, I developed tinnitus - piercing ringing in my ears.  Now it is hard to fall asleep without being rather drunk.

The last 3 weeks I have cut back on alcohol about 50%.  I find it very difficult to fall asleep.  A few nights I was 100% sober I felt some slight chest pains and anxiety.  Is this just a matter of training my body to fall asleep naturally and it will get better over time?",12

It’s only natural to assume that a change in lifestyle, will alter the way you walk, talk, dress and etc. Everyone has a picture in their head of what they think “clean"" living looks like. White picket fences, happy families, chia lattes, church on Sundays and actually having a conversation with our neighbours. For some people that works, however if your anything like me, it can be detrimental and cause more harm than good.

I started questioning everything, including myself just trying to make sense of it all, in a search to find who I really was. So much time was spent moulding some form of myself, I thought I wanted, I thought I needed. On the flipside, I wouldn’t call it a total waste of time because in doing all these new things I learnt and picked up skills along the way.

One day it just clicked to stop putting pressure on myself to chase an ideal I thought existed, I thought I wanted. There’s already enough pressure and stress associated with getting sober and you don’t need to add to that by worrying about things such as keeping up with the Joneses. No one on this earth is “perfect” and you don’t need to be “perfect” to be sober.

\- He drinks 50-150mL in increments and vomits into a bucket immediately after. He has been doing that for at least the past 3 days. 

\- Painful diarrhoea 

\- Acts very confused sometimes, and says random things out loud into the room... im really not sure if he is having hallucinations or what. He is quite verbally agressive and asks my siblings and I to sit with him and hold his hand. Then he forgets that we were there a minute ago and demands us to come in again. 

\- Absolutely refuses to go to the hospital, they wont take him without consent either. We've forced him before, in the past, but he just runs out.   


How much longer does he have left? It's the worst I have ever seen him, I was sure he would no longer be with us soon but he is still holding up. Is it possible that he might actually survive this?

Edit: its been some days since this post. My grandmother (dads mum) pretty much saved him over a period of 3 days and two nights by slowly dosing down the alcohol ammount she allowed him to have despite his frightening behaviour. She hid all the bottles. A bit of medication did the trick too. It was a battle to say the least. My father is now almost back to a normal and functioning person. At least he appears so on the outside. It's been a wild ride, as usual, but grandma is a warrior. I know I will still have a lot to deal with in the future, but it's nice to exist in the calm before the storm. Now its just that awkward period where everyone pretends nothing even happened. 

Thank you everyone for your responses, I am terribly sorry for what a lot of you are going/ have gone through and I wish you all well.",8

I didn't really care for it, I was a nerd, never partied, was fit, and in general happy without any vices. Would always say no to hookah, weed, etc. I grew up with amazing parents and siblings. By the time I was 24 (graduated 2017 with an MS in EE) I finally got my own place in Dallas working as an engineer and at the time I hardly drank. Like maybe twice a year I'd drink and both those times I'd get black out drunk with hard liquor partying with close friends who visited out of state. I was a noob, so the hangovers were dreadful enough for me to never touch it again. 

I'd never buy beer, even though I enjoyed being tipsy in social gatherings, and I'd especially never buy liquor. I never drank alone and to this day never really drink alone. Come end the of 2018, a friend of mine who doesn't even drink suggested we pick up some beers to take back home, and I was hesitant at first because I never brought beer or liquor to just casually drink, but he insisted and fuck it, I caved. 

After that night, I'd start buying a 6 pack to last 1 week or 12 packs to last 2-3 weeks of light stuff like Blue Moons. And it was no big deal, I was still relatively fit, cooked my own meals, and enjoyed living alone. I played guitar, watched Netflix and built hobby level electronics. I'd have a beer whenever I wanted to relax and watch Netflix. Eventually I moved out of Dallas because I disliked my job. 

I now have been living in a new state closer to home since the beginning of 2019 and share an apt with my brother, who also works as an engineer. The first few months we'd always invite old college friends over and at most would drink beers every OTHER weekend because the prior weekend we'd drive up to our parents place. So it was very relaxing and chill. We weren't addicts, we were both pretty fit and all was good until we threw our first house party. Invited like 10+ friends over for a weekend stay and we partied hard af, getting 2-3 bottles of Bacardi and/or Captain Morgan. 

But the hangovers were bad enough that we still weren't addicted. We still drank typically every other weekend except now, instead of beer, we'd get a 5th to split amongst ourselves. It's usually me, my brother and a close by college buddy. Now what became a 5th became a 6 pack + a 5th in about 2 months. Next few months, we're drinking beers on weekdays and partying hard on weekends. It's now a 6 pack IPAs, and a 5th and a pint of 40% liquor. This continued on for all of 2019. I had lost so much muscle and could rarely motivate myself to cook or lift. 

Then 2020 happens and COVID hits...

We can work from home...i.e we can get lit on weekdays and weekends. All of 2020 we essentially abused the fuck out of our livers. Not daily but perhaps we'd get drunk atleast 2-3 times a week. If we ever gone a week without drinking it was miraculous, and if we ever hit 2 weeks without we felt that we deserved to debaucher. Towards Fall 2020 the post-hangover anxiety, nightmares and irritatable sleep started occurring and thats when I realized this is getting out of hand. Then my brother and I started making a conscious effort to slow down. So we have stopped drinking on weekdays and now give ourselves about a week break before binging again. This has allowed me to start cooking and become relatively fit again. 

This past week we vacationed off to AZ with some friends and spent all 9 nights debauchering till we blacked out. And because we had long drives in the morning and BNB check outs we had to leave early and hence I hardly got any sleep. I've never drank 9 nights in a row but mentally I feel the worst I've ever felt in a while being back 2 days ago. So I'm 3 days sober now.. My days are fine but my nights are anxious, my head gets filled with creepy nightmarish imagery, im afraid to fall asleep in fear of nightmares, and have a mental fog...It just gets weird. Currently I have zero cravings. But I know that this has to stop. I've only really been binge drinking for 2.5 years, that an amount I can recover from. When I hear stories of +10 years, I simply can't imagine the pain. My goal now is to hit 2 weeks sober. I have to be able to do it and I won't let me or any friend talk me out of it. 

Jesus christ, this is one sneaky motherfuckin drug. Thank you for listening, I had to get this out. Peace.",14

I’m a uni student (20s, F) and have always gone a bit overboard with drinking at parties with my friends etc and have definitely done lots of clown shit while drunk. However, my days of crying and puking and being severely hungover have passed. Overtime, I learned more about my limits but my drinking became something that wasn’t just at parties but more of a thing to relax my racing mind. When not in a pandemic, I would have like 1 drink a couple times during the week, but never huge drinking sessions (only on weekends w friends). There were other things to do and although my relationship w alc wasn’t the healthiest to begin with, I had absolutely no problem stopping myself and if I set a goal not to drink for a few days I’d have no problems meeting it. I always found other ways to calm myself down that work better. 

In a pandemic, it’s hard to do the things that bring you peace. Especially if nothing is in person it’s easy to slip into drinking because you feel isolated and nobody will know bec they’re not seeing you. Over the past month or so my drinking became very compulsive, but I noticed that I’d only use it when I was stressed, and then it became something I kept doing bec I was stressed without it. Long story short, I had my lowest point last weekend where I was drunk for 3 days straight, and my parents found out about my problem, I had to go to urgent care bc I thought I was having withdrawal symptoms and they ended up taking me home. Turns out it wasn’t withdrawal symptoms, but my body was totally shaken up by the amount of anxiety and the amount of alcohol I had been constantly consuming. The drinking got to its worst during the most stressful times during the semester, and I was looking for an “escape” from everything. There wasn’t a time basically the whole semester that I went more than two days without having a drink. Now, I haven’t a drink for a week, which is the longest I’ve gone since January, end I don’t feel the need or desire to drink at all. In fact, I’m kind of appalled by the idea of me drinking because of everything that happened. 

When I left, I happily gave up all my alcohol to my friends and before that while I was packing, I spent hours in my apartment by myself with alcohol in front of me and it wasn’t difficult to not drink it. It’s clear that if I drink at this point in my life, I won’t be able to control myself, so I want to completely abstain for now and that doesn’t scare me one bit. I don’t “miss it” or anything. I know for a fact there are things and people (not any substances) that bring me a greater sense of peace and make me feel better and give me a “high” that alcohol never has or could. 

Knowing all of this, I’m super sad to be home, and surprised that I haven’t had any desire or impulse to drink. I know it’s dangerous not to be honest about this, so I’m actually serious in saying that. 

All of this said, is this alcoholism or was this self- medicating? I’m getting assessed by a substance abuse counsellor and I have a wonderful therapist, and while I was in the midst of it it was hard to see what this actually was because I wasn’t fully honest w my mental health ppl about it, but now I’m opening up and it’s clear to my WHY I wanted to self medicate and that I need to solve those problems and adjust my meds. Now that I have been sober for longer than I have been for a long time and even if I see others drinking I’m not tempted and I don’t feel a “loss” of any sort because I can’t drink right now. I don’t quite know where I stand here. Sorry this was so long! Just want to hear from experience what you guys think!",3

I have drank a case of beer (12) every day for the last 2-3 years. The only time I haven’t was when I had a severe case of mono last summer and couldn’t keep anything down. The mono caused my liver numbers to sky rocket and I had to get routine blood work to get them down. I didn’t have issues with withdrawal then, but I was also so sick so it almost made it easier to stop drinking. 

Anyways, I have read that withdrawal can be deadly in some cases and I just want advice on how to prevent that. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",5

Admit you have a problem, deep down in your heart you know whether you have a problem with alcohol. It's the overwhelming guilt you feel the next morning, the fire in your throat that only stops with another drink, the blackouts, memory loss, self-hatred and shame. When you blow your paycheck in 2 days and have to lie, cheat and steal to feed your habit and survive. All of these things are dead obvious giveaways, that we've all heard before on some daytime tv show drenched with positive anecdotes. However the true test of your character is looking into the mirror and I don't mean a quick glance either. I mean really fucking look at the mirror, stare at yourself and take some time to really analyze yourself.

Are you happy and proud of yourself?

All the self help books, Dr Phil episodes, home remedies and rehab won't do a single thing, unless you admit to yourself you have a problem and really want to change. If you choose to break the chains and shackles of addiction, it's going to be 100% up to you and you alone.

I'm not saying there isn't help available or people you can trust and turn too. I'm saying you need to be open and ready for the change. One of the worst things you can do, is get sober/ clean because of someone else. You are far more likely to relapse and revert to old habits if you use someone as a reward system and never really get to the root problem deep inside yourself. It’s ultimately an anchor holding you still, while the monstrous waves still crash around you and everything looks calm of the surface. But when your anchor disappears or you break free from the anchor you immediately get thrust back into those treacherous waters of alcohol dependence.

My experience was, everyone around me including my family, the people I love and held dearest we're beyond sick of my bullshit and to be fair I was an absolute monster at the time. I went into the detox unit because the few people that didn’t give up on me, wanted me to. It wasn’t until I was stripped bare, literally, mentally and physically that I accepted this was going to be up to me. I accepted the monster I had become and admitted to myself I had a problem. The doors of opportunity opened at that point, even mentally, I was positive about it and ready to confront my inner demons. 

Remember an arrow must for backwards, in order to go forwards and it's up to you how much you pull the drawstring to fire the arrow forward into change.",3

2021-03-29 03:06:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mfjsvy/exposed_neighbor_alcoholism_to_his_wife_by/,Exposed neighbor alcoholism to his wife by accident,"Today I had an incident with a neighbor that was using my recycle cart to dispose beer cans.

Earlier last week I contacted my city recycling department to replace the current cart that has a wheel damaged. They informed me to leave it out front and that they would come and replace within 10 days. One condition for pickup is that the cart remain empty. Coincidentally recycling day came on Thursday and for sure emptied out everything. Still, city hadn’t passed so I left it outside in front of the driveway.

Skip to Sunday afternoon. My father came to visit, and as he left accidentally knocked over the recycle cart. As I went to put it upright, to my surprise, the cart had a 12 pack of beers and separate brown plastic bag with two Hollandia 16 oz beers in it. I was pissed, because it’s been a recurring issue that our trash and recycle carts are used by other people to dispose their trash, ESPECIALLY when they have been emptied already. Also not the first time it’s beer cans and bottles. On top of it being a recurring issue, I’d be damned if the city came and didn’t replace the cart because of trash that wasn’t suppose to be inside.

Nothing I could do except remove the trash and place it in a bag. This is where serendipity came into play. My son woke up from his nap, and as I entered the room my wife opened the window from our second floor that directly looks out to the front where the cart is. At that very exact moment, I recognize a neighbor and his black car pull up in front of our recycle cart and dispose more trash inside. To say that I got HEATED is an understatement. I started banging on the window like a madman thinking he could hear, wife thought I was gonna knock it down. He didn’t hear it, and drove off. Lucky for me, I recognized him and knew which house he stays at, that was right down my street. 

When I looked in the cart, it confirmed that he was the one throwing the beer cans. He dropped another two cans of 16oz Hollandia with same brown plastic bag as the ones that were there before.

I live in a townhome, so we’re pretty close in distance to neighbors. This one in particular was 10 houses down, a super quick 2 minute walk. I took the bag with beer he just threw away and walked on over. 

I knocked on the door and a sweet old lady opened, I asked nicely if the man of the house was home. She closed the door and went to fetch him. When he came to the door, dude noticed the bag with the beer cans in my hand and couldn’t even look me in the eye. I didn’t  get in his face, but I did let him know that I know it’s him using our carts and that it’s not cool. And that if he doesn’t stop, I will report to our HOA.

He just nodded and closed the door, didn’t even offer to take the trash to throw away. Then I heard a woman from behind the door asking him she wanted to talk to me, but he was telling her not to worry. But she pushed through and right away I knew it was his wife/girlfriend. She asked me what the issue had been. I told her I didn’t want any problems really, but that I didn’t appreciate our cart being used for other people’s trash. 

At that moment she apologized and asked if he had thrown away beers in our cart. I just showed her the bag with the Hollandia and she offered to take it to throw away. She was very apologetic and embarrassed about the whole thing. I let her know I appreciated her apology and bid her a good day. She went inside, and I heard her start yelling from the top of her lungs and threw the beer cans hard on the floor. She really started to chew him out, I just left because that’s none of my business.

But I couldn’t help feel a little guilty about possibly getting him in big time trouble and that me confronting him about throwing the beer cans away may have caused that family to have a bad day/week/life. The way she asked me about him throwing away the beers, the amount of beers he threw away in the span of three days, and how he was using a neighbors cart to dispose of his trash before getting home makes me believe he might be an alcoholic.

Not sure if I’m off base on my assumption, or on feeling guilty about the result of the incident. Just wanted my recycling cart to be left in peace and not pick up other people’s trash. Sorry for the long story, hope this belongs here.",32

2021-03-28 18:03:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/mfb46c/do_i_need_aa/,Do I need AA?,"Hi there, I'm new here so sorry if any of this is tactless. I recently heard someone say ""people who aren't addicts don't have to wonder if they are addicts"" and that made a lot of sense to me, but having spent most of my childhood and adult life in mentally abusive households, I am constantly second-guessing myself.  

To the problem. I'm in my mid 30s and have never had an issue with Alcohol. I drank pretty heavily in my late teens but stopped completely when my first child was born. Now 15 years later, I am going through a divorce, two custody battles, a move, and now a new job. Since I am was my own for the first time, I decided there would be no harm in having a beer or a shot or two at night.  

That started in mid 2020, and in the last few months it has progressed to a place that scares me. On a few occasions I have ""blacked out"" and had to be told afterward by my kids or my friends what I got up to. Luckily it turns out I just get super sentimental and fall alot, and didn't do any harm to anybody. My kids brushed it off and said it was just ""kinda funny"" but I grew up with an addict of a different kind, and I never wanted my kids to have to deal with that. 

I don't feel like I ""need"" alcohol, but I clearly cannot control how much I drink when I have it, and with all of the aforementioned stressors going on right now, I have given myself ample excuses to ""just have one"". This usually works for a while, but there was an incident last week where some friends came over and I ended up drinking until the early hours of the morning and missed waking up in time for my brand new job. 

My boss wasn't too concerned but, as with the kids, I broke one of my core values because I couldn't stop once I started. I'm 3 days clean so far and have no intention of picking up a bottle, but I don't want to go to AA. I have nothing but respect for those in recovery, but from the ex-alcoholics I've known or seen, the effort of NOT drinking for the rest of your life seems to take a huge amount of effort. I get visions of sweatily fingering my recovery coin anytime I see an ad for booze and having to wake up every morning and say the mantra that will keep me from drinking that day. Again, not trying to make fun, but thats more or less how its always been described to me. don't want the lack of alcohol to rule my life anymore than I want alcohol to.  

The problem is, as mentioned in the first part, I don't trust my own brain. I have smoked since 18 and I know full well how cleverly my own mind can ""logic"" its way into buying just one more pack. Am I lying to myself, or can I really reach a point where I can just not think about alcohol instead of always having to think about NOT using it?",2

I want to share a technique that might help some of us. I was following this idea without knowing that it is actually a research-backed technique.

The method is straightforward. The main idea is to **make it unsatisfying**. This will work well for short/medium-term goals.

1- Decide a duration that you want to stay away from drinking. - *1 month*

2- Commit money that makes you uncomfortable to lose. Make this amount visible to you. - *$500*

3- If you drink before your deadline, burn this money. Actually, burn it with a lighter. You've lost.

4- If you achieve your goal, take it back. Spend it to have fun.

Losing money (***making it unsatisfying***) motivates some people. There might be additional ways to practice this method on top of focusing on money. This is a framework that can help some people to control their alcohol consumption.

My opinion is that this technique is not the best fit for you if you want to get sober indefinitely. If you want to have additional control over your consumption, you can give it a try.

If you're interested in the technique, please comment or message me directly. I'd be happy to discuss how can we get better!",2

I vaped all the time, everywhere and for the last 2 1/2 months I have no motivation to do anything.   Clean, exercise, go to the store, shower its a struggle.  I am going through menopause so I do not know if it is from this or a combination of being sober, giving up vaping and menopause.  I need to get my butt off the couch and moving before I gain another 40lbs in a year.",108

My father (56 years) passed away on Monday, March 8th after being an alcoholic for 40 of those years. He was a caring, nurturing, intelligent human with the biggest, most tender heart and the best sense of humor. My dad was an artist, an activist, an educator, and the best father out there. He never meant to hurt anyone with his habit. He fathered 3 daughters, me being the middle one. He also had a step son who struggles with a drug addiction.

The point I’m trying to make is: my dad was a great guy. A light on this dark earth. He changed peoples lives by just saying the most simple things. He passed away last week trying to climb up a large hill to get to his house, tripped on a branch, and passed out from being drunk. After passing out, due to the extreme cold in northern Minnesota- he froze to death. I’ve spent a lot of time these last days contemplating what he must have felt and thought in his last moments. However, the reality is- dying from hypothermia, as tragic as it is, is pretty peaceful. He still didn’t deserve it, though.

If you are seeing this and struggle with something similar, I beg you to seek help. If you are seeing this, and you have a loved one struggling with an addiction, I encourage you to remain loving and gentle- educate yourself before you unload your burdens and anger onto them. Going through an AA meeting yourself may help. I am currently reading his AA journal, and it’s hard, but there is a lot of helpful insight about how he was feeling and what his triggers are. 

Seek out someone you trust, even if you haven’t spoken to them in years. Swallow your pride, don’t end up like my dad. Such a beautiful person who led an extraordinary life did not deserve to go like that. No one does. And remember, everyone is dealing with something, so always be kind. 

My dad wrote this poem when he went through a 90 day treatment program last year:

God is there
This whole time
I lived a lie to myself
I knew but I didn’t 
I loved but I didn’t 
I lived but I didn’t 
I was employed now I’m not
...
God is there I will find him.

My astounding discovery.,"Anxiety was killing me. Nothing helped except booze. But the next day the anxiety would be back with a vengeance. I have depression bad, ADD and anxiety. All the doctor would do is push more meds. Nothing helped. No AA, no group, nothing helped me. I finally decided something had to give. But what? What did the alcohol have in it to stop by my anxiety? It was heaven those 2-3 hours without worrying about everything. Depression lifted for 2-3 hours with a few drinks. What is it? What made my depression, my anxiety stop just for awhile, for a few blissful hours of relief with some drinks? So I looked for a cure. Read. Researched. And decided to think outside of the box. I decided to tackle the worst of my issues, the depression, with supplements. Started a stack of my choice: SAM-e, L-Tyrosine, 5-HTP and GABA. Washed down with a few beers. All uplifting and calming supplements. Started slow. 400 mgs. of Sam-e. With one of each of the others. No difference. Upped the supplement dosage, still had a few drinks, but I couldn’t get as happy with the alcohol. Odd, but I kept on taking the supplements.  Days of no change. But I read that it should work pretty quickly, days not weeks, and I could take up to 1600 mgs per day, so I went for it, adding until I hit 1600 mgs per day of Sam-e, 2-3 tablets of each of the others. And then it just stopped. The cravings. They were gone. I don’t know where they went but I could tell I didn’t need the alcohol to lift my spirits, calm my nerves and kill the anxiety any longer. I could say no to an offer of a cocktail with no effort. It did not do too much for the depression or the ADD, but anxiety? Yes. Anxiety went so far down that it was almost nonexistent. And with the anxiety almost gone, the need for alcohol left, too. It worked for me. Maybe? Just maybe? It could be helpful for you, too. If I slip up and forget to take them for a day or two, or I run out and don’t have more, I can feel the anxiety creeping back in.  And I know it won’t be long before I’ll need a drink to get away again. So I try very hard to stay with the regimen. And experiment with new supplements for other health issues. So far so good. Depression and ADD is lifting. Not like anxiety. I haven’t hit that perfect depression ADD stack yet but all we can do is work on getting better. Every day. But the cravings for alcohol? Under control. For the most part. 
Good luck to all. Hope this combination helps someone.",3
2021-03-16 22:53:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/m6qfzl/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?,"I am in my second semester of my senior year of college. I am trying to become a photojournalist.

I love helping people and giving a voice to those who need to amplify it. For some reason though, i need to lose control of my mind at the end of the day to feel ok. 

I smoke a lot of weed, but in the last month ive found myself drinking to what I worry is an excessive degree. I can now polish a 6-pack in an hour and still be able to walk straight, finger to nose and I feel like (i never actually do) I can drive. I drink daily.

I had been drinking alone for a little while now, but this past month the cat that had helped me through my darkest moment randomly and rapidly died. I know I shouldnt make excuses but I feel my ties to my family/home are gone and that I’ll be alone in two months.

I drink daily now. I need to not use my mind. I hate it but idk what to do. I wanna find love, make someone happy, help others, etc but I can’t function without being somewhat inebriated.

My parents had me drinking at a young age. I first tried scotch when i was 4, the first beer I drank and first time I was buzzed was 11, first time drunk and blackout was 14. My parents have asked me to crack open a beer so they weren’t drinking alone this past year. My parents are not by any stretch bad people, frankly I think they are as confused as me. Either way though, alcohol has always been part of my life.

Im not proud of happy with myself. I try to do as much as I can but I will always feel like a failure. I randomly turnwd out to be highly skilled at photography and have been using that to get money and advance myself but I worry I simply hot lucky. I shouldn’t need to but I feel as if alcohol helps me cover, at least temporarily, the sadness I have had for most of my life.

I do go to therapy and get hell but idk. Everything changes around me for the better, but I seem to stay the same or worse.",2

My boyfriend also had a drinking problem though and feels uncomfortable with my storing alcohol in our fridge at all. Does anyone else whose recovered from addiction feel the need to always have it in the fridge? It’s causing me to feel unsettled because the thought of not having any on hand makes me go into a panic. I want to accommodate my boyfriend though so that he doesn’t feel triggered or uneasy about it. Not sure what to do or if this is normal.",4

After three days (just now), I went to the store to get some cat food, forgot my wallet and turned around and when I pulled in the driveway he was slugging vodka. As always, he turned the entire issue on me, told me he was under emotional stress etc., and typical alcoholic bullying, screaming, defending, stinking, blaming.

I’ve seen heroin, cocaine, speed addicts. I’m no angel. Those drugs look weak compared to this. Literally I have never seen such an insidious disease.

What in the fucking world is rock bottom for someone like this? I have to back off I know. It’s starting to kill me.

Lockdown suprisingly helped because i was at home with my parents and my younger brother and I couldn't drink. Normally I live in another city where I study so I drank whenever I wanted. Seldom have I experienced any serious blackouts. That surely delayed my understanding that I am an fairly obvious alcoholic. When high school finished, my friends list decreased dramatically. That fact made me go out by myself for walks almost every day for that summer while telling my parents that I was going out with company. I was VERY bored. And suddenly beer showed up. I loved that feeling of being buzzed. I could do anything. I did some minor bad things. When I moved out I wasn't at that stage that I woke up thinking of drinking. But the first semester I experienced some major social failiures. I couldn't talk to anyone, I was very shy. And because I was a stupid kid thinking I was smart I stopped going to the university. I stayed at home, staring at my laptop and eating all day. I didn't tell my parents anything. As you can imagine, soon the bordness came back. So I thought to myself: ""Why not buy some beers?"". And that seeled the deal. I spent almost two years of my life seating at home eating a lot and drinking even more. As a result, I hadn't passed a single class in 4 semesters. I always said to myself ""Next semester you are gonna stop and study the sh*t out of these classes"". That obviously would never happen  And then lockdown happened. I returned home with very few classes passed and many unpaid bills because I spent the money on alcohol and food. My parents thought I had passed them all. And they didn't have a single idea about my huge money deficit or my alcohol problem. During spring of 2020 I didn't drink a single drop. I couldn't and I didn't want either. But my stress levels have gone through the roof. During summer the stores opened and the covid cases were few so I went out with the boys. Then someone suggested we go for beers. When the first drop touched my mouth I knew I was DEEP into the sh*thole once again. During that summer almost every single night I went out by myself (seldom with some friends) and drank a lot. Well, the day came when my parents found out about everything. August 12. A lot of shouting happened. But I felt happy inside because I knew that the hellhole that I was in was over. I spent the last semester studying all day, every day. I liked it. I liked that my life was starting to get organized. But unfortunetely, last week I relapsed. It was the immence stress I felt during the exams. I know what you think. ""You had it coming"". Well I did, but that time I spent by myself wasn't nice. It was full of stess, misery and depression. Anyway, my mother caught me. When I saw that look on her eyes I felt my soul crash and burn. They are giving it their all and I throw it all away? At that point I drew the line. The desicion was made. NO MORE ALCOHOL FOR ME. I visit this subreddit from time to time to watch what other people's experiences are with that kind of stuff. But today I decided to join and make my first post to say: WE CAN DO THIS LADS. There are times when that craving is umbearable. But I believe in us. We're gonna do this fellas.

I never hit rock bottom. In fact, I'm doing extremely well. I own a house. I have a beautiful wife. I have two cadillacs in the garage and a miata I drive in the summer for fun. I make six figures a year and everyone at work loves me and thinks I'm doing an amazing job. I have a lot of friends. I don't need to hide my drinking from anyone. I work 9-5 and then drink in the evenings. My last two promotions came because I was drunk and sent off an email one night feeling confident, and it actually paid off. I've landed clients over drinks worth millions for my company. If you looked at it from the outside, drinking has been nothing but good for me.

But I have a problem. A drinking problem.

Everything I listed above is 100% IN SPITE OF me drinking. While I've been resting on my laurels and thinking that I'm doing well because I was drinking, I've finally realized that what got me here, will not get me to my goals.

My house I own? It's fine, but it's not in a city I want to live in and it's smaller than what I dreamed of, because I've been too drunk every night to look for a better future.

My wife? I'm now 130 pounds heavier than her and people always comment ""you're outkicking you coverage!"" when they see a picture of us. People are shocked when they see her after knowing me, because she's taken care of herself and I've completely let myself go. She's stood by me 100% of the time and I have her support, but I can't help but feel shitty every day that she met me at 180 lbs, married me at 200 lbs, and now I'm 260 lbs.

My cars are fun, but I almost never get the chance to enjoy them because every weekend I wake up either still drunk, hungover, or I get drunk an hour or two after waking up. They just sit in my garage.

I make six figures sure, but I could be making 200 or 250k by now. After selling my company 6 years ago, I've gotten drunk every day after work and have never in those 6 years have even tried to look for another job. I can coast at my job, I can show up hungover, it's easy to drink every night and do my job. But in 6 fucking years, I could have been 3 jobs deeper in my life and at the pinnacle of my career. But no, I'm still here, still doing the same job, still not moving ahead.

Everyone at work will say I'm doing an amazing job, but that's because my standards are so low. No one has seen what I can do when I'm sober for a long period of time. No one knows the ""real"" me. I haven't gone more than a week without drinking since I started the job. I've drank at least 60 drinks every week since I started, except for maybe one or two when I ""tried to quit.""

The good news, I do have friends. I let them know I'm not drinking anymore and they are actually supportive! We can kick it and just watch a basketball game, play video games, or listen to music and I'm sure it's fucking hard for them, but they don't show it. Thank god for that.

And just because you don't need to hide your drinking, doesn't mean it's not a problem. Just because you don't get blasted at 2:00pm doesn't mean it's not a problem. The years of career progression. The abandonment of my hobbies. The total lack of health -- eating like shit, not exercising, just sitting around drinking all night and all weekend... the end results of those you can't hide. I've been here for 6 years, I'm fat as fuck, and I have anxiety like you couldn't believe. I have horrible psoriasis. My doctor told me I have early signs of fatty liver. I'm ashamed of myself and I realized it's not the drinking you have to hide... it's looking at your fat face on zoom all day. You can't hide that, but you should. I deserve better than staring a dude who doesn't even have a neck anymore all day on zoom.

And imagine blaming asking for a raise on booze. Sure I had the confidence to do that on Alcohol, but only because I was too ashamed of my poor performance to do it sober. If I had been sober the whole time I would have worked harder, moved on to a better situation, and advanced in my career, instead of getting a shitty 10% raise every couple years. Pathetic.

For every client I've landed over drinks, there's another two I probably embarrassed myself over. I envy my co-workers who can have a couple drinks and be fine. That's just not me. I'm the kind of guy who looks at how much wine everyone gets poured at the table and works to finish my glass first so I can claim the extras in the bottle. I'm not listening to anyone at the table. I'm only worried about the next drink, as soon as I have my first drink.

I've been living the lie for the last 10 years that drinking was good for me. I've been brainwashed (yes I read Allen Carr's book and that's what inspired the change), and I'm done with drinking. It will eventually bring me to a real rock bottom, and I need to take control of my life now, while I'm still relatively on top, and reach my true potential.

From here on out it's one day at a time, and I will not drink with you today my friends.

I however cannot go to the psychiatrist tommorow, but it's urgent to stop, so can I take half pills of prazepam (lysanxia) to not be anxious and risk a seizure?

When should I decide to take a pill? It has a long half life time. I might have to call my psychiatrist but I'm too ashamed, and I don't want to visit her again. My biggest fear is having a seizure spontaneously, does that happen? Or are there gradual symptoms of sweat shivering etc before the seizure?

When I took antidepressants she told me to take one pill when I was really too anxious for it to be manageable. Should I just do that once and if I am too anxious?",7

I've been a regular drinker for 30 years.  I am a 47 year old male.  The volume and intensity of drinking has varied through those years.  The past 10 years have definitely escalated to primarily hard alcohol (mostly vodka), supplemented with high alcohol IPA's.

A week before Christmas, I was coming off a week long bender of drinking all day every day.  When I stopped drinking, as I began my work week the next day, I experienced debilitating anxiety (I do suffer from GAD). I felt like I was surely going to die.  I was experiencing a high heart rate, uncontrollable shaking, and feelings of doom.  I ended up in the hospital for 3 days.  All tests were normal other than the standard low electrolytes and dehydration.  Received fluids and anti anxiety meds.

I stopped drinking for a few weeks and relapsed.  EXACT same thing happened.  Although it was much less alcohol consumed.  I resisted the urge to go to the hospital.  So, You'd think I learned my lesson.  Nope.  3 weeks ago I binged and drank the better part of a bottle of tequila.  Horrible consequences.  The anxiety was sooooo bad the next day! 

I guess I'm done with alcohol.  Haven't had any since.  Question is...  I wish I knew why my body and mind suddenly decided to react this way from alcohol?  Im glad because alcohol has had a significant negative impact on my life and I have been always looking for a reason to quit....  No its time to face the demons!  LOL",1

While that’s great, there’s also a terrifying truth there— I have sooo much drinking experience and know way to much about how to pace myself and how each type of drink makes me feel, that this hasn’t happened in so long. I’m no longer oblivious to alcohol’s effects, which is a danger in itself. I never puke anymore and I’m rarely hungover, yet I drink so much more now than I used to. I joke about it because many of my loved ones don’t even recognize it as an issue, but I definitely know it is one for me. I’m drunk very frequently. I’m just incredibly “functional” at the right amount of tipsy. I am starting help for my alc abuse tmrw, and I am scared.

I literally can have like 1-2 5% beers and then become a lot less social and it is hard to think of what to say. I often will then want to go home and get more drunk except by myself. I think this is very uncommon, and I can’t find anything about this online! All I can find is stuff about why it makes you more social! I think part of it might be because I’ve smoked weed every single day for longer than I’ve drank alcohol. Except, I do very well socially while high. (Unlike many people!!) My other idea, is that since my dad is an alcoholic, maybe it runs in my genes to just want to habitually consume alcohol in solitude?!

Hi, I posted on Al-anon also, but I'm trying to get more insight. Also, english is not my native language so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. If anyone takes time to read it I would be very grateful.

I (F28) don't know if my partner (M30) is an alcoholic. I'm not sure if I am being overly dramatic, paranoid or even abusive, or if he is really having a problem. I don't know what is going on, who is in denial here, because i have a difficult time processing these informations and I don't have experience with alcoholism. So I will try to explain.

I live with my partner for 5 years (6 together) and his relationship with alcohol has been an issue few times in our relationship, we had a huge fight about it maybe three or four times. It would become a focus for a week or two and then it would just stop being a problem, or other things would be in focus. ( i now feel kind of stupid writing this)

He works as a bartender. The first time my alarm bell went up was one year into a relationship, I was in another city during the summer and he sent me a photo of him, watching a movie alone and enjoying a whiskey or something like that. His intention was to show me he was having a relaxing evening, but to me, it made me angry and I started a fight. I dont remember how it went after that, but I got angry because both of his parents were alcoholics, he spent his childhood in a foster home and has a lot of other problems so it scares me. Also, he had a lot of denial about his mother being alcoholic, even though i found a court decision regarding neglect of children and alcoholism was clearly named and described as a mayor component of her behaviour (I never met her). I don't remember how we resolved that, he probably said that he wouldn't drink alone if it bothers me.

Next time we had a fight about alcohol was when I realised that he would drink a beer or two every day during his shift at the club, and would drink more during the weekend, because clients would buy him drinks. I dont acctually know if it was every day, if it was only beer or not. I didn't notice any difference in behaviour, any smell or anything during the week, only on weekends when he would come home, i would smell it in his breath. It was more my ""gut"" and logic that pushed me to ask how much does he drink on his work. He said that he sometimes has one beer that he sips during the evening or with lunch, and that he drinks three or four drinks on a weekend.

He didn't see a problem with that, he said that he likes the taste of a beer and that during the weekend it is more fun and manageable to handle the loud music and the people, but that he definitely can go without a drink, and that he does not feel compelled to drink.

For me, it was obviously a big problem, I said that he works as a bartender for years now and for years to come, and that even if he is not addicted yet, he is almost certain to become an acloholic if he contnues to drink on his work. At home, we wouldn't drink often, a glass of wine or a beer with dinner maybe once a week, or with friends, but that time he decided that he wouldnt drink at all, even with friends or nights out to show me that he doesn't have a problem. And that lasted for a month or so, maybe more, maybe less but slowly he started to drink a glass of wine on dinner once a week or twice, a beer or two on a night out. We didn't discuss it really, because it just didn't seem like a problem. We had bottles of alcohol in the fridge that would just sit there for months.

Alcohol became a topic again maybe a year later. During the winter we would spend a lot of time together and I believe that we drank quite rarely, we wouldn't go out much and he did a different job during the winter. But then the summer would come, and he works for a beach club during the summer season (three months a year), while I stay in our home city and visit him for three weeks. During that visit I noticed that he was coming from work buzzed. He said he would drink a drink or two to cool down on his break or relax after work. That started fights again, but my focus was more on the fact that he seemed uninteressted in me, and has been flirting with some girls, and having a lot of fun at work. For me at that time, him drinking was a part of having entering that world of a big beach club, dancers, tourists... We had huge fights and probably should have broken up, but those fights were about other girls, him lying, having fun at work and staying late. It was really awful, but to me it wasn't related to alcohol or alcoholism. When he came back from the season, the drinking stopped and went back to normal.

During the next two summer seasons we would fight but again it wasn't exactly about the alcohol, it was Football World Cup so he drank a lot during the mathes and celebrations after the wins and we fought because he didnt answer my call once during one of those evenings and once he got so drunk so he decided to sleep in the club where he works. Still, it was more my concern about infidelity and spending money than alcoholism. During the rest of the year things were fine, we very rarely drank at home, he doesn't really go out and he rarely hangs out with collegues.

That brings me to yesterday! So, yesterday my family visited and my father wanted a drink. I told him to find something in the fridge, and he pulled out a Rum bottle that was half full. He poured it in hte glass but when he tried it it was water. So, i asked my partner why there was water in the bottle instead of rum and he kind of got scared and told me that he filled it with water to have it cold. After my parents went home, I confronted him, and asked him what happened with the rum that was in it and he said that for the past month or so, he would pour himself a drink while washing the dishes. I freaked out. He was drinking in secret in the kitchen. I don+t believe that he filled the btlle to have cold water, i think he did it to hide that he was drinking, knowing that i dont like anything but wine so I wouldn't notice. He is not a trustworthy person in general, so I am not sure if it happened only for the last month or if it was the only bottle. We had some wine, gin and whiskey in the fridge for a very long time and those were intact, but I dont know if there was anything else. We had a huge fight, i threw away all alcohol that we had, including one drink that he saved for a year for a special occasion.

He said that I am overreacting, that he can do whatever he likes, that he drank because he liked the taste and not because he has to.

When I confronted him with the fact that he liked it so much that he was hiding it from me and ready he admitted that that was wierd but he was also angry that I was pushing him. I finally said that I believe that he is an alcoholic and that I will say what happened to my familly because I don't want to live in shame and in a secret because of him, when he doesen't even want to admit that he has a problem. At that point he said ok, that he IS an alcoholic, that he understands that that was not normal, he doesn't know why he drank in secret, just not to say anything to my family. He also said that he still doesnt feel like an alcoholic because he doesn't need a drink.

I dont know what to think. I never noticed anything. EVen if it was just during this last month. Not a slightest change in behaviour, mood, smell... notihing. I am wondering if this was gooing on during our entire relationship. Was he always drunk? But we spent months during this lockdown, isolated and together, I never noticed a new bottle, sometimes we woulden't go out for days. I don't know what to think.

For the last two months we were sleepenig separately. I had an abortion three months ago and that hit us both very hard, he blames himself. Could that be the reason that he is drinking?

Does any of this sound familliiar to you? I dont know if a I'm blind and he has been a alcoholic for this whole time. At the same time, we spent few months this year isolated with my familly, going on hikes, excercising, I cant imagine that noone would notice. But than again, if he has been drinking for tha past moth, I never noticed anything.

I am sorry for such a long post. I would be very grateful for any insight",0
2021-03-14 14:49:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/m519q1/two_weeks_for_me_today_my_tale_of_withdrawal/,Two weeks for me today - my tale of withdrawal,"So, I've been a heavy drinker for just over 13 years. I didn't start out drinking heavily but was drinking every night. The amount kept increasing until I was drinking just over 750ml of brandy every night, sometimes mixed with half a bottle of wine. In other words I don't remember going to bed for a while.

Two weeks ago I decided to quit cold turkey. For anyone out there thinking of quitting, I will say to expect the first week to be really tough. There is no easy path - you just have to endure and push through. The first day was really bad. I felt nauseous, I couldn't eat anything, and my hands were shaking so bad I couldn't even get a cup of water up to my mouth without spilling it. I spent hours just laying on the bathroom floor waiting to throw up. I had horrible sweats. I had to keep a bunch of paper towels next to me and I could soak a paper towel with sweat in a few minutes. Night sweats were really bad, especially since I didn't sleep for about a week. The first three days I got zero sleep. My heart would race, my mind would race, and I'd lay there staring at the ceiling all night. I had a couple nights where I had really bad hypnic jerks, so bad I would literally jerk myself several inches above the mattress. Several times I had the thought that I was dying. One struggle was trying to get myself hydrated. I was extremely dehydrated. I had to force myself to drink lots of water and I mixed in Gatorade as well.

This second week I think I'm past the withdrawal. My hands don't shake anymore, I have a good appetite and I'm starting to sleep again. Overall, I feel pretty good. Most of the anxiety I had while drinking is gone, my blood pressure is way down, and I'm in a better mood. Now, I just need to keep it going. I still have strong urges to drink, especially late evening. After about 8PM is when I would usually start drinking, and I have to admit, I do miss the buzz. I've talked to other recovering alcoholics and they say the urge lessens but never really goes away. I've come to accept that I'm ""different"" from people who can drink and then stop. I just have to accept that I can't drink any more. I've ""quit"" in the past and if I have one drink, it's a quick downward spiral to out of control drinking.

I know everyone has different experiences when quitting, so I thought I would share what I went through. Last week was hell and I don't want to go through that again. If anyone has any questions, just ask.

Edit: I wanted to add, I could not have done this alone. I hid my drinking for a long time from family and friends. Once I decided to quit, I also stopped hiding. I talked to family and friends and told them what was going on, even though it was incredibly humbling and embarrassing for me. Going through the rough week, I got a ton of support from my wife. She pretty much let me go through the withdrawal and picked up the slack with duties and the kids, and let me recover. I had talks with friends who I knew had problems with alcohol in the past, and my sister and brother. They were all incredibly supportive. The more people I talked to about my problem, the easier it got because I knew I had people who cared about me. I could not have done it alone. The point is, no matter how embarrassing it is, talk to those you have in your life. It will make the transition easier. And thanks for the ""Helpful"" award, kind Redditor! It means a lot. ;-)",16

I didn't think it would be forever but wanted to get through the second lockdown without drinking.

I've been romanticising wine a lot recently, and thinking that I wasn't THAT bad and generally just stressing out about if I should have a glass or not. Well the sheer boredom of another weekend stuck at home tipped me over the edge yesterday and I ended up drinking a bottle of wine. This time though I really thought about how it tasted, how it was making me feel and how it changed my behaviour.
 Firstly it tasted disgusting, like drinking acid. The first glass felt nice kind of chill but I quickly started feeling sloppy and sluggish and just not good. I  got a bad stomach for the 1st time since I stopped. I also realise that as soon as I started despite all the negatives I kept thinking just a little more won't hurt luckily I only njad 1 bottle orni could quite easily have kept going. 
Today I have a splitting headache and feel groggy and generally crap.

Although I should probably reset my clock I don't think of this as a relapse but rather a confirmation that taking a break was the right thing to do and it's certainly broken any positive feelings I have towards drinking. Im proud of how well I've done so far and it encourages me to keep going so I'm keeping my days. 

Obviously I'm not encouraging others to do this, I know everyones experience is different. I'm really just writing this down so I can revisit it if / when I feel like having another drink.

Stay strong everyone IWNDWYT",7

Also my spelling and grammar is atrocious to begin with, and even worse when I'm upset so I'm sorry. Also I know I could Google some of this, but I wanted opinions from real people who've had similar experiences.

Anyways, I'll get to the point. My mother is an alcoholic, and has been for almost 10 years now. She is also a narcissist, which makes it hard to offer help or even express our concern without her taking it as an attack.

There have been a lot of incidents because of it over the last 10 years, and almost every single time it eventually gets swept under the rug. But recently we experienced a loss in my family which has just made her spiral.

She's getting worse, if she's not at the worst she's ever been she's definitely close. She hides alcohol, sneaks it, and we suspect even drives drunk. Not just the tip of the iceberg. It's heavily affecting my family, especially my teenage brother who still lives with her. We're  concerned about her health and safety as well as the people around her.

I would like people's experience or advice on how to help her. To be very blunt I believe she needs counseling, or some kind of program that's going to make her get sober because she will not do it herself. She refuses counseling, and any other form of help. Nothing we've tried works because she just won't be part of it. As soon as it gets brought up she starts crying and accusing others and won't listen to anyone or take their suggestions or concerns seriously.

It's beyond frustrating because she's a grown woman and also my mother. I can't make her do anything she doesn't actively want to do. But it's gotten to a point where I feel like if we don't make her do it, she won't and it's just going to get worse. 

I want and try to be empathetic, but her alcoholism has caused so many issues for so many people and she pretends like that's all a lie. She's going to kill herself in one way or another if we can't figure out the how to help her, but I am at a complete loss.

How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped? How do you help someone who refuses to acknowledge that they have a problem? How do you help someone who is killing themselves, and tearing a rift in their family but can't even see it? 

And more importantly what do I not do? What's going to make it worse? I don't want to send her over the edge, I know it's an addiction and I don't want to make it worse or fuel the fire. I don't want her to feel attacked, I don't want her to hide more, I don't want her think we don't care. But I can't trust her to try to get better on her own because she has had so many chances and has never even tried.

This isn't the most well formatted or worded post, but I just need opinions. When I talk to my family about it some chastise, some want to baby her, and others just ignore it. I don't know what to do, I don't know what I can do. I'm at a loss.",3

To give you a backstory my best friend (20m) and I (19f) have been friends for almost 8 years, we are both basically part of eachother a families. In January of 2020 he lost his brother to a drug over dose in which he himself found the body. He has always drank a little too much but since the death of his brother he drinks everyday (shots of hard liquor) to cope and also as a way for him to build confidence to make videos (in which he has a  large following) which has created a dynamic where he needs to drink to be the person people want him to be. the bigger problem is that his mother is an alcoholic as well. They both have an incredibly toxic relationship and are abusive towards each other when they drink, however, since they are both addicts they enable one another and keep doing it. I am ashamed to admit that when I go over to his place I end up drinking with him, I know that’s the last thing I should be doing but he just starts drinking and I feel it’s the only way to stop him from finishing a bottle to himself and I can’t stand to see him blackout again as it hurts too much to see him loose himself. He has a tendency to cut people out of his life and I am afraid if I talk to him about his problem and tell him that I won’t drink with him again he will slowly cut me off. I am all he has I was the only one with him during the loss of his brother and I’m the only one not using him for “clout”. He has admitted he is an alcoholic but doesn’t stop. I am slowly loosing the person I once knew and I know there’s nothing anyone can do to help but some advice would be amazing because I am so lost. Thank you. Please do not post this anywhere else.",3

Hi Guys,  
 

I wanted to share here because it is possible. No matter how deep it feels you’re in it, there is a way out if you want it. I want to remember this anniversary date by sharing how this all started and where I was. I want to focus on this because it is one of the hardest places that I believe a person can be in. 

My hope is that in sharing it, someone can draw from my life experience and if this helps only one person, then the years have been worth it.

By March 12, 2013 I was freshly 22 years old. I had been kicked out of one of the best colleges in the world and stepped down to a lesser one, I had to return home hat in hand. My liver was failing, my health deteriorating from drinking over a fifth of hard liquor a day.

I had reached the point where in the last weeks of drinking, my tolerance for alcohol had plummeted to a few shots only. Those who are familiar with the Jelinek Curve can see that it is a stage you really do not want to be in.

By then I had already tried unsuccessfully to quit drinking for a few months, but nothing worked.

My breaking point, or should I say, the point where I realized enough was enough…. I was sitting in class around 530 pm and I pulled out my phone and googled 12 step meetings. Right then and there. Saw there was a meeting at 630 a few miles away.

In a break in the class, I went up to the professor and said: “Sir, something came up, can I take leave early?” I remember it crystal clear he responded jokingly: “Is it a matter a life and death?” I stayed quiet for about 5 seconds and looked back at him somberly and said: “Yes Sir, it is.” He gave me leave.

I left school and headed to that meeting. Been sober ever since.

I have graduated college, started a business, started a family, lived through the death of my mother, changed residences and states, changed workplaces, lived through deaths of friends and people I love, gained friends and lost friends. All of the above, sober and without a single drink. It IS possible, just go for it as if your life depends on it and as if it were a matter of life and death, because as I said eight years ago… “Yes sir, it is.”",107

Of course I google it because I know I drink far too much, for far too long and convinced myself it’s something else. Ascites?  Cirrhosis? Maybe.  Or a gas bubble that just likes to linger and make me look 6 months pregnant?

I’ve heavily drank for the better part of 13 years.  Not an all day drinker, but every evening, averaging about 8 high alcohol 12 oz beverages. Sometime more, sometimes less.  Rarely not at all.  I have had some minor pain where my liver is.  But of course, convinced myself I have time to turn it around.  And then continued.  I’m 35, btw. 

Well, 2 days ago I had the abdominal pangs and bloating and gasX isn’t helping. But after researching it, I’m convinced my liver is failing me (or rather, I failed it).  Maybe I’m looking too far into it but it definitely got my head out of my ass.  I’ll be scheduling an appt. with my PCP tomorrow and am avidly sure I am done drinking.

I already know I have high blood pressure and cholesterol.  No swelling in my feet, ankles or legs. No jaundice. And no DT’s.  This stomach thing is freaking me out because the prognosis of what I read up on isn’t a good one.

Has anyone here ever experienced anything like this? Hopefully some positives came out of it you can share with me, to talk me off this ledge of “omg you are going to die in two months and leave your family “mom and wifeless”.

Thank you in advance and IWNDWYT!",8

Wife, mom of a 3 year old with another on the way. My sober journey began almost a year and a half ago. I had a night of drinking with one of my friends after I put my daughter to bed. We had split a bottle of wine, and I proceeded to drink a bottle and a half more. I had just begun a new job and as I drove my daughter to daycare the next, stat for an hour in traffic, and walked into my building I could feel myself sweating alcohol. I was grateful my boss wasn't in that day. I was miserable. I was ashamed. I texted my husband and told him that I couldn't do this drinking thing anymore, and despite the struggles I've been sober ever since. I found my sober community and begun collecting tools for my sober tool box. I began having honest conversations about my alcohol consumption with my loved ones. I even lost a few friends because of it. 

My addiction snuck up on me. I drank in college because I thought it was cool. My mom died a couple years after I graduated and I used it to cope. By the time I had quit 8 years later I started lying about how much I was drinking, making note of all the places I could get wine or beer on my way home from work, lying to myself because though I liked ""the sauce,"" I showed no outward signs of a problem that kept getting worse. I feel bad saying I didn't quit for my husband or kid, but when I did I was frankly over my own bullshit and that was the surrender I needed. I will never forget that moment because it felt like I had come dangerously close to falling off a cliff and stopping myself just in a knick of time. It's a weird mix of fear and relief.  


Last night, my husband who is a singer had a couple of his chorus buddies over who are in our covid bubble. Two of the guys carpooled together and the passenger of the carpool was sloppy drunk when he was picked up. This isn't to shame him by any means. As my husband's buddy, I love him dearly and we've had conversations about struggling with alcohol addiction. I noticed when he arrived, my daughter who normally loves him hid behind my legs and wouldn't go near or make eye contact with him. It got me thinking about how things could have been if I still drank. It also got me thinking about how I could possibly help him. (I suggested to my husband no drinking at the house if the guys come over and he was completely on board with that.) 

I know why he drinks, I know he's self medicating and I've watched in the past several years since he ended his 10 year sobriety stretch how it's gotten progressively worse for him and I know that when you're there, only you can wake yourself up. I wish I could help but I don't know how.   


Anyway, thank you for reading and listening.",27

I roughly have 2 bottles of whiskey a week along with beers/ciders/cocktails ect

Is this healthy? i know its not particularly a lot but I worry as I have to drink every night. I suffer with depression, anxiety, struggling to sleep and this appears to be a good coping mechanism at the moment.

Another one of my worries is I have put on a lot of weight recently which I can only put down to the alcohol.

I'm not sure what to do at the moment, if this isn't bad then I'm more than happy to keep as I am, but if it's the opposite I don't know if it is possible to cut down.

I have attempted to cut down several times and written in a diary my alcohol consumption as I use to black out a lot.

Any advice and comments would be great, thanks in advance.",3

If alcohol is the only way to be content, happy, and functioning from a mental standpoint, how could I live like this every day and still be in shape...(Used to be easy now it's really hard.) I have drank heavily for the past two years of really sugary, high alcohol volume, liquor...

Also  I have realized no matter what medication, no matter how many weeks i abstain, no matter how many AA meetings, From a mental standpoint, I feel absolutely Miserable and very uncomfortable every single day of my life...

Even before drinking was a habit....Life was never comfortable. Just constant mental suffering..(anxiety, depression, depersonalization, paranoia, inconsistent moods and really awkward encounters with people)

Now, I full well realize that his recovery is his responsibility and his journey, but when he gets there should I encourage him to go in for a medical detox or just to call the doctor?

I’m a 21 year old college senior and I can tell I’m on the road to a serious problem re: alcohol use (if I’m not there already). After a few friends confronted me about my drinking, I began thinking about why I drink, and it seems largely due to emotional release. I feel like I can’t cry or really sit with my sadness until I’m extremely intoxicated.

Now that I’ve realized that of course I understand that it’s bad, but I don’t really know what my next steps should be, so any advice would be much appreciated. I feel like if I don’t get this under control soon, I could end up with a full addiction, and obviously that’s something I’d like to avoid. I’m on Lexapro already and I see a therapist regularly, but I haven’t told her about this yet because my drinking had been getting better for a while and I don’t want her to be disappointed in me (I know this is flawed logic so feel free to call me out).

It got to the point where I blacked out every single night and didn’t remember a single detail from the night the morning after. 

Eventually my family/SO caught on and have tried to help me several times. This past intervention was just different though, I don’t know how else to describe it. I’m so embarrassed with myself. I’m too old and I’m too young (22F) to be dealing with this if that makes any sense. 

I got put on medication to help with the withdrawals. I was seeing/hearing stuff that wasn’t there, excessively sweating, nauseous, shakey, among other things. I still cannot sleep at ALL but hopefully that’ll change soon.

I've started noticing little things happening out the corner of my eye. Shapes, non-existent bugs, objects moving. It's ten million times worse when completely drunk but I was kinda chillin with the fact that I'm just crazy.

But this morning I woke up with one of my worst hangovers, went to the bathroom and swear to God it looked like someone *jumped out of the shower* behind me, ready to attack. I HEARD the sound of it too. I nearly jumped out of my freaking skin at something that wasn't even there. I froze for like ten minutes and then thoroughly inspected everything to make sure I was really alone.

In conclusion, I locked my alcohol in a chest and tossed the key behind my bed where it'd be a hassle to look for. 

I can't keep existing like this, it wasn't bothering me at first but the next imaginary thing to jump out might make me do something stupid.


Edit: ahh you guys are scaring me with your replies. I hadn't realized this was probably a side effect of withdrawal and that it can get even worse. I'm going to try and get help this week.

This is my first serious relapsing as an alcoholic and I live in a country where I can not afford the medical care. I have to fly back to my home country to get help from professionals 

I used to drink a lot and it has been 3 years since. Now In March I started again, and somehow ended up drinking large quantities of strong alcohol straight away, because of old habits.

My question is... does anyone have experience with flying when in cycle of drinking?  are there any adverse effects?",3

He had a pill problem back in high school that he’s since recovered from so he’s no stranger to addiction but he was able to kick it. However, last January, his mom passed suddenly (he’s just now turning 23) and it shook him to his core and tore his life apart. Since then he’s been steadily increasing how much he drinks and it’s starting to spill over into the work day. He was trashed before noon on the clock today. 

I took him aside once I noticed and we had a long conversation about how he’s feeling and why he’s doing this. Obviously the death of his mother did a number on his mental health and drinking is the only thing that makes him feel “normal” anymore. I want to help him, I love him dearly, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to reach through to him and prove to him that people care about him, that drinking is just a band aid for the pain and won’t fix the underlying cause of his pain.

Anytime I bring up quitting he just circles back to how he needs it, how the withdrawals outweigh the damage of drinking, how it’s this or pills. He’s a good man, he deserves better than the lot he’s drawn and I know that slipping deeper into alcoholism is only going to make things worse for him but I don’t know how to help, I don’t know how to get through to him. If anyone has any advice or anything I would very, very much appreciate your insight.",3

My sister has been an alcoholic for over ten years. She went to the hospital almost two years ago because her liver was failing and they thought she would need a transplant. FF to july of last year.. she was doing great and had been sober for at least half a year. Then she filed for divorce. A major reason she started drinking was because of him. Since the divorce she’s been relapsing. She was staying with my parents until two weeks ago when she moved out and got her own place. I went to visit and she’s super weak, makes up stories.. basically hallucinates, and has no remorse or feelings. She’s still drinking.. I literally saw her drink vodka while I was there. I think she’s going to suffer from failed organs. Her behavior was not normal. My parents and I are having a hard time with not being able to do anything. She’s been to AA, She tried inpatient for a few days, we’ve been to Al Anon, but she’s 36 so I’m not sure how much more we can do. Any advice?",2

Some ""memorable"" blackouts:

\- The first one I ""remember"": after driving home from my college in 2007 for a childhood friend's party, waking up IN MY CAR with my keys and vomit all over my shirt the next day, bloodied knuckles, and embarrassing notifications that I punched a hole in the wall and tried to fight the cops 

\- The day I came to, so clueless as to the previous night's events, that I somehow figured out (ingeniously I thought) I could use Google Maps' timeline feature to track my moves; it was effective and unfortunately, I still use it today

\- That time the hangover was so bad, and the missed calls and texts so numerous, that, respectively, I checked myself into the nearby emergency room for fluids, and selfishly deleted - without looking - every incoming communication I'd received over the last few hours that I was too horrified to read

\- Partying, drinking, and blacking out before fellow classmates

\- *Studying*, drinking, and blacking out before fellow classmates

\- Many makeout sessions, don't ask me who

\- A few random hookups...don't ask me who

\- Much too many Tinder dates I don't remember

\- More seemingly-unjustified ""You're not allowed in this establishment anymore""s than I can remember

\- Far too many details of important conversations with family, friends, and significant others that **I just don't remember** because **I just don't remember** having those conversations

\- Waking up in my bed; I'd made it home without losing my keys

\- Waking up with my car keys in my bed; I'd driven home drunk

\- Upstate, starting at a wine bar and ending up alone in a random church watching a Christmas play in the back pew

\- Upstate, starting at a tequila bar to celebrate a new job offer and snapping out of it in a woman's house, standing before her as she clutched her child begging me to leave

\- Downtown, coming to on my friend's couch with bloody knuckles and a deep gash on my palm - according to a friend I tried to talk to some guy's girlfriend, got into it with him, then got my ass beat by the bouncer and thrown out of the bar - Jazzy Jeff of Fresh Prince style - landing on my hands in broken glass. That explained the gash

\- Downtown, that same friend telling me two days later that after the bouncer/fight incident, I tried to pee on the television set in our mutual friend's apartment before he stopped me

\- Coming to in the back of a taxi cab following a concert, only to realize we were stopped on the side of the road awaiting the police. According to the driver's remarks to them, I'd threatened him with violence; I was lucky in that the cops only put me in the back of the car and escorted me (a Black man) back to the arena

\- Waking up in an Airbnb in California - sand on the bed, an unopened condom, and a woman's hoop earring lying next to me. Did we or didn't we?

\- Waking up in an Airbnb in New York, hungover, but showering like all is normal, coming out and seeing a push notification from Airbnb that I had moments to vacate the property due to "" an incident involving law enforcement"" the night before. Horrified, I begrudgingly read the next alert from my female host letting me know she'd left and was staying with a friend, awaiting my departure because - understandably - she felt unsafe. In a panic, I packed, rushed, hurried down the stairs and to the porch where I was met by the neighbor. ""Hey man are you OK?""  ""Huh?"" ""Yeah last night you were pretty out of it, bro. You were banging on my door trying to come in, left, fell asleep on my porch, cops came but your friend (my host who I'd only just met) vouched for you. I actually called the cops on you but asked them not to pursue charges after you left.""  I mustered out a sheepish ""thank you"" and got outta dodge

\- Coming to on the balcony of a large home in the suburbs near my city. It's dark - inside and out. Completely out of it but with sense enough to decide I should get the hell out before trying to figure out where the hell I was, I looked over the balcony - just enough to trigger the backyard light. Shit. OK, so scaling down the side into the backyard and over the fence into the woods is out (if I'm being honest with myself, I was never going to do that). I turned around to see that the door to the home was slightly open. **The door to the private home where people lived**. Were they asleep? Did they know I was there? Sneaking in, I looked to my left and I looked to my right. The carpet was shaggy. The smell was musty. The whole thing was creepy. Somehow I managed to sneak my way down the steps, out the door, onto the driveway, and into the street, not before taking a picture of the home on my way out - a picture I still have today; the time stamp reads 4:16 AM. This was it. ""I have a serious problem,"" I thought. I could have ended up in jail or worse.

\- Waking up in jail. Body cam and security cam footage would later place me on the sidewalk, with four police officers on top of me (5'9"" 145lbs) telling me to stop resisting, before hauling me off to the station and booking me.

None of this is normal. I'll get into my drinking habits in other posts, but it became clear after another incident his weekend that I have a serious problem - and I'm careening towards catastrophe. For years I denied it: ""I'm a law student,"" ""I'm clean cut and work in a high level government position - I'm not a (stereotypical) drunk."" But all the while, increasingly relying on alcohol to deal with stress, hiding my drinking from others, and having so many blackouts that whole periods of time become unclear. Above is just a snapshot of some blackouts, others I didn't share for the sake of time, but again, this is not normal. Now I accept that. And to be sure, in a decade of denial after denial, I've been incredibly, if not unfairly lucky.  The pain and shame that comes with the inability to recount moments and conversations with loved ones, and, perhaps worse, finding out that you put yourself and others at risk of harm, after a while becomes too much to bare. Indeed, I am an alcoholic.

Thanks for letting me share.",105

2021-03-07 21:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/m05it7/onetime_drunken_violence/,One-Time Drunken Violence,"Hi this is my first post on this subreddit, and I was hoping to get some advice out of it. 

I (20m) didn’t start drinking until I went to college, and for the past year and a half since most of the times I’ve drank have been socially, with friends, coworkers, and significant others. I don’t drink too often either, as I’ll go a month or two without drinking, and at most I’ll drink I few times a week for a couple weeks. 

As for what I’ll drink, it ranges from vodka to beer, wine to whiskey, and virtually anything. One commonality is that generally I drink to get drunk, often exceeding my limits without trying and either vomiting or blacking out on occasion. 

In my limited experience with alcohol tho, I cannot recall a single time I have ever acted violently while under the influence. While there have been multiple times I’ve lost memory due to excessive drinking, and wouldn’t remember if I DID get violent on those occasions, I’ve never had the people I was present with while drunk tell me after the fact that I had been violent in any way. 

That all changed last night, when drinking whiskey with my brother led to a physical altercation that left both of us pretty bruised up, and ended with him being brought to a police station and myself being hospitalized. Thankfully, no charges were pressed on either of us, no major injuries occurred, and no property was damaged. 

This was an occasion during which I lost a lot of memory of how events unfolded, but after talking to my brother about it it seems as though I initiated the physical violence. This would be the first time I’ve ever gotten violent while drunk, and the experience has me concerned about whether I can ever drink again without worrying about losing control. 

For additional details that may be relevant, we had each had 6 shots of whiskey (to my knowledge), which is towards the low end of number of shots I’ve taken before blacking out. It was my first time drinking anything in over a month, and while I had been struggling to cope with depression, irrational thoughts/actions, and a general sense of anger and sadness for the past month, I started drinking with my brother last night in a pretty good and cordial mood. My brother and I have our history of squabbles, and the occasional physical altercation is a rare occurrence. However we had no ill feelings towards each other coming into last night, no recent fights/arguments, and we were having a typical conversation of opening up and catching up on each other’s problems after a couple days of doing our own things. 

As mentioned before, this event has me concerned about the next time I get drunk. I plan on taking a particularly long break from alcohol in light of this, but in the meantime I would like to figure out the root of what caused this issue, and whether this one-time drunken violence is something that I should expect to happen again. 

Regardless, I would love to hear advice on how I can avoid this sort of thing from happening when I do decide to drink in the future.",3

I was a weekend binge drinker for years in high school and college. My husband works strange hours, and once Covid hit, my drinking became during week nights as well. Recently it turned into binge drinking since I work from home. 

So I was coming off of a week long binge and decided to start cutting back. Apparently I did so too early. 

It started with all of the things on my walls in my bedroom coming off of the walls and floating around the room, then the scary stuff started. There was always a new person outside every window I would look out of. I looked out one window to my neighbors house and there was a girl twisted in all directions waving at me in one of their windows. One man had chopped a girls head off and was holding it, many of them were holding weapons in my direction. There were many knocks on the walls with no one there, doors opening on their own, voices that would talk shit to me in my head, shadows on the walls. I will never forget it. It was absolutely terrifying.

I was fully aware and not delirious during this whole ordeal. My mom literally laid in bed with me as the time passed. 

I did seek medical help and got Ativan to take home. I don’t think I will ever be touching alcohol again. I didn’t think I was at the point where that would happen, but here I am. I just wanted to share my experience just to remind everyone to taper properly or seek medical help if you want to quit!!",9

I am a 20 year old junior in college who loves to drink. Honestly, I think about being drunk when I want to feel happy. I am due to turn 21 (USA's drinking age) at the end of the month, but I have some concerns. When I was a freshman in college I would get black out drunk at least 5-6 nights a week, and I almost liked it. Going into my sophomore year of college, I had a hard time making friends and fell into a heavy drinking habit (4-5 nights a week of 3+ mixed drinks per night) to cope with my loneliness. Then Corona hit and I went home. I drank considerably less because of my parents but would cherish the nights I got tipsy enough to put myself to sleep. In June I went on vacation with my mom and blacked out, hard. It felt normal for me, but my mom took it to heart and really thought I had a drinking problem. I had been considering this possibility for a while but decided to restart therapy and change my medications to see if it would help. Fall semester of 2020 was okay. I was definitely depressed but tried really hard to make friends despite Corona. I had a fake ID which made obtaining alcohol easy, but it was taken january this year. Since then, I've been okay. Alcohol cravings have only been a few times a week mostly when I am feeling really depressed and lonely. As my 21st birthday comes closer the desire to drink and get drunk gets bigger and bigger. I don't know if I can trust myself when I turn 21 not to get drunk as much as possible. Am I an alcoholic or just really depressed and lonely? The idea of becoming sober is crazy to me because I know if I get depressed enough I won't even have the energy to drink or go out and get a handle. Am I an alcoholic or just really depressed and looking for a quick mediation? I'm scared that without alcohol I have no way of making friends and being even more lonely than I am now. I'm so lost.

Lately, I've been feeling a bit walloped by what I assume is Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms. My memory is QUITE foggy, which caused me to panic a bit. Of course, this lead to a pretty intense bout of depression due to the fact I thought I was beginning to lose my mind (or a brain tumor, definitely thought I had a brain tumor a few times. Hypochondria at its finest) Definitely a bit snippy too when it comes to my emotions, every little thing feels like the absolute end of the world. 

Just so uncomfortable and, in all honesty, scary. I've been to the doctor and had blood drawn and everything-- so all good on that front. 

I guess I'm just not really feeling like myself, which was pretty fucking confusing until I suddenly remembered, ""Oh! PAWS!"" Remembered learning about it in rehab, but I guess I thought I was out of the woods. I thought wrong.

I only drank with people, but as soon as I wasn't allowed to meet them. I consumed a lot alone. I dealt with lonely ness and the pressure of work and with past traumas. So I choosed alcohol. But today a friend intervene and dare me if I could throw my alcohol away. Because I had clearly a problem. I couldn't and ask her if she could do it for me.

It's not been easy, but I am proud of myself. Reading the posts on here have really helped and certainly made me feel not alone in going through this. So thank you everyone!!

I've already noticed differences, I'm looking after myself better. My belly has gone down (I assume from the bloating), I'm so much better in the morning without the hangover and so much more productive during the day.

But what I don't understand.... I still miss alcohol and want a drink.  Will it ever go away? 

I've made so much progress the past 5 days, I just can't understand why my mind still wants the alcohol. 

Does anyone else have this?",19

I'm not sure where else to post this. I've been struggling with alcohol for a few years now and I think it's finally my breaking point. Let me explain what's going on......  


First, I've had a lot in 2020 and even this year as well. Like heavy drinking 5 days a week. Definitely more than I should.  


But I feel like this has been culminating for a while. 2019 wasn't great for me either, but it just got worse, and now I'm at the point where I'm wondering exactly HOW long I've been drinking too heavily for. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?  


I'm 33/male, btw.  


Anyway, I just had some blood work done at my doctor's and my liver enzymes were sky high. I'm horrified I have a scarred liver. I'm sure I at least have a fatty liver.  


I had a ""come-to-Jesus"" moment mid February and drastically cut back on my drinking, but I'm thinking this is the moment that pushes me over the edge to stop completely.  


I'm horrified right now. I have an ultrasound on March 12th where I they're going to scan my liver and check for any damage. Needless to say, the wait until then is going to be excruciating.  


How worried should I be here? For context, in September 2019 at my last physical, my enzymes and liver functions were normal.",8
2021-03-03 13:47:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lx1848/short_wds/,Short WDs?,"So I posted a few days ago how I once had withdrawals (severe anxiety, slight leg shaking, sour stomach) for about 3-5 days after I went on a 6 week 1/2 bottle a day trip because I was bored (not an excuse tho) 

So I thought I was in the clear because this was months ago and I got drunk for 1 day, next day felt fine and then 2 days later I drank for 2 nights in a row while out with some buddies. Within the 24 hour mark of the last drink I was suffering from horrid horrid anxiety and Nausea, couldn’t eat (but didn’t puke) 

However by the next day the time I woke up I just had some mild anxiety and no appetite, and after 48 hours I felt pretty fine, was able to eat, little to no anxiety.

What could this be? Usually WDs peak at  3-4 days from what I read, it’s weird how just around the 22-24 hour mark it feels the worst, and by the 48 hour mark I start feeling “better” 

Could it just be straight anxiety? Kindling affect would product a worse WD from what I heard, but it felt similar/less than the original WD I had months ago",7

I work in the commission only financial sector where me being spot on can with a nice, positive attitude can make or lose my clients and me a substantial amount of money. 

I don’t miss drinking at all but I’m afraid I’ll have no choice but to go back if I don’t get my drive and motivation back for my career.",5

I'm a casual alcoholic that gets into benders (drinking heavily every night alone for weeks) before I either get tired of it and quit, and/or force myself to quit even though I don't want to because of financial reasons (I don't want to tell my old mom I need to borrow some money because I blew so much on booze. The shame is stronger I guess) 

But, whenever I'm on this type of bender, even if it only lasted for two weeks, I just get so fucking scared of the idea of quitting. Even though there's been periods of sobriety that lasted way longer than that and that were shitty in their own way (boring, lots of anxiety and un-aimed aggression), the idea of having to be clear-headed all the time just horrifies me. 

I know I'll thank myself later if I actually do quit this goddamn bender, but at the moment I just can't see why. Those rose colored classes are just so fucking nice.",42
