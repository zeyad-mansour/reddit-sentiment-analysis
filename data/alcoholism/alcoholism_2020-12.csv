I'm at three weeks sober now, and progressing well with my AA group in terms of dealing with the feelings and staying on the wagon. Unfortunately, on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas for those who don't have it in their country) I made a mistake. We had a sit-down meal with my family and my grandma who came over, and once everyone was seated, I offered to grab everyone a drink. The order came to two proseccos and three beers. 

So I went to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of prosecco, two regular beers, and an alcohol free one for me. All of them Ghost Ship brand, so once poured, the alcohol free and regular ones look identical unless you're \*really\* looking.

So I get back to the table and hand them out, and you can probably see where this is going. I was \*certain\* I knew which one was the non-alcoholic one, but I messed up. I served the non alcoholic one to my brother or dad, and an alcoholic one to myself. Now, non alcoholic beer has gotten pretty damned good lately, and you often can't even taste the difference between the alcoholic version and the regular, so I didn't notice anything until we'd all finished our drinks, and I spotted that I had a little buzz going on. I've been drinking long enough to recognise what that buzz is; I'd drunk a regular beer.

My brother and dad didn't seem to notice, so I kept quiet and used a different coaster for my beer the rest of the meal and hangout time afterwards so I didn't make the mistake again. 

I'm kind of in two minds as to whether it's even worth mentioning to my AA group, and it's kind of embarrassing as it was such a dumb mistake. 

What do you think? Should I just keep it to myself? I didn't do it on purpose, and I haven't drunk or been tempted to since.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44340786}"

If I am, then I accept that.  I'm not in denial and if someone were to tell me I'm an alcoholic (after having enough information to make that diagnosis) then I wouldn't fight it and would probably say they're right.

For transparency, I never have the urge to drink unless I'm in a social setting - and even then I've been much better with saying no recently.  I've never drank alone.  I've never walked to the beer store alone unless I was going to a party later that night.  I turn down drinks constantly when people offer them to me at gatherings.  But when I have one drink with friends, I end up wanting to have as many as I can until I pass out, which usually surpasses 10.

That being said, the main reason I don't drink is because I know it exacerbates my negative qualities to the absolute maximum.  Alcohol is responsible for nearly all of my the awful things I've ever done.  I've lost god knows how many friends due to alcohol-induced decisions.  I've done so many self-sabotaging things while drunk and my life would be so drastically different if I'd never had a drink.

With all that being said, I haven't had a drink since December 12th.  I haven't fist-pumped over it but I am happy with myself since in that time I've said no to around 10 invitations to drink.  I had a temporary roommate for a few weeks who would drink around 10 tallboys every 2 days and who kept telling me to drink with her but I said no every time. 

Overall it doesn't feel like I'm resisting any strong urges - but like I said before, if I did cave and have 'one drink', that 'one drink' would turn into 10+ and I'd hate myself for it.  I used to be horrible at saying no to that first drink, especially in my college days, but I've gotten much better and I think it has a lot to do with not only self awareness of who I am when I drink, but also a deep hatred for the behaviour of intoxicated people.

Almost 72 hours sober and no withdrawal symptoms.","I've been drinking 99% of everyday for almost 10 years. In the last year or so my consumption has increased. I'm drinking somewhere in the ball park of half a fifth of whisky and a sixpack. 

I've definitely tried to quit many times, but never really made it long enough to experience withdrawal symptoms. My consumption has become dangerous and irresponsible. Hiding bottles everywhere so I can take shots without my wife knowing (she thinks I only drink beer). Drinking whisky and beer while driving. Needing to take shots before work or anything social. Just bad.

So 3 days ago I woke up with my organs hurting (quite normal) and I decided to give quitting a solid attempt. I'd been dreading this because I've read how unpleasant and sometimes dangerous withdrawal can be.

So I find myself 3 days in and nothing. Maybe a slight headache on day 2 and I'm peeing more than normal. I don't know if I'm just lucky or the worst of it will just come later for me. I've been smoking CBD weed, but that couldn't possibly be preventing all the nasty shit that happens from quitting. I'm honestly perplexed.

2020-12-30 01:38:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/kmwznb/im_21_and_both_of_my_parents_are_severe/,I’m 21 and both of my parents are severe “functioning alcoholics”,"Hello all. I’m 21, I live by myself several states away because I’m in the military, but I visit home on the holidays. I joined at 18, so I’ve been out of the house for a few years, but they’ve been drinking heavily since I can remember. My mom is the worst. 

I want to preface all this by saying they’re great parents and their honestly fairly successful and have good paying jobs, this is why I say “functioning”. 

Anyway, my mom is my main concern so I’ll just talk about her, I’m really looking for some general advice as far as getting her to stop or at least lessen her drinking. 

So about a year ago, she got that bypass surgery or whatever to lose weight, she wasn’t severely overweight, but she was probably like 220lbs at like 5 foot 8, so kinda a bigger gal and she said she always had “negative self talk” i.e. looking in the mirror and thinking “wow you’re so ugly” she said she tried all the diets and exercising but she just couldn’t stick to it and it made her unhappy, she takes prozac for her depressive thoughts, though I honestly don’t think she neeeeds them necessarily, but that’s neither here nor there. 

Anyway, these are two of my new main concerns with her. 1. She had that surgery so she shouldn’t be drinking nearly as much as she was before — but she is. 2. She drinks soooo much alcohol, let alone for someone being on Prozac. 

Now this is the absolute biggest concern of mine. She works late very often. She works about 30 minutes from home, and grabs a 4 pack of sutter home mini wine bottles. They’re like 6 oz each and 12.5% alcohol. She finishes 4 of these by the time she gets home and is heavily intoxicated by the time she gets home. She’ll sometimes text me around like 10pm at night telling me about her day or asking me random stuff but with countless typos and the texts seldom make much sense. 

This isn’t new behavior. I remember even as a 12, 13, 15 year old, etc. that I couldn’t have a conversation with her that she would recollect the next day if it was after like 7pm on her day off because she’d be drunk by then. 

She’s 55 in a couple months and I’m very very concerned about her health. As well as my step dad’s health. Not to mention the people around her on the road while she’s drinking and driving. She’s been doing this for over a decade at least and nothing bad has happened yet. Key word, YET. No drunkenness at work, no DUIs, no accidents, etc. etc. but it’s only a matter of time before she kills herself or someone around her because of her drinking habits. 

I only have a few more days left during this visit home and I’d like to bring it up to her again with some solid content about quitting. I’ve talked to her about it since I was a teenager, but she never seems to heed to my warnings. She talks it down like it’s not that big of a deal and says she’ll chill out but then continues to do it. She also snacks SO hard when she gets home drunk — probably going to regain the weight she lost from the surgery honestly and she’ll wonder why she’s gaining weight because she likely doesn’t remember getting the munchies in the middle of the night. 

Again, just want to note — they’re wonderful parents, they’ve always been there for me, give great life advice, very smart, I’m very proud of their accomplishments and such, I just really want to help them with their alcohol addiction.

It didn't always used to be like this.  I could have 3-4 shots and be all set for the night, content, interested and happy, without having the compulsive urge to have more.  I abused adderall for a couple of years and it really fucked me up.  Super anhedonic, constantly bored and mildly anxious/uncomfortable all the time.  As this happened, my taste for alcohol massively increased.  I didn't like weed anymore or even adderall, but alcohol was just something I felt a NEED for - which was certainly not there prior to my adderall abuse.

These days, I have a routine.  Stay sober for 6 days, on day #7 get plastered.  I attempted to replace alcohol with weed, but it's just not the same.  If I go a whole week without getting plastered...I can't imagine it.  Being drunk is just SO much better than existing sober, bored and uninterested out of my fucking mind.  If I didn't have significant self control and the awareness of how horrific alcoholism is, I'd be a raging alcoholic.  **Every waking moment, I either want to be asleep or drunk as fuck.  How do I exit this cycle?**

I know I have a problem, it’s still hard to want to quit, drinking makes life so much more bearable, without it I get bouts of suicidal ideation and depression whenever I have a quiet moment. I’ve heard people sometimes have to hit rock bottom before they’re ready to quit but I’m not sure I have one that doesn’t end with me dead or in jail. Been going to AA for about a month but it only helps a little. Any suggestions on how to internalize wanting to quit?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5159884}"

So I recently quit drinking because my wife and I are expecting our first child this August. She had to quit a lot of things for the baby, so I thought the least I could do was give up something I enjoyed. So out went the beer. 

I have been a beer guy since I was about 19 years old. Started in college and have probably had at least a beer at night since then. (Sure there are few times when we are traveling or I have a work thing where I can't, but for the most part beer has been my friend.) 

This is where the anxiety hits. I used to have it bad in high school. Like I could not function in social settings with people that were not in my bubble. I had never noticed, but this all went away when I made a few friends in college. Parties had beer and slowly, I was not afraid of strangers. I probably owe beer a little bit of a thank you. I bet I wouldn't have had the social confidence to meet my wife had I not had a few drinks. But that's it's own thing. 

It is also worth nothing that my Dad is a heavy drinker. I cannot remember a time that he was not drinking a miller lite. Now that I am thinking about this, I think he may have a similar problem to myself. He is the life of the party, but he is always 3-4 beers in before the party starts. 

That being said, I do not think I am an alcoholic. Quitting was not hard. Once we found out we were pregnant it was pretty easy to set it aside. After all, it is not forever. I will have beer again. (and probably still will) But boy has the anxiety come back fierce. It sucks and I am sure that some of it is the fact that my family is growing for the first time in a long time. So my world is shaking up. Plus this pandemic shit is for the birds. 

I just never thought my drinking was covering up an anxiety disorder. 

Anyone else struggle with this? It has definitely put in perspective the role alcohol plays in my life and I am not sure how I feel about it. Yes, I hate the anxiety. But I thought I was better and now I feel like I am still that 16 year old kid that thinks everyone is laughing at him. It's the worst.",3,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6147842}"

I've displayed binge drinking behavior for 10 years, but I've never been an every-day drinker. It's not hard for me to go multiple weeks without drinking. I've never had alcohol interfere with my job. 

The problem is, when I do drink, I either drink everything in the house, or until I pass out. I have zero control once drinking starts. 

This means that I never buy liquor, and I typically only buy 6 packs of beer or a bottle of wine Friday after work.

On Christmas Eve, I decided to buy a 15-pack and a bottle of wine (for my partner), thinking that *this time* I would have control. I ended up drinking everything and staying up all night, ruining Christmas because I slept all day. I had promised my partner that I would play her favorite board games with her that day, but obviously that didn't happen.

I think the answer for me is that I need to stop drinking alcohol. I don't know if I am an alcoholic, or if I have a variant of alcoholism, or if this is the start to full-blown alcoholism (although, it's been 10 years of consistent behavior. But not sure that matters). 

I don't think that I can keep falling into the trap of thinking *this time* I will have control. I could keep buying a 6 pack every week, but what about times like a few days ago when I decide to buy more? What about times when my partner wants to keep alcohol in the house on a night when I decide to drink?

The answers to those questions are not good. I know the best answer is to cut alcohol out of my life, but it's hard to come to terms with.

I (33M) have been drinking almost every day for the past 16 years. I told myself it gave me energy and confidence, and helped control my anxiety and depression. In reality I used it to hide my emotions in order to avoid getting hurt. For the past several years I have been very close with a girl, fwb situation. She expressed several times she wanted to make it official, but I wasn't letting her in. She never complained about my drinking, and honestly probably didn't know the extent of it. 

Well lately my feeling were getting out of control as I realised she was everything I needed and I could finally shake the booze and hang out with her sober. So I drank less, and then stopped. I proceeded to ask her out, and she said yes! Unfortunately she had other guys in her life I wasn't aware of, and things got complicated fast. We discussed our feelings for a few days and she ended up saying she needs space to figure things out.

As hard as it was I agreed to give her space. Now here I am, sober, no woman I love, not even my best friend and closest confidant I had before. Drinking filled all my time before. Feeding my OCD and getting me to diligently clean the house etc.. now without her I lost my gaming buddy, my daily texting friend, my lover.. and my fall back is sitting on the shelf with a cork in it. Not drinking is difficult, but not texting her is twice as hard. It's dead cold of winter, and everything is shut down for covid. All my friends and family are big drinkers, and it's difficult to be with them and not fall back on the bottle.

I come from a family of alcoholics. My mother has 6 siblings, 4 have died from cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol induced dementia. My mother has always been a heavy drinker but has ""functioned"" more or less. In the past ten years, we have suffered back to back tragedies which have traumatized us all and exacerbated our respective vices.

During COVID, I moved out of my house and in with my mom because trying times and all that. I ended up having to long-term rent an Airbnb because my mom would get drunk and verbally abuse me (she used to physically abuse me when I was a teenager when she drank, but stopped and never spoke about it again)

Fast forward to now and its been over half a year since I've seen her. She invited my boyfriend and I over for boxing day dinner. She really made it seem like she put a lot of effort into it and I was excited to move on. When I got there, her house looked like an episode of hoarders. There was broken glass everywhere, cigarette butts all over the house and more empty liquor bottles than I've ever seen. She stumbled around throwing our gifts at us and insisting she wasnt drunk, just ""sad"" because my brother wasn't there yet with the turkey. When he showed up she berated him for being late and then tripped and fell on her face, smashing her forehead open. We dressed the wound, she stood up and fell again. Keep in mind my 5 and 9 year old nieces were witness to all of this.

Eventually she passed out and we left. As we were leaving my mom was yelling profanities at us half-coherent.

We didn't hear from her at all yesterday but today she sent me a lengthy facebook message saying she was ""not sure what was going on in her brain"", that she was embarassed, that she knows she's self destructive and she's sorry she can't be a better mother to me.

My question is, am I an asshole for just wanting to shut down and never speak to her again? I've never had a functional family get together, never had a calm and happy gathering, and I'm sick of seeing my nieces so worried over something they can't understand. I don't know how to reply to my mom or proceed.

Your casual ""one bottle of red with dinner once a week"" doesn't pay the rent, the guy stopping off for a 4 litre box after work every day does.

They manipulate social norms via marketing and advertising to create that kind of peer pressure, in much the same way that the de Beers cartel artificially stokes demand for diamonds. Shaming people into paying thousands for a worthless rock because they're less of a man if they don't? Drink with us! What kind of loser won't drink with us?

They offer serving sizes that encourage buying in quantity, knowing that people won't want to ""waste"" what they spent money on by pouring it away the next morning. How is it possible that a 2 litre box of wine is only $1 less than a 4 litre box of the same wine? Twice as much for only $1 more? Which would anyone buy?

And also never forget, that the government makes a huge amount of money from the alcohol industry from taxes and duties, so there is an ingrained cultural conflict of interest. Sure, healthcare costs and policing costs would reduce dramatically from alcohol restrictions in the long term, but will cost a lot more in the short term, and politicians are always chasing the quick gains. And also, seeing the debacle in the USA over mask-wearing because of COVID, what politician would risk career suicide in even suggesting an alcohol ban? Fuck you don't take our booze!

Next, I believe that information is actively being suppressed by lobbyists and marketing companies in how harmful alcohol abuse is, the same way that the oil, sugar and tobacco industries did in the last century. The government (in Australia, at least) is very much in the pocket of Big Booze. Victim-blaming takes place here too - we're just a small minority who can't drink responsibly, and aren't representative of the typical drinker, so it's all our own fault apparently. 

If you ever want to know why anyone does anything, start by following the money. Alcoholics are having their lives ruined, their families and friends lives ruined, people literally dying from alcohol, because shareholders demand profit.

We have our own, personal battles, which are more than hard enough. But until the bigger problem is tackled, people like us will continue to be caught up in this web. Losing jobs, losing marriages, losing our lives. And for what?

At first it just felt like something was missing without a drink but it was still at least enjoyable.  Now everything is kind of just bland and nothing really excites me anymore.  

The thing is, it was a lot like this before I started drinking and having alcohol in my system always kind of added some color to my day and made me feel things more.  The first time I had a drink a long time ago it was like the first time I saw life in color or something.  Like I finally had what everyone else has by default but it was just on borrowed time until I came down from my buzz.  

So now, it’s like a much more severe version of that.  Now it’s the normal depressive symptoms I’ve had all my life mixed with a dependency or addiction to alcohol.  

It would be nice to be able to enjoy life.  At least the hobbies that I used to like to do.  Nothing really makes me feel any excitement anymore and life is kind of just bland.",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.81826574}"

Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from mind altering substances, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I’ve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by “love” or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.
There is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It’s been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn’t comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I’ve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.

There is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection. I've lost 50lbs over this year from light exercise and not eating (as much) ice cream. I signed up for and passed 3 classes (71.8 in spanish but I'm proud of that C). And I'm daily, sometimes every minute, looking out for future me by making better choices.

I was VERY clear about how I was feeling ( anxiety, nightmares ecc) and in ALL 4 OCCASIONS he never once took the time to comfort me or even ask me how things were going. I started, for once, fighting back when he got ugly under the influence (the day after of course), but mostly because deep down what was bugging me was seeing how after a similar experience, he continued drinking (until he finally stopped for a month, only to get back at it ) and ignored my SOS's. To make a long story short, I left him out of desperation, and the day after he said he's uncertain about wanting to continue being together. He doesn't want to come home because he says it gives him perspective on life and us. He said he can't say I love you anymore because it was never in his style, and that he's comfortable with saying he misses me if I ask him because "" I don't miss people when they're not around"". We are currently together, but all of the sudden, I've stopped receiving any confirmations of love and when we talk about what lead to the explosion he talks about ...well... nothing really. I mean he realizes I haven't done anything to him. He says he's uncertain about life and the direction he wants to go in so he's not sure if we can be together. I called him out on being a bit of a covert narcissist and he doesn't like it. Every time I try to gently explain how it makes me feel when I try to talk to him about ""the vomit"" incident, precisely that he never asked me how I was doing, he gets angry. The thing about this dude is that every single time I want to communicate my feelings, he blames me for something that isn't an actual thing I've done to him, just normal silly couple of things. What the f\*ck is going on?  Is it just me or is he being really childish? I don't think it's very mature to never say "" I fucked up, sorry"".

I get to the point where I do incredibly stupid things inevitably. For instance, got drunk at a bar, hooked up with a  guy, and drove home with no pants on. A few days after that I stayed at a  hotel drinking straight from morning to night and barely eating and throwing up every night. I woke up after the fourth night feeling like literal death. Shaking, anxiety, paranoia, and puking with tinges of blood. Had my mom pick me up and take me to the ER and they gave me outpatient detox meds. On Christmas, I was feeling physically terrible and suicidal so I had my mother take me to an inpatient mental health/detox center. I was basically better off staying home. They withheld my meds I brought from the ER for about 6hours, didn’t do the blood panel that they said they would do, and treated me like I was an annoyance (even though I’m an extremely passive and polite person). I  felt like a disgrace and the staff was extremely rude to almost every question (whichever few) I had. I left feeling worse than when I came in. At least the inpatient center gave me references for therapists and sobriety groups. Anyway, my mother is using every circumstance to yell and me and say how I deserved this. I know I messed up but I’m actively seeking help. I don’t want to drink anymore. My own father died when I  was a baby due to alcohol poisoning, and it runs in both sides of my family, so I definitely have a genetic predisposition. I feel like shit and an absolute fuck up.

Her routine when she doesn't have any activities which requires her to go out the house is that she start to drink in the morning, then going nap for  few hours and in the evening she drinks again. Her problem with drinking started couple years ago, but now it seems to intesify. She hide alcohol and drink when noone see. Of course except naping in the middle of the day, when she is drinking she is talking nonenses and it is hard to communicate with her. 

She knows that her drinking problem affect us, that we are woried. However she doesn't consider her drinking as a problem. When she need to be up, go somewhere, drive etc. Then she is responsible and sober. But it is not often when she have activities during the day (espacialy due to corona). The other problem is that it is basiclly impossible to change her mind about antyhing, even when she is not right she will keep her opinion. When someone point out something to her, she takes offens.

My father is trying his best to do something about it. Couple times he tried to just not keep any alcohol in the house, but then she buy her own bottle and hide it. He is finding empty bottles, talk with her about it, keep mad about it, but it does nothing, only makes her angry, scream at us and takes offense. Many times she promised not to drink during the day, or to drink only during the weekend, but next day or even same day she is drunk again.

He is clueless and dont know what to do, so do I.

Lately even my parents best friends do some kind of intervention (as ofcourse they see when she is drunk). They ask why she is drinking during the day, they told her that they love her and are worried that she can drink with them in the evening. My mother cried and take offense at them. When they called to my father to give them best whishes during the christmast time, she didnt reply as she feels offended. 

My idea is argue with her about her drinking and tell her that I wouldn't talk to her until she is get a grip. But this may be not proper behavior, moreover it will hurt my father too.

I drank heavily from about 15 to 22 or 23, and then continued to spiral out into deep alcohol abuse.  About 3 handles of sauza a week for just me because I liked to drink alone.  And this got worse and worse until last year.
   I am now 32 and my kid is 3.  Last year I dropped him off at the babysitter's on my way to work.  Decided to stop to buy a couple nights worth of Sauza.  Right afterwards, a man driving a large van veered into my oncoming lane at 55 mph into my little 04 corrolla that I always had to fold my six foot four frame into.  I nearly died that day.  Broke 19 bones, and my lower intestine split open.  Spent a month in the hospital, hours away from my home and my son.  And girlfriend.  My mother traveled hundreds of miles to stay in my hospital room tirelessly.  For 30 days, she slept on two hard plastic chairs pushed together.  My shattered leg, broken feet, ribs, sternum, and elbow, as well as being split from the top of my pubes to the top of my abdomen with a giant wound vac in place.  Had a tube that funneled my shit back up through my nostril that i was chained to for weeks.  No food, no swallowing water.  It was hell.  I couldn' t roll over, and definitely walking was out of the question for 6 months.  Spent another month in a nursing facility once i was able to poop and sit up in a wheel chair.  I had what is called an x-fix fully extending my left leg out.  Very rough. Anyways.  Through that ordeal I vowed to never drink again, even though I have tried and failed to quit many times.

   Today, I am able to walk normally again and can even do a small hop or skip, a twirl, even a goofy jogging thingy.

Like alcohol hasn't for fuck sake? We live in UK. In Poland where I'm from we have disulfiram implants available on Polish NHS, I was so shocked it's not available in UK,  wtf?! He's so delusional,  he won't get it to his head that he has a big problem and the only way is to stop once and for all forever until he's dead. He always says he needs to relax and enjoy but he's always doing stupid things, crying and smashes himself to filth. When he's pissed he's telling me what a boring life he's got but I'm the only one working here, doing as much overtime to pay all bills and food so no brainer that when I'm off I just wanna stay home and rest. I'm spending as much time with him when he's sober when I'm off but there's no much you can do when there's no much cash in the pocket., so I get that it might be boring sometimes. He had a job once, long time ago but lost it because of booze. I love him so much and he's the sweetest, kindest person when he's sober that's why I'm trying to save him, he was my love from the first sight but I'm loosing this war. He's from Honduras, he's got Spanish interpreters on his sessions as his English is not perfect. I was trying to get him to AA meetings before COVID but he didn't wanna go because he said he doesn't understand everything and ""there were all alcoholic homeless people"" as he said and he's ""not alcoholic!"" I'm paramedic since 20 years, I hate alcohol,  have to deal with alcoholics and alcohol effects and destruction on daily basis,  my father had drinking problem as well so I just hate it and I don't drink at all, null, zero. I gave him everything what I possibly could, opportunities and comfort,  support,  tried to take his debit card away (he agreed for me to do that) but he always found the way anyway. Withdrawn some cash beforehand or so, had some other card with him and so on. I tried to get back home when I knew it's his day and took drinks away and pour it to the sink but it was only short solution. He's not even withdrawing so bad, just a bit of shakes, depression and anxiety. Also, what's pisses me of is why alcohol in UK is so bloody cheap? Like he can buy 5L of crap cider and get smashed! Why alcohol is being sold to someone who is already drunk?! He always goes to shop in the morning when still drunk and feeling his high is getting away. Why there's no effective pharmacotherapy? 
Sorry about the rant and probably too long post but I had to get off my shoulders and as you can see it's a lot. What else I can do? It's another Christmas in row fucked up this way and I just feel down.

This topic is a bit lighter, nothing heavy here, and most likely you already know this stuff. I hope though that you incorporate this into outlook of the world as you continue on your journey. 

For the problematic drinker (Aka the alcoholic), alcohol the substance is nothing more than a drug. It's sad then that this extremely dangerous drug is also totally legal and socially acceptable. 

Imagine starting work, and as a welcome present your boss got you a needle with some heroin in it. ""Thank you Bob for joining this great organization, we hope your time with us is pleasant"", next to it sit some chocolates. Some companies give you some wine and chocolates right? Imagine if at the annual christmas party everyone was sitting there rolling joints. The CEO took a bit puff, and said, alright everyone raise those joints, and everyone puffed at once. Would this be a Monty Python skit? 

This stuff is a drug, but you get exposed to it even as a kid, even if you grew up in some normal household chances are soon enough there's a BBQ or a swim over by the lake and some kind of socially acceptable gathering with people drinking. 

As the go-to drug of choice Alcohol wins hands down not because it's a great drug, it's just available and socially acceptable. I would go as far as to say, by far and wide people do not get together anymore just to talk. Maybe with very good friends, but there's usually some kind of agenda even among ""friends"" (of the garden variety). People get together to play music or sport, or some activity but by far and wide, most just like an excuse to drink. This is a problem when you do not drink and you realize how suddenly your ""friend pool"" just dried up. Don't worry, totally solvable, but just be aware most people (of the garden variety) basic Netflix watching, phone scroller with no other interests cannot fathom socializing unless there's some alcohol involved. 

Now this is not to say that many people can't handle alcohol. You get very responsible drinkers too. I know I'm married to one. You know how you can tell if someone is a responsible drinker? They've been smashed once or maybe twice their entire lives, or once was enough. And that smashed feeling that the binge drinker craves and why he/she needs another and another is something that a responsible drinker abhors. Mind Blowing but true. 

Alcohol throws a wide net. It's not that alcohol is a disease or that there's something special about it. Virtually any class A drug will destroy you. People drawn to abusing these drugs have underlying psychological issues. Alcohol then was just the drug that was available for such people. 

The stigma of alcohol abuse only comes much later. Consider if you were a ""druggie"" druggie. You know like a meth head with meth mouth. You would be ostracized by society. Let's just say it's not exactly main stream. To do this drug you need to be in the lifestyle. Before weed was legalized, same story. Just to buy it meant hanging around shady people (Disclaimer I don't do weed or any drugs). There's nothing druggie about some classy looking woman adding a bottle of wine to her grocery shopping. If you had to load up let's say 200 beers, people would just think you're having a party. No one would assume you're going home and going to drink all 200 alone with the curtains drawn. 

Teach your children then, perhaps not to be naive enough to think they won't try it but rather focus on making sure they have no underlying issues that will get them hooked on it. Warn them about the dangers, make sure they don't just trust the general picture the marketing media will thrust on them giving alcohol this classy look. Teach them from day one it's a legal drug, and the dangers of it. 

Not everything in life makes sense and yet we accept it. Consider when you're a kid you sing about old Mcdonalds farm right? And you give all the animals names. Even referring to this animals as ""friends"" and in the diminutive form, you are taught to love these animals, you personify them and you endear them. And then? You kill them and eat them! No I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, but I have always failed to see the logic in this. We are taught about Mary's little lamb as a pet, and then we see Lamb Vindaloo on the menu. So it is the same with the worlds obsession with alcohol and why a great deal of how humanity socializes has a drug element to it. 

The binge drinker with this cycle ""It's Monday, omfg"". Friday immediately after work. Smashed to relax from such a week. Saturday too. Sunday barely recovered already dreading the next day. The drinking adds or even creates this cycle and anxiety. What's then needed is a mini weekend on Wednesday - Yeah that will solve it. 

Be enlightened, and don't let anyone put you down. Sayings like ""Never trust anyone who doesn't drink"" are among some of the dumbest shit anyone can say. Don't feel bad for not drinking, or people who try to make you feel out of the ordinary for it, those are most likely the ones who have already identified (in part) their own problematic drinking. Don't preach it either or go into details, absolutely not worth it. A simple -> I'm driving, will suffice.",14,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46028766}"

I would drink a bottle of wine every night or a handle of jack over two days.

Eventually I was able to curb this problem. Then Covid happened. I started working remotely from home, and there are a lot of distractions and a lot of free time. So I started day drinking to pass the time, deal with work stress, loneliness from no longer being in a relationship, isolation from friends, weight gain, etc.

This started small around June/July. I would keep alcohol in my room, but decided enough was enough and I wanted to cure my habit.

The problem with this is I would drink my roommate’s alcohol (gin), replace it, and repeat the cycle. I also occasionally watch my friend’s cat, and would drink her alcohol without asking.

So for the last couple of months or so I’ve had at least one drink a day. Mostly the gin or mini bottles. One shot would turn to four. And I would black out at home and not remember things, like throwing up.

I just liked the feeling of being numb so I wouldn’t feel my anxiety and depression (which I also take meds for).

Last Saturday after talking to my family, I realized I needed professional help. So on Wednesday I had a virtual session with my old therapist. I was drinking and don’t remember much after that.

On Christmas Eve I was supposed to go to my parent’s house in the morning for the holiday. 7 pm rolls around and I’m still not there.

So my family gets worried and manage to track down my roommate. Apparently I was passed out on the floor and was breathing but incoherent. So she called an ambulance.

The first thing I remember is EMS carrying me down the stairs and putting me in the ambulance but I was in and out. I blacked out and next thing I know I’m awake in the ER (I think they did something to jumpstart me). I don’t even remember them doing a CAT scan.

My parents don’t live that far from me and because of Covid, my mom was the only one allowed to stay. She’s always been great at taking care of me.

Christmas Day is here and my mom and I are still at the hospital. My alcohol content was 4 times the legal level/half my blood was alcohol. And my heart rate had a hard time going down (upward of 140). They also found out I have a UTI. So they moved me into a room.

My mom is still with me and I love her so much and hate that she has to see me like this. I hate that I put my roommate in that situation and worried my family. I feel so guilty and embarrassed and like I ruined Christmas.",47,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51408696}"

My sister then told me that my mom has been drinking for 30 years. Besides one incident last year when my dad told me that she had been drinking a bit (which I thought she had since gotten over), I had no idea. I don't live in the same country as my mom and I only see her a couple of times per year. I have two older siblings but I am not close with them, and neither of them live anywhere close to my mom. I am 23 years old and having to deal with the fact that if my mom doesn't stop drinking, she might die in a few years. I don't know how to process this and I am in so much pain.

If I look back it makes so much sense now - why she's so overweight despite not eating very much; remarks from a friend; her other health issues. She says she has been drinking a lot more since the pandemic started because she works in a care home and she can't meet up with any of her friends, and my dad has been away so much so she barely ever gets to see him. She's deeply depressed, lonely, and doesn't feel like she has a meaning in life. I am so heartbroken and I just don't know what to do.

I know that she has to completely uproot her life and start over - she needs to move somewhere new, preferably without my dad because he is not supportive at all and actually makes her feel worse. She needs to go to therapy, but she says it doesn't want to. I think she would really benefit from meditation because I know how much it has helped me. But now I feel such pressure to make her understand these things, but I don't know how to talk to her without making her feel like I am forcing something on her. Ultimately I know it's a decision she has to make herself but I don't know what I can do to help, especially because I am not there with her physically.

I would sneak beers from my parents and get fucked up alone maybe once every 2-3 months in my senior year. From the ages of 19 to 21 I would drink during major holidays and parties (4-5 times a year) and nothing else. I would sometimes get wrecked though, it was always an “event” for me. 

THEN once I turned 21 I started to buy the tall cans of Redd’s Wicked Ale once every week or two, always managing to sneak it into my room and have a fun little movie night on a quiet weekend. This continued for a few years, and I knew it was a little unusual. 

At some point, at around 23 years old, I started to drink alone a lot more often... maybe three or four times a week. Never more than 2-3 drinks but always in a compulsive manner. 

This, along with bad mental problems, escalated to 7-8 drinks every night without any breaks. Sometimes I would stop for a bit, but I’d always return. Sometimes I’d up the ante to 12-15 drinks a night for a bit. Sometimes I’d drink during the day and lose count. But things have returned to around 6-8 drinks a night as of now. 

Can I get an honest opinion of a 26 year old guy who takes 6-8 drinks every night alone? I know it’s a big problem, but it’s been manageable for now. I also have some old issues that I’ve posted about in the past regarding my mental Illness.

I was in a bad place when I was 17/18 and would get blacked out 3 times a week
Things got better (as I'm still getting fucked up 2/3 times a week but not as bad), I ironically was also very active in sports at the time and stayed in shape, literally an alcoholic athlete 
Then I studied abroad a year in America last year  and got wasted 3 times a week again but the vibes were so good I didn't want to categorise it as alcoholism
Been smoking tobacco/else on a regular to daily basis too
Since this summer I haven't been drinking/smoking a lot because of covid and school but haven't felt a day to day difference
I just got told by my aunt I haven't seen in 3 years that there's something very different about my face, my mom telling me I look 'worn out' and it just... clicked
I don't feel like I have an alcohol problem right now (while I probably do) and never had a hard time to give up a substance (I did quit cigs effortlessly), so I don't know how deep I am.
I want to go back to being an athlete but I don't have any drive even though I've been mostly sober for 6 months

I have strong motivation to do great things in my life but never the drive to accomplish them and that makes me angry with myself. This is blurred by the fact that I don't see alcohol as an escape (at least not since I've been 17/18), I generally just want to have fun with my friends while being half aware of the problem. 
I think I'm scared to admit to myself that I'm wasting my potential/braincells/health as I've always managed to get along with school while drinking 

I don't know if any of y'all have been in similar situation, I feel like it's more insidious when you think you're aware of the problem while you actually aren't really
I feel like I've been lying to myself and sugarcoating my consciousness for too long

CW, s*icidality, sexual assault, mental health stuff in general. Questions: do people actually need friends? Request for hugs.","Yo, my long term primary partner is an alcoholic, has depression, started having panic attacks during covid lockdowns (although they seem to have passed at least). He’s a sexual assault survivor, the coercive abuse of power type; an ex cheated on him and left him for someone else, and he’s estranged from his parents, also alcoholic. He’s voiced suicidal thoughts more than once, although thankfully not recently. He’s fiercely private and independent and never wants to be pressured or anyone to pry. I’m really struggling with the knowledge that several people in our business/ community are uncomfortable with his obvious dependence and are starting to want to keep their distance. I’m scared for our community. Today we had a fight in which it came out that people have been talking. Fight brought on by a terribly timed attempt by me to suggest it would be better for our community if his problem /weren’t/ so visible to our clients and friends, prompted by my other partner voicing his concerns and other people’s to me. I’m scared for our community, which I absolutely cannot manage alone. He has a substance abuse problem, and can be avoidant, but he’s in many ways far more functional than me. I have complex trauma and/or ADHD, and anxiety, and my executive function is shithooooooooooouse. I’m also sick of having more empty bottles than our recycling bin can hold. I love him, I really don’t want to leave. He hardline won’t get therapy. He successfully quit for six months a year or two ago, then had one drink to celebrate...

Right now he’s numb and hurt, and stepping away from our friends. He’s gone from saying he doesn’t have friends, to he doesn’t /need/ friends, and he only cares about them from a business standpoint now. Is that....am I just imposing my own values on him, is that in any way a healthy or reasonable choice? Because it seems like a defence mechanism. Our friends have their faults, but overall they’re pretty damn good people. He named, like, one person who can probably be relied on to take his side on things and not judge him for drinking, as a friend earlier today. I don’t even know any more. 

I know I probably just need to hold my tongue. It’s not easy, either for my personality type or in this specific situation. And unfortunately my own poor mental health over the years has taken a toll on his. I’m getting therapy, taking medication, meditating, but I can’t undo that. Any tips for what helps with that, for what I can do to care for myself, and what I can do to support him?

Hey everyone, i apologize if this is a little long but I really need advice with dealing with a parent that drinks a lot but doesn't acknowledge their alcoholism or that they're in the wrong. 

For context, I (f19) am having to live at home due to COVID closures at my university and my father tends to drink a lot around holidays/ times of celebration. The problem is he's an angry drunk and he gets into a lot of fights, sometimes physical, with my mother and I. My mother and I have never been able to look forward to any celebrations because of his drinking and everytime I try to bring this up, his reply is always ""i never do anything wrong, this is all your mother feeding you lies and complaining about me for no reason"". He never seems to accept that he's the problem, nor does he understand that I'm old enough to see what he's doing and form my own opinions. 

I am also South Asian and my mother is very traditional in the sense that she will never leave her husband because other people in the community will look down upon her. My mom has a full time job while my dad has been unemployed for the past 6 years, so money to move out is non-existent. I am currently trying to find a job or some sort of income that I can use to get an apartment so that I can focus on college and my future but it's difficult to balance a good enough job and be a full time student. My hopes are that if I can find a place, my mother and I can just move in together without her having to tell people that it's because of my dad. 

Right now, moving out doesn't even look like a viable option so I was wondering if there's any advice/resources that may be helpful in situations like this. Honestly anything from thoughts and ideas, to words of wisdom, to just affirmations will be really helpful because this entire situation has left me completely broken down and hopeless.",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76943505}"

""This is My Story as well as My Testimony that I am ready to share with my friends and anyone else who comes across it! 

I truly hope you all read it with an open heart and see who the real me is. The broken me, the sad me, the depressed me, the mad me, the happy me, and the NEW me. I'm not good with words but I'm writing this from my Heart. 

If this gets out to just one person and touches their heart and helps them out then I feel like this all happened to me for a reason. 

First I will start out by saying I am an Alcoholic but haven't had a drop of alcohol in 97 Days, PRAISE GOD!!! 

After getting hurt in the Military in early 2001 spending over a year in and out of hospitals and getting medically discharged in 2003 my life went through a spiral. 

In March of 2005 nothing was going right for me mentally wise, I fell into a deep depression and was ready to take my life. I’ll never forget the day, I had an appt with my Mental Health Doctor and it just seemed like he was too busy to listen to anything I needed to say. I was in his office for about 10 min and then he said ok see you again in 6 months. It was like damn that’s all I’m worth to you is a measly 10 min every 6 months. Medicine can only do so much, I need someone who listens and actually cares. So I left and was ready to go home and take my life, as selfish as it may seem to some it’s where my state of mind was at the time. I felt like no one cared about what was actually going on inside of my head and none of my family or friends were going to understand either. That no one would miss me and everyone would be better off without me around. That's what major depression does to you!! It just honestly makes you feel like you are all alone and that no one actually loves you or even cares about you. At least that's how mine goes. 

But I decided before I was going to head home that I would go by the Humane Society one last time and look at the dogs. (I would go there once a week or once every 2 weeks after my appts. I was going to the hospital anywhere from 2 to 4 days a week.) There I would meet my best friend in the entire world who ended up saving my life, Cooper, who was only 3 months old. (He was born on Christmas 2004) 

Long story short I fell in love with him right there and so did he. I remember the lady telling me there were about 24 people who already put in paperwork to adopt him but for some reason, they contacted me just a few hours later and told me I could come to pick him up the next morning. Maybe she told them I was the one he needed and I'm so thankful cause in all actuality I needed him the most and he saved my life that day. 

In 2008 is where the Alcohol began, I was never really a person who drank. I moved downtown to some Lofts right behind a place called Lucky's Pub. Well, you can all guess where this story is going, yep started walking there every night and having a beer or 2 and watching the Astros. I remember 2 or 3 beers would get me buzzed in the beginning. Each day I would go back and try to drink one more. Drink the depression away, drink the pain away. Drink the sadness and madness away. 

Ever since I got back from the military I hated being around big crowds, being around people I didn't know. I just didn't feel comfortable. I didn't like being around people who drank so much because I felt so out of place. So then I started drinking before going to the bar. Started buying Jagermeister by the big bottles and drinking it before going out and it was all downhill from there. 

I hid my drinking very well just like I hid my depression very well. No one needed to know what was going on in my head because they weren't going to care anyways. 

Then of course with drinking and bars comes gambling and that has completely destroyed my life over the last 15 years. Honestly probably led me into drinking even more. I would have my house completely paid off and probably have my 2 dream cars sitting in my driveway right now if I had never found the games they call Texas Hold'em and Omaha!! Absolutely 100% took away everything from me. 

In 2014 I lost my Best Dart Friend who was like a father to me. Rusty who I met at Molly's Pub playing darts back in 2003 to 2005 timeframe. I think about him and miss him all the time. I could call him any time of any day when I needed to talk to someone and he got me and cared and loved me like a brother. 

2018 was the worst year of my life. I lost my 2 Best Friends that year. My Grandma Junker passed away from Cancer and I still cry all the time when I think about her cause I miss her so damn much. She would call me all the time just to say she loved me and to ask me how Dart's was going because she knew how much of Passion it was to me. I would call her all the time just to tell her how much I loved her and couldn't wait for her to come and visit so she could come to watch me play darts at Molly's Pub in Kingwood. She was my #1 Fan. She would always yell WOOHOO every time I would hit a Bull hahahaha. 

Then 2 months later 2 days before Thanksgiving I had to put Cooper to sleep and I miss him so much and I couldn’t do anything to save him. It eats me up all the time thinking about how I lost my 2 best friends just within 2 months of each other. 

So of course that led to a real deep state of depression. Just put on the happy face go play darts and don't show any emotion. Don't let anyone know what's really going on inside of you. Just drink drink drink and act like a complete fool. Bar hop so no one really knows how much you've been drinking. Drink at home before and after you go out so no one knows. 

I mean the alcohol will help you out more than your friends will anyways right? Well, at least that's what I thought or wanted to tell myself. Your friends and family don't care about your feelings. They don't care if you are crying your heart out inside. They don't care that you fight with your family every day. They don't care that the hospital forgot to send you your depression or anxiety medicine. They don't care that you miss your Grandma or your Dog. All they are going to do is laugh at you, talk bad to you, make fun of you and tell you to get over it just like they do on Facebook right? 

2020 comes along and Corona Virus hits and the drinking got worse, 15 to 20 beers a day every day. Twisted Teas. And the cool thing to do was take pictures of how much I was drinking and send to my friends. This is how much I loved Alcohol. Who can drink the most today? Never going anywhere and staying home 24/7 will drive someone who already deals with depression into an even deeper state of depression. 

Corona Virus led me back to online poker and it took everything I had, every dime I had in savings. Playing Poker while completely trashed is not a bright idea let me tell you. 

I even had to sell my car so I could get back on my feet. Sold all my Collector sets of Darts and who knows what else to get back on my feet and to still be able to drink every day. Yep that's how much alcohol had a hold on my life. Sold my car and all my collectors darts and sports stuff and still couldn't get enough alcohol. This is how bad the alcohol was. 

Depression was real and it was getting worse. None of my friends wanted to see me or hang out, always an excuse not to see me or only wanted to hang out inside their house when I would finally hear from them but I was tired of being cooped up inside the house. I wanted to go out to eat or go play darts somewhere when things started opening back up the 1st time but nope. Found out people were hanging out and going and doing other things with other mutual friends but I was never invited and it just led to an even deeper depression. This might not have been intentional of course I know but at the time this is how I took it, this is how my drinking and depression led me to believe things. That I really have no friends and no one really likes hanging out with me so what's the point in even being here anymore. Who would even really miss me if I took my life right now? 

I think that's how Wednesday, July 29th went. I think I got so drunk and so depressed I started thinking to myself what if I kill myself right now will anyone miss me? Will they regret blowing me off? Or will they just say damn that sucks and forget about me the next day. Well, I'll show them, screw them I thought. 

That was the night Grandma Junker haunted my dreams and saved my life. That was the night she told me she was disappointed in me and she was ""ashamed of me"" in my dreams. That I made her a promise that I would quit smoking. 

I’ve never told anyone this but I woke up that morning with a gun lying next to me. I passed out before I could do anything to myself that night. That's how drunk I was!! 

I'm so thankful she picked that night to fulfill her promise to me that she would haunt my dreams if I didn't fulfill my promise to her that I would quit smoking cigarettes. Crazy how that worked out. 2 years later she picked the night I was going to kill myself to haunt my dreams. That sounds so horrible but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. 

So I screwed up that Saturday, August 1st and ended up drinking a ton and smoking a ton and ended up losing 2 friends from drinking and arguing and I got drunk as a skunk. I mean I drank most of the day and then went and bought a 12 pack of twisted teas and an 8 pack of aluminum bottles bud light 16 ounces and drank them all at home, passed out, and then woke up Sunday morning and was like bro you have to stop. 

August 2nd was the last day I ever touched a Cigarette or a Beer and I would go a month without having alcohol. I told myself after a month you can spoil yourself with a ""Martini Shaken Not Stirred"" because at the time I was only giving up cigarettes and beer. I could responsibly drink liquor once or twice a week. And a few times I did drink responsibly and it was fun to be able to only have 1 or 2 drinks the 1 or 2 times I actually did it ha. But I'm not the guy who can only have 1 or 2. I'm the guy who's thinking about drinking the 6th beer while I'm still on the 1st one. 

September 14th, 2020 is the day that will forever change my life and the day that ended up leading to my sobriety. I don't remember what I did that morning, maybe I went to the hospital. I decided I would go to Brew Wingz afterward and get some Boneless Wings for lunch which turned into at least 8 Margaritas and 4 double shots of Jager and whatever else I had after. Ended up thinking my phone got stolen, the restaurant made me think someone stole it when they didn't. I blacked out a few times, I don't remember the whole night, only bits and pieces which really never happens surprisingly enough because I remember almost everything (Unless I've taken an Ambien lol). I ended up going home getting changed, driving to a poker house, driving back to the restaurant, and who knows where else then waking up the next morning and being so sick that I was in bed at home for a few days. I don't remember all that I just kind of figured it all out, pretty sad huh.... 

I was so hungover. I started getting so depressed and wanted to start drinking again because I didn't want to be around anymore. See the cycle here, depression leads to such negative thoughts and we want to feed our body anything to try and keep our minds off the depression and anxiety even if it is bad for us. But I was letting off that I was this happy guy who was looking for people to go to the gym with me and whatever else when in reality I knew no one was going to go with me which led to more depression. 

I was at the breaking point of now being sober and not wanting to be here anymore. Not wanting to be alive because I had no real friends I had no family who really loved me and I had no purpose in life, other than to be a burden on those I loved and who I thought loved me but really didn't. Or so that's what the depression was making me think. 

Depression causes you to think things that aren't true, sleeping disorders, behavior disorders, anxiety and addictive behaviors and it took my life away in 2020. 

I hit rock bottom with alcohol and I lost everything I worked for. I was completely broken physically and mentally and emotionally and I hated myself more than I've ever hated anything in my entire life 

On September 24th, 2020 I woke up and decided to get on Facebook for a few minutes and this is where my life was forever changed. 

On September 24th my friend Jason made a Facebook post that saved my life. My friend completely helped me change my life and I can never thank him enough. He had made a post on September 24th while thinking about his loved ones and posted ""The Blessing"" sung by Elevation Worship. (Worship Video on Youtube) 

It led me to endless hours of online browsing singing with old worship songs I loved as a teenager and finding new ones that just opened my heart and poured in the love of God and The Holy Spirit into my heart and soul. 

That's when I came upon a song called ""SO WILL I"" (100 BILLION X) and I just started balling my eyes out. I don't know what happened to me but I got down on my knees and told God I was so sorry for telling him I could live my life with him in the background and I could do it all without him and I didn't need him unless I needed something. I surrendered my life to God right there in my bedroom that day and told him I didn't want to do life anymore without him in it. 

That Sunday I was excited to go to church and I've never looked back. It’s not an easy road and I have my ups and downs every day but I love God with all my heart and I am learning every day to love myself a little more. 

If you don't know God and you feel like there is nothing left in life to look forward to and you are depressed and feel like no one loves you then I urge you to talk to God and feel the love he has for you. 

Sometimes God Breaks Us So That He Can Mend Us Into Who We Were Meant To Be!!!!!! 

There is so much more I want to say but I feel like this will explain my story to you all. 

Sometimes the ones who act happy and joke all the time are the ones hurting the most, so to those who may not be going through this, I urge you to think before you put your friends down, even if you are joking they may not take it that way. We don't always know who the ones are that are hurting the most inside. You could be the one to save a friend not destroy them. I have been guilty of this so many times as well but now being sober I VALUE all my friendships with everyone and hope you all feel the same way as well. 

This is My Story, My Testimony, My life, My Surrender to God, Me saying I'm not living life anymore without God right by my side, This is the new me and I can finally say I Love Me. I Love God. And I Love each and every one of you!!!! 

With all that said here are the lyrics to

I’m not perfect but I have to start somewhere and this where it starts right here with me. 

Alcohol is not something that I or anyone else ever has to worry about me going back to, it just won’t happen. I can’t explain it but Jesus has got my back through this and so do all of you. I have so much support it’s absolutely unreal.

Now, because she can go 24-48 hours without alcohol she feels like she doesn’t need therapy or AA. Even after the multiple dui’s, not being able to hold a job, section 8 housing, 4 young kids, and new health issues she STILL doesn’t see that she needs AA. I know it’s the disease talking for her but man .. I feel like after so many rock bottoms I’d want to stop. 

Which did happen. Once or twice a month like clockwork I (f25)would pick a day to binge drink.. I never exceeded twice a month. But then something bad happened when I got drunk and I hurt someone that I really cared about and lost them for forever. (I didn’t kill them or anything like that) and from that moment on I completely stopped .. sure it’s been less than 6 months and the first 90 days were HARD AS HELL.. but I stopped. No therapy. No AA. Just stopped. (I’ve been looking for a new therapist and I think I finally found one) 

So how can I get my sister to stop the drinking ? Can I finesse her into therapy? Do alcoholics NEED therapy to stop? Have you quit cold blood?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74969125}"

My stepfather abused me, my father could barely keep a roof over his head, and my mother was so in love with my stepdad. We were poor. We bounced around from apartment to apartment...yes 10 kids and all.

In high school, I was a VERY good student. I was accepted to almost every college I got into.

I had the chance to attend my in-state school, Pitt, for less than 12k per year after scholarships and fafsa. All I needed was a credit worthy cosinger...My father is a gambling addict janitor, my mom had no job, and my step father used to beat me...he was no help. I couldn't afford college. I had no responsible adult around me to help.

My parents sat me down, and told me I wasn't going to college...I had a full on mental breakdown. I wanted to become successful. I was the son of a janitor. I got good grades. I was supposed to become something. My father made no attempt to get his credit score in check. He didn't care if I went to college or not.

One night, at age 18, I broke down crying to him. I told him I was heartbroken that he didn't care about my future.

He broke out a bottle of Bribon Tequila, poured me a shot, and demanded I drank it....from that moment on...I was never the same.

This lead me down a dark path of destruction. I'm 22 now. Everyday since 18, I consumed alcohol. It was a  way to numb all of my problems. I felt like such a failure for not going to college. I hate my father for not giving me a chance...but also giving me my first drink at 18. I was hooked.

I was completely against alcohol/any mind altering substance growing up. I once told myself that I'd never ever be an alcoholic because I grew up with an alcoholic dad. Until I went to college and once I was a second year in college...I found that life with alcohol was fun. I only went out once every weekend and would be so turned off by even the thought of alcohol after that one night. Then it turned into drinking 1-3 beers while watching netflix after a whole day of classes/studying. Now I'm graduated and I drink every night, till I pass out. I've been an insomniac since I was 17, usually just entertained myself with social media until my eyes were heavy. Now, the thought of having to wait to fall asleep is so scary. Alcohol keeps the hard thoughts at bay + helps me sleep. But I know this isn't normal...I look at my friends and see that they don't depend on alcohol nearly the same way. I'm scared. If I feel really strong some days, I can go a day or so without drinking, but the next day, I still end up drinking a lot. I'm so young and have a loving family and so many friends who support/love me...I just want to know how to get out of alcoholism at a young age. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I know I use alcohol to escape.

2020-12-22 08:10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ki522h/them_mood_swings_tho/,"Them mood swings, tho?","I'm asking this as someone who is definitely no stranger to intoxication or addiction - just a bit of a stranger to alcohol. I've done damn near every reasonably-common drug at least once, am currently a few years recovered from a long term heroin addiction and am currently a regular ""high functioning"" user of meth.

However I've never been able to ""appreciate"" alcohol - I metabolize it in a dysfunctional way that renders me almost instantly sick. I don't get to any of the positive feelings upon drinking - just go straight to hangover-type symptoms. A modest glass of wine of a socially acceptable size and my face is red hot, I'm shaking, ears ringing, heart pounding, nauseous. Will probably hurl.

As a drug user, I've never been prone to random, wild mood swings - even at my worst points as an addict. Don't get me wrong, when I was in deep shit with heroin dependency I've thrown some impatience-tantrums when I needed to get well and couldn't for whatever reason - but the focus of the outburst was solely on that particular issue. Said some mean shit to a few people - but only in reference to whatever way I'd believed them to be a hindrance to my getting my ""medicine"" at that time.

Not saying this to berate anyone who has struggled with more random mood swings/outbursts at all - just explaining why I truly can't fully understand wtf just happened.

My friend is an alcoholic - moderate - heavy daily drinker for a couple years now. He's younger than me (22, I'm 29) and we're polar opposites in many ways; but we met at work nearly 2 years ago and sort of bonded over our mutual experience with dependency. For at least a year and a half now we've talked daily. Hung out probably every two weeks. Openly considered one another our best friend. Talked about deep shit plenty of times. Had a genuine friendship.

I've always tried to give him advice within reason, but never been preachy. That's one of the main points over which we bonded - we never judged the other's habits or provided unwanted lectures. We could discuss daily bullshit relating to our issues openly. That's always been our thing. We'd openly, regularly ""admit"" to being active addicts in our own respects to one another - we've both always known what's up.

A few days ago we were texting, and he made references to him ""not"" having an issue with alcoholism. Said something along the lines of ""Binge drinking by choice =/= alcoholism"" - to which I responded with something along the lines of ""Right and I'm just a daily meth user who chooses not to be able to get out of bed without it""

Fuckin 180. Announces to me via text that I'm an irritating bitch and he's tired of it. I'm just as irritating as everyone else and I'm too stupid to talk to - and that, frankly, he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I respond with ""wow. Okay.""

This was 3 days ago. A bit before Thanksgiving he was begging me to come with him to a family dinner, pretend to be his girlfriend so they'd leave his social life alone. About 2 weeks ago we hung out for an entire day - something we gotta kind of plan since our work schedules collide. A week ago he was relentlessly asking me what I want for Christmas. Not an hour before this outburst, he told me ""love you ya little shit"".

We haven't spoken since and I'm not sure wtf is even going on. Genuinely fuckin puzzled as to whether or not I should even take this outburst personally or seriously. If I'm more socially awkward than I think I am and this was something he meant - I'm a stubborn control freak who will make contact without a proper apology over my cold dead fuckin body. If I'm expected to dismiss this as a meaningless drunken tantrum, I'd feel bad for having not tried to reach out first to see if he's feeling any better.

Idk. I am the most confused I've been in a long time over this. Fuckin bewildering. Someone help me understand this shit.  Is alcohol often the source of seemingly random and unprovoked declarations of personal hatred like this? And how tf is one to respond?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5071674}"
2020-12-22 05:12:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ki2m44/yeah_ok_i_get_it_now/,"Yeah ok, I get it now","Ya know, I used to think that resorting to alcohol during times of stress was just a silly weakness that some people resort to but I’ve figured out that it’s much more profound, and frankly it makes total sense.

Stress can be a result of pushing people away, both purposely and incidentally. This may or may not be a result of alcohol but that’s irrelevant. Taking to the drink during times of stress isn’t purely for the sake of numbing your emotions or zonking out to ignore your problems. It is the manifestation of a good friend who will stick by you during times of loneliness or times when you feel like the whole world is against you. You actually becomes friends with yourself. You laugh at your own thoughts as if you were thinking out loud at the pub and your buddy just caught wind of that hilarious whim you just thought of. And, it’s immediate. You don’t have to break it down and explain explicitly what you mean, your buddy will get you straight away.

It’s so much easier drinking with your buddy and creating other new peers because you don’t have to get dressed up, you don’t have to commute anywhere, there’s no need to make plans and it doesn’t cost a cent over retail store liquor prices and your best buddy and newfound peers will find everything you say really, really funny, just as funny as you think it is and that’s really enjoyable, it’s just great. It’s actually a great affirmation of your own inner confidence. You may even post something on Reddit and your buddies will all agree that it’s really a brilliant thing to share.

You’ll develop a bond with these buddies of yours - They get you. You want to stay close to them given how great they’ve been to you. They are a projection of your perfect friendship circle that you’re really glad to have in your life. Never once do they judge you for taking another swig of the bottle or any of the other things that your real-life friends would point out as weird or something for you to think about. No, you are aware of those things but you just need some bliss because real-life completely sucks and ignorance is bliss, so fuck off.

These buddies of yours may or may be devils themselves but that’s also largely irrelevant. They will all go one-to-one with you during shots because they are you - They’re taking a swig every time you do. Naturally, you don’t need to feel as though they’re slacking off because they’re not drinking, they’re drinking the same thing you are, and they’re as wasted as you are, passing out exactly when you do. A perfect friendship, really. You wish you could go to brunch the next day and recall all the hilarious things you went through the night before but it’s not to be because they’re not around. You have to wake up and deal with real-life and it is full of so much shit that you can’t wait to get back to hanging out with your buddies, at your favourite pub, with the kind of music you all like, perfectly comfortable, joking around, living it up.

People in real-life will make you do things you don’t think are worthwhile doing because they’re usually not. You have to consider people’s emotions and sensitivities and if you were to break out just once and tell Tess that her scarf looks like a menstrual byproduct, instead of your buddies bursting out with laughter, you’ll get an email from HR, get some bullshit lecture and that’s plainly nonsense. If your ex-girlfriend is posting photos of herself with groups of friends at a bar, having a good time and maybe sleeping with that guy she’s next to, that requires some ignorance and please, for the love of God, some bliss, because I can’t sit here by myself waiting for the hours to tick over before having to go to work again to attend a job I couldn’t care less about just for the sake of paying my goddamn water and internet bills, watching life go by while it dildo’es me in the ass.

I just wanna go back to my friends and have my own thoughts and feeling re-affirmed. Who would want negativity or self-doubt swirling around naturally in their minds? It just doesn't make sense to me. Oh sure, you could be some majestic hero on a white horse who deals with all of real-life's problems head-on and resolves all of them with substance-free valour but is that honestly realistic? Honestly? I really don't see it happening. And as for being a halfway accomplished everyman, what's even the point of that? How could you be content being the most average of average and putting all that energy (a shitload of energy) into just being middle ground when you've got all your buddies waiting for you at the mind pub, ready for you to share your thoughts and send you to king-dom?

I'll try to keep things concise because this is supposed to be a quick question to verify something (unfortunately it probably will get too long).  
  
So I kinda like this girl, and I believe she likes me at least a little bit (enough to want to do stuff with me). But since she turned 21 she became much more distant, and spends a lot of her time out drinking. It doesn't help that the restaurant she works at has a bar, where she usually has a drink after each shift (I think).  
  
Enough exposition, you get the idea. Here's what happened today. She asked me what my plans were today, which were nothing. Usually I take this as her way of saying she wants to hang out, so I eventually get to suggesting that and she agrees. But as I'm suggesting what we could do today she makes multiple vague excuses: ""I have no energy today"", ""my hair's wet from showering"", ""I don't have clean clothes"". I couldn't put 2 and 2 together in the moment.  
  
In response to ""I feel like crap today"" I asked if she drank a lot last night. She opened up a little and said she was upset and was sorry because she knew I didn't like when she drank (surprised she knew that tbh, I never told her explicitly). I tried my best to encourage her that she's capable of quitting and that she was already ahead for knowing there was a problem, and that little conversation ended.  
  
After that she asked *me* about places we could go tonight but ultimately after awkward ""date plans"" over snapchat she said she felt too down to do anything tonight and that she wanted to ""stay in"". I told her I understood and was okay with that, but then she appeared to go out an hour later (based on the background of the selfies she sent). I felt kinda betrayed. **If she had other important plans she would've said so instead of being all vague.** It seems obvious to me that she went out to drink. I haven't addressed this to her.  
  
I really can't make sense of how *she* feels about me. I know this isn't a dating sub but I have closely related questions about alcoholism. **Is the need for alcohol really that strong?** Strong enough to have a conversation about it with your sober friend, make plans with them, only to flake out to go drink? Again, I have no experience with alcohol or understanding alcoholism. I can't relate so it seems so bizarre that someone would do that.  
  
I just want to help her. I feel like we have a connection but alcohol is getting in the way of that. Even if she doesn't like me romantically it feels wrong to let this continue, because as things are I don't see her recovering on her own.

I feel fantastic. I'm stronger, my anxiety is infinitely lower, the people who love me are happy and grateful, I'm hopeful for the future, I sleep like a normal person... The list goes on and on.

I can be a bit obsessive. I think that this drive for perfection is what caused me to drink. When I was drunk I could just not care about anything or anyone. Yet, all of the typical problems arose and I've been working on sobriety for a bit over a year. I am not perfect and I no longer strive for perfection, but I'll admit some habits die hard. 

&#x200B;

And so, I bring to you a google sheet to look at + critique. Originally, I started this sheet for myself to keep track of the all of the zoom meetings I liked. Then I had an idea to edit my sheet and the obsessive part of my brain was off to learn everything there was about google sheets. Since I only started yesterday, I'll admit there is surely room for improvement and that's where you come in! I've made this resource as a way to keep track of your sobriety and provide you with something personal for you to track digitally. 

&#x200B;

We still have a long way to go before we can do face to face meetings again, at least for me anyway.(Thanks Tennessee) So this sheet helps me keep all of my virtual meeting info/resources in one place. Like many of you, I'm currently working from home and look at a computer all of the time so this works better than a handwritten alternative, for me. 

&#x200B;

All that to say, [check it out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMbc83dLmrDVbo5iUxDEO1nJ3Au2JLvC-3iD9jzaJCo/edit?usp=sharing), make a copy for yourself, and [tell me what you think](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpLiLURaeMqE7PNF9mOdRT3srK9HooVxI3IPyeczd7ZWDTwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)! I'd love to create an even more comprehensive sheet for the broader community! I'll admit I was inspired to make this sheet and share it on reddit because of another redditor that did something similar in r/personalfinance. This sheet includes tabs for a weekly plan, resources, milestone counter, meeting list & phone list. 

&#x200B;

Another thing, my personal program is AA, though I'd like this sheet to work for anyone's program. Feel free to use the feedback form linked above to leave me your thoughts. I hope you find this resource helpful!

I appreciate all of you for looking if you do.

So on November 11th, my mother had an emergency Aortic Dissection, and is still in the ICU recovering. Since this happened, I have been living at my parents’ house 4 or so days a week in order to help dad with the bills, household tasks, etc. He is oxygen-bound because of numerous breathing issues related to some obscure forms of pneumonia he’s battled over the years, COPD, and use of an experimental medicine in the 90s, and although he is only 65, he has definitely aged about 15 years in the last two. 

When this stuff happened with mom, he was unable to visit her at the ICU because he was undergoing at-home treatments for a rare pneumonia; his inability to see her tore him apart on the inside. Because of this, he took to drinking quite heavily - a handle of Tequila will last him about 40 hours if lucky - and I am finding it obscenely difficult to deal with. He isn’t rude or abusive, he is just a total shell of a man, and it is so unlike the strong, proud figure who has been one of my absolute closest friends my whole life.  

Several hundred dollars on tequila later, and I find myself here helping him decorate for the coming holiday. I love my father more than anyone, but I feel like the person who raised me isn’t even there anymore, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult bot to find myself resenting whoever he has become. I (28M) would rarely ever drink myself, and since seeing this happen to my father I’ve committed to being a teetotaler. 

Is there anything I can do? Despite everything, mom is making slow progress, and I was hoping to see his drinking drop off, but there has been no indication of this happening anytime soon. I refuse to become a caregiver once mom is out of the ICU, so I’m unsure of where to even look for supportive (affordable) services.

I suppose in the end, I just wanted to vent a bit! Being burnt out and driving 100+ miles a day is taking a toll.

from 26 to 31, drank heavily almost every day, usually passing out in bed/chair/couch with tv on. Have had periods of sobriety and relapses and efforts to control or limit drinking, but by 33 I had kinda told myself I'd never quit just needed to space it out a few days at a time, ya nkow, for health.

2+ years ago I had a DUI, and due to extreme anxiety, the court process/random testing while working, I cracked and was having to go to the bathroom for an oily bowel movement 8 times a shift. Oily stools generally means your body isnt processing nutrients so I got sicker each day.

 I began to develop random twitching, could be any body part any time (Myoclonus) that are especially bad as I start to fall asleep. A major body jerk (ive literally done full kicks a couple of times. its called a hypnic jerk or hypnagogic jerk) will occur as my heart rate lowers, along with the feeling like bumping your humerus nerve (kind of springy, electrical feeling will surge through my brain) It happened over and over for over 20 days, I literally got no sleep at all and was having massive headaches, mood swings, seeing double, etc. I had a nervous breakdown and spent 10 days in a psych facility.

Eventually anxiety grew more, and a brain fog/haze with a low grade headache lasts all day every day. In urine testing I was unable to urinate in front of someone watching, was lucky enough to get a doctors note from psychiatrist so not a probation violation. For two weeks I had a burning sensation in my skin all over my body. It passed then I experienced tenesmus (feeling of having to make bowel movement even when empty) for two weeks, which also passed. Spent a week in jail, and while I was mostly just bored, my anxiety response was having diarrhea the whole stay. Sleep disturbance continues.

Tried many medications over the course of a year, eventually finding Mirtazipine. Was quick dissolve, and got me to sleep I'd say 4 out of 5 times. A side affect is appetite, I gained about 50 lbs. Tried to wean myself off, and I slept decently well, usually 4 hours. After about a year sober, the first 6 months being so Depressed i didnt get out of bed except to eat or go to the bathroom, I began relapsing regularly, eventually it being every third day like clockwork.

2 years after the DUI, the twitching and sleep disturbance grew and grew. It varies by day, is affected by an inner ear disorder (Eustachian Tube Dysfunction) and a jaw/teeth grinding disorder (TMJ/Bruxism) so it is difficult to drive a car some days, but have to drive anyways to make doctor/psych appointments and put others in danger.

I have had the following, all rarely and with no real pattern: vivid, soul shaking nightmares. audio hallucinations (hear something random, like musical note, word or phrase in random voice in left ear) vaso vagal response (entire body goes numb and tingly and you feel like youre going to pass out) Brain zaps so bad (and long) when I try to move it takes 2 seconds for body to comply and am almost convulsing trying to get up, quick sharp pain like stung with a needle in random part of face. Passing out for 1/4 second during the day and head nods (have almost crashed head into bathroom mirror a couple times, especially scary in the shower where you can slip, and on the road driving) Many, many other strange things have happened that I wish I wrote down because memory is shot these days.

As I said, I relapse regularly. With these symptoms it's hard not to. But alcohol doesnt even get me to sleep anymore unless I drink to blackout, and I've discovered recently that my blackouts are no longer half hour/hour but go on and on, and recently I had a text conversation as record of it, I easily lost 5 hours.

With how my anxiety reacted to a work situation, I have been afraid that going back will be a fast track to suicidal ideation, especially with my brain fog, I have no foundation and get confused and scared easily. Ambien is the only thing that gets me to sleep, but taking it regularly, it loses potency so some nights I go without sleep (or have crazy nightmares that fuck up my whole day) I am afraid what I will look like to family and friends as I stammer or trail off in conversation, twitch, and just generally look like someone just ran over my dog.

It's not all bad. I do get out of bed. I regained my sense of humor and do play video games, etc. But so often the brain fog gets so intense my head feels full and I have to lay down, sometimes for hours. The cycle of hypnic jerks waking me as I begin to fall asleep continues.

Lab tests/EKG/EEG/Blood tests etc keep coming back normal, neurologist tests normal, everyone keeps telling me its anxiety, but seems like some kind of psychosis at times (though usually only when trying to sleep)

If you made it this far thanks for reading. I did AA 5 times a week for a year during sentence, dozens of tables, heard many an open talk, never heard anything close to what I'm experiencing. Doctors dont know what to do. Therapists/psych dont know what to do.

For about a year I was suffering from crippling depression and turned to alcohol for relief. Life got even darker very quickly and I promised myself I would never get back to that point. 

Fast forward and I’ve graduated college. I’m staying with my parents while I look for a job. I’m very good at what I do and I’ve had several interviews with firms that I would love to work for. Life is looking up for me in a big way, and that feels really good. 

My problem now seems to be boredom. I’m staying with my parents while I look for a job and I have had nothing to do. I’m working petty jobs just for some spending money and it sucks. I just paid tens of thousands of dollars on my education. It was worth every damn nickel, but I’m frustrated that I’m not doing what I’ve been trained to do—what I worked so hard for.

The days are starting to meld together and I find myself drinking to get shitfaced just because it’s one of the few things I find enjoyable at the moment. I don’t want to have a couple beers and be done. I want the whole damn six pack of some 10% IPA’s or nothing. I definitely don’t mind drinking alone either. 

I want to believe I can get this under control and find a way to drink in moderation, but I’m doubting myself. I have an extremely addictive personality and it’s very hard for me to just have one or two drinks if I have the opportunity to drink more. 

So what I wanted to ask you guys is this:
How much is too much? How do I judge when I’m overstepping with alcohol? Am I kidding myself thinking I can drink in moderation? 

I don’t think it’s destroying my life or having any serious effects on me yet, but I’m concerned about the path I’m on. This just isn’t a fulfilling habit. My drinking is just becoming too regular and I almost always drink to the point that if I have one more I’m gonna be hugging the porcelain. 

I’m not sure if I’m a full fledged alcoholic yet, but I’m certain I will be if I keep this up. It might be time to go to some meetings. I’m open to anything. I know I’m better than this and I’ll do whatever it takes. My life is only just getting started and I want to set the world on fire. I refuse to let a substance get in my way.

Its embarrassing and makes me hate myself. I feel like i am heading into a downward spiral of depression and suicidal thoughts.

I went to her when I was 19 (i am 34 now) and a person I was staying in a hotel room stole my prescription bottle of klonopin and when I tried to refill it she didn't belive me and cut me off. What Do I need to do ? do out of state to get prescribed benz just to  get off this? is that even a possibility? I wake up every morning throwing up I have constant shakes and shivers, fevers, the entire shebang.

I won't drink more as it makes me sick, this is just a nice way to be sure i will be sleeping well. I would like to stop, or at least cut back a lot, but I can't seem to find the motivation. I stopped for 3 days for the first time this week, and it was totally fine, so on the third night I bought a bottle to reward me I guess. Thing is, alcohol has not had much negative impact on my life. I got a good job in January, am buying an appartment, i live alone so i'm not disturbing anyone. I am mostly worried about my health, but it doesn't seem to be enough to convince me very long. When I stopped i was happy because of the things I could do in the evenings, instead of just drinking and watching Netflix, but it is so hard to keep this way of thinking.

I was dating someone and we fed off eachother's addictive habits, it was boozing every night and coke and molly when we had some extra cash or someone else showed up.

My partner ended up going to the hospital with pancreatitis, and was in there for nearly a month. I don't remember any problems with dt's or sleep or anything during that time, perhaps I was too scared and upset that it just exhausted and numbed me to everything else.

We split up for awhile, got back together right at that beginning of covid and proceeded to get back into boozin' heavily, because what else could we do? We decided to stop at some point after some dumb fight, and it was DT's hard, that's when I googled all about them and what was happening to me- why i was anxious and my hands started shaking so hard I couldn't eat anything that required a spoon. Barely a fork. That just pushed me more toward quitting, I hated the feeling that my body wasn't under my control.

The worst was on day 4 of being sober, I hadn't slept at all because I had this weird twitch that would only occur as soon as I drifted off. And I mean like as soon as I did, twitch, no sleep for you. If I am awake 36-48 hours just for whatever reason, studying or just didn't get a chance I am already very anxious and not thinking straight. 

By day 4 with no sleep I was shakey hands, but my anxiety was through the room. And when I tried to sleep, everything would turn into a song. That fan is now some random classic rock song I heard once, or mambo #5. Usually just the course too, on repeat, it was maddening- so I was in the middle of a full blown panic attack and made my friend take me to an urgent care. 

urgent care was insisting I go to the ER and I was insisting since covid I've got no insurance and barely any money. Eventually a doctor comes in and lectures me on drinking so much, takes my vitals, gives me a paper with the essential vitamins and nutrition I am probably lacking - (WHICH I LOST IF ANYONE HAS THIS INFO) after asking multiple times about the inability to sleep, he gave me a couple ativans, i want to say 5 x 2mg. He will stop the twitching and allow me to sleep. I went straight home, took 1 every 45 minutes till I could sleep (took 3) that first night, and 1 the next two nights. Beautiful sleep.

The reason I am making this post is because my bestfriend and I are both suddenly single and we have drinking entirely too much. I didn't really experience anything bad this time quitting after the first day, i had such a strong pain in my stomach I thought it was pancreatitis like my ex, but it went away not long after. Some hand shaking but not much, and no twitching at night- but at least when I was twitching it felt like I COULD doze off. I've tried melatonin, meditation, reading, exercising, eating right before bed, eating way before bed, advil pm. This is now the morning of day 5 with no sleep. 

Sad to say I just got back from the store with a bottle of vodka. I'm hoping by the time I finish writing this and drink some shots I will be able to sleep. And then I guess keep a night time bottle and slowly ween off? I was tempted to just wait and go to the urgent care again when they open and see if they could give me ativan again but my eyes are so solidly red from being awake this long, I look and feel insane. I took a bath with my eyes open under water hoping to hydrate them. Plus it's not even twitching keeping me awake. I was embarrassed to go into the gas station just now. Only a couple people in my circle know but it's probably starting to become apparent, one offered me xanax but i read that could cause the opposite and i'd be more awake. i hate ambien and still that requires $200 doctor visit and however much those cost.

tldr- I just want to not need booze to sleep. it's driving me insane. Did you ever experience this, how did you get passed it?",2,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.756038}"

So here's some background: my dad has been in and out of the hospital since July from chronic sciatica and alcoholism. He went through DTS and honestly I'm surprised he survived because he also has afib and he's prediabetic. Anyways, he tried rehab in August, but ended up back in the hospital for throwing his back out. Never finished his stay, but I thought things were looking up. From what I could tell, he stopped drinking and he seemed like he was in good spirits. In October, my dad left Florida to be closer to my husband and I.  We thought this move would be a positive change. From the moment we picked him up, it's been a mess. He could hardly walk and was in pain all the time. Since he's been in his new place, he's been in and out of doctor's offices for his back problems, so now he's confined to a wheelchair. He was also taken off really heavy pain meds because of his substance abuse with alcohol and is on lower grade meds.

Right around the election he relapsed. We were so concerned we called an ambulance for him. The next day, after he was released, he promised to get treatment. He started going outpatient treatment and since then everything has been fine. 

However this week he's been in a lot of pain. Yesterday when I took him to get his MRI for his back, he fell. Although he didn't fall from being drunk (usually I can tell when he's not sober) my husband and I knew something was off. We could hear it in his voice when we spoke to him later last night and today, but we weren't entirely sure. Tonight we went over to his place to take his trash out and wash a couple of dishes for him. He was already in bed, but was talking to us from his bedroom. I just knew something was up so I told my husband to start checking different nooks and crannies and he found 11 bottles of vodka and wine, and 1 vodka bottle that was almost finished. I absolutely lost it. I cried and yelled at him. My husband yelled at him. I told him he was choosing alcohol over me. I feel awful because I don't know what to do. We both feel really bad for yelling at him, but we were so blinded with anger and sadness. I called the addiction center where he's getting his treatment to let them know the situation. I'm absolutely heartbroken and I'm at my wit's end. My mom passed from alcoholism nearly 8 years ago. I don't even know if my dad is going to live to see me turn 30, let alone see his future grandchildren. I just don't know what to do.

TL;DR Dad with serious health issues relapsed for the second time since moving up near my husband and me.

2020-12-17 23:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/kfe0tm/one_month_sober/,One month sober.,"Hey. I made it to a month, finally. Finally I can stop feeling ashamed of myself. I just want to talk about it if you guys don't mind. It'll be long and it's not actually important. 

I'm a fairly recent alcoholic. Or at least I discovered I was an alcoholic recently, depending on how you think of alcoholism. I started drinking too much in March during lockdown, as I'm sure a lot of people did, but it got to the point where I was having 6-7 drinks a day on average and getting drunk every other day. It was wonderful. Even a single drink in my system made the day better. And nothing in the world is tastier than beer and whiskey. I was loving being drunk. It made streaming more fun, it made games more fun, it made just sitting alone in my room and writing or listening to music more fun. I've even written some of my favourite recent pieces of writing when drunk (editing while sober the next day).

But I was also regularly embarrassing myself at games nights and worrying my friends about how much I drank. I was spending a lot of money and packing on weight. I was feeling shame by the end because I had half-heartedly tried to quit so many times and just cut myself endless slack and say ""well, I already failed today by having a drink, why not get drunk?"" I didn't get angry or argumentative or anything, and I certainly never got violent. I just enjoyed myself, but my emotions were too close to the surface and I have a selfish tendency that I bury as deep as I can that comes out when I'm drunk, and I'd sometimes take things personally when drunk that I wouldn't sober.

Finally, after one particular incident where I was insensitive to a friend in a way I wouldn't have been otherwise, I decided I had to quit without cutting myself any slack. What I did was nothing truly horrible and would take too long to explain, but it wasn't how I wanted to be. I don't want to offhandedly hurt my friends' feelings and then expect them to keep forgiving me. Better to stop while I haven't alienated any friends. Better to stop when I could still stop without help.

And so I decided there would no more attempts to moderate. I can't be trusted to moderate. No more ""only on special occasions"" or ""only on weekends"", because if I give myself and inch I'll always take a mile. Now I'm quitting for a year without a sip until then. I understand if this is a sticking point for some, and it's possible alcoholics should simply have none forever, but I'll have to find out for myself if alcoholism is a thing I lose or not. If not, then I have to quit for good. 

But either way, a year. I cannot fail. And so far it has been so much easier. Once I shut the metaphorical gates against any option to have any at all, and once I told all the people close to me what I was doing, and once I got the support from some of the people I hurt in that last incident, failure became impossible.

The headaches lasted a week, the cravings are still there. But I'm not worried about starting again. I'm feeling pretty free. I'm not free, mind you. I want to drink all the time, and that hasn't stopped. And maybe next month will be worse, I have no idea. I'll never let my guard down about it, because if I allow myself to go ""you've proven you're not an alcoholic. You can have a drink now"" and fall for it, it's over. But I'm feeling confident, and I'm very happy. Instead of being ashamed of myself every day (from waking up and deciding not to drink that day but inevitably going to the liquor store anyway), I'm a little proud of myself every day.

It all started with trying wine back in April, and I quickly realized that I really liked the stuff. Then I suddenly discovered hard liquor sometime at the end of the summer.

Pregame at home (and drinking at theirs if the others do it)

I have no physical addiction and I never get blackout drunk or to the point of slurred speech or losing my balance. And I never do or say anything I'm ashamed of the day after. So I haven't really experienced any negative side effects yet. At house parties I'm never the first to leave but never in the last group either, firmly middle of the pack.

I never drink at or before work (I've done it before every interview I ever had though and have always done very well in those, again, cheating).

It started from his time in the military and has only progressed throughout his life. Over the last 5 or so years it got out of control and he was becoming less functional, hiding drinks, starting drinking at 6am etc. In a normal day he would consume a minimum of two bottles of 14% wine, a few pints of beer and often some chasers. My mother and I had tried to talk to him about his drinking on multiple occasions, but it was very difficult as he refused to acknowledge that he was an alcoholic and however we approached it he would always view it as an attack. Over the last couple of years in particular I withdrew from him quite a bit as he was no longer the man I remembered, and I felt there was no way that I could help him, he had to come to that decision himself.  


This year, with Covid and the associated lockdowns starting in March his drinking went up another gear, and by mid April he had a health crisis. He had terrible abdominal pain and was rushed to hospital where he spent a few nights dealing with both withdrawal symptoms as well as being diagnosed with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The doctor told him that he should not drink again, as any drinking would risk a flair up and another bout of acute pancreatitis, or in the worse case lead to chronic pancreatitis, which would leave him in pain for the rest of his life. He was completely out of it for the first week spending most of his time in a lucid state. Over time he started to recover his strength, and although he asked for alcohol in the first week or two of his recovery at home, we refused and he was in no shape to acquire it himself, so he had nothing to drink. He decided himself that he would follow the doctors advice, and during his recovery he has not had a drink for 8 months (aside from non-alcoholic beers). He is back to the man I used to know, and for the last few months has been in better physical and mental shape than he has been in years.  


This brings me to the main point of this post. Christmas. It was always a time of year where he drank the most and he clearly has strong associations with this time of year and over-indulging. Coming back from doing the shopping last week I noticed that he had bought a bottle of wine, and I asked him very calmly about it, and he stated that he just wanted to have one glass when we put the Christmas lights up, and when I asked about the rest of the bottle he said he would probably have it over Christmas, but he wasn't going to start drinking ""properly"" again. This concerned me as I have witnessed similar behaviour before when he was trying to cut down, and as soon as he lets the reins slip a bit, it seems very easy for him to fall back into old habits. Today my Father, Mother and I went out to a Christmas lunch and he said on the way there that he wanted to have a glass of wine with the meal. I again tried as calmly as possible to suggest that it seems like a risk to both his health, and as a temptation back into drinking. He did not take this well and said that he felt we were restricting his freedom, which really feels like a step back to his old attitude. He ended up not having a drink, but the atmosphere for the entire meal was tense and it was clear that he had been thinking about having a drink today for a while.  


So, from my perspective I believe it is best if he stays away from alcohol completely, both for his physical health and general quality of life (not to mention my mother's quality of life). However, putting this across to him in a way which he doesn't feel is an attack or accusation is incredibly difficult. I'm also torn, because I believe that he has to be free to make the decision himself, and in no way should I try to impose abstention on him.

He is in his early 30s and drinks 3/4 of a whole bottle of whiskey/vodka every night and it is getting concerning. Some nights he finishes a whole bottle. He has always been someone that liked to drink on the weekends but now it has evolved into every night. My other friend and I have talked about it to each other and have even brought it up to him but he tries to downplay it and gets in an upset mood by saying we are overreacting. He does it so often he forgets conversations we've had in the same week and his awareness is clearly taking a dive. It gets incredibly frustrating when he gets into discord with us and is already hammered. He even brags about how much he can drink over us without getting a hangover like it is some achievement.

We haven't done a full-blown intervention yet but that honestly is because we have no idea how to approach this. His response to why he drinks so much is because it makes his life more ""enjoyable"" which is clearly a crutch for him being unhappy. It's not fun hanging out with him anymore because he always wants to drink and it constantly reminds us of his problems. We even stopped inviting him to hangouts where alcohol is involved to not influence him more. He also lives with his girlfriend who also doesn't help. She buys him alcohol all the time because it makes him a happier person and doesn't think it's an issue. She herself is starting to drink every night with him too.

It just seems like a hard task to deal with because if we can't get him to stop then we don't want to be friends with him but that also means he will have fewer people in his life trying to help him. Any tips on how to go about this?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7461123}"

I’ve been experimenting with different beverages and tried Kombucha. The stuff I got before was sugar free and I never worried about potential alcohol since it advertised itself as alcohol free and I never felt anything after drinking it.

So a few weeks ago I got a bottle of Kombucha from Waitrose as a treat, a brand I’d never tried before. I finally drank it last night and had a weird moment when about half an hour later I realised I felt tipsy. It was so confusing at first because it’s been so long it was like ‘I know this feeling, what’s happened?’. I checked the bottle and it said it contained a ‘trace’ which apparently was enough to have an effect.

It was like being flooded with all these feelings. I felt said like I’d ruined something but I also wanted more of it. I started trying to plan how to sneak out and get actual alcohol. I also felt less aware of myself but at the same time more down on myself. 

The rest of the evening was uneventful and I didn’t try to get anything (I’m too close to 100 days to do it).

I know this might seem like nothing, but it's big for me. If you read my post history, you may well see that I've made several quit attempts before, and always relapsed after a couple of days. 

Last week, I ended up in the emergency room with desperate shortness of breath and chest pains, and I spilled the beans to the doctor on my drinking habits. She pretty much told me what I already knew - this was all down to drinking, and I was approaching my last chance to get off it. For some reason, the warning hit home this time.

So what did I do? I quit cold turkey, overnight. NOT the recommended thing to do when you were previously getting through a bottle of vodka a day. I felt sick as a dog and scared out of my mind the first couple of days, but other than that, I got lucky. Nothing really happened. Likely since I was given some diazepam to keep withdrawals at bay. 

This is officially the longest I've gone without drinking in about 15 years. So how do I feel now? Well, the past week has been rough. It started out as intense nausea, fever, shaking, sweating, shortness of breath, vomiting, vertigo, the works. I plowed through, though, and it let up by about day 3. Then the fun started with my legs. They went numb. My feet were EXCRUCIATING to walk on, and I was basically crippled. This went on for about 3 more days, and I was seriously tempted to give in and drink again as I knew it would make the pain go away. In the past, I would have done. Not this time.

So here I am, day 8, and the pain is finally starting to ease up. I can walk again (with some discomfort), and best of all, I can \*sleep\* again. How do I feel? I feel great. I feel alive.

It's going to be a long road ahead yet, and that temptation will probably never go away, but my sister gave me a quote that inspired me:

""Every day, in every way, I am getting better"".

\*Raises Diet Coke\* Here's to second chances at a future.

With the continuing help of my AA group and my family, I'm determined to keep hitting milestones, one day at a time.

I’m not going to write too much of a backstory.

Basically been drinking since 16, mostly beer.
Around 24 it became mostly spirits, I have a good life (loving wife and son) ended up with complete jaundice almost over night. First noticed it in my eyes, woke up one morning more yellow than a Simpson’s character. Ended up in the hospital, not willingly mind you. Vodka daily, for years (covid didn’t help and upped my intake to about 750ml + beer couldn’t say how much but at least 48 oz) 

At any rate I’m writing this begging people to stop, I ended up with a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. Ammonia was through the roof as was bilirubin. Spent about a week and a half there, with a %25 chance of survival. Had to learn how to walk, write, basically everything again. Sober 3 months and went back to the bottle. Last labs are showing that I will likely end up with cirrhosis. No one to blame but myself, I don’t know how to stop, I get a strange sensation in my brain, likely over stimulation everytime I try to cut back, even if I’m drinking I begin withdrawal, I’m back at it and likely to kill myself, seizures everynight. 


TLDR please don’t end up like me. I beg to be sober at this point but I can’t go on without booze and refuse hospitalization due to covid.

I've had a best friend that I've known since we were little kids (almost 50 years).  We've always stayed in contact, but we live in different states.  My friend has been going through a hard time over the past few years.  He was fired from his job, increased his drinking to the point of dependence, and he's in a miserable family situation.  He's been in this situation for several years now.

I spoke with him and I want to help him get a fresh start/reboot on things by bringing him up to live with me for several months.  My friend is wanting to change things and work on recovery.  He's going to live with my family, see how we live, eat better, get in shape, etc. 

He'll have more structure here, no shaming or verbal attacks, and all the support that we can provide.  What I'd like your advice on is things that he can do during the day.  I'm looking for constructive activities that he can do, at his own pace, to make the most of his time.  This could be creative projects, therapy, AA meetings, job training, etc.  If any of you here that have struggled with abuse and could go live a different life for a while, what would you find rewarding or fulfilling?  I know everyone is different, but I'm just looking for ideas and he'll ultimately do what he prefers.  Again, no high expectations or punishments for not following some boot camp style schedule.  That's not the idea.  Just positive alternatives to gaming/drinking all night and sleeping all day.

I'm trying to help him to avoid being bored, or watching TV/gaming all day, etc.  I'd rather he work on things that produce results, or builds positive momentum.  This schedule would be something similar to business hours and he would still have time to relax and unwind.  We live pretty far out and there's not much near by.  He won't be driving and won't be able to go anywhere without us.

I'm not looking for all of the things that could go wrong with this plan.  I'm a pretty pessimistic person by nature and I've been imagining all of the things that can go wrong with this.  I'm just trying to give him a safe, healthy place to live for a while, so he can focus on getting better and improving his situation in life.  No judgement for slip-ups or bad days.  No anger, guilt, or shame.

First off, I will make this as concise as I can , as we are all busy and dealing with our own things. Okay, my father is an alcoholic, but functioning and has had a cocaine problem for many years.

To describe the frequency of my use I would say I use it on average every 2 months. I’m not addicted to cocaine, but we talk about it a lot. And I enjoy it when I do it, but I don’t feel under its control. I’m just a bit worried , because I was talking to my best friend about it and we both agreed we need to stop, because we used it twice in the past 2 months. I have dreamed about cocaine more than once, however we only use it when it’s a big occasion, like someone leaving for a couple months, or a birthday party. So I ask again, am I an addict?

I got ready for work and then got an alert there was an accident on the freeway.

Then work was just so shitty all day. I’m an in home healthcare provider and my clients were just slave driving me yesterday and coming up with the worst tasks for me to do. At one point I was literally scraping shit off of a bed pad and I was wondering where it all went wrong in my life lol. 

I made it through my ten hour day on a banana and a cliff bar, and finally made it home. Even my husband was like dude if you want to have a couple drinks it’s fine, go for it, you had a rough day.

Then one day realize I went back to drinking everyday and binge drinking. It is then followed by a depression, anxiety and fatigue. I was functioning but lacking energy to get things done well. 

So after hitting my rock bottom three times I started wondering if I ever will be able to fight my addiction and prevail as it felt so overwhelming. I thought I'll never learn anything from those relapses and will just keep falling for any poor excuse I have to start drinking again. But that's over now! This time I will keep every thing in mind when it comes to my drinking, I will remember every dirty little thought that lead me to relapsing before and I am well aware of the pitfalls on my way now.

I am just very happy to feel this way - very motivated but also very aware. Hope you guys start the new year with the same attitude and a good mood :)

I have been with my fiancé for let’s say 2 years. He is great and we have tons in common. However, my fiancé had a crippling addiction to booze. 
When we got together and I noticed, I told him I wasn’t okay with it, and to my surprise he went sober. He has continued to relapse over and over again. He will maintain sobriety, but will usually inevitably drink. He seemingly progresses to set himself back by drinking. Which in turn has set me back. To the naked eye, it seems like when things are going okay is usually when the drinking starts. Only recently have I noticed the true toll it has on me. We haven’t accomplished anything, and he won’t go to any sort of support group because he doesn’t like the religious aspects of AA. 
When he gets drunk he is a completely different person. He screams, yells, becomes overtly sexual with people who don’t feel the same, and is a total asshole. He says things that cut really deep, and will just keep going until he has made his point. He enjoys using information that is confined in him, and based off of trauma and insecurities to use against me. 
He really hurts me because I have a lot of issues with mental illness and trauma. 
After ruining things, he then wakes up and acts like the day is brand new. Never ever really takes into consideration WHAT he said. As if being drunk gives him a pass. He has even stated that when he says these things he doesn’t mean them because he is drunk. 
He has messed up all our living situations and blames me. I for a while was very dependent on him just because he still some how managed to make me  feel loved, but I realize that he isn’t making much progress any longer. He also is making me self conscious, and question my own sanity. He called me names, and tells me to die. 
Recently, I left from a friends house because he got drunk and started shouting and yelling about how he wished death on me and the usual bullshit. I had to get to another friends house which I had to uber myself there. The next day, my mom called me and told me she received startling texts of him asking to fuck her... I saw the messages. I have no relationship with my mom by the way. 
I was really upset. In fact, I am not a perfect person but I have done a lot for him. Bought him clothes and even got him tickets to see the Eagles. I have tried to emotionally be there and also aid him in possibly maintaining a healthy life style. I try my hardest, but it seems like I’m holding us both up. I ask myself why? He doesn’t seem to care about what he does to me. He wants to get married, but that has already come to an end. We are still talking, but I can’t see myself getting back with him or even seeing him face to face. Our chats are small. I can tell he sees his actions are not doing us any good, but J don’t think I can stomach being there for him... or being there at all. I’m worried about him, but I really want nothing to do with him at the same time. Anyway, he told me he wanted to get under my skin with the messages, but I am not buying it. My family is super invasive and gossips a lot. Everyone knows and it’s embarrassing. I feel bad that he has relapsed because I do care, but I don’t want to be with him anymore. I am trying to get my PHD and he has become rude and is stagnating himself and me as well. I want to hear what your opinions are.
I have already pretty much made it clear we aren’t together, and I have read a lot of accounts of men saying their partners leave them to alcoholism and relapsed. There are usually a lot of guys saying the woman wasn’t worth it... but what about all the small things and huge things that take a role on our mental health too? What about the time and effort we put into trying to be there, just to be verbally assaulted. For him it’s like he is having the time of his life drunk, for me? I’m in Hell.

Anyways, I am 29M and prior to this sober streak had been a heavy drinker for the last decade plus. It started when I was a teenager and we would steal booze from parents/buy from friends and escalated into college where I was going to class drunk, day drinking and more of the same through school - frequently drinking to excess was almost an honorable activity and a hell of a lot of fun. Fortunately, I was able to graduate and find employment eventually starting my own business and getting married. The whole time being a fairly functional alcoholic. 

With starting my own business I had a lot of autonomy which lead to more boozing and before long it was getting objectively bad. Starting to drink in the a.m. when I woke up, working more often drunk then sober and more or less being drunk for any and all meaningful events in life.  Tried getting sober a few times and failed, also started to lie about my drinking to hide it from friends and family. 

Black out was no longer some ominous occasional state of being but a new normal. My life was a hazy existence where life revolved around getting blitzed to forget problems only to have those problems amplify once it wore off just in time to restart the cycle. 

Eventually I couldn't handle it anymore and decided enough was enough. Hangovers were the norm, I was always a frazzled mess and missed functions constantly, I had nonstop depression and anxiety and the only time I had motivation was when I was drinking. 

I got into an outpatient (discreet) treatment program and started on medication to prevent drinking (antabuse). In addition, I took a long look at life and what mattered the most to me, what my goals were and how to achieve them. Now I have been sober since June and plan to stay that way.

More or less I came here to say it is possible and life is a lot better sober. The thing that really got me is when I was drunk I would always ""imagine"" my future and these things I wanted to do and it always involved me not drinking. I would always have this - ""sometime in the future when I am sober"" I will do this or that... and it never happened. After 3 years of thinking like that I finally made the change and have been so grateful I did. If anyone wants to know more about what works for me on this journey just ask, I would love to be of help to anyone in a similar situation.

but even with that knowledge today is hard. for some reason i would drink right now if i could. and i don't miss the casual drink with friends or going to bars and parties. i miss being blacked out for days on end. i miss the total oblivion the book talks about. i miss being so gone that people just stop talking to me. i miss not having to think or feel. i miss having the option to check out from reality from time to time. 

for context, i have ptsd--i won't go into the details but my trauma history goes back to 15 and i am 29 now. i remember suppressing my emotions for the first time at 15 and thinking it was a cool trick i'd figured out. i remember zoning out and imagining myself hovering above myself and saying, ""this is just a thing i am going through,"" over and over. i thought learning to completely compartmentalize my pain was a good thing and this lived with me into adulthood. i literally have not been able to cry or fully feel sad, outside of short bursts of EXTREME grief and crying spells that last hours, until about 2 days ago. i don't know what has happened but all the sudden my emotions are seeping back in and it is \*weird\* and i \*hate it\*. i know that this is a sign of healing and a good thing, but it still hurts in the meantime and i do not like this and as an alcoholic i want to feel okay right now dammit! i have cried like 4 times in the past 48 hours. mind you, the anniversary of one of my best friends suddenly dying of a heroin overdose is coming up, but still.

Reminiscing about wedding planning for the past 3 yrs when it was ripped away 4 days before the pandemic hit. 2 months away from our exciting day we worked so hard together for.

Tried to run but knees are blown. Looking in the mirror with disgust not recognizing myself. Partner is overwhelmed working at the hospital while I sit here worried, angry, and frustrated with everything and everyone. Just drink, you’ll feel better. And I did, everyday. White claws and/or vodka until I felt buzzed enough to deal and on some days really drank away everything until I just felt good even if I was bored. 

Alcohol had been my best friend throughout this entire thing. But I know it’s also my worst enemy and it isn’t healthy. I want to be better. This is thee worst time to try to stop. But I feel like anytime is a bad time to stop something that makes you feel good. I feel every emotion. Everything. Even past traumas rehashing and replaying out in my mind. Yes, I’m feeling benefits: sleeping earlier, more rested, waking up earlier, not feeling all swollen, not feeling like my organs are crying, eating healthier, feeling proud. But SO bored and feeling almost hopeless with how and when to start the next chapter in life because of this pandemic and people’s stupidity perpetuating it. Hopeless with myself and how I’ll ever be able to get my body back, and live my life and deal with my anxiety without wanting to drink about it. Trying to remember how I ever did. How anything will ever be enjoyable again and when that will even be. I’m really having a hard time today :,(

Divorce, kids gone, started drinking a little, then a lot, then every day. Got up to a fifth of vodka per day, 30 beers a day, some times 40. One week I drank 2 fifths a day and ended up in the hospital for 8 days. Went to the hospital actually about a dozen times in 1.5 years.  Basically every month. One time my BAC was .40. Should've been dead. Drinking eventually got me arrested too. One time I passed out alongside a highway. One time I passed out in the gutter near my old house. One time I destroyed my TV and Playstation in a fit of rage, by slamming my head into them multiple times. I had the cops called on me about once a month for various reasons, usually because I was yelling at no one or falling down and breaking things in my apartment. Also threw up blood twice. Both times I finished the evening with more beer...I ended up in EPS twice as well because I was telling my mom I wanted to kill myself. I yelled at an officer and told him he doesn't understand my pain. He said I either go inside now or he will throw me in jail. Foreshadowing...I almost got kicked OUT of the hospital because I was so belligerent and kept puffing on my cannabis oil pen. Crazy shit...

After reading this, I hope it shows you that anyone can stop drinking. If I can, so can you. And I'm SO glad to be done. I hated waking up in withdrawal and not having any alcohol to cure it. I hated the daily hangovers that I cured with more alcohol.

I’ll try and keep it as short as possible just giving the highlights. 

I’ve never really thought I had a problem with alcohol. Sure I’d like to enjoy a a couple beers at night at dinner and after. Then maybe two saturdays a month I’d go out with my friends for drinks and dancing. I ended up getting a DUI a few years back. Let’s just say my ex husband was not happy about so my drinking was heavily monitored. Fast forward a few years, things didn’t work out so a divorce happened. 

Now that I was on my own I didn’t feel so trapped so if I wanted a mimosa for breakfast with friends I had it. I wanted a beer (or two) at lunch, I drank it. It didn’t help I worked as a bartender so drinking came with that territory. My boss was a big drinker and always encouraged drinking. 

Dating was not going well for me so I just focused on working as much as I could which lead to the drinking getting more and more each day. I ended up meeting my partner at my bar and come to find out that he is an alcoholic. I never considered myself one but looking back I can now admit that I was. Our drinking continued and got worse each day. I never noticed it in the beginning, we always had such a good time. We were traveling a lot for his job, we never fought, it’s was just amazing to feel free and loved again. 

Somewhere along the way the drinking intensified. Big fights over nothing started happening. And then I was hospitalized for pancreatitis. They told me no more alcohol but I didn’t believe them. So once released I still drank. My first hospitalization was two years ago. Since then I’ve been hospitalized 17 times, been to the ER 6 times for pancreas pain, and 4 surgeries to help fix the issue. 

I’m still with my partner but the fights get more and more violent everyday. I’ve cut back drinking a bit but they have gotten worse. To the point of hiding how much from me. I try and bring it up to talk about it but it gets turned on me saying I’m the reason they drink so much. I’ve learned I just need to bite my tongue. It’s not worth the fights. I’ll deal with all the blame. It’s just hard not being able to sleep and honestly crying a lot. 

There’s more to everything but I just worry I’m going to lose him over this. I’m not saint either. I know when I got blackout I said fucked up shit back to him but I’ve done my best to apologize profusely and make it up to him. I recently moved and don’t have a lot of friends. My best friend is actually an alcoholic but he recently went to rehab and got the help and he is in a good place now that I don’t want to bring this issue up with him because I know he’s still going through ordeal.

Admittedly I might be hypervigilant as I come from a family where quite a few members are alcoholics and I've had my share of trauma related to that. 
I don't think he's an alcoholic (yet) but I think his drinking might be problematic. He rarely drinks during the week but drinks every weekend, regardless of whether we go out or stay in. If we stay in he will have about 6-8 beers on each Friday and Sunday, I only occasionally will have one so mostly he drinks by himself. If he goes out with his friends he'll drink twice this amount with the goal to ""get smashed"". 
It's not only the quantity that worries me but also the attitude he has, i.e. that he likes getting drunk, he misses going to the bars and drinking to oblivion (lockdown), and that he drinks to get drunk, not just buzzed. He also has high resistance, after 6 small beers I can't even tell he's been drinking. We're in the UK and most of his friends drink similar amounts. 
Does this sound normal? We're in our early 30s and most of my friends drink only socially.

My entire life, I've been aware that my parents tend to lose control around alcohol. My mom has gone through stages of admitting she can't have wine in the house, denying anything is wrong, drinking every night, going months without drinking, etc. But she has shown that, if she wants to, she can stop drinking for a while. My dad, however, is a bit different. He never really drank wine but has always drank bourbon. I don't remember it bothering me until I was in high school and noticed that he was slurring and showing other signs of being drunk every single night. From then on my life is a bit of a blur due to my own health struggles, but it's pretty much been a roller coaster of him hiding alcohol, denying he's drinking, me hiding his hidden alcohol, him saying he'll stop, my finding it again, repeat. As far as I know he doesn't drink at work, but everytime he says he's stopped, I find it hidden somewhere. He lies straight to my face and refuses to discuss it. When I try, he gets very angry and I feel like I'm the ""bad guy"" and am trying to stop him from something that gives him stress relief. I have discussed this in therapy for a long time and my therapist never said what to do about it and just danced around it. Last year in family therapy my mom said she would ban alcohol from the house but quickly dropped that rule. When I confronted her, she said that she changed her mind. My dad said the same thing, just in an angrier tone.

Just last month I told him how glad I was that he stopped drinking, only to find out that he's been lying just a day later. I don't know if he's an alcoholic, but he definitely can't stop buying it and drinking for ""stress relief"" and I have expressed just how harmful it is to my wellbeing for years and years and years (I developed a dependency on weed and seeing him drink gives me intense cravings and also makes me feel like he doesn't care enough about me to stop).

I feel like I can't trust him because he's lied to me for so long and I feel like he cares more about his own comfort than me. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm overreacting and he doesn't really have a problem. I don't know. I don't know why it even affects me. I ignore him every day because when he gets home from work he just watches tv and (although he denies it) drinks. But, as stated above, it just floods me with negative emotions.

I guess I'm just ranting or looking for someone to relate to. I feel so stupid.

First time in this sub. I wanted to share my positive experience with others about my drinking habits and weed. First off I've never self-diagnosed or ever bothered to know if I have alcoholic tendencies. However, I did write down my honest drinking habits I've had for the past 6 years. This year in particular my drinking went up. I was drinking about 3-4 times a week alone. Usually a 6-12pk a night. This is when I started noticing I have a problem.

As for weed. I stopped smoking when I was 20 year old (I'm 47) because of a very bad acid trip I had. For about 3 years it made me stop drinking and smoking. lol I just could not enjoy it without having a terrible acid flashback. Now that it's legal I decided to smoke. At first, it was the same thing. The constant shaking and paranoia. I just did not like it at all. A joint lasted me about 6 weeks. Puff here and another one there. Not enjoyable. That was in 2017 when it first became legal in this state. 

I gave it another shot and this time the difference was immediately noticeable. Unbeknownst to me was, I had now purchased Sativa whereas before I was smoking Indica. Sativa gave me a much better high. No anxiety, no shakes, no paranoia like the other kind. 

Next thing I know my cravings for beer were gone. 1 week went by, then 2, then 2 months went by and not a single craving. I would walk down the beer aisle and look at the product and I couldn't help but feel sick just looking at it. I met some friends for our traditional football Sunday drinking day. Usually at a bar/pub.  I have to say it was the first time in a long time drinking felt very unenjoyable for me. I had friends buy me 5 drinks in 9hrs that day because I refused to buy any myself.  I did not like the taste and it was not satisfying for me anymore. It kind of reminded me of my first time in High School when I drank my first beer at a house party. 

TL;DR: Smoking Sativa in small doses helped me get rid of my craving for beer. I've drank 2x since football season started. Before, I was drinking around 3-4x a week, 6-12pk each time. I now smoke daily in small doses.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67557293}"

2020-12-08 15:05:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/k9btzz/an_odd_question_about_sex_drive/,An odd question about sex drive,"So I'm a recovering alcoholic. Used to get drunk daily for almost 10 years and I recently achieved my milestone of 10 days then relapsed, and I'm now making 5 days sober normally. My goal is to quit completely. I'm also taking Librium to help with the withdrawals. 27 male and about 280 lbs. Diet is getting better, I really want to start exercising. I'm breathing better and I'm also sleeping a lot. On the days before I have a day off, I sometimes fall asleep at 7pm and don't wake up until 8-9 am. Other times I have a lot of trouble sleeping and can't fall asleep until nearly 2-4 am and end up waking up at 9 am. It's hard to tell, but mostly I do the former and sleep 12+ hours and only occasionally sleep less than 5 hours.

That was just a little background.

Anyway now that I'm doing better off of alcohol my sex drive has gone way up. I'm constantly noticing other women much more than I have in a long time. I'm not having sex yet, but I'm still doing the deed (you know what I mean). My question is is this normal? Have my hormones been out of whack because of alcohol and now that I'm having more sober days things are firing up again? Any similar experiences? And is this a concern I should mention to my doctor? It would be an awkward conversation but my doctor is a fairly young guy so I think he'd be okay to talk to about it. And will things slow down soon?

And this might be TMI but my normal routine was doing the deed maybe once a week or less, but now it's basically twice a day or twice every two days, sometimes but rarely 3 times in a day.

Again sorry for the odd post but just looking to see if anyone else has experienced this!",21,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49799803}"

I’ve brought it up when she’s sober but she always kind of shrugs it off. It’s like she can’t hear me. I feel like being harsh and confrontational will only drive her to drink more and push me down in importance, so I want to be patient and careful. At the same time... I don’t know what to do. It has to be her who decides to change. So what do I do? Leave? I love her and was excited for our life together. Still would be if she could be sober. 

One thing I’ve seen among the alcoholics I know is that they very often choose alcohol over their relationship. They might remarry later, but I haven’t seen anyone address their issue before the relationship ends. This is what concerns me. I love her and she loves me. But I think she’ll always choose booze. She just gets this weird maniac look even when she’s had just a little bit, and she isn’t honest about how much and when she drinks. It’s so obvious when she’s been drinking though. She has that different look, and her brain can’t form words like normal. They get stuck in her mouth. But she’ll just flat out lie to me and say she’s fine, just tired or whatever. But she’s hammered. 

Her dad is a recovering alcoholic. So’s her mom. Her dad has been sober for most of her life though. I see talking to him as the nuclear option. I’ve confided in my own dad, and he mentioned seeing her do a couple odd things at our last get together. One was sneaking back around and just pouring tequila into an already strong margarita. I guess it looked like she thought no one was looking. That was around the time I noticed I didn’t want to be around her when she drinks. I’ve since stopped drinking with her. I don’t love her alcoholic alter-ego. 

She’s said she wants to drink less. But it sounds like she means it only in a super temporary way. And in the month she took “off,” we had a couple episodes of her being just shitfaced from alcohol she snuck. So I don’t think she can actually be moderate. 

I am sure there’s a fair bit I’m doing wrong still. Help me please. When we’re both sober it’s awesome, our fights are clean and to the point, and we’re growing and making a great life together. Once she’s had any though, I just can’t enjoy being around her",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6397207}"

smoking weed everyday single day with a day off from 15 to 19.
Got addicted to xanax, percs and valium daily from 16 to almost 19. 
I got clean for 4 months and it felt great, those 4 months where amazing because I finally felt free. After such a long shit show of years I finally had 4 month where I didn't feel sad or anxious.

And... now I'm struggling with drinking.
I drank everyday for the last 8 months without a single day off.
I went from half a pint of jack daniels a night to half a pint of 80% moonshine a night to now I'm finally just drinking 4, 7% beers a night.
 
I find quiting drinking is an extreme struggle companies to pills. I want to quit but I'm scared to find out what I'll do to myself since I'm nowheres near in a good position to go sober.

On Reddit so I was surprised by how encouraging this subreddit was. 

Made it the first three weeks without a drink.  Felt awesome. No cravings or headaches. Just genuinely felt awesome. I kept getting messages of encouragement with a common thread attached: “If you fail, don’t beat yourself up.  Just pick up where you left off the next day and move forward.” Didn’t understand it fully until the Monday after week three.  

Had a real shit day at work.  Anxiety on high the entire day and then that anxiety was met with a complete letdown by the end of it.  I was just pissed, super exhausted and just wanted to feel good, as petty as that sounds to actually write down. So I gave myself a “pass” because it was an unusually shitty day and bought my favorite bottle and indulged.  Didn’t kill the bottle, although looking back, I wish I had. Because...

Next day, wake up hungover, mondays shitstorm hasn’t blown over and again, bad day.  Come home to half a bottle of my favorite stuff, I’m tired from sleeping awful the night before, and the half of bottle can’t go to waste and...well you get it. The spiral begins. 

So for about a solid three weeks, I’m just back to my old ways. Not binge drinking every night, but at least two drinks a day and more often than not, three or four.  I honestly just felt pretty shitty that I only made it a few weeks. 

Happy to say that of last Thursday I recalled the messages you guys sent saying don’t beat yourself up.  Just pick up where you left off and move forward. Back on day 3.  Keeping booze out of the house and have promised myself if I ever get in the “I deserve a drink” mentality, I’m going to kick my ass at some physical exercise first as that does well for me in kicking the urge.

She said she wouldn't tell my boss this time, but that if she saw anything again that she would.     
Well, fast forward to today when my boss pulls me aside and says ""Hey, I heard about what happened, I just wanna let you know that you're not in any trouble, we're no strangers to people with addiction problems here. You've talked about your problems with alcohol in the past, and I just wanted to remind you that we're here if you need us.""

I don't know if this is allowed, but just wanted to share my story about how I finally quit alcohol after a 20 year relationship with it myself, following on from a childhood which was blighted by alcoholism in the form of my mother. People need to understand just how dangerous this shit is, it's the only drug from which you can actually die just from the withdrawals. Which I almost did, in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. I was seeing demonic entities trying to get me to go with them and all sorts of other crazy shit. Hopefully this helps someone. I highly recommend Ayahuasca when all else has failed.

Daily drinker for about a year and a half. Used to be beer (6-10 beers) and only at night. About four months ago (maybe even a little more?), I switched to vodka. 6 a day. I planned to taper. Things just escalated. Now I basically drink from 9-12 AM (used to be 2 shots, then 3, now I’m up to 4, 5, sometimes 6), then I go to work at 4 (restaurant doing carry out and delivery).

Knowing all this, is it feasible to taper one shot a day? Will I feel ok-ish? I have two kids so I have to be functional.

This is my first time posting in here. I'm feeling a little lost and confused, and looking for some help. My boyfriend (35/M) and I (34/F) have been dating for a few months, and everything seemed to be going okay, until I found out he suffers from alcoholism. It was a bit of a shocker because he seemed to have everything in order. Until one day he sent some odd texts and dropped off the face of the earth. Later that day I got a text from his best friend asking if I had heard from him that day.... and that's when I found out he had a drinking problem. That he goes through cycles of sobriety and then back slides every now and then. However, this past year has been worse than others.

I ended up going over (we had planned prior to this) that night after work to discover two 1.5 liters bottles of white wine completely empty and a third one full. And when he opened the door looked completely surprised to see me - this wasn't the man I had been dating before. It was a completely different version of him. We chatted for a bit and then I decided to leave him be for a few days, just to give him space. After he sobered up, we chatted (he doesn't remember me visiting when he was drunk) and felt ashamed. I told him I was willing to walk alongside him if he truly wanted to try to get sober. He said he appreciated that and did really well for another week, then he fell off the wagon again. It's been weekly now... this most recent time (today) has been the longest I've seen him drunk. He was finally sober this morning and we had a great chat. Then he ended up talking to his best friend then all of a sudden has to go get more booze. He did tell me his ""best friend"" likes to gloat when he gets drunk again and messes up... not sure if there's any correlation there. 

He's a really great and intelligent guy when he's sober. He's fun, and creative. So much potential. But I feel lost on what to do. There's a part that makes me want to quit because I haven't been together that long. But another part of me that doesn't want to lose faith. He's already gone to rehab, counseling, AA. But he says none of that seems to stick... that his will power isn't that strong.   


Thanks for your help or advice.

I asked, begged her to find other ways to cope the stress, like psychologist, sports, friends circle, manage the life/work balance not to overload herself with work/duties: but no, she drinks every night. My despise towards her also have grown over the years. The problem is that my father was an alcoholic and her drinking makes my flashbacks heavier which in turn makes her drink more. I myself very rarely drink socially and I’m a fan of sports and yoga. We don’t have kids – she’s 37, Im a bit younger, she wants kinds, but at the beginning of our relationship 6 years ago I said firmly and clearly that I might only think about kids when I will get better mentally and financially. She drinks especially heavy when she is working. Earlier we lived on my money but now we have to work both. Neither me or her now earning money to cover our monthly budget: we have to work both to cover the bills.

We previously lived 100% on my money as I earned a lot of money and everything more or less OK in terms of stress. After a couple of years my flashbacks started and our financial situation because unstable. She started to drink more, especially after she started her money-earning mosaics projects. Currently as I was laid off some months ago and my business died because of the COVID, we are struggling financially and are in debt. But even with our budget is really tight - there are always money for a bottle or two. It drives me mad, Im saying it loud - but she just buys the bottle after bottle together with groceries. I guess wine is around 5-7% of our monthly budget. I also don't like sleeping with someone who has this aroma of wine, it makes me want to vomit - but she is very upset when in the morning the finds out I'm not sleeping in the bed with her - but in another room. She says it makes her unbearably lonely but I’m saying it’s just a consequence of her drinking as I don’t like that wine smell and she gets upset, teary and angry. As you could guess, there is also virtually no sex in our relationship and although she always rejects me when I initiate - to the point I am frustrated to start anything at all - she blames me saying me and my flashbacks are the cause. I have to just jerk off occasionally as I’m healthy in terms of sexuality. 

Once in a while she meets her friend, a girl with serious mental problems – an they drink to the point my wife can't undress herself and she vomits. But I should note that this is a rare occasion, like once in 4-5 months. 

Now I know Im not a saint and that my mental state influences how she feels. Ive a dissociative disorder and emotional flashbacks. Im not abusing her, no beatings or harsh verbal abuse (it happened twice in the beginning but after that I started therapy) - but I can get disconnected, cold and distant for some days and also I can cry and scream because of the flashbacks. Recently her mother also got cancer and that's an additional stress factor... But 1/2 a bottle every day without any ways even to try any other way to cope... Is it alcoholism? What should I do? Am I really the cause of her drinking? I'm at the point I despise her drinking so much that I'm not even sure I'm ready to invest in this relationship further.

We were 21, no kids, no responsibilities, no jobs or anything to worry about. Life was a party. Then I got pregnant. I stopped, and he kept drinking. His excuse was ""I'm doing it now because when the baby is born I won't have any time to drink or have fun anymore!""

Then when she is born, he still drank. He's never drunk, in his mind. We would fight, he would get physical, and in the mornings when he would sober up he would be the sorriest person ever, not drink for a few days, and repeat over and over.

I got pregnant again, I'm holding down jobs, paying for a place to live, paying bills, he still drinks 4-5 nights a week. Its evolved from beer, to 80 proof rum, to 151 proof rum, now to over 350ml of 151 proof rum a night. He used to be naturally slim, now his gut is starting to protrude and is hard. Even my dad laughed at our daughters birthday party the other day saying how he ""needs to lose some weight he's getting a pot belly"".

My SO so complains about his stomach getting big and hard, but won't lay off the liquor. He tried going sober for probation, and couldn't go past a whole 48 hours. The typical mood swings, nausea, headaches, every textbook withdrawal symptom came up at the time it should have.

He turns into a different person when he drinks now. He either cries and talks about wanting to kill himself, or tries to convince me he wants to marry me and loves me and our family so much. I've been completely sober for years, and feel like I'm spectating him killing himself slowly. He gets heartburn, pains, hurts himself when he's drunk, just in terrible condition for a 27 year old

He can't hold down a job because he insists on drinking both before and while at work. He laughs and criticizes his family for being drunks and drug addicts, but doesn't realize he's not just like them, only instead of malt liquor it's high proof liquor mixed with diet soda.

I fantasize about him going to jail and not being let out daily, because it would mean he's being forced to sober up and nothing anyone can do to change it. I just know the moment he'd get out he would ""celebrate"" and drink again because there's something wrong with him mentally or emotionally. He's had childhood trauma, he has a dysfunctional family. He needs therapy, needs to be in a rehab facility to address the root of his alcoholism, not just treat the addiction itself.

He just needs to be a better, more sober man for his kids. We can't keep ignoring his behavior and the willingness he goes to to be able to drink. If we have no money, he steals liquor. If he can't get liquor, he steals malt liquor out of the store. Being sober isn't an option to him, and when I try to confront him about it, I just get ""yepmhm oh yeah yep that's what it is"" just sarcastic blowing off with no real conversation.

The only thing I wanted was to rant I guess, get all this off my chest, maybe let someone who's been in his situation explain what it took to change or if there's even any hope. I tried leaving him before, for 6 months. Got told how he was sober and had a job and was doing right, but once I came back it turned out not to be true.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63294977}"

Addiction, ADHD and obesity both share a lack of dopaminergic tone in the midbrain, specifically the nucleus accumbens and the ventral regimental area of the striatum I believe.

Watch this video by an addiction MD explaining how abstinence is not the full solution, we must replace the dopaminergic activity we lack due to genetics:
