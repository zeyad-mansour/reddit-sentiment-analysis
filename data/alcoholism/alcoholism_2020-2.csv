It's something I've never said out loud before and something I hide from everyone around me.  Something tells me I'm out of control but I've been rationalizing for so long that I don't even trust myself.  

I have been downing at least 1.75 liters of whiskey every four to five days for at least 2 years.   I've always told myself it's a normal amount.  But I know that it's not beneficial to my life.  

Usually I only drink at night but sometimes I'll day drink.  I've tried to stop because I have an extensive history of losing my mind and acting like a complete fool.  I've completely embarrassed myself on numerous occasions.  You'd think that would be enough to stop.  

I've got legal trouble due to my actions from drinking.  I've got people I love concerned about me anytime I order a beer with dinner.  I've got a baby due in a week and I refuse to allow myself to be drunk around him absolutely.  The problem is I keep telling myself I'm going to stop but I seem to never do.  Anxiety and life hit and I feel compelled to numb the enormous amount of pain.

I'm so embarrassed of myself for this.  I want to feel like a good person again.  I know alcohol only brings out the worst in me.  Any advice would be appreciated.",2

Typically once a week or less back then bjt in the last 2 years it’s progressed a lot. Probably 10-15 drinks a week. Last year even more and pretty much since the start of 2020 “it’s now February 28th” I’ve been drinking at least 5 to unlimited drinks a night. Sometimes getting drunk all day or multiple times in a day. I go to school and work and stay sober while working. I go to school drunk on occasion and have 9am classes. I enjoy morning drinking and find it very hard to not stay drunk when I start. But anyway once it hits 5 pm I can’t fight the feeling of craving a drink. I look forward to it all day. I wanna try and go a week or 2 without drinking to see how I feel. Would it be safe to stop drinking completely or should i taper. On average I’ll drink 5-7 crown and ginger ales with about 2 shots in them. If it’s beer I’ll have about 6-7 usually always start my drinking on an empty stomach to feel it sooner. Hardly ever wake up with a hangover and I drink tons of water. Just want some advice on my habits and wether or not I could stop without experiences withdrawals.,2

How do you guys deal with it on every weekend basis?

I live in a small town in some CIS country, there are no AA's in here and I don't feel like attending to one online. I feel quite okay about these urges, I know I have a drinking problem, but I just don't know how to deal with it.

A little advice would be nice.,"I don’t feel like I need alcohol all the time. I’ve been successful in my job and career. I don’t crave booze at work. But when I go home I just think it’s more fun to have a couple drinks and hang out with the wife watch tv or play video games and go to sleep. No issues no anger or arguments. But i always drink on evenings 7 days a week. I can’t name a night I have not gone to bed buzzed if not sighing drunk as I turn off the lap top for bed. I wake up the next morning because I always make sure I get at least 8 hours of sleep rested but throw up a lot after my shower and say hey let’s make tonight not the same. I go for runs and what not feel better every maybe 1 time a week. But I always feel the need to drink after work because I’m bored. I’m not interested in what people say or do around me unless I’m buzzed. Which has basically got me to my high paying job which is sad.  Maybe a functioning alcoholic at this point? If anybody has hit this point and just stopped how? I could probably run half marathons and be super fit beyond what I am if I just went for a run instead of drinking and watching tv after work. It just is easier and more satisfying after a long day.

Edit: this makes it worse but I kill pretty much a fifth on a night.

I just convinced my little brother to voluntarily get locked up in an inpatient detox center. I went with him and helped fill out the paperwork.

He has been to one once before that traumatized him, but he trusts me enough to go even though he's scared shitless and essentially believes he's stepping into a hell that he can't leave.

Words can never express how much I hope I made the right call. 

He was trying to detox at my house, we went through 6 days of ever-increasingly worse symptoms, all while he was holding himself to 20 standard drinks per day so that he doesn't die.

He is a god-damned warrior. Eventually it got to the point where he couldn't keep any liquids down at all, even alcohol, so we supplemented with low doses of benzos to keep him from going into full blown withdrawals until he could keep something down. 

I was with him night and day caring for him, watching him suffer and wishing I could make it easier on him.

I told him on the night of the 6th day that he needed to go to the detox center.

Then, the morning of the 7th day, he was doing so much better I was reconsidering. Back and forth, back and forth I weighed the cost of potential trauma with the possibility that he could die in my care because I'm not a medical professional. Maybe this was finally the turning point? Would I be wasting thousands of dollars of his money and abandoning everything right when the whole goddamn thing was almost over?

I don't know.

I never will know.

I feel like I abandoned him when he needed me the most, *again*, just like everyone else. Seriously, he has had an absolute nightmare of a life, a lot of which I never realized until he started telling me about some of it. Some of it he says is too horrible to tell.

He has never hurt a person except in self defense, and the world and every medical professional or therapist he's ever told the truth to has let him down...even me. What a fucked up situation.

I still made the best call I could. I just hope it was the right one.",67

I still have  cravings, but only when things get hard in life. Nothing like before. I enjoy a good beer, and I would love to find a way to drink in moderation in social settings, vacation, etc, but I'm afraid to bring this method up to my wife after all that shes been through.

He’s an alcoholic and hid it from me until it was too late. He masked his history of unemployment with excuses—always playing the victim. He masked his history of failed relationships with incredible women with excuses—always playing the victim. 

I’m an idiot for believing him. 

I sit here with the ring he put on my finger... knowing our save the dates are out...so angry. Because, as a consultant I can’t babysit his sobriety because I travel for work. Because, my absence leads to his no-shows at work and ability to lie to me. Because, his no-shows at work lead to his lay-offs and his alcoholism leads him to believe its everyone’s fault but his. 

I’m mad because he IS a good guy...except for when he drinks and he doesn’t drink when I’m present. I’m mad because he told me that he had his shit together and wasn’t a ‘fixer upper’ because I’ve had my share of those and only wanted an equal.  I’m mad because he’s a fucking liar. 

I’m mad because I straight up told him the wedding was off if he drank again. My first fucking trip? He’s MIA—not answering texts or calls. His iPhone location is home. That means he went and bought booze while I was on my first flight. And now he’s fucking drunk.

I'm not asking this because I WANT to carry on drinking, but I've spent several years being told total abstinence is the only way if you're an alcoholic. This has lead to me abstaining maybe for a week, sometimes two weeks then inevitably caving in and drinking. With that drink comes intense guilt because I've 'ruined' my sobriety, and what do I do to handle that guilt? Of course I start drinking again. It's been an endless cycle for the past 5 years.

For the first time I decided to seek outside help for my alcoholism! I met with a really lovely (and eccentric) doctor today who explained that for some people, moderation can be better rather than totally quitting. I explained my situation and he said, this time, don't tell yourself you can never drink again. Say 'I will only drink once every two weeks'. If I can manage that, then great, if I can't then we can work on abstinence. 

Just wondering if anyone else who has been an alcoholic for several years had any luck with moderation? 

Side question: Is there a discord for alcoholics that isn't AA based? The one I'm in is very helpful but they also seem very close minded on a lot of things.",2

It will be a year in August. I stopped drinking because it was becoming a habit and I wasn't able to be successful at work without being drunk (worked in customer service, drinking made me more friendly to customers which brought my scores and incentives up since I hated my job sober and was very monotone or impatient) I was praying for a sign on what to do and kept being pointed in the direction to sobriety. I made an agreement that the blessings I receive in life are because of my sobriety and how I'm able to be more involved. I stopped drinking, quit my job and the more I looked back on my time with alcohol, I realized I was one of those people who couldn't just have one drink I had to drink the bottle and never refused a drink if it was offered. I was also the person who used alcohol as an emotional crutch.

For some reason now though, months sober, I've been wanting to drink wine again. I imagine sitting after a long day and drinking a glass to unwind. I love the smell of it and keep fantasizing about the taste. Has anyone who stopped drinking and started again been able to control their intake? I really am struggling with the decision and I keep battling myself saying I'll be able to limit myself to a glass or two but I can just see that progressing. 

A big part is I miss that connection and socialization with my husband of sitting after a long week and dimming the lights with a bottle of wine on the couch. Sure we still talk and unwind together but I miss the coziness of the wine to keep us warm.

That being said, is there a certain point in time - in terms of hours - when you *generally* know your withdrawal will not be severe (or you may not have any withdrawal at all)? I have read varying timelines, but most suggest you’ll be feeling it within 6-12 hours.  How accurate is this?

Looking for some guidance and advice. Hoping the community can help and am here humbly looking for any input. I'm in my mid-40s, drink a pint of vodka a night and legitimately seeking a way to stop altogether. I've been doing this for about 4 or 5 years now. Here's the thing: I have a GREAT life, wonderful job, amazing husband--really nothing to complain about. But this is in my way. I've tried AA (not into the God/higher power thing--no offense), and Smart Recovery, but nothing's really taking. I'm a HIGHLY functioning alcoholic--you cannot tell when I'm drunk and I literally get up each morning and do \~3000m in the pool each day. I've been blotto drunk but people just don't realize. Very dangerous. I'm specifically talking about tapering down, as I've tried cold turkey in the past and had mini seizures. Any advice there? I'm serious about stopping and am open to any advice whatsoever. Thank you in advance for any input! I wholeheartedly appreciate that reddit exist for just such a thing.",2

Every payday the first thing he does is go to the liquor store, buy a 12 pack and drink it, then a few hours later cab back to the liquor store for more. This can repeat upto 3 times a night until hes broke. My family that is familiar with his drinking (myself, my sister, and my mother) have stopped doing anything that will help him get alcohol in any way shape or form. For example we no longer lend him cash as we know where that will go, we don't give him lifts to the liquor store, etc. Now this is where the support group comes in, I'm not sure exactly what is said there although he has pridefully told me on more than one occasion that the group seems to boil down to patting each other on the back and making each other feel better about relapsing with regularity.

Last night my brother got paid so you guessed it, binge drinking going on as I type! Well today my sister called me and we got talking and my concerns about the 'support' group came forth, she went on to inform me how when drunk he has texted her to put her down because his group says his life would be perfect if it wasn't for her. He has said similar things to my mother, and on one occasion where I dared to stand up for my mom he said as much to me. What I'm gathering from him is that this group is enabling him where we have stopped, he gets to be the victim and we (his family) are the victimizers. I'm at wits end and can not take it much longer as I live with him, I have my own problems (severe depression) that require counseling for me to work through and he keeps adding to them to the point where half my sessions are working through what he keeps dumping on me.

My question is that is this a normal situation for support groups? Do they normally make things worse before improving the situation? I mean I'm glad he's taking steps to deal with his problem but between the books they convince him to buy, the group itself, and the counselor he sees maybe once a month nothing is changing.",3

I’m 23 F and wondering if I am an alcoholic, or headed there. I have been recently diagnosed by my therapist as having Substance Abuse Disorder. However, I have some doubts about this because a) I think that people are often over-diagnosed in the mental health community these days and b) I realize you might have substance abuse without actually being an alcoholic (a term they don’t even use anymore but which I think is still very relevant because it involves dependence etc.)

I have had an on-and-off unhealthy relationship with alcohol since I had my first drink at 15. It was intermittent binge drinking from then all through college. I wouldn’t drink all the time and would even go months or years without it, but I always ended up getting in some kind of trouble when I drank. 

In the last year or so I’ve started drinking a lot more, since I lived in Europe last year and had a boyfriend with whom I drank constantly (nearly every day for a bit). Recently I have started drinking alone more. I blackout frequently and have really terrible hangovers. Most recently(2 weeks ago), I had one where I was throwing up blood and bile. Then last weekend I was pet sitting at my friends house and drank a bottle of wine by myself and ended up destroying both her rugs and her couch (a ridiculous story for another time) which I feel deeply ashamed about. 

I don’t know if I would say that I have cravings per se but I do want it and view it as sort of a coveted thing, and anytime I have the opportunity to drink I rarely pass it up. For instance if I’m at a restaurant with friends and people are ordering drinks I find it very difficult to abstain. 

My therapist suggested I go to an AA meeting, and I have been to a couple. When I was there I felt like I could benefit a lot from the space and what was being said, but I still felt uncomfortable calling myself an alcoholic, like an imposter. 

One of the things that makes me doubt it is that I can go such long stretches without a drink, and it’s not like I literally can’t stop myself after one drink. Once I get buzzed or drunk, I find it very difficult to stop, but not after one drink. 

And when I got super hungover the other week someone suggested that I have a beer to settle my anxiety but I had no desire for one. I feel like an alcoholic would have another drink in the morning right away to ease the hangover but I didn’t even want it at all, even though I was feeling really awful mentally.

My parents are both alcoholics as well as my grandparents and I know that it tends to run in families. 

I have realized that all the worst days of my life, the worst things that have happened to me or that I’ve done have been when I was drinking or hungover. There are clearly many reasons for me to stop drinking, but for some reason that’s not satisfying enough to me and I just want to know whether I actually have alcoholism or not. hi 

I know that nobody can tell me or anyone else for sure that they are an alcoholic, but if you have any advice/insight/experience to share that would be so wonderful. It’s just so frustrating to feel this way and I can’t decide if I should give up alcohol all together or not. 

Thanks for reading ❤️",6

How the hell am I the monster here? I'm the one ruining innocent lives? I'm just trying to get back? Why am I the monster?

It started with a couple beers to chill myself because everyone decided to hate me real quick. I couldn't take it. I was being blamed for reporting it. Eventually my ""friend"" got off on a technicality because they were both minors at the time. I got worse and worse. I started drinking lots of booze just to go to sleep at night. I would buy booze from various people. It was never the same person often so nobody knew I had a problem. I took it to my room so my parents wouldn't know. I was drinking just to sleep at night.

Eventually my parents made me go to college. When I got here I tried to be sober. 12 days. I was sober for 12 days. It's so easy getting booze on a college campus. They just gave it to me. I don't know how I passed any classes. I would show up with a massive headache chewing pills to keep it down. 

I spent 21 months drinking every day. I probably killed my liver. Threw up too many times to count. And I want to do it again. Everything hit the fan and I want to go right back into the hole. I want that feeling back. I don't want to care about anything. I just want to let everything go again. Just sit on the ground in the corner of the room with my head against the wall and just drink.

Yes, I probably should see someone. Will I? Nope. Sorry about the rant. I just had to tell someone.

A couple weeks before Christmas I met up with a guy u had been talking to online for a little while. During that night, he raped me while I was asleep.

Ever since that night, I’ve taken to alcohol to numb the pain. I can probably count on one hand the number of days I’ve avoided alcohol since then. 


For the past month some of my friends has expressed their concerns about my drinking. But I’ve always brushed it aside, saying I got it under control and that it’s not a big deal and all that. Because, you know, that’s what I’m convincing myself of. 

But here I am, visiting my mom during winter break from school (I’m a part time high school student), and for the second night in a row I’m quite wasted. And I’m slowly realising that maybe my friends are right, maybe I do have a problem. But I just don’t see the point of stopping, you know? Because as long as I drink, I can ignore all the pain. As long as I drink, I can feel some kind of happiness, it may be a fake kind of happiness, but at least it’s some form of it. 

And for the first time in my life, I’m actually scared of what I may end up doing to myself. I can’t stop all these destructive patterns. And alcohol is my only escape.

When I'm sober, I'm incredibly irritable, angry, and want nothing more than to be alone and depressed. The longest I've been sober was two months (last September-October) and every day was torture. 

My husband is easily able to go sober, but I have a hard time. We're trying to get pregnant so I need to stop drinking. Whenever I stop drinking, I'm not the happy, bubbly girl my husband expects. I isolate myself, and he starts saying thing like ""I should've married an extrovert"" and ""other women don't act like this."" His words spiral me into drinking again, sometimes in secret. There are times where I've snapped at him (and I apologize) but he'll tell me things like ""If you snap at me again I'm leaving. Just go drink so you chill out."" 

This has been the hardest part of quitting for me. I'm on anti-anxiety meds to help with this while I try to go sober, but they only work some days. I've told my husband that when I go sober I'll need alone time and I'm not going to be happy 24/7. He disappointingly says he knows that, but then will talk and talk and expect me to listen to everything when I just want to explode. Then I get the ""Are you even listening? Guess you don't want me around right now..."" which again makes me feel 100% worse. 

Any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated :( I can't stop the shakes, crying, anxiety and irritability when I'm sober. It's too much. My doctor wants to put me on Zoloft next but I'm not sure, and I'm going to a lovely therapist (which has also been hard, as my husband doesn't want me on SSRIs or seeing a therapist).",20

2020-02-24 12:29:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/f8uol0/cant_get_over_drinking/,Can't get over drinking," They say ""old habits die hard"" and I guess that's true!

Hi there! I am 27 y.o. male struggling to give up smoking and drinking and generally destructing myself. I need someone to tell me that this is doable because I am tired of trying and failing.

I can't make a shortcut of my situation so you'll have to stick with me here. I've been smoking and drinking for almost 8 years straight no attempts to give up at all. I never gave it any thought, never thought why I am doing this to myself. I guess I was just young and stupid. I had quite a rough childhood...well it was good, not complaining here, but I had a few traumatic incidents and problems with parent support - grown up without father (died when I was 12, seen him a couple of times before he passed away) and my mother never cared about my teen issues. So I grew up learning to deal with my problems on my own, friends were never there to truly understand and not just ""listen"". Fifteen years old me was having quintessential issues - all I thought about at the time was what's my purpose of living and why on Earth I was born in such a shitty place to live (living in a shithole in some CIS country btw).

I guess all that stuff eventually determined my behavior in some way. I started having this tendency of self-destruction. As years passed I kept on smoking and drinking. Been in a deep depression couple of times, but made it through eventually. Traveled around the world for some time and after coming back home I began working as an ESL teacher (had to make a living somehow) then I found that I am doing pretty well at teaching and it became my profession. My job was incompatible with smoking so I quit. I still don't really understand how I gave it up so easily. I quitted cold turkey, but the other self-destructive habits remained. For some time I was really happy with myself - life took a new turn and it seemed to be brighter than it ever was. But all good things must come to an end, right!?

After three years of not smoking I started all over. Came back from 0 to 15 cigarettes a day. It was awful, I hated every single cigarette I smoked, but this time I couldn't quit. So last half a year I was trying to give up smoking because it affects my mind. I can't think clearly when I smoke, my decision making became worse and critical thinking in general has blunted. I've been failing to quit over and over again. Every time I returned to smoking I analyzed what I did wrong to start it again and couldn't see the reason behind it. Then I've made some research into why I am doing what I am doing and found out that this self-destructive behavior comes from my adolescence - I tend to smoke and drink whenever I feel bad or stressed and I perceive it as a support of some kind, which makes sense since nobody ever was there to support me when I needed it.

Now I work on myself. I've put a lot of effort to quit smoking. I go to the gym and work my ass off, also I work on my mindset and always try to keep myself in a good state, but however long I hold on to good things in my life there's always a moment when I break - something happens and I start feeling this urge to smoke or drink. It feels like some part of me just can't stand me being a ""good guy"". So I am wondering is it even possible to overcome this dark part of my nature that always wants me to destroy myself and hate life?! I look at it as a battle and I always lose it. Neither cigarettes nor alcohol give no pleasure or consolation any more, but still can't get rid of that shit.

TL;DR - struggling to overcome bad habits, fail to keep self-improvement consistent.

Sorry if there were any mistakes in my post, English is not my mother tongue.  
Any advice/help/words of consolation will be greatly appreciated.",14

My father [49] is an alcoholic for a few years, I really don't know when it really started, but I would say atleast for 15 years. He is high functioning alcoholic, he is a farmer and drinks almost every day for almost whole day. He doesn't drink until blackout but still drinks heavily to a point of not being able to speak clearly and reasonably. Problem is that my grandfather is also addicted to alcohol and he drinks some but I newer saw him nearly drink. Problem with that is that they make their own booze, they make around 150 liters for a year and alcohol for my dad is very accessible and cheap. When he is sober, he is very sweet and good man.  His behavior isn't bad to me and my sister even when he is really drunk, but I still hate seeing him when he is drunk so my sister and me are trying to avoid to be around him at all cost. This is when I recognized how big is this problem and started thinking about solution. Our mom is the primary target whenever our dad is drunk and he is trying to start a fight everytime when he is drunk. So how time went on, I became the middle man between our dad and mom, because she had enough of his alcoholism and can't handle it calmly. I'm the one that is trying to calm both sides and evade the further conflict. By the time I recognized that I'm sacrificing my further life and trying to stay home most of the time so my dad and mom don't get in the conflict. I talked to my mom and she proposed that we move out. I agreed and said it should be our last option, but I'm really considering it recently. I'm planning to get a good job in a few months so I could hopefully start earning enough money so my sister, mom and me can move out and live on our own free of 24/7 anxiety feeling. I'm in fear what will happen to my father after we leave, because I really feel sorry for him. He won't go to rehab, nor he will quit drinking and I fear alcohol will kill him soon. He is really overwheight(around 330lbs), has leg problems (bad ankles and varicose veins) and heart problems. Idk what is smartest thing to do in this situation.

I'm in the 20s and a student. I chose a wrong profession, not that far away from what i want, but am at the end of it, though still have some exams, for which i am struggling to get motivation to finish. I spent the last 2 and a half weeks doing nothing but work and drink up to 5 beers a day 4 days a week at evenings. I used to smoke weed for more than 2 months straight almost every day (before that it was around 1 year every two-three days a week) without doing anything productive then i quit it for my well-being, been sober for about 2 years since then. I started drinking beer with movies/TV-shows by myself about half a year ago. Used to be 1 beer, then went to two, now can be sometimes 5. I am from a second-world country living by first-world country values (as i am studying abroad, i changed), making my life extremely difficult in terms of relating myself to anyone, even my parents, from my home-country, or any of my friends as most of them do not care about values i do. I do not feel lonely, as i do have the opportunity to work on my own ideas for the university where i study, which fulfills me to an extent and surrounds me with people who share my values. It has though made me very intolerant to differences between people as i am in the middle of two completely different societies, and left me feeling alienated from both, as i no longer feel any connection to anyone.

I have grown up being thought that i am to be grateful to have what i have, and pressured into a profession for it's large salary by my parents. They are not educated, and have no perspective in terms of what science is. It takes two days of me being home to get in some kind of argument. They believe my environmentalism is a sect, they have no respect for my personality or my values, and even though they are the upper class in my country they only care about money and having more and they would be considered middle-class in the US. To put it in a perspective an average person earns 150 dollars a week there and still can have a savings account and a normal life. Homophobic, patriarchal, suppressive of opinions, not caring about anything but living in an eggshell. I came very close to cutting all contact with them because of their lack of respect towards my choice of being vegetarian.

I know people have harder lives than i do, but all of this has just driven me to the point where the only thing keeping me going is my work. I lost my motivation for everything else. I am a plant in front of a screen, drinking beer and waiting for something to change, knowing that it won't. A definition of a predisposition for alcoholism.",3

I’ll never drink them because I avoid this stuff naturally as I enjoy eating healthily (most the time) but I’m gonna have it in and whenever I get the intense craving I’m going to go and snack/drink some sugary nice treats which is giving me a treat and a dopamine hit while not drinking alcohol (meeting half way) and this will suppress my alcohol craving too.

I’m 19, had my first beer when I was 13 - my country’s drinking culture is extremely unhealthy so I suppose I just got labelled as someone who “drinks a bit more”. I don’t think I can come up with a single party where I haven’t blacked out. I started going to parties when I was 14-15. Ive looked at the self assessment thing and ticked off 6 of the symptoms. 
I don’t drink daily so I just...guessed that I must not have a problem? And this is literally only an idea I have for myself, I think if my friend was showing signs but not drinking daily I’d still be encouraging them to get help.

And it’s not like I can’t resist alcohol either, I store some bottles in my room, and have only had a drink alone  maybe.... one time this past year? But if I go out, and I have one drink? I need to drink more. 

I woke up today and didn’t know where I was. Thankfully I was at a friends flat, but for a moment I was terrified that I might’ve messed up terribly. 
I still felt drunk when I woke up, I have a huge cut on my lip and I don’t know how I got it but I’m guessing I bit myself or some shit..

I take Ritalin for my ADHD..Found out that if I take my meds close to going out I get a more intense effect. I’m a fucking idiot.

And part of me knows that I have a problem I guess but another part is just screaming that it’s normal. I’ve never talked about any of this before with anyone because it’s so embarrassing, and I’m sure a lot of you can relate?

I can’t get help, I’m trans, they’ll cut me off testosterone and I’ll be depressed again. So I’m just left here alone because my family would laugh at me if I told them any of this. I guess I just need a hug? I don’t know.. I’m sure you guys have way more serious problems and I just.. Everything is dumb rn I feel like I shouldn’t be having these issues at this age.

2020-02-22 20:25:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/f82dfh/kombucha/,Kombucha,"
I'll shorten this story somewhat. When I was in highschool, a family friend suggested I start drinking kombucha. I was in poor mental state (depression, anxiety, mild psychosis) at the time. I tried it and loved it, and was amazed by all the promised health benefits. 

It became habitual, and what started as normal cravings soon turned into a constant inability to be without a bottle. I would put it in water bottles to bring to school and find ways to take it with me, because I didn't think I could go without it. I even avoieded going out sometimes so that I could stay home and drink it, without having to bring more than one bottle with me. After many months of drinking it, it started causing problems. It was giving me mouth ulcers so severe I could not speak or smile for days. I wasn't eating or hydrating properly.  

At one point, I drank many bottles in a day. I didn't even count how many. I started getting dizzy, feeling incredibly relaxed, and everything looks like it was under water. I had the worst psychotic break of my life and long story short drove in a car. I was fine and so is the passenger. But it was scary. It took me some thinking to figure out what was going on. I assumed because the alcohol level in kombucha is so low (it's not even sold as an alcoholic beverage) that there was no way it could be affecting me like this. 

I decided I should stop drinking it. So I tried to stop. For up to a year after stopping, I still had cravings so severe I thought I wouldn't be able to survive without a drink. Stopping was incredibly hard. It took more self-control than I think I've ever had to use in my life. 

I've now been ""clean"" for many months. Now that I'm in college, I have alot more friends that drink. I question whether I want to abstain forever or not, and the debate scares me. A part of me thinks it wouldn't be so bad to have some, other people don't find it dangerous right?

On a good day, I can be around alcohol and be fine. But on an even slightly bad day, I can't be around it at all. I went to a party hosted by my viola professor, where they served alcohol to the upperclassmen (legally) and it was hard to pay attention while the bottle was in the corner of my view. All I could think about was pouring myself some. Certain songs that I used to listen to while drinking kombucha, I cannot hear without instantly nearing a relapse. Even writing this is causing me to hear the song in my head and want a drink. 

I'm in the process of recovering from my mental health problems of the past, and I worry about slipping downhill. I'm open to any advice, reassuring or otherwise. I just need to find a way to deal with this. 

 I don't think that Kombucha is this addictive to everyone, although I've been reading on the internet articles about the difficulties of quitting kombucha, and why alcoholics should restrain. Addiction runs heavily in my family. 

I've read that although Kombucha is addictive, it is not as addictive as coffee or tea. I drink coffee occasionally, and tea often, but I've never developed a problematic dependence or addiction to caffeine. How is this possible? Should I consider this an addiction or a problem? Should I abstain in the future? 

My friend suggested that perhaps I have an ""addictive personality"" and just get addicted easily, but I that is certainly not the case with other addictive substances like caffine. 

I figured I would post here because I didn't know where else to start. I feel lost and alone. 

TRDL; I had an extreme reaction to the low level of alcohol in kombucha, causing a psychotic break, and a heavy dependency.  I'm confused about how this is possible, and what I should do about it now.",2

Pretty much since i hit my bottom back in August when I woke up in the back of the police car, having blacked out at the wheel and hit three parked cars. Since then, I've been a bit of a hermit while trying take control back of my life. 

I went out to a fancy dinner with my bestie, then hit the local arcade/bar. And I had a blast, I wasn't even tempted to drink. As a show of solidarity, my best friend even went without drinking (she'd always been a bit of an enabler with me, until she realized just how bad my drinking had become), we sipped mocktails at dinner, and played arcade games for a couple hours.

I've been scared to go out for months. Most of my friends are drinkers, and most of our hangout spots are bars. But it was so easy to not even think about drinking, and I'm feeling the best I have for a long time.",58
2020-02-22 16:00:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/f7yr3a/20_year_old_male_the_story_of_my_addiction_and/,20 Year Old Male - The Story of My Addiction and Its Consequences,"Hello Reddit. I've never made a post on here but I figure it will be useful to type my situation out while also receiving input. So first off, alcoholism is common in my family. My dad, uncle, grandfather, and stepmom are all alcoholics. My great uncle died of alcohol withdrawal at 52. Despite all of that, I was turned off by alcohol until I was 17. My father had a very strict routine where he would binge drink every other day. On Sunday in particular, he would start drinking at 1 PM at the start of football and usually not finish until 2 AM. During this time, he was alone most of the time, minus when we would go outside and check on him. I never thought much about it since it was a commonality in my childhood. 

An important caveat is that I have suffered from major depression and anxiety since I was 12. I have been on antidepressants since 12 as well and have attended many counseling sessions. I was also diagnosed to be low on the autism spectrum. Nothing seemed to make me feel whole. Therefore, I was always looking for some kind of dopamine and stimulation to make myself feel better. I was more of a weed person I think because of how I perceived my family’s addiction. I smoked for the first time when I was in 10th grade and I loved the escape. I eventually became addicted to that and have smoked basically every night for the last 3 years. My mother bought me a 6 pack of Corona Extra when I was 15. I ended up only drinking 3 beers. I liked it, but not like weed. 

Fast forward to when I was 17. My stepmom’s sister had a wedding and my dad told me “son, it’s time for you to drink with your father”. I got hammered for the first time. I LOVED it. In fact, I loved everyone. I was going up to everyone and hugging them and telling them how amazing they were. I was incredibly happy and my social anxiety was nonexistent. But all good things come to an end, and I projectile vomited the next morning. That really discouraged me from drinking again. However, at family functions, everyone would encourage me to drink because of how funny I became. I would succumb to peer pressure and get hammered every time. The same pattern of sickness and regret would occur every morning after. But, eventually, this pattern stopped and I stopped getting sick.

I assumed this happened for one of two reasons or both. First, I learned to pace myself better. I realized alcohol took longer to feel the effects than marijuana and adjusted accordingly. Secondly, the frequency of my drinking increased as I started to crave it and I would drink not just at family events but also with my dad sometimes. Eventually, I began to drink alone which really filled the void for me. I liked it so much I got tired of relying on people to get it for me and I ordered a Fake ID. I look older than my age so that was always a plus. Fun fact: I ordered drinks at a bar in Manhattan at 17 and didn’t get carded. 

Despite my marijuana addiction and growing alcoholism, I was a great student and graduated in the top 10 of my high school class. So I ended up going to college (I have a 4.0 and am in the most prestigious honor society in the country). Due to my social anxiety, I chose to live by myself. I became lonely, fast. I didn’t know anyone going to my school. So I would fill the void by drinking alone most nights. During this time, I was really seeking a companion so I turned to Tinder and Bumble. I would drink before my dates to alleviate my social anxiety. This was the first time I dated while drunk. I loved it because I felt confident and able to keep the conversation going. None of my dates knew I was drunk, although sometimes they would suspect. I drove under the influence regularly on dates. I’ve probably driven drunk at least a 100 times. It was a miracle I never hurt anyone or was caught. Due to my age, .01 BAC would count as a DUI. 

Looking back on it, it is shocking and disgusting that I did that. My mom did justify it though by claiming she did the same thing when she was young. Anyways, eventually, I met the love of my life. I never connected so well with a person so quickly and I took her virginity. I came clean about driving drunk (I took her to the fair and hit a campaign sign) and she convinced me to stop driving drunk. I haven’t driven under the influence of anything since then. During this time, I was drinking 6 nights a week. I figured I couldn’t be an alcoholic if I took 1 night off. She took issue with my drinking frequency, but I blew it off. 

Later on, she moved in with me and witnessed my drinking habits more and more. By this point, I wasn’t all lovie-dovie as I was the first time I got wasted, but I wasn’t necessarily an asshole either. I would sometimes say things I regretted. It did get to the point where I wouldn’t remember the conversations and experiences we had while she did. But it started to get worse when I reconnected with my best friend from elementary and middle school (we stopped talking at the start of 8th grade). It was great because I was looking for a friend and it was easier to be friends with someone already knew me to my core. 

Of course, my girlfriend did not like all the attention I was giving him especially after he got arrested and kicked out by his roommates. This also spiraled my friend into a deep depression and he became an alcoholic also. When we got together, all we would do is drink, complain, and say how much we hate the world and certain people. It was toxic. It affected me, something I didn’t realize until my girlfriend left me. 

As I became an increasingly negative person, my vibe rubbed off on her. She was always a very positive person (why I love her so much) and thus this was a terrible change for her. Not only this but with my negative attitude came more drinking and bingeing. I began to become belligerent and insulting to those around me, including my friend and girlfriend. On Feb 7th, my girlfriend left the apartment after we got in a fight (and I cockily told her “BYEEEEEE”). Random fun fact: I got so drunk at Disney Springs security asked my family to get me off the premises or they would call the cops.

She broke up with me the next day. I was crushed. I became incredibly depressed and started day drinking. My friend was supportive initially. We would get drunk together every day for a week straight. I was miserable and desperately wanted my girlfriend back. This Wednesday, she came over and we attempted to be “friends”. There was too much sexual tension so I suggested FWB. But then that didn’t work and I confessed I wanted us to work on getting back together. 

It finally clicked for me that day that alcohol and my friend were causing the problems in our relationship. So I pleaded that if I got rid of those things we COULD have a healthy relationship. She agreed to give me a second chance. I have not had a drink since Tuesday night and last night when she came over she drank and I did not. It is also important to note that I have $150 worth of alcohol in my apartment. I told my friend I needed a break so my girlfriend and I could work out things. Understandably, he felt betrayed and upset. Now my girlfriend is still skeptical about getting back together but she is waiting to see long-term results. 

I’m sorry that was so long, and thank you if you took the time to read the entire thing. However you react to this post, all feedback is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Alcoholism runs in my family, I have depression/anxiety/autism, alcohol destroyed my relationship and friendship, and I have now been sober (from alcohol) since Feb 18th.",6

I 36(f) have been invited with my 36(m) partner for almost 7 years now. He's always been a drinker, but for the last 3 years-ish it's gotten really really bad. I'm talking 750 of vodka  in 12 hours (when he has it, sometimes it's copious amounts of wine) bad.

7 days a week I watch him just get completely hammered. I don't even know when he blacks out anymore. I feel equal parts so afraid for him, angry, and hurt. All of these feelings are really starting to take their toll on me. I find myself getting angry and really short with him and I don't want to be that way. I'm generally a very laid back person. 

He's an incredibly smart, generous, and considerate person and I really want to be here to support him, but I'm really feeling lost.

It was a double edged sword, but something good came out of it.


I realized that i literally can NOT drink absolutely whatsoever anymore because i WILL hurt myself. I have a child to worry about and i can't leave her behind just because my supposed soul mate decided to abandon me which caused me to do the  unthinkable. Its not worth it, and im crying as i say this but IT'S NOT WORTH IT.



The ex is an alcoholic too so if she feels this same exact way, if our relationship only made her want to drink and purposely harm herself, i fucking understand now.  I understand all of it, my sweetest K. 


I already asked my mom to send me to rehab if i relapse again, as much as i want to and feel like dying without you? I can't.  Because i cant leave my beautiful child behind. And if i die now, it would be another way of me giving up on the future i still so sorely desire with you, the love of my life.


I read another post recently that said the single thing that relationships need to reconcile is TIME, and as of now? I have all the time in the world. I refuse to give up and die by this illness that i helped you fight off yourself last year. I will not give up, and god so help me, i will never drink again.


Social drinker since 13? Functioning alcoholic since 17? I stand here 30 years old. Full blown alcoholic, worried about withdrawal. I am without a job, soulmateless, 50 pounds less than my weight at this time last year, heart on the brink of failure, damaged liver, crippling anxiety, all of my loved ones frightened of me and i am defeated but NO MORE.  I need to be entirely sober.


I will be entirely sober.
 I was sober when you decided to start treatment up until we started having serious problems.  I CAN NOT drink any more. I am looking forward to the new me in this new life that i am taking back right now. I will no doubt reach out to you in the somewhat near future and if you still dont want me? I don't mind living the rest of my life alone with my child. I told you that you were it for me and i never wanted anyone else and i MEANT IT.



Goodbye vodka, the only one who has ever been always there for me.


Goodbye for now, my sweetest Kat.

I miss you, and i will always want you. 
(My fiance, not the liquor)


-B.A.O




I will be posting updates of my status and hardships of my newfound sobriety in the future. Thank you to everyone in the alcoholism subreddits.

He did it all, inpatient and outpatient treatment for addiction, medication, AA, sober living house and then...I don’t know how, he got sober. It happened around the time my older brother and him reconnected about 10 years ago. It was like I had to learn how to cope with sober dad like I had learned to cope with drunk dad when I was younger. He died at home, somewhat unexpectedly, and so I didn’t get the chance to tell him enough that I was proud of him for getting sober. When I spoke with the coroner and he was talking about how there was no indication that drugs or alcohol caused his death, I literally broke down crying. My dad, suffered from the lifelong disease of alcoholism and died a sober man. I can’t even articulate what that means to me as his daughter. To anyone reading this that struggles with alcoholism, addiction or mental illness, I’m rooting for you...every minute, every hour, every day you are sober, and I am so proud of you.",177

My sister and brother has tried to help him but he just gets worse and worse.  He once cut his eye after a fall in 2014, he basically drank like 2 wine bottles and took a Clonazepam from his mate.

My mom who i live with now divorced him in 2006, after he psychically abused her and many times attempted to use a weapon, i witnessed all of this as a child, i was 7 years old, i basically saw my dad try to hurt my mum, i remember sitting in the toilet calling the police almost every week, i had night terrors and wasn't able to function at school. In 2006 his alcoholism was bad, in 2015 it was pretty bad but he was still capable of a job, but in 2020 it IS CODE RED bad, severely chaotic.

He constantly fakes illnesses for attention and has been a burden to the ER, he keeps lying to us about his health and that he suffered multiple strokes and heart attacks, none of these were confirmed. His marriage with his wife (my step mom) is falling apart, he is almost homeless, he looks homeless, and is getting worse. He does not want help, he never took his meds as prescribed. It is now that i realize my dad likely has Borderline Personality Disorder and munchausen syndrome, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. His IQ is also fairly low (around 80-85) so it is hard for him to understand many things and have an ability to have an open mind, but i am not judging as i have a intellectual disability myself (diagnosed)

We used to talk every week, now i don't speak to him for months and have no interest. He is slowly dying, and many predict he won't live for another 5 years. It's really painful that i never had the father i deserved it, but deep down i feel sad, i love my dad deep down, he is a man who needs help. and unfortunately i have also seen many similarities in his behavior with mine, i am also being tested for Borderline personality disorder and other things like NPD, ASPD",10
2020-02-21 23:50:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/f7nsni/alcoholic_problem_drinker_no_problem/,"Alcoholic, problem drinker, no problem?","Basically I quit drinking for 10 months in 2017-2018 after burning through my inheritance from my late mum on rent, not working, making music and drinking basically every second day - not proud of myself AT ALL. I was living in Toronto and would regularly drink 5-6 double G&T's, a couple shots, maybe a couple glasses of wine to retain the in-between drunk & tipsy level and a few beers for when I got home at like 2-4 am. Smoking cigarettes all night, maybe some weed, maybe some other substance someone else offered me. Would regularly be invited to bar lock-ins.

Anyway, I ran out of money and started selling music stuff, kept getting f'd up but slowly started drinking less and less & managed to ween myself off it after a few weeks. I remember cooking bacon in my condo with my hands shaking a couple days afterwards & feeling like i'd dodged a bullet. I proceeded to sort my shit out over a 6 month period, with a couple relapses, but became a line cook/chef & left Toronto after going from a part-time to full-time position in an Italian restaurant, beginning to open and close the kitchen, being given more trust by the head chefs. It was pretty cool.

Anyway so, I move back home, live with my Dad for a week or so, he doesn't want much to do with me as 6 months prior, I'd blown all my inheritance (it was less than £50,000.) He hasn't seen any of the attempted progress i'd been trying to make/doesn't even think I have a problem. I move out and get a live-in job at a hotel over here as a chef, end up changing roles in the hotel to 'night porter.' The head chef & I didn't get along & I was also a bit out of my depth with the level of cooking, but the hotel still thought I was alright.

Lived there for like 7-8 months, got a new job on night shifts at a supermarket for more money & better hours. **But THEN, I** bumped in to an old close friend just before I started working at the supermarket, he invited me to go out that weekend and THIS was where I caved. After months of declining invites, going out and drinking water, walking through town trying to avoid seeing people I knew so I couldn't be swayed. I just thought f' it, i've got my life a bit sorted now, I can do this!

Fast forward to today, It's now been a year and a few months of slowly sliding in to my old ways. I've been getting drunk 2-3 times a week, spending most of my salary on booze and partying. On my last session I went through 4 pints, a couple shots and a bottle of wine, with some coronas when I got home (in my mind I don't think that's much.) But it's the fact I drank all that, by myself, alone in public and alone at home. I'm only 25 years old.

My friends & family tell me I don't have a problem, but they never see me at 8am with black eyes, pale skin, chapped lips, smelling of stale smoke, mildly suicidal (would probably never do it, but I start romanticising it in my head - to show 'them!') They see me showered, well dressed & sociable after a couple pints, before they go home & then I go do my own thing. \^\^\^\^\^ They even kind of try get me to drink and stuff, don't think they're dicks because they don't seem to understand the seriousness of the situation, like I can hold it together alright, but just i've had enough. I don't know what to do, because theres a heavy drinking culture where I live and most my friends drink and party in excess.

Sorry for the long winded story but I just felt I needed to get this off my chest, somewhere. If you read this far, thank you. I'm literally just about to go to sleep, 6 days sober - feels good man. ",3

But the following day everything is a blur.

I do not want to do this. I feel like I am not in control. When I wake in the morning I can feel my liver is inflamed. Everything is telling me to stop. But I don't. Sometimes the first thing I want to do is take a drink just to get this day behind me. It's like I am living on a treadmill of pain. The only progress made is the humiliations earned. I have been lately thinking that I could put a stop to it. But I don't want to hurt my family. It feels like my footprint has become a black ink that bleeds into the past and future, deleting everything but shame and the way forward cannot be seen as there is no compass, no guiding star, and no assurance other than the knowledge that I'll once more drink myself into oblivion and live again in this shadow.

Why wait til rock bottom to assess if alcohol is having a negative effect on your life?,"Sometimes I look at my relationship with alcohol and decide to reduce how much I drink. My liquor bottles are running out faster than I'm comfortable with or whatever.

When I say to someone I want to drink less they will always make excuses for me. They'll say you don't have that much of a problem, you don't drink every day, you're not putting yourself in danger. Like??? Why do I have to wait for that to happen to want to be better to myself? I feel like it's because they might drink more than I do and they're confronted.

It's like everyone wants you to be alcoholic. They encourage it and act like it's funny and endearing until you are in a really dire situation and then it's you who has a problem.

I say this because I was looking for resources for my boyfriend. I think his drinking is becoming a problem and affecting his life. But a lot of questionaires are really intense. People who might be starting down a dangerous path might not relate to all of the questions and could have a false sense of security about their lifestyle.

My life overall hasn't gone great. I'm lucky in some ways but not others. Bojack Horseman is a close enough parallel to my life of all things that if my life was made into a TV show critics would call it a copy.

I just want to get my strange experience with alcohol out there and see if any one else shares this mindset.

Last year on a whim I started drinking spirits. There's a spirit I like that when mixed with a fruit mix is barely tolerable as otherwise I completely hate the taste. When I have this drink(s) it's equivalent to 6 units of alcohol. I started having this in November 2019 once every 3 nights. In December it became once ever 2 nights. Towards Xmas and new years it was every night. I was getting real depressed because I worried about being addicted. I didn't even like the effect. I don't know why I did it. I'd imagine my evening ahead of me and I'd always put that drink in my plans. The thought of having it was better than having it.

So mid-January rolls round and all the celebrations are over. I just stopped putting drink into my evening plans. I find I'm okay that night. Huh? Night two comes around and I'm still fine. Day 3? Fine again. Day 4? Well I'm still fine so I guess I wasn't addicted after all. In that case let's have the drink again!

That's been my pattern ever since mid Jan. There's no urge to drink. No urge to buy any. I've had none now for days. I wrote this post because I thought I might get some more tonight? But then I realize that hey there's no point because it just makes me sway a bit and feel tired. If I wanted to feel tired I could just have a Phenergan! If I wanted to sway and feel woozy I could just have a Phenergan and \*fight it\*.

I genuinely don't understand any of this. After months of alcohol ... even just a bit ... I'm supposed to be hooked? At least mildly but theres no physical or mental symptoms.

But then I wonder is that thought where I go ""lets include alcohol in my evening plans"" the addiction for me? Because it sometimes appears. It always feels good to think that, but the reality is that it does little for me. In-case you're wondering evening plans are things like watching a TV show or film with friends or family, going for evening constitutionals around the city or beach, going to an art class. I'm never alone when I drink. I did a few times earlier having my drink with lunch on lazy lazy days.

Take care everyone.",1

My family is going through a very rough situation right now. I have a cousin, let's call him Rick, who is al alcoholic. He had managed to get sober for the last two years, but after his last relationship ended about two months ago, he started heavily drinking again. The situation is worse that it has ever been before, to the point where he isn't going to work or paying any of his bills, or his rent. My aunt, his mother, lives in the same building as him, and she along with my other cousin, Sergio (Rick's brother), have been the ones that have been helping Rick the most. It has gotten to the point where Rick has gone to my aunt's apartment and started taking money from her, and even shoved her at one point so he could get her purse. 

We want to know what we can do to get Rick help. An order of protection has been discussed by us, but my aunt is unwilling to go through that process because she wants to be able to help her son. Are there any city/state resources or legal resources we can use in this situation?

Thanks for any help and advice.

I guess maybe there’s no explanation for the way an alcoholic acts, but I thought I would ask and see if I could get some closure.  For the last five or so years of our marriage, when he would get drunk, he would get angrier and angrier at me. He would scream at me and curse at me and make fun of me and threaten to hurt me. Towards the end, he would threaten to kill me when he got drunk and we got separated when he actually pushed me down one time.  There was no particular reason, I never did anything to make him angry. When he was sober, he never acted like that, and he would say how much he loved me.  Now that we are separated, he talks about how much he loves me and wants to get back together, but I will never do that, because I honestly think he is one drinking binge away from actually killing me. But I just don’t understand how someone can act so differently when he’s drunk and when he’s sober. What does he actually think, does he love me or does he hate me?

How can I best support her?,"Alternate account due to identifying information on my main account. 

My girlfriend has been trying to stay sober for over a year now, mostly successfully, but not completely. 

In September of 2018 she went to rehab/sober living in another state, was there for 3 months, came back and almost immediately relapsed. 

After ending up in the hospital/detox at the end of December 18, she really buckled down and started trying. She went to AA, Celebrate Reclvery, started going to a church, found support, and was continuing outpatient therapy. She had a job, and things were looking up. 

Until April when she relapsed again. And then again in July. Twice in November. And most recently, this week.

When she drinks, she's completely non functional, drinks until she's half asleep, doesnt know where she is, what time or day it is, and has no capability to stop whatsoever. She'll talk on the phone to her son and tell him that she's fighting because she wants to stay sober for him, and chug from a bottle the second she hangs up. 

This week, she started on Monday, but within a few hours (already too intoxicated to even stand straight) she told me that she wanted me to come pick her up and come take her to detox, because she didnt want to let it get as bad as it did last time. So I want to get her. 

I know better and I know I shouldnt have, but she ended up getting combative, decided she didnt want to go to detox, didnt want to stop. When she drinks, due to how out of it she gets, she has a tendency to get herself into extremely unsafe situations, be it by going to stay with people she doesnt really know and dont have her best interests in mind, people that won't work to get her to stop, etc. So I brought her and her stash to my house to make sure that if she's going to be doing it, at least I know she's not going to wind up dead or killing someone else driving around. 

At every possible opportunity I tried to talk her into going back to detox, and finally convinced her last night. A three day bender is actually not bad, considering previous relapses, which I know sounds sad, but yeah. 

Anyway, I had a chat with the counselor that she works with every time she ends up in detox, and he expressed his desire to continue to help her, both with her mental health struggles and with her addiction, but said that it may be time for more... drastic measures. He said that, working with her parents, he can get her into an extremely intensive court ordered inpatient treatment program for mental health and substance abuse. He said it's a 6 month program, and he sees a lot of success with people that go into it, especially those that want to fight, and want to try, but once the darkness creeps in, it doesnt leave. 

I relayed this to her parents, and they talked to him, and it seems like at the moment, they are leaning toward going through with it. 

I know she's going to be extremely angry, hostile, and not particularly care for the idea, and is going to be extremely resentful about this step, however, she'll eventually realise that it's for her own good. 

Does anyone have an experience similar to mine, or suggestions on the best way to support her, her son, and her parents during this time?

Thanks!",2
2020-02-20 17:18:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/f70vhu/am_i_an_alcoholic/,Am I an alcoholic?,"So today at around 9pm when I had 2 crates of beer delivered to my house after already drinking 5 magnums my son called me an alcoholic. He’s 11. I drink a lot. 
I work in a professional job. I don’t drink days before I work generally but can have a lot of days off sometimes and will drink maybe 1-3 days a week depending on my shifts. He said I couldn’t go a week without drinking. That might be true. I can’t remember a time in the past 10 years that I’ve gone a week without drinking. It’s worse when I’m on holiday and it wouldn’t be abnormal to drink every day when I’m off. Not always to excess but an average would be around 15 units a night. I’d be functional the next day after that. I could drink a lot more sometimes. It is also usual to have days off. Sometimes up to 6 consecutive days off drinking. 
I have historically got up and started drinking early in the morning but usually only on party weekends etc when I’m going a bit mad and everyone else is. I also come from a culture where excessive drinking is pretty much the norm. Everyone does it, everyone talks about it, no one ever says, your drinking is out of control etc. It’s basically a running joke that we’d all drink vodka through the eye. We’d have a gin in work at 9am if it were acceptable. 
I often crave a drink, particularly after difficult shifts or hard days. I feel relaxed when I drink but the day after I’m usually tired, irritable and ineffective. 
I’ve put on a lot of weight in the past few years, my house is a riot, I feel like my brain doesn’t work like it should and I’m permanently tired. 
As a teenager I had pretty serious mental health problems and alcohol was always a coping mechanism. It probably has been since I was around 13. I’m early 30s now. 
My only abstinent phase was when pregnant and breastfeeding and in the first few years of my sons life I probably only drank a few times a year.
I have thought for a while that my drinking is starting to affect my life in negative ways. Specifically I am not as efficient as I used to be, I am not as cognitively efficient either. I am tired all the time and have no energy to do anything. The things I do do, I do in a fugue of sleepiness or hungoverness generally. 
My anxiety has also been pretty terrible in the past year. It’s difficult to tell whether my job caused the escalation in my anxiety or my drinking and which caused the exacerbation of the other. 
I did see my GP around October last year and was signed off for stress and anxiety. They offered antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication which I declined as I have tried a number before and feel that they have been ineffective. I have tried a number of antidepressants and also found that when I came off beta blockers I was getting horrendous migraines. At that time in October I had symptoms close to PTSD due to an extremely stressful work environment. I couldn’t leave the house, everything made my heart pound. I suppose I’m a little better now but often things like going to the supermarket are just such a huge and scary task. 
I find it difficult to pick apart everything that’s going on in my life. I think I probably do have a problem with alcohol, that being a psychological one that goes back  20 years. I don’t know how to start addressing that. 
I have considered AA but have actually attended AA meetings before with friends and personally would describe them as a scary cult. I know that they help so many people and do so much excellent work and fill the gaps in the health service but I just don’t know that AA will ever be for me. I don’t believe in a God, I don’t believe in a higher power, I can’t commit to all that mantra stuff. Maybe I should go via health services for help? I just don’t know. Maybe I don’t really have a problem and I’m just being melodramatic?
Any insight much appreciated.",1

Any simple ways I can encourage him or actually help him out without making him feel bad about his alcoholism?,"I really want this to be more of an upbeat thread so I won't start off  by complaining about my dad's alcoholism or tell you how terrible he is for choosing this life, but I'll give you a bit of a backstory:  he's been drinking since before I was born, and got together with my mom when both of them were really young. She had me when she was just 18 and then she had my little brother at 21, but then realised that he's got a serious drinking problem and isn't the right guy so she left us not too soon after my brother was born. My grandparents were the ones that raised us while my dad was out drinking and living his life most of his time, as he was also very young at the time and I guess wasn't ready to be a responsible single dad at the age of 26.   


We've never really had a typical good father-daughter relationship when I was growing up, he was   
 more like a big brother to me and my grandparents were more like our real parents because they were the ones taking care of all three of us. Now, let me say this: On good days he was amazing, like a cool bigger brother that would let me and my brother stay up late, eat snacks, buy us toys or watch action movies that aren't for kids or do anything we wanted. He was also very smart and taught me a lot of stuff about literature, music, art & would tell the funniest jokes!  


On bad days though he was very irritative, always yelling and insulting me for the slightest little things and saying I'm trash just like my mother, getting in terrible arguments with my grandparents in front of us, and generally not being very fun to be around at all. Being so young and under the influence of alcohol most of the time, he was also very prideful and would rather stay at home than work a job that he thought was beneath him, would constantly talk back and get in arguments with his bosses or my grandparents, and would rarely back down on something he said or thought and was overall very difficult to communicate with. He's never been physically abusive though, and has never done anything serious to hurt us or cause us any harm.  


As I grew up and his bad days became the regular, we grew distant and I decided to get myself out of this toxic environment and move out to another town after turning 18, while still keeping in touch with the rest of my family. Me and my dad haven't spoken much in the last 7-ish years, I wouldn't answer the phone when he'd call as he was never there for me when I needed him and I was angry with him for choosing alcohol and living an easy, care-free life over actually being a dad for me and my brother. I got over the fact that I could never count on him -  I had tried talking him out of drinking, yelling at him, crying at him, nothing had ever worked so I accepted the fact that he's just an alcoholic, forgot about him and moved on with my own life.  


Now, I have finally reached a point in my life where I've realised that being resentful or angry at him isn't going to help anyone, so I've gradually started to talk to him again. The first time I saw him after a few years of no contact, I was completely shocked at how much he had aged. I always remembered him as a strong, tall and well built man. Now, he's merely a shadow of his former self - he's starting to have memory problems, most of his teeth have rotten out due to bad hygiene and negligence, he's emaciated due to not eating enough and drinking for such a long period of time, he has issues walking, gets tired easily and he told me he has actually passed out a couple of times, one of those being while he was driving his boss a couple of weeks ago which led to him being let go from his job today. He called me after getting his last paycheck, saying he wants to come over and talk.  


When we talked face to face, I didn't hear my young dad's stong voice but the voice of a scared old man who's finally coming to terms with the fact that he made some terrible life choices and isn't 26 anymore. We talked about a lot of things, he admitted that he was a shitty parent and I told him that the past is the past and I hold no grudges. He finally admitted he has a problem with drinking, he said he's been drinking for most of his life because he's got no motivation and alcohol is a way for him to numb out the pain, boredom and struggles in life. He was also slightly drunk today, I could sense the smell, or maybe it was just lingering on him - after so many years, I don't think he can physically stop drinking. But he reached out for help. He shared his fears & worries and after all these years, finally opened up about many things that he's never talked to me about.  


My question is, how can I help him in this situation? I want to him to regain his motivation, I want to push him in the right direction somehow, get him to try and get his life back in order at least a little bit but I'm not sure how. He probably does not have a lot of years left and is already miserable enough due to his physical condition, I plan on taking him to a doctor and seeing what can be done to get his body in shape, but I have no idea how to lift his spirits up or give him the emotional support he needs right now. I won't try to ask him to stop drinking. He already knows he needs to, but I don't think he can at this point since he's been doing it for so long, and me just telling him 'you need to stop drinking' won't solve the problem or do anything. But maybe I can at least help him be at least a little less miserable somehow?",4

For the past few years, on an infrequent basis, i've been having insane night terrors, that seems to be the only thing it could be. People around me hear me banging on things, screaming, etc, while asleep. I'm completely unaware of it and not in control of it at all. 

I drink a LOT. Probably close to a liter of liquor per evening on a long night. 

I had severe sleeping issues prior to starting to drink, which is why I started in the first place, but I never did anything crazy in my sleep, which kind of leaves the booze as the primary suspect here. 

Anyone else ever experience anything like this? 

Also, I just got my first order of Naltrexone from a sketchy Indian pharmacy, which i'm excited about, but also a bit nervous. If I don't drink, or drink significantly less than normal, I have crazy muscle spasms, insane dreams, fairly typical withdrawl/DT type symptoms. 

If the Naltrexone works and gets me drinking way less, am I in danger of major seizures? I've got a limited amount of anti-spasm medication, which works on the days when I have the issues, but not enough for if it were to start being an everyday thing, and no easy route to get more. 

I really want to start fighting this, I just don't want to accidentally put myself in even more danger.",1

I'm in my mid 20s, a wife and mother of a PreK student. I work as a manager at a local food chain. I earned my Bachelors degree online about a year ago. I have been unable to find work in my field so I have decided to pursue my Masters degree. 
About two years ago my mom's dad, my grandpa, died of cancer. It was a hard loss for the entire family, completely devastating. My grandparents were married 52 years and everyone very much still depended on him. I was happy he got to meet my child but unfortunately my child was too young to remember him. Then about a year later my dad died of alcoholism. He abandoned our family when my parents got divorced and found someone new. His new girlfriend drank with him and they were drinking constantly. Everyone warned me about how rough he looked and everyone tried to warn him about his alcoholism. It didn't work he met his death just 8 months after getting remarried. My dad was an amazing man when I was growing up. He coached my softball team year round for years, he was so smart and funny. He listened to me and encouraged me. I have a hard relationship with my mom so he was always my go to. His loss was also very hard for myself and my siblings. Not to mention his entire family as well. 
Lately I have been drinking. I don't know if it is a way to cope. I feel like I'm in denial about these losses still. Rather than feel miserable about it all I just push everything down. Lately I have been hiding how much I've actually been drinking from my family. I know I need to stop. I know I need to make a change. It just feels so hard. I don't even know why I compulsively buy alcohol and drink it, it's almost like I'm in autopilot mode. Drinking doesn't make me feel better, I feel crummy. I'm always tired and sometimes hungover. I'm angry and anxious a lot of the time, I'm unsure what to do. I'm unsure how to make myself quit. Everything right now feels like a blur and despite being happily married with a great little family I feel alone and empty inside.

If any one wants to talk or more info on my recovery let me know.😁",70

I'm apparently ( and I only say apparently because sober I would NEVER talk or ask this way) am a complete ass and quick to anger. My family has alcoholism that runs through both sides of my family with both my grandfathers and my own father for a while when i was younger dealing with the disease.

I don't remember all of last night but what I do remember is the sheer number of people who were telling me to calm down and be civil. I remember talking very sharply and scaring my little sister's friend and i remember someone physically leaving the house because of my behavior.  All of that was before it was even 11 pm when I sobered up enough to realize I was an asshole and my immediate thought was how could I get more alcohol.

Even now while writing this and it's only 7 am I still want a drink. I'm scared of what I'm going to do when I'm drunk but at the same time I also drink because  I feel like my life sucks. Just this month I've had to go to a funeral for one brother, another is in the hospital I'm IN DEBT without a job ad no sign of one popping up soon again, I'm not n school my biggest support system is out of state and my therapist is literally too expensive for me since my insurance changed. All that within the last 2 months.

I'm scared ill end up like all the men I've looked up to in my life and angry at the world and at myself. I want to be a better person.  I don't know who to tell or if I should tell anyone at all. I'm scared of what ill lose if I ask for help from someplace other than the internet.

I didn't mean for this to become my own therapy session but I guess it's what I needed. Thanks for listening",2

For nearly the past 2 years I struggled a lot with drinking. As a girl with not much weight I was drinking 0,35-0,6 liters of vodka a night mixed with cola and other things. 

Well, last month I finally got a long overdue diagnosis for ADHD and got a prescription for Methylphenidate. I lied about my alcohol use because it would have probably denied a medication based treatment (or so was my assumption)

Well it’s 1 month later and with the exception of 3 ciders spread over the month I pretty much lost the need to drink. I walk past the liquor section and the rising urge is as easily crushed as it comes up.

I assume the withdrawals were asked because I replaced it with a different chemical sensation? I just wanted to share this with people who might understand. 


I can’t offer any wise words because I feel like I cheated my way to this... but I want to say to everyone here that I believe in you with all my heart and wish you all the best. For your loved ones, your health and your mental wellbeing.

Recently one of his employees (known to have a drinking problem, but functional until now) showed up reeking af of alcohol. My Husband didn't send him home right away, only after he witnessed him slurring at a customer some time later. After consulting HR they chewed him out for not telling the employee a reason and not firing him immediately.He is really torn between his responsibilty as a boss and his empathy for his employees struggle.

There is no question to what he is supposed to do as this is already been settled with HR, but more about how he can cope with this situation.",5

How do I gently help her taper off without involving anyone else?

Long version: For the past few months my wife’s drinking has become gradually worse to the point where she starts to feel withdrawal symptoms unless she has at least 2 shots a day.  She knows this isnt good and keeps trying to taper off, but she also keeps unintentionally sabotaging the process by drinking too much at work (works at a club) and when she goes out with friends. I cant even really blame her because she suffers from severe anxiety, depression, and ptsd and atm drinking is the one of if not the only way she’s able to have fun, but obviously it doesn’t change what its doing/will do to her body/mind.

I love my wife to death and will do anything for her. She truly is the best person I know, but She never wants to talk about it, telling me she’ll handle it and asking me to drop it. I’ve tried to, but it keeps getting worse. Im sure she hates talking about it because she feels embarrassed (she doesnt handle shame well) and im worried the other part is denial about where it might be headed, since she grew up at the mercy of multiple alcoholics. She doesnt want to tell her doctor or therapist for fear of being treated like an alcoholic by either.

So I guess i’m just looking for advice on how to gently talk to her about it and help her to properly taper off before it turns into 4-5 shots a day.",2

I would wake up hungover, drink my leftover stale drinks to help my hangover, go to work semi-drunk (I am a cook...).  Everything revolves around drinking.  My house was always a mess, I would buy 2 bottles of booze to make it look like I only drank half a pint, but in reality I would drink about 1.5 to a fifth a night. 

I was with my ex for 5 years. We were engaged 2 years. The last few years was me just drinking myself to sleep every night, him begging me to get help, but I didn’t give a fuck. Nothing mattered to me. I neglected the relationship, myself, my job, friends, and family. 

3 months ago we broke up. The drinking was too much for him. He couldn’t watch me drink myself to death. I came to terms with the breakup, or so I thought. But I ended up being so depressed with the breakup, I went to the hospital twice wanting to blow my brains out, both times my blood alcohol was a .35...I begged my ex to cal the cops and have them bring me to the hospital before I did something really bad to hurt myself. 2.5 weeks ago was the time I realized HOLY SHIT what am I fucking doing? My family and friends are so worried about me. I went into work so drunk my boss had to drive me home. 

Well that was it. I made an apt with a therapist I used to see. She had me see my doctor, and I got a shot called Naltrexone, and got put on klonopin. I had terrible withdrawals. Puking, shitting, shakes; all of it for about a week. 

My doctor interviewed me for at least an hour asking every question possible. We went through any and every solution we can come to. I almost didn’t go to the apt because I didn’t want to be sober. I’m so glad I did. 

Here I am balling my eyes out because I can’t believe I’m sober. It is so euphoric. Life is so fucking good. Alcohol is the devil for me. Please get help. Your true family and friends will be there no matter what. They love you. You will learn to love yourself. I’m currently going through a recovery book and learning about how to cope with feelings being sober. 

It gets better. I promise. IWNDWYT. 

Thank you for reading. I needed to write this out. I do have a journal that I recently have been writing in everyday, but fuck I want to help someone else who is in my position. Please message me. I will talk to you. I have been there. You are not alone.

I have a binge eating disorder which has put me in a bad place mentally the last few months and has been a struggle. I started throwing a lot of parties and drinking with friends pretty much every few days throughout January and February.

Now the interesting thing about me when I drink is that I can drink A LOT compared to any of my friends (college students) and regardless of how much I drink, I don’t throw any of it up. Which I’m guessing is awful since it all just stays in my stomach.

It got really bad this past weekend when I ended up getting blackout drunk on both Friday and Sunday up until 5am drinking (don’t remember much of Saturday or Monday either, was pretty out of it and still drunk up until the afternoon).

What’s scary is that I never used to want to drink to the point where I was that gone and I think my binge eating problem is now moving over to drinking as well.

Anyway the reason this is scaring me so much other than obvious alcoholic tendencies is how my body still feels now 2 days later. I feel completely out of it, unable to focus on homework, my body is tingly all over and numb, slight aches in my legs when standing up after a while. I’ve read into this and seems to all point to alcoholic neuropathy.

I’m planning to get checked out at a doctor sooner rather than later but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has experienced this feeling and been able to recover simply by stopping drinking? I heard effects can be permanent but surely that wouldn’t be the case for the first time I’ve felt this right? 

TLDR: binge drank a ridiculous amount this weekend and scared of the effects it’s having on my nervous system. Any advice/information appreciated, new to the community",3

I used the excuse for all my life “to go to sleep” but lately once I start I find myself drinking many drinks far past the time I should even be going to bed or until I don’t have an option but to go to bed. & It’s not a nice have fun drink either it’s a dark depressing self loathing drunk. It’s been happening almost weekly now and accelerating. 

And I’m sick of drinking away all my money. I’m quite depressed last few months / year, as depression got worse so did the drinking. I know it’s shit for depression and I know it’s shit for my health. 

When I stopped drinking for 7 days I lost my appetite completely, smell of food made me want to vomit only time I could eat was if I got super high and I could eat some yogurt maybe if lucky. I lost about 13 pounds in one week. I had extremely bad diarrhea body cramps etc and anxiety straight from hell. When I went to doctor he even recommended not quitting cold turkey as it can have some pretty serious side effects apparently. 
And I broke down and started drinking again because I was too weak to the withdrawal and I am addicted. But this is getting stupid and I’m being very stupid. 
If I’m going to do this not cold turkey thing I need to get control of this because I think I do have a problem. I need to quit cold turkey and deal with withdrawal or get my head out of my ass and limit myself and eventually quit. Any advice on the topic I’d appreciate on limiting myself or how to make withdrawal a little better. Either one or maybe your own story. Regardless I need to fix this now, I’m tired of it now, I’m done with this game.

His excuse is always, i dont do it to get drunk I drink because I like the taste.

Sunday night was our staff party, and I was having fun and having no issues until about 4am. I blacked out for an hour. During that hour I bitched out a coworker and made her cry, then proceeded to cry about a recent family death. It was messy. When I woke up I had very strong suicidal tendencies and actually thought about quitting my job because of the shame.

I always knew my relationship with alcohol is rocky but I’ve never blacked out and gone out of my way to hurt another persons feelings. I have no idea what I said to this day. Even thinking about it has me sick to my stomach. I haven’t been able to sleep because of how shitty I feel about this. I tried to reach out to her but she hasn’t opened the message.

I’m just not sure how to deal with this. I love a glass of wine at home and drinking after work is a really big bonding thing. But I’m not sure if I can trust myself anymore to drink anything in public. The last few times I’ve been drunk I’ve woken up feeling shameful. And I know a lot of it has to do with my emotional issues I’ve been having, but I’m working through those with my therapist and with meds. I also reached out to an addictions counsellor, but I’ve found that my will to stop is really weak. Both my parents are/were alcoholics too so the cycle and having it around is pretty hard.

Been drinking everyday for like 2 or 3 years and I want to stop. I need to know with all of the anxiety and depression if it feels worth living at that point. I drink mostly to sleep and after work to relax myself but at the same time i feel kind of depressed when i drink. I zone out and get in my head a little bit....but anytime i drink it helps me feel relaxed for like 1 or 2 drinks. After that my anxiety gets the best of me but i still crave getting more fucked up. I just need to know if i try and stop drinking for real if i will feel just as anxious and depressed or if the drinking has been the problem for the most part the whole time. Please help, i'm really desperate right now. My anxiety and depression make me not want to reach out for professional help. All i want to do is sleep after work and i live across a bar so it makes it even harder. I just know i want help but AA and actual therapy seems like such a big deal to me that i don't want to do it. I'm so tired all the time. Any advice will help. I want to die in the way that i won't have to deal with my anxiety anymore. But I still want to live the good parts. I don't know what to do",10

I then preceded to go upstairs and lose most of my motor skills. I was laying on the floor on my back when I realised that I had a small amount of vomit in my mouth, I tried to get up and go to the toilet but I was unable to stand so I decided to just swallow it and ended up choking. My SO was aware of this and had to scream at me to sit up and thankfully I did and it came out. I woke up this morning still completely wrecked and ended up being an hour late for work. I’m so ashamed of what I’ve become and even more ashamed of how I made my SO feel. Despite all of this, I still have the strong urge to drink and I can’t accept the reason why.

Back story, I've been with my girlfriend for about 6 months and things are great and I love her. The only issue giving me a reason to question if shes someone for me long term is she is an alcoholic which would not be something I want to be around long term.

She is a high functioning alcoholic though so she sees no issue with it. She has a good job, social, etc. But I've realized she uses it to mask deeper issues. I can tell she is depressed (as someone who has fought depression for most of my life, I know the signs). And also, she goes a little crazy when shes drunk and it's hard to deal with. 

For instance, Saturday we went out and in the span of maybe 5 hours she had 15 drinks with most coming in the last 2 hrs. She was pretty gone and getting her back home was an adventure. This isnt isolated to dates tho, she will polish off 2 bottles of wine on a random Tuesday night if she wants to. She doesnt drink out of boredom or anything, she just drinks. Every day. Multiple drinks. 

To make it worse, all of her family and friends are alcoholics too. I'm the only person in her life who isnt, but she's trying to convert me (shes admitted this). 

I'm worried about her health and her mental health. She has issues she masks with alcohol and it's taking its toll on her body which is extra bad because she has a fitness test for work coming up that would be much easier if she could lay off the drinking.

How can I talk to her about this or bring it up to her? What do I even say? Any thoughts out there?",5

I(23F) come from a family of alcoholics. I have my own struggles with alcohol and it's starting to take a toll on me. I have to stop completely. I've tried to talk to my mom about this and told her that I don't want to be completely sober I just need to cut down. I told her that I have it under control. She said to try to only have a drink on the weekends which sounds easy, but it's just not. I don't know why it's so hard to just NOT drink. I drink excessively knowing I have problem and I can't keep doing this to my mind and body. I confide in my mom about a lot of things but this is a sensitive subject because her dad was an alcoholic, my dad is struggling, and I don't want her to worry about me. All of my close friends like to drink, and I can't admit my struggles with alcohol to my SO. I feel like I can't find the right person to talk to about this. 

For me, there is no ""only drink on the weekends"". It has to be no drinking at all. I have finally come to accept that the drinking needs to end. I need to for myself, my mom, and all of my relationships. I don't know what I would do if I ruined any of my relationships because of my excessive drinking. I honestly don't know if I can do this.

I was feeling like my family would be better off without me so I reached out for help with Kaiser (local hospital group covered by my insurance) and was assigned a therapist to work with for the depression and an substance abuse counselor. After our initial meeting, the substance abuse counselor had me join a program that meets 2 nights a week for 2 hours to work with other people in recovery. 

The program was very scary at first because of my social anxiety. But I am 5 weeks in and it has been great and I haven’t had a drink in 35 days and I am starting to get comfortable with my group. Now I am being urged to attend at least 1 outside AA meeting a week (apparently this is a requirement to continue with my program). I am really uncomfortable with the idea because I am an anxious person and seeing new people at every meeting is going to be stressful. 

I went to a meeting this morning and there were about 15 men in their 50’s to 60’s in there. I am a 40 year old female and I immediately walked out because I felt horribly out of place. I get why AA works for people, I do. But I am happy with the group I am in and the treatment I am getting. It is working for me.

So my brother and I went to an AA meeting with him ([photo of him with his candle](https://www.facebook.com/events/2480731532052307/)). It was a cool experience and really special that he shared it with us.  
I'm a comedian, so,  constant travel, performing in nightclubs and getting paid in free drinks made my relationship with alcohol difficult. One night my best friend drove me home in my car while I puked out the window of the backseat. The whole time I was trying to say ""I'm sorry about this. I love you."" in between gasps of air. I drove the car to get detailed in the morning, and told the guy my friend puked to save face. It was pretty humiliating. I could keep lying to everyone but I knew the truth. Even while I was puking, I realized how annoyed my friend must be. and the next morning looking through my texts, I realized I was straining other relationships even if they weren't present at the night out.

After that night, I started writing a joke about drinking in moderation. I called it ""2 drinks is the new midnight."" -It's my dad's favorite joke and I thought I'd share it in here. Hopefully you'll get a chuckle and maybe even find some inspiration.

All the other withdrawal symptoms (aside from insomnia) seem to be gone. Has anybody come across similar problems during their first week sober? For example - I have been awake less than four hours this morning and already been there three times and each time there is a good deposit left to flush. 

I have no idea what I'm doing so yesterday went and bought bananas, mango, apples and avocado. I had been ordering fast food or restaurant food recently. I'm not deterred from keeping sober, just want a more comfortable way to make it through this. Any advice is appreciated.",1

Hello folks,

I joined this subreddit with the distinct aim of trying to understand my good friend better. I'll call him  Miles for now. 

I've known Miles for about 24 months. He was introduced to me by a mutual friend at a house party we were hosting. He was wildly drunk and out of control. We had a good laugh at his expense (not proud of this but that's the truth.) Whenever I'd hang out with my mutual friend, he'd bring Miles along. I didn't pay much attention to him to be fair, though did enjoy his company when he wasn't too disruptive.

Fast forward to 14 months ago. Our mutual friend's leukemia came back, he didn't last long. About  3 weeks in hospital till he died. A big shock for all of us and our community. I made it a resolution of mine to get to know Miles better. Our friend brought us together for a reason and I intend to honour it. 

I started playing DnD about 2 years ago. I started a campaign with Miles, his girlfriend and another friend. All 4 of us knew our friend who passed on and in a way this was our chance to become closer, honour our friend's memory and stay connected. It worked! After a year of playing, these 3 people have become really close friends of mine. They all have a place in my heart now, next to the love for our friend who has passed on. 

During our DnD sessions, Miles has been drinking (sometimes very drunk), caused problems and made other invited players uncomfortable. I tolerated it for a while, not really knowing how to navigate this behaviour. Now I am quite firm, if he gets too drunk and wants to continue drinking, we stop playing. I am very open with this to Miles. He loves DnD, it quickly became one of his favourite hobbies (and he doesn't have many.) Again, I'm not certain if this is the 'right' attitude to have. Once or twice, Miles has stayed and I've helped sober him up and continue playing. Other times we just finish early and go our own ways for the evening, normally we're all disgruntled and would have loved to continue playing though it's a line I'm not willing to cross anymore. 

I have a small side business growing herbs and teaching about their medicinal uses. Miles has come over to help me quite a few times and I've even paid him in cash/herbs for the work before. He's expressed an interested in learning some of my social skills (his main draw to drinking is because of social anxiety.) I can hold myself quite well in many awkward situations and have quite a calming presence when needed. 

He gave up drinking recently just before Christmas. He's expressed an interest in giving up multiple times. Tried AA, anti-psychotics etc. We asked him as friends if there was anything we could do to support him during the upcoming NY party to remain sober but he asked for 'no special treatment.' His sobriety lasted 3 weeks, with him drinking at NYs and not stopping afterwards. I've been away for 6 weeks now visiting family and he hasn't stopped since. 

When I come back (at the end of Feb) I want to try again and meet him on his level to help him quit drinking. A big motivation for him quitting in December was not to upset 'his new friends.' I was touched to be considered one of those people.

My questions to all of you out there:

\- How to navigate it when Miles doesn't want to talk about/draw attention to his addiction. How can I create space to discuss this with him? When he gave up recently, I asked him how many days he'd been sober. For me (having my own journey with addictions to video games), days of sobriety are something to celebrate and cheer about every damn day. Mile's response to my question was 'I don't want to think about it'. Knowing that counting the days can be a great tool for overcoming addictions, I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to someone not wanting to engage in this positive behaviour. Can I celebrate this with him without the shame or guilt that could come with it?

\- What was it that gave you the most support from your closest friends? I'm going to propose something to Miles when I come back: A regular time slot to come and help me work with my herbs. During this time I'd like to introduce him to meditation, maybe go running together, get lunch together. This is all something I'm willing to pay him for his time with me. 

\- I'm scared for Miles. He's drunk himself to the point of having seizures. I've said to his face I'm worried about him dying soon, that I can hear his clock ticking faster than those around me. Was this too direct? Too harsh?

I love this guy. He is a damn good role player too. Any advice would be appreciated. If you feel I've been on my high horse or too righteous in some of the things I've written - please let me know. 

I have a lot to share about navigating anxiety by using herbal remedies. If there's interest, let me know and I'll share with you all one day.

Peace and love to you all and your journeys

This feels silly writing, especially as you're all strangers and I've never actually looked to a community (or even any single person) for help with my problems. However, I think this may be a reason why I've been having the issues that I do.

I am ruining my relationship with my girlfriend of 13 years because of how combative, stupid and sensitive (yet simultaneously insensitive) I become when I drink. I have no off switch, so even when I intend just to have a few beers, I end up going out and drinking 12 or more pints by the end of the night, starting some stupid shit, embarrassing myself and waking up feeling like a moron and trying to reconstruct what the hell I did the night before.

I've reached my breaking point, and I can no longer justify drinking AT ALL because sooner or later it turns out the same way all over again. I'm quitting drinking entirely, and I don't have anyone to talk to about this in my personal life, because I've kept my drinking problem private (for the most part).

I don't really know what to say other than Hello, and that I hope I can look back on this post in a few months, and then again in a few years and finally point to the moment where I said ""Full Fucking Stop"" and got myself and my life back under my own control.

Thanks for reading. Any links, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",32

There was a time in my childhood that I remember was good, and they were sober. Great parents (Mom and Dad in late 60's now) raising two very loved children (Myself and my brother late and early 20s respectively) in a responsible alcohol consumption home. By this I mean a glass of wine at dinner for both of my parents and maybe a few beers on the weekend if there was a game on or something, but never anything out of control.

As I got older the casual consumption turned to abuse. My brother does not remember a time before this as he was too young. 

My teenage years were spent fighting an unwinnable war with them and my brother quietly shutting himself away in his room. I later found out that he too had seen this behaviour and succumbed to drug and alcohol abuse to escape the nightmare of his home life.

The incident that broke me was my mother screaming at me and forcing her car keys from me as she went to go drive drunk somewhere. I sat there all night, wrought with anxiety that she might hurt someone or herself, but she came back a few hours later and apologized and said she wouldn't do it again. I was fifteen. Multiple incidents like this lead me to believe that they could change, that they were sorry and that this won't be forever. 

I have given them so many chances over the years to show me this is not the issue it really is. I have tried talking to them, talking to therapists, talking to my brother to get them all help. I've pleaded and I've begged and they've said they'll change or it's not a problem (""it's ALWAYS been this way, anon"") but every time I go back I just end up getting more hurt than the last time I was there. It feels like a fresh wound. I'll distance myself and gather hope that things are better, but when I try to bridge that gap between us it just shows that time hasn't fixed anything but made it worse.

My brother is doing a lot better. It got to me when he said he was going to be just like our father. I opened up about my own two years of abusing alcohol and drugs like xanax. How I relied on them to escape my reality. I've told my brother that is when I realized that I don't have to become them. I've been mainly sober for over a year now and am able to control myself and have casual drinks. No more drugs, and maybe 1 or 2 drinks one weekend out of the month, max. Since then he has only been drinking with his friends on the weekends, never alone anymore unless it's one after a stressful day at work. I'm constantly checking in with him to see how he is doing and I believe this to be true. 

I am just so lost in where this leaves me with my parents. My family has never been close and my brother describes it as not really a family at all, just ""people he drinks with"". 

I feel so wracked with guilt because of everything they had been through in their lives, to be in that much pain and drink every day just to cope. Please know that they were never ever physically abusive to us. They are very kind and loving people when they are sober but the time spent intoxicated greatly outweighs the time spent sober. 

I am new to this sub and I would appreciate any advice, or just any words really. There is no one I can talk to about this in my daily life and I feel so lost. I haven't worked up the courage to go to any AA meetings because I feel like I don't belong there. 

TLDR: Parents have been alcoholics for years, I don't know how to help them. Tried getting help but they won't acknowledge the problem. I fear they are beyond help and I don't know where else to turn.",3

Sobriety has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. I have really bad social anxiety so I used drinking to cope with that since I was 18.

For some reason I'm pretty often feeling sick in the morning, and I never used to feel sick, ever. This morning getting ready for work I felt a little off, and ended up dry heaving into the toilet about five times (I never actually throw up). That's what usually happens, I just feel little green, and then dry heave a few times, and not long after that I'm fine for the most part. 

I know I shouldn't be drinking at all, it's not healthy, but I enjoy having a few drinks at night. 

Also more background, I cought the flu about 6 weeks ago, and was bed ridden for the better part of a week (it was the sickest/worst I've felt in maybe 8 years). That was the first time I felt sick. One evening I was feeling a little off, so thought I'd feel better if I had a drink. Had the drink, and immediately threw up. I didn't drink after that for 7 days while I was sick with the flu.  

Ever since then I've had this problem. Could this be a hangover from whatever I caught before? Along with the flu I had a cough, it was bad for 2-3 weeks, and I still have a small cough, but it's not bad. 

Also, when I say I never used to feel sick, ever, ... I know it's bad, but some nights I drank too much and blacked out, and I'd feel fine the next day. Maybe tired, but not sick. I'm not drinking that much, and I still get sick now. I know I should stop drinking altogether, but has anyone heard of this problem?

I'm trying to quit weed, and beat my insomnia into a dream. 

I've got new pills from the docs, Quetiapine.

2 days before I saw the doc I went on a half heavy night, a few pints of lager and then a few bottles of red while I was on a date. (It went well!)

I saw the doctor and have agreed to stop smoking weed, as long as I try to stay away from the weed, I could be prescribed the pills. (I have family members on this medication.) 

Since then it has been hell, sleep is ok, but my anxiety hit the fucking roof. Now I used to be an alchy most of my twenties. And this morning, after 2 showers, a green tea, a bike ride down the beach, still panicky as fuck.

I've now had a tinny, and my stomach churning and restlessness that I've had for the past 6 hours has come to a stop.

I'm now thinking in my head, after those bottles from the weekend, it wasn't just a hangover it's like withdrawal all over again??? I don't drink much anymore, except for that night.

And my question is, has anyone else had anything like this? If you drink too much, withdrawal just hits you ten fold?

I don't know. Confused as fuck, but feeling calm, so I've got that. 

I also know it's probably a combination of me stopping the weed at once, that weekend with the few bottles, shitty sleep, new pills. I get convinced by my ideas though, and I need your help for nay or yay? Is this withdrawal again, as I've experienced it all before? Or all in my goddam head.",3

Let me start by saying that I have been struggling on and off with alcohol abuse since 2017. Let’s just say I started abusing alcohol on and off during mid to late of 2017 to cope with hard times/ depression I’ve had. Eventually in 2018 I started drinking even more. There was a few times I even showed up to work still drunk given I finished off at least 12 drinks before I got up for work about 2-4 hours later. but I hid it pretty well for the most part. Although I stumbled and almost fell on my ass one morning at work and was asked if I’ve been drinking and of course I denied it. I drank 12 beers or more on a regular basis through 5 days of the week in 2018 and sometimes during my off days drink even a lot more. Like 3/4s of a bottle of whiskey and sometimes polishing it off. I didn’t even really notice the withdrawal symptoms I’ve developed from this abuse until late of 2018 to early 2019. That is when I really got the shakes, anxiety, and was paranoid about everything and then I realized that I really did have a problem, not mentally but also physically dependence wise. This kept up until mid 2019, let’s just say I was very limited on what I could drink through mid 2019 due to my line of work. I kind of got out of the abuse. Started to feel normal again. But as soon as I was able to drink without a limit, I picked up where I left off in late 2019. Now I know this is no way to live and I am actively trying to break that habit but I think due to my past alcohol abuse and recent abuse it makes it even more debilitating. Fast forward to present day, I’ve had a couple of weeks within the last month where I’ve had nothing to drink for 5 days, but then I’ve picked it back up again on the weekends. Been better at restraining myself from alcohol, but still indulge in 4 to 5 drinks occasionally on the work days to help cope with my massive tension headache withdrawal that make me feel lightheaded. Not to mention the anxiety. But that just resets the withdrawal symptoms for me. I’m in a position where alcoholism is heavily frowned so I have not been too outspoken about it since I don’t want to put my career and opportunities on the line. Guess I have to go in and power through cold turkey for a while. I understand withdrawals can be dangerous but this seems like the best way. Anyone have a similar experience when it came to withdrawals? What was your experience like?",1

Because the problem is Im better at quitting things cold turkey, but I’ve gotten to the point where I have severe withdrawals.

I’ve been hesitant to post on this forum because I’m so young, but I think I need to. I’ll give you give guys an idea of how this all happened:

It started when I was 18. I went away to college in NY for a semester and I did poorly primarily because I had poor work ethic and little understanding of prioritization.

Anyway, I suddenly started drinking because, well, it was fun. I would sit in my room and drink pretty much all day partially because my medication made me feel jittery and I felt like alcohol would loosen me back up a little to my more social somewhat normal self (though not exactly of course, I take my medication for a reason) and it did. I should mention that I think if I wasn’t on my medication (20mg vyvanse), I wouldn’t drink or do anything, and I don’t just mean drinking or any sort of narcotics, I mean I wouldn’t do anything at all. I wouldn’t even get out of bed in the morning if I wasn’t on it. That’s why I believe it to be the root of my conflict - If I don’t take it, I do nothing at all. If I do take it, I drink. It’s black or white.

I’ll be 21 next month. I’m not even legal and alcohol is ruining me, and I’m letting it. I don’t want to destroy my life, my body, or my brain this early in my life, I have my whole life ahead of me. Only one person has known this about me, and although we’re close, we haven’t talked about it for a year. No one knows - not my parents (they wouldn’t be able to effectively help me), my brother, my best friends, or my therapist.

I want to be my best self. I want to fall in love and have kids some day. I still am a kid, my brain’s not even fully developed yet. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, but I do know that I don’t want to spend anymore time letting myself rot. I can’t tell my family because I know, I really know that they can’t help me (should I mention the extreme tension between my mom, my dad - both 54, divorced and reluctant to begin another relationship because of their marriage to each other - and my brother, and I? And how I believe I may be the glue that holds our family together regardless of my own serious personal conflicts?).

I know that counting on this forum may not be the most formal/reliable method of overcoming my problem, I know you may not be psychiatrists and/or have all of the details on my problem (and I’m not looking for a diagnosis), but I think it may be helpful because of the different perspectives and advice I can get from you all. Everyone I know, I know well. Many of them would just disapprove or write me off as a problem instead of trying to help me fix things. I’m afraid they may think “you’re a problem” instead of “alcoholism is a problem for you and you need help.”

Again, I’m looking for advice (not therapy or psychiatry or any diagnosis), I just want to be able to overcome this so I don’t ruin my life before it even begins.

To anyone who responds - Thank you. I can’t tell you how much your thoughts and efforts to help mean to me. I’ll be taking every single response into consideration.

P.S. I’m a functioning alcoholic. It’s seldom that things get bad enough where I’m unable to function correctly (i.e. experiencing superfluous emotional distress, lethargy, or irritability) which may be why it’s been so difficult for me to stop.

TL;DR: I’m a 20 year old alcoholic looking for advice before I do any serious long term damage to my life and my body.",30

I got through the holiday period, but it was a minefield. Everyone wants you to have a drink and everyone wants to drink with you. It's 'no fun' you're drinking but the person you're with isn't, and all the rest of it. 

The pressure is on. And the best way I found to deal with this is with a ready-made list of excuses. Here are mine:

\- 'I've stopped due to 'middle-aged spread'. it just goes on my belly so I've had to stop.' - Usually leads to something like 'oh I'm sure you'll be fine with just one!'

\- 'I'm driving so won't drink' - anyone who argues with this is a git

\- 'I've got a bit of a stomach bug' - no one wants you to puke on them

\- 'I'm doing 'sober for <insert month here> so can't drink' 

\- 'I can't, I've got a race tomorrow' - this one works for me as it's generally true but again people will usually say things like 'I'm sure you can have just one then, can't you?' 

\- 'I've got a big meeting tomorrow so need to be clear headed'

\- 'I can't even have one as my will-power will cave in and I'll end up having more' - a little to close to the bone?

\- 'I've stopped because I've found myself drinking a bit too much recently and I'm worried it might become a problem' - again, getting closer to the truth

\- 'I'm on medication' - this is the best fit for all occasions

\- 'I've got an intolerance' - no going back from this one!

\- 'Even the slightest bit has started giving me terrible headaches the next day'

\- 'No thank you I don't drink alcohol' - usually ends up with 'why?' which is not what you want

\- or one I've never tried 'Unfortunately I'm a recovering alcoholic' - this is the toughest one",3

Only did I found out today that I wasn’t getting life insurance (I believe that’s what it was) and it list the diagnosis’s from the doctor’s notes. The thing that got to me was alcohol abuse in the diagnosis list. I ripped up the mail and threw it away so no one else can see it.

I never considered to have a problem. I have alcoholics in my family and I wasn’t like them with the drinking from when you wake up till bedtime. The rage and all of that.

However, looking back, it was going to grow into a bigger problem. I wouldn’t drink for relaxation or for the taste. I would drink to get drunk.

I haven’t been drinking due to paranoia of mixing with my medicines (thank you OCD for making me paranoid enough for that). I haven’t been counting days or anything. I know it’s been awhile. Probably a couple months or more.

I haven’t been craving it honestly. I’ve been honestly avoiding situations. Every weekend a group of people I hang around tend to drink. It’s really not fun hanging around drunk people while sober. Also, they will try to entice me to drink with them. So I haven’t been going.

I’ve been a pretty heavy drinker for several years now. I never thought of my habits as a problem until recently. I was talking with a girl whom I had dated for about 2 years and was trying to reconnect with. I vaguely remember her being extremely disappointed in me and saying she didn’t want to talk to me again. I vaguely remember because I was pretty hammered at the time. That really did it for me. I pushed away someone who loved and cared for me more than anyone ever has in my life, besides my father. 

That really was an enlightening moment for me. Im saddened by the fact that I can’t talk to her anymore, and even more saddened by the fact I can’t even remember specifically what she said the last time we talked. Despite that I’m thankful for what she did. If it weren’t for her breaking my heart I would have never realized the destructive path I was on. I looked back on the last few years and realized that days where I have not had booze were few and far in-between. 

So, I decided to make a change... for about a week and then I blacked out again. Which I’m honestly glad I did. It made me realize the benefits of sobriety even just a week of it far outweighs the destructive behavior I had. So, I need to stay on a good path.

There is no grey area with these people. I think I truly lay somewhere inbetween, which makes me not a true alcoholic.

Excuse my incoherence, this is the first time I'm trying to summarize my situation like this and I'm keeping the story intentionally vague.

I've been with my current partner for over a year. We moved together few months into the relationship. They had their flaws, but I believed that they genuinely wanted and tried to fix the worst ones and we even got engaged. I've never had a relationship with a stable person, so I thought this is just normal partnership issues. They have a child from previous relationship which I gradually started taking care of and got attached to. Even though I've always feared having a child of my own, I could finally imagine I could do it and it would even be great with this partner. They had a rough life, are diagnosed with a mental disorder and are in the process of detaching from their toxic family (which is a source of stress). I've started therapy and due to having to deal with my partner, I think I've become a better person, more understanding and tolerant, less egotistical.

The biggest issue is that they're an alcoholic. They know it, and since that one drunk night when they called off the engagement, they realized it's really an issue and they've started specialized therapy. But they make mistakes. I've been multiple times seconds away from ending it, but we always made it through somehow. Every time they drank, I had some excuse for them or they managed to say or do something that gave me hope. But lately I've been feeling like they're just going in circles and repeating the same mistake again and again.

I'm away for the weekend to visit my family. I asked my partner beforehand if they needed me to stay with them, but they said it's okay. We were texting the first night, they said they were struggling, but managing. Second day around noon, they text me they had failed and they understand if I want to move out. It did hurt, but after chilling out, I wrote they're a dummy and one well handled failure is not such a big deal. We had a really nice discussion about how they feel and everything seemed fine. They said they're getting someone to babysit to be able to relax and focus on their wellbeing. I voiced my concern about them being alone. They said they're not planning to touch alcohol. Then in the evening, they stopped responding to my texts (but they did read them). I'm almost certain they're having a drink night.

So here I am, so deep into the night it's almost morning and I can't sleep, my heart keeps beating like I just ran a mile, and I'm thinking through getting an apartment, wondering where I'm gonna live and store my stuff in the meantime, dreading being asked what happened by people I know, and trying to convince myself I'm not gonna stay alone for the rest of my life.

My partner says they love me and want me, but it's not enough for them to genuinely want to quit. We talked about that yesterday and it seemed like they were decided and excited to find their own way, but I don't feel I can take any more. I'm so angry, thinking of telling them they can't ever get any better if they keep making such basic mistakes, telling them they'll lose their child this way and many more hurtful things.

If my friends pass out I still fill the need to find a party so I can drink but I never feel the need to drink alone., I won’t allow myself to do that. Cause I see no benefit. 

My mother’s an alcoholic she lays in bed and drinks till she knows she will get caught by the rest of the family.  My dad supports her and she realizes she has no responsibilities besides paying bills. She refuses to eat. She flushed food down the drain when I try to make her eat. 

My dad drinks excessively but he’s a functioning alcoholic. He makes great money and never misses a day on the job and always shows up to his hobbies well prepared. 

Divorce is coming soon. I basically made my mom start going to therapy (4 weeks) and I thought it was working till she started closet drinking and blew a .22 at 3pm. (We bought a breathalyzer during her last bender). My mom goes to AA (or at least says she does).

I don’t want to end up like my parents. I only drink socially with my friends on the weekends because that’s what I’ve restricted myself to. constantly feel the urge to drink. I try to fill that void with eating right and going to the gym. But when I’m away my mom goes to the liquor store. I feel trapped.

I can quit addictions if I put my mind to it. I haven’t smoked pot in months, I only hit the juul when I drink, and I haven’t masturbated in over two weeks.",1

It's a week into February and I told my good friend about these nightmares I've been getting about drinking. For example, I dreamt a blonde shrunken head was screaming that I had to hide it behind a cabinet - but it transformed into a glass of whiskey.

I developed a sweet tooth since. Supplementing myself with chocolates and root beer. Stuffy nose and allergies are stronger and more prolonged. Haven't had night binge eating either. Parties and social gatherings are painfully sober. Getting back into a need to clean and organize. Possibly even taking apart stuff - broken hard drives, office chairs, computers, etc.

Sleep has been good. Hardly touched any Pepto-Bismal for that morning heartburn. Haven't had the need to doze off at work or call off ""sick"". 

I could easily polish a bottle of New Amsterdam gin almost daily but I'd switch it up a bit. Sake on Wednesdays. Jaeger on the weekends. Rarely whiskey - but rarely is relative to the frequency within the calendar month. Trash night, I'd collect the bottles and tuck it under the other recyclables. I guess I'm a high functioning alcoholic - yet I made the best and daring decisions in my life. I just needed it to sleep and forget.

I gave up coffee last year and still going strong. I'm hoping it will be the same with alcohol. Maybe next year will be Benadryl.",3

I'm in my late twenties and I work in a restaurant, I was very drunk before I even got off. I met co workers at another place after work to get a drink with them.

After that I did some dumb destructive shit outside before the police were called. This is about the time I started coming out of the black out. I was covered in blood from slipping out of my handcuffs and breaking the inside door handle in the back of the police car.

I haven't been to jail in many years. A couple days later there's a news station van outside my house asking for a statement. I decline. That night I see myself on multiple local news stations. I grew up here so I'm sure many people that I know saw this. I'm fucking humiliated and I can't believe this is happening.. I quit the new job the day after the news came out and have been laying low at home. I haven't drank since that happened about 2 weeks ago and have no desire to. I have no self control once I start.

I wouldn't even be drinking with friends, it was all on my own and getting completely black out drunk for no reason. There have been times where I was crying myself to sleep and screaming at the top of my lungs because my thoughts become really dark when I drink too much. The turning point should have been when the police came to my apartment about a noise complaint because I was crying so loudly. Since then, the drinking problem only got worse. I ended up skipping classes, still haven't found the motivation to get a job, and just started feeling worse about myself. 
The turning point was when I got way too drunk on box wine while I was in a call with two of my friends. They both stated that they were getting really concerned about my drinking problem and they think it's in my best interest to quit. They're not wrong. I don't even want to know what's happened to my liver at this point and if I don't stop, the next time I get drunk would be the time I get hospitalized or worse. So now my friends said they would be here to text or call whenever I got an urge to drink. I really need to get my life back together.

Alcoholism is beyond a disease. I've woken up from a blackout literally every single day for ELEVEN months. I'm exhausted. I wake up and commit to stopping, about to dump out all alcohol and give my roommate my wallet so I don't buy more, more strongly than I’ve ever felt anything and then, literally minutes later, the desire to quit fades and my brain reminds me to take another shot before work. You can handle 9 shots before work, it’s no big deal. Coworkers tell me I smell like alcohol and I feel so dead inside I don’t care at all. My mom gives me 30 days to move out and I still don’t stop drinking. I have no life outside of this illness, on days off from work I'm drunk by 6am.  I’ve been to jail twice from drinking related offenses, and the 10 minute ride home from work is insanely painful as I make my Uber speed so I can be home and take that first shot. It feels like it will never stop. I’m only 21 and I already drink enough to buy a 1.75 liter of vodka every 2 days and I get DTs when I stop. I make it three days before the withdrawal, insomnia, and insanely scary dreams drive me to drink. I just want this nightmare to be over. I miss being happy. I know it’s my own fault but I hate my birth family for all being drunks. I just don't know what to do as I can't afford rehab. Sigh. Thanks if you read all this shit",37

I spent weeks sober. Every single day I felt better, not only physically but also mentally.

When Friday/Saturday rolls around; I'm in full on drinking mode. To my friends it's not uncommon to see me consume 24 beers or more. And, if I decide to ""cut on calories"" I switch to vodka and coke.... Which is even worse.

2 weeks ago I ""decided"" enough was enough... But my subconscious mind didn't get that message I guess. 

I can go for days without any noticeable (other than attitude) physical side effects, but my mind always thinks about the next drink.

Last week was good, I only had a ""couple of beers"" (a 12 pack of light beer 3.8% alcohol by volume). I decided I would keep it to 1 drinking session per week...

Then I had a death in my closest family.

I went off the deep end.... I drank nearly an entire bottle of vodka.. Not the small ones. The 1.14 liter ones. I got very belligerent to my mom and dad and even my wife.

The next day I felt completely miserable and hated myself for it. So I decided that was going to be ""my last drink"". The past few days have been great. I noticed a significant increase in my desire to work out, focus on work, answering every question without doubt. I even directed and skated through 3 meetings without hiccup; with clarity and confidence.... I felt... Good. I was alert, I was happy, I was ""Sharp"".

But today my best friend who helps me with nearly everything (and mostly my sobriety) had to take some time off. 

I knew I didn't have to face them tomorrow (they can tell when I've had even the slightest amount of booze), and I went for it. I had my typical mid-week binge. I drank that 12 pack of beer.

The 3pm cravings were just subtle hints at first... ""Should I?"". But the I started to dwell on it; I was conflicted and it was all consuming every thought. I needed that drink; and I did. But now, I am completely miserable and know what I did was against my own will... Or atleast some part of my own will..

I know I'm an Alcoholic; but I cannot goto AA. I lead a very highly respected position where I work, and I do work alot of hours. There is no possible way I could manage the principle AA methodology of ""90 meetings in 90 days"".

How can I stop that overwhelming semi-conscious desire when there are no immediate consequences?

If there are no consequences my mind becomes completely consumed by the thought of the drink.",18

Sorry all jumbled. Day three and not sure what my goal is here. To stop?  To just stop daily drinking. Am i an alcoholic?  Idfk.",6

I'm using it to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel liberated when I get a buzz going. All of my inhibitions and ruminations stop and it feels great. But then I get a ""moral hangover"" the next day and the guilt and shame of having given in to drink again wears me down, which leads to the cycle starting over again.

When I was 15 my soccer coach and role model  died in a single car DD accident the morning before he was to coach us in one of the biggest youth soccer tournaments in the world. That scared me to death of the substance.  That is,  until I met my ex almost 15 years later.  (Who was currently pregnant with her rapist's baby)
 We had a very,  very bad breakup. We started drinking beers together, but this quickly ramped up to mostly drinking liquor (plus dabs all evening; plus the adderall she was taking since we met: she told me after 4 months that she takes this)  Before this,  I was the dictionary definition of a teetotaler. My family are alcoholics, but they never attempted to teach me how to drink, or give me tips regarding drinking.  

This allowed me to think it's okay to drink half a huge bottle of tequila until I passed out or got into an argument with the ex previously mentioned. 

Once we officially ended it (quit my job at her urging; i know this is my fault) I went on a two week bender that ended up in a hospital visit, followed by a brief stay at a mental health clinic. 

Since then I've been drinking about two to three 40oz of malt liquor per day. She's completely disowned me and I'm just at a loss.

To all of my fellow ""day oners"" yesterday, I hope you're here with me for Day Two!

Sorry for another long post, but I have so much to say I guess, I had to make a new one. Also so many of you said yesterday was your day one as well, I wanted to check and see how everyone is doing.

Here's a link to my day one post if anyone didn't read and is interested: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ey93k7/day_one_again/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


 Last night was hard for me, like always I was really craving a drink around 2pm, but I decided to take my dog for a walk to get my mind off things. When I came home I decided to do something I love but don't do much of because I can't when I drink: Read. I read a whole book last night. I was up until 3AM because no drinking often equals insomnia for me. But I woke up this morning, even with my aches and pains and only a few hours of sleep, I still feel better mentally than I ever do waking up with booze still in my bloodstream.

The hardest part is the pain in my body from my autoimmune disease, which is one of the many reasons I would self medicate. I especially have problems with my upper back and shoulders, and one leg that doesn't quite function right. But alas, I'm not getting any younger, these things will happen. I need to buck up and accept that alcohol is not fixing this problem, only masking it while making it worse. Today I'm going to make a healthy breakfast and go for another walk with my dog. Maybe I will read another book tonight. Heck, maybe I'll write a book, I have lots of time to do things when I'm not wasting half of the day being drunk.

I love you all, thank you so much for your support. I don't have any support in real life. In fact, I have many hurdles to face, such as a partner who drinks every day too, and still is doing so. Though I'm trying to convince them to quit with me, we all know that it only happens when the person is ready. But having a fridge stocked with beer sure takes a lot of willpower for me to avoid.

I can do it though. Just because it's here, doesn't mean I have to pay it any mind.

Again, thanks so much everyone. I am glad I found this community. I hope all of my fellow ""Day Oners"" yesterday can say this is Day Two. May we all get through today sober and wake up for day 3 tomorrow.

And remember, if you slip up, there's one thing I have always lived by and it's this:

""Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.""

Just dust yourself off and try again, however many times it takes, the only time you fail is when you stop trying.

 We can do this.",27

2020-02-04 03:54:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eyna34/withdrawals_or_regular_anxiety/,Withdrawals or regular anxiety?,"So, I am a 23 yo male with panic disorder and general anxiety disorder. But I've been ok for the last 3 years, but kept taking my meds to avoid a relapse. In the past I used to down two bottles of wine everyday for like 2-3 weeks straight, and used to be able to get back to my normal self after 1 or 2 days of mild anxiety and a little shaky hands. But then I had do cut back on drinking as the college started getting harder and harder. For the last 3 years I would say, on average I am drinking 2-3-4 days a week, an average of 5 pints of beer a night. With that said, there were times I stopped drinking completely for 2 weeks to 4 weeks, due to my summer job, travelling, or exams etc. And I do not drink spirits. But the thing is, this semester was the hardest one for me, and I worked really really hard and managed to make a 3.7 gpa. And I rewarded myself with partying for one week(this was three weeks ago). Upon quitting after binging for a week(six pints average a night) I felt like absolute shit, couldn't sleep because of anxiety, even 0.5-1 mg xanax couldn't put me to sleep. Keep in mind that this was the time I quit my effexor from 37.5(I've been tapering down for a year) and hit my head somewhere on the last night of drinking.(I do not remember it, had a little bit too much that night)

Anyways, being afraid of going thru withdrawals, I stopped drinking for a week again to check I how I feel, got a brain scan for hitting my head god knows where which came clean, and went back to taking my effexor to prevent relapse. And I felt fine 2 days after. My sleep was fine, as well as my cognitive abilities, my anxiety was gona in two days etc.

But last wednesday, I started drinking again(went to another town to visit a friend of mine), and binged for only five days. I mean I didn't even binge, just 5-6 pints of beers each night.

And now I am back home, having had my last drink 35 hours ago, I can not sleep because of sleep paralysis i keep having whenever i start getting off to sleep, and thus, I wake up with anxiety even before falling a sleep. I've had sleep disturbances, sleep paralysis, and anxiety all my life even before starting to drink.

So, do you guys think that I am going through withdrawals or is it just me being the anxious dumbass that i am just being myself and being paranoid.

Aside from sleeping, I have no other symptoms, my hands are steady, no anxiety when I am not in bed, strong apetite, solid stomach. I just can not sleep because of the damn sleep paralysis and anxiety/panic related to it.

And as from my previous experiences, having 5-6 beers a night for a week and then stopping shouldn't kill you. I thought it had to be months/years of heavy drinking to start talking about dt's.

Thanks.

Now he is currently back in my city where he stays at his moms as far as I know.
In person, I have never seen him completely wasted but heard stories from different people. When he usually comes to visit my city he would always stay at a friend's house who I visited a lot and he always had a few drinks as soon as it got dark and always stayed up late and sleep until noon. But he is banned there aswell. Years ago it was beer and wine and about two years ago he switched to gin. He sometimes messages me and others random texts in the middle of the night(1am - 6am),with the worst one beeing he will kill himself. Next day when I read it and called him he said it was just a joke. 

Now why do I think, although I am not as close to him as others, that I have the right/that it's my ""duty"" to help him? 
I have been in a similar situation a few months ago, although my addiction wasn't alcohol but video games. I went to rehab where most people were alcoholics or addicted to pills and from my experience, we are all not that different and reach to our substance for similar reasons. So I do feel that I understand him to a certain point and help him by going to the same clinic.

Yesterday I sent him a long text message that he should consider rehab, I want to help him, share my experience in more detail with him than before, answer all his questions and how it affected me and was the best decision I have ever made. And I will not tell anyone about this. (Which is true because it's a not so easy topic) 

That was probably not the most clever move but I just said fuck it, I have to be honest to him and just tell him straight away. That's how it worked for me when friends and family sat me around a table and confronted me. 

I sent him that message at 9am, he read it a few hours later and I got a reply the next day at 2am. 
Of course he denied it. His answer was that he doesn't know who's spreading those rumors and that he was at a hospital in his son's country and he came back to my city to get a better diagnose. (This is true to some point since he had an issue with his pancreas years ago, and still does apparently. What a coincidence...) Also he asked if his brother spread those rumors, that he is an alcoholic and that his brother is just jealous of him. 

I must agree that his brother is a heavy drinker aswell but he has his life together! 

Now I don't know what to do further and how to answer on his last message and especially how to   help him accept it. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope that you can help me! Thank you very much!!",2

My parents have been alcoholic my whole life, my mom wasn't as bad as my dad. Or at least I dont think, thats what it seemed like growing up. My childhood was very tough. When I was about 14 my mom through my dad out, because he was an alcoholic and couldnt hold a job. A few years later he died due to alcoholism.Ever since my parents split up she immediatly introduced this shitty boyfriend, they were on and off, she had random guys over all the time. All of them were alcoholics too by the way(she knew how to pick em). This boyfriend is a piece of shit, she only uses him for money and because I think shes scared to die alone or is lonely. I moved out before I was 18 because she became much worse and treated me horribly after my parents split up. I loved her my whole life, till she started treating me like she streated my dad and mentally abused me. Our family and friends have said shit to her, didnt matter. Its been almost 3 years since i moved out, I dont know how she is doing exactly because i dont live with her. But i see her and talk to her everyweek because we get along now that i dont babysit her and put up with her shit. Some examples (passing out everyday, never cleaning up after herself, almost lit the house on fire, screaming at my for no reason, etc. ). I assume her typical shit is still going on, because she does call me drunk often(not angry). She is currently with this same shit boyfriend who doesnt help her at all, brings her down, makes her unmotivated to get her shit together. Today i went over and shes passed out at 5pm and couldnt barely even talk to me. Shes diabetic, overweight, doesnt watch what she eats, and drinks all day, i worry about her constantly. Since i moved out ive been telling myself i cant help her because shes stubborn and doesnt want to help herself. But i think about my dad and wish i was old enough to understand and help him at that time. Im old enough to help my mom, but i just dont know how. She doesnt have a job(disabled), her friends all go to the bar, going out is actually her hobby, this shit boyfriend she uses. I want so badly to help her and I dont know what i would do if i lost her, im worried its going to be in the near future. 
Anyone have advice on how to go about this?
I figured one day shed hit rock bottom, but i think shes hit that a long time ago and multiple times. I think she knows she has a problem but doesnt care because she has nothing to look forward to, her depression doesnt help that.
Any advice i would appreciate. 
Any questions feel free.

Probably the biggest fight we’ve gotten in, and family got involved. I was blacked out through a big portion of it, but I do know I said some pretty awful things. 

I’m positive that if I don’t make some major changes starting now, I’m going to lose my partner for good. I’m honestly worried starting now might be too late. The problem is, is I feel this weird shame about admitting I need help and that I realistically probably need to be in a program like AA. I’ve dabbled in it before, but I always felt embarrassed by it and kind of out of place. The idea of not drinking again also makes me feel kind of, well, angry. 

I guess for right now, I’m just looking for some advice to handle this weird shame so I can get the help I need. Also, just some general advice for getting through the first few weeks of this.

Last January I quit cold turkey after being a 15 beer a night drinker and I started taking care of myself again. I got on medication for my depression and started feeling a bit more positive, everything was on the up and up. 


But then in July of last year I did a backslide and fell off the wagon when a very disturbing event occured that turned my life upside down. It literally broke me mentally and I lost my mind for a while.

I suffer from PTSD, bipolar and anxiety disorder, among other things. I was also diagnosed with lupus last year. 


I have been drinking almost every day since last July. I have an app I use (AlchoDroid) which tracks my consumption and BAC when I am drinking. I have to keep track of this because I have a tendency to just drink until I black out and then the stupid stuff happens and I make life harder for myself. Is that the sign of a professional alcoholic? Keeping track of your intake so you can still get hammered without getting yourself into trouble? It's sad really. 


A couple of weeks ago I received yet more bad news that made me want to drink even more. The most important person to me in the whole world might have lung cancer.


 But I am at a 200+ beer a month habit. My body hates me, my stomach is a mess and I hardly eat, I'm getting sicker and weaker, and I'm also bleeding internally in my lower GI tract. Honestly if I didn't have someone in this world to live for, I'd probably just let it consume me.


But I can't. I can't keep doing this to myself. I've got someone here who needs me. And not this ghost of a person that barely makes it to 3pm before cracking a cold one. Not this depressed, sick person who can barely get out of bed some days. I owe it to those I love, and to myself, to start caring again.


And step one is getting sober. Starting now. All of the booze from last night is out of my system. My blood is alcohol free. I know that craving is gonna kick in around 2pm, but I can fight it. I know I can. I've done it before. 


Today is day one. Again. 

Wish me luck.",75

Anyone have any stories of dumb shit they did while fucked up?? Laughs would be nice, and anything to help me feel like not such an insular fuck up.

Edit: update - I just spoke with her and she is \~strongly urging\~ me to take a semester off and get more intensive treatment before I can come back in the fall, provided I can pass regular drug tests. It fucking sucks, but I also know that it's what's right. Thanks for the comments guys!",64

I like my brain being active, alert and sharp all the time, except when I sleep. I drink water a lot which keeps my brain active and conscious. I feel often little semi conscious/high for few minutes after waking up from a deep sleep after caffeine crash or when I take cold medicine. It is only way, I know how being high feels like. I always wonder why would people want to lose their brain activity temporarily or be unconscious or high?

Edit:
Why did I ask this?

I am sorry. I am from south India, where the state government runs the alcohol business. The government makes a lot of money in this particular line of business and they always have profit targets during each festival season. The private companies supplies the drinks to the government and privates are not allowed to sell here.
Because of this a lot of people are alcoholics. Like minimum 20 million people out of the 70 million population, have to drink everyday. There will always a bar attached to the shop for the people to consume alcohol there. Even movies glorify alcoholism. 
Government cannot get rid of it due to the dependency on the profits to run the government and provides police protection to the shops during protests to close the shops which are nearby schools and highways and religious places.
I have seen many families losing their family members due to alcoholism. Most of them are men who die young leaving their wife and children alone. Unlike western countries remarriage is very unlikely. So, single mom's have to struggle in the society to raise the children.
Growing up witnessing this, I have this hatred towards alcohol. My father is an occasional drinker (like monthly once few pegs) and I don't like it. He can stop that but he would not. I wondered what makes people crave for being not in active mind. That's why I asked this question.

I'm now at a point where I binge for three days once every two or three months and otherwise don't drink. When I drink, my liver area usually hurts after for 1-7 days.

I’m not really sure.,"To preface, I’m in my 30s and live hundreds of miles away from my family. So my mom’s drinking doesn’t exactly immediately affect me. 

Backstory: my parents were pretty young when I (oldest) was born. Mom drank a lot. I don’t remember much about it except that I would run to the kitchen to get her beer while she watched tv all night and I was late to kindergarten just about every day bc I couldn’t get her up. 

When I was about 7, she got clean. Did the AA thing. Every day for years. She didn’t drink again as far as I know until about 8 years later. Short stint of daily drinking. Nothing insane. I was in high school, so I avoided the family most of the time anyway. 

Then went back to AA. This was probably in 2002. Didn’t drink again until 2009/2010. Drank daily. This time it lasted like 1.5 years. 

She started calling me regularly to talk while she was hammered. Which, totes fine. Until she’d get so sad because she “was a horrible parent” and she fucked up bc my brother and I aren’t religious or whatever. Basically anything to be sad about. 

Goes to treatment. Gets sober again. 

Started drinking yet again about 2 years ago. This time it was way worse. She got to the point where she lost her job of 10 years because she was drinking at work. She had a water bottle full of straight vodka with her at all times. Needed it on her night stand so she could have it upon waking to avoid shakes. Passed out drunk every single night. 

This time, she called me often again. Mostly to complain about her fucked up family, my dad, etc. 

It got bad. I thought she was going to die. My dad thought she was going to die but basically gave up trying anything to get her to stop. 

She goes to the dr, who said she was basically inhaling alcohol at night and she was 100% going to die. Freaked her out. She went to treatment for a month in September. 

I just talked to her today and she said she’s been drinking for a few weeks again.

I feel horrible bc she’s obviously dealing with some shit. My dad has to essentially watch her kill herself. 

Idk what to do. I won’t cut her out of my life. But I’m mad. And just horribly sad for my dad. And her. I drink, so I get the appeal. But fuck. Don’t know how I should even deal with her or these feelings.",2

Told him that I am quitting and feeling good about it, he just said ""That's good"". He was drunk on the phone.

We have been really close since we met few years ago on a job, worked on the same team. Both of us heavily drinking and smoking pot at that time.

We immediately recognised a friend. The conversation always free flowing filled with joking and laughter.

Now when I was on the phone again after few weeks since I last talked with him (We talk regularly on the phone because we have now a few thousand km between us) and being first time sober and not even wanting to drink, I honestly felt sad for him.

There was no proper discussion, he was too drunk to make any kind of understandable sentence. It left me wondering if our relationship had always been like this. Maybe we found ourselves on some other level that words didn't matter so much and our ""conversations"" had always been like this.

In the office we didn't really interact so much, since most of the time both of us was having a proper hangover and if we talked about something serious, it was mainly if we go and take a beer or two (or maybe 10) and smoke pot after the office hours.

It makes me wonder really that what has that been worth, I mean I really like the guy and he has been there to help me out in tight spots on life, but imagining myself on that state aswell is not a pretty picture.

I hope he could stop aswell...",7
