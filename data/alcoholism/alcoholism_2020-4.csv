I'm not an alcoholic but I'm 20 years old and grew up with my alcoholic father who sadly passed away at aged 51. I forgive him and I will always love him. Because while he lost a lot in his life, he was suffering. I could see it and feel it in his actions. It broke my heart. That's what hurt me the most. Not the police visits, not the social workers, not him toppling down the stairs on Christmas day. No. His pain. In my life, I've felt deep suffering and I'm writing because I don't want the person you are to be wasted. My dad was an alcoholic, yes. But that wasn't who the real him was. He was kind, caring, funny, extremely intelligent and had so many talents. He never truly got to appreciate them like I had the pleasure to. He never got to fulfill them like I wish he had. I can only imagine the quality of his life if he had. He never gave himself the chance. Please, I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but I beg of you to give yourself that chance. You are strong, you deserve to live a life of happiness and success. This isn't a part of you, this isn't who YOU are. I believe addiction is born through habits/actions. I don't want to start trying to be a therapist but this suffering that's eating you up right now? You don't deserve it. Not one bit. There's a wealth of potential to you. Please, let yourself and the people who love you see it. God knows I wish I could've seen it in my dad",12

Honestly, I didn’t think it would do much. I thought many of the medical benefits were pothead propaganda to push for recreational legalization. 

Here’s the expected benefit: it relieves my anxiety, insomnia, and back pain. Here’s the weird thing: *I have no desire to drink*. It completely killed it in me and I’m absolutely bewildered. I’ve had a twelve pack sitting in my fridge for three weeks after eight years of cravings. It just...doesn’t seem interesting. 

Just an idea in case anyone has access to *legal* marijuana. I’m not here to push for weed or even suggest it’s a healthy lifestyle but it’s a hell of a lot better than drinking. 

I checked the rules but didn’t see anything other than a reasonable ban on medical advice but since weed is available both medically and recreationally depending on your region, and many people are willing to use it illegally, I felt this was acceptable. My apologies if it isn’t.

Does anyone else hide stuff when they're drunk?,"On day 10 now and I still can't find my keys or my wallet, I must have hid them during my last 4 day binge to insure the next morning I would be able to go buy more alcohol. I'm so frustrated with myself this isn't the first time this has happened last time they were lost for 3 weeks. I finally found them in a pocket of my husband's shorts folded in his dresser drawer.

 I hid things in the oddest places when I'm drunk. One time I hid a carton of cigarettes in my garage.  I found them a couple months later just by accidentally running across them. Uggg! 

I tried to have new keys made for my Tahoe (this time) but the dealership told me they need the vehicle there so they could program the chip to the truck. Uggg! So now I have to pay for a tow and for them to cut a key.  Chalk another up for me due to my stupidity! 

I'm glad I'm sober today but... I have to admit I've been thinking about drinking all day today to escape the shit I have done. I know drinking will only make it worse, I tell myself I can just have little to escape for awhile but I know that will not be the case. I've been down that road to many times. I won't be able to stop once I start! 

So...  today I will not drink! I will continue to look for my keys and find a way to fix what I've done. I know things could be alot worse. 

 It is hard though!! I'm trying to be strong, I can give good advice but its hard for me to follow it. I'm trying to say I know better, but the urge is building up. I'm trying to think positive. 

So... I will repeat, I Will not drink today!! 

Hope everyone is doing okay, take care!",1

I went through a rough time in the past couple of years my marriage ended and my father was diagnosed with a severe terminal illness. I coped by hitting the bottle to blackout at least three times a week I treated people like absolute dirt and not one of them deserved it. I have clinical depression and wasn’t looking after my mental health whatsoever. Drink turned me into a person who I don’t even know and I feel like I have lost the past 9 months of my life to it (I barely remember anything in this period) I get flashbacks to how I behaved and I am mortified because it’s like I was demon possessed while on it although during this time I thought I was great and enjoying myself. I hit rock bottom and was extremely suicidal, went cold turkey and Friday will be a month since I last drank. Basically the point in this post is to vent and apologise immensely for my behaviour and pushing the most important people to the point of no return to my life, I’m sorry alcohol was more important than you all. Even though I know these people won’t be on here to read it. All I can do now is continue in my recovery and hope and pray to stay sober no matter how hard it is with all this guilt and shame. x",30

I’ve been casually drinking pretty often for about 5 years but much much more in the last 2-3. I haven’t gone a single day without drinking this quarantine. Not one. Averaging 6-10 drinks a night, sometimes more. I feel bad how often I go to the liquor store because i should really be staying indoors. It’s not new either—I’d been doing this on work nights and weekends alike, but lately I’ve been feeling more entitled to it because I’m laid off and have nothing else to do. Normally I may try to stop myself, but when I have tried, I wind up feeling almost like some kind of mind-control is going on; it’s like I can’t stop myself from going and getting more booze and drinking it. I just have to do it. Like I just have to have /something./ 

My partner says I act pretty normal drunk. I don’t normally black out exactly but I will sometimes see a text convo or social media post from the night before by me and be surprised. Basically, when drunk, I just get kind of annoying in my opinion, but not too different than sober me and nothing that raises alarms for anyone else.

I can’t imagine not drinking, at least sometimes. I still think that one day, after some therapy, I’ll be able to drink casually and not go overboard. I don’t feel like AA is right for me for a couple of different reasons. But I would like to know more about other possibilities, and also if there’s maybe a support group for people wanting to get sober but haven’t gotten there yet. People just trying to make strides but not going all or nothing yet? Because if it’s all or nothing I’m simply not ready, but I want to do something.",2

It means you should suck it up, grow up and become a parent instead of a child in this family. You say you want an open and honest environment. But when i tell you how things are you dont change. Dont expect me to continuously be vulnerable again and do all this emotional work to express myself over and over again, just to not be heard. You tell me i work too hard, i keep the bar too high. No. You just keep your standard so low that to you someone who does things because they are the good thing to do, even if you dont feel like doing them, seems like a high standard. Thats the standard for a good life. You just dont seem to understand. I dont ask for much. I cook my food, i work for my money, i clean my things. I just want to feel at ease and at home.

I need a buzz going to deal with the constant, crippling feeling of emptiness

It’s just gotten worse after I entered my 30s. Over the past couple years I’ve worked in software consulting and I can work most days remotely. 

So I spend practically all but 1 day (pre-quarantine) working from home. I work 50 hours a week on average - usually more because I’ll stupidly plug my laptop on weekends to “stay ahead of the game” because I have a general idea of what deliverables are coming up for the next couple of months based on what’s been planned. 

I’m also doing another degree part-time on the side, but thankfully I’m not going to have to visit that for another 5 months because I wrote my last final this morning.

But lately, the drinking has gotten so so bad. I joke about it to people but I legit feel like I can’t go through a week without hitting the bottle. Pre-COVID I was drinking 2-3 nights a week but now that’s surged to 5. Some nights I don’t even remember when exactly I fall asleep even though I only sleep 4 hours during the weekdays on average. I can’t stop drinking until I get a buzz going even if it’s done casually amongst other things.

The only exceptions I make are usually Friday nights because I observe Shabbat and try not to drink or take any intoxicants. Drinking wine is customary per Jewish traditions but I usually only stock up on beer and hard liquor.

I have a history of addiction. Been clean from hard drugs for 10 years now after an OD on opioids that took me to rehab. But being locked up at home all day and not seeing my friends or girlfriend has just reinforced all my past tribulations. I can’t stop thinking about all the pain I’ve caused people in my life and how badly I’ve strained relations between myself and members of my family. 

There is barely an evening that goes by where I don’t I just wish to stop waking up the next morning. It’s usually when I start drinking.",12

I have a good friend of mine whose drinking habits have always seemed to me to fall more towards the unhealthy side, but recently in the past few months, I am seriously concerned that he may be exhibiting early signs of alcoholism. If this is the case, I am absolutely clueless on how to approach the situation or if I should (more on that later). I am posting mainly to get feedback on if my concerns are legitimate or if I may be reading too much into things. To preface, we are in our early twenties and very much in the college/ party scene stage of life where everyone around us drinks/ goes out a lot. I am a social drinker through and through/ never been much of a partyer- I really don't drink that often and as such wonder, if I am being too harsh on him, as he does drink/party considerably more than me but obviously that does not mean someone is an alcoholic. Below are some things I have noticed/ he has said:

\-Drinks alone frequently/ 3-4 nights a week

\-Has been drinking almost every day while quarantined

\-Everything we do he would like to drink while doing it (movies/ bike rides/ going on walks etc- doesn't matter the time of day.)

\-It is rare that I have seen him drink without getting drunk (doesn't matter if we are at a party/bar where everyone is drinking or he is the only one in the group drinking while hanging out in the afternoon)

\-Frequently blackouts when drinking

\-Not remembering long phone conversations we have had (I typically realize he was drinking during those later)

\-Made a joking statement that he's ready for quarantine to be over because he can't come up with a good reason to not start drinking at noon

\-It started raining on a drive we were on the other day and he said it was a sign to make a drink when he got home.

\-Does an activity while drinking so he can consider it ""productive""

\-Has a family history of alcoholism

Again, he's young and in the college phase and I'm wondering if it's just that/ the environment he's in- or if he is actually showing signs of alcoholism. Any feedback is appreciated. If he is showing these signs, what can I do as a friend for him/ what are helpful things your friends did or things you wish your friends did in the beginning stages?

Thanks in advance!",1

I will say that I'm a highly functional, hardworking young man. So as being such, i always viewed My drinking as impressive and not a problem. Whenever it ruined relationshops or pissed friends off, i would just have a 'fuck them' attitude.       

So beginning this summer, the last lap until I was 21. i started reaping some gnarly symptoms I'd never felt; puking up bile in the morning, actually having pretty bad alcohol withdrawal, actually having wicked hangovers, just getting absolutely shitfaced for no reason, puking up blood. Ofc the arrogance in me blew these symptoms off. But shit has finally hit the fan..

Last Saturday I woke up with the absolute worst stomach cramps I've ever had. I like to drink smoothies for breakfast often, so i made one, drank it, hoping it would settle my stomach. Didn't do much, about 45 minutes later I was violently puking, shitting. I yaked probably 10 times that day into the late evening. Stomach cramps stayed, got some of  the most painful body cramps I've had as well. After i stopped puking i drank so much Gatorade and water that night, and cramps didn't get better. Didn't sleep a wink that night, sweated my ass off, had chills. Honestly thought i had food poisoning.  

The next day my cramps were still extremely painful. I was drinkin so much Gatorade and water but literally couldn't pee, was super bloated. Hurt like a motherfuck to even move, let alone walk. Thinking it was food poisoning I figured itd get better. I went downstairs to lay down, it's honestly  comfier than my bed. Was talking to my roomate and i could barely focus on what he was saying. He encouraged me to go to the ER and drove me, i never would've gone on own and props to him because doctors told me if I hadn't come in id die. I've been on IV's for 8 days, barely allowed to have water, can't eat. Doctor just told me my pancreas is so inflamed it's causing my colon to swell and fluids collecting in my lung.

I'm fucking terrified. Has anyone had a similiar situation? Idk what to do I'm so scared, this fun habit of mine has really stabbed me in the back.  Will i ever be able to casually and safely have a beer w friend/family again?? What peoples thoughts/reactions?",44
2020-04-27 14:08:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/g95z3y/alcoholism_is_a_trip/,Alcoholism is a trip.,"So, I'm a 32 year old male with a little over 3 years of recovery. The peak of my alcoholism was spent living at my parents house as they were the only people willing to put up with my shit. My parent seeing me so out of control made my mom spite alcohol and my dad really refrain from drinking much. Now, I'm doing so much better in life and have my own little back house my parents converted while I was away at a sober living for a year. One situation that has arose in the chaos of the Pandemic was that my dad has been noticeably drinking a lot more than before. It's to the point that even though I don't live in their house, I've caught my dad sneak drinking in the backyard. He's hiding beer, I'm finding a bunch of 24 Oz cans each day I go throw  away trash and yesterday when I was in their kitchen, my dad had a tequila bottle in the fridge. This triggered me to ask my mom how my dad's been doing and she said that he's been drinking every single day for a while. Apparently, them living together all day through this pandemic has them fighting a lot more and my dad is resorting to drinking all day to relieve his stress. I had a talk with him about it and told him that these were the exact things I was doing when I was drinking and that he should be vary cautious and that I'm starting to worry this is becoming a problem. Anyway, the conversation didn't go far of course. He denied having a problem. This is alcoholism though. It's crazy to me how now that I'm sober, I'm seeing my 66 year old dad having the same problems with alcohol as I was having(well nowhere near my extent, but it's still worrying as he's obese and a diabetic) I don't need any advice, but just needed to say this out loud.",4

My entire family suffers from an addictive personality, and I fear that I have inherited that from my father. I am simply asking for guidance as to how to stray from this behavior. I know that when I do drink, it feels like I am the best person ever, but I know it isn’t true and I need to face reality. I have dealt with many troubles that I do not wish to disclose and just want advice to find alternatives to alcohol which will bring me joy and fulfillment.

2020-04-27 01:40:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/g8ule8/facing_the_truth_by_changing_perspective/,Facing the truth by changing perspective,"I've been sober for 60 days. I'm proud, but I already did that more than once. For me, it's not quiting that is hard, because I always quit when I'm so disgusted of alcohol (and weed) and myself that it makes it ""almost easy"" to cope with the withdrawal symptoms. 

What is hard to me, and also what's frightening me the most, is that little voice that says ""ok now, come on, it's been months, you never had a problem with alcohol in the first place, you were just depressed and that's why you were drinking too much, but now you're so happy with your life that if you drink you won't need to fill yourself up until you're wasted, because you have nothing to escape from !
You can have a few drinks, just to have fun with your friends. You gained so much control, you will be fine, you won't even want to get wasted because you found balance and inner peace "".

And guess what, the first time it's fine... the second also... and that makes me think that little voice was right ! maybe the third... but, soon, I lose control again. Slowly, drink by drink, through days or weeks, until one night I can't control myself and I end up risking my life, drinking way too much, blackouting and drunkdriving or doing a terrible thing. Again. How many times I could have get myself or my loved ones killed? I have no idea...

But now, I know where that little voice comes from. I'm scared that I can't enjoy partying or even just having a nice time without alcohol. I tried to pretend I could, but I get bored when everybody is drinking, because even if they're not completely drunk, as I used to be, I'm not in the same mood, I'm not interested in the same things than them. I'm bored, and I feel boring. And I used to think that was depressing, that I would never be able to have fun again.

But you know what ? I think actually it's okay. It's fine that I'm not having fun with this anymore, because if (almost) everybody needs alcohol to enjoy it.... it's because it's not that enjoyable at the first place ! If I need alcohol to enjoy something, it just means that it's not REALLY fun, interesting or pleasant. It's just easier to drink to lower my needs of interesting, passionating activities, it's easier to drink and enjoy doing something easy, than to move my ass, to activate my brain to find something I ACTUALLY enjoy. And it's frightening to do that, because it means that I have to find something new, something I don't know yet, and to work for it until I enjoy it. And the thing is, it takes time to enjoy something. Whether it's playing an instrument, painting, climbing or whatever, you don't start to like it immediately. No, it takes months, years, it takes practice and boring hours of you being persistent, until you make progress and you become good enough, or used enough to it,  to actually start genuinely enjoying it. 

And it's hard, and it doesn't sound fun or easy, but to me it also sounds better. I don't want to go back to my useless self, and I don't want to be that person.... the fun, crazy, tough girl that finds her fake sense of power and assurance in alcohol, and her fake feeling of calm in weed. 

I want to actually find things that are worth my interest and my time, and I want to work for it, I want to fight for it even.  
Do real things that I will be able to share with my kid. And I will enjoy the ride to it, but it will not be the easy fake joy I used to feel when I thought it was normal that the ""best moments"" were the ones I could barely remember. I'm not going to let my memories and my energy fade away because I'm scared and lazy, I'm gonna stick to this road.

I'm okay with it now, it's okay not to have fun.",7

I am 28, ftm trans unable to continue transition in the current climate, unemployed, in the middle of a divorce that was not equaliy wanted(i still love him but he does not return the feelings) and living with my family. This includes my 30+ brother who is equily unemployed and alcoholic. 

I do not drink every day as i dont quite feel the need to and only buy alcohol when i have another reason to go out shopping and have the extra funds. However if i do have extra money i usually use it to buy alcohol as oposed to other frivolous things such as snacks or fast food. I also only buy enough for the night to drink and not more as i both dont want my mom to find it and i dont want my brother to drink it in excess. However should i have the funds i tend to drink once a week or more, along with buying my brother alcohol as i would feel guilty not sharing with him and feel it is unfair to drink infront of him(backwords thinking i know)

I have fought with the worries of being an alcoholic before and it runs in my family deeper than just my brother and i find it an escape from darker feelings. I am currently drinking as i write this and am feeling particularly lonely. I want help but cant see a doctor as i have no insurance. I have a history of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts(though no action) and i guess i just want words of encouragement especially if anyone in the lgbt+ comunity is facing similar dificulties.

If this just sounds like im depressed this will be my only post but if you agree i have a problem let me know. Thank you for reading and helping out.",2

But this week, my teenage daughter told me I was. She made observations of my behavior and I went ballistic on her. We ended up in a huge argument. She left to go be with my ex-husband. I went over there...

Bottom line, this is the lowest of the low. Ever feel that way? I called the police when I tried to get her, because I expected them to tell me to take her because I was supposed to have her this week. They told me to leave after talking to my daughter. Child Protective Services was called within the next day. In my interview with them, they told me that they would drop the case because it didn't seem like anything crazy happened. Just told me to keep my alcohol away and to seek therapy. They told me that custodial arrangements would remain. What was the lowest of the low for you?",2

Amazing. Over night. 
Though as most people know it doesnt end there. He was experiencing psychotic episodes and withdrawls to the point where he could not focus on anything. He was like a full time child. He wouldn't eat or do anything on his own. He'd just sit there and spin out into unhealthy delusion. I was scared for his life. Most days over  3 months he told me he wanted to give up and die.
I moved us out of the toxic party house and into a quiet place by the beach so he could have time and space to recover. Now I think his main problem is me. Hahaha(😭) Hes unsure of what he wants you know from life from anything. He says ""sometimes I feel so invested with you and sometimes i just dont. And when I dont I cant deal with my self."" 
Do I let him go to figure this out or would I be hurting him more by leaving. 
I understand it natural that early days in recovery means your emotions aren't fully stable. I just want to the right thing for both of us. I cant stand to see him suffer any more especially if it's my fault hes suffering.

I went on a two day bender early this week smashing a handle of Titos doing virtually zero work from home.  On Wednesday, I had my epiphany.

Day one of sobriety - horrible diarrhea and anxiety
Day two of sobriety - aweful night sweats (I ran a few miles after working at my from home desk job and took melatonin hoping it'd help)
Day three of sobriety - more intense cardio workout, healthy meals with veges and lean protein (2-3 hours of sleep at best)
Day four - jumped out of bed at 6 AM ran 3 miles and have been hydrating

For the record, my parents didn't drink basically at all while I was growing up. They didn't mention having a strong aversion to it or anything like that: they just didn't drink or keep alcohol on the house for more than cooking and very special occasions. I secretly suspect that a lack of desire stems from my dad's brother being killed by a drunk driver, but I can't absolutely confirm that. 
Also for the record, based on what I've seen in the 4 years we've been together, everyone is his family drinks. His father frequented a particular bar and grill in their town so much that he has an engraved wine glass there that the staff pitched in on for his birthday. 

Obviously, we have very different histories and experiences with drinking and that's why I'm turning to the internet for advice on how to handle the current situation. 

Husband is an amazing man. He holds a steady job, has a solid knot of amazing friends, treats my friends so incredibly well and treats me like a goddess. He is truly the best person I know and I love him so much. I'm actually tearing up a little as I write this because I'm worried he might have a real problem.

He has always loved beer. Given that he tries new ones as often as he can, I always figured this to just be some arrangement of his taste buds that made him enjoy the taste the way I like cinnamon rolls a little too much. 

The first time I saw him drink too much was after we had gotten engaged. It was a 4th of July party with his buddies and their wives and girlfriends and so on. He burned though the 12 pack he'd brought in the first 2 hours and was starting to act differently. He was louder and rowdier than ever. Not violent, let's make that clear, but maybe just a little *too* excited to be there. When I heard ""Wow, someone should probably cut [Husband] off"" from someone I didn't know and didn't know me, I was kind of validated that I should maybe pull him aside and say something. He got very defensive, accused me of calling him 'An alcoholic piece of s***' (which i absolutely didn't. Please believe that) and wouldn't hear another word from me. I definitely wasn't feeling the party mood anymore, so I cleaned up the kitchen just for something to distract myself and eventually went to bed on the guest room we were crashing in. In the middle of the night, I woke to someone we were bunking with trying to wake him up because he was sleep walk peeing in the corner of the room.
He apologized the next day for the way he spoke to me. Figuring it was just how much he drank so quickly without balancing it with food, I let it go. 
Fast forward a few months. 
We get invited on a seasonally festive,, city-wide bar crawl with this same group of friends. We start at 2 in the afternoon. As the assigned DD, I had one drink at lunch and that was it. The bars were so crowded and loud that day, that by about 6 or 7, my social battery was running low and I was feeling like I wasn't drunk enough to be enjoying myself.
An argument started within our little circle around 10, so about 3 or 4 hours past the expiration of my social battery, which I definitely don't have the means to explain simply here, but basically, feelings were hurt, mine included. Husband had been in the bathroom for this. I tried to explain why I was unhappy and was just kind of ready to go home. He just wasn't hearing me or I wasn't being as clear as I thought. He eventually accused me of hating his friends and insinuating again that I thought he was an alcoholic piece of s***.
He also threw in a comment about my family, loudly, outside on the sidewalk in front of a ton of people who all went 'Ooohhhh!'. I was done. We had offered our house as a crash pad for drunk people to sleep it off. I transferred money to those people for an Uber to my house when they were ready and then took one myself immediately. Again in the middle of the night, he had to be reminded by someone not to pee in the corner of the room.

Since this quarantine has started, we've both been stressed out so I've tried to turn a blind eye to how much he's been drinking. But last night, I was woken up by the sound of a stream of pee. I was actually ready to yell at our 6 month old puppy, but lo and behold, it wasn't the dog. I had to wake him up and tell him to take it to the bathroom and then clean the carpet at 3am.

He drinks about 3 times as much as he used to and has also started using dip. He either has a bulging lower lip and spits into a can or a fresh beer beside him every time I come into the room. He says if he's going to be trapped inside, he needs *something* to do. I'm obviously not a professional, but that struck a weird chord with me that substance use is considered a hobby in his mind. 

Our recycling bin is more beer cans and bottles than ever before in our relationship. If he isn't an alcoholic now, I worry that he's on the road to it and it scares me.

I need advice on how to approach this without attacking him or forcing him on the defensive.
I do love him and this genuinely comes from a place of care and worry for his well-being and not from a need to control him or stifle him. Granted, I would love to get the peeing in the corner thing under control, yes.

I obviously would sit down with him while he's sober, but I don't have the first clue about what I would say.",8

I have been struggling with alcoholism for years, I used to NEVER drink, but in 2013 I started working as an entertainer/stripper and was heavily encouraged to drink, so I started drinking. I essentially have been drinking in excess every day since. At first it was only while I was at work, then also socially, and eventually I started drinking ""to unwind"" alone, at home.

 In February, I started a new job and stated that I would be taking a 90 day hiatus from drinking - planning to drink to celebrate getting hired on after my temp period.

Embarrassingly, that lasted approximately 6 days. I found that I did not have the support system I needed and, unfortunately did not have the willpower to make it without consuming that particular vice.

Recent events have come about that bring to light exactly how detrimental my alcoholism is to me (and those around me). It is shitty to say I literally cried while typing this; the thought of getting my shit together shouldn't upset me.

The logical part of my brain KNOWS how bad alcohol is for my brain, body, sanity and relationships.

The addicted part of me is afraid to let go of its easiest access crutch. I don't want to stop drinking. Like a whiny and spoiled child, my brain tells me 'IT IS NOT FAIR THAT *WE* HAVE TO STOP DRINKING'.

I do not think I have a true physical dependence. When I took my break in February, I did not experience any withdrawal symptoms. However, alcohol abuse does run in my family and I have always been told to stay away from alcohol because it would likely overtake me.

I am afraid to join any local support groups due to the fact that I have enjoyed other substances on occasion: primarily psychedelics, and my understanding is that most substance use is looked down upon in those communities. I am hoping that if this is not the correct place to be open and honest while seeking help in this struggle - that someone may be able to point me in the direction of a community that I can interact with since I have decided that it is truly in my best interest to live free of alcohol.  

I refuse to allow something outside of me control me anymore, but it will be easier if I do not have the option, so I've asked my friends to be considerate and help me through this, because I am weak and need all the help I can get. I have asked that they do not invite me to bars when they reopen, and do not offer me a drink if I see them person.

Sorry if there are formatting issues, I am a mobile user.",3

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a good portion of my life starting in childhood. Realizing now that I have been using alcohol as a crutch. I am treating my depression/anxiety with therapy and medical treatment. 

My problem now lies in the guilt and embarrassment of all the things I have done while under the influence in the past. The people I’ve hurt and the blackout spells. In retrospect alcohol weighed heavily on my last relationship. After we broke up, I drank pretty heavily to numb my emotions and have just now started to process my feelings and moving on.
I feel horrible for the things I’ve said and done. How have people coped with this? I am changing my future but how do I alleviate myself of the guilt from my past?

Ive been sober for the last 5 months. When I was drinking I was polishing off 750ML of the highest proof alcohol I could find - every single day. I’d drink and cry from morning to nightfall. I’d listen to sad music that only exacerbated my poor mood. When I’d fall asleep I’d wake up with hand injuries from apparently smashing my hand into my bedpost while I slept. 


I was just in a really bad place. I’d frequently wake up in pools of my own vomit and I generally just wanted to kind of wither away and die. I became a ball of shame from going out with friends and having something like 15 drinks. I thought I convinced my friends I just had a natural high tolerance but they’d look at me with concern when I’d still be standing after all the alcohol I’d consume. I am thankfully in a better place but something strange has started happening.

So I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else, and what you have done to mitigate the negative feelings.

*my problem* 

If I smell hard liquor or beer or anything with alcohol - it takes me right back to the bad place and I’m riddled with anxiety. I heave when I gargle with listerine. 

This morning my mom was listening to a song which is actually kind of a fun dancing song - either way I was half asleep but when I heard it I started to panic and have fast heart palpitations - part of my body felt like how I’d feel in the mornings after a night of drinking to the point of blacking out. 

I can’t see people drinking in tv, I can’t see people drinking in my home even in moderation, my grandparents occasionally have wine - it takes me right back. 

If I start to feel nauseous from food that upset my stomach, my brain doesn’t relate the stomach pain to eating bad food, my brain associates it with being wildly intoxicated. Even just burping from eating something  that gave me gas catapults me back into feeling the same way I felt when I’d be drunk and burping. 

*my question*

How do you stop this? And when do you start to feel normal?

I do kind of have urges but I usually suppress them by watching tv, lighting a candle and brewing some tea. I don’t understand why I’m having this intense physical response. 

Thanks",2

We’ve been together for almost eight years, and when I met him, he was binge drinking (12-18 beers/night) every night. I initially joined him, but after a few months I realized how harmful it was and stopped. I eventually talked him into only drinking like that on weekends. He’d been going to his job as an EMT with alcohol in his breath every morning. 

He retired about six weeks ago, and now all he wants to do is drink. He’s got ED (we haven’t been intimate in four years because of it), and uncontrolled diabetes. He’s not interested in stopping or even cutting back for his health. I have a 14-year-old son who sees him drink like this. A week ago, I told him it was either me or the alcohol. He chose me. 

For the past week, things have been great. But today, he started complaining about not being able to drink. I told him I didn’t mind him drinking one or two beers in the evening, but 18 beers was too much. (I don’t know if he CAN’T stop at two, or if he just refuses to.) Now he’s saying I’m holding leaving him over his head, and that I “took it away from” him (regarding drinking). 

I literally have no idea what to do. On one hand, I don’t want his drinking to ruin our marriage, but on the other, I’m not his mommy. Plus, I’m kind of disgusted by him playing the victim card. If alcohol is so important to him, he should definitely drink. I just choose not to have that in my life. Or my son’s life.

My ex, who I have a really long-term (20+ yrs) history with, reached out last summer as his wife kicked him out and is divorcing him. As long as I have known him, he has drunk alcohol and done drugs (we had a ten year period of not talking while he was married, but he tells me he drank that whole time too). At this point in his life, however, age 40, he is drinking daily and heavily (sometimes 20 beers or so, unless he is exaggerating to sound tough or something, but I doubt it) and smoking pot (no other drugs that I'm aware of). He admits to drinking near-daily since age 14. He doesn't really try to even hide it from me or his mom (he told me he told her that he's drank daily since then too). He has a strong family history of alcoholism, so he says. There's beer cans all over his house and car, but I do think some days he drinks only a handful and other days much more. His life is falling apart from where I sit. On more sober days he is kind, gentle, sweet. On less sober days he is irritable, short, mean, depressed. I care about him deeply as a person and friend.

My questions is this:  


Are the following symptoms things you/alcoholics/those who regularly abuse alcohol experience?  


(1) night sweats  
(2) sleep apnea or stopping breathing at night   
(3) erectile dysfunction

I have a friend who is beginning their recovery. They went to their first online meeting and it sounds to me like it might not have been the right fit. 

My hope is to find a meeting/group that will be better suited for them as a person, maybe a couple options so they know that they can try again when they are ready and that if one doesn’t feel right they can keep looking.

My friend is available in the evenings after 6pm CT. The biggest concern is social anxieties. This meeting, a lot of users were on video? And many people were talking at similar times which triggered a lot of anxiety for my friend. 

I’m hoping to find a smaller meeting for them, that has a bit more structure behind who talks and when and that is very new comer friendly. The most convenient platform would be discord by far. 

Thanks so much guys! Any words of advice that I can get for myself to help them reach their goal of sobriety or for them that I can pass on would be wonderfully appreciated <3

I also know that the philosophy of AA does not work for everyone- for some reason or another. If you feel defeated or it’s just not clicking or you hate yourself even more for not being able to fit into it (like I did), there is this amazing resource I found by a badass woman named Holly Whitaker.

I live with my dad and these past weeks of quarantine I’ve been playing a lot of video games and eating a lot of junk food (just like everyone else I presume). 

But just this morning my dad busted into my room at 7AM when I was still up and still playing. He turned on all the lights and was clearly pretty angry. He was certain something was not right and asked me multiple times if I had started using again. I told hin no every time - and then he asked (angrily) if I’d be willing to take a drug test. 
I just feel so humiliated and I’m hurt that he doesn’t trust my words after all this time. I get that he could possibly be worried that I’m staying up at night eating chips and playing games. But that doesn’t mean my words shouldn’t be taken into account. 

I just feel like I’m completely on my own and if anything I’m more likely to relapse now than before that conversation because I kinda just feel abandoned. Any advice or thoughts?",3

Now I’m too the point where I’ve been drinking so much that I wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety and need another drink to fall asleep again. I’ve been closet drinking because me and my girlfriend have had arguments about the usage but I can’t stand the anxiety I feel when I’m sober. I take a shot when I first wake up to make me feel “normal”.  When I work I take a shot every three hours to make me feel “normal”. At night I drink to near blackout just to fall asleep. I don’t want to address this with my girlfriend because I already told her that I’ve cut back... but I haven’t. I’ve been trying to go as long as I can each day without drinking but I always give in because of the withdrawals. I feel them, and when I remember how bad my Xanax withdrawals were when I had to stop cold turkey cause my dealer got locked up. I had seizures for about 4 days straight and I’m terrified of withdrawals. I hate anxiety. I live a good life, I have two pets and a loving girlfriend. I bought a house 3 months ago and am paying off a mortgage to build my future, I have a stable job.

I've done some preliminary research about quitting and it seems to be that if you're a real bad alcoholic and stop suddenly you can get serious sickness. Can someone help me out with this? I have no one else to ask. How do I approach quitting? Do I do it slowly or cold turkey? If I go the cold turkey route is there any way to tell if I will get sick by taking into account how much I currently drink?

Thought I was good enough to handle it. I was wrong. Soon slipped back into my old ways of daily drinking or drinking every other day which makes my life a misery, literally.

However, on the 3rd March I tried again (due to the severe anxiety/pains I was getting. And with the help of the corona virus pandemic which I can’t lie has helped me stay out of the pub has made this a lot easier. I don’t know whether or not I would of made it this far without it.

However, I’ve always had in my head if I can go 90 days it will be a long enough time for me to shake off the bulk of addiction and a long enough time to untangle the addiction of having an alcoholic lifestyle.

I fucking hate alcohol, I resent it more now than ever and the longer sober I go the more I hate it. The last few days I have been having these DEEP thoughts of the bad times it’s caused, the stupid things I did or said, the dangerous situations I got myself in. And FUCK it scares the life out of me. I’m not saying I won’t ever drink alcohol again - I probably will. But the longer I go without it the more I hate it and want to keep it out of my life.

One day at a time I guess.

P.S - if you’re drinking alcohol right now and it causes your problems then stop. Poor your drink away eugh now in the sink. Prepare yourself for a tough few days, plan how your going to make it as easy as possible to cope with over the next week or two and beat the shit out of it. If you don’t stop now you will in 1,5,10,20 years from now or when your dead. But the sooner the better so you can live your life again, work on your goals and dreams and live your best life. Alcohol is invisible handcuffs around your arms and a ticking time bomb in your head.",84

A bit of background (feel free to skip) this is my understanding of the situation 
I am a 20 and my dad is an alcoholic. It probably started when I was about 14 due to work related stress. He lost said job when I was 18 and was on/ off benders for about 4 months until he got a job. He was ok for about a month then got into a car accident while drunk. Lost his job, went to jail for a bit but was able to do a home arrest while working program (with a different job). He just finished the program last Friday (it was a nine month program) and his alcohol detecting ankle monitor was taken off. The same day he started drinking again. He left Sunday afternoon and no one in my family knows where he is.

Now the question, should my family (especially my mom) cut him off? (By cut off I mean not let him back into the house, not answer his calls, even my mom getting a legal separation to protect herself) Does cutting people off actually work? We still love him and want to help him, but nothing we try seems to get through to him.

My dad is very manipulative and will no doubt come back to my mom at some point. He will not stop drinking when he gets back. However now that my mom, my sister, and I are working from home having him in the house would make work almost impossible. Plus I have no idea where he has been and could have possibly contacted the coronavirus and give it to us. (I am diabetic and my mom has a heart condition so this is very serious to us). 

This is not what we want at all but at this point he has broken our trust and hurt all of us. I don’t want him to die on the streets but he is unresponsive to help and we just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Thanks in advanced for any advice. Like I said all perspectives are welcome.",3

How bad is my detox going to be?,"I have been drinking since my 21st bday. I turned 33 a little less than a month ago. I have slowly but steadily increased my consumption over this time. Used to be I would drink a 6 pack on friday or saturday night with friends but that turned into buying beer to keep in the fridge at all times, I even have a kegorator now.

Currently I drink light beer, but I drink the 16 oz cans. I drink anywhere from 5 to 12 of these a night. With so much liquid (volume) going in I tend to urinate a lot. Since I drink beer and not hard liquor, I want to tell myself that I don't get as drunk... i start when I get home M-F around 5-6:30 and I drink until I go to sleep which is 11-1am usually. On weekends I start around 3-5 and stay up that late. I am an avid video game player and I think this is my psychological tie in. I used to smoke a lot of weed while playing games but now it's beer. 

I don't drink hard liquor at all. Maybe 2-3 times a year when a family member gives me a shot at a birthday party or while playing a round of golf I will do a shot at the turn.

With all of that being said, I hate the way I look in the mirror, I have gained 30 pounds in the past 4 years (50% is in my face it feels like)

I wanted to get some advice from someone that has been in a similar situation as me. Not a vodka/whisky/rum drinker (no offense) but someone that drinks between 64 - 192 oz of beer a night, every night for a period of lets say at least 3+ years...

Is a medical detox necessary since I only drink beer? What are your symptoms during detox like? Is this something I can do during the week or do I need to take off of work?

I am looking forward to getting my life back and being able to save $250 a month by not spending it on beer. Thanks in advance for any advice.",2

I’ll spend the first few hours of my shift dragging along or my entire shift if I decide not to drink but the relief of the I don’t want to do this or lack of motivation whatever that feeling is that keeps you from doing what you know you should be doing goes away with just a little liquor. The reason I started drinking at work is a result of the feeling not a consequence of it. I dragged ass at work months and months and months before I realized that liquor would soothe the anxiety and just let me do what I need to do and be proud of it.,2

For a few years my sister (23) has suspected that my mom (62) might have developed a drinking problem. Until about a year ago I (23) didn’t necessarily think she was right, but then began to notice some worrisome behavior. Before I go into the details about what’s happened, I think it’s also important to note my mom has a memory impairment- it's probably early onset Alzheimer’s that hasn’t been diagnosed, but from an MRI looks very likely. 

About a year ago I would notice sometimes we talked on the phone in the early or late evening she would be slurring her words, and she would be a little more forgetful than normal. I don’t live in the same state and try to see her every few months, but because of this I couldn’t really observe her behavior. 

Last June I visited her to take her to see a neurologist, and I ended up taking her to the emergency room. She had gone on a date, got drunk and wandered out of the restaurant before dinner had been served, and a group of very sweet teenagers called me from her phone, saying she had fallen and hit her head on the sidewalk. Once things calmed down I called her date to try to figure out what happened, and he said she had about 6 glasses of wine and then disappeared. When I picked her up she had claimed to only have 2 glasses, but was very inebriated. At that time I was concerned, but thought with her memory condition she had forgotten how many glasses she had. 

About a month ago I got a call from her around 11:30 am on a Saturday- she was slurring her words and not making much sense- she kept calling me her dog’s name. I called her boyfriend, who she’s been dating for about 9 months, to see if he could go check on her. It turns out she hadn’t eaten enough and had likely also mixed up medications on top of drinking. He took her out to eat, and again she wandered out of the restaurant. This time he had to call the police to find her. 

With the coronavirus he has been living with her, and today he realized she was sneaking around and had likely been drinking vodka and wine without him knowing and fell and hurt her wrist. When he suggested that maybe they shouldn’t keep alcohol in the house she got mad and told him to leave. She did forget that she said that so he is still with her, but I am concerned because this is such a huge burden for him. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? I am in the middle of moving and we are also in the middle of a pandemic so I don’t know if I should go down to visit or not, and even if I go I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions would be wonderful.",11

Alcohol may cause khirrosis, makes you fatter, increases blood pressure, etc but i dont understand the stigma behind it. When people find out i drink, they look me in the eyes like im a murderer. Now you may say ""some people dont judge"" but my experience says otherwise.

It has gotten so bad that, during discussions, ppl will reject my opinion simply cause i drink. Crazy, isnt it? I know its wrong, i know its bad for my body, i know i shouldnt be doing that shit but.. i just like it dude. It increases dopamine levels on my head, and im honestly ok with it. Im aware of the risk and i choose to take it, for now at least. This doesnt mean im stupid or ignorant. Do people feel the need to feel superior so badly? Or maybe my friends are secretly bullies and i hadnt realized it?

i just dont understand. Its none of their fucking buiseness, so why do they even bother?",0

Or should you just stay quiet and pretend everything is fine, so they never know there's an issue? Especially considering they might not remember having done anything.

In my case, I was never confronted, and found out how people felt through another source. As a result, gossip and false rumors spread, and some friends cut me off without even talking to me. If I had been confronted about it, I would have taken responsibility and cut down on drinking sooner. But now, it just feels like I had a bunch of fake friends who were too afraid of confrontation to say anything...

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It just would have been nice for people to be straight with me, yknow? Because now that I'm aware of it, I am going to work on this. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",2

My boyfriend of 2 months identifies as a recovered alcoholic, as in he doesn’t need recovery, because he is fully in control. He did identify himself as an alcoholic who used to spend days at a time drunk and could get aggressive back when he was in the military. He says he realized he hated how he felt and how he was living and decided to never get to that place again and since then he has control. 

He says he’s always had a high tolerance (he started drinking when he was 12) and so now he doesn’t drink to get drunk, but he drinks to relax like when he’s socially anxious or just for the taste. He says he needs about 6 drinks to start feeling it. So he does drink more than the average 25 year old maybe but it barely effects him. 

He feels incredibly invalidated if I don’t use the word ‘recovered’ to refer to him. He got really explosive the first time I told him that I was very open to accepting that was his reality and that he did feel in control, and that my prior understanding of that feeling of control was called recovery which is experienced in many ways. 

I know there’s a lot of different ways of experiencing alcoholism and I’ve heard that there are some people in AA for example who leave and say they are recovered. 

My question is, is Recovered a thing? How can I best validate him in his experience? Or is it objectively invalid as some of my alcoholic friends would say? Very open to any and all answers.",1

I’m a 20 year old female who is headed to detox in 2 days. I’ve been reading and watching hellish stories of people’s withdrawal symptoms while going through detox. But all these people said they were putting away a bottle of vodka a day. I don’t drink nearly that much but I do put away about 2 bottles of wine a night (750 ml). I am absolutely horrified I will have a seizure while withdrawing. I’m not prone to seizures and I’ve never had one in my life but my hands are shaking and I’m twitching bad in the morning before I have my drinks. I can handle the other symptoms but I’m so scared I’m going to have a seizure and go into a coma.
I am also scared of the DTs as well but those don’t cause coma or death.
My question is given what you know about how much I drink, do you think detox will be less severe for me? Do you think I’ll have a seizure? I’m not seeking medical advice again, I just want opinions from people who have gone through detox and how many drinks they were having before checking in. (You DONT have to tell if you don’t want).

Like most people I know what alcohol is like. I had binges in my highschool (even blackouts), also a lot of binges during my university program, I also had 1.5 years without alcohol (it was when I got my drivers license, I liked driving so much that I refused to drink even at my birthday so I would be able to drive at any time).

Nowdays (after I got my first job) I stopped drinking in the weekdays completely (beacuse it gave me a nasty feeling in the morning and I couldn't concentrate) and only drank about 2-3 beers with my friends every saturday when we usually hang out. Currently (with the coronavirus) I don't drink at all because it's no fun doing that all by yourself :) and I always find that alcohol lowers A LOT my mental performance levels and this does bother me. 

The reason I am addicted to nicotine is the exact opposite of why I'm not finding addiction in alcohol - I feel like nicotine boosts my ability to concentrate and reason and it helps me understand things easier (that is besides those withdrawal symptoms which you have to constantly kill with a cigarette).


So bottom line question:

I know what nicotine withdrawal is like (painful and you definitely feel it) but I never experienced alcohol withdrawal (or maybe I've experienced it and I didn't notice). 

Why is alcohol considered to be such an addictive drug with strong withdrawal symptomps (even compared with opiates withdrawal symptoms) ?",5

Though when I want to, I can go dry for long periods... weeks or months. I went mostly dry my last two years of college to boost my grades and get into the department I wanted, as an example.

Up to this point, my drinking was just weekend partying. It helped me socialize and get me out of my quiet shell. It seemed to help me be less awkward around women.

During my first marriage, I began having a couple of beers when I got home from a stressful job as a software dev at a tech company near Seattle. After a while, I was having 3 beers a night. Strong beers -- IPAs.

That marriage ended because she wanted kids and I didn't and then I remarried hoping this time to a wife that would not nag me to have kids. No dice. She also decided she wanted kids two years into our marriage. We divorced. I've been single ever since, girl friends here and there but nothing more serious.

Until recently, I've always just thought my drinking was something over which I had control. If I wanted to, I could take a month or two off, and I often did.

But the last couple of years it has gotten worse.

I drink more often now when I'm alone. 

My kid sister died two years ago while I was out of the country and I've had a hard time forgiving myself for not rushing home when her father put her in hospice. I gambled that she would hang on until my scheduled flight... but I lost that bet and never got to say a last goodbye.

Drinking helps dull that pain a little. But then I wake up feeling like shit... often at 3am craving alka seltzer... and then having some kind of grey depression all the following day.

I've upgraded from IPA to tequilla. Problem is that it goes down very easy... and after one tumbler... my willpower to stop at one glass is gone and then I'll have a 2nd glass, then a 3rd.

Next day I'll see that I drank a 3rd of a bottle and then I'll skip drinking for a few days... but I'm worried I might drink myself into a coma. This national stay at home order isn't helping. I'm alone here.",10

I want to tell her that if she wants to drink her life away and be dead by 60, that’s up to her but I’m done caring because I literally cannot go through all of this again. I have a lot more worse things to say but I’m keeping it brief on here. Any advice on what to do? Do I call her out in person?

She’s definitely on a lot of prescription medication that shouldnt be mixed with alcohol. She has had several life threatening situations as a result. I have talked it out with her countless times. She has gone to rehab, alcohol classes, and AA meetings. Shes lied about quitting countless times. 

Visited her alone today to talk it out (she doesnt really have close friends or local family) she told me she gives up on trying anymore because of X reasons. And she will buy more alcohol if i throw out what she has. She was also drunk - shes always drunk when i come over.

I cant let her drink herself to death. I dont want her to continue harassing my Father and I (through nasty phone calls and texts).

Hello, friends.

I'm 47 years old, been drinking since about 21. Highly functional alcoholic. Gainfully employed, no DUI, etc.

Mostly  beer, though lately vodka and whiskey. I don't drink all day - but  immediately after work until bedtime. Sometimes all day on the weekends.

I'd say I average 6-12 beers every night. Been this way for about 20 years.

I  need help tapering to avoid withdrawal and keep my life together. I'm  working from home during this pandemic, and have to have my mental  facilities in good shape.

I just  started taking Naltrexone 4 days ago, based on my friend's  recommendation. He's very much like me, only 10 years younger. It seems  to help me drink less, except last night when I got blackout drunk on  whiskey. Woke up today with mad hangxiety...

To  my point:

I need to taper down with as few side effects as possible. I  am on my first beer of the evening. I intend to stop at 3 or 4. I will  likely do this for a few days, then decrease by 1, and continue until I  can have  only 1 drink per night to keep the withdrawal away.

Please give me any advice. I'm scared and I want to get better. I cannot go to treatment, and am doing this myself.

I also appreciate any success stories from those who have done something similar.

TL;DR:  
Please help me taper as painlessly as possible and give me success stories!",10

I posted here some time ago. I'm on my 17th day today without a single drop. I was drinking the past 10 years on and off. No high percentage stuff ever but 4-6-8 beers a day. 

Last year I got myself checked (liver ct, blood levels etc.) and everything was fine again. This I now know made me confident again I could have a beer or two in a week. 

Learn from me: Alcohol is a parasite in your brain and it will do EVERYTHING it can to convince you that you can drink one or two a week. But it sent me back to 6 months of drinking daily again. 

So now here I am 17 days sober again. I apparantly either was not physically addicted or I was merely abusing alcohol to the maximum because I never had any DT's at all - nor did I have physical symptoms of withdrawal. I could, always stop if I got my mindset on it. And that after 10 years! 

So I'm fine. I wont be falling for the ""you can do one or two"" trap again. Maybe it was even good for me to relapse. Because I now learned about myself that ONE is enough and that I'm trying to fool myself here. Rather that parasite is.

What actually is worrying me the most at the moment is that i might have done damage from ALL GOOD AGAIN to extremely fucked up within these 6 months. 

I am scared because I need to get my blood values checked again next week. No pain, no issues - no bilirubin in urine, no leuco's no protein. But damn I know that after 6 months and merely 21 days by then my y-gt will be very high. This doesn't go normal in a few weeks.

I learned - and I got it under control again. And wont go back again. But what the hell do I tell the DOC. Accepting the shame before others is my gravest fear by far. This is not an option and most propably the only thing that could possibly send me back again. He will most likely want to send me to some therapy but I now know I can do it without. I'd rather keep my job.

Also, will this red tone on my hands go away ever again? I'm told I look normal and I'm exaggerating but I somehow know I look different than other people.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading this. You are worth far more than you know - simply by reading you are helping. I can throw my thoughts out here and only brothers and sisters in arms will judge me. 

Stay safe and stay clean in this hard times.",6

It wasn’t until I was 21 and could buy my own that I would drink more frequently. I would say the last 2 year’s I drink about 3-5 days a week, most of them alone, unless it’s a wine night or a dinner party or going out. When I’m alone I like to drink and then I’ll over drink because it’s like I’m chasing this feeling that I can’t seem to ever get, and that’s why I keep drinking, because I think it’s reachable. What usually happens is I’ll drink 6 to 8 beers, depending, and then wake up dehydrated, but not hungover. Sometimes I’ll force myself to stay awake to drink more to feel “good”.

I'm posting here so I don't forget how much better this feels. I hope this helps some of you tough it out too. :),"No panic attacks.  Very, very little anxiety.  Remember...  I used to have 50+ a day EVERY DAY for years.  When I'm sober I have three or fewer per *month.*  

I've gotten so much done today!  Since I'm stuck at home I'm doing some inexpensive decorating of my apartment.  When I broke up with my ex fiance I got some things from the dollar tree to decorate my new place.  I was working the longest hours I ever had and didn't have time to make the place my own, though.  Yesterday and today I've put those peel-off wall stickers on some walls, hung up my pictures, added lighting, planted a hibiscus, succulents, and sowed some seeds to repot in a few weeks.  It's even cleaner than it was in here!  I've always been artistic and great with interior decorating but alcohol-induced apathy and depression made me not care much about it.  Now it looks so good that it's a shame we have to stay away from people.  I'd love to show it off!

I went to the dollar tree earlier for some AA batteries for my string lights (they're little green leaves!).  I drove past the grocery store where they have my favorite non-liquor drinks on sale.  I ALMOST went in.  But I reminded myself of how that last binge (which really wasn't bad at all compared to how I used to drink daily...) sucked.  And not only the recovery...  But how when I drink now, and for the last few years, it hasn't been fun.  I just go into autopilot.  The lights are on but no-one's home.  I just feel hollow and depressed the whole time and each time I drink those feelings intensify.  It's such an empty feeling.  It's the exact opposite of fulfillment in every way.  A waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of a previously good feeling, a waste of the confidence and self-esteem I'm slowly gaining.

I hope you're all having a great day!  I'm here if anyone needs to chat.  Stay strong.  If you screw up realize that you did, but don't focus on that.  Focus on your goal and making a plan for acting differently next time.  That's what's finally been helping me out.  :) <3",10
2020-04-15 13:42:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/g1wrsh/almost_three_months_sober_temptation_hasnt_been_a/,Almost three months sober temptation hasn’t been a thing until recently,"This whole stay at home thing would have been the perfect excuse for me to say fuck it and pick up a bottle a few months ago. To add more fire to that excuse is I’ve been doing okay financially while others aren’t... then a stimulus check comes and first thought in my head was “why not get a bottle? I can afford it”

It’s all just bullshit. Stay at home or not I will come up with another idea why drinking might be the answer. Money or not that doesn’t matter because even on days when I had no money I still always managed to get booze (legally). It’s insane how addiction works with thoughts of justifying everything as an excuse to give in. If I had a bad day, drink. If I had a good day, celebrate with a drink. 

Why I’m staying sober today:

I remember the multiple long withdrawals I had every time I stopped drinking. How I was so sick I believed I was going to die.

I remember how I let shit get so bad I didn’t care that I hit rock bottom and basically lost everything. Shit happens but the fact that I didn’t care at all is scary. I more or less had no will to live. 

I think about what I do have left now and what I’m slowly gaining back and how i never want to let go of ever again. 

I gave everything I could mentally and physically to finally get sober and push through so much that the fact it could all be ruined by a simple sip of booze is sickening. It’s too easy to give in but it’s amazing to not. I feel so strong everyday that I don’t drink and didn’t choose the easy way out. 

Clarity, I can actually think now and see things clearly which feels amazing. 

Now, I may wake up tomorrow with another bullshit thought about drinking. I will think how drinking is an option but I will choose not to. At the end of the day it’s my choice and no one else’s... addiction is not going to make up the choice for me either. I know what I want and won’t give in. Have a good day everyone.",6

Tried studying 4 times dropped out after a few years of university each time due to drinking. I can’t carry on like that. This is my last shot and I have to say this quarantine has finally managed to open my eyes to why is that.

It’s not anything mental illness related, apart from my rampant alcoholism. I may be depressed, I may be borderline, but I do fine until I decide to get drunk. Then after day’s of drinking and vomiting I get to the point where I am now. Sick, with a pounding headache and moral hangover larger than my bloody country.

But that’s enough. I don’t know how but I will quit. I have all the drugs. From naltrexone that makes drink not fun to others that should help me with my mental problems instead of running into a yet another bottle. This is like a curse. And now I decided to finally fight it. All those therapies and all those rehabs. But this time I quit for real.

I lost enough opportunities. From being the bright kid in our liceum or something like a high school geared towards making us ready for university, through my first second and third tries at university. My first real relationship. I lost so much but I always blamed the combo, and never pinpointed the blame at the bottle, where it truly lied.

So there it is. I put it here as much for you as I do for me to hold myself accountable. I found the reason for my failings and now it’s up to me to overcome. AA with their religion failed. Therapists with their “understand where it’s from” failed (at least I know why, but I still do it). So I guess a hard ass approach of enough is enough is my final shot at normality.",1

1)	We do not drink, no matter what.   This too shall pass.  The person, place, thing, event, or feeling which makes us desire a drink will usually be gone in a short period of time.   Drinking, and the consequences of drinking, will be there much longer, perhaps forever.

2)	Find 3 meetings a day where you feel comfortable, so that you have a place to go if you have the desire to drink, and so that you have a place to go when you want to avoid a particular person in the program.

3)	Do not call your sponsor at 2AM with a problem that you had at 10PM

4)	Every person in the program knows what day one is like, regardless of how far away they are from their own personal day one.  We have all been there, we all understand what the process of getting sober is like.

5)	Wisdom is the ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again.

6)	Progress is stopping that mistake earlier in the process

7)	Doing or saying something harmful to another person and then apologizing is not the same as not doing or saying it in the first place.    See  # 6!

8)	We work the steps in order.  Parts of step 9 can be done prior to completing step 8, but only after consulting a sponsor, since the second part of step 9 emphasizes that we do not take actions which could injure them or others.

9)	When sharing at a meeting, we tell our story in the form of how it was, what happened, and what it is like now.  We speak using “I”, “me,” and sometimes “we.”  We use the progress in our lives to attract others to this way of life.  When we speak using  “I”, we internalize the event or feeling into our story.  As long as we are telling our story, we can never be wrong.  I cannot tell another what to do in a share.  I can only say what I did, and what the results were, good or bad.  It is then their decision to try what I did, or perhaps what another did.

10)	The word “you” shall never be spoken when sharing at a meeting.   “You” is NOT part of “our” story.   When we use “you” in a share, we are promoting the program, which is a violation of the 11th tradition.  When we share using “you,”  we separate ourselves from the event or feeling.  Nearly everyone coming into AA has a big problem with trust.  All of our lives we have heard you, you, you, and therefore we close off our eyes, ears, and minds when the word “you” is spoken.  We take on a defensive stance.  But when a person shares in the form of “I did, I thought, I felt,” we listen because they are talking about themselves and not us.   Basically, the word “you” in a share helps no one.

11)	If we employ the 12 traditions in our personal conduct in other affairs, we will always be at peace with our decisions.

12)	Here are the odds.   One in five people who need this program ever make it to their first meeting.  Of those, one in five make it to one year.  When a person leaves AA, their chance of getting back are one in five.   So for every person who shares at a meeting that they have left and come back, there are four people who left and never made it back.  The odds of coming back are not good, therefore it is best to not leave in the first place.    See  # 1!

13)	AA is for those who want it.  This program cannot be sold.  The only way a person gets sober is by being attracted to the changes they see in another.  The only way we can help a friend or family member is to get ourselves sober first.

14)	A person who is actively drinking is ten times more likely to get us drunk than we are to get them sober.   We never make a 12 step contact by ourselves.  Alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful.

15)	Go to meetings until you hear someone tell “your” story.  If you never hear your story, at least you have been to a lot of meetings.

16)	In the beginning, all we have is “our story.”  At the end, all we have is “our story.”  With work, the “what it is like now” part will be much better.

17)	We cannot give away what we don’t have.  We cannot keep that which we don’t give away.

18)	The Serenity Prayer can be shortened to “is it me or is it them?”   If its me, I work on it.  If its them, I let it go.  See #5.

19)	You can’t bullshit a bullshitter.  Don’t even try.  Its insulting.   ;-)

20)	Never make a major decision before consulting another member of the program.  If they think it is a good idea, then it probably is.  In the process of explaining my idea to another person, I often discover problems or issues I hadn’t considered when I first came up with it.",10

I was drinking 750ML of rum pretty much every day. I didn’t go to therapy or AA because I was too ashamed. But I had support from all of my friends. After some time it dawned on me that I was also babying myself in a lot of ways. Wore big sweaters. Applied Vick’s vapo rub to my temples. Watched soothing movies. Slept 13 hours. The whole nine yards. After even more time, during a rare moment of sobriety I booked a trip to England (I live in California) and I just fucking left with no return date. Everything immediately became about surviving in England. For me personally it became super easy to not want to drink because my thoughts were elsewhere. 


Im home now and I still have urges to drink especially in this lockdown due to COVID 19 but I’ve developed a routine for myself that I stick to every day and it’s been helpful in keeping me sober. I’ve resigned myself to the fact that a relapse is likely, but I have the tools to get through a relapse. I think I had such a hard time back then because I didn’t accept my internal sadness, I spent months pushing it away.

My mom has always been what you'd call a high-functioning alcoholic, and she has a nasty streak when she's drunk sometimes. Not toward random strangers, but specifically toward me. (I don't know if she's ever had a nasty streak toward other people in her life, but I have personally never observed it being toward anyone but me.) When I was in middle and high school, she would get drunk and intentionally pick fights with me. For example, for no reason at all, she would start talking bad about me, so that I would hear, to my dad. I fought really hard to not react but I was a kid and I've always been very sure of myself with very strong ideas of right and wrong, so I would usually get dragged into a fight over something stupid. She would call me names and insult me; she once told me I was ""worse than Hitler"" because I disagreed with her on politics (which I tried not to talk about, but she kept pushing and bringing it up). 

As I got older, I could talk to my dad about it and we both started to acknowledge at the end of high school/first year of college that she is a high-functioning alcoholic. Probably 4-5/7 days a week she drinks a bottle and a half at least of wine. She goes on periods where she'll cut back on the drinking for a while, but she always go back to the same habits. 

It's extremely hard for me. I am completely dry and have no intention of drinking, and being around my mom when she's drunk immediately makes me irritated and in a fight-or-flight mindset. I'm very on edge, I can't stand to look her in the eye, and everything she says in that slurred voice sets me even more on edge. Whenever she's drunk around me, I stay super quiet and excuse myself as quickly as possible. 

Being back home from college for quarantine has brought all of that back to the surface. A couple of months ago, I talked to her about her drinking and how being around her when she drank stressed me out (using ""I feel..."" statements, not accusatory) and she seemed very receptive. She said she was so sad to hear that it bothered me and she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable like that around her. She then asked me to tell her when she was drinking too much, which, at the time, I didn't know how to respond to, so didn't contest. (I feel this unfairly puts the responsibility on me to control her drinking habit, especially because I do not like interacting with her when she is drunk, and risk getting screamed at and insulted.)

She did get better for a while and always made a point of saying to me ""Hey, I only had one glass tonight"" etc. However, since she is now bored at home all the time because of quarantine, she has started drinking profusely again. She finished a bottle and a half by herself within a couple hours' time frame and was so drunk that she fell on her way to her bedroom and injured her side (caught her side on a table corner, just a scrape, no breaks or anything, but that shit hurts and she was in pain). As horrible as it sounds, I was having such a hard time feeling compassionate because a big part of me was like, ""Well, you shouldn't have been this damn drunk in the first place."" I had been avoiding her all night and tending to her by getting her an ice pack, Tylenol, helping her get up, etc. just got on my nerves, which makes me feel guilty. I feel for her because she hurts and I don't want her to hurt, but I also feel resentful about it, because almost every night now I just have to lock myself in my room playing video games so as not to feel extremely anxious and on edge.

I love her very much when she is sober, but I'm just so frustrated with her drunk self. I think she doesn't want to be drinking this much, but she also doesn't want to give up alcohol, just ""cut back."" I personally do not think that it's possible for her to just cut back when past evidence clearly shows she always returns to her old habits, but I'm not sure how to express this to her without coming across as arrogant or without sounding like I'm telling her what to do (because I don't think she would take this well unless she specifically asked me for advice). She responds a lot more to me when I talk to her about this than when my dad talks to her, but I just don't know how to get through to her that she needs to stop drinking entirely, or very, very strictly limit herself to 1-2 glasses a night at the very least. 

I guess I'm looking for advice? Comfort? To rant? I'm just frustrated and this seemed like a good community to talk about it and potentially get understanding and helpful tips on how to deal with it.",3

The last couple days weren’t bad but today I just keep thinking about all the bad decisions I’ve ever made like everything keeps replaying in my head even stuff from high school and childhood which I don’t care about now. I just keep thinking how everyone hates me and it’s just eating me up inside. I have this non stop stress and anxiety that I would normally drink to not feel. My mind is non stop racing and I feel super panicky. I went to one AA meeting last year and I had the worst panic attack ever. I tried to speak when it was my turn but my voice started shaking and I literally left crying. So embarrassing. So I just went back to drinking hopefully reading stuff here helps since it’s not in person. I deleted all my social media today too since I was making an even bigger fool out of myself on there. Also my husband drinks everyday and refuses to quit with me which is probably going to make this even harder.",3

First time posting here. I’ve never actually had anyone in my life affected by alcoholism, save for my grandfather (but that was before I was born). 

In October 2019 I reconnected with a good friend of mine I hadn’t seen since around 2012. We had been friends all throughout middle school, but drifted apart in 2012. We are both 25 for context.

It was not under good circumstances; she had sent me a message asking to come to her fathers funeral (RIP). Like I said, not good circumstances to reconnect under, but we spent the whole day together and have been spending time together quite often again, it’s been really nice having her in my life again. One of those friends that you just click with. It had been 8 years since I saw her and felt like no time had passed when I did finally see her, if that makes sense. 

So, since reconnecting with her I’ve realized she’s had an issue with drinking for a few years. She’s told me about it, and is somewhat open about it. I think she knows it’s a problem, but I’m not so sure. I didn’t think much of it at first; we would hangout after work and she would want to grab a bottle of wine for example. Then I realized every-time we hung out she would buy 4 bottles of wine and tell me she had to sneak them inside (she’s living with her mom right now). I thought at first maybe she buys a few at a time so she doesn’t have to stop at the store for the week, but we hung out a few days in a row and it was the same thing. 

Every time we hangout she’s drinking, she’ll bring a bottle of wine and a few other drinks with her in her purse. I started to notice it more the more we hung out; she wouldn’t remember hanging out with me or anything we did, conversations we had. For example, we would talk about an old inside joke of ours and the next day I would message her about it and she would be confused why I brought it up. 

Most recently I took her over to a friend of mines house, because she doesn’t have a ton of positive influence in her life and talks about how she doesn’t have many friends so I thought I’d introduce her to my other friends. We weren’t there for an hour and she was so drunk she was slurring all her words, fell over on the floor. I couldn’t understand her at all, so I got her up took her to my car and took her home and inside to make sure she was okay. The next day she messaged me and asked me if she fell cause she had a bruise, and I took the opportunity to lightly ask her if anything else was wrong, and tell her I don’t think I’ve seen her drink that much before, told her if anything else was going on she could talk to me and I wasn’t judging her for drinking. 

She basically just told me that it happens sometimes and she used to drink like that all the time, and just said something like “well that’s alcohol for ya hahaha”.

I’m at the point now that I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to confront her or make her feel like she can’t be open or talk with me; if she feels like she has to hide things from me that will only be worse. But I’ve never been in this situation before, I want to tell her I’m concerned about her, I’ve never seen her eat dinner when we hangout she’ll come over and I’ll cook supper and she won’t eat anything just drink her wine. I’m scared for her health, I’m scared she won’t be able to hold a job or get out of debt, and honestly I just kind of want my friend back. It’s hard to hangout with her and have to repeat myself multiple times because she can’t remember what I’ve said, I’m sure some of you know what I mean.

I don’t mean to come off as ignorant, I just have zero experience with this and I’m hoping someone here may be able to give me some tips, perhaps the best thing I can do is do nothing but I’m just not sure. Thanks in advance.",4

&#x200B;

Last week, my girlfriend told me she was worried about my alcohol use. In the last 3-4 months, I've had a rough time, college decided to kick me out despite proving good grades like they asked last semester, ended up losing my student job and my laptop was accidentally destroyed, which contained a lifetime project. I slowly fell in a pattern of drinking maybe 4-6 days a week to help me calm down my anxiety and sleep easier. Of course, as I felt better in the last weeks, I didn't lose this bad habit as I was used to it.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend confronted me about this and I immediately told her I'd stop from now on. So for the last 7 days, I stopped drinking, and suffered through a mild withdrawal, feeling better every day. However, to help me cope with the withdrawal, I chose to chat and game with friends. They all are drinking most nights due to the quarantine, and it's slowly making me crave beer more and more every night. The thing is I use these games and chats to think about anything else than alcohol. I don't want to tell my friends, because I fear they will change how they act around me and how they see me.

&#x200B;

So now for my question : More and more I feel like I'm growing more anxious to be exposed to the envy of having a beer, and I'd like to try to drink more casually, but this worries my girlfriend, who fears I might relapse. I don't want to isolate from my friends, since it's the only thing that helps me power through this, but I feel like I just quit drinking coffee, and every day I'm being shoved coffees in my face more and more and it's increasingly difficult. I intend to eventually drink beer casually like I used to and I think I have the willpower, but I thought quarantine was going to be helping me quit alcohol for a while, like a month, and I'm concerned with the fact that my main solution of gaming and chatting is exposing me a lot more to drinking than my social activities. before the quarantine.

&#x200B;

Am I crazy to think I should tamper gradually with my withdrawal? I quit alcohol because I couldn't quit on my own bad habits and my girlfriend noticed me of it, so I fear my judgement might be clouded, I'd appreciate some insight.

I've cut back sure, two handles turned into two bottles, i drink more with friends around or when im frustrated. But I find also drink more (beer that is) when I work on my car or study. Beer for when I need motor function but whiskey for when i don't. I just want it to stop.. I want to quit and I've tried and tried... Cold turkey, tappering off..

2020-04-12 18:59:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/g06r2m/librium_seroquel_and_gabapentin_to_withdraw/,"Librium, seroquel, and gabapentin to withdraw","I recently had a bender for about a week. Started slow and progressed to killing half a handle and 6-12 beers a day. Decided I was done after my taper with beer didn’t work. I called my psychiatrist who prescribes me klonopin (I have anxiety and use 1mg as needed). 
Well, he put me on Librium to ward off seizures. Gabapentin for anxiety. Seroquel for sleep. 

The Librium didn’t help my withdraw the first night. I still felt like I would seize any moment. No outward shakes but inward, if that makes sense. Anxiety was awful and I couldn’t sleep. Decided to take another because my first dose was only one and it says one-two per dose. Finally I fell asleep around 3am after taking them at 9:30 and 10:30. I woke up, took another Librium and started the gabapentin at a small dose. That night I took half a seroquel and it knocked me out. I woke up talking to my husband about how I needed to put a package into the mailbox, and some other weird shit. I was slurring my words and it made my husband worried. I woke up groggy. Had thoughts like “I just want to die” and I was easy to snap on my husband. I then slept all day long. 
I’ve withdrawn from alcohol before with klonopin. I would have this time without telling my doc but I was 5 days shy of my next script. 

Just to be clear- this virus has had me in a panic. We have a 6 week old newborn. I worry about her and I can’t stand that we can’t leave the house. I stopped taking my klonopin when I was drinking but I did take it in the mornings in a higher dose when I started to get “the fear”. 

I fucked up. I binged again. I don’t want it to happen again and I honestly believe it won’t after this hellacious experience. All of these medications combined as left me as a shell of a person. I have no joy, no sadness. I’m just sitting here staring out the window. 

My psychiatrist didn’t call me back today due to it being a holiday. I can’t see him on FaceTime until tomorrow afternoon. 

What do I do? Do I stop the meds all together and drink small amounts? I can’t take the gaba or seroquel anymore, I refuse. But I don’t know much about Librium. Can I take it as directed and drink a beer or two? My doctor said to avoid alcohol or it will be a “Whitney Houston”. I’ve mixed Benzos and alcohol before, which I’m not
proud of. But will this help me until he HOPEFULLY prescribes me klonopin again? 

I fucked up. I need someone to explain all of these medications and tell me everything’s going to be okay. 

Btw my husband has been very good about taking care of my daughter during this. He doesn’t drink and is the best husband and father there is. He supports me and takes care of me but there is only so much he can do. I feel awful so please don’t make me feel worse. 

Also- I know you guys aren’t doctors. I just need advice about these meds and alcohol.

EDIT- I don’t abuse my klonopin when I take it for anxiety. It actually helped me stop drinking in the past, and I hate to blame this on the virus but COVID has me really on edge and I started drinking again.",3

Additionally, when I have been able to not drink for an 'extended period' of time, there is minimal recognition from her part (not that she owes me that), so I fall right back into drinking to control my stress and anxiety, but, I need to take responsibility for my situation and not throw blame on her.  Through the years, I began to lean on liquor to calm my nerves, but I don't want to do that anymore.  I completely understand that wanting to be the best dad cannot live in tandem with excessive drinking, but I still cannot stop.  It breaks my heart when my kids ask for their mama, but she is emotionally unavailable, and I dont want them to look at me with that same level of disappointment.

I am just interested in seeing who else was in this position, and how you climbed out of it.  My kids should be enough motivation to quit drinking, altogether, but, for some reason, its not.

My mom has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. Over the years she's driven away friends and even family. As her son, I always tried to keep communication channels as open as possible but over the years with the issues going on we've been speaking less and less (due to my own fault)

Friday night I received a call that my mom was in the hospital for a myriad of issues. I went to go see her, but could only temporarily be with her due to the current situation with coronavirus. The nurse and doctor told me that given her previous history with her drinking, that this will likely be the last time I see her alive (Due to COVID19 cant come visit daily, stay by her bedside etc otherwise I would be there right now). I held her hand and told her how much I loved her and im waiting for her to get better. Then we'll go home together and i'll take care of her. She's unresponsive and I ended up just crying for the hour talking to her. The doctors told me that she was found passed out laying on the ground somewhere after several hours. 

In the past i've dumped out her alchohol and she's kicked me out of the house. Other times I voice my opinion on how I want her to stop drinking and get better and shed reply ""fuck you, your not my son"". This battle constantly occurred. The last time I was with my mom was her birthday, she was slightly intoxicated and I took her to red lobster. For 30 minutes she spoke how she needs the money if I were to die. To not include my sisters or dad in the will, only include her. After that I didnt text her that much... This past decade her drinking has become worse and worse. I've had to drive to bars to find her laying her on the ground and carry her home on several occasions. I tried hard for my mom to get her better and hope for her to lessen her drinking. She's been in and out of rehabs with no success.

If I only had been more assertive in this situation I could have helped her more. I tried but I didnt try hard enough, I'm the only one in the family who cares about her and I let her down. I should have had her live with me. Over the past few years after she divorced my dad she had basically been living boyfriend to boyfriend.

The worst part is that my mom tried to call me 4 days before she was in the hospital. I had saw the call and figured i'd give her a call back later but I just got caught up with work and other aspects of life. I dont think I'll ever forgive my self for not returning that phone call. All I had to was give her a call and offer to bring her to my place for a bit to catch up. We wouldnt be where were at right now if I had just made that call and said that...

It's also affecting me how little any of the family cares. Her exhusband didnt care at all and said it was only a matter of time. My older sister said that she also mentally prepared for this many years and only feels anger and spite against our mom... Then I was told 5 days ago that my younger sister had answered my moms phone call but replied back with stating that she never wanted to talk to her again and hung up.... My mom tried to call me one day after that but I didnt pick up. She has depressive tendencies and I could only imagine what she was feeling. I failed my mother in not returning that phone call, I failed her by not being a better son and being more assertive. I should have been a better communicator and spent time with her even if the times I visited over the years were rough. I feel such guilt that I havent talked to her in months. I was a bad son. I hope she miracously recovers and I can just take her back to my house and take care of her. I wish she didnt drink so much over the years.. shes not even 50... I love you mom and i'll always will, im so sorry.



**Update 4/13**

Earlier today I received a call from the doctor at around 2:30, notifying me that the damage was too much to recover from. They told me they can ensure a peaceful passing through end of life care to which I agreed. An hour later I received the call from the doctor notifying me that she had peacefully passed... Everyone, I want to thank you all for your kind words and support. It really means a lot to me. I love you mom, you'll always be in my heart.",54

I have been drinking for a long period of time now. About 4 years of heavy consumption, strictly at night in order to help my sleep. 

Recently (1 week ago) i experienced a pretty severe anxiety attack.
After which, I have consistently been getting anxiety.

Now during this i have kept my drinking habits the same. Havent quit, i know probably bad for my anxiety attacks.

Every morning since i wake up with an intense panic attack, followed by a day of anxiety until the last hours of the night.

Upon looking up the symptoms of DTs i found them to be very similar to my panic and anxiety disorders:


-Feeling of dread and death

-Intense shaking (legs and arms)

-Doubting whether or not what i heard was actually there

-Panic that is unable to shake and without clear causation.

-Dissocation

-Weird sensation of instant panic when attempting to fall back asleep

-unable to consistently eat 


Now when i rationalize eveything, it doesnt make sense that it would be DT's. I have not quit drinking and i have a relatively coherent stream of thought. 
Also, the intense
However, the shaking and dissociation, coupled with the uncertainty of noises around me has me on edge. My worry is that somehow my body is not metabolizing the alcohol in the way it had previously

My guess is that im currently panicking after looking up DT's symptoms, but due to the severity wanted a second opinion (i understand this is not professional medical advice, but curious if other have experienced anything similar)",2

---

Her in-laws and I drove to her town, picked up the car, found a women's homeless shelter that will let her stay, and found the bus line that takes her directly to her job (luckily she still has that).

We packed her a backpack and rolling suitcase of warm clothes, some food, sanitizing stuff, masks/gloves, and other stuff.  
We took her to get some food.

She was shaking because of what was going on but mainly due to having been binge drinking.

It was very sad and surreal. Never in all the infinite paths that our life together could have taken when we fell in love could I have imagined I'd be driving away from her in a different city at a homeless shelter. Her parents are heartbroken (but also through with helping her).

I found something like 13 bottles of the 375ML bottles (the ones around $10) of vodka in her car. 5 were unopened.

She texted today saying that she made it to work this morning and all she has to do is call to claim her spot at the shelter each day.

I also told her that it's time for us to let each other go and I'll start the divorce process and she should research Medi-cal or something.. We've been married 10 years and maybe 2 of them were good before all the drinking. I love her but the girl I fell in love with has been drowned in a sea of alcohol. (melodramatic, I know)

Anyway thanks for the help everyone.",4

When the suicidal urges get too extreme, I drink, and then I don’t feel it as strongly anymore. I’ve been drinking for about a year now, heavily, and I’ve decided it’s time to quit. I’ve “quit” for several weeks at a time before now so I’m confident that though it’ll be hard I can do it. However I’ve been drinking more than usual during this quarantine because with so much alone time the brain goes to some dark places. If I quit cold turkey will I die? I know alcohol withdrawal can kill you, and though I’ve been drinking regularly  less than a year it has been a lot of drinking. Yes I do have a therapist, for those of you about to suggest that.

But since quarantine has started I've just fallen into this spiral where it's not 3 times a week I'm getting raucously drunk but it's everynight. And every night when I get wasted I also end up eating ungodly amounts and then the next day I feel fucking awful about myself all day and then by the time 5 o'clock rolls round I'm so depressed about myself and the drinking that all I can think to do is drink. 
I made it to 11pm the other day and all of a sudden I was walking to the garage to buy wine. .
Last night I was drinking and I kept telling myself to just finish what I have (which was unwise anyway because I had half a bottle of gin) and then ate 2 pizzas. I think I clocked that this wasn't just problem drinking but sure signs that I'm an alcoholic when I was sobbing at midnight, shoveling my drunkenly ordered mozzarella sticks and just repeating in my head ""god, I'm an alcoholic"". I even started typing out this long message to my friends explaining my worry but we're in our mid 20s and all we do revolves around drinking. 
I just really don't know what to do right now. I've stopped being engaged in group chats as much because I don't want to be around conversations about drinking but then I just end up sitting at home drinking anyway. As soon as I see drinking in films I'm off. Like it comes from everywhere and it's just me and my lack of will power here and we don't stand a fucking chance. 

Any advice anyone can give me I'd be so grateful. Thankyou.",15

""You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.""

Found that one in my Facebook Memories section today from 8 years ago.

Nowadays I look back at those old Facebook statuses and smh. I think of how dysfunctional I was. I had a partner at the time, but used to make excuses not to spend time with him, because he wasn't a heavy drinker, and I wanted to spend my evenings drinking. When I got together with my work friends, it always involved alcohol and my hot tub. 

I used to black out almost every time I drank. I often fell and injured myself. I would do things, irrational things, that I couldn't recall the following day. But the evidence was around me: a hole in the wall, a broken curtain rod.

Yet, if I couldn't spend the evenings after work with a buzz, I wasn't able to function. 

Illogical, considering I wasn't functioning while I was drinking?

Yes.

We had been dating for the last month and it was all going great. However, although he always had some problem drinking, this time around I realised that this was far more serious than it was years prior. I am not an alcoholic myself (social drinker) and from this relationship, I've only recently realised that because my father was an alcoholic, I am drawn to wanting to help men like him and wanting their care and acceptance. We had quite a history where he was quite insensitive and careless towards me and much of our relationship consisted of him blowing hot and cold, however this time I felt quite positive that this would work as he really seemed to have grown up a lot. We spent the last month hanging out when he was dry and he was really emotionally engaged and receptive when any issues came about and really wanted to make it right. It really was the nicest time I've had with anyone for years.

When I saw him last, He just came out of a 2 day bender on booze and speed and the same behaviours had emerged as they did before.  I tried to resolve it the same way we did previously, he seemed to understand why I was upset, then would later retract it and say he does'nt know why I'm on his case and why I have to always overwhelm him with so many questions/problems . This went on for a long while and we were going around in circle. Then it all reached a head and he said he felt he had been interrogated for the last 10 hours and thought maybe I had 'gotten better' since we broke up last, but that I still have the same issues that lead him to break up with me in the first place. I broke into tears and was on the floor crying and in response, he got up, looked at me blankly and said he's going to clean his room and get some stuff done around the house.  The carelessness hit me pretty hard and suddenly something came over me. I looked at him squarely and told him I thought he was a wretched human being, that he treats women like shit and if he continues to live the way he does and treat people the way he does, he will end up living a lonely, miserable life and that I hated him.

I honestly felt so shocked with what came out of my mouth and I felt completely sick and angry at myself for saying these things to him.  I was on my knees apologising to him non stop, telling him I didn't mean to hurt him and I wish I didn't say any of those things and I wanted to take it all back. He said that it was ok , that he was hurt but he doesn't think of me differently. He then said he was going to go for a walk to go to the shops and will be back in 15. When he got back, he skulled down a 6 pack of cider and half a bottle of wine in about an hour and began getting really angry and argumentative with me, accusing me of starting on him when I wasn't saying anything ( I was super quiet and passive during this time). All of a sudden, out of nowhere he told me he wanted me out his house. When I was packing my things to go, he told me that I am a miserable c\*\*t and will be the one who ends up lonely and I'll have a hard time finding someone who will put up with me and my BPD (something I have been working really hard to treat for the last 2 years through extensive therapy). He also kept on repeating that I am the one who is wretched. I was in tears, telling him to stop saying these things to me and he said that if I'm going to dish it, I should take it and told me to fuck off out of his life.

I tried to call him the day after to tell him I didn't want to end things on such bad terms and I was so sorry for the hurtful things I said. He then told me that if I was a man he would have kicked me in the head for saying what I said, but he didn't because he doesn't hit women. I tried to explain that I really wanted to be on good terms with him. He became more agitated and told me his other exes (all of whom he is close friends with) never verbally abused him, don't overwhelm him with so many problems/questions and give him his space, so I will never have that place in his life and hung up.

I am seriously so ashamed and guilty for lashing out at him the way I did and feel completely responsible for the demise of this relationship. Most of all I am terrified  that his drinking could escalate as a result of this and kill him. I spoke to his girlfriend before me (who seems like a really good person) and she said she had to take him to hospital for alcohol poisoning twice after they broke up and the doctors said he could have died if she didn't find him out in public, completely disoriented. She assured me not to blame myself for him potentially doing this again and he'd do it to himself anyway, but I feel like the words I said could have driven him to kill himself.

 If anyone is able to provide any insight and support from the perspective of an alcoholic/loved one of an alcoholic, that would be really appreciated.",2

There was a good stretch of a few months about 9-14 months ago when I didn't drink much, but since then it's been trying to not drink so much but ending up drinking around 20 drinks a week a more. It's cut down some since I don't meet my friends with whom I used to drink a lot due to the quarantine, but I still enjoy how drinking feels when I'm at home playing games or about to eat dinner. I feel like I always do the same shit, drink till I get drunk enough to not care about what I will eat then order an unhealthy pile of food to devour causing me to have to drink so much water I am waking up every 2 hours to drink and pee until it's early morning and I won't be able to sleep again for at least several hours. I drink coffee thinking it helps prevent liver damage and sometimes wallow in despair that I have ruined my body and mind from drinking so much. The depressing thoughts that I have drank away my potential and my health hit especially hard after that 2 or 3rd day of drinking straight with a foggy mind. I obtain supplements like DHM and sylmarin to prevent the damage I have certainly done to my liver, knowing there is no repairing the body from drinking this much. I feel my healthfulness starting to return after that day of abstinence and then letting myself believe my throat and stomach are fine after 2 days of rest. Forgetting that hope to abstain for at least 2 weeks, because I heard 2 weeks is enough time for the liver to fix itself usually. I'm 35 now and I've wanted to control my drinking since I was 27. From 22-27, I drank whenever I could as much as I wanted. From 20-22, I drank nearly every single night about .375 of hard liquor. I still am on the fence about whether or not I will be having those 8-12 beers tonight. I don't want to be a ""drinker"" any more, but I wish I could want it more than drinking.",3

I’m REALLY struggling with my addiction right now. I had a year sober and relapsed a month ago. This past month I’ve been drinking on and off. 

I got kicked out of my sober house and moved in with my mom last week. She lives in the middle of nowhere so there’s no liquor stores within walking distance, and she took my keys so I couldn’t drive anywhere. So I had alcohol delivered. It was just gonna be once, but a couple days later I did it again. 

This morning she busted me (my room smelled like alcohol). I had been lying all week pretending to be serious about getting sober. I even started outpatient today. I’m struggling so bad... I want to be sober again, I really do!! But I want to order more alcohol so badly right now. 

Of course, she now took my ID, so I’d have to be even more sneaky. I’d either have to steal my ID back or try to order it in my brother’s name and use his old one downstairs. My brain is going crazy trying to come up with ideas on how to make this work. 

So I’m writing this just to be honest for once, even if it’s to complete strangers. Thanks for reading.",10

Long story short, my wife is a big time alcoholic for most of her life.  
I won't bore you with all the stories but for context, she has been living in a town 4 hours away that started out as her going to a rehab there for several months and then she ended up just living there with someone she met in rehab that became her friend.

She has been there over a year.  
The last time she came to visit us (about a month ago), she showed up drunk.

That friend called today and said she has been binge drinking for months and she can't have her stay there any longer, especially since it's a sober-living facility and she has kids and is worried about getting kicked out because of my wife.

So my in-laws and myself will be driving there to get her car (which I pay for, is in both our names, and we're worried about her drunk drive crashing it - she constantly drunk drives).     

Also the plan is to take her from her friend's sober living home and leaving her at a homeless shelter.

We're not taking her back. We've done that for years and we're all pretty much done with her.   
We all love her but she will not change.

Anyway, so my question is what kind of options do we have for places to take her? Women's shelter, homeless shelter, just leave her in the street without a vehicle?   

I'm sure some will wonder why I don't divorce her. Probably the thing keeping me from going through with that is that she's on my insurance and any rehab or therapy was being covered by my insurance. She told me she hasn't been to a therapist for a while though.

As for places to leave her - or what we can do with her besides bringing her back home - any suggestion or info anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much!

**edit** Thank you so far for all the well wishes and info. I want to point out that my wife isn't vindictive or petty or anything like that. In fact she's very sweet and when it comes to all this, she feels incredibly guilty. That's also probably a reason she drinks. If we divorced, she wouldn't ask for a single thing. When it comes to the car, she has told me multiple times I should take it because ""it's mine"" and she doesn't deserve it. When it comes to alcoholism, she knows she's an alcoholic and feels incredible guilt and remorse. I can't explain what makes her pick up that drink utterly knowing it's going to ruin everything, but I suspect if we knew that, we'd be able to cure this horrible disease.",3

Covid has brought me to my childhood home for the first time in a while and a lot of feeling have resurfaced and I really just want to vent.

I think my childhood was pretty good until I was around 10 or so. I really can't remember when exactly it started anymore, I think I have surpressed a lot of upsetting childhood memories. At some point around that age my mother's drinking really ramped up. While she was cruel to me and my younger brother, it was less so than how she treated my father. For years I would just watch her yell at my father for seemingly no reason. She would just yell and call him names for hours and hours.

 My least favorite memory that sums this up is one night during my Hanukah ( my family observes Judaism very loosely) , My father, my brother, and I were lighting the candles and singing a Hanukah blessing. While we were doing so, my mother repeatedly screamed the word ""faggot"" at my father. We just all did our best to ignore her.

This was far from a one off event. My father would occasionally plead with her to stop speaking to him in such a demeaning manner,  but she would just double down.  Rarely it would turn mildly violent, she would throw shoes or glasses at him.

For years this was my normal life, until my parents officially got divorced when I about 14. Of course their marriage was over long before this unofficially. They had not slept in the same bed for years. I think my father endured this for so many years just for me and brother. Just clinging to our once normal and happy life.  I don't think this was the best course of action but this is what he did.

My father moved into an apartment in the same city, me and my brother intially evenly split our time between the two households. I slowly started spending more and more time at my mother's house.

This was not becauase I enjoyed her company more. I did this because she was not supervising me at all. I could do litterally whatever I wanted. At first this just meant neglecting   my homework for video games. This later developed into me smoking weed and nicotine daily for years. I'm just starting to break the grips these vices have had on me now. 

In the past few months I've felt like Ive been needlessly abusing these substances, as I've been reavulating and drastically reducing my use. . After being at my mother's home ( I can't stay with my father currently as his immune system is already compromised)  for less than 12 hours I have cried atleast 6 times and it seems so clear why I started abusing. I have steered pretty clear of alcohol consumption because it's hard for me to separate the substance from my shitty childhood.

I've also noticed she's gotten worse since I last saw her in January. She was already really drunk when I got home at 430pm today (she's drunk by 6pm everyday) but she seemed less aware of her surroundings than normal, repeating herself multiple times several minutes apart. 

Tonight my extended family did a breif Passover(Jewish holiday) ceremony over zoom. I felt so ashamed of my mother. She was falling in and out of consciousness on camera and kept saying rude things about my family members. I don't think they could hear her but I'm not sure. She passed out in her bed no more than 5 minutes after the call ended.

I think I'm watching her wither away infront of me, and at this point I hardly care. She has brought me so much more pain than joy in my life and I hardly see her as my mother. 

I was initially planning to go into more detail with this post but I feel like I've already painted most of the picture I want to with everything I've written so far.

I'm in need of an accountability buddy for the next few weeks - a temporary sponsor, if you will. Here's a brief history for ya:

I am 28 year old male and recently moved out of my dad's house who is also alcoholic after living with him for the last 2 years. I moved there (and this is going to sound crazy) right after 4 months of rehab (1 IP, 3 IOP). I intended to try a method of tapering off alcohol using Naltrexone. As you probably guessed, I didn't get the results I was hoping for. I must say it, did prevent me from sinking to the depths I had gone to before treatment but I was still drinking at way unhealthy levels (think like 8-10 drinks on the worst days throughout this last year vs 12-14 on any given weekend back in 2017). 
About a month ago, I was getting frustrated with not being able to live up to my potential, not getting things done, putting off schoolwork etc. I was just stagnating and I couldn't find the will to really change anything. It was just to easy to put it off, weeks become months, you know how it is. 
Fortunately, my aunt offered to let me stay with her so I can get back on track without too much pressure. So for this last month I've been drinking between 3-6 beers a day, that is, up until Sunday. On Monday I started tapering off and it's been going just fine (still taking Naltrexone as I ought). Tonight I had 2. Tomorrow is 1 and then Friday is 0. 

The place I'm in is very supportive and I'm not really worried about going on a bender or anything. I mostly just want someone I can tell, ""Hey, I did good today."" other than my aunt or my cousin who's home from college because of Covid-19. 

Thanks",3

I need advice,"Apologies in advance for the text wall, but I am very frustrated and hurt right now, and I need some advice, please. TLDR at the bottom. 

My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) have been dating for 6 months. He has an alcohol problem that he has had for years (even before he knew me), but he keeps it secret from everyone and has been managing his life fairly well despite his addiction. I didn't know about his problem until some months into our relationship. He gets drunk at home alone every 2 or 3 days. He has tried to stop many times, but he can't even go 1 week without drinking. He is too proud to ask for help because he's embarrassed and he wants to manage it on his own. But he obviously can't. 

My biggest problem is that he becomes a different person when he's drunk. Almost every disagreement/argument we've ever had has been because of his drinking. Not because I'm mad about him having a drinking problem, but because when he's drunk he gets mad about things that don't make sense. He starts conflicts for the sake of it and talks down to me. He's unpleasant and sometimes rude. He's not like this at all when he's sober. As a result of this, I've told him I don't want to see him when he's been drinking. I've accepted that I can't help him with his addiction (not that I haven't tried) and that he's going to have to help himself, and I've said I'm just not going to hang out with him when he's been drinking. He says this is completely fair and respects my decision. Or so I thought...

Two days ago we agreed on him visiting me today. I've been working and we haven't had much time to see each other, but for once I don't have work in the morning. When I got home from work (about an hour ago) he was already in my apartment, which is fine (he has a key). But he had only been here for about 30 mins and he had 3 different alcoholic beverages opened on different counter tops and tables. Two of them were mine that he had taken out of my fridge without asking. 

I was annoyed because I'd told him I don't want to see him when he's been drinking, but he said he'd ""only"" had 6 beers at home. Doing some quick maths, that's 9 drinks if he were to finish the 3 in my apartment. And there was no promise of him stopping after that. I took one of the beers (that was from my fridge) and poured it down the drain, because I didn't want him to become even more unpleasant than he already was. He got mad about this and decided to leave. I didn't stop him. 

Now I'm left feeling both hurt and angry. I don't know what to do. I love him very much when he's sober. I understand that it's an addiction and that it's not easy, but I don't know how to handle it. 
Is there any way I can help him at this point? I really don't want to leave him, but his alcohol problem is hurting me and hurting our relationship. Maybe someone has some advice or just a word of comfort. 

TLDR: Boyfriend knew he was going to see me today, and he also knew I don't want to see him when he's been drinking, but he decided to drink anyways. When I got annoyed and poured one of his beers (which he had taken from my fridge without asking) down the drain, he decided to leave. Effectively choosing to drink alcohol rather than spend time with his girlfriend. I feel like his alcohol problem is ruining our relationship. Any advice would be appreciated.",4

Repeatedly I have straight up asked close friends if they thought I was, their response always “no”, and then we would go out drinking that weekend. I tell myself I don’t drink to get drunk, I drink because I enjoy the social and the taste, but I can throw back half a bottle of liquor in a night if I wanted. I can’t say, maybe it’s I don’t want to say that I am an alcoholic, but what I do know that it is destroying my health both mental and physical, and specifically making this one person despise me enough that they don’t want to be around me.

Although I know there will be hard days ahead when I feel like slipping, I truly proved to myself I could be sober. I’m way happier than I was 3 months ago.

And to warn others who may be in the same spot. Because I have no idea why this is happening all of the sudden. So here's my story. 

I'm 33 years old, and I've been a pretty consistent drinker for a long time. I only drink beer nowadays because liquor is too much for me, and I was getting out of hand. So for the past year or two it's just been beer. I drink between 3-6 beers daily and sometimes a few more on the weekend. Mostly 16oz coors lite, and the occasional IPA. Typically I don't start drinking till around 5 or 6 PM and have the occasional off day on the weekend when I drink a little too much the night before. Well this past weekend I did just that. I went a little hard on Friday, and decided not to drink Saturday to give myself some recovery. Everything going normal as usual, spend the day laying around relaxing. Then Sunday rolls around, and about half way through the day, hours before I typically start drinking I start feeling kinda crappy. I think maybe I'm coming down with something, and maybe I'm just dehydrated. So I decide I probably shouldn't drink. Then half way through Sunday night the shakes start, and I wonder if I'm having an alcohol withdrawal. I have one beer left in my fridge and it's too late to go buy more. I drink the one beer and feel slightly better for about 30 mins and then right back to feeling sick, realizing that I am in fact withdrawaling. I decide to try and sleep it off and go to bed. I sleep great and wake up Monday feeling energetic but notice the shaking is still happening, and I'm having some trouble focusing. It continues to get worse as the day goes on and around 5 or 6 pm I decide to go get more beer to try and feel better. I get home and drink about 4 beers and I feel normal as can be and go to bed. Fast forward to 4am and my eyes shoot open and I'm wide awake. I toss and turn till 8am when I finally get up because I can't sleep. The sweating and shaking sets in again and worsen though out the day. I'm starting to worry at this point. 6pm rolls around and I feel horrible. I decide it's probably safer to drink than not at this point and just try and taper off over time after reading about alcohol withdrawal online. So I drink, everything feels better again except I'm exhausted from getting no sleep and feeling horrible all day. Cut to Wednesday and here I am, only slept about 5 hours before I started to withdrawal again, it's happening faster and I'm now considering going to the ER. Terrified because I have no health insurance and am out of a job currently because of Covid. I have no idea why my body is detoxing so quick and sending me into a withdrawal after 6 or 7 hours of not drinking. I used to go at least 14 hours or more with no booze and never had an issue. I don't think tapering is going to work at this point. All because I took an extra day off of drinking I feel I can't go back.",6

Lost every job I was in due to alcoholism. Got used to seeing those let down faces of my coworkers. Decieved myself as being a functional alcoholic, because more or less I was succesfull in everything asocial at my jobs, decieved myself that working 7 days a week would make up for everything, decieved myself by drowning those little obvious things, decieved myself that improvising on the moment is a virtue. Felt myself invisible and invincible.Was waiting my whole life for THAT chance, to get out of the circle and be fruitful and respected, and independent. Got all the priveledges in a new city, from a bum to a potential head of department (shit, I was given corporate flat for free, all I had to do was to get up in the mornings and pay the bills) (i'm in education, but I had to do manufacturing and programming as well, lots of things). Could not stop. Decieved and self-harmed myself, without rational me knowing it. Decieved myself about who I am. Infantile subconcious took over. Drank myself to death. Missed my train to finish my 20s decade (26 y.o.) with a real life-changer. Transition yourself and finally get out of this trap I was in. It was so close. Let everybody down, my family, my sister. My future. What could have been the greates change of my life.I was the right man at the right time and I had a destiny.Now I came back, nothing. Sobered up, got to meetings, but what for? I am broke, shitty reputation, no money, not even a few bucks to pay for internet and work from home as everybody does. Shit, I do not even have any proper clothes for a new interview.But all the previous is my personal hell and situation, and I am fully responsible for everything I did with my mind and soul. Te mind - is what bothers me. I am absolutely, absolutely scared of what I have done to my cognitive abilities. It terrifies me that I now I see clearly all of the faults of my personality, that I can not absolutely concentrate to even start working on myself. I forget things I have done 10 minutes ago. I have no energy without a drink, and drink only gives false motivation and false assumptions and I end up regretting to the point of crying, of what a crappy person was invading (and still is on the drunk side of subconcious) my every thought this whole time. I am not that person, not anything my drunk or regretful mind paints me. I can not bear to hate myself, because true me would just get his ass together and rebuild his life. But I can't. I do not see an exit for myself even rationally, for the place I've put myself into.I just want a normal and, perhaps, achieved life. Instead, I've got a drunkard medal on my forehead.I read a lot about psychology and alcoholism behavior and its effects on rationale. But what does it give me? I have no hope. Can I start over? Can I still be valid as a person? Next year I am 27 and I completely lost in that transition all because of that darn bottle. No, me, of course.",3

As it is right now I am drinking about 675-740 ml of Soju (20%) every night. Before moving to Korea I was just drinking enough cheap whiskey to make the room spin and knock me out for sleep. Ive been drunk every single night for about two years straight and I'm sick of how it is affecting my social life, work life, and my enjoyment. I've tried to cut back on drinking on my own countless times, but I've failed every time and only make it a few days before I'm drinking like I used to. I really need help on what to do if anybody can offer some advice. 

 For the past three months it feels like alcohol has been making things harder and harder for me. I have been canceling plans to go out in the evening because I start to seriously zone out and get anxious around 5:00 pm about being away from alcohol. I've had this constant brain fog for the past few months that only leaves me for maybe two hours a day. It feels like I'm not even fully conscious because it's so heavy and doesn't let me really enter reality. It sounds stupid, but its like there's this wall between me and other people that has appeared and I'm experiencing everything second hand. I get extremely tired to the point that my last two hours of work (I'm a teacher and right now we have a few more weeks before students come back because of COVID-19) are just me staring at my computer trying not to fall asleep. I've been getting headaches and chest tightness that don't go away until I start drinking again. At the same time my chest is tightening my heart just beats and beats and beats, but it all dissapears when I drink. 

Today I was going to visit a hospital to see about detox or medicine according to what I needed, but the friend who was going to bring me ended up saying it wasn't a good idea to go to the hospital. He is a coworker of mine who I trust, and his concern was that if I went to the hospital for a long time I may get the coronavirus and then bring it back to school for when the students come back. That would be horrible for the school's image and we would probably lose a lot of students from their parents pulling them out. I understood his point, but the virus will be here for a long time yet, and I desperately need to get my alcohol problem solved before my students come back. I can't keep pushing back the date on solving this because it is going to affect my classes too much. Every morning I'm hungover, and by 6:00pm I am a zombie. I'll be teaching kids from 9:00-6:00 every day during the times where I'm still partially drunk or craving alcohol.

I'm sorry if this isn't all very well explained. If anybody has any suggestions they can give me on how to handle this in a foreign country, I would seriously appreciate it.",2

How do you make yourself hate it?,"In February I went to hospital and was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis from alcohol abuse. I was drinking about 20 units or more a day for about 4 years, and now I can’t drink without risking my life. The problem I have is that while I know it caused so many problems for me (ultimately cutting my life short and putting me in a lot of pain) I am still in love with it. I would never have stopped drinking unless I was forced to. I’ve never been interested in getting better, and I unfortunately have managed to romanticised self destruction so much that I don’t want to get better. I can recognise that it’s just addiction but I still can’t stop wanting it. I don’t want to be sober but I will be, but it’s torture seeing alcohol and just wishing that I could still drink. 

I don’t like being sober. I just straight up don’t like the mental state and I don’t think I ever will. But I’m sure there’s a way for me to see sobriety as a good thing. How? I’m sorry I’m being miserable but I miss booze so bad. I want the chaos of it all, I don’t like being in control. I want to be able to be happy sober.

My dad had a fall from disorientation. He stupidly wasn't taking enough meds to lower his ammonia, bc it made him use the bathroom all the time--duh. So he reduced it, fell over in the bathroom, and we found him after I don't know how long...

He's in the hospital now. When he arrived they said his ammonia levels were at 61. 2 days later they are at 106. 
What ammonia level are they referring to? They said 61 was ""elevated,"" But now 106 is pretty high I'm guessing if 61 was just elevated...

His body temperature is at 93. They had trouble getting an accurate reading, and finally did it rectally. I'm assuming this low body temperature is a pretty bad sign? I know the liver helps regulate it...

New here and am 33 F. I have decided to stop drinking as I am very scared right now. Last weekend I drank 3 days straight. I am usually a wine drinker during the week but with this quarantine went overboard over those 3 days. I ended up going to the bathroom and had black stool. Ran to urgent care next morning and they said could be Gastritis or maybe ulcer. gave me some acid blockers. Havent drank since Tuesday afternoon. Black stool is gone but now I have yellow/light brown stool and is still making me nervous as I've gone down a Google rabbithole. Did anyone ever have any of these symptoms--i have no other symptoms really. Please I'm so scared. I am done with drinking.",6

My ex-girlfriend is struggling, much like everyone at the moment, and is getting through each day binge drinking as I understand. We don't maintain consistent contact as you can imagine and, at first, things ended very badly for both of us. I had finished my undergrad and she was in the process of graduating herself, and the stress really devastated us both in a lot of ways. Things are more amicable now and we still talk occasionally given the isolation. 

I never noticed but she handled her school stress with occasional drinks. I'm no hypocrite, I smoked a lot of ganj myself to get through. But things have really worsened and she's contending with some really dark feelings with alcohol. Worse yet, she's stuck in the house with a family that enables it everyday.

Another ex lost her father to this bitter addiction while we were together and I can't stand to see someone I care about be destroyed by it again.

Im 25 year old male, with 80kg (about 160 pounds?). So i have this totally random blackouts and im going to describe it, so maybe people will relate and give me a tip or two.

Last few times i drank, i always got blackout drunk. Even if i have mindset i will just drink 1 cup of wine, i get fucking blackout drunk. I mean its not black and white like this, but for reference let me describe yesterday. I had dinner with my family. We were not like ""yeah, lets get drunk!"", it was dinner with some wine. I didnt want to drink, i didnt want to get drunk, but yeah i will drink a cup of wine with my family. And that is what i remember. I drank a cup of wine. But after that i dont remember any fucking thing. I dont know how much i drank, what we were talking, nothing. Even in the morning my parents told me that they dont know how i got drunk that fast since i didnt drink a lot. I even puked at the end. 

I assumed for a lot of my blackouts that it was because i had empty stomach, but that was not the case yesterday. I might mixed some alcohol. I mean i had like very small glass of strong alcohol (dont know how to say that type of alcohol in english) before dinner, for disinfection purposes (atleast we are joking like that in family, we dont get hammered with that shit).

I dont have drunk or middle phase last few times. I say there are 3 phases of drinking: sober, drunk, blackout. I'm not even drunk, just straight to blackout. 3 or 5 years ago i was drinking every weekend with my friends and this shit never happened, but now all the time.

So yeah if anyone can relate, please explain me wtf is going on.",3

2020-04-04 14:21:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fuyjpx/advise_about_my_mother/,Advise about my Mother,"Hi everyone,

I need advice on how to deal with my mother who I believe has an alcoholism problem. 

My mother is 64 years old, she drinks over 2 liters of wine a day yet overall appears highly functional. I’ve suspected she adds some hard liquor to the wine but never really found it. Now my father (who is on really poor terms with her but living together) tells me there is a jar where she keeps vodka and adds that to the wine. 

In the past months she has left something running on the stove (propane, open flame) twice. 

I usually leave my one year old daughter with her and we never had a problem. 

Now with Covid she’s specially irritable since she lives for family gatherings and we’re all quarantined. 

She refuses to go to therapy which I would gladly pay for. 

She realizes these are not healthy choices and that she might have a problem but avoids confrontation or just reacts violently when brought up. Usually saying she doesn’t want to change, she might as well die than change her habits, eat better or drink less. 

I don’t have siblings and my father tells me about the situation but if he were even to bring it up with her she would absolutely snap, the relationship is almost at the divorce stage. 

I really don’t know what to do... I fear if I bring it up she’ll just snap and enter denial. 

Her father had dementia around his mid 70s. 

On the good side, she’s super sweet with me, my wife and our daughter and during family gatherings she’s very functional, usually cooks and tends to everyone, yet she keeps her bottle on the kitchen instead of the table to avoid judgement. 

She is super anxious all the time and I imagine the alcohol would help smooth things out, yet she refuses to take clonazepam or even go to a psychiatrist. 

Sorry if this is all over the place, I fear that a confrontation where I threaten to not take my daughter there anymore will be too cruel and that she’s not that far gone mentally. 

How can I get through to her with love and understanding so that she can start down a path of healing and improvement?

She has a support system here, an 85yo mother, a brother of 59 and myself an only child. But I think she’ll feel attacked if we try an intervention. 

Thanks for any recommendations,",2

I’m tired. I’m 26, female, my birthday is coming up soon and I sincerely dont want to be like this anymore....for the last 5 years I’ve been drinking a case of beer a day, with the dumb logic that “atleast it’s not liquor anymore!”, cause I used to drink a bottle of rum per day. I started drinking heavily at home when I figured out alchohol helped my anxiety go away. early on I didnt think I was doing anything wrong, just having fun, I actually used to get snappy with people when they expressed concern. I figured I could just stop whenever I wanted to...but when I tried the first time, it was too late. I’ve failed every attempt to stop. I’ve gone a few months in before and fell right back off as soon as something stressful happened. now I cant even go 2 days. the longest I managed in the last year was 5 days before the boredom and headaches were too much. that or I think to myself “hmm it’s been a few days, I bet I can be good and just have one!”. I’ve so strongly associated ANY activity with having a drink- it doesnt matter where I am. at home, out shopping, with friends....even shamefully, I’ve driven around drunk and been hammered at work....thats the one that kills me the most. I HATE myself. I dont feel healthy, I don’t take care of myself, my heart feels strained. I have tremors. I sleep like shit, I’m hungover ALL the time.....alcohol is responsible for a few psychotic breakdowns as well. my mental health will never be the same from them, but its never enough to make me quit. I used to paint, write, exercise, spend time normally without this addiction....the days that I can manage to go without drinking, I feel so clear and motivated, I actually get things done! but I ruin it the next day with more drinking. And now that everything is on lockdown and I can’t work for months, I’m just staring down the time and thinking god, I CAN’T go through every single one of these days drunk. it’s put things in perspective. I wont make it. clearly I can’t do this by myself, I just need help....I need to get over this.",13

Been drinking Everclear mixed with random stuff for 2 weeks straight.,"Well, I fucked up. I've never been addicted to alcohol before this. Had a lot of crazy shit happen in my life and I've now been drinking Everclear mixed with whatever sweet drink I had on hand for 2 weeks straight. Had maybe a day off each time.

How bad are the withdrawals gonna be? I have some Clonazolam (a research chemical benzodiazapine) on hand that could help with withdrawal. I noticed tonight I was feeling extra cold, anxious, shaky, etc before I drank some.

Are there any tapering guides? Should I just drink a tiny bit just enough to not feel bad? I'm usually pretty commited and can control myself when tapering off something like this. I'm very stubborn and will usually just push through any withdrawals as I did with kratom (shout out to /r/quittingkratom). Goddamn that wirhdrawal was bad. Was on it for a year and a half and the withdrawals were so bad I didn't sleep for a LITERAL week and was hallucinating music constantly.

This seems like a totally different beast though potentially.

Thanks everyone. Pretty scared over here, especially with the coronavirus situation. Want to get this over with as soon as possible and stop drinking.

It honestly could've been more than 2 weeks, time just kind of gets away from you when drinking. Note that I would only drink at night and usually would feel fine-ish during the day.

Edit: I've decided to start taking kratom again instead of tapering off the alcohol and using Clonazolam. Clonazolam is just too dangerous. I'd rather be addicted to kratom again and taper down from that than be at risk of dying from either of those other substances. I know it might be dumb and I'm sure the kratom withdrawals will be hell again, but I really don't want to be at risk of death and the alcohol withdrawals were actually quite hellish today. Slipped and had to have a small drink. No more. Any comments would be appreciated on this approach or other ideas. I really don't want to go to a doctor as I have a lot of preexisting conditions and if I catch the virus it would hit me HARD I think.",22

We turn into something we would have never expected but there is ALWAYS a way out, a way to succeed and a way to pull yourself back to that heartwarming, person that you lost. In my situation I LOVED to go out have fun with friends and drink. For others it could be something completely different. Some of us don't realize the things we are doing until something bad happens or you end up hurting your health. But it's never to late to help yourself and think what is more important in life. A future. A family. Support. Love. And much more. I have recently learned to put the partying behind me, put the drink down and enjoy the memories in the moment and the people whom you love and cherish because one day we all won't be here. Unfortunately it took me a while to actually process this because to me my priorities were not all there. But now I know my new chapter will be so much better. 
Thank you to all of those who have stood by me and loved me no matter what!
The journey begins and I want to enjoy all of it with all of you.

I had no idea he was an alcoholic until I moved in with him. He was drinking about four 40oz bottles and about 24 cans or more a day as well bottles of everclear and vodka. As much as I tried helping him as well as all his friends he absolutely refused to slow down drinking. He was in the hospital a couple times a month and barely working and couldn't pay his half the rent. He was constantly lying about his drinking and work.

I found someone to replace him, he was a bit better but was an angry drunk and would get jealous if he saw me with my girlfriend at the time and start punching holes in the walls. He at least didn't sneak alcohol and was able to work.

The roommate I just kicked out last week said he was sober for 10 years or something and was going to AA meetings and meeting with his sponsor on a regular basis. But something happened and he ended up drinking himself into oblivion. Unaware of everything he has said or done that night. Even rear ended the fuck out of someone and ran from the ambulance when it stopped and went back to his shop to drink more. He used me as a designated driver since his car got totalled. Sometimes he'd just stay at his shop and drink until 4am and would call me to pick him up. He was a wonderful guy when sober but when drinking he's sometimes make me drink with him and give him rides any time of day or night.

And now. One of my old co-workers just called me saying she's drunk and sad and needed someone to talk to. 

I'm really trying not to be judgemental but it's starting to get hard.",38

I just wanted to share my story, well..my family and I’s story. In hopes that people going through the same can change their life around. My dad was a committed alcoholic. Since I can remember he would drink atleast 4-5 days a week. The most he went without drinking was maybe a month. I came to terms that my father had a disease. When I was younger I resented him for all he put us through. I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t want to change his life for us.. for his own kids. Alcohol took over his life. He hasn’t worked for over 15 years, he works 2 weeks then gets paid and quits because once he gets that first check he has money to afford his liquor. He goes months without working and is on and off. I worked as soon as I was able to. At 15 I would help my mother by atleast paying for the things I needed. Because she was the only one putting food on the table for us. I am 21 now. My dad was getting worse and worse throughout the years and my heart hurts knowing that I couldn’t do more to help him fight this disease. My mother put up with him and loved him despite everything she has gone through. I never had the father daughter relationship with him because growing up I saw him as this mean bad guy who just lived with us. I acted like he was just not there, I ignored all the name calling. The only time I would speak to him is if he came to me while sober and tried speaking to me. That or trying to stop him from arguing with my mother. My dad was constantly told to stop drinking but he couldn’t stop. It seemed impossible for him. I don’t know what it’s like to live with this disease, I don’t know if he was actually trying to stop but just couldn’t because the disease took over him. I don’t know what was going on in his head. I don’t know what demons he was fighting. The days he would stop drinking.. the withdrawal it was scary. Seeing him argue with people who were not there seeing him all shaky and scared. Then one month he went on drinking nonstop. My mother told me he would fall and couldn’t get up on his own. He was constantly drunk so she didn’t think anything of it. Little did we know that was a symptom of the internal bleeding he was going through. My dad threw up a lot of blood a day after he kept falling. In that moment he was terrified. My mother was terrified. In that moment he begged God not to take his life yet. In that moment he knew he came to a point in which his body couldn’t take it anymore. He was sent to the ICU. They had to intubate him to take care of the  bleeding. He spoke to my mother and my sister over the phone before that and he reassured us he would be fine. They also reassured him he would be okay because they didn’t think he would end up leaving us. My heart hurts knowing that it was his last conversation. That I didn’t get a chance to speak to him. His blood pressure dropped, and all that blood loss affected his brain. He had cirrhosis. His liver was so damaged. The doctors weren’t sure why he wasn’t waking up and he couldn’t get an MRI because he was so unstable. On the 6th day of being in the ICU he was stable enough to take an MRI. The MRI revealed extensive damage to the brain. My heart sank. There was nothing reversible the doctors could do. They said there was a great chance he would never wake up from this. So we faced the tough decision of taking him off the ventilator as his brain was also swelling and pushing in his skull. I was with my dad the whole time, I told him I loved him that everything was going to be fine. I reassured him that we will be fine. That he was going to be fine. I didn’t want to worry him because some say they can still hear you. I told him to rest. On March 14 he passed away. He was 45. Seeing my dad die was one of the toughest things I have ever done. My whole body felt numb. It felt surreal and still does. I’m glad I was there with him in his final days. But I also wish I could have spent more time with him.. I wish I spoke to him more. I wish so many things. I wish I could of done more for him. I miss him so much. I just want to hug him one last time but I can’t. Alcoholism is a disease idc what people say. Please get help if you need it or know if somebody who does. I hope anyone who is going through alcoholism finds strength to turn their life around. Blessings to everybody.",9

2020-04-03 05:28:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/fu5ayc/alcoholism_family_and_covid19/,"Alcoholism, Family, and Covid-19","Hello members of r/alcoholism About a month ago I made a post regarding a support group I felt was harmful to my brothers recovery. Since then I convinced my brother to tell me the name of his support group (Smart Recovery), purchased their friends and family handbook (they don't seem to supply much information online), and read through it for advice regarding how to handle my brothers alcoholism on a personal level. Some of it is decent advice like ""Set boundaries, don't bail him out of consequences, don't blame yourself, etc"" and other bits are slightly mystifying like the section on nagging as it's not explained the best (like is it nagging when I ask 'where you off too?' when he suddenly heads out at midnight?). In short the book was helping me at least partly understand what he would use to put me down during his frequent verbal attacks when things didn't go his way and deal with his outbursts in a more healthy manner.

Now we get to the point of the post. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 and the fear it caused many businesses closed down to protect customers and people are being instructed to social distance. This kind of puts an end to attending a support group for him especially as my mother whom we reside with has a weak immune system and respiratory problems so any exposure to this could kill her fairly easily. Well his habit of spending all of his money did take a slight twist since the outbreak, he has now spread out his spending and gone to the liquor store every night save one for ten days and now that he is broke has been trying to trick myself and my mother into giving him more money (even if we didn't have an outbreak in the area I live in I wouldn't). It seems like any progress he was making has gone out the window since this began and we've only been in partial isolation for about two weeks. What I'm asking it how can I deal with these new challenges? Do any of you know of similar online groups I can refer him to so he at least has people he can be fully open with when he's having cravings? Any advice what I can do would be appreciated as I really don't know what to do at this time.",2

I finally took myself to an AA meeting but a week later I couldn’t go again as due to lock down I had to come home.Since  being home I find myself hiding how much I drink from my dad (who is not a big drinker at all ) ans not being able to have a night without it ...I’ve got bottles piling up under the bed.Just tonight he made a snide comments hat I drink too much which I do but my problem is beyond even having a sober night or a night off the booze 
.
I don’t know what to do or how to cope .",1

At first the problems didnt seem too bad, but the last few years I have been ruining my health and every single one of my relationships.  Only my mother and a close family friend still talk to me.

Saturday marked the day that changed everything for me.  My fiance who is now ex fiance got in a fight and I ended up swatting her arm.  Long story short I got a 72 hour no contact with her and my 2 year old son (just because he is in the same residence).  

The next day I went to court expecting the 72 hours to be maintained and to be able to go on with my garbage life.  Since covid 19 is here judges and attorneys are hard to come by and I am now unable to see my son until August.  He is the only thing I care about in this world and I am so broken up.  

I am tired of living this way.  I am tired of trying to quit and failing over and over again.  I'm tired of being ruled by alcohol and letting it take over my life.  I dont know what to do anymore....",34

Yes I know that I need to see a doctor (I have a telehealth appointment tomorrow) but in the meantime I wanted to get everyone’s opinions because I have become a nervous nelly these past couple of days.

I get really bad gastritis/GERD when I drink for like more than a week. I decided to go to urgent care the other day because it was just getting unbearable. So I went and they decided to do a liver function test because apparently where my GERD pain was is also where your liver is.

So flash forward the following day they call me back to say my enzymes are slightly elevated. W-T-F. Now- I am by no means drinking as much as some people I know and I’m only 25yo. I don’t drink all day and all night. I’d say I had been drinking earlier in the day due to this outbreak but even still never before like 1pm.

Now this obviously was scary enough for me that I decided to quit. I’m about 14 hours into it and feel relatively ok- the only thing scaring me is I have a pain on my right side right under my rib cage. Now I’m thinking it could be gallstones or a fatty liver. Ugh I’m just at a loss. If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated.",6

I was wondering if I were to taper off, would my anxiety get better with the less usage? Also what is a good way to taper yourself off? Thank you in advance.",7
