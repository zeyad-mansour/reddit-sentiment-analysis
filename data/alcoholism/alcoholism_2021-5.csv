My father was a severe alcoholic, as was his dad. My dad died at 42, from an alcohol/oxy induced heart attack. 

After a ten year marriage to an alcoholic husband, I finally was able to leave; ten days later he took his own life. I am now a widow raising four kids. 
It wasn‚Äôt until after his death, that I realized how severe his alcoholism truly was. 

  For anyone who may wonder if I am an alcoholic- I‚Äôd say that I am not. I do drink. I have had weeks/months in my life of drinking more than I should have. But throughout my life- I‚Äôve had times that weeks went by without drinking a single alcoholic beverage. I enjoy drinking, but I also enjoy spending time with God and my children, and reading, and shopping, and many other things that do not include drinking. 

Since dating again, I find it incredibly hard to know what a healthy amount of drinking looks like. It worries me now, with dating, that I am being too rigid..... or on the flip side that I date someone who is an alcoholic, unbeknownst to me.    Please help me to understand how to differentiate",9

I‚Äôve been trying keep it out of my life (most recently as of three days ago) due to a pain in my upper right chest and also other things like random pains in my toe and arm and lots of gastronomical rumbling that I have read could be due to liver disease. 

I still smoke my juul pretty regularly tho and smoke weed pretty often too. I have quit drinking for about a week recently while continuing to smoke and the pain in my chest did subside. 

I‚Äôm 3 days in now and the pain and gastronomical issues have not subsided yet. 

My question is how does smoking nicotine and thc effect your liver compared to alcohol? Or do they effect your respiratory system more? Or will I continue to damage my liver further by smoking?",1

As the title says I am having a hard time with my partner giving me space after I relapsed (I was sober for 2 years). It was a bad relapse and I know I hurt her and have been trying to make it up to her by being transparent and doing everything she requests me to do like not being able to go out without her. I do get she is worried and is only trying to protect me and herself. I feel like I am trapped and am starting to get frustrated and bitter because she won‚Äôt give me the chance to just be by myself or go anywhere by myself. I also understand I really hurt her but is this a reasonable request at this point? It‚Äôs been a month since I quit. Am I wrong or is she going over the top at this point? I am still working on myself, doing AA and seeing a psychologist so it‚Äôs not like I am doing nothing to help with my addiction.

I've been battling a lot of personal demons lately and for the last 4 weeks I've been drinking everyday which is not usual for me.  I would usually drink maybe once or twice a month but now I find myself drinking everyday.  Not necessarily getting drunk but definitely getting a bit tipsy or just a few.  I've even started getting into the hard stuff again lately which I haven't drank in years.

The reason I ask this is because of today.  I really wanted a beer today, more so than I ever have before.  When I was walking down to the beer store (I live in Ontario, Canada) I started getting nervous that it would be closed and was relieved it was open.  Deep down I knew this wasn't right and sitting here now and typing this out I know it isn't right.

Am I becoming an alcoholic?  I feel the need to drink now to make myself not think of shit but the drinking makes it worse.  I love drinking beer (and not because it gets me drunk...I really do like beer) but now I'm wondering if this is the beginning stages of alcoholism as I'm not familiar with it.",3

I came to terms with this years ago. My family has tried to help him seek help and show him how much of a problem it is, but all he does is acknowledge it and then continue drinking. I thought he‚Äôd understand how much of a problem it is after several emergency trips he has taken to the hospital, but all he does is blame it on ‚Äúold age‚Äù when that is obviously not the case. I tried so hard to help him, to show him how much it‚Äôs affecting not just us, but our relationships with our family. We now no longer see almost all of our family members on our dad‚Äôs side for reasons I have yet to understand to this day since my parents haven‚Äôt really told us the issue since my sister and I were kids.

2021-05-30 13:48:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/noge93/today_marks_4_months/,Today marks 4 months!,"Today marks 4 months of sobriety. 4months ago I decided to stop any substance abuse I was inflicting myself; primarily Alcohol but also cut cold turkey on weed.

It's been a bumpy ride but I have been learning to accept, let go, forgive and repent. 4 essential things that have taught me to face myself. Letting feelings I had repressed through alcohol or ignore through smoking weed, was very confrontational and made me realise how my emotions were directed in all the wrong directions. My impatience, arrogance and neglect of others was deeply rooted in resentments I had towards people in my past, which the ones in my present had to suffer for. I didn't know how to channel my anger, not realising it came from a place of fear, into the right direction. 

I feel much lighter emotionally. Not drinking wasn't the solution, but sure as hell helped me give the energy and focus to direct my thoughts in the right direction.

I spend far to long expressing frustrations and wanting to passively aggressively let the world know how wrong they were about things. Truth is, I had to learn that it was none of my business what other people thought or believed in. My insecurities pushed me into thinking that I needed to be in control of everything and everyone around me. 

I no longer wake up with an anxiety of the unknown and the fear of not remembering who I hurt the day prior to my binge drinking. The constant numbing of my emotions making me seem cold and distant. At times I just didn't want to feel responsible for the pain I was causing and a vicious cycle of numbing myself was the easiest way to ignore my wrong doings. 

I can say that today, 4 months into my sobriety, I am proud of myself and the direction i'm heading. I feel much more in-tune with my defects and resentments. Days are far from perfect but I am so grateful for the people that supported me along the way. I have a wonderful family that despite all the pain I caused has stood by me. My mom and my dad have been amazing the past years and I love them so much for all the blessings they have given me. My siblings, despite missing them dearly, have given me the strength and resilience to not give up. My friends checking up on me are truly the heart beat of what makes all of this even more worth it! Last and far from least, Deni, My beauty, my strength, my weakness and my life; you are the one that's seen the ugly up close and stuck by me no matter what! You have shown me that love can be unconditional and given me the hope I needed to carry on in the right direction! Thank you my love for being all that you are and I can't wait to keep discovering each other in the infinite variables life has to offer. 

I have been given a gift and I intend to embrace it fully! Thank you and i'm grateful for anyone that has read this! One day at a time! <3",10

Is he an alcoholic? If so, how do I explain my POV to him?

&#x200B;

*Background: This feels like a ""yeah duh"" post to me, but I do need it confirmed, so thank you. I (M31), bro (M29), and mom live together. Every living blood relative over 22 on my dad's side has struggled with alcoholism but one. Nobody has on my mom's side. I am more like my mom's side in general, never have had that struggle in specific, and I don't feel like I ever will (probably famous last words but w/e). My brother is more like my dad's side.*

*He's always drank a fair amount but I saw no real problem until it peaked in COVID, when his job became WFH with a CRUSHINGLY stressful duties shift. Like 3 people should have been doing his job. His drinking took a heavy upturn. He consistently drank during work, and specified on numerous occasions that he needed it to cope with work, and that was why he was drinking so much. That work ended in December, and his drinking has increased if anything. He has not applied for any jobs between then and now, although has been purporting to want to for a while. For perspective, last weekend, he bought a 5th and drank all but an inch of it as well as about two bottles of wine in <48 hrs.*

&#x200B;

So! Today we were talking about his breakup. We left a drinking event with his partner on Thurs and they got into a political argument where he went way too far (his words). He said he thinks they're done now for prior reasons. He said that he gets it, he's jobless, depressed, a ""trainwreck,"" and ""struggling with alcoholism."" I believe he also called himself an alcoholic (but he now says he never said that). Not clear if he still admits ""struggling with alcoholism"" or if so, how that differs from ""alcoholic.""

This led to a conv about his alcohol use. He was already drunk but fairly coherent, which gave me pause, but I saw the opening, and we're only ever alone at night, when he is generally drunk. I have been looking for a non-drunk opening for a month and haven't found one. As my little brother, he can never do anything I say, so I was very careful to never say >>>I<<< thought he was an alcoholic or tell him anything he should do, just walk through his struggles with alcohol with him, and talk about what he wanted to do if anything. A mindfulness approach.

This was great at first, and we both learned a lot. I introduced with ""so I noticed you said you were an alcoholic, never heard you use that term before, what changed?"" He seemed to accept the term but didn't address it, which I mentioned again later to same reception. He said it goes back 4 years, actually. He talked about how he was definitely ""self-medicating,"" because he struggles with a lot of negative feelings, and alcohol helps with that.

The conv turned when he asked what I think alcoholism is. I said from what I've seen, the community generally seems to define it by two metrics: the person isn't in control of their use, and their use is replacing things (work, errands, self-medication, social crutch etc.). Correct me if I'm off-base. He said it's whether it's harming people. I said does that include himself. He said no, but seemed to consider it. So I moved back to learning about his experiences, but he kept bringing it back to his harming people definition. I was very clear to say I don't think that's a productive direction because I felt like I was just listing crap to blame him for when I preferred to hear his story, and he said ""well \*I\* want to hear it, because I don't want to harm people.""

What ensued was me listing the ways that occurred to me that he had harmed people. He denied most of them, and denied that the ones he admitted to constituted a problem. I really should have refused to list them since this was foreseeable.He got really combative and said I was judging him (I reminded him that he was the one who compelled me to list it all, didn't matter). I repeated that I wasn't demanding or calling for anything, and said I'm just happy to do whatever you want to do about your alcoholism, and made some suggestions for changes around the house. He shot them all down. I said, so what do you want to do, and he said ""nothing,"" he trusts his own ""willpower,"" and said he is happy with the way his life is proceeding. I said ""I'm confused.... but you said you were an alcoholic,"" and said normally saying that indicates you want to change (...to not-alcoholic). He said he never said he was an alcoholic. Then I said, okay I guess that's that.

I said this is no longer productive since he seemed to feel attacked and sought to end the conv, and he said not attacked, judged. I said sure, end for that. He kept on bringing up my judgement and asking me to explain his harm to other people, and I said ""I mean I don't know what else to say, I told you the harm, and you disagree, and there's nothing much left to talk about."" At this point he started to get a little incoherent. He persisted with these weird ""aha"" moments that seemed to prove I was demanding he quit and I was the one who called him an alcoholic, but made no logical sense. I kept saying let's wrap it up since you feel judged, and he asserted that he never said he felt judged and that I was making that up, and it was just me who was uncomfortable and bailing on the conversation. And then I wrote this post!

Here is the list of harms I gave him (obv there are more):

* He has passed out for hours with the oven on twice now. Last November, my mom found him and he cussed her out for bothering him when she woke him up. He burned pies we needed for Thanksgiving. Earlier this month, I found him with the oven door also open, and could not wake him up no matter how hard I tried. Not like coma, just undefeatable sleep. Today, he admitted both but focused on denying that the oven was on the 2nd time, as if that f\*\*\*ing matters, and as if he was even ""there"" for it.
* He no longer does \~80% of his dishes. I told him that last time I brought that up he totally denied it then said actually \*I\* am the one who does no dishes. Ask my past roommates‚ÄîI do my dishes. I frankly cannot be gaslit on this. Today, he admitted he struggles to do dishes but relitigated the rest of that argument. I said why the hell are we even talking about my dishes in a conv about dishes re: your alcohol. No dice.
* During a visit to my aunt, aunt and mom asked him not to cuss at the dinner table, and I, who honestly believe people should cuss freely, agreed he should stop if they wanted him to. He started shouting cuss words and making dinner miserable for the next 15 minutes. Today he doubled down.
* A day or two later he drank enough that he passed out with an open beer can on his stomach. This isn't directly harmful, but is a burden to do in someone else's house surrounded by sober people, makes everyone worry about you, he could've spilled on her couch, indicates a lack of self control, is embarrassing for my mom, etc. Today, he insisted nobody was harmed and there was no problem.
* My bff and I played a game of rage cage with him, and he would not take no for an answer when we wanted to stop. We tried to leave and he grabbed my friend around the neck and wouldn't let him go. It was in a really awkward location in the garage doorway, and they almost knocked a humongous shelf full of heavy objects over on themselves. I extricated bff, and bro latched onto me instead, and I submitted him with an ankle lock. When told about it the next day he was ashamed and sorry. Today he still fully admits that was wack.
   * Notes‚Äîthis is not as bad as it sounds: This is in the range of things we would do sober too, and we were all laughing, but given the context it was clearly not consensual. I asked my friend later and he confirmed that he did want it to stop and couldn't. My bro and I also specifically have a longstanding semi-yearly impromptu jiu jitsu throwdown, ending by submission. So this is all partly normal, just not like this.
* He takes arguments too far and too personally while drunk on the reg (like with his ex, and... this argument)

So. Sound like an alcoholic, or am I overreacting? If yes, how do I explain my POV that these things are harmful to others, and explain why alcoholism is more than ""harmful to others"" anyway? I don't mean **convince** (I'm not super hopeful about that) I mean explain. May show this to him, so please be thoughtful.",19

I (32M) have been struggling with my drinking for a long time and it‚Äôs only become worse in recent months. With the stress of work and my daily anxiety struggles, I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of drinking every day. Every day at work, I have a drink waiting for me in the car for the drive home... on the days I forget, I leave work to go to the local liquor store before they close. I get home and I drink more. On the weekends, I start drinking by the afternoon. I‚Äôm not proud of what I‚Äôve become.

I‚Äôve tried AA twice in the past, but it never felt right, not only in the religious angles but mostly with the idea that we‚Äôre ‚Äúpowerless‚Äù against this struggle. It comes off like the people are blaming their struggle on something else... not a fan.

What habits have any of you used to curb the kind of habits I have? With Covid restrictions lifting, I‚Äôd like to start going back to the gym to release stress positively, but I currently work until around 11pm and no gyms around me have returned to 24/7 operating hours. I‚Äôve tried exercising at home, but it‚Äôs a struggle to maintain a drive when I‚Äôm merely feet away from the couch or my bed.

Has been a week since I last had a drink, and I'd not drunk for a week before that. I thought I'd start feeling better now that I'm not waking up hungover most mornings but honestly I just feel more depressed. 

I had a close family member die recently, broke up with my girlfriend, have to find a new place to live and have a frustrating job that bores me to tears. With all that on my plate I'm not really expecting to feel on the top of the world but all that felt easier to manage when I was drinking.

I have hobbies, lots of friends I chat to and a supportive family, plus I am talking to a professional about my alcohol misuse and will start attending SMART Recovery group sessions and phone therapy for depression soon. I feel like I'm doing all the right things and have a good support network to help me get over this but I just feel empty inside, there's no joy. It feels like I'm doing this because I know I should logically but it's making me feel worse emotionally. 

It's fucked up that I don't know how to relax and be happy without alcohol or a drug making me feel that way. It's the way I've been dealing with things since I was a teenager, I'm nearly 30 now. I know the only way that I'll learn how is by going sober and sticking too it for a long time. It's just this transitionary phase that's screwing with me. 

Feels like I'm in a tunnel and I can't see any light at the end. I'm constantly thinking about drinking or doing another drug to the point I'm struggling to concentrate on anything else. My addiction feels like a cat scratching at the door trying to get in during every waking moment and my willingness to keep that door closed is wearing very thin.

I've picked up vaping again for the first time in months and have been taking small amounts of codeine (16-24mg) in the evening to help me relax and sleep. I suspect this is probably making things worse rather than better but I'm just so scared of going completely straight edge.

I suspect I'm not alone in this and that lots of other people feel or felt the same way. I guess I just wanted to share and get this off my chest with people who would understand. 

Does it get easier?",1

I'm not sure if this is the best space to ask but I'm a bit lost. Off this isn't the right place, please let me know where else I can get help....

I want to be a supportive partner so right maybe I'd ask here about how to approach the subject so he didn't get defensive. 

Can anyone help? Here's the background:

I've noticed recently that my husband has been indulging more often. We used to have a drink on the weekends, at bbqs, etc but recently it's much more frequent. 
I can't help but think he's using it as a crutch as he's been struggling with depression, anxiety and repeated failed attempts to find a new job (he's underemployed right now.)

This week, I noticed a change on his bank card (I was doing the bills) for the liquor store on a day we didn't go. At least, not that I remember. It's been a crazy week so I thought maybe I got my days mixed up and just brushed it off as best I could but it was bugging me.  He didn't leave any bottles and the only thing I could put together was that he was acting off on Tuesday. Not drunk, just a bit ""extra"". To the point I found him annoying (something I don't usually feel towards him) and it reminded me off when he's had too much wine. 

Tonight, I was (again) on the banking app sorting through something and saw that the liquor store charge was for more than I expected. For background: I knew he was going and he told me what he purchased bc we were going to my parents after work and we were bringing drinks.

From what I can tell, the charge should have been for about $50 for it was 85. 

I'm going to resort to morning too discuss with him and make sure I didn't miss anything but, if I don't, is like to find a way to talk with him about what's going on.

My question is: how do I even start? If I start by bringing up the charges at the store and the mystery trip, he will definitely get defensive. At the same time, on don't want to trap him. 
What do I do here? I'm so sad and lost...",5

2021-05-27 06:42:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/nm4mlr/unsure_if_im_experiencing_withdrawal_48_hours_out/,Unsure if I'm experiencing withdrawal (48 hours out since last drink),"I should say from the start that I've recently withdrawn from both kratom and phenibut recently and have used other substances such as baclofen and pregabalin to help with those. Did both those withdrawals at the same time after dropping them at the same time another time not long ago. So I've had 4 notable withdrawal experiences this past year, and also some issues discontinuing the baclofen. But now I'm off all that, confused what's PAWS from what and why I feel the what I do at times. I do still take the pregabalin still at 150 mg 2x a day for nerve pain.

I picked up drinking heavily as a replacement for my other addictions, continued to fill what's missing in my life with another substance. And yeah, life being a bitch, like a real fucking bitch. Anyway, I thought I was in too deep at a certain point and had just assumed I was dependent on alcohol because having a drink would bring me back and seem to alleviate any discomforts/etc. And after my recent experiences with withdrawals, I kept drinking, thinking I needed it. Was drinking anywhere from 4-16 drinks every day (average being somewhere in the middle there) for 4 months. I took a one month break in January after another stint before that that lasted around 4 months as well. I started drinking upon waking up every morning, thinking it was just what my body expected at a certain point and it was like taking medicine essentially. Drinking anything really; gin, vodka, rum, beer, hard seltzer, kombucha, little bottles of wine, whatever did the trick for any given day. I moved into a new place with a liquor store right outside my door. I've gained literally 50 pounds since moving in, going from possibly the best shape in my life to the worst in just over half a year. The times I've cleared out my car or wherever I was hiding all my empties seemed to be no-shit tell-tale signs that I had truly become alcoholic, and I accepted it, taking care of my other addictions first, knowing I'd get to dropping this alcohol habit eventually.

But here I am, 48 hours out since my last drink, feeling alright. I didn't even taper or anything. I had 13 drinks my last night. I was just trying to test and see how my body would respond without alcohol, and I decided to ride it out. I've only had a touch of anxiety here and there, brain fog, bit of blurry vision, some fatigue, and depression. Thing is, that stuff's all pretty much been the norm for me this past year. Those are the side effects I've been dealing with damn near every day because of dropping or tapering off the kratom and phenibut. So it's hard to tell really. I don't know if I'm feeling some minor withdrawal symptoms or if it's mostly PAWS from other substances. Why am I not having much of a withdrawal? Could it suddenly hit me tomorrow? I'm glad I'm alright for the time-being, but I am a bit confused about what's going on with my body and mind. I suspect the pregablin may just be masking things. But was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on my situation, being as complex as its? Thanks for reading if you took the time.

TLDR: 48 hours out from ending a pretty heavy 4-month bender, not sure if I'm in withdrawal or if more is to come. Experienced both kratom and phenibut withdrawal recently and could be having PAWS from both. I take 150 mg of pregabalin 2x a day.",3

2021-05-27 01:49:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/nm0pm7/how_do_i_get_my_mom_help_really_long_im_sorry/,"How do I get my mom help? (Really long, I'm sorry)","Tonight was the first night she got physical with me while drunk. She didn't hit or anything, but she grabbed my shoulders really hard and violently shook me. When I told her she was hurting me, she took her pointer fingers and began jabbing my chest and when she stopped she put her face against mine and yelled, then shoved me further into the couch (I was sitting). I checked after she went back into her room, and took pictures of the red marks where she grabbed and jabbed me. 

Usually, she just gets horrifically mean and says things like I (and my siblings) make her hate her life, and she told me she wanted to go go drunk driving on purpose in hopes of dying because of me. She called my siblings (fucking/stupid) bitches and (little/stupid) fuckers (they are 13 and 10), and yelled at one of them to the point where I felt I had to take them both away to my cousin's house for the night. 

If this information helps any, she rarely goes a day without drinking anything. Normally she'll stay in her bathroom (bedroom and bathroom door locked) and smoke cigarettes and drink. She can, and has on many occasions, drink 2 bottles of red wine and a 6 pack of Corona Premier. If she has more available to her she'll go for that too. If she runs out she'll scour for more, or try to get someone to bring some to her. For example, one time she finished off the wine and resorted to straight vodka. She ended up passing out that night and I had to get her to bed. This was the first of a few times I've had to do this. 

I have tried talking to her before about her drinking, and I'm met with one of two responses. The better one is ""I'll try to do better."" She usually does better for at most a week, before something happens and she completely falls back into drinking. The not so great response, is her turning against me and telling me that I (and, again, my siblings) are the reason she drinks and I can't judge her or shame her for her only escape from the ""hell that is [her] life."" 

Other people have tried to talk to her as well, but she always deflects. One time she told my cousin ""You're just trying to kill my vibe"" and walked away from her as she tried to talk more about it. 

I know she needs help, but I don't know how to get her help in 1) a way that won't cause any legal complications with her custody of my siblings (13, 10, and 2) and 2) a way that she will actually want help. I read an article saying that research shows people forced into rehab don't stay recovered, and that sometimes it will make it worse. 

All my siblings' dads are in their lives and share custody with my mom. I want to tell them about this, in a more serious and in depth manner than I have before, but if she finds out she will tell them I am exaggerating, and then I will be faced with her wrath afterwards. I'm 19, so I'm not sure if that means I can do anything more than just tell her ""you should go to therapy."" I have before, without mentioning drinking, and she told me that because of us (her children) she has neither the time nor money to do so. 

I'd rather not get any authorities involved because, again, the legal custody issues it may cause. She also has a bad history with the police (she and my siblings' dads would sometimes get physical when she became drunk). 

It feels like a lost cause, but my siblings never really got her as a mother, at least that they can remember, and I want them to have her as I had her when I was a kid. The mom that would read me stories and play in the yard with me and sing me to sleep and sit on the couch with the family and help us pick out a movie to watch, and fall asleep halfway through, but wake up when it was over and tell us it was a good one. I miss her, and I can't even imagine what it's like to not have had her at all. 

I just don't know how to help her when she doesn't want it, and doesn't even seem to think she needs it. Is there even a way for me to get her help?",3

I'll preface what I'm about to say with this - I'm extremely anxious and incredibly depressed at the moment. I had a break up and once the depression hit me, my symptoms seem to have gotten so bad. Im achey in my shoulders and my arms often. I feel sick. I feel stressed, and I struggle to sleep or relax without booze but I have a feeling of impending doom and feel like I'm going to die. The aches I can put down to bad posture (I've been working from home hunched over a laptop for over a year). I get so stressed that my chest feels incredibly heavy and I get paranoid about my heart.

I'm so worried my family are going to find me dead. I'm trying to cut down on the booze and have relative success, but I've become the guy who drinks a lot to my friends. I'm a shell of my former self and I'm so scared. I feel like I'm at rock bottom honestly.

Sober 7 months.,"Hello people...iv never posted anything on a forum and I'm not usually someone who even gets on and reads em buuut I had to do this for myself.

I'm 26 years old and until about 7 months ago, I had been drinking almost everyday for 9 years.

Specifically after my Dad died in 2015..I took a turn for the worst and quickly advanced to drinking about a gallon of vodka a day.

That was when I could afford it and when i couldn't afford it..then I would withdrawl in full blown alcoholic DT's until I got a bit of alcohol again. (Very dangerous- known to cause seizures and death)

This ddnt change even after I developed pancreatitis and started killing my liver, resulting in 5 days near death in the ICU.

The thing that changed my mind about killing myself with alcohol was the fact that my Mother and Little Brother came to me and told me that they were preparing to come home and find me dead one day and that they would be devastated but not surprised.

I could not do this to them, and as shitty as it is to say..I cared less about my own health then the thought of putting my family through that soooo here I am...7 months later, sober as ever, loving every bit of the new person I am, loving life, and never going back to the alcohol.

I just wanted to tell people about my sobriety as it is something I hold so dear to my heart...so thanks for reading.

If someone is having issues like I had and think I could help..please reach out to me...I know in my heart, mind, and soul I'm sober forever so I want to start getting my experience out and hope that it possibly helps someone else confront their own addiction issues.",218

He has never been able to hold his drink and doesn‚Äôt know when to stop. When we were younger and both (but mainly him) went out drinking fairly heavily more regularly there were a few incidents that we got past with me being angry but never really questioning that we would remain in the relationship. The worst incidents were one occasion when he slapped me around the face as we were leaving a music festival after drinking all day. The police were there and asked if I wanted to press charges but I said no. The other occasion was when he came home the night before one of my final university exams and started throwing things about and ripping up my revision papers. I had to call his mum and go to stay at her house for the night. Both times he apologised and he has not been aggressive in the least while drunk for at least 4 years. He also used to do things that were more annoying than agressive such as repeatedly ringing me while I‚Äôm asleep to ask for a lift home and would be barely comprehensible due to slurring, or being sick everywhere when he got home but that has all stopped too.


To the contrary, he is overly talkative and sappy while drunk now but also a bit of a bumbling mess and lately through lockdown his drinking has gotten more regular as he‚Äôs been drinking in the evening at home most days. Other than the mere fact of being drunk and annoying he has not done anything particularly bad in a long time, but I find myself constantly on edge when he‚Äôs been drinking or if I know he‚Äôs out and going to be drinking. I find myself wishing he would go back to hotel and I don‚Äôt ever want to be around him when he‚Äôs drunk. I feel like this is a reaction to everything that happened in the past but I‚Äôm seriously considering the future of the relationship. It just feels strange to be thinking of leaving someone for something that happened over 4 years ago and that I readily forgave without even much grovelling at the time. 

For context I‚Äôm always telling him I don‚Äôt like his drinking and he recently admitted that he knows he relies on drinking too much as a crutch for his emotions but I don‚Äôt think he is fully aware of what I‚Äôm feeling, and I think he would be extremely surprised if I said I was leaving him for this. Although he‚Äôs acknowledged this, he hasn‚Äôt made any moves to curb the drinking.

Has anyone else felt this way so long after the fact? Has anyone actually left an alcoholic partner so long after any actual incidents? I honestly feel stupid that I wasn‚Äôt more angry at the time as these were clearly instances of abuse but I suppose I was younger and we were still in the honeymoon stage.",4

Hopefully it‚Äôs ok to post here. I‚Äôm a member of Al Anon, but looking for some perspective from the other side. My husband is an active alcoholic, but won‚Äôt accept it. Drinks until he passes out on the couch, hides alcohol, etc. No legal issues yet, but we fight about the drinking often. This week he decided to apply for a job five hours away from me and our 9 month old son. He says if I‚Äôm going to leave him for his drinking, he might as well move far away and get a job he loves. I told him not to wait to get hired - please leave today and don‚Äôt come back. He packed a bag and left.
My sponsor says this is pretty typical alcoholic behavior. In my head I see this going one of two ways: He either realizes he has a drinking problem and gets sober to keep his family, or he leaves for this new job and I raise our son alone. I‚Äôm finally getting to a place where I can visualize being a single mom and being okay. I guess I‚Äôm looking for some validation that I made the right decision in kicking him out? Maybe I did, maybe I didn‚Äôt... this has been a long time coming. For those of you working on your sobriety: you have my utmost respect.",2

Hopeful Story.,"I (30F) have been binge drinking since I was 13. I was always that girl that would act sober but be like 8 drinks deep and I couldn't understand why everyone acted so immature. Alcohol is an emotional pain reliever for me but apparently in return I receive  physical pain from booze. 

Ever since I turned 26 alcohol seemed to have more adverse effects on me especially during my ""hangovers"" which were more like just a constant state of dehydration, diarrhea, blurry vision, and feeling like I needed to eat something to absorb all the acidity in my stomach, bloatedness....you get the picture. My ""hangovers"" were just something I learned to live with because I had to get on with my live and work but once I turned 29 alcohol really started to catch up with me. I could no longer control the amount of hard liquor I drank and it was financially irresponsible. On top of this I began to throw up bile in the mornings, have IBS symptoms (horrific!), got a rash/inflammation around my mouth that looked crazy, and gastritis symptoms, couldn't even look at coffee without wanting to get sick. I couldn't take the physical pain of constantly being sick anymore and what I was doing to my body weighed heavily on conscious. I drank all day, everyday. Pretty much couldn't get out of bed without it.

The 20th was my last drink and I hate the withdrawals but I'm feeling ok now. I'm in school so it was hard but I think I timed it right. My advice is to try to sleep as much as you can and I used different medications but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to list them here (no medical advice rule) but I wouldn't have gotten through my w/d without my medications. I just wanted to stop by and say that if I can do it (with booze I have zero will power) than ANYONE OF YOU can do it as long as you WANT to. I simply wanted to because of how physically ill it was making me. I know if I take one drink I will have to repeat this process of being so sick and it's almost like a food poisoning sick so I will try to keep that fresh in my mind so I do not relapse.

I don't want to get all preachy because only you know when the time is right to quit but since I stopped drinking on the 20th I can feel my body healing itself. The crazy rash and inflammation around my mouth is completely gone and all I crave is water whereas I used to hate drinking water.",11

2021-05-24 03:33:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/njs99o/my_mother_passed_and_i_feel_guilty_for_not_doing/,My mother passed and I feel guilty for not doing more,"A few days ago, it was the one-year anniversary since my mother passed from complications regarding alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis).

Her addiction was present since I could remember. It was a tough environment to grow up in, as there were scary moments I had experienced when I was younger. Even today (28 yo), I have anxiety that I attribute in part to living in an abusive household and an environment where neither parent was reliable. As I became of age, got my education, and began to establish my own autonomy, I found myself putting up walls and emotionally separating myself from my parents. Neither one had ever honestly acknowledged the issues I endured as a kid, and I developed resentment over the years because of it. As I got older, however, I realized that (to an extent) all members of my family have been a victim of sorts. You expect your parents to be the best leaders they can be, but we're all flawed individuals and nobody is perfect.

Over the years, my mother's illness had taken its toll and she began exhibiting more obvious signs and symptoms of serious illness. She would never want to see a physician, as she was in perpetual denial of the extent of her illness (or near the end I expect a bit hopeless). Nevertheless, I ended up taking her to the hospital several times in the last couple years of her life. Despite my best efforts over the years, I could not convince her to seek treatment for her alcoholism or follow up with a physician. After a while, it felt like there was no combination of words in the dictionary I could conjure up nor actions I could take that would change her mind. Near the end, I began to feel hopeless.

Despite all of the negativity that clouded my relationship with my mother, she had an inner strength and love for me and my sibling that was obvious. I know, deep down, that she tried her best to battle her vices and be there for me to the best of her ability. Overall, her addiction hid what was otherwise an intelligent, beautiful, loving person.

Unfortunately, her death was rather sudden and I did not have much of an opportunity to say goodbye. I had always hoped that one day, I would have made amends with her over the baggage we've carried and we could make peace in the final years of her life. I don't feel like I have closure, but rather a wound that has only worsened. I wish I could go back in time and tell her that everything is okay and I love her very much. There's a heck of a lot more that I'd like to have done, but at least that would've helped. 

To anyone that has been struggling with alcoholism, know that you are worthy of love and support. No matter what friends/family may or may not have expressed to you over the years, my hope and belief is they love you tremendously and want to see you live a happy and healthy life. It's never too late to improve things and strengthen the relationships you have with your loved ones. 

I love you mom.",17

Why?
Why did you drink again when you knew it would kill you?
Why did you just give up on yourself?
Why did you feel like you weren‚Äôt worthy of sobriety? 
Why did you leave rehab all of those times?
Why wasn‚Äôt I enough for you to stay sober? 
Why did you leave me here alone? 
Why am I left to continue on without you here? 

these are the questions your children will ask themselves if you allow alcohol to take you from them. i wrote all of these with tears streaming down my face. these questions are something i ask myself on the daily. another night without my dad because of alcohol. i miss him so much. it doesn‚Äôt get easier. today is two months without him and i would give anything to hug him again. my heart is forever broken in half, but your kids don‚Äôt have to feel how i do. please, stay sober. even when things get hard, keep fighting. all i want is for my dad‚Äôs story and my pain of grieving him to help someone. i pray this post helped at least somebody tonight. i‚Äôm rooting so hard for all of you here.",19

I am a functional alcoholic‚Ä¶ Gruesomely so.. I sicken of hearing people in every day talk mention how much they drink, and joke about their livers and shit‚Ä¶

Over the last 11 years I have less than 200 days of no drinking. In the last 4 years I am up to 18-20 airplane shooters of vodka and a few beers a day.

I am dying.. But I am functional. Nobody knew, but they are starting to know.. It is getting harder to hide the extremity of my addiction.. But everyone I love seems to ignore it... I wish I wasn‚Äôt functional. I wish somebody would give me an intervention. I wish somebody knew that I am literally dying. I am too scared to go to a doctor, but I am dead already.

I don‚Äôt want to die an alcoholic, I can‚Äôt go to friends or family. I briefly brought it up to my father once in a roll of tears many years ago before it was extreme. He said ‚ÄúI hope it doesn‚Äôt end up like your aunt‚Äù. He is not a bad guy. He just doesn‚Äôt understand he is old school. My aunt is an alcoholic. It isn‚Äôt good. This is my fault in his head. This was my choice.

Nobody understands addiction. Like I am the asshole? Maybe I am. Maybe I have been wrong this entire time. Maybe crying myself into a bottle every night is some sick inner desire. My dad is a smart man. Literally genius IQ. I could be the fucker here.

But either way I can‚Äôt do it alone. And I am alone. I am such a goddamn piece of shit drunk and I am alone and I am scared and I don‚Äôt have anyone to reach out to and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I have the most decent job a world record alcoholic could have, but still a shitty life. My insurance covers some treatments, but I can‚Äôt go to rehab they will fire me. Plus then I have to expose myself as a drunk. I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of money anyway. But now my health is failing and I can‚Äôt hide it from my perceived world any longer.

Does anyone have any advice on rehab?? How does one go into rehab without fucking up their entire existing life?

TLDR: I am 30 years old and I drank my life away, one tear at a time.

I need some advice but i kind of know what the answer is going to be. I guess I need to hear some outside opinions before actually telling her.

Anyway, Ive had quite a severe alcohol problem and have been drinking 2-3 bottle of 14% wine every night since 2011/12 (i cant remember exactly). I was sober for 9 months until a few months ago but now im back to square one drinking every day.

Weve been together for 7months and I feel like she deserves to know the truth. Im just scared its going to push her away and i dont want to lose her. which is stupid because i know the alcohol will ruin things eventually anyway.

My alcoholism got much worse during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic I was a high-functioning alcoholic, which went hand-in-hand with my workaholism. The pandemic, its myriad and compounding emotional issues, and unemployment caused me to spiral way the hell down in depression, which led to drinking more. I was a 5‚Äô6, 130-pound woman ‚Äî I gained 40 pounds between March and November of 2020 largely due to the copious bottles of wine I drank (... also an SSRI‚Äôs side effects, but anyway). I‚Äôd drink four or five a week most weeks, blackout drunk twice a week. 

The things that got to me weren‚Äôt, regrettably, how much it was impacting my primary relationship and my friendships. Of course those things bothered me and I didn‚Äôt want to be negatively impacting them, but I just kept drinking anyway and then would be drunk AND guilt-wracked. No, it was the gastro issues and the weight gain that finally made me crack. 

I thought it would be much harder to quit drinking. Granted, it‚Äôs not easy; and more to the point, I will still have a glass of wine extremely infrequently or during especially bad weeks ‚Äî hence why I‚Äôve cut booze by 90% and not 100%. So I still feel like a failure. Here I am finally able to moderate my drinking (I‚Äôd say I average 3-4 glasses of wine a month now, instead of 20 bottles a month) when all I wanted to do was completely stop it. 

I feel like both a poser and a failure. Here I wasn‚Äôt drinking as much as other alcoholics in the first place, yet I‚Äôm supposed to be proud when I managed to basically just ‚Äúdrink less‚Äù?? 

I don‚Äôt even feel much better, either. I‚Äôm sure the weight will continue to come off slowly, but I was hoping my sleep bruxism, my insomnia, and my perpetual tiredness would improve a little bit. Hell, I might even be more depressed 4 months later than I was before moderating my behavior.

However, I am very, very happy for my partner. He is so much happier now that I‚Äôm not drunk ever, and I know he feels our relationship has gotten better for it. I don‚Äôt regret severely reducing my drinking. I guess I just don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a big deal or ‚Äúcool‚Äù/praiseworthy, and am experiencing some cognitive dissonance over it. I feel like I‚Äôm getting a pile of cookies for not deliberately shitting myself in public.

Now that restrictions are loosening and I am vaxxed, I was thinking of drinking when I am out in social situations again. I haven‚Äôt really BEEN to any (except two these last two days, where I had a glass of wine each time) in over a year, and I‚Äôve already found myself anxious and depressed about it instead of happy about seeing friends again ‚Äî I feel insanely ‚Äúout of practice‚Äù being around people, to the point I was freezing up and internally sweating for most of one of these two events. I know booze will make those situations easier for me; I don‚Äôt want to go back to drinking a lot or getting drunk. And frankly, every social circumstance I am like to be in will involve booze in some way. But some big shit happened with my brother very recently (that I‚Äôm writing another post about lol ‚Äî his marriage might fall apart due to his drinking) that is making me reconsider drinking socially again, which in turn makes me even more depressed.

I dunno! I don‚Äôt regret reducing my drinking‚Äî I certainly got much farther than I expected to. I guess I just wish it had improved more than it did so far, and it‚Äôs still hard to recognize that it HAS improved stuff.

I am the female is this narrative.

I know my drinking is a problem and I need to get my act together. 

I drink out of habit, not craving.

My anxiety peaks at 3am as I wonder what the hell I did/said and if I‚Äôve embarrassed myself or my  SO. I (often we) drink (to blackout) every night, and know when to stop and take myself to bed.

Every morning I resolve to not that I‚Äôm not going to drink today but by the time the late afternoon rolls around my intention blows out the window. 

Before you suggest going to AA, I‚Äôve done some research and I just can‚Äôt get into the ‚Äòhigher being/power‚Äô side of things. I guess the point of this post is that I just need to tell someone as a way to punish myself.

My SO never gets angry (he drinks too so we are enablers for each other) and we laugh it all off in the morning but I am still embarrassed and ashamed that I drink too much.

I‚Äôve downloaded an alcohol tracker app but can‚Äôt seem to get past day one. I know that changing the habit is the first step but don‚Äôt know what to replace it with. I have no friends, not one. We are in the process moving and I have this wild idea of joining some social groups but my (diagnosed) social anxiety disorder makes it hard. 

I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äònever drink again‚Äô I just want to take control of myself.

We have around 5 bottles in the house so I guess the first step is to make them gone so I resolve that once these bottles are gone I‚Äôll give up (I‚Äôm sure you know how *that* plays out).

Part of me wants to tell my SO that I‚Äôm struggling but am ashamed that it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I need help.

Not sure why I‚Äôm telling you this, maybe there is someone out there who can relate and give me the benefit of their experience.

I am 1200km‚Äôs away from my psychiatrist but my sessions are done online. Part of me wants to go into hospital/rehab but don‚Äôt know where to start.

I thought that was enough to get me to stop for good. Then I checked into an outpatient program and started cheating just weeks in. That grew to the point that I had to quit the program a week before I should have graduated because I blew all my chances and then some. Thought going back to work would help keep me busy but on my fifth day back i bought a liter of chardonnay and drank it all over the course of my shift. The next work day, same thing only i added two shots of rum. No idea how i managed to get through that shift without being called on it but people were sure to notice. Spent the next two days off so hungover i could barely eat or move but still putting away a bottle or two of wine. Something about this relapse scared me in a way nothing has before. I cannot moderate. I cannot drink. And I cannot stop on my own. So this morning I got rid of all the empties, poured out the last bottle, took a shower and put on clean clothes and just started binging AA meeting after meeting on Zoom.

What span of time must hapoen between heavy drinking nights to fully eliminate any moderate symptoms from showing up or getting worse over time? (Excluding hangover symptoms of course)

What confuses me is that I cant find for the life of me, how long it takes the body to actually fully remove this possibility from happening. I read an article about a man who died from DT's after stopping his 1-shot scotch he had taken after brushing his teeth, which he did for 25 years.

From what I researched, it takes up to 72hrs for symptoms to show, and according to random reddit convos, up to 6 days. Even then, that doesnt matter. Those are just when actual symptoms show up or stop. How long until you can drink again but those symptoms dont show up the next tine?

What I want to know is, assuming your average college kid gets hammered at a party every time he goes out, are there studies or science behind the average time elapsed between heavy drinking, and especially over time, that causes withdraw symptoms to arise or get worse over time?

Me and my partner have slowly crept up to drinking nightly and its increasingly worrying. We're looking to sail between two boats. We recognize the situation.

Any advice is good advice.

Edit: I asked 3 clinitians and the answer I got was that for a normal person who has not experienced withdrawal symptoms, 10 drinks every 7th day is considered safe and would avoid accumulative symptoms for any gender and age/weight beyond 18, but if I did have symptoms, to detox for 6 months before proceeding. I have definitely experienced halucinations, bad dreams, nausia, shakiness, and flash sweats so I will be playing it safe and take 6mo.

I'm getting the impression that this question is frowned upon, and I think I can understand how it could be offensive or questionable. I think the consistent opinion I have found with alcoholics (I went to a lot of family AAA meetings), is that long term alcoholics seem to not be able to recognize that because they have an addiction, anyone who drinks does as well. Everyone has control over substances, it just takes strength and in some cases, good counselling and/or hospitalization/detox. 

Please keep your minds open to that. Good luck with your health!",2

My husband drinks too much

We‚Äôre in our 30s with 2 kids. He has a very good job. So do I.

Every night he drinks 8-9 beers, on a weekend it‚Äôs more like 12. He never drinks before midday and this is why he thinks he doesn‚Äôt have a problem.

I don‚Äôt drink at all and never have. So he‚Äôs basically drinking on his own every day, I‚Äôm just in the room.

Once he‚Äôs a few beers down I may as well have a conversation with myself as he‚Äôs not really ‚Äòthere‚Äô. He‚Äôs never falling over drunk or puking or anything. He has a high tolerance.

He gets up for work on a morning like nothing is wrong, however I can smell the stale alcohol every day.

I‚Äôve tried to speak to him and he just says ‚Äòyou snack a lot/spend money on Amazon‚Äô etc. Deflection constantly.

He won‚Äôt accept he has a problem but he has a high cholesterol and blood pressure and I can‚Äôt imagine the amount of money spent on beer monthly.

I don‚Äôt even know what I want from this post - I feel like I drive him to drink cos I‚Äôm boring or something? Because I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt know.",2

I never used to smoke much while drinking especially nicotine. Once or twice ever other year I would have a cigar or two with friends n now I'm smoking them on my own. 

Recently I've gotten nicotine in my vape juice. Before I would only smoke the juice that didn't have nicotine. When I got some with I noticed that I would get this like almost high feeling I used to get while drinkkng. Honestly this kind of thrilled me so I smoked more cigars and vapped more.

Then my lungs started to hurt alot. I have asthma too since I was little so that didn't help. Plus my anxiety started to get work. I found out from some that smoking can make certain mental illnesses worse. Do I decided to stop for a week then start again but lighter. 

Right now when I smoke I don't get that high anymore. This honestly made me smile more. I actually just got don't smoking a big cigar while vaping. No high and I feel extremely nauseous. 

I've also been looking into NA beers again n I'm nervous that means the worse. I hate having this need and scratch to fill this void. I don't want to get drunk or wasted off my ass but I just need something. 

I've also been slacking on AA work cause of work. I know lack of meetings tends to lead to relapse for me due to experience. But I'm so tired during the day and have so much shit to get done too. Though maybe that's an excuse. 

I feel like I know what I have to do but am in my own way to do them. I feel kind of lost. I just want to be ok and not become a mess again.

(I know smoking in the program is a touchy subject sometimes and am in no way saying everyone is using smoking as an escape I'm just talk about myself)",3

So from a young age I've been around alcohol.  I started drinking in my early teens and now I don't drink work days but when I do drink, I tend to blackout. I don't have any control over it. Cold turkey is not an option I just really want a way to have more control. If anyone has any helpful information that would be great. I'm 30 now and it doesn't keep me from doing what I need to but I just can't control myself while I'm drunk. I drink fast and end up smoking cigarettes (I don't when I'm not drunk) and doing cocaine. I don't honestly want to do any of these things anymore but they're just hard to quit. My family is full of drunks. Dad went to jail when I was young, seen my parents in cuffs over drunken fights and now my parents are 60. Dad is just a drunk, step father is an extreme drunk. He was naked on the floor last I seen him (on a Thursday) and my mother is the same as me. Drinks occasionally or weekends but can't stop. My step father had stage 4 cancer he beat several years ago and since he beat cancer I honestly believe he thought he was going to die.  Now he drinks like he's going to. I try and stay away from the booze but it's ways around and it's a damn stressful world out there. If there's anything anyone can add or say I'd appreciate it. Feeling lost sometimes and feeling like it's just the way things will always be.

I wanted to add i have drank heavy for about 3 or 4 years now. My girlfriend passed away when we were engaged and I know that's not a reason to drink the way I do I just use it to help cope still. The rushing to get drunk and the drinking till I blackout is what scares me the most",6

I‚Äôve been a consistent daily drinker since 21 (30 now), I‚Äôve had a total of two 1 month periods where I went sober in those 9 years. 

So now that I‚Äôm 7 days into this I‚Äôm passed the majority of the horrendous withdrawal symptoms. Part of me feels extremely relieved to be sober and have more clarity. What I am struggling with is this deep sadness and low feeling I have. I feel so lost on who I actually am as an individual. It‚Äôs an extremely lonely and depressing feeling. I have a great support network and plenty of hobbies to keep me occupied but even with all that I can‚Äôt get my mind out of this slump I‚Äôm feeling. I hate that so much of my self confidence and individuality was dependent upon alcohol. I understand I‚Äôm only at the 7 day point so my body and mind are going through a lot of changes, but this low and lost feeling not only hurts mentally, it hurts physically as well. 

Is there anyone that has advice on how to conquer this inner demon?",5

I know this might not be the place, but has anyone else had a similar diagnosis? I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance if there's some to be had. If I remain sober, what are my odds of recovery? Not necessarily \*full\* recovery, since there's already damage done, but I guess what I'm asking is am I screwed?

Well that went down a path similar to how food becomes such a, well an enjoyment beyond the normal amount, an addiction. I enjoy alcohol, not as I need to function, nor as I need to life my day to day life, but as nights falls, I slip into the dark dunes of, alcohol. I enjoy it, it relaxes me, or well it did.

Hi all, I have a sponsee who is procrastinating and postponing working the steps. We are only in our second week together and I already feel like I am having to run after her to organize our sessions while she makes trivial excuses. She assures me she really wants to meet up and it's not her fault but just this and that and a job she's waiting to hear back from, but I don't buy it. I think if it really was a priority for her to work her steps she would make the time- because last I heard she doesn't even have a job and was bored at home. But she's just full of excuses and busy when i try and get her to commit to a date. My question is, at what point do I move on to another sponsee who actually wants to get better and put in the work. I know us as addicts ""left to our own devices we choose the easier softer way"", so how far do I also go in trying to push her to do these steps or make fire under her? I have told her now more than once straight that meetings(while essential to recovery) on their own do not guarantee longterm sobriety. She has been at this for 18years and she still hasn't worked the steps. I told her outright today that she is going to 2x meetings a day or one every day, but she's going to meetings to hear other people talk about their experience working the steps (the same steps which she is not working)?

I really care about passing on this program so it's not that I will just give up on someone but there are a lot of people out there dying for me to waist time with someone who doesn't show up to do the work. But with her it's like she has a non sincere kindness or ""innocence"" which makes it awkward for me to trust my own thinking and whether I am just being a bitch/ too hard/strict or whether she is bullshitting me. I just feel like I'm getting lip service- no action. Something is just making me feel uneasy but I doubt myself because of her charisma or charm or pretenses. Is it perhaps manipulation? she has told me that she manipulates.",1

It doesn't even have to be alcohol made for consumption. Even with rubbing alcohol or just anything that smells like it, it bothers me to my core. I haven't had a drink since like September or something like that. But no matter how long it has been, the smell always takes me back. It especially sucks because people in my family will drink sometimes and since I haven't told them about my experiences with it I usually just bite my tongue. (In case anyone was worried, I do talk to people about it. My therapist knows even though I almost never mention it. My girlfriend knows and doesn't judge me about it. And then I also have a close friend who I talk to about it sometimes. I have a support system it just isn't my family when it comes to this.) One time I did tell my brother when he had a drink near me that I couldn't stand the smell and he was confused but didn't really question it, he probably just thought I generally just found the scent unpleasant. It's not like I'm around alcohol every single day but it just feels like an everlasting burden as I'll probably be around my family with it more times. Maybe friends at some point. I'm sure my 21st birthday will be a blast üòí but at the very least if my brother (because he's just generally like this and doesn't know my issues) pressures me into taking a sip my mom will likely step in and stop him.

I've had a really hard relationship with my Dad, it's hard to like him since he was my abuser for most of my life. Yet now knowing that his time on this earth is ending, it hurts me. He drank for almost two decades straight before he got sober, so I doubt his liver will ride this out very long. I'm only 20 and I have barely seen him since I left at 18. While I don't miss alot of parts of him, he's still my Dad and I will miss those parts. I'm not really good at talking to him so I'm making an art piece since I'm visiting next week. I'm doing a mandala of his favorite stupid dead meme, but I wonder if it's what he would like and want. 

I just want him to know I care, even though I'm not around to watch him kill himself. He's not a good person sober, but it's just so awful watching him become a mess again. I just want him to know I love and care for him. Yet, I also love myself and can't afford to visit often and relive it. I guess my whole question is, would you want an art piece that's just your favorite meme your kid drew. Would that make you happy if you were a drunk old man who never saw his kid?",3

I am not looking for medical advice rather I‚Äôm looking for anecdotal experiences. 

Drinking habits-
I‚Äôm a 25 y/o female and would not consider myself to have a drinking problem however at times I‚Äôve felt like I probably drink more than I should based on guidelines set by doctors. I‚Äôve been drinking since high school on the weekends and drank pretty heavily throughout college (binge drinking and partying on the weekends). Post college I still drink moderately on the weekends with friends but rarely do I drink Sunday- Thursday. When I drink on the weekends it‚Äôs usually 4-6 drinks a day (white claws, maybe a mixed drink) at the heaviest use or a few glasses of wine. When I go out to bars I often over do it and tend to black out.

Past weekend-
I went out of town with some friends and really overdid the drinking. This started Thursday night- Saturday night. We were drinking pretty consistently throughout the weekend. Saturday night was really bad and I ended up blacking out and being so sick a bouncer almost called a medic. Pretty sure I had alcohol poisoning. 

After effects-
Sunday; throwing up all morning, couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. Slept on the plane ride home. Didn‚Äôt feel too terrible.

Sunday night; was shaking/sweating, couldn‚Äôt sleep and I started having audial hallucinations which was terrifying. I was hearing people yelling outside and I was sleeping next to my boyfriend and he didn‚Äôt wake up or hear anything. I was also having scary dreams. 

Monday; laid in bed all day had EXTREME anxiety. Heart was racing, blood pressure elevated and I just knew that this was not normal for me. Pupils were huge, was shaky, brain fog. I‚Äôd never felt this way. Called a doctor and they had me come in to get bloodwork done.

Monday night; Was tossing and turning, alternating between freezing and sweating. 

Tuesday morning; woke up with extreme anxiety again, heart racing, felt dizzy and it was hard to see straight and I freaked out. Told my boyfriend we needed to go to the ER because I just didn‚Äôt feel normal. He tried to calm me down. I ended up making a phone appointment with a doctor and I talked with her. She said based on my prior drinking habits my symptoms didn‚Äôt seem too concerning and that I‚Äôd be at a low risk for any really bad symptoms but to go to the ER if things got worse.

So all in all I‚Äôm curious based on experience if this sounds like an alcohol withdrawal? Could I have built up a dependency based on my habits? 

TL;DR 
I‚Äôm a 25 yo female and a moderate drinker on the weekends. Went on a weekend trip with friends and overdid it all weekend but really overdid it Saturday night. Was so drunk I definitely had alcohol poisoning. I developed some scary symptoms over the next few days. Could this be a withdrawal based on past usage?",3

She has been hiding her drinking for a few years (at least the bulk of it) and I haven't seen her in a while. She lives in a nearby city and I hadn't seen her over the pandemic. We spoke occasionally, but my calls were rarely returned. Now I understand it is because she had lost her job and went into frequent/daily binge drinking. I believe she's a bit too fearful to go into an actual rehab program at the moment which is probably necessary to get sober. She drinks roughly 3-4 bottles of wine daily.

She's needing a place to stay to help curb the routine of drinking and have some support. I've offered my place and we've had many long conversations. She wants to try to ease into sobriety. She's fearful of detox and AWS. 

My understanding is that she likely cannot go ""cold turkey"". She has some benzodiazepines for withdrawal symptoms but does not know if that alone will help with AWS. 

I could write all day here giving more details but I'm looking for some help or guidance. My first concern is getting her out of a spiral alone and at home. I want to help curb or quit, but I do not know what to reasonably expect. She is willing and ready to quit, but terrified to death of AWS.",2

I am not a good drunk and it doesn't suit me, its been like that with me for many years. 
When I do decide to drink I often have too much and make a fool of myself. 
However I do not drink everyday, rarely and only socially. I do not crave drink and can sit happily having a soft drink when others are having alcohol. 
Sometimes I feel like a glass of wine after a hard day but I often don't give in to that or go out and buy it.
My biggest issue with drinking is when I get together with 
friends we have a bit too much but we've(boyfriend and I) had a talk about it and since the start of the year I haven't really been drinking and have been drunk once after a party

My boyfriend doesn't drink himself because he is on very strong opioid pain medication (ironically which he shows addictive signs on) so he can not mix the two. 

It has got to a stage where he wants to stop me seeing certain friends who drink or lot, or talks about me ""falling off the wagon"". I noticed when we were out with his mum and her friend they were drinking wine together but made a point not to offer me any (I didn't want any but they normally do).

I am concerned my boyfriend has said to other I have a drinking problem. 

Every time I have picked up a drink he has made me feel ashamed to the point where I just pretty much have stopped drinking altogether to avoid arguments. 

During the lockdown I drank more than I usually do (after losing my job) but have been honest about it and since stopped. Again this was socially but I registered his concern and I didn't like drinking that much anyway. 

His father is a full blown non functioning alcoholic so I understand why he doesn't like it. 

I just find it odd considering when we first got together I would have a glass or so of wine on occasion (on dates) and it wouldn't be a problem. 

Now I feel like a pariah when I so much as mention alcohol or seeing a friend who likes a drink. 

I am happy to continue not drinking, as I think its good for my health and I get headaches from one or two glasses, as I've said I'm not a good drunk and it doesn't suit me - so that part isn't the issue. 

I just feel hurt and slightly resentful of being treated like an alcoholic. I've been reading the AA book, speaking to friends and family about my drinking and they express confusion when I say I'm worried I might be an alcoholic in denial. 

I know it sounds silly but he's convinced me I have a huge problem.",7

Like the title says tonight I realised something. Something big. I think I might be an alcoholic. This last year has been rough for me just as it has been for almost everyone. Because of covid I have been forced to participate in school online and I have been cut of from my friends months at a time. What started as just a drink at the end of the week to relax escaleted into getting shitfaced atleaste two or three times a week, schoolnights included. I am just 18 years old and I have school, but with school comes a lot of test and studying. Three days from now I have a math test that will determine my grade in the class and instead of studying I chose to drink and play games with my friends. It was when one of my friends asked if I was drunk jokingly because I slurred my words and played horribly that it hit me how drunk I really was. In my mind I had had just had a little bit to drink, I didn't really realize that I was as drunk as I was. When I think about it I haven't been sober for longer that 2 days in a row the last couple of months. I want to stop, but I am afraid of how my parents will react when they find out and how the school will handle it. They have a zero tolerance policy to alcohol so I might be expelled if they find out that I have been drunk during school hours. I just feel like I'm trapped. If I get help and confess I might just get kicked out of school and my parents will hate me and if I don't stop I will slowly kill myself and destroy my life. Sorry for a long post I felt like I needed to vent a bit and maybe get some advice. Anyway sorry if my english is a bit bad it's not my first  language.",3

Our hope is that this podcast can help some fellow alcoholics out listen to something they can relate to. If anyone fancies a listen, here's the link:

I drink ""a lot"", but not drinking isn't a problem, it's not hard for me to not drink, the problem is that the day after tomorrow I want to be rested and able to function like a normal human so that I can help my partner be driven to and from her surgeries for 3 consecutive days. I've been cutting back the last two weeks, but I still can't seem to properly sleep without alcohol. I'm worried that I'll need to take shots in the middle of the night in order to deal with this in time, and I hate that, because I've never been in a place where I've had to do that before, but I really don't know what else I can do.
I'm sorry if this is a very irresponsible and naive thing to ask this group, but coming down from what I suspect is a high tolerance/dependency on alcohol is taking a lot longer than I figured it would, and I just want to be able to not drink without it ruining my sleep.

Anything you put before your sobriety you‚Äôll lose.  I had 10 years sober, and the arrogance to think I could drink again in 2017!  How foolish.

My ego is a monumental asteroid that crashes into anything in its path if I don‚Äôt work very diligently to right-size it.

A relapse, if you‚Äôre as relatively lucky as I am, looks like the following:

*40K of unnecessary debt
*1 seizure from alcohol withdrawal
*1 separate collapse in my home and ER visit
*Pending divorce from my husband of 7 years
*Potential loss of my home of 3 years
*Loss of my dog (husband insists on taking him)
*Alienation of parents and brothers‚Äî-again
*Isolation from friends who (legitimately) cannot handle my self-absorbed issues 
*Loss of job (two months ago‚Äînever been unemployed before)

This is not a complaint.  Just a evidence-based appraisal of what occurred when I was arrogant enough to think I could ‚Äúdrink socially again‚Äù.  Something I‚Äôve never done in my life.

I‚Äôd give this relapse business a 0.5/10.  Do not recommend.  Please be diligent and take my example‚Äîwhich, again, is filled with luck and fifteenth chances‚Äîas a warning.

I turn 39 on Tuesday.

Don‚Äôt be scared, the process is so rewarding and so worth it. Just celebrated 7 months a week ago. I‚Äôve gotten some people asking me how I‚Äôve managed to kick alcohol completely and still live a somewhat normal life. I‚Äôm 22 btw, was a big drinker and partier in college. When COVID hit that partying turned into solo partying in my room and a dependence on alcohol. When I would stop drinking I would withdraw. I‚Äôve been through every symptom of withdrawals short of a seizure. I should‚Äôve went to the hospital. The past 10 days I‚Äôve been at college to see the rest of my friends graduate. With it, there‚Äôs been a TON of alcohol and drinking and partying. I‚Äôve had alcohol in front of me several times, been alone with alcohol several times and I REFUSE to EVER touch the substance that has tried so hard to ruin my life ever again. My friends asked me the other day ‚Äúdo you ever get the urge to drink?‚Äù Absolutely I do, I told them. But only in the sense that I want to be considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and not because I need to. Here are some tips to quit for good. To preface, quitting is tough. There are good days and bad days. The most important thing I‚Äôve learned is the beginning is the absolute toughest part. Hands down. This deters many people. They think they can‚Äôt do it. I put barriers in place in my life to prevent me from ever drinking again. My mom and my closest friends know about my situation and they are incredibly supportive. Meaning if I take one sip of alcohol, they‚Äôd get on me super hard. That‚Äôs been a huge deterrent. They expect me not to drink, not the other way around. In the beginning I used to leave my credit cards and cash at home. I always bought a bottle heading home from work as a reward. In the beginning, you‚Äôre fighting against your brain. Making it as hard as you can to buy alcohol is your best friend. Tell someone you‚Äôre not going to drink too if you want. That may not work because I used to be super super sneaky back in my prime. It‚Äôs been 7 months as I mentioned, time is moving by so fast. I‚Äôm nowhere close to getting my life back in shape but I‚Äôm sober, healthy, and I wake up every morning feeling great.",21

She however considered going to a treatment facility for detox and maybe someone to just talk to so a potential for inpatient treatment as well.

The problem is she is bad spray tan yellow. Vomiting daily. She needs to detox and she needs medical help immediately.

She has stipulations like a private room while detoxing because she read reviews from facilities that read ""Was thrown into a room with 4 other women detoxing. Throughout the night various people would just show up to start their detox as well. Nurses did little to nothing to check in on you during this time etc.""

At the very least she is embarassed and scared and doesn't want to be vomiting beside someone else. Would a facility if I can find one that has a private detox even consider taking someone in this state without them seeking medical attention first?

She is clean now 20 days. The liver can be saved. Doctors said she can never drink again. She is still completely yellow, but she is clean and stopped smoking to boot.

I tried for 10 minutes to resuscitate him while our roommate called 911 but he was already blue by the time they got to our house. He was healthy and this was extremely unexpected. My life has been upended and all of this responsibility is on me now. I have turned to alcohol to help me feel/not feel? Idk. Sometimes it feels like the only time I can really feel the emotions that I try so hard to push down all day is by drinking. Then I can cry and feel the pain, and I want to feel that pain or else it feels like I didn‚Äôt love him or something. I know how much I love him but fuck everything is so twisted and not normal right now that my feelings just don‚Äôt make sense to me half the time. 

Anyways. I drink almost every night. I never used to be much of a drinker. I have always used alcohol as a coping mechanism so in high school I had a little bit of a problem with stealing my dads alcohol but since he would notice, that would limit it. Now I‚Äôm an adult and I can go to the liquor store and buy whatever and however much I want. So I do and I drink a lot now. My roommate doesn‚Äôt like this, he said we have to talk about it sometime. but I still go to work. I workout like Im supposed to, I do keep the house pretty clean. I‚Äôm functioning thanks to Prozac but that also makes me feel nothing. So in order to feel, I drink after work until I pass out. This has been a pretty consistent trend for about two months now and I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve had it under control. I don‚Äôt remember movies we watched sometimes or things I said but so? I still attend to my life duties. Idk why I‚Äôm making this post. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a major problem but how long do you think it will be before I do? I mean a big part of me really just wants to drink myself to death so it‚Äôs hard to find a real reason to stop. My life fuckin ended 3 months ago. There‚Äôs more backstory that I‚Äôm not willing to divulge but just know that we were soulmates, he got me through things that no one else could and now he‚Äôs just gone. I don‚Äôt understand. 

Alcohol and self harm make me feel something, even guilt is a better feeling than numb nothingness. But I have to feel numb most of the time to get through the day, alcohol helps me
Feel something different. Whether that‚Äôs feeling good, silly, guilty, sad. Human feelings instead of this robotic drone I‚Äôve turned myself into so that I don‚Äôt kill myself. Please don‚Äôt suggest therapy to me, I tried therapy. The therapist I had ghosted me and cancelled all of our appointments because I missed one. I was waiting in the zoom room alone at our last session. Fuck therapists. They can‚Äôt help me, they‚Äôre stupid humans too who can only speculate on the range of human emotions and experiences. I don‚Äôt do well with therapy it has historically made things worse for me.",3

I first started smoking weed since I was 14 and then on top of smoking weed I started taking acid when I was 16 at least 30 times in one year

I later learned that some of those tabs I took (at least 10) were laced with PCP or something crazy as my friend overdosed from them and that what came up in the drug test 

But I no longer smoke weed or take acid because I had an anxiety attack and can no longer handle anything or I freak out ( I believe I have derealization but have no money to see a medical professional)

But to finally get to the point I still have that I wanna be fucked up everyday feeling like I did with weed and acid, but now I replaced it with alcohol and nicotine. I don‚Äôt wanna end up with my parents but it‚Äôs something deep in my brain saying get fucked up. 

I was just wondering if anyone had the same thing as me and it slowly got worse over time and I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to live the rest of my life without the feeling of wanting to be kinda messed up on something very often.

She drank wine before but it‚Äôs gotten much worse post stroke. She can‚Äôt work anymore and used to be a social butterfly but can‚Äôt talk with people that much anymore. So I think she feels to a degree unworthy and what is the purpose, so she turns to wine to escape. 

During the pandemic it‚Äôs gotten worse. Where it once was just at night, it‚Äôs now midday and she‚Äôs addicted/can‚Äôt go without. 

Previously I would‚Äôve though rehab might be helpful but that involves talking and group sessions. I feel at a loss and unsure because so many resources don‚Äôt cover her niche issues. Any suggestions are welcome.

I lost my father a few days ago to end-stage alcoholism which was always there throughout his life, he was sober for many years and then he would always end up relapsing, it was a vicious cycle which ultimately cost him his life and I‚Äôm devastated, I always felt he loved his drink more than us and it was hard for him to stay away from it, he had a really bad blackout last Saturday which I screamed at him for not telling me for how much he drank and I found him dead in bed on Tuesday evening, so I‚Äôm finding it hard to even do anything right now, the funeral is tomorrow and I‚Äôm not ready for it at all, I‚Äôm terrified, but I know I have to go as he would have wanted us to be there for him. Just feel like life isn‚Äôt worth living anymore tbh.

UPDATE: The funeral was a great send off for him, some people were wearing the kit of the local team that he used to be a player for in which he was one of their best players, myself and my younger sister also did the readings, we both got very choked up reading them, and his goddaughters did the bidding prayers, myself, my twin sister and younger sister also did the offertory procession too, I was very lucky to be a pallbearer and help carry him into the hearse, out of the chapel and into the cemetery, his coffin was very heavy as he was a heavy man, so he wasn‚Äôt carried as far during the procession at the start, nor was he carried into the chapel, he had to be wheeled in instead which broke my heart as I felt we were letting him down by wheeling him down the chapel, nothing we could do though, a week today and it doesn‚Äôt feel real, I ended up ringing a bereavement service and they‚Äôre gonna send me out some leaflets and booklets on bereavement.",6

2021-05-13 15:46:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/nbpjws/looking_for_advice_for_my_younger_brother/,Looking for advice for my younger brother.,"My 26 year old brother got out of a recovery center 6 months ago. He went there because he crashed his car, lost his job, and got a DUI due to alcohol. Since then he has relapsed, for just a few days each time, 3 times. Every time he encounters stress he drinks heavily until we (his family) get on to him. 

This last relapse he said we were just making a big deal about it, meaning he‚Äôs not ready to want to quit for good (I knew this deep down). I talked to a psychologist and she recommended that he either go to a halfway house and to AA meetings, or to just let him be on his own and stop helping him when things get tough because he may need to fall harder this time to realize he has to FULLY change. 

I gave him those option. He doesn‚Äôt have money or car now so he‚Äôs asking me what I think about him moving to Miami to live with our mom and dad (both over 70 years-old) to get a job there and save money, then move out in ‚Äúone or two months maybe‚Äù he said. And ‚Äúmaybe get \[his\] own place there‚Äù. Him and I live 8 hours away from Miami currently.

The downside: (1) he may overstay, prolonging his need to become fully responsible for himself and falling harder, which unfortunately may be what he needs. I doubt my mom would make him move. (2) he may start drinking again and POSSIBLY hide it from mom, although it‚Äôs pretty obvious when he‚Äôs picked up drinking since he drinks throughout the day (3) he may not necessarily find a reason to drink while there since he‚Äôs being supported in a way by my grandparents (free lodging, prepared food) and for that reason may not really encounter much stress while living with them--also prolonging his fall. (4) Lastly, Miami is a party city, full of temptations. 

The upside: (1) he can help my mom and dad who need help with things sometimes (2) my parents do feel very lonely living alone far from us so that would help them (3) he may find purpose in life and decide to change because they need him (4) being with my mom may make it much, much harder for him to start drinking because currently all it takes is my mom to call him crying for him to stop drinking immediately. 

With this limited info would you think him going to Miami would be a good option? Or can you identify a big reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be?",4

2021-05-13 09:44:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/nbgyu7/help_me/,Help me.,"Hi! I'm posting this on an alt. I'm an alcoholic. 

So, a few years ago, my drinking was really, really bad and I was oblivious to it. It cost me a marriage, but that brought me back to reality. I stopped drinking. I went to AA for 4 months and I was sober for a year. 

Around that time, I (26F) met another wonderful woman (24F) and we've been together for around a year and a half now. For the first 14 months or so, alcohol wasn't a problem at all. I only drank with her occasionally (like a few glasses once a month or so) and it was just wine. Never hard liquors. We had fun and I never felt compelled to drink any more than that. Until recently. I've recently began feeling more stressed at work and finding myself going back to my old ways. Right back to getting vodka on my way home from work and drinking half a fifth a night between the time my girlfriend goes to bed and the time I go to bed. The guilt of this has slowly been creeping up on me and I recognize that it's become a problem again and that I need to stop. I'm going to stop again.

&#x200B;

Here's my main dilemma: Do I tell my girlfriend? She has all the trust in the world in me and I hide it very well. I'm certain she doesn't suspect I've been drinking like this. I think it would break her heart to know. I've decided I'm done drinking and I know I have the strength to do that again so I'm not really concerned about that. I'm just worried about whether I should tell her or not. On one hand, it could be better to leave her in the dark, blissfully unaware of my struggles in order to save our relationship from that strain. On the other, she's the love of my life and I don't like keeping things from her. What do I do?",42

I was doing so well, even through the early part of COVID, while I was working 60 hr/wks for a healthcare provider. All my friends moved out of state, but I was still doing ok. Then my mom developed Alzheimers, which has progressed very rapidly. I visit her and my dad once a week, but it is difficult to endure more than a hour of visiting without a drink. I know that makes me sound like a horrible person, but I'm trying, and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. **One drink, I can do one drink during my visits.**

After 11 months of 60hr weeks, and praise from my colleagues; they hire someone else to fill the higher position I'd been promised. They couldn't afford to lose me in my position at the moment. Rationally, I admit, it is very true. I'm working a complex job that is changing rapidly due to COVID conditions, and a noob wouldn't have the experience to make on-the-fly adjustments. **One drink, I can have one drink after work.**

Gotta quit, but I have three beers in the fridge. I don't want to be wasteful. Ok, I'm finished, but I'm only slightly buzzed. If this is going to be my last night, I should be allowed to have one more. Not to get hammered, but to get to a respectable level. Next day: shoot, I've got five beers left from the six pack I bought so that I could drink one. Can't let those go to waste.

I love drinking and smoking at the moment, they're my best friends.  They haven't really been causing me any problems, but I might be in denial.

Yes I'm a morning drinker :-)  I've stopped for a month or two a couple of times in the past 3 years but then something happens and I go back.  Anyway I have high hopes of landing this job or a job that I'm happy in and then I will be able to drink again after I've paid everyone back (I won't be drinking before work or during the day though, I only do that now because I'm bored at home).  So that's probably like 1-3 months off the booze <3  Anyway that's just what's on my mind atm.  So happy to be on day 3, tempted to go get some drinks as got paid today, but I can't spend the power bill money on booze, that's how I ended up here.  I slept better last night, so I am sure tonight will be even better and I'm getting shit done, just washed my car... that would never happen if I was drinking, as I sit outside drinking from sometimes 8am all day, trying to find friends who are free to chat with me during the day and not looking for jobs which I have been more proactive at in the last few days.  Pretty tragic stuff really.

He died yesterday, alone in a hotel room, from drinking too much. This poem is for him. I love him so much.","I‚Äôm not angry with you, I somewhat understand 
 
But what had you gone through? 
Why didn‚Äôt I ask? What had happened before I knew you?

You never felt good enough, but you were so loved 
Lighthearted, kind, not quite serious enough 
Friendly, fun, always adventurous 
Proud of your fortune, happy to offer what you could
Moments of greatness, moments of enough

Drinks to mask the pain
Drinks to show the fun
Drinks to ease the boredom of a life felt undone

But did you not know how great you were?
What a father! Changing diapers, cooking, going to the zoo, and all the rest!
A partner since high school, love of a life! Irreplaceable memories all by your side
And a friend, only the best, unmatched in loyalty, love, and generosity 

When others had to leave early, your smiles waned
The hole inside was not the same
Light was hidden under a blanket of clouds
Somehow you only could only feel pain 

You are a memory now
We cannot enjoy your smile, laugh, story, companionship, ideas, humor, love, friendship 
I understand, but why did you have to go?

So many moments left to live
So many laughs left to feel
So many tears to wipe away

I don‚Äôt understand all of you, I never could
Fifteen years--part of a life shared across a block, across an ocean
You showed me life beyond my worries
You were the best friend when I was alone

The memories are as clear as a bell!
The times we laughed, the kids were so small 
Weren‚Äôt we happy? Weren‚Äôt the hard times fun?
But what if I forget? 
Then will you be gone? 

Life is for the living, so I must not join you 
But I‚Äôm so far away from all who love you
Alone again, now I‚Äôm misunderstood 
No one here knew your friendship, your sorrow, your fun
If you knew the grief I feel, would you still have gone?

What about your kids? Did you not think of  them? 
Did you not know what this would do to them?
How could you misunderstand, how could you not know, how much we all love you? 

No one who knows you will be unaffected
This is only the beginning 
A seed, sorely planted
God only knows what will bloom

Should we forgive, what wasn‚Äôt asked?
Should we forget your last acts?
Why would you leave us? 
Didn‚Äôt you know? That this will be your legacy?! 
Did you tip the bartender? Did you say farewell? 
Why burn in us, the hatred you felt for yourself?

There‚Äôs no end to your suffering
It‚Äôs on us to share for now
A tear shed won‚Äôt ease the sadness
But god help time, may ease the pain

Goodbye for now, cheers to you
I hope your next chapter welcomes you
God help us not to be angry
God help us to remember only the best of you",62

I'm 30 years old. I have spent my 18s to 25s smoking weed and taking the edge off that way. I was a 24/7 stoner

Since then, I found a job that I love, but most people i work with expect a lot from me. To deal with the stress i started drinking. about a case of beer a week (24) , a bottle of wine and a bottle of whisky. Maybe 1/4th of the time i drink more, but that seem to be the least amount I drink.

At work, The days where I have been the most hangover have been the most fulfilling ones. I always felt as reinforcement that I didnt drink that much but after conversation with loved ones, they told me that my drinking may have had adverse effect on my health.

It may sound dumb, but my addictive personality is a way to escape mt brain. I just cant deal with my self- awareness and memory 24/7. All my relative tell me I could conquer the world if I just applied myself, but nothing repulse me more than the thought of letting myself rule over other people. So I numb myself, trying to fool everyone, because if I gave 100% to every job i had, I would make everyone look foolish.

I dont want to seem self involve. I have been described that way, but I dont want to be. I know im a dumbass.",3

I'm looking for some advice on how to best support my mom. She has been sober for a year now, but of course she was always really good at hiding her drinking so I'm not sure. Today was her first night alone being sober as my dad is away on a trip. He wanted my siblings and I to check in with my mom sporadically while he is gone so I called her tonight. However, she said ""does everyone know I'm alone or something"" and then seemed quite upset on the phone. I've never had productive conversations with her about her recovery. She seems to carry so much shame and she says that talking to her children about it is really hard.

I just am upset because I feel like I make her feel worse when I am trying to support her. Also, it's awkward to just never address the elephant in the room. I guess is there anything I could say to let her know that I don't think down upon her and don't think she should feel ashamed? Any thoughts are appreciated.",2

Literally every day. 

I‚Äôve decided I was sick of this lifestyle, and noticed my ability to absorb information has been extremely hampered (to my belief) by my habit. I‚Äôm on day 3 of zero alcohol, but after work yesterday I was hit with extreme fatigue after work. Had issues falling and staying asleep these few days, but for the most part, my body feels better. However after taking a nap yesterday, I work up unable to concentrate, and focus. Today at work, I had to leave early because just standing on my feet and working (physical labor) I couldn‚Äôt handle it. Woozy and complete brain fog. Is this something normal for somebody who has struggled with alcohol addiction? It‚Äôs not making me want a beer, and if anything just makes me want to quit more (it‚Äôs fucking hard tho), but I‚Äôm more-or-less curious if others have experienced something similar, and if this is normal.

A few weeks ago I got the shakes pretty bad. I chugged a beer and got a friend to take me to an urgent care. I'd shaken like this but never nearly as bad. My blood pressure was 200/130 and my heart rate was around 140 bpm. They immediately called an ambulance and had me admitted to a hospital. I got pumped full of ativan, chlordiazepoxide, and several fast acting heart medications via IV. My [CIWA-Ar](https://www.mdcalc.com/ciwa-ar-alcohol-withdrawal) score was something like 30. After about a week admitted, they got it down to 3 and sent me home with essentially an entire pharmacy's worth of medications. I haven't had a drink since and I feel SO much better.

Please don't think you can just drink the shakes away. They never get better if you don't address them. I genuinely believe that my life was saved that day. You can do it.

2021-05-11 08:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n9w5ga/3_years/,3 Years,"This month (17th I believe) marks 3 years free from alcohol. For close to two decades I depended on alcohol for a lot of things. It was my primary source of entertainment. I'd spend every weekday waiting fo the weekend so I could drink. Eventually that became not waiting and just drinking on week nights as well. I'd usually skip two or three days a week. There were times when over extended holidays like Christmas I'd binge hard and I found it difficult to get drunk (though I always did) because of my tolerance build up and my body harshly rejecting those initial drinks. 

I couldn't imagine a life without booze. It gave me courage, it was the one thing I did to feel good. I think I suffered from mild depression earlier in life and drinking caused it to become a lot worse. It was also the ""only thing"" that would fix it. I'm an introvert and when I drank I became an extrovert and I liked that feeling. It allowed me to live in the moment and be more care-free. 

It caused a lot of problems in my relationships in life. I lost the respect of people who I loved. My kids had to see their dad drunk quite often and sometimes passout in the middle of the afternoon. Often times I'd wake up from passing out in the middle of the night and resume drinking because I felt so horrible then feel guilty because suddenly it was now 9AM and I was loaded. 

People tried to convince me to stop but it never worked. It was only when I quit under my own volition and conviction that I made some lasting changes. In the beginning it was hard, I had to change my lifestyle and accept that if I wanted to succeed I just wouldn't be able to drink anymore. It was more appealing to recover from alcohol than to continue the battle with it as part of my life. In the beginning it took willpower but eventually all I needed to stay sober was logic and self-control. 

Things are now much better in my life. Along with quitting booze I also quit cannabis about 1 year ago. Those are probably two of the most important changes I have ever made in my life. Recovering took time. It wasn't just a matter of not drinking anymore, I had to do a lot of self analysis as well and take steps to repair the damage that booze did over the years. By this I mean learned behaviors, patterns of thinking, relationships, outlook on life, how I looked after my health, and more. It's become an endless endeavour to continue making life better and grow as a person. I'm 41 and feel like in a lot of ways life has just begun. While I do have regrets of the past I don't dwell on them and try my best to use them as lessons for growth and reminders of where I can find myself if I make bad decisions.",80
2021-05-11 07:04:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n9ufo7/i_dont_know_if_ill_ever_be_able_to_stop_feeling/,I don't know if I'll ever be able to stop feeling ashamed,"After one too many times of binge drinking and blacking out and beginning health problems, and failed attempts of limiting consumption, I have finally taken the steps to quit drinking alcohol. Only 3 days sober so far, but I can honestly say that I was never so certain that I'm never touching another bottle again. I'm working on creating new healthy habits and working on my emotions to get to the bottom of why I always felt like I needed a drink in the first place.

I can't however stop thinking about the fact that I apparently peed myself while blackout drunk. On several occasions. No one knows this, and I can't fathom how it even happened. Every time when I found a pool of water (which I assumed it was, because it looked like water and had zero smell) on the floor in the morning I assumed I must have spilled some when carrying a glass to my bedside table and so I'd just mop it up. Only one time, after a day or two, I noticed the stench of the mop I used  which I did not rinse after (since I thought it's just water anyway). On another occasion I was actually at a friend's house, we were both drinking till very late at a bar and I blacked out again, he had less to drink so he responsibly took me home and I stayed the night on his couch. Seeing a small pool of water on the floor in the morning we both automatically assumed I must have spilled some at night and just did not notice, no big deal, right? But then, after coming home the next day I realized one of my socks, that was also soaked (which I just threw in my backpack to throw in the laundry when I'd get back home), started to smell.

I feel so ashamed because of this. Even though I have absolutely no recollection of doing it, I know that's what happened. I believe it has happened 3-4 times within the last 6 years. I can't imagine admitting this to my friend and I just hope he rinsed the mop well and won't smell that it was not water after all. I know I don't ever want to drink again, but I wish I could somehow deal with this feeling of complete shame. I feel disgusted with myself, even more so that I wasn't able to quit after the first time I realized what had happened, nor the second time. Why did it take me 3 times (I think one of those 3-4 times might have actually been simply spilled water, because a lot of signs suggest that, but just the fact that I can't be sure is part of the problem) to finally put my foot down and want to become sober instead of lying to myself that I'll limit drinking?

I feel like shit and I really wish I knew what to do about it.",5

I'm very worried about her, I don't know what to do.


I've been friend with this girl since we were 3 and during our childhood, up until age 12/13, we were absolute besties. Then, with high school and everything (she chose a school which was very distant from mine) we kind of naturally drifted apart, but still we remained good friends. Now we hang out maybe once a month and I still care deeply about her.

Now, my concern is this: about a year ago this girl found a new, big group of people to hang out with, especially at night, and they were pretty heavy drinkers. My friend had never done such things before but she quickly got involved. 
From there, from my point of view, things went down very fast. Last summer she was ALWAYS drunk, I can't recall an evening when she wasn't shitfaced at some random guy's house. If you ask her, most of her summer feels like a blur. 

At first I wasn't worried, I am a drinker myself and I really enjoy partying (even if I don't do it every single day like her, maybe once a week). I was convinced she would have calmed down with school starting again in september, but she didn't.

Now the situation is even worse. I was at her house a few days ago (I'm a very close friend with her sister too) and she came home at 5pm (so not even at night) barely able to walk, crying and desperate because she was convinced she had injured her ankle (which she did). She threw up, we made her drink some water, medicated her and put her to bed.

Then her sister, who's very worried too, told me that she does this every single time she hangs out with her friends. In the past month she has twisted her ankle twice, scraped her knee very badly and hit her head on a bathtub. She also lost her phone and nearly got in an car accident with her motorcycle. I was honestly shocked. I catched up with her the following day and she was already out drinking again.

I'm very worried about her health, I'm afraid she will injure herself seriously one of these days and end up in the hospital. Her parents suspect something but don't do anything, also because they barely see her as she is always out or in her room. She blames her injuries on volleyball training.

Should I tell her parents? What should I do? I'm worried sick, but I don't want her to hate me (and if I told her parents she definitely would).",26

When I saw them, I was livid but I didn't say anything. We get to my mom's. He drinks all six mini wine bottles so of course, it's obvious that he is intoxicated. My mom said he needs to go so I took him home. My mom insisted on coming along for my safety.  He once again apoligized and promised it would never happen again. I stayed at my mom's last year for a few weeks, working remotely and invited him over during the day. He was fine the first few days. Then we had lunch at KFC and I found it odd that he had saved the cup and was drinking out of it the next day. He was doing that to hide that he was drinking whiskey. While I was working and not paying attention, he would pour whiskey into the cup. He was stumbling all over my mom's and nearly fell into her glass table. I asked him to leave, which he did but he came back 20 minutes later and my mom was home from work. We had to call his parents to come pick him up. He called me the next day to apologize and because I wouldn't graciously accept his apology, he got mad and said I got him arrested and he didn't need friends like me. For about nine months, we didn't talk. Then he calls me and once again, he says he has changed his ways. He is done with alcohol and for a few weeks, he seemed fine. I had booked my trip to Seattle and asked him to join me as he had convinced me that he was through with drinking since he got some not so great news from his doctor. He then called me at 2:30 AM, drunk and ready to chat. When I explained that I was asleep and didn't appreciate him calling me at that hour, he called me judgmental and self righteous and said he didn't need a friend that got him arrested. Later, he sent me incoherent text attempting to apologize and said this vacation would be the trip of a lifetime and he couldn't wait. Here is where I need advice I have a feeling he is going to get drunk. Should I just leave him where he is or make sure he gets help? Is it wrong of me to just wash my hands of him? I really don't want to spend my vacation babysitting him but want to hear other perspectives.",2

Hi there. I‚Äôm 19 and my best friend is 18. Over the last few years I‚Äôve noticed an unhealthy addiction starting for alcohol (as well as pot, but nowhere near as worrisome as the alcohol). Addiction runs in his family, and it even killed his parents at a young age. 

He now lives with his abusive aunt and uncle, who are unfortunately both alcoholics, to top this, the aunt and uncle fight all the time even with some events causing 911 calls. Long story short, his past (and current situation) has led him to a worrisome addiction to alcohol. He often tells me that he has one drink a day. Luckily he doesn‚Äôt have his license, but any time I try to talk to him he says that I‚Äôm overreacting. Any advice? 

I don‚Äôt know how to help him if he claims that there‚Äôs no issue and I don‚Äôt want him to end up like his abusive aunt and uncle. 

Side note: His mood, behavior, and morals have changed drastically over the past year, likely as a result of the drinking",5

I've been drinking daily for about 25 years. I'm 43 now.

The addiction was something I managed well for a really long time. Even today, alcohol has never interfered with my professional life. With respect to my personal life, I've had all the normal slip-ups that people dismiss with ""oh he was just drunk."" In other words, I've not had a DUI, been to jail, or done something so heinous that I've had family members cut me out of their lives. Simply put, I am by all accounts a ""functional alcoholic."" 

I used to manage my drinking by restricting it to the evening. A few stiff ones at night when I was winding down seemed fine. Yeah, I was still getting drunk. But I like how drunk feels. And it's never caused much of a problem so I just coasted on the water's current.

I'm not sure when things changed. But they have. I workout regularly. I do a lot of cardio. Part of the reason for that is that I know there's a ton of calories in booze so I use the cardio to sweat it out and stay inside something tolerably obese. Working out also makes me feel really good. It makes me feel in control. I decide to do it; and I do it. Always nice to pat yourself on the back for what makes you proud.

Yet lately I've also felt a lot of isolation. In my dating life, I think others notice how much I'm capable of drinking without appearing drunk. What a red flag that must be. Every date is partially an imagining of what that other person would be day-to-day and my behavior makes it clear that romance with me is romance with a middle-aged drunk. Not appealing.

Coupled with the isolation is the anxiety. When I drink more than usual, the next day is defined by anxiety and panic attacks. Xanax helps. But nothing seems to help like a few fingers of vodka. Because I'm an alcoholic, having that in my bloodstream helps me feel ""normal."" In private I wonder if I've become one of those drunks so dependent on alcohol that I risk death quitting cold turkey. 

I have a therapist. Problem drinking is one of the issues we discuss. But I'm not honest with him about my behavior. I'm also terrified of seeing my doctor. In my head, I imagine disclosing how much I drink and feeling his disapproval. He orders a bunch of tests and scans, and I find out I have 45 minutes left to live. 

If I'm being truly honest, I'll share that part of the reason I drink is because I'm a coward. I don't know how the transition happened but somewhere along the line it stopped being a machismo thing and turned into a blanket I hide beneath because I cannot manage otherwise. 

I've tried to sober up. The most I managed was 7 days. Seven long, dull, and sweaty days without sleep and feeling like nothing was right. I've considered AA, but I'm an atheist. I'm looking into psychedelics because they have some success in changing addictive behavior. Right now I don't know what to do. Because for the first time in my life I wake in the morning and want a glass of wine. I'm not indulging that impulse yet, but it that impulse being there is new and troubling. The progression of the disease is clearer to me. 

I suppose I just needed to share where I am. The fuck of it all is that I really, really like not being sober. And I really, really hate that fact about me. Not sure if I can change. Not sure if I want to. Simply wanting to be confessional about it since I cannot talk to anyone else with full honesty.",23

The worst of it is how time feels like it's slipping by, but even experimenting with a \~month sober that never went away.

&#x200B;

It just feels fairly alienating and hard to related to people about quitting when they've got actual bottom moments. Rock bottoms, even. Driving drunk, fumbling the ball with their spouse/kids, fucking up and getting fired at work, etc. I've been in this rut for like a half decade and I don't know of it's a tell of my resilience or luck, but I'll frequently run into people who have been at it for half as long as me, at half the intake, that are in a MUCH worse spot than me. I know this should be a sign of fortune for me to get my hands on the reigns sooner than later, but it's hard to when everyone else I know with a problem (that I know of, to be fair) is to a point that seems so distant it's just a thought of ""holy shit, thank god i'm no where near that far yet"". 

&#x200B;

Problem is, my liver won't care if I can otherwise keep it up for 20 more years, it'll degrade all the same. And I don't mean to undermine those who are struggling more than me, sincerely. I've realized I'm a bit of an abnormality, even with taking in accounts posted by those with (relative) anonymity on the web. 

&#x200B;

I just have problems with relating and seeing myself in others when the two closest groups to me are ""I used to work on a 24-pack a week but my doc had me work it down to a 12-er because my liver numbers were a bit high!"" and ""Oh god, I was supposed to pick up the kids from my wife last night & head into work early today, but I just now came to at noon and have 22 missed calls between my wife and my boss."" I know the obvious long term motivator at this point should be health, but fuck, it's hard man.",10

I‚Äôm 27, my dad is an alcoholic. He has been my whole life. We‚Äôve never had the best relationship, I always thought he was super mean growing up, I didn‚Äôt know it, but it‚Äôs because he was drunk most of the time. The past year though, has been worse. My parents have been together for 28 years. My dad was in a car accident in February, ended up getting charged with a DUI. His BAC was .21 I believe. My mom moved out and into her sisters for one month. Then moved back in with my dad because he was getting ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. Which he has in the past and he‚Äôs never stuck with it. 

I didn‚Äôt want her to move back in with him. I want her to leave him. But that‚Äôs not my call. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs in denial. He‚Äôs not a nice person when he drinks and I worry for my moms safety, even though she doesn‚Äôt. My dads drinking has caused a HUGE divide in our family. I set a boundary after his accident, I told him I didn‚Äôt want him in my life until he was sober. I support him in getting help, but I can‚Äôt keep getting my hopes up that he‚Äôs getting better and to just be let down over and over again. And my family has been making me feel like the worst daughter in the world ever since. 

Last night, my dad was admitted to the psych ward. His BAC was .33...... .33

I wanted to scream at my mom ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU SO. THIS WILL NEVER STOP‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt. He will be released tonight. 

I‚Äôm starting therapy next week in hopes to help with my family drama and the trauma that my parents have caused me in the past.

Anyone have any advice/tips/stories they‚Äôd like to share in dealing with an alcoholic parent?

I was drinking a minimum of 12 beers a day and tapered down. I did it on my own. Now I drink occasionally. When I say that I mean I only drink about twice a week. I went out lastnight with some friends and honestly the bar scene just isn‚Äôt my thing anymore and neither is drinking at all. Instead of giving myself those two nights out of the week, I‚Äôm just gonna cut the shit all together... the feeling of being buzzed or even drunk doesn‚Äôt satisfy me as it used to. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I wish I could enjoy it like I used to, and enjoy it like everyone else does. But since I actually quit, it‚Äôs like an off switch in my brain that tells me drinking sucks... I‚Äôve been exercising and go hunting with another group of friends and it‚Äôs so much more fulfilling, in so many levels. I don‚Äôt even desire to go out for an occasional drink, I only do it because my friends are there. And I remember the alcohol cravings... nowadays I crave time with my brothers and family above anything, I crave profound and vulnerable conversation that‚Äôs worthwhile, I just wanna talk to you. Real vulnerable human connection is the only thing I want. And it‚Äôs like my eyes opened. That right there is the real drug to me. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been really craving this whole time. Imagine, walking outside somewhere in the woods or on a beach with the people or person that matters most... that‚Äôs where the petal meets the metal and rubber meets the road, because that‚Äôs where all the memories are created. That‚Äôs something worth remembering. Did anyone on this subreddit have this experience after quitting?",49

If I buy a 12 pack I‚Äôll drink it in two or three days (Im a big ass dude with a fresh liver so this is doable with zero hangover at this point) and can‚Äôt keep it around. If I don‚Äôt have any alcohol I don‚Äôt get cravings, so all I need to do is not buy any, but that‚Äôs easier said than done when every grocery and convenient store you walk into has 1/8th of the whole store dedicated to beer and wine. How do I resist the temptation to pick up some alcohol when I go to the store, when it‚Äôs so readily available each time? Im worried that I could fall into addiction if I don‚Äôt get some better self control with this.

Edit: for more context I‚Äôve been 21 for a few months now and haven‚Äôt developed an addiction but I‚Äôve been having this battle since I turned 21. Basically it just results in me buying a 12 pack of modelo negra or some other delicious tasting beer on my weekly grocery shopping trip. Don‚Äôt have a problem with avoiding buying gas station piss light beer, but the temptation is still there. I really enjoy the taste of a good cold beer, especially stuff on the stouter end and that just makes the temptation worse. I‚Äôd like it if I could just keep my drinking to the weekend when I‚Äôm with friends instead of catching a hard buzz by myself in the evenings. I‚Äôd like it if I could buy it and just have one with dinner or something but if I buy it im gonna get drunk off it. Im the exact same way with weed where I‚Äôll buy a few grams to hang out with my friends, but then I just end up smoking whats left of it every day on my own instead of saving it for the next time Im with the boys. I basically lack self control when it comes to any substance and I could see myself becoming an alcoholic due to the ease of access of alcohol.",2

He's been an alcoholic my whole life, but within the last 6 years has started mixing pills and weed, and other things into the mix. He's basically MESSED up all day, everyday. He doesn't work because he's retired. He's received 2 DUIs so he can't drive anymore. He doesn't know how to use the phone or the internet so he's isolated. He doesn't want to learn though (we've tried a million times). It seems like he stopped caring about personal hygiene (he smells sort of weird). Basically, he gets up around 10 AM every morning, then goes for a bike ride, then comes home and gets obliterated. He stumbles around, says nasty things (when they're comprehendible), talks to himself, talks about him being the victim of misfortunes (so annoying) and overall is basically intolerable to be around. His favorite thing to do is talk about things that upset him on FOX news (watches the news almost 24/7 when it's raining outside).

We've tried to help him many times. We (my whole family) even got him into a rehabilitation program that cost $3000 a day, but he only stayed for a week and a half. We've tried to interest him in things, do things with him (he doesn't like to do anything really - which is the problem). My mother wants to plan a vacation with him, but he doesn't want to go. He has no hobbies (he's actually really smart though). I'm still not giving up on him so I'm asking everyone here for any ideas to get him out of this downward spiral.

When he's like this he's also sort of unpredictable to be around. He can get into this aggressive mood where he sort of hard (no where near full force though), slaps me across the face, then laughs and says he was kidding and he was sorry. Or he will pull my hair pretty hard (once I was driving and he was in the passenger seat and he out of nowhere pulled my hair hard enough to pull my whole body with it). I'm his daughter and I've grown to be hesitant to even be around him when he's like this because I think he's out of his mind.

Also - he is completely ruining my mother's life and making her miserable. He doesn't do a single thing to help around the house (he'll lay on the sofa all day when its raining and he can't go outside, and watch me and her clean the entire house on our only day off, and not ever get up).",3

In fact I can‚Äôt recall when I started drinking heavily. What I believe is I started drinking every day around 20 years ago, and have had very few days without drinking in that time. Even when I‚Äôm ill, I drink if I can. At least 1 or 2 bottles of wine, 4/5 pints, or equivalent in spirit. Saying that, I‚Äôm a functioning drinker. I have a good job, wife, kids, etc, but I know what it‚Äôs doing to my body. I also have far too many half memories of getting pissed and upsetting those closest to me... too many lost friendships.

So on Tuesday I decided not to drink that day. It‚Äôs now Thursday evening and I‚Äôve not drunk in 3 days! I can‚Äôt remember going 3 days without drinking! It‚Äôs a little win, but it‚Äôs something.

I‚Äôm not feeling great though. Anxious, heart palpitations, can‚Äôt sleep, headache, moody, etc. Seems my blood pressure is 154/91 too. I guess this is all part of withdrawal?

I was a daily weed smoker right before bed and i was addicted to that too so I stopped smoking. Drinking has taken over, and I‚Äôve gained 10 pounds in the process.

I don‚Äôt want people to freak out and worry about me, right now I‚Äôve got this on lock and at this point I don‚Äôt think I could let someone else ruin that for me, I‚Äôd have to do that myself. 

So anyways a friend of mine has relapsed and I‚Äôve been trying to think if there‚Äôs anything that I would have liked to hear when I was down in that hole. I don‚Äôt really think there‚Äôs much. I think I did my best by just saying ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre feeling okay today and I‚Äôll always be around if you need to talk‚Äù.

I know no one can fix someone else. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said all the support I received from family didn‚Äôt help me at all. But I just want to make it very clear that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôll listen without judgement. We got sober the same week, exactly 6 months ago, and I feel slightly guilty talking to them because I don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm stronger. I‚Äôm not, it took me 5 years to get here and they‚Äôre only a year in.

It‚Äôs really hard too because I can‚Äôt blame them 100%. I mean I can, but to put it in perspective, they were in a sober home because they KNEW they weren‚Äôt ready to be out on their own yet. We got a covid lockdown recently and they shut down the sober houses and rehabs and sent everyone away without supervision. This person knew they didn‚Äôt have the tools necessary to face the world yet but they‚Äôve now been forced to and it didn‚Äôt work out. 

So, what sentence do you wish you could have heard sooner? If any.

This is my story.","I first went to AA/NA about 5 years ago, my life WAS unmanageable. I was often putting myself in dangerous or mortifying positions. I would embarrass myself and suffer crippling anxiety for weeks afterwards or take stupid risks like ""borrowing"" cars and driving under the influence (despite never having had a licence) or stealing money from work.

I remember my first meeting and sharing that every week I would feel I'd hit rock bottom only to sink further the next weekend. How much further could I go than waking up half naked in a van parked outside my work, sleeping in my coke dealers garden, having group sex with 5 of my neighbours and feeling so ashamed i moved out the next day. Having hazy blackout memories of being followed in to an alleyway by two men but not hav ing a clue what happened and living in fear of seeing them again and not knowing who they were.

I stayed clean for a record breaking 10 days and never went back after I relapsed. Despite my continued using, my life hasn't been like that for a long time. I think it's due in equal measures to; my  diagnosis of bipolar and the subsequent treatment, having a higher tolerance than I can afford to spend on my habit these days and being older and therefore less of a party girl.

I thought the fact that I haven't had any rock bottom moments in a while meant I haven't got a problem but I've come to realise that while I haven't been crashing, I haven't been rising either. I recently turned 31 and realised I've NOTHING to show for the last decade. 

I don't black out or wake up in strange places any more but I can't think of a single problem or obstacle I've had in the last five years that wasn't either created or exacerbated by using.

-Allienating nice friends because I was always cancelling plans or borrowing money and not paying it back.
-Holding on to toxic friendships because they were the people I could always count on to get fucked up with me. 
-Being 12 hours late to my best friends wedding where I was giving a speech because I slept through my alarm and missed my free ride.
-Getting in to relationships with people I didn't want to be with because I would claim to reciprocate their feelings while drunk and then feel guilty when sober.
-Pushing away the love of my life by creating drama when high or being a bitch when coming down.
-Quitting the job I hated on a whim without considering the fact that I had no other income and jobs are sparse in covid-19 Britain.
-Feeling deeply unfulfilled because despite my adventurous nature, I never go anywhere or do anything new as I spend all my spare cash on drugs or impulse taxis or hangover takeaways. 
-Being unhappy with my weight for over 10 years but continuing to gain because of my unhealthy habits.
-Missing important appointments because I'm either high or sleeping it off
-Burning bridges with family members by being resentful and confrontational about old grievances.
-Having issues with people because I say/do offensive things thinking I'm being funny
-Sabotaging a promising new relationship by sending a stream of excruciating texts at 3am. Numerous times.

Any emotionally healthy person would view these sorts of behaviour red flags but because I'm not as bad as I was, I've convinced myself things are fine. I owe myself more than coasting along avoiding both triumph and disaster. I'm intelligent, creative and ambitious yet I've spent 2/3rds of my life unhappy, unfulfilled and underachieving because I chose pills, powder and poison at 12 years old and never deviated.

I don't want the same realisation at 51 that I had at 31. Instead I want to think back to this day as the day I changed my path forever and started living life instead of letting it slip by me unnoticed.",80

2021-05-05 15:44:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n5oor4/i_am_so_sorry/,I am so sorry,"I always drank as much as I could. In high school I drank all the time - before, during, and after school - until I got caught and placed on probation. Dangerous amounts too, enough to keep me bedridden for days on end. I thought I was drinking because I was depressed but really, I just had found alcohol too early and did not how dangerous it was. The alcohol was making me depressed. I thought it was because I was too smart and belonged in a place with more smart people. 

Then I went to college and met you and everything was going so well. I was so happy. I remember writing in my journal one December night freshman year when you had already gone to sleep in my bed about how grateful I was that you happened to come into my life the way that you did and how happy I was. As soon as I could drink again, however, I jumped right back into it. I wasn't depressed now so this time it wouldn't be such a big deal. For most of the rest of freshman year, I didn't have much money so that limited the amount that I could drink. The money that I did have I still spent on booze and cigarettes. 

Ever since I got that job after freshman year, however, I have had thousands of dollars in my bank account at any given moment. I drank as much as I could. I am sure the shit with my dad did not help that summer, but mostly the alcohol was starving my brain of natural dopamine. That summer I even tried benzos for a little while, but they scared the shit out of me and made it hard to get a boner. Everybody drinks, especially the people I admire the most. Creative, smart, ambitious people. I would think 'why can't I be like them? Why can't I stop after one or two fucking drinks? How fucking hard is it to have a modicum of self-control you fucking dumbass? Well, I‚Äôm glad that I finally figured this out. Next weekend I will be much more reasonable. Come on, you‚Äôre a smart guy who works hard, you deserve to relax just like everybody else.‚Äô 

Sophomore and junior year I had to attend class. As much as I prioritized alcohol, I wouldn't let it get to the point where I was missing class and I had to drop out - although I did miss a fair amount of class paralyzed with a hangover. I would drink to the point of blacking out basically Thursday-Saturday every week. Sundays were brutal, debilitating, depressing, made worse by the knowledge that Monday was not going to be much better. By Wednesday I would be feeling better, but regretful over how hard I had been on myself over the past 72 hours. By Thursday evening, I would feel great, energetic, and excited for nothing else more than a cold, delicious drink in my hand to the point of nervous perspiration - I could palpably anticipate the warm wave of positivity and calm that was about to splash over my central nervous system. But it had been a tough week, I told myself I deserved it. 

It had been a tough week. I made every week a battle against nobody but myself. It was exhausting and I allowed it to completely take over my life. I would dream frequently of going to the liquor store and picking up booze. The first time I remember waking up with the horrifying panic of withdrawal was the morning after I went to to that bar by myself. I do not expect you to ever believe me, but it took me years to understand, to actually accept, that all that fear, anxiety, jealousy, paranoia was not some hellish state that fate had chosen for my unfortunate self but the inevitable result of me depriving my body on a weekly basis of the blood-alcohol levels it has grown accustom to enjoying. 

Then COVID came and offered me new opportunities to rationalize getting as sloshed as my heart desired. I was lonely, the world was falling apart, I missed the human contact that I never sought before the pandemic, it didn't matter. I didn't have to get up in the morning, shower, eat a meal, go to class. I suddenly could do what I had always wanted to do before the pandemic, all the time. I drank daily. After a couple weeks, I started to start drinking earlier and earlier until it got to the point where I had to make an effort to keep a few fingers left in the bottle before I passed out so that I had enough to get me up in the morning and go to the liquor store. The weed was great too because it basically numbs your body. After smoking a joint, hangovers that would normally keep me in bed until the early evening were easily overcome by early afternoon. I could drink more than ever. And I did. 

The next time daily panic attacks in the morning started reoccurring was when we went to Montreal. Every morning was hell, and I could not fit enough edibles in my bag to get me through the withdrawal. I actually tried to quit vaping on that trip. Total disaster. After fighting with you for a couple hours, I went to the store around the corner from the restaurant where we were eating at to get the wine for dinner and I picked up some vapes. I felt much better immediately after I did. Then they occurred when we went to visit our friend in Chicago. They were terrible when we went camping in northern Michigan. I vividly remembering the feeling of having all the anxiety and fear that I was experiencing on the drive home ooze out my body as soon as I took a swig and hit the bong after you went to bed that night. It was like cumming, but maybe even better. 

When you're getting as fucked up as I was, you only have a few hours in your week where you are capable performing the psychological tasks that require a sober mind. Exiting that cycle. Leaving the fantasy world that you have created for yourself is horrifying. I do not want to speak for other people, mostly because I still am not even sure if I am capable with all of the support that I am so fortunate to have, but I cannot imagine how someone could do it on their own. Alcoholism is a choice up until the moment that you take your first drink. After that, alcohol is your life until you die or something miraculous happens to make a life without alcohol appear worth living. It's not about simply preventing your hands from unscrewing the lid and raising the bottle to your lips. You have to find a reason not to. A reason to submit yourself to more fear and pain, the fear and pain of withdrawal, than a reasonable mind should ever have to voluntarily subject itself to. And as sad as it is, the love in my life that I cherished most was not enough. The fear, anxiety, self-loathing that I felt for creating misery out of an abundance of joy time and time again precluded myself, in my mind, from deserving love, kindness, calm. If I sensed these things in my life, then they were certainly false. 

I don't even know why I am writing this to you. I told you when we started dating that I was a piece of shit and I proved myself right. I tried so hard to prove myself right. Because if I am a loveless, selfish sack of shit, then the violence that I impose on my body every single night, the violence that I am addicted to, is justified. It makes sense. It‚Äôs a rational response to want to starve a parasite of its nutrients. I don't know why I am writing this. I told you early on that if I stopped making you happy, I wanted you to move on. And that‚Äôs what you did. I should be grateful that you had the foresight to do what my mom never did and identified the misery that a life with someone like me would have entailed. 

Since we first started dating, and probably before our lives even came together, my biggest fear was becoming a sad person who people felt bad for and pitied. Somebody who was loved because somebody had to love them, not because they had ever done anything to deserve it. Someone like my dad. And yet, an outside observer of my life would likely conclude that I have spent years studiously cultivating such an existence. I don't know why. I wish I did, I really do. I don't know how many hours I spent as a kid wondering why my dad couldn't just recognize the plethora of love that sat before him, the love we tried so hard, unfairly hard, to reveal to him. All of our lives - mine, my mom, my brother, my sister, and, of course, my father - would have been so much more pleasant had he just accepted that he was loved. He could have done it any day. He can do it every day. But he hasn't and I do not think he ever will. 

I do not know why he is miserable. His misery is greater than the sum of the sad experiences and regrets that he has accumulated over his years. Sad things happen to people, but, and I don't really know how to describe this, his sadness is just *more*. Its force is unexplainable, at least to me. I see it in my brother and my sister and in myself, but we don't ever talk about it. It‚Äôs like this unspoken badge we all carry with us but never discuss. It‚Äôs a part of me. I see how much it kills my mother when she recognizes it in us, I see in her eyes the guilt of having loved a miserable person and created miserable children, desperately flailing around for the love that they so desperately desire but will never truly accept that they actually deserve. It‚Äôs like the one thing that keeps the three of us going, knowing that if we don't, our mother would no longer be able to tell herself the one thing she relies upon the most to get her through her cruelly unfair world: that her children are happy. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess I just want you to know that I really did love the time that I was lucky enough to spend with you. From the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry about how our time together ended. I wish things could have gone differently but, looking back, I can‚Äôt think of anything that would have stopped me from drinking. I guess for some people, it takes the realization that absent any drastic lifestyle choices they will soon be dead. You can‚Äôt wallow in your self-pity if you're dead, and where‚Äôs the fun in that? If you do not want me to write to you anymore, you can just not respond and I will get the message. 

Sincerely, Your Bug",7

I'm at a loss with what to do here. 

My partner of almost 2 years is a recovering heroin and crack addict. He has been completely clean from drugs for almost 8 months, the longest he's ever managed in his life and certainly in our relationship. I'm so proud of what he has achieved and he has completely got his life back on track since getting clean (paying off debts, getting a new job, repairing relationships with friends and family) 

However, since he has got clean from drugs I noticed his drinking massively increasing pretty much straight away (when he was clean he would drink a fair bit on a night out but other than that not much at all). For the first few months I understood he was having an extremely tough time getting off the drugs and needed to substitute for drink. It seemed to calm down for several months and only recently (last month or so) his drinking has become suddenly extreme. 

He drinks until he is blackout drunk every day without fail, and is not able to just have one or two - if he drinks he is uncontrollable and literally will not stop until all of the alcohol in the house has gone (on an average night I woild say this ranges to a whole pack of beers along with a bottle of wine to as much as a whole bottle of vodka in one sitting).¬† I have never seen him tipsy - if he's drinking then he will make sure he's blackout drunk by the end of the night, it's out if control.

He drinks by himself and is really difficult to be around when he gets drunk - is loud, childish, rude and argumentative and embarrasses me in front of my friends/flatmate. He also often passes out very early each night due to getting blackout drunk and means we never get to spend much time together after work (sex has also been off the cards for a long time as he is always too drunk) 

I have brought up how Im worried about his drinking, and although he said he does agree that its an issue and admits he's drinking because he's not happy (he also constantly jokes that he is an alcoholic), he gets really annoyed when I bring up that I don't like his drinking, says I judge him and make him feel like he can't be himself. He's asked me to 'relax' and let him deal with this his own way. In his words, he told me that nothing is going to stop him drinking and he will deal with it when he's ready. I honestly can't remember the last time he didn't drink for a full day, and whenever we agree to have a sober weekend he goes back on his word without fail. 

We've had a really hard time these past few years and I'm not sure how much longer I can cope with his drinking as it affects our relationship on a daily basis, but I don't want to give up on him after everything we've overcome

Does anyone have advice, or experience in someone getting clean from drugs and then turning to alcoholism? All of this has begged the question for me, do addicts always need 'something' in their lives?

So I have been wondering about this for a while now. I drink from 5 to 8 beers a night, whenever I can afford it.

When I was in high school I clearly had a problem because there were times when my parents found the bottles and hide them and I would loose my shit and flip every piece of furniture in the house trying to find my booze.

Now, when money's a little tight I don't drink, for a few days, sometimes a week, and i'm not desperate for a drink, I just think my night would be better if I was drunk. I also don't wait  all day for the moment when I'll start drinking. 

Both of these facts makes me think I'm ok.

But on the other hand I drink more than almost everyone I know, on a daily basis and I think maybe I'm just finding excuses to not stop?

Hes an angry drunk and always fights with me or says really inappropriate or rude things to me and my friends. But he‚Äôs usually an angel when sober.

At 16 i would drink till i blacked out with friends on those nights when i would drink, I gave up drink when i gave up my peer group and didnt really drink again hard till i went to university at 22.

I noticed i was the heaviest drinker in most groups i was in and no one would black out but me.
I gave up for a few years mostly until i was in my late 20s, i would drink spirits neat straight from the bottle when we went out partying.

Its like whenever i routinely drink it quickly escalates and quitting drinking was the only sensible thing i could do.

When i was around 30 i started drinking every time me  and my ex started fighting which turned into drinking 3 times a week. Around this time i got a bit dependant on alcohol to cope with anxiety.

Now im 38 and during lockdown my drinking escalated to 30 pints a week at which point i realise i have a problem again. Ive cut back to 15 pints a week but its like i cant see myself as an alcoholic as i have successfully quit drinking in the past. But its also clear that the ammount of heavy drinking ive done says i do have a drinking problem.

I find it hard to equate drinking problem with being an alcoholic.

What are your thoughts?",1

He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations ‚Äì all with impulsive, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed. In *Good Will Hunting* he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent. David Itzkoff shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew.

I literally went from a bottle of vodka per week to 2 per day in one month, I had some problem before too but now I was a drunk all the time and I wasn't happy with that. I still was working, I DUI, sometimes I slept in the streets because I could not go home, I already had car accident because I was drunk, I got arrested one time due to public disorder.

2021-05-04 01:21:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n4gqbp/just_need_to_vent/,Just need to vent,"My spouse just retired from the military after a long career, and has likely had at least mild alcoholism the entire time. He has severe PTSD, multiple TBI and has had some great help from the military with these issues. Still, he had two separate issues with being intoxicated at work in his last two years and was fortunate to have been retiring anyway, so they didn't really affect him. They did send him to rehab via the military and he had a few months sober while trying to hold onto his career.

 Depression anxiety and the PTSD are looming large now that he's retired (at 36) and I believe he thought the stress and depression would reside once he was away from the military on a daily basis. They've worsened. He says he drinks so he can just go to sleep and get away from the effects of the PTSD and mental illness. He has a psychiatrist he hasn't been honest with.

He was in the habit of a fifth per day, but would break it up into airline shooters to stay under the radar. He's had periods in the last year where he won't get out of bed except to get more alcohol. He's so incorrigible when he needs more that I get it for him to keep the peace in the house (we have kids). He's also driven drunk to get more, though very rarely. A few months ago after his most recent incident at work, he agreed to go to detox but refused to do any aftercare like rehab or even AA. A few months later and we're right back where we were then, he started drinking again three weeks ago and it's almost as bad as before.

I know I shouldn't go get alcohol for him. But, I also know how dangerous cold turkey, and even tapering at home is. He gets physically sick without alcohol but refuses to go to medically assisted detox again.I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. He's tapered over the last week from two pints of whiskey to one, split into airline shooters so we can monitor then, but I feel like he's ramping back up again. 

I work from home full time, we have kids, dogs... I cannot handle managing his taper, I'm not a medical professional. He can't handle it alone and would rather be left to just drink until he passes out each day. Any discussion of returning to detox is met with him pretending to sleep. I don't know what to do.",5

Drinking history: Started age 16 with friends in high school. Occasionally blacked out. Continued through college and after into my professional career. I can go months without drinking. I can go moths with keeping it in check (show up to parties and not drink or have a few drinks). I can go on dates and have a few drinks and be fine. I can have a beer with a friend and be fine. It's just that every couple of months I will have a night where I will get black out drunk. And I'm in my thirties now. I tend to black out easier than others and think I am a light weight. So I'd classify myself as a binge drinker. Turns out I got my DUI during a blackout (I totaled my car, thank god no one else was involved and somehow I did not have a scratch on me) . Worst thing ever. Career is in jeopardy but apparently I will be fine according to my lawyer and others I have spoke with. Just going to a be a long expensive process with lots of hoops to jump through.

A lot of ppl in AA keep asking me: have you drank yet since your DUI? And my reaction is OF COURSE NOT. I just got a DUI that almost ruined my whole life. I have absolutely no desire to drink. I'm not the type of alcoholic that is physically addicted. I once read there are two alcoholics: those that are addicted to drinking and those that have problems when they drink. I think I am in the latter category. I also have no family history of alcoholism.

So for now I will be doing the AA process and abstaining from alcohol. I actually love my AA meetings and wish I had gone to them years ago. Love the spiritual aspect of it and group therapy. But I was speaking with my therapist today and he was like oh I bet you can be the person that can still have a beer or two with dinner when all this is over. And honestly I believe him. I could even have a beer right now and be fine. Not trying to sound like an arrogant asshole but I sincerely feel that way. But for now I won't drink and continue with the program.

Are there any of you out there with similar drinking history? Did you eventually go back to drinking in moderation? I am totally open to never drinking again. But I also know that I could be someone years from now who is known as the guy who just has one beer. Or one drink. Then calls it quits. Nonetheless I will admit that something horrible like this was bound to happen. This is truly a wake up call for me and I need to go through this painful process. Any advice or stories would be appreciated.",2

You can probably tell from my username (and post history) that I frequent at the dead bedrooms sub ... and if you do happen to look over my history you may notice a reoccurring theme.

I‚Äôm sitting here crying in my car because I have to not only admit that I have a problem with my SO‚Äôs drinking habits but that he actually *does* have a problem.

For a long time I‚Äôve been telling myself that maybe my feelings towards his drinking is unreasonable ... but ... it‚Äôs come to the point where I become upset at the sheer sight of it.

To give you an idea of what his habits are - my SO pretty much drinks whenever he is not working and it‚Äôs pretty much an all day affair. 

When he works - they are 12 hour days and go on for days at a time. So when he gets time off, he will be drinking. And depending on how long of a break - he could go for a few days binge. 

I can barely talk to him because he is either not completely there or asleep. I usually don‚Äôt get real moments with him until it‚Äôs either been after a few days of this and he has finally had enough or after his long work days. 

I have voiced my concerns about this and at one point he wanted me to be his conscious basically. He would ask me, ‚Äúdo you think it would be okay if I drank tonight?‚Äù I was never really entirely comfortable having to be the one to tell him whether or not he could drink, but I tried it for a while. Eventually, it got to me - I feel guilty but I also just felt like it wasn‚Äôt my place ... am I wrong?? 

Anyway ... his drinking is pretty much back to being like it was before. All day affair ... sleeping in between.

He was hungover this morning and I left for an appointment - I was hoping he‚Äôd be sobered up by the time I got home, but I came home to him sleeping on the couch with a drink half drunk sitting at the very edge of the coffee table and I immediately teared up. I told myself to straighten up. I gently said, ‚Äústill sleeping?‚Äù And he huffed ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my day off!‚Äù ... this is when I start to question if I‚Äôm being unreasonable. I was angry, frustrated, questioning myself and I had to just get out of there.

I feel like I can‚Äôt even have true quality time with him sometimes ... okay a lot of the time if I‚Äôm being honest. I‚Äôve also had to make it clear that sex will not be happening while or recently after he has been drinking. That seemed to be the only time he‚Äôd initiate and it‚Äôs become a major turn off and the times I have gone with it I felt horrible afterwards ... 

He doesn‚Äôt think he has a problem... I‚Äôve asked if he‚Äôs depressed ... he says no ... says this is just how he relaxes after a tough gig. 

I‚Äôm not sure of what to do? I could just really use some insight.",4

She was fake sleeping, screamed at me to get out, screamed at him and hit him.

I left immediately, I left all my stuff there including my phone.

I've accepted what I did and that it was wrong. I desperately want to apologise but I can't, and don't want to add them and do so over social media. As far as I know from my friend, their relationship is okay. 

I've also accepted that in recent years any time I've hurt other people or myself is by stupid actions influenced from alcohol. I'm considering becoming sober since I end up drinking too much with friends and doing things I never would. I don't drink alone.

The only people who know is my two friends I went with. I just can't live with the anxiety and guilt and I don't want demons to define me. I feel like I'm a bad person and I'm the only one who hasn't figured that out.

Still don't feel right,"So on Friday, I got a 750 mL bottle of vodka. I took 2 mg of Xanax to loosen me up a little. My last memory before I blacked out was eating dinner (Korean food). When I woke up in the morning, my room was trashed, there was a puddle of urine on the floor, and I was definitely hung over. I go to the kitchen to find the entire bottle of vodka empty. Like not even enough for a single shot left. I had your usual hangover symptoms, headache, nausea, sensitivity to light, etc. The thing is... the symptoms didn't really ever go away. On top of that, I feel extremely slow and my essential tremor is worsened significantly. I've been drinking water round the clock to flush out any ethanol metabolites that might still be floating around in my system.

I have also begun slipping into a very severe major depressive episode. I wake up every morning thinking about suicide. Most of my day is spent in bed (I am also on day 11 of 14 of my mandatory quarantine here in Canada). My mood has been very dark and I can feel the extreme fatigue I normally get when I'm depressed coming on and I have been having extremely vivid nightmares throughout the night. For those of you who are concerned, yes I am getting help, I have a therapist appointment and a psychiatrist appointment next week. I'm just afraid that by drinking so much that one time, I might have done some damage to my brain. I already have some brain damage from an intentional fentanyl overdose (affected my hippocampus and destroyed my memory).

So what do you all think, might these symptoms be the result of alcohol consumption three days ago, or are they more a manifestation of depression?",0

My longest clean time is four weeks. I've had several relapses in the past few months, this shit is hard. I struggle with depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. These overwhelming feelings have been part of my life since I was a child, which is why I turned to dependency on substances. I had already tried cigarettes, weed, and liquor before I tried meds prescribed by a doctor. I'm 39 years old. Two nights ago I wanted to commit suicide so I turned to a beer to slow down the thoughts, and it worked. My cravings are strong tonight but I'm not using anything. That's not true, I'm going to take allergy medicine that makes me sleepy. I went to an AA meeting, had a step one with my sponsor, and did an Al-anon meeting tonight (my partner is an alcoholic). I'm doing everything I can to stay sober, and alive. It's very confusing sometimes. Learning how to let my emotions ride out without substances is the hardest thing I've ever done, harder even than giving birth (emergency C-section, low birth weight baby, and two preemies), harder than leaving my abusive ex, harder than watching my grandmother die. I want a drink so bad right now.",37
2021-05-03 00:26:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n3nt81/is_the_biological_mechanism_that_results_in_dts/,Is the biological mechanism that results in DTs (in response to alcohol withdrawal) the same that produces extremely vivid nightmares?,"I saw a documentary once about people who were so entrenched in alcoholism that they needed medical supervision in order to stop.  Such was the severity of their entrenchment that they could hallucinate while awake  - often they would think spiders were crawling all over them (there was one guy who ended up putting cigarettes out on his body to try and kill them)......

..... My alcohol consumption hasn't been bad enough to produce that sort of response but often I end up getting extremely bad nightmares which seem realler than my waking day. They are extremely vivid, unlike regular dreams they usually have an extremely coherent narrative and they're like waking nightmares in terms of the negative feelings that accompany them (sense of peril, impending doom, thoroughly unsettling).  Years later I can remember them with a clarity better than my memories of  yesterday.  If there was a running theme it would be that a group of strangers are trying to get me and *their faces are always shrouded in darkness*.

  So I'm asking are extremely vivid nightmares an indicator of alcohol withdrawal, like DTs are (albeit at the shallow end of the spectrum)?

  And has anyone here ever had to deal with a withdrawal that's so bad they actually hallucinated spiders crawling all over them?  And what is it about the human psyche that throws up such a common theme in response to alcohol withdrawal?",5

He‚Äôs 32 and his alcoholism has been spiraling out of control for probably about 7 years now. He can no longer hold down a job, is constantly drunk, doesnt eat, and is basically one step away from being homeless.

He got fired from our mutual employer last October for being drunk at work (it wasnt the first time and they wanted to work with him). He then went unemployed all winter and took a new job recently, out of state, growing weed.

The weed farm fired him 5 days ago for being drunk at work and physically caught him drinking out of a handle of whiskey at 9am. The fucking weed farm reached out to me! Theyre worried about.

Ive ignored this long enough. I know he needs to want to make a change. But Im his best friend and Im trying to take some steps towards helping him. I have talked to him about his problem, but its not enough. He needs professional help now.

Fortunately, my employer/his ex-employer is very understanding. My boss lost a close friend to alcoholism not long ago. He‚Äôs letting me take time off of work to deal with this. It makes sense to do so because I work in a different city than where I and my friend live.

So my friend got fired a few days ago and is slowly road-tripping home. I am in contact with him. He was supposed to return tonight, now it‚Äôs tomorrow night... whatever, Im here waiting for him. Ive contacted what remains of his friends. I have somewhat of a team willing to help. Sounds like an intervention isnt recommended anymore?

My thought is to just be there for him and talk to him when he arrives home, BUT i also want some treatment options prepared/turn-key ready. I know he‚Äôs been to AA before. IMO he needs to detox. Im really rooting for an in-patient option. Fortunately, money isnt much of a factor.

Where the hell do I start? The local hospital? Google? How do I find some treatment options for him?",2

When he drinks he piss in his pants, blackout drunk and his personality just change drastically (not in bad way). He would tell me stories on how he would blackout drunk and one time went to a gay bar with someone number but he swears he is straight.

He ALWAYS wants to wrestle.

He always opens up about his past but at the same sentence he will shut down and avoid talking about his personal trauma. He will express how much he value me as a friend and he actually let me hug him when his at this point again on the flip side he will constantly say ""I am not gay"" over the most stupid things. 

One point he talked about suicide next minute he is hitting me lightly me and begging me not be mad at him when he say offensive things.

I don't know what exactly what issues he is dealing with but I want to help him because I am not much of a drinker. So sobriety is something I can help but he wants a drinking buddy so I will drink with him until he get plaster. I usually sober because I hate the aftereffect of drinking so I seen his drunk side a lot more he has seen mine. 

I don't know what to do with him when he is drinking again",3

Well, I have been drinking heavily for years now, but most recently a year ago it picked up really bad. I can kill about a half gallon a day before I black out, then my consumption is a mystery.

However, I have recently noticed that my bladder hurts so bad, and urinating hurts. It's painful, even to the point of tears sometimes. When urinating, I can have a ton of liquid and only a small amount will come out, gradually throughout the hour. Each time it hurts. My stomach is large and swollen. I'm a female, 21, for context if that matters?

I just want to hear from other people if they've experienced something like this. I don't want to go to urgent care because I really just can't afford it.

Thanks, all!


Update: At urgent care now, just doing the long wait game... I hope the results are good! Still having the same symptoms, so hopefully they can tell me something and get this thing solved.",1

I'm writing this post slightly hungover after a night of drinking with my friends. I'd say around 6-7 drinks total. I feel pretty crappy and am upset that I have wasted the day. I don't really know what I'm trying to say in this post, but I guess just the fact that I've gotten to this point of being upset with myself for drinking too much so often. I always say I am going to cut back, drink slower, know my limits, etc., but it never seems to account to more than me saying that the next day after drinking.

To put things into context, I'm a 21 year old college student, who started drinking when I was around 15 years old. I loved alcohol since the first time I got drunk. In high school, I would binge drink like crazy, somehow my young body, I guess I could drink like 9-12 drinks and wake up fine the next morning. Even then though, I would drink to the point where I was hysterical, like crying, getting into arguments, being overly sexual, causing drama, and just being such a nuisance. And the sad thing is I am still like that today. I feel like I never got to the stage where I could ""handle my liquor"" and I think it's because I just can't stop once I start drinking.

I feel like half the times I drink I get too drunk and embarrass myself. Putting on top of that, the past year, my hangovers have been so crazy and debilitating. Also during my freshman year of college, I got so drunk going out one night that I passed out at a bar and woke up at 6am in the hospital to my mom sitting next to me. To make things worse, I was like flirting with these guys at that bar, in front of my boyfriend, and later asked this girl if she wanted to have sex. (I don't recall any of this) I remember being so shocked and confused the next morning, wondering how the hell things got that bad. I was really upset at myself for the weeks following, but no lasting change has been made since then. I still get way too drunk and will black out on occasion. I've gotten so drunk to where I've made like grown men strangers want to fight me because of rude things I've said. Another time I got so drunk while traveling, that I blacked out for ten hours and woke up and got told I had sex with some random stranger in a club and almost got arrested for being drunk in public. (again I don't remember any of this) As I'm writing this out I'm cringing so hard and kind of in shock at how bad this all sounds. There are so many other occasions of just being such an annoying and awful person, that I wake up sooo upset at how terrible I was acting and am pretty much depressed the next day. I try and just brush this stuff off I think?? By saying like oh I'm just fun, or at least I'm not a boring drunk... which doesn't make any sense!!

Anyway, I definitely am a binge drinker. I only drink of weekends and have gone like a few weeks to a month without drinking over the past couple years. I almost never drink alone, though I have started drinking like a singular beer on occasion by myself. Especially during the start of the pandemic last year, I went like two months without drinking. It's just once I start, like I said, I can't stop. I've tried in the past to come up with ""rules"" to follow to not get too drunk, but they never seem to work. I literally wrote them out in my iPhone notes the day after an embarrassing night drinking. For example, counting drinks, water between every drink, no shots, no liquor, just beer, no drinking games, having something to do with my hands like rolling cigs or something, drinking a nice nonalcoholic drink throughout the night, etc. etc. But once I start drinking, all cares go out of the window.

I don't want to give up drinking though. Like I want to be able to go out to dinner and drink a couple glasses of wine with my friends, or just have a cocktail, or a few beers at a party etc. And the times I do accomplish this controlled drinking, it's great! I feel like I'm fun to be around and I have fun myself. It's just there's always the chance of everything going to shit and out of control. I also am so scared of getting too drunk and saying or doing something terrible and like literally ruining my life or the relationships I have with people.

I think the friends I tend to gravitate towards like to party and are kind of wild. I don't really feel like I want friends that don't drink?? I've gone to my best friend in the past when I was upset with my drinking, and she kind of just brushed it off saying we're young and it's fine and just spinning the whole thing as something funny. I'm not mad at her or anything. Honestly, she's pretty similar to me in her drinking habits.

Regarding myself, besides drinking, I am well rounded. I get straight A's, I work a part time job, I spend time with my family, I try and do hobbies. I'm also usually a happy person. I have mild anxiety, but I'm not depressed or anything. I want more close relationships and find it difficult to make closer friendships, but I don't really see how alcohol would play a role into that problem. If anything, drinking with people makes becoming friends/closer a lot easier I think.

Well anyway, I'll stop rambling now. I guess it you've read all of this, what do you think from an outside perspective? Can I drink in moderation? How do I stop coming to this point again and again where I'm fed up and upset with myself and wanting change but never actually changing anything? Writing this out it kind of seems like the only logical step would be to give up alcohol, but I really, really don't want to do that, at least right now while I'm so young.",5

I have a question; my partner has recently started his journey in trying to wrangle his alcoholism. He hasn't decided to set the goal as abstinence, as he views that as not having control anymore, which, y'know. I don't fully agree, but he is his own adult.

He was doing really well, reducing his drinking from three bottles of vodka to just three bottles of wine a day. He was on a great trajectory for so long, but he seems to have stalled out at three bottles of wine. Recently, he began buying hard alcohol again and has been finishing that.

Is this a normal part of recovery? Is it a relapse if he's never stopped drinking? I don't have a lot of experience with alcoholism. I'm trying to support him, but it's really difficult not to become that nag. I've backed off since he doesn't want to discuss his recovery with me (and I agree that I can't really handle it that well). Any advice or stories or anything really would be appreciated.

He works hard and runs his own business, and since I‚Äôve been pregnant, he‚Äôs been working long days with the goal of buying a place for us to nest and raise a baby.

He explained the situation, she‚Äôs very drunk and combative, but they would like to not take her in if it can be helped. I confirmed it was her home (she had also lost her ID and keys). After chatting for a while, I over hear my friend get up, walk in her home, and slam the door. At that point the cops allowed me to walk away from them while I tried banging on my friends door and calling her name and asking her to let me in. No answer by friend, so I assumed she passed out. I went back home to continue my tv show after Calling her boyfriend and asking him to check in on her. 
Around 2 am, I get another call. This time from her roommate and her boyfriend. My friend, in a manic drunk rage has broken every window in her home, she has pulled out a gun (with a bullet in the chamber) threatened to kill her self and them. They had wrestled the gun away and called her dad. Her dad living across the county from us, is asking for me to call him. So I give him a call and explain everything I know up to this point. He begs me to go and check on her, thinking the two boys (boyfriend and the roommate) are lying or something. I tell him no, and hang up. 

About 10 mins later, I reconsider, worrying that I may be the only one to be able to calm her down. I truly love my friend and want nothing bad to come of her. I was scared about the gun thing. I drive back over. It‚Äôs close to 2:30 when I arrive. 

When I arrive, both boys are standing out side the house and my friend is screaming through a door window (that she busted out, sharp glass everywhere). She‚Äôs in total hysteria. She sees me and calls me every name in the book and says I abandoned her. She tells me to kill myself and hopes death in me. I told her the cops are going to get called because she‚Äôs out of control. I ask where the guns are. Her boyfriend shows me them, he was able to get them and the bullets. I tell him to go hide them. 
Moments later, cops show up again. My friend is in a fit of rage screaming. I explain that she‚Äôs usually not like this. We all tell them she has busted out the windows, she‚Äôs bleeding from that. My friend tells the cops I abandoned her and for me to go to hell. After the cop gets caught up, as I know the most about the situation (from the first instance of the initial cop call at least), I ask if I am free to go. They let me leave, I go home. 30 mins later I get a call from her roommate saying she was taken to the drunk tank for the night. 

I‚Äôm furious of course. I‚Äôm just a mom, I don‚Äôt drink like that (rarely maybe a few times a year I get actually drunk, and never to the point of blacking out or passing out etc). My friend keeps hanging out with a group of girls who I would call bar flys and when she does she comes home loaded and does something dumb (never this extra). She called me today to apologize, worried that I have dropped her from my life. I told her I love her and that I wouldn‚Äôt drop her but she did hurt me and I don‚Äôt want her to drink any more. We make plans to meet tomorrow. She also told me at the bar last night, she went into bathroom with a guy and he gave her cocaine, but she can‚Äôt remember if she snorted it or ate it. I feel like she must‚Äôve been given something else, like maybe Xanax? How would she fly off in a fit of delusional rage like that. 

Tomorrow, I plan to tell her that if she is to continue in my life she needs to go to treatment, or at minimum join AA. I really think she needs a treatment program though. She‚Äôs been seeing a therapist, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping with the alcohol abuse. She‚Äôs had several scary close calls over the last year, and she says she wants to stop drinking. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone would have words of wisdom on how I should go about this conversation. I will never answer a cop call for her again. I was at one point very worried for my safety, the others there, and of course my friends.",1

I have always been confused how a healthy mind views alcohol because houses of friends and family will have alcohol sitting in a cabinet, shelf, or on the kitchen counter for months untouched. This is not a concern or event, simply the equivalent of having toilet paper in a cupboard. It has astonished me my whole life because if you put a bottle in my vicinity it will not be sloshing by the end of the night. 

I have been tryin to figure out some way for me to empathize with a healthy understanding because I cannot comprehend it. The best analog I could find in my own life is a bag of weed that I have sitting on top of my dresser beside a vaporizer. This bag has been untouched for over a year because I simply am not a fan of marijuana. Yet, there are people who will scrounge around to get a last nugget or smoke roaches because they are desperate to get high. My disinterest must astound them. 

I believe that this must be somewhat similar to how the average person views alcohol, something they bring out for parties but in everyday life could take or leave. For me this is an eye-opening perspective because it exposes just how obsessed I really am and calls into question whether I have ever had a healthy relationship with alcohol or have been consumed by it from my first drink.

I have a question and am not sure i this is the right place for it, so please let me know if not.

I've drank socially a lot in my life, but never grappled with true alcoholism. I might have 1 beer if I'm alone with dinner, but never more. It's mainly social drinking, but less so now than when I was younger... because my body.

Recently I've noticed a strange new occurrence where I'll have \~3 drinks socially, and then a series of 3-5 days will follow where I feel noticeably depressed (lower than by baseline depression). I won't really have a physical hangover, but then maybe a day after drinking, I'll start to get these spikes downward where I just feel really worthless and empty. Like my chest hurts and I want to cry type stuff.

Then after that period I return to baseline.

I'm coming out of the pandemic having been very very isolated... which I'm thinking might account for it, but I'm really not sure. Maybe it's not the alcohol at all... I'm dealing with a lot of other life problems (aren't we always)... but these particular spikes seem to be connected with having a few drinks.

But it seems incongruous based on the amount I've drank and my life experience prior - I'd get a bit sad sometimes but it didn't feel this pronounced.

Any feedback or insight is much appreciated!",19

2021-05-01 14:41:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/n2ohm1/my_relationship_with_booze/,My relationship with booze,"My mum's an alcoholic. I probably first started noticing that she had a drinking problem maybe when I was 15 or so when there wouldn't be a night when she didn't have a drink in her hand. It started becoming a problem when I was 17 and mum and dad split. Alcohol was mums crutch throughout the divorce and she started to have binging sessions each evening. She would yell, hit us, slur speech and passout on the couch. I moved in with my grandparents to go to uni not long afterwards and my relationship with my brother and sister deteriorated because I left them. 
Throughout uni I would binge maybe once or twice a week and have a good time dancing at pubs and clubs with friends. 
I then finished uni and joined a company that values the work hard play hard lifestyle. I love this company, the perks, the people and my team. Any work function  throughout the last 5 years I have drunk at, many times excessively and because of this I've made a fool of myself, vomitted, been kicked out of venues and had some really shitty hangovers the next day. I've been embarrassed, felt deep shame, apologised to countless people, laughed it all off and repeated the same behaviours next time.
Throughout the pandemic, work functions have been more sporadic and with this I've been reflecting on my behaviours. 
I want my future kids to have a healthier relationship with alcohol. I want to be able to go out and have a good time without relying on booze. I want to be able to have a glass and stop. I want to be able to say no to just one more.",3

  I'm very recently trying total cessation.  For years and years if I don't drink I wake up drenched in sweat and sometimes it's so bad my clothes are sticking to me and I have to sit in front of a heater so I don't get a chill.  I didnt even realise this might be a symptom of having too much booze until relatively recently (I just thought it was because I drank too much water before bed). 

  Right now it's a Saturday night and I'm planning on stopping up all night just to avoid waking up Sunday morning absolutely drenched and being unable to shower clean afterwards (shouldn't be too tricky, I have lots of modafinil).

But after that I'm back in work and so I'll need to sleep and it's not really feasible to have a bath in the morning.  Anyone got any body hacks to minimise the sweating?

I have a friend of mine for over 10 years now who has been batteling alcohism for the past year or so. It started late 2019, than proceeded to get much worse after he had his newborn and the pandemic.

It went from simply hanging out on a weekend for a few beers than myself catching him drinking every day. There has been various occasions while behind the wheel as well. 

From what I have seen, he follows patterns (gets very problematic,  something dramatic happens or health issues arise,  goes back to being sober for a month than repeat). He would stop smoking than go back to that as well to. 

We're in our 20s and I know maturity hits everyone differently. He likes to live in the past, despite having a family now and he pushing himself away from his family and his love ones. He doesn't work (under the table when it works for him) and always had a free pass for a lot in life.

At this point it following the same old routine with us. I have been very supportive with him, sticking around when things got rough but I'm at a point where I am looking for help for trying something different approach or any advice if anyone is in a similar situation.

I wish I could see it in his shoes, as I get frustrated whenever he cleary is on the right path but than decides to opt out when things get rough. He's a brother to me, just want to see if I can try something different.

I was clean from all substances for 115 days then relapsed last night. Drank a six pack of beer and half a bottle of wine, I also took a shit load of ritalin (120mg or so). Last drink and last bump of ritalin was about 3-4 hours ago. Consumed all of it within 8 hours or so. When I was heavily drinking a few months ago I would get very severe withdrawal symtpoms. I haven't taken ritalin in years, never abused it like this either, I took it as prescribed (I flushed what was left btw before anyone asks). This is also my first relapse after a prolonged period of abstinence. The thing is, I'm feeling like I have mild withdrawal symptoms. Is this possible, after only one night of drinking? Is this because I used to be so physically dependent on it? Or is it the ritalin + hangover making me feel this way? I would have thought the ritalin would be out of my system tho? I snorted it, and it's been close to 4 hours. I've tried googling and I can see that withdrawal will come sooner if you have struggled with withdrawal symptoms before but I wasn't expecting THIS quick.
