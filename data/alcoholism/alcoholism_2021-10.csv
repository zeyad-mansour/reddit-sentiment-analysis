Nothing from Tuesday around 3 until Thursday around 11am where I had a 12 pack  of beers spaced out (never got really drunk) and then a few glasses of wine sipped on to take the edge off on Thursday, about the same friday. Not much, no more than 2 or 3 glasses throughout the day, not a glass at a time, just a sip here and there.

 I had some withdrawal symptoms, a lot of anxiety,  a lot of night sweats Tuesday night and a lot of insomnia and high heart rate, which is normal when I’m anxious anyway. Never had any tremors or puking.

I felt pretty good most of yesterday, I feel great today other than a minor anxiety spell. My heart rate is lower and no other symptoms.
I always get really anxious after drinking anyway, so my symptoms may have been more anxiety, particularly anxiety about withdrawal.

He's openly an alcoholic and he does not want to change at all. We've been together for over 3 years, but married for 1 and a half. 

During this time I saw the true extent of his alcoholism and I even think I allowed it to become worse (as I'm the only one who drives and I drive him to and from the store to get copious amounts of booze every two weeks).

I, personally, hardly ever drink and started drinking even less because I'm always in charge when he can't handle things anymore.

Our relationship is strained because of his alcoholism, but today he left sober to walk the dog and barely made it back home. When he got back, his pants were dirty so he must have fallen, he couldn't even lock the door because his sight was so blurred. I asked him questions, which he refused to answer and went to sleep at 6 pm.

For a long while my husband has had an issue with alcohol. He had a good job, we have a lovely house, a wonderful child, two dogs. On the surface we have it all. But it hasn’t been enough or maybe it’s too much I don’t know. My husband is not a nice drunk (condescending, argumentative and on occasion violent if you make the mistake of trying to stop him) and our life together ended up reduced to him getting home from work me putting our daughter to bed him sitting drinking In front of the TV until he passed out then him walking at 11pm or midnight crashing around making dinner for himself before drinking some more and literally stumbling to bed. It broke me. There was no reasoning no understanding. No place I wouldn’t find hidden empties or event that wouldn’t get ruined by his teenage behaviour when drunk. 

He wanted me to help him and I feel so bad I had to refuse but I know him. I know that it wasn’t going to change. He drove our child still under the influence to school. That isn’t the man I loved or married. But it’s never the drink that is the problem. It’s something else. Or ‘I just don’t understand that it isn’t really that much’. Or that he doesn’t drink at 9am and goes to work so there isn’t a problem apart from in my own head. I have seen him lie so many times. To family, to friends to the police even to our marriage counsellor. For so long I thought I drove him to it. That if I was better or perfect then he wouldn’t need to do it anymore. But I just cannot live with the fear what I will find next another empty bottle of vodka/gin/whiskey stashed away when I thought it was getting better. It all seems pretty rats right now trying to separate our lives and not damage our child. He still thinks it is me with the issue and maybe it is. But I don’t think it is wrong to want more. I don’t know where I am going with this maybe I just need someone to tell me that it was okay to put my child and myself first even thought I vowed for better or worse. I just don’t trust him anymore and even if he turned it around I don’t think I ever could again. I would always be watching snd waiting. He was my everything once and I never thought it would end up here but all I feel is relief. May be if you have advice on how to make separation and divorce not a trigger for even more drinking but I doubt that is possible.

If it was emptiness, then there would be nothing in there becasue it is empty. But, for me it is legit like despair at the core of my being. It does not feel like I do not have an identity or as if I am dissociating...just a very very very deep and profound sadness.

My dad drove him to the hospital last night at midnight and spent five hours with him until he got checked in. He’s got 72 hours and then the plan is for him to go away for 6 months (I say “the plan is” because in the back of my mind is the saying “You make plans and God laughs”) 

I don’t think it’s really hit me yet. I had in my mind that by now we‘d be living together and fixing up our house, but life happens.

The hardest part about it is the tough love aspect. My body and my heart tell me to comfort and console him, but my mind tells me that he has to he the one to walk this path and that I can’t do it for him. 

My own mental health has taken a hit worrying about him and even my physical health to an extent (my body responds strongly to stress and last month my period was almost 10 days late). It hit my last night that in trying to cover and care for him I’ve put myself and my own well-being on that back burner. 

He’s been given the tools and now it’s up to him to use them. The same goes for me-I’m making plans to see my old therapist again and am thinking of attending an Al-Anon meeting myself. I want to take this time to get myself back to a good headspace. 

It’s hard right now. When we started dating and he told me about his past addictions and struggles it was easy to look past them because he was doing so well at the time. Now it’s real and tangible. It’s staring me down in the face and I can’t ignore it anymore. 

I’m forcing myself to take things one day at a time. Some days it’s 15 minutes at a time. I’m learning to be gentle with myself and to not blame myself for his addictions and his struggles-he’s a grown man and it’s not my fault that it got this far.

To get you in context he is a 28yo adult, he lives by himself and apparently he is a highly functional alcoholic since he use to drink on weekends. He refuses to go to anonymous alcoholics and he is under psychiatric treatment since also struggles with depression, PTSD, anxiety among other diagnosis.

I've tried to help him as it's on my hands but this night it went so far and he hit my husband while he was driving to take him to his apartment. We lost completely the control of the situation and I ended in confrontation against him. I told him things that in other circumstances I would tough twice before. I feel like I've lost his trust and it concerns me a lot.

I feel lost, it hurts as hell. I can't stop thinking on he can commit suicide. He had tried it several times and now he wouldn't ask me for help or companion. My family is dysfuncional and all these years I decided to take a kind of mother role with him but I can't do it anymore. I'm completely broken heart and I can't see things clearly.

I will look for professional help of course.

I don't really don't know what it's my purpose of writing this, maybe some of you got something from your family to do it better, maybe you have an advice or maybe you have a point of view that I wasn't able to realize from my place.

I still did K here and there after that, and every single time my kidneys just refused to work after a gram or so, sometimes even way less than that. Thing is, I knew exactly what was going on and what the culprit was, but it being Covid and all and me being unemployed in a new city and trying to make it in SoCal with no job for 14 months with easy access to drugs on credit equaled a lot of irresponsible decisions. I believe I have irreparably damaged my organs though, until yesterday, my labs have consistently come back normal, save a cyst on my left kidney that my doctor assures me is nothing to worry about. Anyway so now there is this liver damage indicated on my most recent labs, and even though I know continuing to drink is making things worse, you know what… I just don’t have any healthy coping mechanisms at all, that’s just the long and short of it.

I always try to look at the bright side of things no matter how hard it may be so I guess 4 1/2 months is a big accomplishment and I should be proud.  But tbh it is hard to be proud.  When I got sober, honestly I did not get sober because I wanted to, I got sober because I needed to.  My gi system was so messed up and the anxiety attacks were so severe I ended up going to the hospital.  Its been 4 1/2 months and although the anxiety has subsided a bit and is not severe the gi problems are still ruining my life.  I was an alcoholic for a little over a year \~463 days and I have been sober for over 130...but I still feel awful.  I've gotten an endoscopy and a gastric emptying study and both are normal.  I have a colonoscopy next month and I am starting to think that is going to come back normal and all my symptoms are just severe ibs.  I've tried everything and I won't get into all that but believe me I have and I am barely even of legal age to drink and I work out a good amount and eat right but my body is still showing little signs of recovery.  My girlfriend of two years left me during my battle with sobriety because the effects alcoholism took on my body and personality caused her to lose hope in me and break up with me the day before our two years.  My friends are starting to give up on me and no one even knows I was an alcoholic and all these problems are stemming from that.  Not my friends or my ex girlfriend or my family.  I feel so guilty that I have put them through this and there is this big dark secret I have somehow managed to hide from all them.  I am graduating in December from college a half a year before all of my friends and I am couped up in my room in pain a lot of the time.  I never go out and I cannot have fun or enjoy my life, I only like sleeping.  My neighbors right now are having a party and they go out all the time, my friends are all out and talking about all the exciting plans and parties they are going to attend for halloween, all my friends from high school are out drunk and I see all the stories they have on snapchat, my ex is going home to go out to bars twice this weekend, and me... well I am struggling to go to class, barely getting B's or C's when I usually make Dean's List and how am I celebrating 21? Well looking forward to a colonoscopy I guess with the small chance that maybe there will be some answers provided in that.  I feel like I have lost my life and I have fallen into a huge depression.  I really only like being asleep these days as everyday is a whirlpool of gi problems and struggles.  I wish I never drank and I wish I could have my life back.  I am sorry to all of you for this ""boo who my life is so bad"" rant and I feel guilty for even typing it out because I know how hard alcoholism is too conquer and I know that I have many blessings and my story is nothing to the hardships many of you brave people have faced.  But thank you for going on this journey with me you all are my only outlet I have that I can say and share all of these problems with.  Thank you.  If any of you have gone through similar bouts of ibs-c symptoms when drinking and first going sober I would love to hear how long it took for your gi system to start working like usual again I could use some hope that if I am just patient and keep doing healthy things in 1 month, 3 months, 6 more months etc. I will feel normal again.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73554575}"

My (40m) father (62) has always been a functioning alcoholic. Never really caused problems. Basically spent his life working 12 hour days, coming home and drinking til he passed out. Didn't bother anyone and provided for his family so we let him be.

This last year has been very difficult though. He lost his father and sister and business also he physically can't work anymore but keeps trying.  This has led to more and more alcohol. My mom told me and I worried but didnt think much of it other than his health.

However, a few weeks ago, he was building a table for a client (he no longer has his business but keeps in contact with clients to try to make money) and he ended up breaking a custom table top stone that costs about 4k. He can't repay that. Then a few days later while driving home he hit a car. He swears he wasn't drunk, but apparently he stopped and presented his insurance and DL, but he kept insisting that it was her fault in such an aggressive way that she said they should call the cops, he told her she has his info so he isn't waiting around and left. So I'm thinking he was drinking. he isn't an angry person.

My brother (28) and I went over last weekend to tell him these things are going to fall on us financially since he cant pay for them. So we told him we arent going to allow him to work anymore. We told him we would support hijm and make sure he is taken care of because that would be more financially feasible than paying for 4k rocks and car accidents. He agreed (but I'm sure you know he really didn't).

Well today my mom called me and said she woke up and he was already drunk. This has never happened before. He then argued with her about it and took her car keys and left. 30 min later he walked up to the house with some donuts and locked himself in his room. She has no idea what happened to the car.

I'm scared. I'm sad. I don't know what to do. I can take th ecar away, but my mom wouldn't have a way to move around and would be stuck in the house with whatever it is he is becoming. I'm sure it is going to get much worse and am preparing myself for anything but am looking for advice form others who have had similar issues. Thanks",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.665139}"

It means I threw up 20-30% of the time.

After much experimenting and research   I came up with this process which I followed to a T. I knew when I woke up the next morning that I would need to throw up.
This was to avoid the taste of acid/poison and to quicken and smoothen the process of elimination. 

I felt nauseous. I felt headache.  I felt my stomach bloated.  My sleep quality was so low I could barely wake up.

This was the process. 

I would alwaysv keep a 2 litere of diet coke or Pepsi f not already in the house.

After I woke up I would boil water and put some ginger in it with some sugar. Let it cool down for 5 minutes and slowly drink
 It was barely a cup of it.

Once down for 30 minutes   I would slowly start drinking the diet coke . As I drank glass  by glass. I would stretch myself so that my stomach would stretch and the coke could go down as much as possible.
I would do a movement similar to hulahoo so that my stomach contents would mix with the diet coke.
This went on for 30-45 minutes as my stomach bloated a little bit more.

After chugging about 1.5 litres of coke , I would walk a little bit with some stretching and hulahoo stretch.
10 minutes after this, I would massagey tummy nicely ( gently ) all over and proceed to the toilet. Lift the lid up. 
I was ready. Washy hands and 4 fingers in the back of the throat. 

Gag reflex and the whole poison would come out. Rinse repeat.  Sometimes have to drink more coke.
The headache would reduce by 80 % for some time.  Once I was sure the poison was out , I would dissolve Alka seltzer extra in 7 Oz of water and drink up.

Once this was done I would try to sleep.  Most of the times I would fall asleep in 30 minutes. Sometimes 60.

When I wake up, stomach not as bad as before. Face didn't look ugly as before. Sleepmfelt better amf most importantly the thought of what to drink later would cross my mind. 

Cheers with water. 

Now after being sober   it's really difficult to throw up if I feel something is wrong with the food or the tummy. It is impossible.  I think I threw up maybe once or twice in  the last 5 years.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5158997}"

I am a sober person due to a medication that I take that makes me very ill now if I drink at all. I’ve never had substance abuse issues. 

Basically my bf has planned for months to go this party at his best friend and wife brother in laws house. It’s far away so he’s wanting to spend Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday there. He really wants me to be there the entire time which I totally understand. 

The thing is when he and his bestfriend get together the drinking is extremely out of control. I mean all day and all night, more than 30 beers each and more than 15 shots each of alcohol. Basically until they both black out and then some. 

Since I can’t drink it isn’t much fun to be surrounded by extremely drunk people. I initially asked to go but as the date gets closer I realized I’m gonna have to be the only sober person the entire weekend. The party on Halloween will be a big one and I’ve never met anyone there besides the three people mentioned. It’s really the party that I’m not wanting to go to. I’ll probably feel pretty socially anxious and sorta bored that night. 

I tried to test the waters by saying I might have to work that Saturday and just hangout Friday. It was met with him being extremely bummed out and wanting me to call in sick at all costs.

I accept that he’s an alcoholic and I love him very much. We have established boundaries in place with his drinking that he doesn’t cross and he’s very open about it with me. We have a good relationship and I’m there for him when he does occasionally heavily binge nightly. This is a one off event. I know that these boundaries aren’t in place when he’s with his bestfriend and I’m totally okay with that. 

I don’t want to be a stick in the mud and he seems dead set on me going to this whole weekend affair. I’m okay with being there a night with just a few people but I don’t think I’ll enjoy the whole four days and the huge party. 

How do I break it to him that I don’t want to go? I don’t want to make him feel bad about his drinking. I also don’t think he understands what it’s like to have to be sober around everyone else.

I've always been a picky, inconsistent eater as a child and suffered from iron deficiency anaemia in the past. As an adult I've become much less picky, but the problem is that I don't care much for food and feel like it's a burden and imposition to have to eat. I eat to not feel the pain of hunger. That's it.

I struggle to get enough calories, which is a problem, because I exercise a lot. Last year, when I was running the equivalent of two and a half marathons a week, I ended up incurring a bone stress injury because I wasn't eating enough calories. The sports doctor even asked if I was anorexic, because you usually only see those types of injuries in anorexic people.

Part of the lack of calories is because I eat a largely plant based diet, obviously extremely fibre rich and lower calorie. Meat is a highly calorific food, and I love it, but I can't in good conscience eat it anymore because I don't want to cause unnecessary suffering to animals, nor cause the environmental damage. Sometimes I will go back and eat meat but I can only eat it for a few days before I feel sick and gross and stop again.

Multiple food allergies also restrict my diet even further - allergy to wheat protein (but *not* gluten, funnily enough) being the main one.

So I often find myself turning to alcohol as a way to stimulate my appetite, because otherwise I just don't feel like eating, really. I know alcohol is bad and I would really rather be able to find an alternative. Does anyone else have this problem?

What is sleep paralysis.  Sleep paralysis is when you feel paralyzed during sleep but are awake. You try to get up or move your body or scream or do anything. But you cannot you just cannot. It is extremely scary. You actually think that you have lost control of your body and you will.be in this state for the rest of the life.
You feel so helpless.

Snoring is when you take in the air through the mouth.  You make a big funny noise which disturbs others.  A friend of mine used to wake up due to his own Snoring.  That's hoe loudest can be. Extremely unhealthy as the quality of the sleep is below par..you are taking in the air from mouth instead of nose.

My dad does.

I'm 26 I've been drinking pretty much every day of my life (Multiple 40oz of Steel Reserve 211 a day). I've worked intense physical labor jobs for most of my 20's. I've had an issue with my feet always hurt and feeling sore, even when waking up. I always chocked it up to working my body so much but even when I would rest all weekend it would always hurt as if I just got home from a long shift. I started to think it was the alcohol but I never cared enough to stop drinking. But earlier this year I left my job and I decided to spend a couple months just chilling and resting my body because I had the money to do so and I went full lazy mode just drinking and chilling but my feet were still hurting weeks even months later as if I still just getting home from a long shift at work.

About 2 or 3 months ago I decided to quit drinking and I was hoping one of the things that would approve was my leg and feet. In fact that was actually one of the reasons why I finally decide to quit drinking everyday was mostly because of how bad my feet were hurting especially after I started a new job. My feet have not improved not that I'm aware of and I've been sober for quite a while now and a lot of other things have approved still got the blues though and my joints hurt but digestion and whatnot has improved. But as soon as I wake up, just jarring foot pain.

I am almost 24. I like to think I've stopped my problem drinking. I have better control of my emotions. But those 3 years of problem drinking have really caught up with me now. And now it feels like a much more physical addiction.


I don't think I can realistically go a week without drinking unless I were in a rehab. I try not to drink whiskey anymore. I switch to wine/beer whenever I feel I need a break. I dont drink every day. 


I wouldn't consider this a ""problem"" but I know I'm well on my way to having one. Alcoholism was very normal in the town I grew up in. So to me, I dont feel like I'm drinking that much even?

my father passed away from alcoholism very suddenly on august 20th (he died in a car crash leaving detox, emts think he crashed because he was having a seizure or stroke from DTs). i was going through a long-term breakup at the exact same time. i quickly became suicidal and ended up at a psych hospital where they told me i needed addiction treatment and i finally decided to listen. 

something about this time is different. i think this is the longest i’ve been sober in my adult life and i go to multiple meetings a day, have a sponsor, and am working on step one. i’m ignoring the people in my life who are telling me i “don’t need” this and i “wasn’t that bad of an alcoholic” because i know enough about this disease to be fucking terrified of it and i don’t think any harm ever came from being sober. i’ve always told myself i would get sober “eventually” and would just “be young and have fun” until then, but i know only good can come to me from sobriety so why not do it now. 

but with the pain of losing my dad, losing my partner and my home and my pet, and now making the conscious decision to let go of pretty much every thing else in my life (my old job bartending, my old “friends” i know aren’t healthy for my recovery or growth), and my old coping mechanisms, i feel like i’m being eaten alive everyday. i have really beautiful moments sometimes but i quickly return to near debilitating fear, loneliness, and depresssion. i am so fucking sad and scared. it’s so hard not to feel sorry for myself or like god has abandoned me at best or is spiting me at worst. sometimes i really don’t know how i’m going to get through this or if i’m making the right decision doing this now on top of everything else.

I was alone at home ona friday. I drank 8-10 beers. Did  not eat .slept away.
All week I was drinking and not feeling good. A sense of upset stomach. Something was amiss but I kept drinking.  
I actually thought that I could keep drinking every day all my life and would have fun every day. It never dawned on me the harm I was causing to my body.

Saturday morning I woke up to a headache. I got some coffee a sandwich from dunkin donuts. Also got some coconut water. I had coffee and sandwich and then chugged 4 cans of coconut water to hydrate myself.

Then I got I to a shower and had a cold hot shower.
Really cold shower feels good for the alcoholic during a hangover.  This is because cold water cools down the body and releases some head pressure.  I alternated  between cold and hot . I felt much better.

I had to go out. So I stepped out. I felt something in my chest. I stopped but nothing happened so I left home.
As I traveled for 5 minutes , suddenly my heart started blasting away. Struggling to beat,  I could feel it struggle. I felt very afraid. There was no pain but this was the first time I experienced anything like that.

I somehow managed a u turn ( a long one ) and got back. As soon as I got out of the car , I told a couple I saw to get me water and get me out of the car. And stop the car engine. I called my friend. He arrived and took me to the er. I also felt something releasing in heart after which I felt better. This was when the heart was struggling chugging almost like a car trying to start but cannot.

There they saw the BP.was high. Pulse was high.
They did some tests , put me in bed for 4 hours and then released me.

Foolish me I was thinking maybe I can drink a couple of beers in the evening when I was at the hospital. That has got to be the height of addiction.  A person suffering and yet thinking about doing  the very thing that caused it after being released from the hospital.  That's hoe an alcoholic thinks. Foolish stupid idiotic.

Sanity prevailed and I did not. There was some anxiety the next 2-3 days as the heart didn't feel normal.

Did not drink for 2 weeks.

After 2 weeks I drank a beer and boom the heart just kept pumping hard all night long. I could not sleep.

Did not drink for the next 2 months.

After 2 months I got bolder .I started drinking again 
 Switched to whiskey rather than. Beer. Drank for 6 months. 

Then one day I drank about 350 ml. I had fun that night. 

Woke up around 4 am. Blood pressure high. Tried to walk it off but as I walked I felt even worse.
Came back home and tried to sleep. Tried many things but the palpitations won't stop. A feeling of impending doom and death took over. Went through it for 2 3 hours. Finally called a friend and told me to drop off to er.

Went to er where they again pumped fluids.  After about 5 hours released me. Took an uber home.

Also took a vow to never drink again. 

Since then made er visits due to anxiety in withdrawal.  Doctor prescribed anxiety meds which helped. But I was always on the edge for the next 6 months. (;had to halve the anxiety dose as I had side effects).  After 6 months to 1 year I felt better still  anxiety did not go away.  Took ssri for 3-4 years before quitting it.

Now sober and think of all the foolish things I did.
When an alcoholic the first thing that to camr my mind when I woke up was ok which drink should I go for today. 

5 years later I feel better. I can think normal. I don't feel th3 need to drink. Occasionally I think I should drink wine everyday when I retire.  But once you get sober , you enjoy the freedom.  You are not imprisoned by alcohol.
The headaches hangovers dehydration bad skin puffy eyes upset stomach alcohol breath unrealistic expectations the embarrassing things all stopped. 

Ok too long. Hope it made a difference to your mindset if you are still drinking.
Bye for now

I noticed it when I came back to live at home in March 2020. He would drink rum and coke and leave the bottle in the cupboard until eventually he started keeping it in his room and secretly throwing out the bottle. Some days half the bottle would be gone in one evening, other days a quarter, other days three quarters (I would track it). Then he switched to red wine. He’ll leave the house in the evening to buy more alcohol. Now he fluctuates between beers and rum. The thing is he’s never super super drunk. He just slurs his words a little, is a little more heavy handed and stumbles a little, but not absolutely drunk. Just intoxicated I guess. He does this literally every evening. I can’t remember the last day I didn’t see him drink. My family isn’t close and communication about things deeper than surface level isn’t something we really do, so I’ve never confronted him about this, nor has my mum who pretends everything is fine.

TW: Mentions of sui**de

Hi all, so for the purpose of clarity, we can call my friend M, and our mutual best friend D. I’ve known M since I was 3 years old, and we’ve practically grown up together. However, I have recently moved schools but M and D still go to the same school and I’m still very close with D. Basically, M has been dealing with some things recently - his sister (13) has bad depression and often talks about suicide, which is obviously quite stressful for him I’d say. Recently, he’s been drinking a lot - I’m talking 7 beers, 5 ciders. Every weekend he seems to go get drunk in D’s neighbourhood with D and a few other friends (D only drinks one cider). Anyway, last weekend, M got so drunk that he started agressing random people in the street and at one point even began swearing at a girl. This whole night, D was protecting and helping him. However, towards the end of the night, M entered a fit of rage and started abusing D and being rather violent. D had enough at that stage and told him to get fucked and rode off on his bike until M called him sobbing, apologising and speaking of suicide. Long story short, it’s only been a week and he is currently in a similar state - agressive, and frankly quite scary. I’m not with him right now but D is and has sent me videos. I guess my question is what do we do? I’m quite worried that he will get himself into some serious trouble. 

In fact, at the time of posting this, it turns out that he has almost hit my friend D and now he has left with another friend to go to some random guy’s house. It is pitch black outside and he started drinking at 4pm and has had about 12 drinks which is a fair bit for a 17 yo.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6703237}"

She has had a rough life growing up and is often misunderstood by her peers even now. Truly she is a wonderful person with a huge heart. Sometimes too big of a heart.

The problem really is her drinking. When she drinks she becomes extremely rowdy. It's hard to be around her sometimes like that. She gets loud, overly sexual and overly friendly with strangers.

She drinks so much that she started to leave bottles at my house for when she comes over (which is pretty often). At first I didn't mind even though I almost completely stopped drinking 7 years ago when I turned 22. 

She will triple the dinner tab in her drinks alone. She has shown up at my apartment at 2 am drunk telling me how, not only was she driving under the influence but, she stumbled upon a group of construction men in the middle of the night and spent time with them and lost her brand new phone. Couldn't tell me where the construction site was, couldn't tell me any information at all.

At that point I got really really concerned about her. I'm younger by a few years and I'm not trying to come off patronizing but I worry about her and her health. Recently we started kickboxing together. She started a trial 6 week program with them that requires her to diet. Part of that diet is not drinking. She has to follow this regimen and diet for the 6 weeks to lose a certain amount of weight or she loses her 500$ deposit on the challenge. She said that sucks but OK. She did good for like... 3 days? I had to go on a trip for work for 2 weeks and she stayed at my place for me.

When I came back I found empty cans of tequila drinks. Then she went to a wedding and got wasted. Then she called me from Halloween horror nights drunk... clearly she isn't sticking to her diet even with 500$ on the line and a short time frame. It's a problem. I know she has a problem but I don't know how to bring it up to her.

I've tried AA and I hate it. I've tried several groups but it bores me to death, and is like an hour long PSA. I love sobriety, but I think my depression and anxiety meds dont help. They either make me sleepy, or cause sexual issues, which starts the chain reaction. Then comes the drinking. 

I really should go somewhere to detox but I live alone, and nobody will take my dog in. Also I have bills to pay, especially if I'm about to lose the house. I have family and friends that might take me in, but dont owe me any more help.

I'm just fucking done living like this.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9421149}"
2021-10-22 23:04:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/qdwhzc/6_months_and_7_days_sober/,6 months and 7 days sober.,"I decided in April of this year to make a dramatic change in my life. I had originally posted on here talking about having a terrible night with some old college friends and realizing that they still saw me as the same drunk frat boy from college. This was the moment that I realized that alcohol had controlled my life throughout my 20s (I turned 30 last June). I knew I had to make a change. 

The first few months were difficult. Once my mind realized that I was no longer drinking alcohol - it began being flooding me with memories that I had long oppressed. A lot of these memories were me making an ass of myself. Others were traumatic moments in my life. It was uncomfortable to say the least. I had a constant strain headache and was banging my head against the wall in order for me to stop thinking of them. Just for a moment of relief. 

I reached out to one of my friends, who is a psychologist, and he gave me some simple advice - *breath*. Close my eyes and focus on my breath whenever I began to spiral down with these memories. For me, this helped. It was still uncomfortable, but I was able to process it better each time. I was able to reach 6 months sober and looking forward to finishing out this year. 

Its funny though - when I started going out with my friends again. Always ordering club soda. I began playing a game to see how long it would take someone to ask if I was drinking or not. And almost every-time I talked to someone about my sobriety, they in turn will tell me about the struggle they have with alcohol and how they wish to stop as well. People will begin to treat you differently once they realize that you do not indulge yourself. 

I still have my moments of weakness, but am grateful that alcohol is no longer part of my life.

I've ""quit"" a few times in the past, but never seemed to make it more than a few weeks before relapsing. Each time I did, it was quicker to the bottom, and the withdrawal was worse. This last time, I knew something was different. I realized that in the past I really wasn't quite ready/willing to quit. I was hanging on to ""something"" about drinking. I consciously wanted to quit, knew I had to for several reasons, but there was always some thread holding on to the idea I could return to drinking safely, controlled, whatever. Once I severed that last thread, there was a finality to quitting this last time I didn't have previously. So, here I am, after 148 days (I think?) without any alcohol.

I owe most of my recovery to the book ""This Naked Mind"", by Annie Grace. It really showed me the truth about alcohol, how it affects your mind, body chemistry, and your decisions. And most of all, it changed my opinion of even wanting to drink it. I paired it with substance dependency counseling and group counseling. I'm at a point where I don't feel the need to drink, I have a regular sleep schedule, although I think I still experience some affects from the years of alcohol consumption.

What I'm experiencing now, is guilt, lack of self-worth, and some days I am absolutely consumed by sadness. I'll just wake up and feel sad for the entire day. One day, I drove to the store and just sat in the car in the parking lot and cried thinking about how much pain I brought to the people around me. Is this just my brain chemistry still adjusting? It usually lasts a day or two at most, but it's happened a few times over the last two months or so. My youngest daughter is just starting to get old enough to have a real conversation with. We had about 45 minutes alone in the car together and I asked her if she thought I was different now that I've stopped drinking alcohol. She told me that when I was drinking she sometimes would just start crying at school because she thought I was going to die. \*sigh\* I can't believe I thought this way, but when I was drinking, I actually thought, ""What do they care, this is only affecting myself."" Part of what I've learned since quitting is how much pain I caused those around me, especially my wife and two kids. It's extremely painful hearing my wife and kids describe what they were feeling and experiencing when I was so drunk I couldn't stand up. The worst part is, I don't remember 99% of it.

I'm trying to stay focused on the future, and looking forward. Like a line in the sand - that was me then, this is me know. I am currently without a job and looking. It's hard to convince someone hiring that I'd be a good hire when I feel ""broken"", like I have this history that will forever define who I am in other people's minds. I know there is no way to know what others are actually thinking, but I still feel like I'm somehow less of a person for being a ""drunk"". I didn't anticipate this. I thought I would quit drinking and everything would be magically great and back to the way things were before I hit the wall. My wife still is having trouble understanding why I didn't ""just quit"" when she first brought it up with me. Chemical dependency is difficult for someone else to understand unless they've experienced it. It's not like deciding to stop drinking milk. She thinks I didn't quit because I just didn't love her enough. I've tried to explain that the conscious mind and the body and unconscious mind don't always agree with each other.

So, here I am, it's been a while without alcohol, but I'm feeling sad, lonely, misunderstood, worthless. But, I don't feel like total shit physically, every day. I can actually get out of bed when I plan to, and I make it to commitments I've made with my kids. Still learning, still going.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5943691}"

When sober I am completely non confrontational, highly agreeable and empathetic. Since the age of about 18, when I started drinking more frequently, I’d randomly experience blackouts where I’d act like a literal psychopath. Sometimes when I drink I’m super happy and social. Other nights I’ll start out happy and the next minute get super upset. It’s like there’s a certain point where a switch is flipped in my brain and I get hyper aggressive, run away from my friends, go on a rampage, etc. It’s hard to know when my mood will change because there isn’t a clear pattern and blackouts come over me quickly. Once I’m at that level I have absolutely zero control of my intake or behavior. I don’t have a dependency on alcohol where I have to drink and I never drink on my own. It’s just the random social events where I decide to drink that this happens.

My father has struggled with alcoholism for the entire time I knew him, for the last 5 years he's been in and out of hospitals due to various complications caused either by consuming alcohol directly or by injuries sustained as a direct result of either being drunk or drinking while taking medicine.


I watched my dad die yesterday, he was 65, two years from retirement. At the bitter end there was nothing left, not even harvestable organs due to the damage from alcohol. I've been preparing for this day for years been even still it is hard. We had a very battered relationship due to his consumption and attitude as a result of it. Even still I still lost my father. I lost someone who I had basically no respect for anymore and it still sucks.

Trigger Warning: themes of self harm

I’ve been sober for over 2 years now. I am an alcoholic, and I also am diagnosed with ADHD, Treatment-Resistant Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, OCD, a few learning disabilities, and I’m also codependent (though my life partner left me upon my admitting to alcoholism and a vow to quit immediately.) I am also in therapy and on medications for these things. I haven’t been to an AA meeting in about a month, so that’s the first thing I’ll be doing in the morning, as well as exercising and meditating. I am also unemployed and have been spending nearly every waking hour looking for work for the past month. 
My ex wanted to keep our pets and our home, so wanting her to be happy, I let her. She then told me we could talk soon. I’ve been waiting for over 2 years now and it’s clear that she never wants to see me again. She is usually a very caring person, but after the unexpected death of her father 3 years ago, she changed. She is extremely talented at ignoring the things she probably needs to grieve and process. 
So, again, after all this time in sobriety and recovery, I’ve never been this unhappy. I cry multiple times a day. I’m constantly exhausted from trying and failing at being a person. My self esteem is nonexistent, and even when calm and thinking positively, the future seems hopeless. I don’t want to die, but I find life to be completely unbearable. I don’t know what to do.
Has anyone else felt this way and gotten better? I’m not looking for happiness, success, or something like that. I just want to not feel so worthless, burdensome, undesired and hate being alive all the time. 
Let me be clear: I will NOT ever end my own life. I’ve given it a lot of thought over the years, and it’s just not something I’m willing to do. The last time I was tempted, I told someone who helped me get the help I needed. That is what I will do if or when I feel tempted again. But I’ll say it again because I really don’t want to upset anyone reading this—I am not in danger of taking my own life.
Through all of this, I still haven’t had a single drink. I see so many sober people who are so happy and grateful. I am miserable and ashamed that I am not grateful. Has anyone been like this or known anyone like this? If so, did they ever get better?

So I’ve posted in here before but that was a while back and when my days sober were under the amount that makes a month. As you can tell from the above, I haven’t quite made the big five zero yet, but I’m heading out on the weekend for a late night of long sober partying and even without the hangover I’m going to be in bed all day!
So I figured why not post now, I mean I’ve made it pretty far for a guy who use to struggle to go seven days without a drink. 
And while I do not believe I will never drink again, both due to the fact I am in my twenties and have plenty of stupid life decisions ahead in my future and that I simply refuse to believe some fancy geek won’t figure out a cure-all for addiction, I’m glad I’m still going.
To emphasise I haven’t joined any groups or gone to any meeting, but I’ve never felt I’ve had to. Mostly because when I set my mind to something I am pretty stubborn but also cause I’m very much a dickhead who will only annoy other individuals with jokes made in poor taste or at a bad time. 
But I’ve been making it one day at a time. Not to say it’s easy going, got a killer mingraine from work right now that I now a few drinks could really sort out for a short while. It’s not always mountains we have to face, sometimes it’s just a steady stream of inclines. Not as hard, but they can turn you over and make you fall down if you don’t keep your balance.
I’m glad to say soon I will also be officially telling people about my condition. I think it’s time I let someone in and know I’ve been struggling but I’m still here.
I hope everyone here who is struggling also figures out there own way to stay strong, I know my lone Wolf style isn’t for everyone. So do want you need to do to surivive, endure and most important be happy cause otherwise it’s all a bit shit innit? Later tatters 👋",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43465874}"

He was upfront about this substance issues from the start and was scared i would think he was a scumbag and would not want to be his friend.  I was surprised he admitted it to me so early on. But what I saw was someone clearly struggling who was a sensitive and decent individual who cared for others and wanted to help others. We had fun and interesting conversations, we would stream online movies together and chat at the same time.

However, our friendship had a bit downs as well, he started to become be often drunk when chatting/streaming movies, sometimes he was drunk, sometimes he would say said strange things, assumed we were a couple , flirt with me and jokingly called me a bitch  because i logged in late  (which hurt and shocked me a lot )and last time he was drunk,i got little fed up and it sorta led to an argument with him with me lashing out saying how i dont feel comfortable with his drunk behavior  and not sure if i can continue talking to him, and wished him good luck (i realized that was quite rude and hurtful of me wishing him good luck, it sounded sarcastic looking back at it now and no wonder  he was so hurt by that ) 

He had hard time with what i said and then begged for forgiveness and how he felt awful for making upsetting me and how he felt sick about it how he lost nearly everything, his past relationship, nearly his life before, his job, and how he didn't want to lose friendship with me and it would show what an idiot and loser he was that he destroyed something amazing . how i meant a lot to him and appreciated how such a kind individual like myself is out there willing to listen and inject positivity into his life. how he rather stay in and watch a movie with me than go out with his friends because every friend of his drinks. How he had nothing but respect for me as a kind and caring individual with a heart of gold and how he didn't need to meet me in person to know that is the truth.

I forgave him , his desperation for the friendship not to end was heartbreaking to me and then he appeared drunk again the next time i chatted with him, i accepted that i cannot make him not get drunk and that he will be drunk sometimes when i chat with him. But it was so depressing to witness and speak with him when he was drunk

To see this person so full of potential have his life destroyed due to his illness and slowly self destruct. He lost nearly everything and terrified to lose me which haunts me now. he finally decided to make an appointment to go to rehab but he delayed it for a month and half, staying at friends houses and i knew to get drunk. i was already being distant and i had to give myself a break from this person for the sake of my own mental health .  But i feel awful i just sorta faded out, he always let me know if he may take a while to reply while i just sorta ghosted and let him know very late when he went to rehab of my absence , yet he made sure to notify when he was leaving for rehab and how he valued our friendship

But i knew i had to distant myself . I feel so awful about it now i sort of ghosted him for a while, but then i realized the only person he could help was himself, i could not save him from his destruction. he was not going to stop drinking unless he wanted to, it was too heartbreaking to go through more drunk chats with him so I replied less to him. He caught on and asked with a sad face if i didnt want to talk anymore or if something happened to him or hoped my internet was just down and hoped to speak to me again after he left rehab and left me his rehab address (i asked before because i maybe i wanted to send him a letter)as he promised me he wouldnt leave without telling me goodbye. I replied to him a month later about everything and i didnt hear from until two years later when i logged back into the site, and i didnt notice it until i logged back again another few years later...i feel awful for that

We caught up two and a half years ago and he was so delighted to hear from me and told me his life was going into a positive direction and worked at a job he loved and pleased to hear i was in school. we exchanged emails, and only after one email i never heard from again. A year and half later, I saw from his job posting he died :( i saw a picture of him of one his friends posted in his honor, he looked around 20 in that photo or 19, i havent seen a pic of him before so it made me cry more looking at the picture, he looked so vulnerable, sensitive and i saw a lot of anxiety and pain in his eyes, even i never met him i would be able to tell he was struggling just through the photos. It made me want to give him a big hug. what was haunting he was holding a beer mug and half of it was gone. The very thing he was holding would kill him many years later :(

My goodness, my heart literally felt it broke in half, had a panic attack seeing that posting, tears kept flowing. What a nightmare. I only wanted the best for this fellow who clearly was in constant agony from his addiction and his demons. i feel bad i didnt reach out again to him lately. i didnt want to bother or put pressure on him, maybe he was ashamed that he relapsed.  The only thing i try to make peace with is he is no longer suffering.  i miss him a lot and wanted to talk to him again and that is no longer possible :( RIP",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49456456}"

He made the decision to call 911 and asked them to take him to the hospital for detox. This is his first time getting help so this was a huge step for him! He has communicated that he knows he has a drinking problem and he hates it.  I am trying to stay positive about it, but I know bringing up his alcoholism upsets him.

I ended up in the hospital with my BP at 230/187, my whole body went numb, I couldn't speak, I couldn't move at work. I stayed sober for 2 years, but then went back to it, just not as hard, wine coolers (hate the taste of beer). At about 28 I turned back to hard booze, mainly vodka. I'd buy 1.75 liters and go through it in 3 days, 2 days off, then back to it. I somehow managed to make it like that until I lost my job. Had to quit, which I did, cold turkey, somehow, had klonopin.

After a year, I went back, got bored with life, back to vodka, same as before. Moved on to wine, because it was less hard, and managed that every night for a year. Finally got caught by my family, was forced to quit again, I managed it, not sure how, it was really rough the first 4 days. Once you got caught tho, the cravings seem to go away. Like you don't want to let people down....   


I started back up at 39, to get off the alcohol at 40, I turned to a drug called Tianeptine (gas station shit). I was on it for a year, no drinking, and that was the worse withdrawal I've ever had.... but it worked to stop my drinking. The next year, after experiencing such horrible withdrawal, I was sober.... but since the end of August, I've been constantly back on vodka. It has been 2 months, 1.75 liters every 3-4 days, one day, feel like crap, then back on it. I'm scared I've gone too hard this time and if I try to quit, I'm going to get the DT's (never had them before). I do have depression and anxiety, and after 24 hours of not drinking, my anxiety is through the roof and my mind races with horrible thoughts of my impending death. My sleep is off, I sometimes drink during the day, or sleep during the day, I can not function anymore. I don't want to die (yes, I know, I should have worried about this years ago, I'm stupid)

I can't afford to go to rehab, as I now can barely work after f'n up again. I'm afraid if I stop cold turkey, I will die.... but I know if I keep drinking, I will die. What is my best option? My friends and family have lost all hope in me after so many times failing. My liver function was somehow OK after my blood test in July. I need a way out of this. I need some advice. I'm determined to quit, but after 24 hours, I'm just such a mess, I have to drink something. I know that is just an excuse, but I'm scared to death about having a seizure and suffering the DTs. My normal doctor doesn't handle addiction, says it is ""too risky"", whatever that means. Will just give me clonidine for help with my out of control BP. Says if I have a seizure, just go to the ER. No help with detox. My local hospitals also have no detox unit. The only option I'm giving is to pay $15,000 to spend 15 days in a detox with people sent to jail and have mandatory rehab, the place has horrible reviews. Plus, I don't have $15,000.

Currently I am in 3rd year of med school, and have only 1 year left to get my MD. I see patients in the clinic for various substance use disorders and always advise them to cut down/stop. Then i go home and down 2-3 drinks (Mix of beers, vodka drinks. etc) almost every night. 

I used to never drink. Went through all 3 years of college (did not do a senior year since I was already accepted to med school) and the first year of med school without sipping even a drop of alcohol. I would not have been able to tell you the difference between wine and beer if asked. In the 2nd year of medical school I went through my ""college"" phase : binge drinking hard every other weekend ...then eventually every weekend. 

The current 3rd year of med school has been worse. I have resorted to drinking almost everyday. I had a ""break"" from school of sorts for a month and a half - and I had 3-4 drinks everyday for the entire break. I would only work/study to get it over with so I can start drinking for the day. It got so bad that I was in a constant dissociated state... like living in a shell of myself while sober. I could not concentrate while having conversations with others, I had trouble reading practice questions and answering them, and generally felt very bad. I felt like I was living ""outside"" my body and everything was a dream. Only drinking would get rid of that dissociative state, so I would drink just to feel better. 

I feel a lot more dumb now than before I started drinking regularly. I feel like my mind is literally not working as fast/is not as sharp as before. Yesterday I decided to stop drinking cold turkey. Today I've been fine so far. Hoping to stay like this for the rest of my life. 

Of note, my drinking did not start because of stress, but simply because I was bored and had alcohol at my house. Alcohol gave me a dopamine rush and I enjoyed watching movies while tipsy. I never used alcohol as a coping mechanism, but got addicted to it real quick anyway.

Ive also started blackout binge eating. This is where I get drunk and can’t even remember eating the food even though I know I did from the evidence. I know however the solution to this is not get so drunk in the first place. Although, the problem is that once I have one drink I find it hard to stop.

Last night he did this and because I'd told him earlier in the day that my mental health wasn't great and I needed some help he came home completely off his face, screaming that apparently I'm a risk to the children and he's going to get them taken off me, and then he stormed around the house slamming all the doors and screaming how I'm a disgusting person. Then left to go and get more drunk. 

This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Last time he kicked me and our 9 month old baby out of bed and made us sleep on the sofa.

I've been going through periods of decreased alcohol intake, which was very severe earlier this year (2021), and is now moderate to mild. I'm getting better, but not perfect. With that out of the way...

It seems now that anytime I go a whole day without drinking, and get ready to fall asleep, I get these severe sensations that my heart stops briefly (like palpitations), I feel like I'm falling from a 10 story building or losing consciousness, and I lose my breath and gasp for air. Sometimes it's so bad that I feel my toes tingling afterwards. If I play on my phone for a bit afterwards I'm fine, or get up and walk around, until try to sleep again. It's only when I close my eyes and try to drift off; it happens continually until my brain finally goes to sleep. And I'm so exhausted during the whole ordeal it pisses me off that I can't sleep without it happening. Also, laying on my back it seems better, and worse when I'm on my side. After I'm finally asleep, I sleep completely fine and wake up well rested. 

The WORST part is, it takes at least a week before it starts to only get better. After a couple days of sobriety and being miserable trying to fall asleep, I drink. And when I'm drinking, it never happens. It also never happened when I drinking heavily and had a few days of sobriety before.

I thought that it could be sleep apnea... But I don't wake up during the night gasping for air. Only when I'm still awake and trying to nod off. I thought that maybe it could be hypnic jerks, but I thought those were more of a body twitch and jerk sensation (which I had as a kid, and this doesn't feel like that). I just hope it's not some form of nervous system damage.

It is so debilitating... And want to know if anyone else has had this and could help give some pointers. Being that I'm at a more mild drinking level now, I have no other severe withdrawal symptoms, besides a morning hangover. Not one that lasts all day and the next day.

If anyone has pointers or stories of a similar sensation, please let me know. Thanks to you all!!!",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6012316}"

Could I die? Because I get panic from thinking I'm going to die!!! It's like I didn't even go a day without a drink and death usually hits on day 3 or 4 

Does anyone have some knowledge on this because my exes girlfriend was drinking heavily 10 years and had epilepsy which is worse she died in her sleep from heart failure. 

So my liver is pretty beat up doctor said stop headed for cirrhosis because GGT was 550 u/l and ALT was 400 or something but she said just stop 

So how much and how long do most females make it drinking or men you go hard because between stopping and facing the problem vs keep going liver failure or heart failure I'm in a crossroad Wondering which path to take?

I wish I was constantly reminded once a week about the physical harm that cam be caused and the lingering effects.
For eg the  chance of getting cancer goes down after quitting but is equal only after a great many years with non alcoholics. This rate is different for different cancers. The risk is heightened even if you quit for some more years. So the earlier you quit the better fornyou

I can tell.you that the stomach liver pancreas kidney are all struggling when you are an alcoholic and they keep struggling for many years. Don't forget heart.
Brain comes back after about 6-12 months.  You can actually understand how many mistakes you made as a drunk when you look back. It's so embarrassing to even think about it.

What usually will happen is some life threatening event  will force you to stop. Now you cannot function properly.  You wish you had quit before. All the sense comes back to you 

 But if only some kept reminding you.

Noone tries to advise you usually as you are beyond listening. Even to yourself.

 But being reminded of medical issues can maybe
 inspire some to quit or reduce or at least reconsider

Many people responded to my previous post indicating that telling this to an alcoholic is useless. I disagree.  Infact alcoholic who log in here should be reminded frequently.

TL;DR at bottom

I still struggle with my alcoholism but have thankfully come back from this point in my life. 

I used to drink almost an entire fifth of cheap, rot-gut whiskey every night. The most I'd go without doing this was a day at a time, for about a year, but it was almost every day. At the time I was 20, probably like 140 lbs and female (still that last one though). Not sure if it matters. 

Anyway, I woke up one day to the absolute worst hangover of my life. I don't really ever get hangover headaches but I do get crippling nausea. But it would only typically be 1-2 vomits in a day, and just super nauseous until the next day. 

Well this day was different. I could hardly handle water. I couldn't even handle liquor that was leftover from the night before. All I ever had in the house was water, whiskey, soda/chasers, or beer. 

After vomiting probably five or six times and rolling around in bed, visiting every single ""hangover cure"" page off Google, I resolved to go to the gas station and get some Powerade. 

I picked green, blue, and pink flavors. While driving back home I was taking sips of the green one. 

I reached the turn in to the homestead, which at the time was a run-down, packed, trashy trailer park. I was making that left turn and all of the sudden I could feel all of the beverage coming back. Considering I was in the middle of my turn, I could not stop the car and had to complete it. Well, the vomit came too soon and I spewed all over my steering wheel. This turned into one of the most embarrassing moments of my life; I guess the liquid triggered the horn in the car because it started going off consistently.

I saw some neighbors standing outside staring as I drove past with my horn going BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! I had no idea what to do. Probably woke up everyone who was still sleeping.

That's really it. For the rest of the day I just rolled around and tried to keep down my liquids. I think later in the evening after more sleep I felt a bit better. But yeah. I laugh on it now but I know for a fact that was the worst hangover I've ever had. Never vomited that much in a single day in my whole life. 

I just saw a post of someone else's steering wheel getting triggered and doing the same exact thing which reminded me of this.

It always bothered me before, but recently it's been taking a toll.

They've been extremely confrontational, and it feels like when they pass a certain point while drinking they want to start a fight with everyone around them. This has happened a handful of times this month already, and they've been damaging their relationships with family and friends because of it.

The worst of it happened a few nights ago, and only today did they begin to consider going to an AA meeting. I'm very supportive of this. I want them to get better for everyone's sake, but they seem to be busying themselves with other things to keep from going.

I don't want to force them, because I know how anxiety-inducing these kinds of things can be. I've had several family members who have received help for their alcohol addiction as well, so I don't want to be inconsiderate and rush them. However, their work has been extremely stressful lately and I feel that if they don't go now, on the weekend, they will go back to drinking during the week.

He also doesn't appear to want to get help for his alcoholism. My partner wants to get help for him. 

We just caught her brother in a nasty binge. He's in his 30's living with his single mom that works a lot of doubles as a nurse. He gets a lot of time alone in their apartment since he was recently fired (many sick calls, the employer assumes is the result of being hung over). Their sister just moved in until she can find a new place for herself, and she's seeing how bad things are and talking to her sister- my partner. 

This week this brother, was locked away in his room. Everyone knew why of course. It was to drink. But after 3 days of not being seen, everyone was getting worried. Well tonight he emerged from seclusion to go buy more alcohol. The sister took a peek in his room and was disgusted with the stink of vomit in his trash. He had been drinking for three days until sick and drinking again.

She called the EMTs on her brother, and calls my partner. The mother is at work doing a double and unaware. 

We don't know what to do. If their mom kicks him out, he's just going to be homeless (he also has a bad heart condition) because he has nowhere to go. This has been going on with varying severity for years and everyones about had it. I see him as a user of people. He'll go out to lunch with his sisters and convienantly forget his wallet. Call up everyone with a key to their place when he locks himself out and demands they drive an hour out to let him back in. Get lost in some unknown town no one has been to before and never thank his family that came looking for him to get him back to safety. 

The mom doesn't have an easy choice. Tough love puts him on the street. Soft love means he doesn't do anything- he knows how much his drinking hurts his family. He just doesn't care. I think she shelters him because the alternative will kill him. 

So we're all at a loss. What do we do? I understand to beat alcoholism he's got to want it, but how do we get him the help he needs right *now?*",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.77688235}"

I am not going to tell you not to drink. But I am going to suggest this: please **don't drink and drive**. If you do drink again, don't pick up those car keys. Besides the legal aspect, you could kill yourself or someone else. You could hit a car and kill an entire family. You could die. You could end up spending years (or life) in prison. It's just not worth it. Never drive drunk.

I am very passionate about this. I have almost died due to drunk driving accidents. If you do one thing when you go back out, do this: walk or take a cab. You can save a life. Its deadly and dangerous to be on the road drunk. Both for you and for others. Don't risk it.

My friend and I had a falling out four years ago, over a political topic where we both got very heated about the topic, but not at each other. He was good for a while and then decided he wanted space. I respected that. Years went by and I wondered why he didn’t call me back. Well, we rekindled. He has been extremely malnourished from drinking, and went to rehab and his liver was failing at age 32. 

Well, he’s doing better after a relapse, he returned to living with his fiancé. So I just had a phone conversation with him. My sister was got engaged a few weeks ago and we had a family event with both families meeting. He got overly protective of her for some reason and was very adamant about coming over to screen the guy, in a phone conversation with my brother, so bizarre. This was a couple weeks ago. 

Anyway, I talked to him about it, and wanted to talk about his behavior. We somehow got into a convo about the argument four years ago. Apparently he said that he remembered that I slapped him and he had to wrestle me off of his brother. Mind you, this had never happened. It was absolutely disconcerting. He believed every word he spoke and with confidence. 

I told him that I may have to reconsider our friendship if he truly believes that, or at the very least need some space to register what just happened. I almost don’t think it’s worth it to be friends any longer. He lashed out at me for this. Said I need to apologize for it. It was truly surreal. I did some research and apparently this is something that could happen with long term alcohol abuse and low Vitamin b-1 intake, because alcohol inhibits absorption of these vitamin which is involved in short term and long term memory. He was 180 and is now 125lb. I feel like I should overlook this because of his health but it kind of strikes at the foundation of our friendship. The real memory of that day might not be recovered so he permanently may remember it this way.

This is going to be long and probably just a bunch of word vomit because I don’t talk about it much. 

My (22f) parents (51f & 48m) have been alcoholics for as long as I can remember. They used to bring me and my older brothers to their friends’ houses, party it up, get drunk, and drive us home in the wee hours of the morning. Their friends would come over to our house and I remember hanging out all night with them at like 6 years old thinking it was so cool to be able to stay up late with adults unlike my friends, who had bedtimes. 

My dad and I always had a very close relationship, as I was his only child (my brothers have a different dad than me). I used to look back fondly on my childhood, remembering my dad and I sitting out in his man cave listening and singing to music until late on school nights. We would do everything together, go fishing, hunting, driving around, whatever he was doing I was right by his side. 

And now that I have a child, I realize the man I loved so much growing up, the man that was my hero, my everything, who I looked up to, is a very bad alcoholic who is slowly killing himself in front of me. Now I look back at my childhood and see a whole different side of things since I’m old enough to understand. I look back and see my little self, probably 8 years old, begging my dad to go inside the house and go to bed because he was so drunk he was passing out and I was worried he would fall out of his chair and hit his head. I remember it being dead winter and he had fallen asleep, so I brought in wood and stocked the fire in the stove so at least he would be warm, I’d grab a blanket and fall asleep on the chair, never leaving his side, because I was making sure he was okay. 

I had very bad stomach aches around this time too, up until high school I would get them. They would be agonizing, my parents blamed it on gas, now I realize I only got them when I would worry about them, which was all of the time. I’m guessing it had something to do with anxiety, I’m still not 100% sure but that’s what I can come up with. 

My mother is also in the same boat, always drinking. We’ve had our differences throughout the years, I think most of it stems from me not having someone I can talk to like most people have with their mother. I remember being in like 2nd grade and getting off the bus and coming inside to a very drunk mom. I asked her if we could go outside and go for a walk or play and she said “not right now I’m busy”. As she cracked open yet another beer and sat down to watch whatever was on tv that night. I asked her if maybe after that beer we could go, she said maybe, 15 minutes later I hear her get up. I hurry and put my shoes on thinking we’re going to go outside and I hear another can crack open. My heart sank, so I went in there and asked her if she could please stop drinking so much. She says “I’m a god damn adult and I will not have a kid tell me what I can and can’t do.” I don’t think I ever asked her to play with me after that. 

Cut to my 8th grade year, wintertime, it’s volleyball season. We went to an away game, my dad wasn’t going to be at the game, I believe he had to work. My mom assured me she would be there. It’s the 3rd round of varsity, I’m up to serve, it’s 11-14, we’re losing, if I miss this serve we lose. I’m looking around for my mom, or anyone for that matter to be there to support me, nobody. I serve the ball, we get the point. It’s so quiet in the gym, I hear the doors open and I see my mom stumble into the gym, my heart sinks. I serve the ball and it goes over, all I can hear is my mom being utterly obnoxious, the score is 13-14 and all I want to do is miss this serve so the game will be over and my mom won’t embarrass me any more. I end up getting the next 3 serves over and we win the game. 

I go to the locker room and change as fast as I can when I hear one of my teammates say “yeah, I think she’s drunk”. I run out the door and tell my mom “let’s go”. My principal and my coach stop me as I’m walking out and they practically beg me to ride the bus instead of ride with my mom. But, I knew it was snowing and I was sure if I rode the bus my mom was going to wreck and die, so I went with my mom. About a mile down the road she’s swerving all over the place, so I tell her to stop and let me drive. I don’t know where we are or how to get home, no phones with gps, just hope that my mom’s directions will actually get us home. Of course we have to take country roads to get home, and of course, we get lost, slide into a ditch, and I, a 13 year old girl, has to go knock on a strangers door and ask for help. Finally we walk through my front door at 3am to my dad absolutely livid at my mom and 4 missed calls from my principal asking if I had made it home. I didn’t talk to my mom for a month after this. 

There are countless other instances that both of my parents were drunk for, there wasn’t a day of my childhood that I can remember my parents not drinking. At the time I thought it was normal, and now I resent them for it. We never did anything fun, never went to the zoo or the aquarium, no water parks, hell we were lucky if they took us to Walmart to go grocery shopping. All they wanted to do was drink at home, or at friends’ houses, or go booze cruising with their friends and me in the car. 

I’m not sure if recently it’s worse or if I’m just more aware, but I am so scared for their health. The day before my baby shower, we were decorating and my mom got so drunk she told my MIL she didn’t even want to be in the room when my daughter was born and that she could take her spot (I had already made up my mind that nobody would be in the room besides me and my SO). She also doesn’t remember anything that happened that night, she practically reacted like it was a surprise birthday party when she walked in the next day and saw the decorations that she had already seen the night before. I wonder how many other moments of my life she doesn’t remember. 

My dad eats with us every Sunday, and he doesn’t drink while he is here. But, I see him shaking so badly and I know it’s withdrawals from not drinking for 12 hours or so. His memory is so bad, he will tell us the same story multiple times within a week. I worry my daughter won’t grow up with her grandparents, my mom’s sister died from liver failure a few years back as a result of her alcoholism. I have tried everything I can possibly think of that isn’t fully sending them to a rehabilitation facility because I know they would never speak to me again. I’ve tried calmly talking, yelling, crying, threatening to move out at 16 and never speak to them again, telling them what their consequences will be for their health, explaining that one night while driving home drunk you may hit someone head on and kill them and it could very well be me in that other car. I just don’t know what else to do. 

Now that I’m out of the house it doesn’t effect me as much, but I think it’s gotten worse sense I moved out because they don’t have someone nagging about it all the time. What’s so infuriating is 1) they don’t remember anything that I tell them they’ve done when I talk to them about how their alcohol problems have messed me up. And 2) they’re upstanding grandparents to my daughter. I’ve set boundaries and told them if they ever watch her and I come over to even one single beer opened, they will never see her again. The way I see them with my daughter is something I never got to experience as a child, and it makes me feel worthless. 

I’m not sure what I wanted out of this. Mostly just to get it out finally after 22 years. Maybe to let others know if you’re in a similar situation that you’re not alone. Maybe for those of you who are trying to find the right reason to stop drinking, if you have kids, this is your reason. Also, to see if anyone has any advice to get through to them.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45351735}"

She was missing work and getting warnings from her job, locking herself in her room all day, rarely cleaning up after herself, and falling all over the place very often and hurting herself.  We talked to her about it 3 days ago and offered help and support. We want to be there for her in any way we can and are trying to understand what she’s going through. 

Twice in the past few days she has projectile vomited all over our shared hallway. The other day she was very surely drunk, but today, she says she was not drunk. She told me she has not had alcohol in the past 2-3 days. However, when I spoke with her she seemed like she usually does when she’s at least tipsy. She was slurring her words, talking in circles, and would stumble a bit when she walked (not as much as when she’s heavily intoxicated but enough for it to seem like she’s been drinking).

If she was drinking, I’m not trying to judge her because I know that it’s a struggle. I don’t expect her to be able to stop cold turkey especially after drinking so heavily for the last few months, but I did feel like she was being dishonest with me. If her getting sick was triggered by alcohol then we need to renegotiate our living arrangements because unfortunately I don’t feel completely comfortable with somebody who is throwing up in our rented apartment so frequently. I really can’t stand to be around vomit and while she does “clean” it, my boyfriend and I always have to end up cleaning it again because she never gets it all. She had been doing it for months but before had always said it was due to stomach issues.

I told her she could be honest with me if she was drinking, but she said she’s not and that she’s just been feeling kind of drunk all day. I’m wondering really if feeling/ acting drunk is a symptom of withdrawals, or if she’s not being truthful. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, as I don’t understand how she must be feeling right now. I just love her and care about her so much and want to help her as much as I can.

So my question to those in this group is what would you have wanted your spouse to say or do, that would've helped you, and without pissing you off? 

We have been separated for over a year, but still communicating, going to marriage counseling, and seeing each other a couple times a month, sometimes more (seeing each other has only been over the past 6 months). His drinking was one of the reasons we separated, although he wouldn't admit that he had a problem at the time. We were at each other's throats all the time and I was actually the one who suggested he should go visit his parents (who live in another state) while we take a break for a few weeks and take time to calm down, refocus, and come up with a plan to work on our marriage. Despite me being very clear with my ask, he interpreted it as he should move out, so he packed some stuff and went to stay with a friend. The friend ended up getting re-married, moved out of the house they were sharing and now my husband is living there alone, barely surviving on unemployment as he has been out of work for 2 years.

We were making progress with the marriage counseling but then started to slide backwards, which I believe is probably due to his drinking getting worse. Telling him that he may think he's hiding things from me, but that I know him too well (we have been together for 20 years and married for 10) and I can tell when he's lying, and I can see the shame that he's feeling, and that he doesn't need to feel that shame with me. That I love him unconditionally and I believe alcoholism is a disease, and that we can work through this together, but he needs to make the first move.  

Our marriage counselor agreed that we couldn't make much progress on our relationship until he gets help for his addiction, and he recommended a treatment center. It took a couple of weeks and a little prodding from me, but my husband did finally call and did an over the phone assessment. The treatment center recommended an intensive outpatient program that would be done virtually 4 days a week for 3 or 4 hours each night. I told him I would pay for the treatment since he isn't working. But after the assessment we've hit a standstill. He hasn't taken the steps to start treatment and I haven't brought it up because he has told me that he feels ""pressured"" by me and that there is no timeline for any of this. And yes, I'll admit I have brought up the fact that I want us to keep moving forward. I don't have dates in my head, but that I was looking to see progress, even if it was slow. 

The past couple of weeks we have went through spurts of him calling or texting several times a day, to him not reaching out for days. When he doesn't reach out, I try to give him that space that he seems to want. I really want to bring up the subject of initiating treatment but also don't want to cause more tension. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on, but I also don't want to let him go completely because once I start down that path emotionally, I'm not sure I can come back. It's also challenging because his family is basically my family at this point. I have great relationships with his family, from his parents, to his brother, even to aunts/uncles/cousins. Over the years we've been together I've lost both my parents to cancer so his parents literally are my parents now and we talk at least a few times a week. I've mentioned to them that he's depressed, he's been drinking a lot, but have not shared how bad it really is. They are actually coming into town next week to visit us, so I know we will have some time together as a family. 

So my questions to this community are 1) how can I bring up the subject of starting treatment without pissing him off?  And 2) thinking back to when you were in active addiction, what could your spouse or significant other said or done that would have been helpful?",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46561834}"

I (29M) have a friend (31M) who I believe is an alcoholic. Our entire friend group has acknowledged it to each other, but we’re not sure if he knows or understands. When we were in college, we would of course go on drinking binges, so we didn’t think about it then. 
We’ve been out of college for nearly a decade and he seems to have the same habits. He lives alone and drinks quite a bit, 3-4 nights a week. It’s enough to where our friend group notices based on the texts he sends us, which are typically not happy texts. He’s never indicated thoughts of self harm or suicide, but he does talk a lot about being a bad friend during these times. He’ll also ask our friends why their girlfriends hate him, etc. And to be clear, he has never been a bad friend and no one’s significant other hates him at all. He’s an awesome guy, so I’m not sure what makes him have these thoughts (other than the alcohol). 
We always have fun drinking with him, but the fact that he’s having way too much on weeknights while alone and the constant negative thoughts is just very concerning. 
Our friend group loves him very much and just doesn’t want to see things get worse. 
FWIW, I would be more than glad to also stop drinking if I knew it would help him.

Was able to quit liquor more or less cold turkey but until very recently still was regularly downing IPA like I was the voodoo ranger himself.  

Something about the it, maybe the strong hops just chilled me out immensely like nothing else.  Even at the expense of making my antidepressants stop working for a few days, I would still slam back 5-6 of these things in a night and anyone who knows strong IPA knows that the 9% alc means that those 6 beers were actually more like 10-11 in regular drink terms.  

Lately I’ve found 2 things that actually help a lot to quell the cravings and still chill me out more or less the same.  It’s like having the same relaxation without being drunk.  

The first is hopps tea.  You can find this on Amazon for relatively cheap.  While it may taste like absolute ass, I’m not gonna lie, with enough creamer or sugar it is passable.  May not be the same for everyone but for me I have found that a couple of cups of  it chills me out the same way that IPA did.

The second one is a specific non alcoholic IPA.  Most of the NA beer I have tried in the past tastes horrible and really did nothing for me but this one for some reason just hits different.  “Just the haze” from Sam Adams had been a godsend for me lately.  It tastes more or less just like a real IPA and from what I can tell must have a high hops content because it also chills me out just like the tea.  There is only one store near me that sells the stuff so it may be hard to find.  Best believe every week I stock up on the stuff when ver I get the chance.

I have wrestled very deeply with this for well over three years now, and if you make it to the end of this and have any insight or wisdom, I cannot thank you enough from the bottom of my heart. 

I (33 F) have known my boyfriend (33M) for over ten years. We were very close friends back in the day, and after losing touch and living our own lives, we got back in touch and have been dating for almost three years now. I have two daughters from a marriage, and they absolutely love him and call him Dad on their own volition, and for the most part, my boyfriend has more than rocked this being-a-step-dad-but-being-dad thing. We have lived together for over a year now. 

When we were younger, and throughout his 20’s, he was a big drinker, as were all of his friends. He used to drink a six pack on weekdays/weeknights, and even more throughout the day on weekends. He also plays  ball hockey every Sunday with these friends of his, and they have accrued even more like-minded friends who love the sport and alcohol. It’s been a tradition for him to drink beer all day Sunday, and though games can start early around 10AM and as late as 4PM, they always, and I mean *always*, have beers before, during, and after the game(s). It’s not rare for someone to be throwing up from running and hard exertion while drinking beer/water during “resting” times. 

When we first began dating, he was drinking at least two tall cans or a six pack a night. I noticed, but honestly never thought this would go anywhere serious, because he’s always been that guy— funny, fun, loud and scarily outgoing, can come off as arrogant and curt, center of attention… and he’s also usually the butt of his friends’ jokes when they’re all around each other.  He knows this, and has complained, but always brushes it off. I should also mention it is very important to him to be seen as manly, or “a man,” so he has some stubborn ideas and beliefs about a variety of topics, and we have bickered about these at length for years now. There’s a lot of anger in our relationship, and a lot of it has come from his expression of anger; he has gotten incredibly emotionally and verbally abusive, and has at times gotten physically abusive (wouldn’t let me leave, or get in my car, would walk towards me and force me to step backwards, held onto my wrists too hard and left a small bruise, has wrestled me for things like my phone or a stuffed animal…). 

These anger issues existed already from way back when, and there is a LOT of unprocessed trauma from his childhood. His father was addicted to meth, and his mother was emotionally unavailable and borderline neglectful to her sons, but spoiled her daughters. He witnessed many toxic fights and dynamics, as well as terrible behaviors including infidelity. Their family was well-off, but lost it all due to his father’s drug addiction, and obviously that left a mark on him throughout the rest of his teens/into adulthood. 

Fast forward. We date. He drinks. I find myself drinking beer with him just to ensure he can’t drink the entire six pack to himself, because I can’t stand the way he behaves once he’s had a certain amount. Leery eyes, leaning body posture, slurred speech, eyelids half-closed, super unattractive to me. But me being codependent, I held my tongue until I realized it wasn’t going to stop; he didn’t handle it well, blame-shifted, gaslit, and I let it go. To shorten this as much as possible, while we have fought a fuck ton, we have had around six major fights where my children were directly in the line of fire for his emotional/verbal abuse, and one super bad one where I had to call his parents to help me out by talking him down over the phone, which did not work— he was cussing at me, telling me the most evil things about myself, and he used my traumas against me frequently in conflict. 

Through all of this, he would first deflect, shift blame, make it my fault because I made him snap by whatever it was that I kept doing that “hurt” him. That would last anywhere from a day to a week. Then he would finally apologize, has apologized to my children far too many times now, and would promise he wouldn’t do that to us again. Needless to say, it happened again, just a couple weeks ago… and I know for a fact that it only happened because he was drunk. 

When I have confronted him with my feelings about beer, he has ALWAYS said the following:
1. I don’t drink hardly as much as I used to. I have cut back so much compared to how much I used to drink, you have no idea.
2. It’s not beer, I know how much I can drink. I just can’t control your anger. You’re always so angry especially when I have a beer. 
3. I don’t have an addiction. My mom always said I’d be an addict and I hate when you say that. I just love beer, I don’t depend on it and I just enjoy it. I love the taste. 
4. I don’t see anything wrong with having some beer with my [insert brother/sister/friend/whoever] on a [usually weekend night]. 
5. (When he has driven after having more than the LEGAL limit and I call him out for it) I know my limit, I know when I have had too much to be driving.  

I should mention that he’s cut back since this became a huge problem the first time. He now drinks anywhere from a tall can a night to two tall cans, and that can happen anywhere from 1-5 times a week. Weekends, he’ll drink anywhere from 2 tall cans to 4 tall cans… and that’s only if there’s no hockey. With hockey, I have no idea how much it is. And let’s not forget his job allows him to be very relaxed in time and he’s having to drive from job to job… he makes his day’s schedule out. And I’ve seen empties in his truck bed randomly, but if I call it out, he always has an excuse. It was from the weekend, or his brother, or whoever. But I know what beer he drinks and what his brother drinks. 

In any case… it happened again. Recently. After he really promised the time before this. And swore he’d do therapy. Except I started therapy as agreed upon and he never did. 

I don’t know why I have stayed this long. But he’s now agreeing to putting a limit on his drinking, for example he’d stick to only letting himself have three beers on a weekend. I originally asked him for sobriety but he has skirted that topic completely. When I tentatively brought up the limit option, he jumped for it, and I didn’t see that until after the convo was done and thought about it. He denies that alcohol is the issue and says he’ll set limits for himself until we’re done with couples counseling to prove to me that he can be trusted with beer again… 

What am I creating in my mind here? Is this me being dramatic? He said I’m the only girlfriend who’s complained or said anything about his beer consumption, and I know a few of his ex girlfriends… they were just as all about hedonism like he was. I’m quite the opposite of all of his exes, and have been told that by his family, which I used to think was a good thing until that comment he made. I feel it’s very clear that beer was a factor in all of our huge fights and there have been so many fucking times where he’s abused me and the girls secondhandedly, by letting them listen to him talk shit on their mother and how he’s done with her, etc. But he always says sorry and gets kind and patient and appears to be “doing the work” but it feels like it’s me cooperating with his love for beer again. I have told him hundreds of times how the fact that he can’t not have a beer if it’s offered is a red flag among so many others, and it’s a major red flag that he doesn’t care that it bothers me— he’d rather hear me complain than stop drinking, and when he’s cut back or had to decline, it’s caused a fight because he’ll call me controlling. 

He’s promised my girls to never do that to us again (this last time he called my older kiddo a liar, yelled at her like he’s never done before, made them both cry again…) and when my older kiddo called him out for having said that before, he began preaching about what forgiveness means! And he also said he’d take different steps this time. Whatever that means. 

Am I being controlling for requesting that he remain sober from alcohol until we are through with couples counseling? Given the fact that we haven’t even started, who knows when that will be. If I am justified in asking him to be sober, how the hell do I ask that?

I'm an 19 year old college student and my friend recently has been bringing up some concerns about how often i'm not sober (even calling me an alcoholic). It feels a little odd to think about this since all my life i've been around people who drink and smoke. Being in college, I see people drinking all the time during the day, on the weekends, at dinner, etc.  I never thought I was doing anything that abnormally until I was asked to really think about it. 

I've smoked weed since i was 13 almost everyday, but again so does most of the people around me. I never used to drink that much until senior year of highschool and I've worked up to drinking almost everyday now. I usually don't drink until the sun has gone down at least but I will drink every night if I can. In most families I see, their parents drink every day. My parents sure did and they never seemed out of control. My grades are fine, I have fine relationships with those around me, I feel perfectly rational so i'm not sure if I should even be concerned.

I don't get trashed or anything unless its been a hard day or I'm out partying or something, but I do find I'm relying on it more and more to sleep or even just not feel like shit about my life (i struggle with an anxiety disorder and what I'm considering to be some depression although it is undiagnosed). I don't feel conventional cravings or withdrawal for alcohol, just craving for the distraction it provides me from life.

I'm just fucking tired of living and have felt this way for years now but as life goes on  all I wanna do is completely waste and rot away in a room with unlimited booze and music. 

Alcohol has the strongest grip on me and has since the day I turned 19 (turning 21 in March) when I drink, I love blacking out and doing it over again and again day after fucking day.

My mom has been bitching and complaining about me spending ALL of my money on liquor the day I get it and calling me her favorite word ""drunk""  it's been a huge changer in our relationship since I started. I'm not an asshole drinking even when plastered. I'm a fairly nicer person. 

When we get into fights Ive told her many times ""oh yeah because I only drink for fun, because fun like that is why I'm okay with destroying my body just for fan, totally don't have a job anymore just for fun, never leave the house, just for fun, sleep until 4 in the afternoon, just for fun, scars all over my body, just for fun. No other reason at all"" 

No matter what I fucking say she refuses to believe I'm depressed and struggling. Even if I committed suicide shed just say ""oh he's just did that for attention, he wasn't depressed""

She's constantly degrades me by telling me I look like shit  and that I'm ugly and look like a drug addiction and homeless, literally every single fucking day.

But yet she says she tells me I look like shit is because she cares about me and if she didn't care she would say anything at all, but yet never lets me open up to her or anything about depression.

I barely have any friends because I cut most of them off trying to better myself because I found out how extremely ugly and sinister they are.

I just completely give up on life at this point, I love sleeping just so I can live in my dreams which I really do love. 

The only thing that can change me is my dream to have a community of fans even if it's small I want to start doing live streaming such as being a Vtuber which I'd love to with my whole heart.
That idea was from a few of my actual good friends and even the shitty ones say used to say "" you should become a streamer because your entertaining as fuck"" plus I'm extremely good with social networking and all that exposure thing. Also my bestfriend significantly grew because I helped him get exposure, it's something I'm good at.

I just feel like I wasn't supposed to keep living after my first near death situation so life is introduced me to drinking and my situation just to try to make he as miserable enough to make me end it myself.

Well, here goes nothing. I'm a 22 year old male and I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm lucky to be alive quite honestly. This is my story. It's quite long so skip to the fun parts if you so desire, or don't read it at all, but there's some good lessons to be learned....

My first drink was at 17. I didn't have many friends in HS despite getting along with everyone and playing multiple sports. When I was invited to parties or to hang out, I much rather preferred to be at home alone relaxing. I grew up in a well off family in NJ. Dad worked for JP Morgan Chase on Wall Street in NYC. I loved my dad, he was my best friend. We were very close, until he lost his job in 2013. After that, I noticed the drinking. He would drink at my baseball games, in the bathroom of my HS during the school play. He didn't think I noticed, but I did. My mom and him were always fighting, he played mental games with us. Tried to keep us awake at night by screaming at the TV and turning the volume up. I sleep with a sound machine and ear plugs because of it now. I was only 14 when my parents split. He left on my birthday. Kept trying to contact my twin brother and I and try to find out where we lived so he could pay us a visit. Used to show up to my baseball games in HS before some of my biggest starts. My point is, I never wanted to be him. But I became him anyway.

In college the drinking was normal college antics. A few blackouts, just drinking on the weekends. In January 2020 I was doing very well. I had a perfect life. A perfect job teaching people how to fly airplanes in college, the perfect friends, and a cute girlfriend. I got a knock on my door one night in January. It was my college neighbor. He was my uber driver the night before. He asked if we could hang out. He was a college dropout and a year older than me. He was 21 and I was 20. I said sure, thinking I'd be a nice guy. He seemed weird but he could buy me booze so why not? We started hanging out and of course drinking. He would always bring alcohol over, he also chewed tobacco. Well things slowly started to escalate as he told me about his life and situation. He was suicidal and suffered from depression. It eventually got to the point where he needed me to hang out with him otherwise he was going to kill himself. And every time, we just drank more and more together. Sometimes he would bring me my favorite handle of vodka for free. All this while I was balancing work and college. I wanted to be a nice person and be there for him, but being his therapist was absolutely draining. It was a full time job.

One night in February he tried to kill himself. I remember seeing him slumped over next to his wall as I entered his pitch black apartment. The TV lit up the apartment and the knife was still next to him. There was blood everywhere. My GF and I took him to the hospital and from that night on I was never the same. My drinking increased, I stopped going to work. Showed up to class drunk, drove drunk, and made horrible choices. Pulled a knife on my GF one night, punched my neighbor in the face when he wouldn't let me leave his apartment, called my gay best friend a faggot repeatedly to him face, tried to assault my own fucking mother and busted my face open on the sidewalk one night drinking with friends. I'm not ashamed to admit what I did while drunk because we all do very bad things when we're addicted. I'm sure some have done worse. I cut my neighbor out of my life, just ignored him after trying to get him the help he needed (help was VERY hard to get for him here in the US, it was absolutely terrifying).

I drove home when COVID hit in March. I was withdrawing the whole 11 hour drive. It was awful. My mom didn't even recognize me when I got back. So I told her everything. I hallucinated, heard voices, couldn't sleep. It was literal hell on earth and I couldn't escape it. I didn't drink for the next month, but I turned 21 in April. I wanted to drink for my 21st bday even if none of my friends were there. The summer of 2020 I drank, but not every day. I drank by myself maybe 3-4 times a week. When I got to school, things fell apart. My first week on campus I didn't drink once. Then I got COVID in early September. At that point I drank every day. I was having sex with a different girl every day before I got COVID, going to parties and blacking out. Having a blast. Or so I thought. I was withdrawing again, heart rate 100+, seeing things, hearing things. My last day drinking was 10/6/20 into the morning of 10/7. I went to the liquor store and my vodka I always get was out of stock. It was a sign from above. A sign I didn't listen to. I bought another fifth of vodka (I could polish it off in a day towards the end of my career) and went home to drink. I woke up and went about my day as normal, came home to take a nap and was hit with the worst stomach pain I've felt in my life. Had my friend drive me to the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I spent 4 days in the hospital alone due to COVID. I realized I had finally crossed the line.

And now here we are, a year later. I'm not an emotional person but I did cry when the sun rose on October 7. I quit because I was literally going to die if I didn't. My friends have been so supportive. I grew apart from the college friends who drank and partied all the time. Some of them still live that lifestyle. I wake up fresh every morning, good group of friends and a stable job. I still have some issues to clear up with in relation to my job and being a heavy alcohol user in the past. But I'm only 22 and I'll get my dream job one day. My mood is improved and so is my happiness. I remember laying over my bed and dry heaving while crying for no reason while drinking. Absolutely insane, I'm a normally happy person. My job requires me to go to AA for 90 days before I get my licenses back. I've never gone to work drunk, I would just call out. But it's a very strict profession, so I'm focusing on myself and I'll go back to full time on my terms.

Long story short, I had a rough time in early schooling, and alcohol has been my miracle drug in terms of socializing and relationships. On top of that, I’m a professional musician, and three or four shots are what I take to loosen up and play with passion and creative looseness. These aren’t things that I can just get used to over time sober; These issues are very much part of me, and I want to find an alternative that isn’t going to kill me. I’m at an impasse where I want to live, but I drink to live, if that makes sense.

What I’m wondering is if anyone has had any success with medication that has treated these underlying issues. I need help. I was in the hospital with bad withdrawal a couple months back, and the nurse gave me an Ativan, and I was amazed when I found myself perfectly social, calling friends, basically the “best version” of myself that I use alcohol to achieve.

I was an alcoholic for the better part of a couple of decades and finally put the bottle(s) down in May of 2018. It was a battle - I knew for a long time that I was doing something that I didn't really want to do and that my actions were dictated by my addiction to booze. Looking back there are some funny stories, and even more embarrassing and sad ones. 

Almost every Monday I'd be at work telling myself I would not repeat the actions of the past weekend the coming weekend but I always would. My drinking went from weekends only to weekends + multiple days through the week. I had to buy only the maximum amount of booze I wanted to drink that day and there were many times I'd be up until 2AM drinking when I had to get up at 6 for work the next day. It really was a horrible existence. 

I tried to stop many times and then would always convince myself that I could moderate my drinking. ""I'll only drink on Fridays or Saturdays"". This would work for a bit and then I would gradually increase the amount and days of drinking until I was at my old levels - or worse. As the years went by I had to drink more and more often. It was pretty much the only thing I could look forward to.

Drinking played havoc on my goals in life. I'd have all these false beliefs about myself and life when drinking - it was exciting and I'd believe things that were never going to happen in reality (achieving lofty goals, starting my own business, making a lot more money, etc). 

When I quit I started believing in myself, believing in my ability to stop and change my life. I had to accept that alcohol was no longer an option and that I would have to face life and all of its challenges head on with no shortcut to escape reality. I would have to sit with it and be with my problems and challenges in life. It was scary but overtime I began to develop coping skills and strategies to deal with problems in healthier ways.",57,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5549864}"

I'm 38 years old and did not start drinking at all until I was 27 or 28. For a number of years it was social and not to excess, however the last 5 1/2 years there were excessive drinking on Friday nights, 5-7 beers. This was typically once a week. However, in March of 2020 with shutdowns happening, i began to drink more and on weekdays since my job changed from march until August 2020. Then I went back to weekend drinking only, but sometimes 10-12 beers on a friday night.

In late Dec 2020, after a weekend of excessive drinking, I began to have have abdominal and back pain. I went to my doctor and told him how I was feeling and about my drinking. He ran scans, blood work, etc, and things came back normal, and he believed I just had some muscular skeletal issues. 

Two moths went by and nothing changed pain wise, neither did my drinking because it appeared through bloodwork and scans that it wasn't the issue. I ended up going to the ER in March 2021 because of pain, they did CT scans on my organs with Contrast and Without, things looked fine. I was sent to a neurologist, I had MRI's done and things appeared fine.

So I haven't been drunk for 2 years, some of you know already. Still I can occasionally  feel very lonely, bored, depressed, down, deflated, defeated etc. And my immediate go to for this is: It must be the residual impact of being a heavy binge drinker for so long in the past and all the bad that came out of it. Or maybe it's because I no longer drink therefore I am no longer as sociable or as desirable to be around to others (even though at mu worst drinking I was defo not desirable to be around either.) Only now am I beginning to see that alcohol is maybe no longer the problem or rather my relationship with alcohol is no longer the problem and I shouldn't hold onto it as if it is. .

 I don't drink alcohol so there is no troubles that come from my drinking in my life at all so it can't possibly be alcohol for the way I feel sometimes. The problems have nothing to do with alcohol I don't think, I think it's just a very convenient thing for me to blame because that way I can offer myself an excuse for feeling bad and that kinda provides me with an additional excuse to just sit around and ""wait it out"" rather than actually moving my butt and dealing with each issue head on. 

I also think it's maybe dangerous to blame alcohol for too much after you have stopped drinking  because people like me can start to think that the absence of alcohol is the reason why their life is unsatisfactory... maybe its more practical and more effective and more honest to actually address each issue without taking alcohol into the equation at all after a certain length of time of continual abstinence. 

Like, If I feel lonely it iS because I am lonely and lacking in fulfilling healthy relationships. If I feel bored it's because I haven't found anything fulfilling to do with my time. If I feel depressed it's probably a reasonable emotional response to the condition of my life and the condition of myself at present. 

My question  is:

Since not drinking alcohol for a good length of time, do you still find yourself equating your problems to alcohol (or the absence of alcohol) instead of actually addressing the issues for what they are and dealing with them, excluding alcohol from the equation?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54572743}"

Before this incident, the last drink I had was last December when I had a few beers with no side effects whatsoever.

Last weekend I was drinking vodka by myself. I mixed it with water and lemon juice and sugar and made myself a hard lemonade. All in all, I ended up drinking maybe 150ml of vodka. (not entirely sure on the amount, just guessing based off the size of the bottle I had.) I drank this amount in about an hour window, and while I was drunk I noticed that my face had gone kind of numb and tingly. My friend told me that that that was normal whilst drinking so I didn't think anything of it. The only problem now is that it has been nearly a week and my face is still numb and tingly. I haven't had any drinks since but it just wont go away. I am planning on going to see the doctor asap but any input would be greatly appreciated.

Did I really drink enough to cause nerve damage? That isn't even the drunkest I've ever been, not even close. Nor is it the fastest I've consumed alcohol in one sitting. All in all, I'm pretty worried about the whole thing. I don't have any pain in my face but the pins and needles are pretty intense.

I know that alone this may or may not seem to be significant, but how they are going about this is what is concerning and making me think that they’ve developed a problem.  Or at least are heavily relying on alcohol as a crutch for their problems.  

To start, they lie about what they are doing.  They say they are going out with other friends or spending time with their family, but the only thing they have planned is to end up drinking at their bar of choice.  Note - they found out we knew this was going on so they started going to a different bar.

When they do this they are 100% alone.  They meet no one, but occasionally bring someone they’ve met home for a hookup.  They literally sit at the bar, order drink after drink, scroll their phone, and then drive home.  

They often leave their house late in the evening (9-10PM) and don’t return home from the bar until after 1AM most nights.  And they have to be at work by 9AM most days.  

They hide what they are doing very well.  Or at least they try.  They are a well established adult in their 30s who is intelligent, have a good but high stress job, and are a very calm person so most people would not know they have a problem.  I know that alcoholism does not discriminate though.

Being honest, I have 0% experience dealing with alcoholism.  I’m guessing most people will not say that any of this is normal?  Does anyone have a similar experience they can share and how they handled it?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6136188}"

But he was always so fun to be around. 

Anyway, just heard he died of some stomach issues last Friday. He had vomited blood a few weeks ago, but he chalked it up to drinking too much when taking his girlfriend out for her birthday. He'd had some fits like that before but he just shrugged it off because he could ""tough it out. Probably just a stomach bug"". 

He died alone at home after getting cut from opening the bar he was working at so he could settle his stomach. His girlfriend found him on the floor already cold. We still
don't know what caused it. They're having a service for him tomorrow. I can't make it but I wish I could. 

Look, a lot of us work in bars, or drank a lot in bars, or just drank/drink too much. And here in America, we are so afraid of the cost of preventative care or health insurance, we all have times where we should get checked out we ""tough it out"". 

Please don't let that fear get in the way of taking care of yourself. You can't do it if you never know what's wrong. If you CAN see a doctor, free clinic or whatever, please do. The people around you will have you around longer for it. And they love you a lot more than you know. I didn't know myself until I realized I'll never see him again.

I'm not a 'wild child', I've always been very quiet and shy. That grew into anxiety and depression. I struggle to even ask someone for help when I'm sober and often find it difficult to make new friends.

I don't think I've had a week without drinking in some capacity for 4 years and I'm finally done with it.
I'm sat right now in my bathtub because its the only place I feel like I'm not going to cave my head in because of the raging hungover headache I've got from last night. I haven't been able to eat much today without gagging, I've hardly left my bed and even standing up is a struggle.

I've had alcohol poisoning in the past where my parents had to make me vomit and my dad had to stay up with me throughout the night as they were scared I'd die. I used to think of that as a funny story but I don't anymore. Writing it out just makes me feel sad. 

I moved away from my support network around 10 months ago and now live in a different city. I moved with my then girlfriend who is as of 3 weeks ago my ex. Especially over the last few months I've found it hard to say no to drinking. We found some new friends who are also early 20s and all they do is drink. 3 or 4 nights in a pub a week plus a night out where the only way for it to end is if someone is crawling home. The city I live in is known for drinking and the people that live here have a massive tolerance for alcohol.

I've wanted to give up drinking in the past but people have laughed at me or said things along the lines of 'this is what young people do' and so I just continue drinking.

But I hate feeling this way. I hate how alcohol makes me confident and less anxious and that I know exactly where the buzz is and I keep chasing it, knowing full well I'll pay for it tomorrow. 

So although I've got a killer hangover right now, I'm going to attempt to crawl back to my bed, sleep it off, and start tomorrow as my first day of sobriety. And hope that I can make this last as I'm fed up wasting my days being hungover.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85317016}"

I have never been one to say I don’t have a drinking problem, I’ve always been aware but just can’t seem to stay away from alcohol.
It’s not really conditional like I have a bad day and go drink. It’s like once I allow myself the thought of buying a bottle, I’m determined to get it.
I live with my fiancé and my 3 kids, very busy all day, so I have to make up some stupid excuse to leave the house for like 5 minutes to secure the booze.
My family is supportive of me getting the help I need, I’ve gone to therapy done AA, always participating and trying to learn ways to get my mind back on track, but it’s like one day I’ll just wake up and be like “I’m drinking today” and then proceed to have a week long binge.
I can and do actually get away with it the first maybe 3 days, like no slurring, covering my tracks, not excessively drinking but usually around the 4th day of my bingeing, I up the stakes and buy bigger bottles, start drinking earlier, terrible hangovers.
That’s when everything gets ugly and I stop eating and start being obnoxious.
I HATE EVERYTHING that comes of my alcoholism, from the lying, to the sneaking cash, to the bloated feeling, to the soreness on random places of my body etc
Like there’s no enjoyment or happiness I get from drinking, it’s like impulsive not recreational for me
I romanticize alcohol, as if it’s this great cure, but there’s nothing I need to cure myself of besides alcohol.
It’s such a pathetic cycle
I get nothing out of it but nausea and distrust from loved ones.
I hate that I’m a slave to the bottle, I hate that I’m not always at 100% to help my wife with household stuff
It just has absolutely no benefit whatsoever
YET I still allow my mind to create that scenario where “a couple of shots won’t hurt”
But they always do hurt, not only myself but to the great support I have around me
Everyone just wants me to be the man that I used to be, the man that they counted on, the man that always put his family first
But it’s getting to the point where I’m putting this disgusting poison in my body over having a movie night with my fiancé 
I’m officially done now.
My body can’t do this, my mind can’t do this
The only way I’m ever going to be truly done is if I stick to COMPLETE ABSTINENCE, no drinking on holidays no special occasions, just never allowed to drink ever again, a thought that used to terrify me to be honest but I’m ready to hang this one up.
I can not and will not allow this to take away any more of my time, money or emotional well-being.

Today is day 1.
All I can ask for is a day 2.

Every time I quit, things got better, better jobs, family, better pay, etc.. Every time I drank, bad shit would begin to happen, divorce, DUIs, etc.  Always been a beer drinker, so it has been slow, very slow painful misery. Went in and out of AA many times but in the end I started drinking as soon as I got out of a meeting.  I simply quit going to AA meetings after that but I did learn a lot that I use to this day.

Moe recently, I got sober around August 2019. I did this simply by taking the Antabuse pill.  I know I get terribly sick if I drink on it. Anyways, when the virus showed up in March of last year, I ran out of the Antabuse and there was a global shortage of this pill (possibly because everyone was getting it prescribed from their doctors?). I checked 10 different pharmacies and they were out.  I thought I would just somehow stay sober. A few weeks passed and in April of last year I had this crazy urge and got drunk for three days straight.  Luckily after three days of drinking, a package arrived and it turned out to be the Antabuse pills.  Next day I was back on the pill and stayed sober until last week.

I made some serious positive changes since I quit drinking last year. I first quit smoking. Then I fixed my diet, eating only natural unprocessed foods (eating 10-15 servings of fruits and veggies) . I even quit sugar.  I had lost all the weight I wanted to lose and I was literally glowing.   I'm in my mid-50's and I was jogging/walking about 6-10 miles a day and also going to the gym one or two times a day.  My energy levels were amazing. Being 50+ years old and as an ex-smoker and alcoholic, I had a  bunch of small ailments, rashes, allergies, breathing issues, joint pain and what not.  But they all simply disappeared. Even my decades long foot-nail fungus just went away.  I bought a bench press, weights, etc. I was building some serious muscles and  beer belly was totally gone and my abs began to show.  I felt I  was in my mid-20's.  I even learnt to rollerblade a few months ago. I felt invincible.  By now I had totally forgotten alcohol had been my biggest problem in the past.

Fast forward to last week. I suddenly realized I hadn't  taken the pill for several days. The first thing I should have done is to go pop a pill but the thought struck me that it would be fun to go drink a six pack of beer. There it goes. I was drunk for three days straight. I drank between 12 to 18 beers everyday and felt like shit. I was also smoking and I ate whatever - fast food, pizza, hot dogs.  I also did a lot of stupid stuff like texting bizarre shit to people I barely knew.    I woke up yesterday and took a pill.  Sober for about 45 hours now but I still feel like crap about all the embarrassing texts I had sent and how I screwed up my sobriety and started smoking. 

I feel half-way human now but this binge  made me realize how easy it is for me to forget alcohol is my No.1 problem. I somehow feel I subconsciously planned to get drunk. Thank God I didn't get into any legal troubles.  Just wanted to vent and tell you all that getting drunk after staying sober for a while is absolutely not worth it,  I screwed up because I forgot how bad life was as an alcoholic and took sobriety for granted.  Going from a feeling of confidence and great health to feeling like an absolute hopeless piece of shit in a matter of 72 hours is horrible.

My anxiety usually turns to anger and self isolation. Everything pisses me off at times and I have nothing really to be angry about in reality. I get tired of feeling so fucking high strung.

I’m a 19y/o F living with my mum who has had an alcohol problem for 5 years, my dad and 21 y/o sister. My mums drinking has been getting worse over the past year and she is currently drinking a litre bottle of gin/around 26 units minimum everyday, even in the morning and during the night. 

She won’t accept she has a problem and refuses any sort of help, we have tried everything including pouring away or diluting her alcohol, I have begged her not to drink, contacted her doctor etc. She has refused help from CMHT (NHS mental health service) and any alcohol services. I feel my mum is psychologically and physically dependent on alcohol and is unable to stop and needs professional help but she won’t accept it. She seems to have developed a tolerance to alcohol and often doesn’t appear drunk to other people but we notice the subtle signs like her face looking red, her speech and her becoming verbally aggressive. 

I have mental health problems including aspergers and borderline personality disorder and am under adult mental health services in the Uk. This is taking a massive toll on my mental health and making me suicidal, I feel helpless. My mum is emotionally and financially abusive towards me and uses my benefit money to fund her alcohol addiction, I am afraid of her so I’m unable to get my money back. I realise my mum is unable to stop but I can’t help feeling angry towards her and then I feel guilty because that makes me selfish. 

My mum is driving after drinking daily and I’m extremely worried about her and other people’s safety, I don’t know what to do. I’m scared she is going to die from alcohol or end up harming someone else.

Warning: long post.

I'm going to give you a very brief breakdown of what has been happening first. I really hope this is allowed because I see my practitioner tomorrow and need to be prepared. My husband and I have been researching the benefits of psilocybin in addiction recovery. My therapist was unofficially very supportive. I live in a very religious and conservative state in the U.S. so finding people open to new science (or science in general) is rare. I took a massive ""theraputic"" dose of 'shrooms about 3 1/2 weeks ago. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time, but what came out of it was that I have as close to a perfect life as someone can hope for, with 2 daughters and a husband who adore me. So I've only had 3 bad days of drinking out of almost a month. That is absolutely life-changing for me, as a person who usually drinks 2-3 bottles of wine daily. The funny thing is that I am physically revolted at the thought and/or taste of alcohol now. I'm almost at the point of being completely AF, but the nausea is unbearable. I absolutely never vomit, even with a stomach bug. Since the 'shrooms, I vomit almost daily. The alcohol helps with that if I can manage to keep it down. (I know it is related to withdrawal from cutting down.) I'm seeing my primary care nurse practioner tomorrow to discuss everything, and she isn't exactly friendly or judgment-free. I'd love to be able to ask for a prescription for anti-nausea meds. The U.S. seems to be one of the only places where you can't walk into you GP and ask for help with stopping drinking. I know we are a litigious country, but damn.

But here's some backstory.. its a bit vague and only a summary of what happened but here goes..

I am 33. I drank so much and missed out on so much of my daughters early life it makes me ill. I am now so far away from her. I have slowly began reconciling with my ex wife, who I put through hell, But the damage to my family was done. I love my little girl so much. How could I do this? How the fuck could I choose alcohol over my little girl? I have lost my friends and family's respect. I lost my opportunity to be a great and present Dad and haven't seen my girl in over a year. I'm haunted by my decisions in life and by my actions. The violence. The betrayal. The infidelity. The nightmarish situations I put myself in. The regret and remorse of what I've put my ex wife and children through and others who have been affected by me.

I was a listerine drunk and a needle addict. I could be dead or in prison or on the street. For that I am grateful. But I feel like I am living in a prison of my own mind of my own making. I want to revive my spirit. I want to come back and make a difference. But how could I do that after falling so low? What the hell is wrong with me? All the warning signs were there and I ignored them.. for YEARS.

The positives- I am sober. I have a decent job and renting a place.. I have a cool girlfriend. I cannot be ungrateful for these things given where I could be. I am not currently in any legal trouble thank God.

I believe alcohol is a demon that is hell bent on destroying my life. I believe I've even seen the demon before in bad cases of delirium tremens. Thats a whole different story. I feel like even though I have gotten sober, the demon has won because my life is shattered from what it could/should have been. But I have not given up. I dont even know what keeps me going at this point.. maybe the faint hope that I will be present in my daughters life again and get to be close to her again. 

I am trying to accept this new life after admitting defeat and find comfort in the blessings I have. But maybe constantly seeking comfort from my pain is what got me here. Maybe I'm meant to feel this way.

Naltrexone question.,"I was put on naltrexone 50mg a week ago i.e. last Tuesday, by a doctor in de-addiction centre referred by my psychiatrist in a government hospital here. Today I went to see my psych, and she, who is a resident, sometimes talks to this another douchebag doctor when it comes to my alcohol and he doesn't ask me about anything else other than when did I last drink and how much. So I was expecting that question today too, I told him that I had two beers last Saturday. 

So they both started talking and he told me he cannot continue naltrexone (de-addiction clinic here gives them free on recommendation but I don't mind purchasing them either even a bit costly) if I will drink in future as they can have a reaction. I was jaw dropped. Isn't that how naltrexone supposed to work? I am glad I didn't tell him about other two times I had beer in last week. And with each time my craving for second beer after first reduced. 

So I told him politely that if I could just stop drinking, I would not need naltrexone, would I? And since last two days I have been feeling better, I credit it to naltrexone partially so don't want them stopped. 

He didn't stop it but told me to not drink on it as he knew more than me being a doctor (the reason I hate doctors, especially psychiatrists, full of ego) and the reaction could be very bad for my body. I am pretty sure I am going to drink at least 4-5 times in next 15 days, which if not for naltrexone I would probably drink all 15 days, and once I see him in two weeks I will just lie that I didn't touch alcohol.

So please someone tell me is there any possibility that I am completely wrong and doctor is absolutely right, and naltrexone+beer can kill me or make me severely sick?

What should I do?

The hospital is free being government and all and most doctors are really qualified too, not sure about intelligence though, I can switch my psychiatrist again, but I don't wanna do this again and again as I am not gonna explain everything again to someone. I visit them only for benzodiazpenes as SSRIs do not work on me, and today I heard them planning to stop clonazepam after next visit which is SOS even now, so guess there won't be any point then visiting there.

The last alcoholic beverages I consumed was on Christmas day last year but I didn't have enough to effect me. 

The benefits:


I haven't done anything terrible or embarrassing while blackout drunk in over two years and I am not experiencing any level of anxiety at all. 

I am much more daring and creative than I used to be. 

My significant other is seldom truly, deeply upset with me over anything. 

My relationship with my significant other has never been better and has gone from strength to strength. 

Financially I have been able to spend money on clothes and bits and pieces that I have wanted instead of scraping together cash for the pub or the shop for alcohol. 

I enjoy food more. I enjoy coffee more. There isn't much I am not grateful for or things that seem trivial to me. 

Negatives :

I have literally no friends I spend time with. 

I haven't been on a night out with a group of like minded people in almost a decade. Maybe longer.

I struggle socially with people way more without alcohol  (even people that I used to call friends that keep in touch over the phone and on email) and I have absolutely no ability to make meaningful friendships.

I feel a bit restricted as to where I can go and what I can do without being the stone faced boring one. I find difficulty engaging in events where alcohol is present such as live music and the theater. 

I occasionally still find that I want to drink socially because despite all the disasters it once caused me, I find myself quite bored and quite lonely sometimes and sometimes feel as though I want to have a silly conversation  with a stranger in a pub. 

Weekends no longer hold any meaning to me.

Days off of work have very little value to me aside from recording music and gaming.

I am surrounded by alcohol and people who drink including my own family and its almost unavoidable to witness or feel the temptation to join in unless I keep doing what I do which is stay in a state of social suicide. 

All in all, I feel fucked if I don't and even more fucked if I do. 

My not drinking  feels more like its just an avoidance of disaster more than it is an actual reach toward a desirable life. A desirable life would feel different to this I think but it certainly wouldn't be what it was either. A bit perplexed at this.

All the programs we can find are also heavy in the religious side. That's not for him as he had some personal issues with those in religion. It ended in a sucide attempt after some very nasty texts from the sponsor over refusing to go to church. That AA place was told and shown the msgs and the outcome. Tho that doesn't help my friend and his feelings about the situation or AA.

He is seeking therapy. He is seeking help from the GP. So hopefully mentally and physically he can do the hard yards there. He calls me vs goes to the bottle shop. Or try that again. 

As someone who's his friend and also a big source of I can't deal can I just chat to distract, what more can I do. 

I'm helping with seeking employment (c19 locked down ATM tho phasing out), I'm simply just there for any random msg or call, I sat out a lot of his cold turkey detox on the phone with him, and that was fucking awful and just scary when the shakes side hit. 

He would go to AA if it wasnt church related, we've spoken at length about this even before, but when we look up AA they are all church based, is there something I'm missing looking it up. The drs suggestions are also heavily church based and he's got some serious pushback there. 

He's also coming here for his first weekend in 2yrs sober. I've not let him be around me or my child since I recognised the issue and he spends most weekends totally fucked up. I plan that we just go get out in our allowed nature shit, have some fun that way, teach him some new cooking shit and try to just occupy his mind. If he can stay sober I plan to keep on this, as outdoors is something he likes, my kid lives for, I can go along with, plus the cooking. Cooking because he's always shown a like, but hasn't explored. 

I understand I cannot prevent not blame myself if in the week he relapses, I'm pushing him back to the gym, to communicate openly with me when he's not okay, and he has been which I think was apart of him agreeing to detox at all. He has esteem issues stemming from his relationship breaking down over the drinking, she cheated vs either leave or ever try help him with this issue. 

Knowing we are getting the mental and physical helped. My plans that he comes to a dry situation for the weekends, what is there, picking the gym weekdays up again and hopefully cooking some damn good stuff, else I can or could do to help. 

I understand that there's likely a dependable nature being placed on me with all this, and I'd like some advice as to how to sorta set that aside and be a friend, but also encourage, support and help his situation as he goes through this journey. 

Other friends are more down, but have 2 drinks with us. Which I don't think and he doesn't agree is acceptable. Hence my pushing gym, classes, meet new people.

I didn’t start drinking regularly until the start of the pandemic much like many other people in the world. I drank to forget about the shit show going on and my work schedule compared to my wife’s meant I was home alone often.

I started slow with a little bit of vodka every night, shifted to two four lokos every night or so, to a pint of vodka a night for a few months. I noticed I had a problem about a year ago, when I was going to bed and realized something weird. 

I hadn’t remembered actually saying goodnight or trying to fall asleep in a while. I had been passing out from alcohol for a while to the point I couldn’t remember any nights.

I started trying to slow down and have made strides, only to go back to it and hit some of my lowest points in front of friends I wish never had to see it.

I drink a lot less, at a pint of vodka in one day and then a few days off with a beer or two in between and soon hope to get to nothing but a drink to relax. 

It feels daunting though.

The amount that I drank makes me feel as if my body will never recover by doing so much so fast. I have high cholesterol and blood pressure and nausea often. I am nervous I’ve wrecked my mid 20’s body and will suffer the rest of my life for one really terrible year. It makes me want to drive right back to the alcohol and it’s tough.

I didn't drink alcohol at all, and then I decided that if I can stop for 3 weeks than I can definitely stop for more. So I did, but not completely. Sometimes, probably 4 out of 7 days I drink 1 beer, maybe 2, but definitely not more. I like the taste of it, it feels good, but I'm not even thinking about getting drunk or even tipsy, and I don't drink the second one (if there's a second one) after I finished the first. There's usually 4-5 hours between the two and I can honestly say that I feel a LOT better. I used to have constant diarrhea every single day, I went to sleep drunk, and when I woke up, even though I slept for 8 or more hours, I had no energy during the day which really affected my work performance. But luckily I'm able to stop myself whenever, and it did nothing but good to me. I drank because I felt better, felt more confident, and was less depressed, and I really didn't think that I was gonna stop anytime soon, if ever. But as it turned out I didn't really need it. Sure it helped for a couple of hours, but the rest was even worse. So if you read this for this long, I just wanna say that just try what I did, and stop for a week. Maybe it helps and you'll be able to stop yourself as well. But I know that this won't help everyone, it's not this simple. The only thing that I can say for sure, is that you will feel a lot better, trust me. After the second week, you're gonna realize it and you won't even crave for alcohol. You can drink a couple a day, that's not a problem. Just know that things will be better once you stop drinking.",14,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.54585224}"

I've seen family members with severe alcoholism and understand the consequences it brings.

I drink 1-4 drinks per night 2-6 days per week. Sometimes I'll go an entire week or more without a single drink. It's always me drinking expensive fancy beers, sweet wines, or mixed drinks. Anything I drink is flavor based. I'm never drinking to drink or get drunk. At most I will get a light buzz and either stop completely or ride the buzz with water or other non alcoholic beverages in between even if I drink 10-15 beverages over the course of a party. I've had like 2-3 hangovers this year and have only puked once (while partying on burbon Street in New orleans) in the past 2 years. In my life I've only ever missed 1 day of work because I've been too hungover. I've never driven drunk or did anything I would regret while drinking. Never started a fight or argument because I wasn't sober. I'm 26 and am a fully functional member of society with a house, 2 cars, kid, and wife.

I feel like I drink too much, but I am neither dependent on it nor has it affected my life in any way other than being an expensive habit. Also, I haven't increased consumption over the years, it just fluctuates. Times of stress the consumption is highers but never to the point where it seems to become a problem. Then when things get back to ""normal"" the consumption is reduced.

I'm sure it can't be great for my body, but from a functional standpoint I have no issues and am in the best point of my life financially and family based.

I was driving drunk after walking my dog and I took a curve very fast.  I drove 4 miles and pulled into my driveway before I realized my dog wasn't with me.  I drove back along the road until I found some good samaritans keeping him company.  I quickly grabbed him and left.  The cops came to my home about a half-hour later and I ran into the woods while I let my parents, who were totally unaware anything had happened, deal with them.  My parents were unhappy, to say the least.  Woody was my best friend and it really shook me that I had endangered him so.

&#x200B;

Last week Woody died a natural death from a tumor that had been metastasizing in his belly for a few years.  I had the honor of accompanying him to the vet and I kept him comfortable until he was gone.  I am so grateful I was sober and had the opportunity to say goodbye to him with dignity and a clear head.

&#x200B;

After I sobered up I enrolled in community college after a decade of working unfulfilling jobs for people who only cared about the bottom line.  I am studying to write fiction.  When I was a child in an abusive home books were my solace.  I intend to offer the same solace to my readers.  I now know that I needed these two-plus decades of drinking in order to prepare me with empathy for those who have suffered abuse and alcoholism.  I have a plethora of experience with addiction and mental illness and I can relate to anyone who is going through it.  Know that you are not as alone as you feel and that you can start trying to change any day you choose, but it takes more than effort.  You have to find a reason to live to fight the illness you have.

&#x200B;

And it is an illness.  Alcoholism is a disability covered by The Americans with Disabilities act.  Many if not most alcoholics have complicated mental or physical ailments that can not be properly treated if the alcoholism is not addressed.  It is illegal to discriminate against alcoholics just the same as it is illegal to discriminate against someone who is blind.  There are many doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors who are trained specifically to help alcoholics.  I am not totally discounting AA or other groups of that ilk, but they did nothing for me but help me delude myself into believing I had a 'spiritual' problem.  If the idea of a gawd or a higher power sounds like hooey to you, you can and should get help.  Being a materialist (in the philosophical  manner) does not preclude you from getting treatment. There is no one way to recover that works for everyone and you may need to try a multitude of options before you find the right combination.  For me, it is therapy, a success coach, and a mother who is caring and understanding in a way that I know many family members of alcoholics are not. You do you, but you need to reach out and ASK for help.  In some situations, you may need to DEMAND help.

I was in grad school when the pandemic hit so all my classes transitioned to online. I started drinking during classes. Many of my friends and colleagues would also drink during our classes and joke about it in group chats and I started to noticed my alcohol consumption increase significantly so I think that’s where things really started to go downhill. 

Once things reopened in the spring my husband and I slowed down our drinking significantly but since I’ve started a new job and there have been a lot of changes in my life and I have turning to alcohol to relieve stress. I also have been finding it hard to stop and would binge with friends on the weekends. 

I tried to “quietly” quit at the end of July because I felt my drinking was getting unhealthy. My parents are both alcoholics and there were times when I was growing up I had to be the adult and look after my siblings when my parents were really struggling with alcohol. I didn’t want to “announce” I was quitting because I thought it might cause drama and was waiting until the right time. I was actually hiding that I wasn’t drinking by putting soda water or Diet Coke in a cup with ice so it looked like I had a mixed drink. 

All that was going well until I went over to friends house. She was drunk when my husband and I showed up and she started getting combative. I was sober (she didn’t know that) and tried to de-escalate the situation. Long story short, I pointed out she had a lot to drink and that’s when all hell broke loose. She yelled at me and then took off. I was so rattled I drank 3 beers way too quickly. I told my husband I needed to go to bed immediately because I was scared I would drink more. We were supposed to stay the weekend but the next morning I left without talking to her. 

Later that day I messaged apologizing and told her I wanted to talk it out but I asked her not to drink before or during the conversation. At that time I told her that I was struggling with alcohol and that I’d like to not be around it. She told me I was a liar and if I really had a problem I would have told all my family and friends and that I was actually accusing her of being an alcoholic. I tried to explain my request had nothing to do with her but she refuses to talk to me and hasn’t to this day.

After that day I had quit drinking altogether for about a month before having a relapse. I thought I could have one or two drinks with some friends but it quickly turned into 2 bottles of wine. That night I slipped and fell and broke my ankle. I know this is a HUGE sign that I need to quit for good. So I talked to my husband about going to a group (I’m not comfortable with AA). But my husband thinks that I’m just clumsy and that I would have fell regardless if I had been drinking. 

I feel like I have to convince people that I’m an alcoholic. I don’t score very highly on the problematic drinking tests/quizzes , but I feel like it’s a slippery slope. I don’t want to go down the same road as my parents and I don’t want to become dependent on it. I don’t know who to talk to.

All of these things, plus dehydration and electrolyte depletion due to extreme southern heat and nearly constant sweating became the perfect storm and I had a severe TC seizure that I was told during which I nearly aspirated on my own saliva, and lasted about two minutes in the clonic stage.

Fortunately I was at home with several people who have had experience with people who have frequent seizures and knew to help me to bed after lying me gently on the ground and turning my head to the side.

EMTs came and did their thing and I declined medical treatment because I knew I was mostly fine, minus a tweaked back and mildly sprained ankle and I have no insurance at the moment.

The weird thing about it all is that I haven't had any desire whatsoever to drink today and the mere thought of it repulses me. Usually I couldn't wait to go grab another can or bottle of liquor just to enjoy the buzz.

I got home and had an argument with my boyfriend. We fought for hours, and this morning I woke up with a bruised and cut up nose. I have no recollection of it. He laughed a little because apparently I fell at some point and smacked my face.

It literally ALWAYS ends poorly, but I never learn. 

I recently learned about the phenomenon of ""euphoric recall"" in therapy. My Gremlin only remembers the brief period of instant gratification and filters out all the shitty parts: feeling ill all of the time, ruining my reputation, CRIMES, hospitalization, losing friends. 

Sometimes my Gremlin is subdued; sometimes he takes the reins. Tonight was hard. I just started a new job and it's come to the point where my new coworkers are inviting me out and I have to decline. I've told them I'm in recovery and they're very understanding, but the FOMO is real. I miss the days when I ~thought~ I was able to drink socially. The truth is that it always ended in a mess.

2 years alcohol free here. Just got back from a date at a trendy restaurant. Being hip and all, water was served out of liquour bottles. ex. our table had a tequila bottle with water inside.

Even though I'm sure this tequila bottle had been cleaned out, it still made me nervous to drink water that had been in the same container as tequila. I did just want to go with the flow and so drank water out of this tequila bottle.

The water tasted like water, nothing funny about it, etc. But I am thinking about alcohol now - probably just a placebo effect. But I'm wondering if I could have ingested any tequila or other alcohol from this?

TLDR: IS it safe for recovering alcoholics to drink water out of tequila or vodka bottles that have been cleaned and refurbished as water containers?

It sounds like an extremely small step, but it’s been at least six hours and I’ve barely finished the one I had. I feel good about it.

I haven't even started my job at this company yet and despite knowing my limits I drank too much and blacked out (my phone wasn't recording steps and my watch died. I could have been anywhere and said anything for hours for all I know). Ever since I've been living in anxiety and at one point had convinced myself I'd said something offensive and unforgivable to someone, I'm still unsure. I have no means of knowing as I hadn't met anyone there before so don't have casual social contact with anyone.

I've not heard anything from the company since so don't believe there are any significant consequences (it's been a full week) however the wider the problem is how to I stop myself hitting the point of no return. I blackout regularly when drinking relatively heavily so I have really made an effort to cut back and go alcohol free or ensuring I'm having waters/skipping rounds, however this time I did neither. When blacking out has happened in the past I've often done stupid things with consequences so I'm still convinced I will suffer for this. 

On this occasion I felt social pressure to fit in and be interesting and my anxieties got the better of me, I felt a need to participate as I knew absolutely nobody. When I needed to be present and realise I was overdoing it my mind wasn't there to check myself.

I need help before it's too late if it's not already. I thought I was on a good path however I've really let myself down and could have really messed things up here. I'm afraid that I will do this again and destroy my relationships/career.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.83012545}"

He doesn't admit (well, he admitted once) and walks away on anyone who wants to talk about it with him. He refuses help. Recently he said he didn't know why he did it (drinking) and that he was gonna stop. Of course he wouldn't be able to do it by himself, but he denied external help like AA or a psychiatrist; and of course he started drinking again in less than a month. 

Now, I don't live with him. In fact, I live in another state, but I'm visiting and I'm close to his house. We were supposed to travel together, but because he is drinking heavily again, I called it off and told him about it. But I still want to sit down and talk to him, in person, and be serious about this. I've scheduled and paid for a psychiatrist for him to go on Monday. So this would be the talk: I want to help you, please admit you need help, the psychiatrist it paid for. 

But what is the best way to say this? I don't know how to talk in way that is 1) loving; 2) effective and 3) serious, having in mind that he is been an alcoholic for almost 30 years. What should be my approach? How not to offend him or get him defensive? 

In his shoes, what would you like to hear from your daughter or anyone close to you that wants to help you? Or, if you're not a (recovery/recovered) alcoholic, have you ever helped anyone in this manner and what did work for you?

If it wasn’t for my anxiety I wouldn’t need to drink. But after waking up 5 or 6 times to a panic attack in the middle of night last night, I caved and drank. Anyone else have unbearable anxiety and panic attacks when they try to quit?
