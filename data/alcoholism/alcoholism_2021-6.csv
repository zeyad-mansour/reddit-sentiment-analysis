Then the relationship broke down after seven years, got back in to stupid amounts of coke a day (talking over £1k a day towards the end), pulled my shit together again and was fine again. Then I stupidly got back with the ex and she'd become an alcoholic when we were apart, next thing I know I'm drinking four bottles of wine or a litre of bourbon every night. Split six months later and I was in and out, wouldn't drink for a week or two, then go mental for months. I had it in my head though that if I overcame a very hardcore drug addiction I'll get past the drink. One of those lies addiction tells you. I'm also bipolar (mainly up) which doesn't help. 

Not even sure what triggered it but suddenly hit me I need some fucking help. AA isn't for me, I want to be able to pop down the pub and have a few with my mates, or a cold one after work, but leave it there, not go fucking mental with it. So I contacted a local recovery group yesterday, had a phone call today discussing all this (and personal things I'd rather not disclose here), they're having a staff meeting tomorrow to decide the best course of action they can provide me and then I'll be starting next week.

I posted about a month ago speaking about how I've achieved nothing at the age of 31.
Since then I have seriously cut down on my alcohol intake. I've stopped drinking alone and actually after a month I no longer *crave* a drink.
I have a close friend with whom I have a drink with once a fortnight or so. We tend to have 4-6 cans of beer each, talk about our lives, put the world to rights and bitch about our annoying acquaintances and colleagues.
I went and visited a friend I haven't seen since before lockdown and we went out and got drunk. I spent a lot more money than I should have, but I had a good time, I still had enough for the essentials and I didn't wake up feeling as though I'd disgraced myself. 
This is all really positive, however what I'm most proud of is that I've gone and got myself a hobby. 
I had a few flute lessons as a child and thought I'd try and pick up where I left off. I bought a beginner's flute for £70, an impossibility a few months ago. I never had money for anything before, £70 was far too much for clothes or hobbies or driving lessons  (Though I would happily drop £40-70 a week on booze and coke.)
My flute arrived and I've been playing 3-5 times a day for 10-40 minutes each time. I'm progressing and learning and being challenged and it feels AMAZING. Im achieving something guys. I have a hobby. When people ask me what my hobbies are I can say something other than ""socialising"" "" ""drinking""or ""partying""

I drank from morning until sunset, with family, then a friend at a restaurant then they left and I went over to another bar. It wasn't planned, but that's the point. I was drunk and stupid by the time I got a call to hang out... I just felt lonely and bored after only getting a short time with my friend and without skipping a beat chased the buzz. 

I hung out all day with old barflys and by evening was so drunk I annoyed others walking on way out, bouncer came over. I told him to fuck off...things escalated. Luckily it cooled down and waited for ride but I've never been like that. 

I've never been confrontational or mean like that. I feel so ugly just thinking about my behavior and its scary how much my brain was just checked out all day, I didn't think anything except where's the next drink.

Got sick in bed, it's a mess, just, no words.

All my friends drink and too much. I hear all this talk about quitting but then days later same old shit and I'm right there as well. (to be clear we agree to not drink when I visit then it just becomes pushing drinks even when I say no, which means time to move on) 

I want to quit, I feel like I lose parts of myself every time I'm obnoxious, sloppy, gross. There's just always some excuse past day 4,5 or 6 to drink and by then the guilt and anxiety is gone. 

I feel like the worst is when you think you have a handle on things but it's really just you're buzzed and don't notice it. Chasing that drunk. 

It seems like I'm just surrounded by drinking and ill have to isolate from almost everyone I know just to not be tempted. 

Some of my friends even encourage it while being upset when I throw up in their bathrooms...Have a hangover for days. I get bitched out for not wanting drinks hungover and miserable...happens often different groups. 

I really just hate being a drunk, what it looks like to others. It feels like shame and disappointment.

Her recent trough in her cycle has left her with a fractured knee and she's currently in a short-term post-hospital physical rehab facility.

**What options exist to get her the long-term care she needs?** She is still generally able to handle day-to-day tasks when she's not in the lowest points in her alcoholism cycle, but when she's on a downturn she'll end up laying in the floor for days, semi-conscious, unable to move or function. Are there options to have a professional check in on her frequently who can quickly/pro-actively identify when she's on a downward slope and intervene? Would a long-term assisted living facility type of option be the best route?

Potentially relevant info:

* She has yet to admit to herself/others she has alcoholism (blames her issues on the side effects of the alcoholism, not realizing the root cause)
* Due to a myriad of reasons, she is reluctant to accept any type of help that's not just an enablement. She will be extremely averse to the idea of moving out of her home, even if it's in her best interest.
* She has some elderly family that live nearby, but who are unequipped to provide all the care she needs
* Her closest relatives, myself and my sister, live out of state
* Only income source is social security
* She has Medicare and a supplemental AARP insurance plan
* She is a resident of Ohio
* I have some medical and financial Power of Attorney for her",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6637491}"

I'm 36 now, and I've never been that clean since I was 12, so it has taken a lot of redefining. I've basically had to rethink how I see and do almost EVERYTHING. Sleep, friendships, sex, work, evenings, etc. It's been a lot, but I do feel very proud for making it this far. 

Unfortunately, one thing I feel like I'll never be able to fix will be my heavy guilt and shame for how my selfish actions affected others. Right now, that guilt is hitting extra hard. Last June, my grandmother died from stomach cancer. Tomorrow will be her memorial. We delayed it for this long for Covid reasons. I know she loved me very much, and even up to her last days, she would continue to talk about how all she wanted was for my cousins and I to be ok. She was an incredibly selfless, graceful and strong woman. After my grandfather had a stroke, she started working for the first time EVER in her forties at a video rental spot. Eventually, she decided to go back to school and got better grades than any of us. All while continuing to work and being an amazing grandmother, wife and person. In a family of fuckups and through a life of tragedy, she somehow always managed to stay strong, composed and loving. I still can't comprehend how. 

Not only did I not manage to get sober before she died, but the last few years were easily my most consistently destructive and selfish. What has been eating me up inside is how not only did she not get to see me begin to recover and thrive, but how most of my own memories of and with her in recent years are cloudy at best. Due to my long history of substance abuse and head injuries, my memory and cognition have been severely damaged. I'll never get back that clarity of experiences with her, and she'll have never been able to see me get well. It hurts so much. 

I'm mostly writing this because I don't know how I'm going to respond at the memorial, and I do have a history of panic attacks and other physical responses that can be triggered by certain things due to childhood trauma. I'm also writing this, though, to advise and share any support for those that are in the same boat and those that haven't been able to make the jump, yet. Trust me I know how physically and mentally insurmountable it seems, but you really can do it. There is support waiting for you. Also, if you can't find it in yourself, yet, to want more for your health and future, do it for the sake of those you have and will hurt on this path. The damage only gets worse and the actions only more unforgivable. I've felt a lot of serious pain in my life, but this pain over never getting the chance to show her what I could still do and be is by far one of the worst.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56635725}"

If he’s not working with that day, (whether it’s Monday or Sunday) he will start drinking by 2-3pm. He bought a big bottle of captain from Costco for himself, took him 7 alone to finish it. For me, it was when we were at a family party last summer where he got so wasted he ended up peeing his pants in front of everyone and eventually fell down in the front yard walking back to the car. It’s an everyday thing and it is driving me insane. He’s by no means a threat when he’s drunk, just a silly immature excuse for a grown man. It’s become so hard for me to even be in the same room as him, let alone having a conversation. It seems like he’s always been this way according to members of my family so in my opinion its not worth the energy to bring up because we all know he’s always been this way and won’t change.

Sometimes it feels like I drink so that I can hate on myself because I deserve it. Sober me doesn't do it, so drunk me has to.

I speak my mind and say what I mean, even if I'm a bit abrasive at times.

Back story on him and why he abuses alcohol: his dad wasn’t quite the father figure, his mom got his brother into meth and now his brother is schizophrenic and not all there, and his ex of 10 years was a crazy, evil psycho.. And here is our story: We were together for 2 years and in the beginning he struggled with cocaine and alcohol.. but as he quit the cocaine the drinking got progressively worse. We used to drink together all the time and I thought it was normal (back story on me (29 f) — I come from a family of alcoholics on my dads side, my dad was alcoholic until the day he died, and when I drink, I usually drink until I black out).
When we moved in together I noticed that he would disappear for a night and then come back home and sleep all day, fast forward to now, I found out he’d be out and binge drink all night, then come home to sleep it off. Recently, we had a conversation about this and I said this is the last straw (as it started happening more often), he needs to get help… he agreed, stopped drinking, seen a therapist virtually once a week and attended virtual AA meetings. A few weeks later he relapsed, however, this was the worst one. He left, cut the world off and binged for 5 days straight. I received email text saying, “I just want to die” about 3 days in. His step sister and I went out looking for him, his friends and family were worried. I didn’t know what to do. He finally came back. We talked about getting serious help again, and I decided to break it off. (Though, we just got an apartment together and now he sleeps on the couch..) Every time I bring up getting help and send him resources, he says: “I’m doing this at my own pace”. I can understand that. It’s been several weeks and he hasn’t been drinking, but a couple days ago he started drinking again and I am not sure what to do, or how I can help him. I feel that he is depressed and I try to push him to get help, but if he’s not ready, what do I do? Just let drink again? Keep asking him to get help?

My son (26) has had a 'drinking problem ' and a heavy pot use habit since he was about 18 or 19. He has massive social anxiety brought on by his Asberger's/high functioning autism and he claims the only way he can loosen up and talk to people is by getting drunk. He thinks he's witty and charming when he's wasted but doesn't realize the room is laughing AT him not with him. His benders (3-4 nights a week these days) nearly always end up with him blacking out.

He washed out of 2 different colleges in 2 years that he had full scholarships to. He used to be a very talented vocalist. Since then he's drifted around low-paying mainly laborer jobs with zero future. As his depression has worsened, he pushes me (and my wife) away. Blames all his problems on everything under the sun except himself and his drinking and smoking. He's been fired as a result of random drug tests.

I know now that I have been a huge enabled for pretty much his entire life. I've never let him crash and burn, or I've at least cushioned his fall. Now, he blames most of his problems on my wife and I. 

He got arrested for DWI about 3 years ago. I once again enabled by stepping in and finding him a lawyer to get him off. I've pulled him out of ditches multiple times before the police got to him.

Last week, we had a serious talk about his future.  He's almost 26 and he's going to lose his health insurance (under our policy) and we told him that he needs to find a job with benefits (which he won't do because all of THOSE jobs drug test) or go back to school. Together we identified a 2 year program in the town where my wife and I live that was agreeable to him. He was leaving his town this morning at 8am to make the 4.5 hr drive to tour the school.

Well, he felt (at 7 am) that it would be a good idea to pound some shots (his words)before he hit the road. About halfway through his trip a county sheriff nailed him, and now he's in jail.

He blew a 0.23 in the field and a 0.19 some time later back at the station. Where we live, anything over a 0.2 is a 3rd degree DWI and comes with a mandatory minimum 30 day jail sentence. He blew a 0.23 AFTER over 2 hours since the drinks. Damn.

He called and we refused to get him out. The Sheriff said he's going to have a hearing Monday where they basically present him with a charging document and will be released until his trial. When he leaves there he's going to be on some sort of Bluetooth alcohol monitoring wristband.

Sigh. So thats where we are now. With the massive depression, anxiety, and now NO ability to drink , my wife and I are terrified he's going to take his own life before his trial. His depression is severe and he will not do any kind of treatment. 

He won't do AA because he is a full-tilt atheist and says ""AA is going to shove God down his throat"". Other options have been presented and similarly dismissed for similarly foolish reasons.

I’m stuck in this being sober me that is reserved (and in a sense boring me) vs. buzzed/ drunk me who becomes friends with everyone immediately and is approachable because I have no filter.

My livelihood is that outgoing version who uses alcohol as a way to break out of my sober shell of being a home-body. Most people have no idea I am buzzed or drunk and have just assumed this is me naturally at this point.

I am working on opening my own business but without alcohol I am a very numbers and total “engineer“ and not the most socially-acceptably person. As in odd/ statistics and history based reasoning for everything... alcohol has made me likeable the last 15 years and made doing things easier.

I am honestly at a loss on how to be myself; an approachable-likeable version of myself sober when I have depended on alcohol to drop those walls for me for the past 15 years. To numb those voices in my head who say that I’m unattractive, not worthy of success, or friendly.

We broke up years ago because of her reckless behavior and recently got back together because she had finally taken it seriously (or so I thought)

She has done a fairly good job at turning her life around except for one thing.  She continues to maintain her friendships with the people that encourage her to drink and made her an alcoholic in the first place.  These people have encouraged her to drink the one day a month when she tests after her test because she can pass the test the next month since it is a month away.   Obviously this scares me that she is doing what she can to continue to drink. she tells me she doesn't need it ( what alcoholic doesn't say that).

My dad almost lost his job few years before retiring.

Like every night (almost) drinking. For the first year, I really only stuck to beers with the occasional bottle of whiskey. Beers got me good, drunk, and bubbly. They still do! However, these past six months I've been buying more and more bottles of liquor. I hate the feeling of being so bloated when I wake up from drinking a shit ton of beer, so the liquor buying has been more extreme as of here recent. 

Well, not too extreme necessarily. Like I'd say I go through about 3 bottles a month. Or, well, I used to. In the past month, I've been through a bottle of Old Grandad and went through another entire liter of it in four or five days last week, and I'm currently almost through my 114 proof version of the same whiskey 3 days into getting it. It says it's 750 ml. I plan on buying more after. 

What gets me is that I used to have to take pauses after getting so drunk the night before. Like I'd take a day where I didn't drink because I felt so hungover, nauseous, and wobbly. But now I wake up with, at the worst, a stomachache and I'll be fine to drink later on in the evening after I get everything done. I actually feel better drinking liquor now than I do beer. Sometimes I'll take a few shots before work if I'm having a bad day. And I just don't know if I should be worried over the lack of not having hangovers anymore? I don't think I've experienced any withdrawal symptoms? I mean I've drank every night for a while now, whether it's beer or liquor, but then again wouldn't you feel withdrawal symptoms sooner than that? I usually go through my whole day before drinking again. Usually a 12-15 hour pause.

Wish I could help but it's none of my business. Does anyone have any advice?,"tl;dr my neighbour drinks a lot and I'm concerned.  Don't know how to approach him or if I even should because I don't know him.

We barely speak to our upstairs neighbour.  I mean we say hello, but in a year I've never had even small-talk with him although he seems sound.  There's an unspoken agreement that we take turns with the wheelie bins, he makes minimal noise and occasionally we accept packages for each other.  Great neighbour basically.

Like I say, we share bin duty, so I'm not being nosy; I cannot help but notice his glass bin filling up with bottles of Bucky at a concerning rate.

*(For those of you not from Scotland, Buckfast is a fortified red wine full of sugar and about 5 coffees' worth of caffeine.  It's popular among teenagers because it tastes like cough syrup and makes you loud, obnoxious, and aggressive.  I think it's the caffeine but you don't feel nearly as drunk as you act -- which makes it quite a puzzling choice for drinking alone, which is what this guy is doing.)*

I realise this is nosy, judge me if you want, but the guy seems to be averaging roughly a bottle a day.  That to me is pretty heavy duty solo-drinking.

I worry about him cause although everybody is different, I think his circumstances tempt a problem developing.  He's (I think) a single guy, lives alone, around 30, works for the NHS (must be brutal right now), mature student (I can say from experience is brutal right now).

I hate to see this guy develop a problem and I wish there was something I could do but nobody likes a meddling cunt.  ""Hey man, I wasn't snooping or anything but you're kind of going through a lot of Bucky--""

""Oh hey, thanks for noticing, dude!  I'll just stop drinking right away!  I'm really glad you were counting the drinks in my bin, or else it would've never occurred to me I may have a problem!  I'm glad this is the first time we've properly spoken; great talk!  You should go around checking bins and give everyone one-man interventions!""

I just can't see that happening.  I imagine he'll either feel like shit, be mortified that I've noticed and it'll make things awkward as shit (and push him to hide his drinking), or he'll call me a busybody and tell me to get fucked.

i come from a long line of alcoholics and drug addicts, i have a pretty serious addictive personality. was terrified of alcohol for the first 15 years of my life but got drunk for the first time with a friend at 16 and it was bad from day one. there was no gradual progression, i began drinking hard liquor every day. i was able to keep it under wraps for a while (close to a year) because i spent so much time alone and out of sight but eventually my close friends and partner intervened and got my family seriously involved and i was able to get help and had a lot of support and started going to meetings and got back into therapy. 

i had been diagnosed with depression and two anxiety disorders as a kid but at 17 i was diagnosed with bipolar 1 along with some other issues. i had been about 3 months sober when covid hit and it was a blessing in disguise for me because i was able to take time away and focus on myself without the pressures of drinking at social events and without much access to alcohol. continued to use other drugs but not to any bad extent and i hadn’t drank again until this last week. 

now i’m legally an adult and as covid has been dissipating i’ve been very social and it was inevitable for alcohol to come up and of course it did. planned on having a drink at a friends birthday to test the waters but i ended up drinking a decent amount of vodka and falling asleep on her couch in front of everyone. and then a couple days later i went to a house party with lots of alcohol and planned on again having a drink or two but ended up passing out on the ground and i discovered later that i had blacked out at one point when i realized i didn’t remember certain parts of the night. thankfully my friends threw out my drink, helped me to the car and our DD helped drive me home and take care of me but i am incredibly embarrassed. 

i have been invited to another party with alcohol and part of me wants to just skip it but it is also my last opportunity to spend time with my friends before i leave for the summer and i don’t want to miss that opportunity to say goodbye. i know if i’m around alcohol i’m going to drink but part of me feels like maybe i can control it this time. is this just delusional or is it possible I don’t know what to do i feel very lost

I know that's not a proper way to deal with the loss. When I first started I was a little problematic cause I've never been drunk before. After all this time I've learned to control my behavior and recognize when I need to go off and be by myself till I'm ready to call it a day/night. I drink cheap vodka, 20-25 shots a day, sometimes more depending if I'm manic and stay up for long periods of time. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before I started drinking. They put me on meds that I never adjusted to and it created problems for me, which I won't get into cause this isn't the place for that. So I started drinking and while it feeds into my paranoia, I am aware of that and control it most times and drinking actually isn't a depressant for me like it is for most people. It's the only time I can express myself to others.

I don't create problems in my relationships with my drinking which confuses me because I think an alcoholic destroys their life with drinking. To me it's the opposite. It makes me want to live my life. When I don't drink, I don't wanna be here. I don't want to wake up. I don't want to face the world. It's kinda funny cause I heard someone call alcohol ""liquid courage"" and to me that's exactly what it is. I can't face people without it. I don't think I'm am alcoholic nor am I on a path of destruction. I believe alcohol can help some people. I wouldn't be here without it.

I was at work and my sister called me to tell me ""we need to talk"". Totally not ominous word there. So after some back and forth she finally admits that my drinking was stressing her out a lot (we lived together) and she didn't want to watch me destroy myself with alcohol.

My gut reaction was denial. But I do have a rational side. And that rational side said ""she's right, you drink way too much, you always crave alcohol and you're stressed out by the idea of being cut-off"". So at first, I thought maybe I could just reduce my consumption (I can't) or that maybe it wasn't problematic (it was).

So I decided to never drink alcohol again EVEN IF I HAVE A GOOD REASON TOO.

Because I knew in advance that my brain would make a lot of excuses and rationalizations as to why I could have a drink.

So in a fit of proactivity (and inspired by a rationalist Terminator fanfic, long story), I committed myself to never drink again.

If a reason presents itself, even if it is justified, I will stick to my commitment of not drinking.

Also it sucks. I crave alcohol every day. I even considered taking a swig of my after shave the other day. And I know I could go buy booze and no one will no except me.

And for that specific reason, past me made a commitment present me has to follow. Because past me knew what excuses I would make.

I finally found the motivation with support to actually try stopping instead of just knowing I should but not doing it. Withdrawals for 2 days, mostly shaking and sweating and feeling cold and hot,  but it's all over now. My appetite is back,  i finally cleaned my room and kitchen and started cooking again. It's nice. I am enjoying sobriety for now and I see how it's improving my life. Surprisingly,  I haven't craved alcohol that much and I've been taking my naltrexone. 

However,  maybe I will change my stance in the future, but I don't really feel like I want to give up alcohol for good. I'll stay sober for now, for as long as I can,  but I wonder if I can ever get back to the point before I started abusing alcohol. Back when I could just order a drink or two at dinner or just get drunk at a party,  have a hangover and not drink the rest of the week or until another big social event. Is that possible for most people or do they just completely relapse? I was drinking almost everyday,  usually alone at home and I'd kill a 1.75 L of vodka in 3 days like clockwork. Of course I don't want to go back to that,  but I still want to drink occasionally. 

I'm having trouble accepting the loss of not ever being able to drink again if it happens like that. I want to trust that I can just drink moderately and be okay and not binge. I won't know till I try I guess but I'm not gonna do it so soon and I know this mindset itself isn't great.

I have been addicted to pretty much everything else along the way. In 2008 I went to rehab 4 times for a total of 8.5 months. I was so desperate that AA actually worked for me even though I've been an atheist pretty much since the womb also. I went to Mexico twice for Ibogaine treatments, which did work for certain periods of time, like months. I finally got off of alcohol and all hard stuff for 12 years. Covid took me down again though. I was isolated, scared of the future, the whole nine yards. I had been drinking for over a year. Started with 2 oz of red wine.

I ended up bummed out and relapsed at a halfway house (meaning, of course, that I was made to leave). However, I proved to my family that I could at least make it a month without alcohol and ended up having everything else going for me - new job, new location, new friends that were staying sober, and a new - positive outlook on life itself. It’s nice to see what kind of potential you can have when you at least try to combat this debilitating disease.

I’ve been binge drinking every night at this time of writing, and am court ordered to do the six month stint. It’s definitely better than jail. I just don’t like that the only place that offers this kind of program in my area is the Salvation Army ARC. They isolate you during a 30 day intake period; no phone calls, no cell phones (which you can’t have anyway until you reach Level 5 in the program - five months later), you get the idea. They also force you to work 40 hours a week and give you $7 gratuity pay for the first week (eventually, you get $22), which is ridiculous. 

Plus, they don’t have actual counselors or do one on ones with recovering addicts. You basically attend Celebrate Recovery meetings and watch a lot of DVDs, while writing in journals and attending their chapel service every Sunday. Basically, you have to really pull yourself through your own recovery there and the CR groups are basically like AA meetings without the “Big Book” as a reference guide.

I know how the ARC operates, because I actually was there for 60 days and transferred to another facility because of bullying. 

I’m more upset with myself than anything when it comes to being back in rehab. I’ve actually relapsed three times within a six month period. You have to want to quit drinking, I know that. Disappointment or moments of depression and cynicism just drove me back to it.

They also tend to be avoidants who use sex and alcohol as an escape.

In the first few weeks, they seem emotionally available, their drinking seems absent or even normal

Eventually, the truth serum comes out. While on dates, they'll finally show their habit more, whether in front of me or talking about recent bouts with drinking. Some common phrases :

* I don't want you to think I'm always like this
*I don't like how drinking makes me feel. But then they tell me they just got blasted after seven drinks recently
*I was embarrassed for how much I drank

Now I'm a very light drinker. I might have a few drinks a year. And I get I'm not the norm. I don't put an expectation on someone that they can't drink. But I also have a history of women who would drink and also who would cheat.

I tend to meet women in the country bar dance scene. I'm a competitive dancer and while I like that it's an easy way to share an active hobby (I'm fit), I understand that it's a scene that has a risk of drinking. But some of these women go to my gym, shop at health grocers too where had we met there, drinking would still rear an ugly head.

Only when they bring up drinking do I ask questions in context. I've tried hard to not be accusatory, let it flow in conversation but also vet to make sure it's a healthy dynamic. Some of my follow up comments to their questions

Has drinking ever impacted your relationships

How often do you like to get drunk

Do you have any regrets with drinking

Who do you usually go out with and is it company you trust so that it's not a comprising situation

I also try to assure that I don't see anything wrong if someone let's loose once in awhile provided they're safe but I'm also concerned if someone is getting blasted all the time

Throughout the day all I could feel was a shaking sensation, constantly sweating, and the need to rest and not being able to. I was honestly afraid that if I went to sleep, I wouldn't wake up. My anxiety was through the roof. Luckily I called my best friend and she helped calm me down. I was able to finally sleep, and I feel a lot better. Still need some more rest, but at least I'm not freaking out. 

All of this has made me realize that what I've been doing lately, hasn't been helping me. The alcohol helps to makes the pain tolerable, and to make me feel at ease, but it's not healthy. And I'm hurting the people that care about me. So I've decided to stop drinking, for a while. Can I make it forever, I don't know. I think that I can manage to drink responsibly down the road, but I am nowhere near that point now. I just need to know then what to do going forward. Stopping completely, going cold turkey, sounds ideal but seems unrealistic. Plus I don't know how it'll make me feel physically. So would weaning work the best? Just drink in small amounts to eventually reach a stopping point. Any input, I'd greatly appreciate.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5765394}"

2021-06-21 15:32:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/o53dpp/wife_may_be_an_alcoholic/,Wife may be an alcoholic,"Where to start? I have been married to my wife for 3 years, together 4. Background, In the beginning it was all fun and hanging out and drinking for fun. Then we married and bought this house and moved in, she has 2 kids and her divorce was final about 6 months before we married. No I was not a cause of the divorce, it was in process when we got together.

Over the course of our marriage I have found that she has had a lot of trauma in her life, abusive, partying parents (possibly alcoholics?) Currently she is medicated for depression and anxiety. Recently I have come to think that she may be Borderline due to our rollercoaster marriage and a lot of her behaviors. She has always liked to drink as long as I have known her, and I have come to realize that it doesn't matter what she drinks, she cannot have just one or two drinks. If she was drinking wine she would get multiple bottles. If she was drinking some sort of malt beverage (mikes hard lemonade or something similar) she would make sure to get the higher 8% alcohol content version and get the large 24oz cans rather than normal sized ones. She always wants more, more is better until is isn't. I personally can drink one or two and stop, no issues for me. I can take or leave alcohol with no problem, can go days or weeks without a drink and never think about it.

She used to mostly drink wine, which strangely enough effects her personality the worst. After she has had a bottle or more of wine she can just flip a switch and there seems to be this rage that comes out. She also does this with other forms of alcohol but wine seems to have the worst effect. After some of her ""episodes"" as I call them she will remember nothing of the toxic things that come out of her mouth under the influence of alcohol. She also seems to drink more when her youngest son (14) comes to visit for the weekend, I have not really figured out why she drinks more when he is here but I have definitely seen a pattern emerging.

I do like to  have a drink once in a while, and my preferred drink is tequila with a mixer (OJ or cranberry or as a margarita). She was not a fan of tequila, but she recently started drinking my tequila mixed with diet coke just to have something to drink when something she likes better is not in the house. When she started drinking my tequila more that I do I figured out that she would drink things that don't even taste good just for the effect.

We have gone through periods when she asked me to lock up the alcohol in my gun safe so she didn't have access, we have had times when she swore off drinking and said she would be better off not drinking. A bad hangover will usually keep her from drinking for about a week where she will say she really shouldn't drink, but then something happens and she wants to self-medicate again. Due to her suspected Borderline, she gets VERY defensive and it can get really ugly. I am trying to figure out how to get her to work on the Borderline without her thinking that I think she is crazy, and on top of that I have no idea how to suggest to her that maybe she should not be drinking without her getting defensive about that either. It really is like walking a tightrope. If I say nothing she will drink and eventually get angry, If I tell her not to drink she will get angry and just go buy it herself.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45403937}"

It got to the point where she started sleep walking after drinking. She would throw up in random places in the apartment then refuse to go back to bed. She would get angry if I politely asked her to go to bed and would physically resist me trying to pick her up off the ground. One night she even fell off the bed and was trying to throw up but was on her back. Thank god I woke up and turned her on her side.  
I was always quick to forgive her, but maybe that was part of the problem. Although it did get better after junior year. Her sleep walking episodes are much rarer, but they occasionally happen. But now they’re much easier to deal with because now for some reason she listens to me, but she never remembers them happening.
Last night my girlfriend had the “Sunday blues” and went to the store to get stuff for dinner. She made kebabs and got a 6-pack. She took a sip and said she was disappointed because she thought she would have liked the flavor more. 
I went back to studying after dinner, and when I came back out at 10 to see if she was going to go to bed soon, I saw that glazed over look she always has when she’s drunk. I asked if she finished the entire 6-pack and she had. Which made me upset, because she didn’t even like the beer but for some reason drank the whole thing. We went to bed and like clock work, around midnight she slept walk to the living room. 
It doesn’t seem like that big of an issue but sometimes when she gets drunk she’ll get super emotional. If I’m sitting quietly watching TV she’ll accuse me of being mad at her. Or if I don’t want to cuddle she gets mad. Or she’ll randomly fight over something very small or something that happened weeks ago. Of course when she wakes up she either doesn’t remember fighting or she is apologetic about it.
I just don’t know what to do because I don’t want to see her go down this path but I feel like talking to her about it even when she’s sober is like navigating a minefield. She either blows it off or gets defensive. 

Does anyone have advice on how to proceed? I’ve never dealt with an alcoholic and none of our friends or family have seen her like this. So they wouldn’t be any help from an intervention standpoint.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5890181}"
2021-06-21 14:00:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/o51997/friend_struggling_with_alcohol_dependancy/,Friend struggling with alcohol dependancy,"Hi r/alcoholism! Thankfully I've never had alcohol problems myself, but I do have a friend which has been seeping into addiction for the past year or so, and I need some advice as to what I can even do for him, because I feel helpless at this point.

Let me start by giving an introduction to my friend. My friend has autism, I'm not sure where he falls on the scale, but basically he has social anxiety, and struggles to perform some tasks which others find to be easy (sweeping for example, he's practically incapable of, yet he can perform other tasks that are seemingly more complicated). Additionally, he's always been a stubborn person; which makes this so much more difficult for me.

A normal addict might not want help, but you can usually at least talk to them about it (or maybe at least people who aren't far gone). My friend on the other hand will often just stop talking to you if you say something he doesn't like (not even just with his overuse of drugs, politics is pretty much a no go for us, because any slight disagreement will turn into him being upset and ignoring everything I say). 

Often times he will send me videos where he chugs the last 1/4 of a small bottle of Amsterdam, and I usually do something along the lines of sending back a video of Mr. Lahey chugging a bottle (he knows trailer park boys very well, so I figured if I can have him realize that he really looks like Lahey, he might recognize how bad it is). And then he will just open what I said and close it. Even if I'm telling him he's drinking way to much, even if I tell him I want to help, no matter what I can't even start to have the conversation with him.

This all started when he had his first 'serious' relationship. To clarify that, they 'dated' for a couple weeks, and he fell in love immediately. I'm not sure if he's just prone to codependency, or if he truly found love in that girl, but he scared her off. He texted her constantly trying to hang out etc. etc. and eventually she ghosted him. Bit of a bitch move on her end, because she could've let him down a lot easier, but given the context it was understandable from an outside perspective (not that we tell him that directly, though we try to drop hints). This left him really depressed, he pretty much dropped off the map for a couple months, my only communication with him was just him sending me videos of him drinking white claws, or snapping bowls.

Since then it's only grown worse. At first he was drinking all day everyday, but less than he is now. Thankfully he either stopped drinking insanely early (like 8:00am), or he just stopped sending me videos of it, because I gave him shit every single time without fail. Not even in a rude way, I would put it the same way I talk to my girlfriend; so instead of saying ""you shouldn't drink early, it's unhealthy and unproductive"", I'd say ""yeah I mean I personally wouldn't be drinking so early just because if I drink early in the day I feel lazy for the rest of it (and so on)"". It wasn't until a week ago that he started sending me videos where he pounds the last quarter of a bottle, and since then I've been really worried.

He's at the point where his tolerance is way to high, or he's drinking himself into oblivion. I know alcohol tolerance is a relatively slow build, so I feel like he's more drinking himself into alcohol poisoning. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's anything wrong with the occasional beer, or even purposefully getting wasted (but only at a party or some special occasion), in fact I'd say most people would never know the difference if they had a single beer every night, but he's at a point that he can't keep doing this.

I know that's a lot so I'm really appreciative for anyone who managed to make it this far, and I appreciate any and all advice you guys can give me.

TLDR: Friend with autism's drinking is out of control. He won't talk to my friends or I about it at all, and the only thing which seems like it would even temporarily help him is a relationship, but if that failed he'd be worse off than ever. I feel helpless, yet I feel he will only spiral deeper into addiction if I fail to intervene. Any advice???",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58006734}"

Growing up was fine but as I entered my teenage years and dad and my mom would drink daily. They even allowed me to drink from age 15 as long as I did it in front of them. This ended up being my downfall with alcohol and I became dependent until I was 19 and moved far away from home.

My mom was always the referee and would tell my dad to stop drinking for the night because he was getting wasted.

My mom passed away 5 years ago. As she was in the midst of dying from cancer should would tell me that my dad was not taking care of her and that he would be drunk all the time. I spoke to him about this and he said he wasn't, just a couple drinks to help with the stress.

Immediately after my mom passed he started drinking whenever he was awake. I flew up to the funeral and he was completely wasted and could barely drive me home from the airport so I drove us back. He could not handle any of the funeral arrangements so family helped me sort everything out. 

Since then it was been a downward spiral. I have family, friends, his coworkers and his landlord calling me telling horror stories about my dad and how bad he has gotten. I don't want to go into details but they are extremely embarrassing. 

I live 3000 miles away, I have a toddler and a husband and a good paying job. I have no way of moving back home to take care of him and honestly if I did have a way I'm not sure I would want to go back because I feel like I would end up falling back into dependency along side him.

He has long stretches of sobriety, and then moments of time where there's lots of little lapses. He's never violent he's only very rarely passive aggressive, he's not a danger to myself or the kids.  It's more of an annoyance financially than anything else, but at least he likes the cheap shit.

I understand that recovery is a lifelong process and there will be moments in time where people are more successful than others. I can deal with the occasional drinking, I've made it very very clear that I cannot deal with the lying, and I don't want to catch him, or find liquor bottles hidden around the house. If he's struggling, talk to me about it and just be honest. Don't lie to me. 

My only very firm, clear boundary is that I don't want to have sex with him while he's drunk. It feels disingenuous and I don't like it. 

Last night I was out with a friend, and then my husband and I had sex when I came home. Turns out he was drunk. I didn't even realize, because he said he smoked some pot earlier. He didn't say anything about it. 

I saw some withdrawals in the bank account for cash yesterday and today. I asked about them, he said it was for alcohol. 

He didn't rape me. I initiated enthusiastically.  But still, come on dude! Why did he let me go through with that when he knew it was something I hated? 

I'm so sad I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave, but he's making it so hard to want to stay and part of me is thinking that maybe he wants me to go and this is his way to push me away.

I feel guilty for buying them alcohol in the past now. Should I intervene in any way or just let them be?

I feel pretty bad right now. A couple nights ago I hung out with 3 other friends in their apartment, but before that, I picked up some 40 proof amaretto from the package store after work. For context, I work in another town an hour away, but the town I live in is in a dry county. The nearest liquor store to us is 30 min away. I wasn't sure if the 3 would like it or not, but as it turns out, it's their favorite alcohol.

I wanted to be nice and let them drink as much of it as they wanted. I only had a peg of it, but they each drank about a third of it and finished off the 750mL bottle that night. After that, they each had 1-2 glasses of sweet wine and hard seltzers. I didn't drink any more that night.

After that night, I put two and two together and realized I've basically enabled their binge drinking. After spring classes ended, I've been hanging out with them almost every day and now I've gotten a feel of their drinking habits. I only started drinking with them just a month ago, about once a week, just to be social and have a good time but now I just feel awful that I've helped them get booze a few times.

I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/6q1RH8A3O3c) recently and that was enough to make me give up alcohol. They're decent people who are at the tail end of college and have a lot of potential, it hurts to see them drink. Two of them actually have alcoholism in their own families and are fully aware of it.

Should I even intervene at all? Definitely not gonna go out of my way to buy them alcohol again.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5982241}"

I stopped drinking cold turkey after drinking on and off for 8 years (I am 26 right now), with a daily consumption of 2 liters of beer/one fifth of liquor. Also, I was diagnosed with fatty liver stage 2 around one year ago. The first days of withdrawal were absolutely awful, but hey, at least I didn't have seizures so I was okay to put up with that for a short period of time (maybe one to two weeks). 
Now that I am in my third week of abstinence, not only the initial symptoms of withdrawal (insomnia, mood swings, memory lapses, confusion, sweaty palms, muscle pain) haven't subsided yet, but I am also having new symptoms (feeling more and more tired, abdominal pain and a bloated belly, headaches, and an ever increasing loss of appetite). 
 Since a lot of people said here on Reddit that after two weeks they started feeling better, I am worried that I might have done irreversible damage to my liver. I might've quitted to late, and maybe already have some kind of late stage liver illness that is not going to go aways on its own. 
I've quitted alcohol before, once for three months, but I've never had this symptoms. I worry that I might die, or at least have to be interned in a hospital, since I am feeling weaker by the day (I don't even have the energy get up my bed and microwave food anymore). To those that will advice me to see medical attention, I will, but I am now stranded in a foreign country for at least one more week and I am waiting to go back to my homeland.

Then slipped, had some off a 1 litre bottle and poured the rest away. Then 3 days sober but slipped again (6 beers and a pint of rum) and now again on third day dry. AA resonates with me and from an agnostic I've come around to believe in a force greater than me and have turned myself to that power. Im listing a few things I've done when drunk, because I have to get it off myself chest and also to come back to it to remind myself how much destruction my relationship with alcohol has caused. It maybe not be the worst but it is my experience and remembering back on those fills me with great pain and sorrow. Some of the things I learnt later from others because I was blackout drunk during some of these incidents. 

1. Called my mom (who I love beyond measure) awful names. 
2. Got into fights on the street with stangers. 
3. Fractured my little finger when I fell off my motorcycle drunk. 
4. Was too drunk the next few days to even know it was a fracture because I was anesthetized by booze. Now it's permanently crooked because it healed that way with no treatment. 
5. Took ""lunch breaks"" at work which was a sneak to a nearby bar for quart of rum hoping the mask will keep me unnoticed by any acquaintance. 
6. Terrible withdrawals after benders: tremors, sweating, night terrors, severe anxiety
7. Breaking things when drunk. Ripped off perfectly good clothing off myself when mad. 
8. Urinated in an ATM booth because I was so drunk and still getting cash out to continue
9. On meds for bipolar and still drinking. 
10. Lost sizeable amounts of cash. 
11. Woke up on afternoons on the street after a bender with the sun shining on my face
12. Cut myself
13. Burner myself with cigarettes
14. DUI on my motorcycle
15. Punched my uncle, who I love,  in the chest. Blackout drunk at the time. 
16. Embarassing times with my friends who were either sober or never as drunk as me. 
17. Drunken texts to people who I should have long let go. 
18. Spoken to my boss once while WFH and can tell he knew because of how slurred my speech
19. Romaing the streets in search of booze during the mini prohibition in my country as part of the lockdown. Nearly got myself beaten or robbed by the kind of folks I associated with. 
20. Vomitting, diarrhoea, headaches though I have long surpassed the normal ""hangovers"" that the occasional drinker gets. 
21. Absenteeism from work. 
22. Drinking away on my credit card and maxing it out when I was between jobs. 

And many more...The pain from putting these to words is also oddly comforting.

High School i was driven to be the “Class Partier” for the class superlatives. (I lost to the year book editor. How BS is that)I could out drink and out pass out everyone. Having sharpie on my face with dick pics was such a funny thing. I realize that i was unbelievably goofy for that time in my life. 
College made me think that i was finally able to live the MTV beach house lifestyle i had been always wanting. I drank a 30 pack of Natty ice every day, either in class (in my sippy cup) or in the dorms. If we ever went out to clubs it was Long Island ice teas and i would add my pocket vodka. I remember i would get so blasted that i would get behind the bar and make my self drinks until i would get drop kicked out of the bar. (They put my picture up at a bar to not let me back in)
I figured moving on to the real world would sober me up quick. HaHa. I got a job in Los Angeles where we would get hammered at lunch. And they would do coke. With the bosses who clearly had some issues and probably loved hanging out with younger dudes. I would black out for days at a time at work. 
But getting married, i would have to stop drinking a handle of vodka a night right? Nope, we attract our own. My wife loves drinking too. (Not as much as me but she can drink)
But having a kid would slow me down right? Nope, I’ll just get hammered and play legos. 
But having your kid tell a bunch of her friends that her dad is an alcoholic? Nope. “You kids never watched MTV beach house and don’t know what’s cool. Go back to tik toking you pip squeaks.”
I guess my point is, i just found those that had the similar issues as me and made it my world. I only would hang out with people that love to drink, it’s most people, it’s literally everyone that i socialize with. And then the pandemic happened. And i see through a different lens at myself. I was drinking a handle 1.75 liters of vodka or a bottle of tequila a day during lockdown. By myself. No food because that soaks it up. My wife cut way back and was starting to get pissed. But i would drink out of my sippy cup after i cut it with cranberry. I would drink in bed till i passed out and hide the bottles. Always by myself. Always just drinking to sleep and drinking to wake up and feel better. The pandemic put my life style in front of me as i realize that i really only have a few friends. I thought of myself as a social binge drinker, but that shit is a lie. I just make an idiot of myself. Just last night i waited till i put my kid down, and drank gin, straight up, no ice, like a fucking high class moron. I woke up shaking, with a hangover that I’ve had a thousand times. What the fuck? It’s not fun anymore. It’s not anything but a ritual that gets me nowhere. Besides depression and regret that I’m going to disappoint my kid, wife, family. What is it?
I’m sitting in bed reading all of your posts and it’s sad for the most part, but really inspiring too. You have been here and know things have to change even if they are incomprehensible. This is now the longest it’s been since I’ve had a drink since the beginning of lockdown in the US. 18 hours. I am only strong enough to not drink for 18 hours. But you guys are inspiring me.

My life is in shambles- no job, court for a dui next week, my boyfriend of 3 years just dumped me.  All of this shit fell apart because of alcohol.

Here's a lil slice of life.,"Hey alcoholics of reddit. I'm 27, have been an alcoholic since ~16 at at least 6 drinks a day, usually 12-25 units. I go back and forth between vodka and 4lokos. On and off periods of drinking all day, the only breaks have been the time I was hospitalized for a medically significant suicide attempt at 23 and the time I was hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal at 25. 

I have severe chronic MDD with psychotic features, and my episodes last years at a time. I use alcohol to improve my mood, relieve anxiety, and reduce auditory hallucinations. Its not that I'm not medicated for my condition; I just have tough nights sometimes despite my meds where I hear voices and while I've learned enough about my illness at this point to recognize them as hallucinations, I still find them incredibly distracting and distressing. Anyway, that's the by and large about why I drink. My current problem is much more pragmatic than all that.

I am currently drinking 4lokos since I don't have to walk all the way to the liquor store to get them, and I find it easier to not black out and do dumb shit that loses me friends or gets me arrested when I'm off of them vs vodka. But lately, I have been vomiting constantly. Waking up in the middle of the night to vomit, puking before my morning cigarette, puking on my morning walk to the gas station to buy my lokos, barfing after my first sip, and barfing as soon as I finish the can. Usually I can absorb enough alcohol to avoid withdrawal, but there have been more and more days lately where I enter withdrawal because I can't keep any alcohol in my stomach for long enough to absorb.

Anyway, herein lies my issue. I don't think I'm ready to go to long term rehab yet. I've done countless week long stays and IOP/PHP type programs, but they never inspire me to get sober for long. I literally just DO NOT want to quit drinking. I enjoy being drunk and it relieves unbearable distress that my mental illness causes me. There are so many concrete reasons I have for needing to change: it's getting harder and harder to hold down a job, I'm in thousands of dollars of debt from buying bottles and sometimes cocaine, I've lost almost all of my friends and family, and at 27 I am already suffering from elevated liver enzymes and high blood pressure.

Maybe this is not gonna be a useful post to make for me. You are probably gonna just tell me the same shit I've been hearing for nearly a decade now; change or die. I don't want to die. I promise I don't want to die. I feel so blessed to have had the moments of joy I've gotten to enjoy in my life. But I don't want to suffer either. Maybe this post will serve as a warning to any young alcoholics in this sub. It seems hard to rip that bandaid off now and change your life, but every day you keep digging that hole it's gonna get harder to do. Consider changing TODAY, before you start losing pieces of yourself you might not be able to ever get back.

The past 3 years, my alcohol issues got progressively worse. At one point, for months; I was drinking a 12pk of claws and I’d finish liquor bottles, staying up drinking till like 7-8am day after day.

I’m past that now, but I definitely think I did some brain damage. I have vision problems, bad memory issues, deteriorated comprehension skills, etc. I ~really~  damaged myself.

I’m not here as a sob story. I’m here to ask if anyone has the solution. Do I have to leave him? I’ve already cried and begged saying he’s killing himself and ruining our marriage.  I’m sober.

I’m confused and stuck between being a hopeful optimistic and tolerating an alcoholic spouse vs. having self respect, being a realist and leaving.

We’ve been in love and living together for 1.5 years. We reunited shortly after his marriage ended (due to drinking).

He refuses to seek help through rehab, and says he’s researching help only when my anger gets the best of me and I tell him to leave. I do love him, and he is amazing in every other way,  but the symptoms of this disease far outreach my tolerance to handle him when he’s drunk. Alongside my own anxiety/fear when he’s not drinking.

My nights are consumed in research, my anxiety peaks every time we are apart, in fear he will transition into this angry, messy, jealous person that I don’t recognize. Often, my fear comes true, and the cycle continues. He is on his way to a DUI, or losing his job. 

I’ve tried in the past year to save him. I’ve trained him to rely on me for his basic needs. It’s become codependency that I’m not comfortable with at all. He doesn’t have hobbies, and contributes little to the household or his own hygiene.

It would be easy to leave, as our relationship is new and not bound by marriage, financials or children. But a part of me feels guilt knowing I’m giving up on an amazing person with a sickness, and I know he is the love of my life.

I’m tired of the emotional abuse and want relief and peace more than anything. I’m loosing myself in the battle. I’ve begged him to leave before, but he doesn’t respect my needs or boundaries, sober or drunk. I know this is harassment, but he rationalizes his behaviour by saying he loves me and just wants to make this work. He wants me to stay and deal with his addiction and shitty decisions. 

What else can I do? I’ve tried ultimatums, forced rehab decisions that lead to broken commitments, tough love, support and understanding.  

Is there a solution? I’m terrified of the fact that alcoholism is a progressive disease and don’t want to be around if and when it progresses further. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? He’s not verbally or physically abusive, but is absent-minded and refuses to leave or change. He’s beyond emotional 90% of the time and professes his love for me continuously, which adds to the guilt I have when I’m angry about his drinking habits.

I didn't think I'd make it this far. But now that I'm going to be meeting up with friends that do drink in a couple weeks, I don't know if I can control myself.","For the past two and a half years, whenever I drank anything in the past it was seldom for enjoyment. If I was drinking I was going to get wasted. Even when I do tell myself to enjoy it, my urges get the better of me and I go over board. In the last six months before I got sober, I had been upping the ante with how much I could drink until I passed out and/or got sick to my stomach and spent the whole day regretting my life choices. 

I finally decided to sober up after I ended an almost year long relationship when the week following the break up resulted in a week long binge drinking. The first week was hard as my urges tried to get the better of me. I really thought it wasn't going to last a month let alone a week, but as of today, I have not had one thought of coming home from work and thinking that I needed a drink. I had even gotten back into old hobbies and routines that I've neglected since I had replaced them all with alcohol. 

But now that things are slowing getting back to normal and I and my friend have all been vaccinated, I can finally get to see them. However, I know that all of my friends do drink, and while I'm okay with that and they know that I've been sober so they won't pressure me, what I am worried about is my inner voice telling me that I'm missing out. I know there are some alcoholic beverages that I legitimately like to enjoy, but I'm afraid one sip might have me relapse. 

I'm in this tug of war with myself on whether I want a healthier relationship with alcohol or stay on the wagon. Since the last two years I was only ever really drinking on my own and there were only a few occasions where I sat down and had a cold one with da bois. Do I want to make the exception to only drink with other people around since I can control myself better or will it be another excuse to keep me tied down with this disease? 

Right now, I don't miss alcohol or have the constant cravings like I used to have, but I do miss the social aspect of drinking. I just don't know where to go with it from here. A little advice on this would help a lot.

Edit: Hey all, thank you so much for the support! I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while to get some kind of encouragement to stop drinking. I'm really grateful to have this much support coming from all of you! I've tried so many times to stop in the past but I kept finding other excuses to continue this bad behavior. I don't know how this time I'm actually making this much progress, but all of your replies make me want to keep going. Thanks again for the help and I'm proud of everyone one of you that's been sober or trying to get sober!",61,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4833981}"

After my parents separated she quit for 6 years out of spite to my dad because he tried to talk to her about it. She started drinking again when I was 17. Since then she started at a bottle a day (8 standards in Aus) to 2 bottles over the last 3ish years to now half bottles of gin as well as wine since Jan when my grandfather/ her father passed away. 

She has said quite frequently over the last few years “I just want to drink myself into oblivion.” And “I don’t care if I don’t wake up tomorrow.” And it’s getting to the point where a lot of her life is getting seriously neglected. Including pets (5), house, finances and her health. My sister also seems scared of her.

My older brother and I have been talking on and off since March to talk to her. But, he just ditched cause he says she doesn’t seem too bad and he doesn’t want the conflict. 

How should I approach this conversation? I don’t want her to feel ashamed or embarrassed, or feel like I hate her when I don’t. But I’m afraid not struggling with this addiction personally there may be a few things I could/would say that I don’t know aren’t constructive? I know that right now she is in denial and there is a possibility that she won’t accept that she’s an alcoholic. But letting her ‘drink herself into oblivion’ is something that I can’t do anymore.

What would you do with that.,"Hi all. [I posted this two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/noaei3/i_feel_like_my_brother_is_an_alcoholic_he_doesnt/). He said he agreed it went poorly (we didn't assign blame) and he doesn't remember parts of it.

Complicated but great news since, and another request for advice! Sorry, another essay.

For the two weeks after my post, I basically stopped interacting with him in any meaningful way because I couldn't really look at him, and I stopped drinking at all in the house. And not much outside either, but MAN it feels like everyone is just ramming it down your throat, and I am not even trying to quit. It's not just you, quitting people! They get like, offended, and crap, like you drinking water is about them. It's really obnoxious!

Anyway, he went down south to see a friend, and my mom and I followed a few days later to meet for some family events, but not before making the decision to move all the alcohol into my room. And it's a LOT. I have a full personal bar and am in a wine club (he owns maybe one or two of the bottles and even that is arguable since they are replacing mine). I'm now semi-literally knee-deep in alcohol that I barely want anymore. I've had to do this before with a roommate, and I have to say, I am really f\*\*\*ing sick of this sh\*\*.

I thought it was perhaps too aggressive a move, and it was a given that he'd blow his top, but mom said it wasn't confiscating, and we'd still let him access it, but he had to have me give it to him. And it was more of a ""let's try this"" and if he really flipped out, we could try something else. And it was easier to do it first and make him actively refuse than to suggest it up front. I was persuaded.

We met up with him down south, and he very clearly tied his drinking to mine without saying so the whole weekend, which meant he basically didn't drink (last event was a birthday where I finally agreed to a drink after saying no—literally—5+ times). It was nice. I had my brother back.

I knew he rightfully wanted credit for being a good boy, and that this would make it sting even more when he saw the empty alc cabinet, and that is what happened. Although the fact that he was sober made the ensuing conv much more bearable.

He said 1) he felt untrusted and cut out but perhaps that is fair, 2) that it would make things worse because he was always gonna be around people drinking and had to learn to deal, 3) that he'd see less of me if I drank in my room, and 4) that it made him want to go out and buy his own liquor cabinet. I said, respectively, 1) yeah kinda but it's more that I don't want to contribute to it, and you said I can't control you so same goes, and talking to you didn't work, 2) out of sight out of mind is the bigger impact, 3) no, I've barely been drinking at all, and 4) I was very firm that I would accept ZERO blame ever for him buying more alcohol but please don't.

He also said he had talked to his friend down south who had struggled with addiction, and had come up with some plans that now felt useless because we deployed ours. **And here is the part I need advice about**: He said his plan was to give me 100% control over his alcohol intake. He will never ask. I will just choose to offer or not offer. I told him I don't know why that seems useless now when that is actually a higher bar than my mom and I had set, and I'm happy to do that, and we agreed I would.

The thing is, I feel like he certainly should not drink until he is no longer depressed—at all, because it is bad for your mental health even if you aren't addicted—and quite possibly shouldn't even drink after that. I am not sure he realizes what he agreed to in this respect. Him giving me this power is also like a quantum leap ahead of our last conv that I never thought possible, and I really want to reward that by meeting him halfway, but my feelings about how to use this power are not halfway feelings. There's also obv the thought that he will relapse if I'm stricter than he bargained for. I'm not sure he will—he seemed very sincere and hurt about how our relationship had spiraled, and that kind of hurt tends to yield follow-through on his part. But I've seen too many new sides of him lately so iono.

**What would you do with something like this in my position?**

I told him above all, his feelings of hurt make sense and are fair, and I'm always happy to hear them, and I do have a feeling there are gonna be a lot more of them before we get through this. And I told him he did a really good job this weekend, and it was nice having my brother back. He ended the conv with a joke, and we are doing a lot better interpersonally now.

As always, be thoughtful, he might read this. I am not guarded about my Reddit so he may even be reading them already for all I know. I consider it spying to comb the Reddit of someone you know beyond what they've sent you, given that they are posting anonymously even if publicly, but it's not a boundary I've ever verbalized so who knows, and I don't think I mind in this case anyway. Whole nother conv. Thanks for reading.

Long story short we partied since we were young.. by the time we were 16-18 we were drinking and driving like it was normal and it was a horrible situation.  I was on cocaine frequently and binge drinking with the rest of my friends while we built drift cars and would be doing some crazy things. One night we had just another shop party just another regular night when i invited a friend of mine over to have some drinks. He was supposed to meet my other friends at the bar for midnight so he left at 1130 in his truck and didnt think anything of it. An hour later we ran out of coke went to go grab another bag and we seen cops and a big scene not far from the shop. I remember driving by and wondering what happened as it looked pretty bad, Turns out it was our friend who didnt make it home that night.. Single vehicle truck accident killed him instantly and we drove by the scene and had no idea it was him. The guilt i had at first for inviting him out was unbearable, he was an awesome young man who had many many friends and everyone knew him. This happened 5 years ago almost to the day and that was the start of my transition. I keep in touch with his brother and his mother and that helped me alot. I am no longer in the dark place i was but it seemed to take something horrific to happen in order to put things in perspective with me. My friends dad who owned this shop always told me i was playing Russian roulette everynight when we would do what we do. If anyone out there reading this is living recklessly like this please take this story into consideration it may save a friends life, or even yours.

\-is DPDR all about anxiety/trauma or I might have damaged my brain somehow ?

I’m deciding to write my story here because I wanted to try a different approach since what I have been trying to do isn’t helping my situation at all. So whoever takes the time to read my story and whoever replies to it, I want to thank you in advance. A lot of self realization going on lately and I’m trying to figure out how to accept it, learn from it and move on with my life. 

Here is a little background for you. Growing up my father spent most of his time drinking when he wasn’t working and alcoholism runs in my family on both sides. My mom has never had a real problem with any substances although she did have a a little bender with alcohol but it was very short lived. I first got drunk when I was 14 and throughout my teen years I was very up and down with my alcohol consumption but never thought it to be a problem in my life nor thought it would become one. Once I hit college, that’s when I started partying harder, adding liquor into the mix and smoking marijuana regularly. Coupled with long nights of drowning yourself in alcohol comes the bad decisions, guilt, embarrassment, and regrets. I got a dwi after I turned 21 and have messed up not only my own car, but my mothers as well. I’ve lost friendships and boyfriends because of my addiction and have let alcohol come in between me and my animal technician career. Within the last 4 years my alcohol consumption has reached new levels and it has become more frequent in my life. My dad passed away in 2017 and ever since I have struggled to find happiness within myself.  I also moved away from my hometown in 2018 so I had a lot of readjusting to do that led to making new friends and hanging out in bars. I tried substances I never thought I would in my lifetime, which, in my opinion, has led my alcohol addiction to become more of a staple in my life over the past few years.
 
I am currently 32 years old on my way to 33, I have been in a relationship for a little over a year now, live with my mother still (for specific reasons), and am only working part time currently due to a foot injury. My relationships with my mother and partner are failing because of my habits with alcohol. Within the last year I have been back and forth with my alcohol consumption and even though I’ve slowed down a lot compared to the last couple of years, I still struggle to beat my urges to drink and my overconsumption once I start. I’ve woken up sick more often in the last 7 months than I ever have and I hate the emotions that come with the addiction. I already suffer from depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder and know that alcohol only makes these conditions worse. My mom told me I am just like my father and my boyfriend has had a history of dealing with alcoholics and has battled it himself. I know he wants the best for me but it’s hard for him to deal with my negativity and moods and also the fact that I say I want better for myself but I just end up making things worse. He says he wants me to be me and don’t change what I don’t want to change just for him but this is something I’ve wanted to detach myself from for a long time now. 

I have a hard time fighting urges to want to drink because I love the feeling. My problem is once I start I have a hard time stopping. I become someone else when I’m drunk, like a careless invincible person who just wants to have fun and won’t let anyone stop her. I’ve trained myself to include alcohol in a lot of social settings, like going to the beach or going to watch my friend play music or just going out to eat! I’m also having a hard time accepting that this is the way I’ve been living my life for a long time and where I could be mentally, physically and emotionally if I didn’t allow myself to let alcohol become a staple in my life.

1) regardless of what i do, everyone in meatspace will hate and abuse me.  The only people who care are anonymous strangers in a text box.  So stop even trying to leave the room.  Accept that there's nothing positive out there, and cherish this time alone.  I figure i have 'till covid ends before being unhoused.  Already have my library and tent packed.  Just hoping i'm given a few minutes to grab valuables and weapons before launching my next stage, homeless.

2) despite coming with some pretty impressive potential included with the packaging, managing the nightmarish cacophany of trauma responses and unmet emotional needs that is my limbic brain takes far more energy than i can muster.  I'm accepting that little things like bathing, chores, and earning will forever be beyond me.  This one is frustrating because there are so many potential paths out: validation, emotional support, therapy, medication-that it's hard to simply accept that i'll never have access to any.  But, i'm almost fifty.  If i could find a way to make that shit work, i would have by now.  Stop trying.

3) i'm just not a suicide.  Not in my composition.  And...like, the kind of crazy, perpetual adrenaline dump that my trauma gave me causes me to be totally fearless and incredibly adept at emergencies.  I can't even accidentally die from doing absurdly reckless, life-threatening shit.  At worst, i just pick up a few more scars and another body part never works again.  Accept that i have to ride this coaster to the end.

4) It's just really dark in my world.  I didn't just peer into the abyss, i dropped in and built a bone cabin there.  I'd love to report back about the view, but see (2) above.  If i can only muster a bath maybe five times a year, and can grab 20-25 hours sleep a week at best, writing a book just ain't goan happen.  Accept that i'll never accomplish anything productive, as well.

So.  I'm mostly just bitching.  I know even electrons in a text box have nothing to offer here.  I'm too far outside the range of personality traits expressed by the common sapient monkey to be able to get advice on this stuff even from people sincerely trying.

I'm on the verge of losing my job on Tuesday - I've been called in for a disciplinary for 'gross misconduct' because I freaked out one to many times and ran away (even though I came back, but that's neither here nor there).

I have no idea why I'm telling this to strangers on the internet. I despise people. I have bad history with people; I've tried to make friends but it ends up back-firing in my face.

This is my third ever job, and it's been the longest, although I have just fallen short of a year by a few days. I wanted to settle and belong, but I can't and I've realised that I'm not capable, long-term. And it's a shame because I'm really good at my job. I pick up things really quickly and I'm good that way - I can pick up things in a couple of months that others have spent decades of their lives and careers learning.

But I always ruin everything. I lack social skills, sure; but mostly I am an alcoholic. I'm writing this while drunk (otherwise I'd never have the courage).

Alcoholism, various mental disorders and cancer all run in all sides of my family (it would be quicker to list the things that aren't wrong). I never stood a chance, I guess. But I'm not blaming anyone but myself. I have a knack for digging myself into even deeper holes. Seriously.

I knew that I was a boy ever since I had memory (around the age of 4). The friends I had a kid were my neighbours and brothers, and I legit thought (especially when they pointed out my lack of a certain lower appendage) that I'd either been naughty enough that my parents had cut it off; or mostly I felt cursed. My whole life I've always been different and wished that I were normal. I wanted to wake up normal, or not at all.

My first experience with alcohol was being scared in my room while listening to my Mum being drunk, and her falling over. My Dad worked long hours, and I didn't see much of him as I went to school before he had his breakfast and I was already in bed when he came home. My Mum suffered with all that. I used to be so terrified of her because I didn't know how to deal with her; when she was drunk, she was like an alien. I was terrified. So when I was 16/17, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about - but, more so; I wanted to be strong enough to deal with her. When I was drunk, on her level; I wasn't afraid of her anymore.

And now I can't function (not that I ever really did). I had A Levels (just about since my Mum dragged me to exams when I was too freaked-out to attend school); I tried Uni and then dropped-out. My parent's marriage fell apart. And I blame myself for all of it.

Now they've been separated for nearly 12 years. My Mum moved on, but my Dad never did because I've learned that he's more like me. Walked out of his job because he freaked out. The only person on the planet that could read his handwriting was his secretary. But the difference between him and me is that I'm an alcoholic and he barely drinks. I've lost my 20s to being hungover and full of anxiety, guilt and regret. I don't want my 30s to be the same, but I know that I have a multitude of illnesses. And I'm about to lose the one job I had where I thought I might have a shot of belonging (but screwed it up).

I feel a bit better (I think) for getting this all down, just in case.

In the last 3 months, i drunkenly quit a high paying kitchen gig, wrecked my car, lost the same vehicle while drunk.
Fell asleep at a gas station, and all kinds of other stupid shit.

And the worst part is I lied so frequently. I’m usually an extremely honest person but poison does that. And now, she might not ever trust me again.

As soon as i turned 13/14 i was drinking, smoking doing drugs, living life to the fullest as some might say. My friends and i have been friends since we were just little kids. We are an awesome group of fun people, in highschool we didnt miss a party, we drank, we did drugs, we blacked out, we did very stupid things. Got a little bit older to the end of highschool/ few years out, Cocaine became the normal in my city, became the normal in the drinking scene. Found myself in a bad situation long story short after a few years of constant drinking and doing blow (cocaine). I wanted to sober up, i wanted a family, i wanted a girlfriend. I ended up meeting the love of my life and we have been together for 4.5 years now and since then i have completely changed my ways. My group of friends some have girlfriends that get along well with my gf things were good, but fast forward a bit i am 24 bought my first home wanting to start a family, and this close friend group i have been intertwined with for 15 years all they do is get blacked out everytime they drink and still on the bags pretty good. When i first got sober i HAD to isolate myself, there is no way you can go out hang with that crowd and expect not to drink or do those drugs eventually you will give in. Now i dont want to isolate, theres things i want to do in life i feel like i wasted 8 years partying, doing drugs binge drinking. Everything we do or have done in the past 4 years has ended up in the same spot, at the same garage or persons house blacked out drunk just wanting to do an 8ball. These are my brothers i have grown up with i want the best for them but this shit is to toxic for me idk what to do.   There is much more to this but to sum it up thats basically it. Makes me feel lost as you look around nobody in there mid 20s wants to get there shit together where i am from, nobody has responsibilities and im just different.

This has only increased during the pandemic as I've spent a majority of the past 15 months stuck inside. I'm high risk and so are the people I live with, so I stay in and away from people as much as possible. 

The events of 2020 made me realize how bad my drinking had gotten and while I've made some improvements since this revelation, I still have my struggles and roadblocks. 

Starting in April 2021, I have been reaching 10+ dry days a month, something that hasn't occurred since late summer 2020. Since April 1st, I've had 26 dry days. In this time I haven't had over 156 beers and haven't consumed nearly 25,000 calories. I definitely feel the physical, mental and emotional changes. Even on my worst days, I remind myself to be kind to myself and don't get lost in negative thoughts. 

I recently had my summer plans changed due to an injury and I feel that has been a trigger for me as it has lead to a constant state of boredom. I only have 4 dry days this month so far but I also have plenty of time to reach 10+ days by the end of the month.

I came across this article when I was googling potential remedies for alcoholism. I had some immediate thoughts to share about it.

Statistically, not many of us can stay sober and that’s just a fact. I have been trying for 3 years now, my longest stretch of sobriety being 6 months and boy do I wish I could have that back. From my experience it comes down to working the steps and going to meetings, but it doesn’t hurt to include other things such as exercise… or baclofen.

I have been on this med baclofen since January (for back pain) and it has really helped with my cravings. It took me a while to put the pieces together, but when I came across this article I was stunned.

I just got my refill today, I’ve been off it for a couple weeks now, but I’m excited to get back on it tomorrow. I’ve been on relapse row lately and enough is enough. If anyone has a similar experience, feel free to share!

When we first started dating about 4 years ago, my boyfriend had a bad drinking habit. He'd get tipsy or drunk every night and was missing a lot of work because of it. I was very vocal about my displeasure for this. He eventually sobered up and we moved in together and decided we wouldn't keep alcohol in the house due to temptation. 

He eventually began to introduce alcohol again but only 1 pint of beer every couple of months. He slowly began to drink a little bit more but it never seemed like a concern. Now, he'll buy a 12 pack and down 4-5 cans in one night or buy a 2L bottle of cider and finish the whole thing by himself within 2 days if not less. 

I haven't voiced my displeasure as to be honest, I feel guilty when I did. He'd end up crying and apologizing profusely. I'm just worried now that because I haven't been putting my foot down, he's slipping.

I was a very heavy drinker from 23-30. And only got worse and worse over time. My father was a abusive raging alcoholic and I thought I was smarter and better than him and wouldn't ever get there until my wife started pointing out all the similarities I was showing. And how I really was an alcoholic and heading down the same path my father had and I need to stop before I really fucked things up. 

With her help and my friends I've been able to stay sober for 23 months now. The pandemic helped a lot where I was homebound with my wife who doesn't drink either, but now that things are more or less returned to normal, the usual pressures are getting to me and stressing me out. I almost had a slip up last night and it really put into perspective even tho I've gone this far, I still have a lot to work on myself. 
With my work schedule being very demanding and very varied hours, I don't have the ability to go to regular meetings, and I'm not one for public sharing in that kind of setting. And am not religious so the thought of aa kinda seems off putting. 

So I'm more or less wondering if anyone has a good resources for me to kind of have a sounding board for when I'm feeling weak. Or struggling because I've never had a ""sponsor"" or anything nor have I had really any one I know close to me be in recovery as well. Any out reach and help would be appreciated.

I'm 27 years old and for as long as I can remember, my father has always been an alcoholic. He is the kind of ""high functioning"" alcoholic, at least he used to, nowadays not so much. The problem is he won't admit he drinks too much, he gets too mad when we mention it, he refuses to get help and says we exaggerate, then he spends like 1 week sober or sometimes even a month, drinking very little or even nothing... but then one day it begins again. He gets home drunk, eats very little all day, rides his motorcycle - probably drunk, we don't know what happens - get home and sometimes throw up. He is a very stubborn, annoying drunk. And it is making him become a """"""worse"""""" person when he is sober. He is more bitter, more distant, more confused with life overall.

That said, I don't live with him. My parents are divorced, I live(d) with my mother but now am moving to another state. My father has remarried, but his new wife doesn't know what to do either, and contacts me for help. 

We don't know what to do to even begin to address the issue. Would appreciate ANY help and advice.

How's it going reddit, hope all is good. 

So, another one. This might be abit all over the place, for which I'm sorry, writing this from a bad place right now and finding it hard to focus. *Edit - Yeah its deffo all over the place as I read it back lol quite hard to make sense out of what I'm trying to say*

I can't seem to stop drinking even againts my will I keep finding my self drunk, I don't drink everyday due to the hangover in between, but usually about 3 times a week I would say. I have never really been a good drinker and even stopped for a couple years, but over the last year or so I just haven't been able to control it, and just about having enough now.

I lie to myself and say ill have 1 drink, no matter how many times I tell my self I am not going to do it again, I hate myself for it and just how bad of an issue it is for me, I just always go back for another bottle of whiskey I usually drink around 70-100CL of JD Fire from the bottle. I have drunk with other alcohols but the result is no different, wether its Beer, Rum,  Wine, Vodka or anything, it will happen, and I can't stop myself. My belly goes over alot when I'm sober because I know I'm gonna find a bottle of whiskey before the days out and even with everything I tell my self, I still do it. I have tackled this by mixing cocaine and found it was the only thing I could drink with and stay a sane and nice person but ofcourse that itself began to open a world of problems which I am so grateful and lucky to have the control over. I still do it here and there but try not too as I get used too it very quickly and begin thinking i cannot drink without it and use it every other day and will in turn drink until I can't no more resulting in around 2x 70cl bottles of whiskey being drunk, ill end up causing some real liver damage. I am by no means a big guy either, 5'8 and weigh 9 stone. 

My main concern is every other day I will get blackout drunk and turn very hateful, angry and spiteful. Never remembering any of this, very rarely some vivd slight memories come back, I usually remember of the intent I had in causing my self any problem/harm, its hard to explain, like I can't remember the actions but I have some sort of reasoning in my head that won't make any sense too me. Very hard for me to explain that part and I hope someone would understand me from that vague and shite explanation.

I could be drinking, everything going good and well, time skips a few hours and in my mind it had been a few seconds, I could of been in the middle of anything like getting something from the cupboard and I will black out, go on a complete rampage intentionally smashing things I need and want, causing huge arguments and sometimes fights, i try and hurt myself(Usually have big lumps on the back and side of my head)Few cuts and even forced a couple boxes of strong tablets down my neck and I don't know why. I begin unloading on anyone who says anything to me, and just act like a general prick, only to come back around and go fetch the item from the cupboard and see the damage i have caused and try begin speaking with everyone as if it never happened because i legit don't know what i had done, which usually doesn't go well. This is also something that happens usually when I come home, I can be out drinking, I come in say hello to everyone and a hour later I am off on one lasting between 20 minutes or all the way till I have woken up, literally get out of bed blackout drunk and go insane(Usually the worst ones), Waking up in the morning with broken glass all over my bed and cut myself from sleeping on it and not knowing what the hell is going on, the last memory I had is laughing with a friend or walking home with something too eat for when I get in or just coming in and greeting everyone if it ain't too late and then boom I am in the middle of the street or inside my bedroom going bat shit crazy and boom im back at the table with my food ready to eat with my family going crazy at me. I have been kicked out a few times for it and I will be under fire from the family, it is never confined to my home either everyone will be told about my latest episode and I get phone calls from more family to remind me how much of a stupid cunt I am which causes me so much more stress. Things don't usually lighten up at home either so what do I do? Drink some more and not even to try and make self feel better from it, I just end up drinking again and I don't really know why. I would have said to my self 20 times already I wouldn't drink. I smoke weed too but it just doesn't hit the spot, it used to and I didn't drink for years but a few things lead to another and I picked up drinking again. 

I don't know where it comes from. My family have had about enough of me, I know its me in the flesh causing these problems but I sincerely, truly dont know or remember any of it, I have never seen my self this way.

I just need some help and advice from people who might have been in the same position, I am getting very down from all this and it kills me more to know its just not who I am, I am not that person, I got a lot of love to give but when I drink it switches into anger. I can't keep doing it to myself, I have more then pushed away people who I needed in my life. They are gone now but if for the last bit left of me I can try and identify what is happening, why can't I stop drinking or why can't I stop turning into this violent freak I can possibly make a change worth fighting for. I believe have faced my demons and I don't know what else I could do, I believe I am at peace with them. Maybe not😑. I would think maybe there is a underlying condition but its so heavily affected from the alcohol, I think I'm just caught in a bad cycle right now. I aint too sure.

Everyone bought me bottles for every occasion, my husband picked bottles up on the way home from work. I was nicer, more fun, did silly things with the kids, more loving towards my husband. For years! 
I started drinking earlier and earlier everyday, I figured I could be fun all day … Switched to Vodka and Captain through the day bc I could sneak shots easier than chugging a glass of wine. I would fill them up or replace them to hide how much I was drinking. My husband thought the bottles remained untouched. 
So over the past year, Ive basically checked out. I don’t remember alot, started blacking out a couple times a week. Still managed to get kids ready for school, and fed healthy meals and I do not believe they realized. But started drinking with my morning coffee to take away the hangover. Doordash and grocery delivery got too much of my money! Every soccer game was a party!
Anyways, I think people are starting to notice, little comments about how “fun” I am from moms at school and neighbors.. I don’t want to be known as that person, and I know it is really killing my body. 20lb weight gain, I don’t get my hair done or do myself up anymore, too drunk to care what I look like..
So, it is Friday, the last time I drank was ALL day Monday, blackout at 9pm. I have not went more than a day without in a very long time. 
I’m having extreme emotional ups and downs, and night sweats but it is still better than being hungover, or not remembering the day before!

My dad has been an alcoholic all of my life (and nearly all of his). He's high functioning, but he got particularly drunk tonight, and was really struggling not to slur his words. He had his first drink at 11am this morning.

I'm very concerned as to what the long-term effects of this is. He's so clever and lovely, even when he's tipsy, but I've read that long term alcohol abuse, even in high-functioning alcoholics, can cause some serious brain damage. I just read about a woman who was the carer for her father as his brain had deteriorated from the constant drinking. 

I'm going to be honest: I'm 16, but my dad is in his 50s, and he's been drinking since he was 13. How do I help him? Even if it just helps him put one glass down, how do I do it? I really feel like even organ failure wouldn't be enough to stop him. His blood pressure has been so high recently that his head is constantly 3 shades redder than the rest of his body. I'm so scared.

He started twitching in his sleep the other night (it looked like he was suffocating) and after I woke him up, I jokingly told him that I thought he was finally going to kick the bucket and laughed - but it was only a half joke. I'm terrified that something really might go horribly wrong one of these days. 

I just... I can't lose my dad. In any sense. I can't watch him kill himself, I can't watch him slowly go mad, I can't... Please help me.

I made it to the one week mark! I couldn’t be more proud of myself. This is the longest I’ve been sober for more than a year. Honestly yesterday and the day before were probably the hardest days. My typical routine was to get off of work at 9 or 11 pm and drive to the convenience store, buy a six pack, drive home, drink the whole thing, and then either pass out or drive down and get another six pack. It was kind of daunting knowing that I wasn’t going to buy beer, and the absolute cravings were awful and anxiety inducing. Today would have been another day of drinking to keep the hangover at bay, most likely a 12 pack at least. Same thing would have occurred tomorrow.

I was able to hold out though! It was tough, but I joined in on one of the 24/7 AA meetings and that kept me going. Yesterday morning I was kind of in the dumps, but not hungover which felt great! I’ve gotten back into coffee, which I stopped drinking altogether about 8 months ago due to it making the shakes, anxiety, and sweating worse. I used that extra energy to clean my apartment up for the most part, which it looks a hell of a lot better. My kitchen is now functional again, and I cooked a nutritious meal which I haven’t done in months. 

I’ll tell you, I feel great! I don’t plan on ever drinking again. I even played one of my favorite video games for a few hours last night. Haven’t done that in ages it seems. 

I will say though, the sleep thing is still a problem. I went to bed around 2 am and woke up around 6, back to bed at 7 and woke up at 9. I know it’s going to take some time for it to get better. But I will say this is one of the few times I’ve been truly sober where I wasn’t having vivid nightmares that would wake me up screaming. I actually had some pleasant dreams last night.

I’m also proud to say that I will be showing up to work this evening without a hangover and the shakes, unless it’s from my caffeine consumption, which I plan to space out over the day.

I met my boyfriend in not exactly the right place considering what I'm discussing about right now - a pub. I met him when I was having a quiet drink with one of my friends and he was playing pool with his friend. We got talking about the music that was playing then my friend and I played pool against his friend and him and then we exchanged numbers, went on a few dates and then became officially together. Fast forward a couple of months and I moved in with him.

On the first few dates, we went to the cinema, a restuarant and a few pubs. All but one time he had a drink, but he wasn't drinking excessively so I didn't think anything about it. He works a lot of hours during the week and earns a fortune so we have always gone out on a weekend. During the pandemic we have stayed in and watched a film, bought a takeaway and had a few drinks. It's all fine in the sense that he doesn't get mortal or aggressive, but I still think he drinks too much. 

I found bottles of whisky, wine and other alcoholic drinks under the bed, down the sides of the sofas, in the cupboards, etc. I mentioned the ones I found next to the sofa and he dismissed my concern by saying they were from when we had a drink on the weekend, but I knew that was false because I cleaned up the house regularly. 

The pub where we met is where my friend worked (at the moment the pub is closed) and she told me that before he met me he was in the pub every night and would always drink at least 10 pints. 10 pints????????????? My father never even used to drink that much in one go and he liked a good drink!!! Even when we go out he always drinks about 3 pints to my 1 pint. 

I don't think he just drinks on the weekend, I suspect that he has a drink before I come in from work at about 8pm. I feel like I'm supervising him at times, but I have found cans and bottles in the bin in the past.

So during the pandemic, I definitely drank more than usual. I used to be a social drinker, but for the past year (except 2 months when I was sober) I’ve drunken a fair amount. I used to have a few days sober every week, but for whatever reason for the past month I’ve had none. 

Usually I drink 5ish standard drinks but I’ve found every few days that’ll spike to 8-15 for a day. 

The lack of social activity is definitely a big cause. Either way, it’s been a bit scary. 2 weeks ago after a big binge I tried going sober and had bad heart palpitations. Having a drink stopped them right away. 

No hand tremors, sweating, or racing pulse. My pulse was less than 90 when it happened, so definitely more than usual (I’m in pretty solid shape), but anxiety was also a factor. 

I’ve definitely cut back since then, and I want to get back to when I was a social drinker. I realize that may take a LONG time, given what I’ve gotten myself into, but I was wondering if anyone could spare some advice as to what withdrawal would be like for me. 

By cutting back I mean on most days I’ll have 4-5 drinks with an occasional spike of 8-15 about twice a week. There used to be a lot of 6-8 drink days but they’ve gone back to 4-5. 

At what point is it serious and I should go to the ER? I realize I’m probably not a candidate for DTs, but I do feel like I’m beginning to have a physical addiction. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Approaching the 24 hour mark will be the real test, but it's reassuring that I haven't had anything yet. Definitely keeping a close eye on things.

About 24 hours have gone by. No real withdrawal symptoms. Really happy about this, but will keep monitoring overnight and the next few days.

Years ago I was sick (common cold)  and my friends mom told me bout rum tea. Its a Caribbean medicine  drink to have when you are sick to help you feel better (Rum, Tea, Garlic, Lemon, Ginger & Honey) it taste amazing and it helps when Im really sick . I was 19 at the time and my brother was 16 when I tried it. I like it so much I was drinking it everyday. I started making tea for my brother to try and he also drank it everyday. Fast forward to today and he is over weight, gone bald at 25, got into 2 major accidents 1 was alcohol related, depressed living in my parents basement, his room always smells with pee bottles,  empty liquor bottles and ask food bags. He does express he is battling with alcohol and basically  needs it to  to stay calm, or level headed and other excuses. 

It hurting my family. My parents dont what what to do he is asking for help but he is not responsible. He throws his money away to party or to buy things he doesn't need. He suggested therapy and my parent are on board but they only will do it if he pays half. Yet he has not saved anything to put up his half. He says he wants help but does no action toward it. What can I do? I know its my fault he has a drinking problem because I gave him the drink that he likes and that's when the problem started.

Obviously mental illness will make you more susceptible to alcoholism. But if you didn’t know, people with undiagnosed or unmedicated ADHD are much more likely to have substance abuse issues. My therapist was once a drug court counselor and told me that nearly all of the kids she worked with had ADHD. She told me that the main drugs of choice were weed and alcohol. 

Once I began my ADHD medication I definitely saw a change in my drinking habits. I now take my 10 MG Dextroamphetamine at 8 AM, and wait to drink til at least 10/12 hours after to avoid any harmful interactions. In the past, once I started drinking, I couldn’t stop. I would regularly down 3/4 of a handle of Svedka in one night and I could never really drink without blacking out because I overdid it. Last week, I got an 8 pack of Smirnoff seltzer’s, a handle of some high alcohol content margarita, and two big cans of Smirnoff smash. That night I had 2 seltzer’s, half a can of the Smirnoff, and I was done for the night. I was actually able to cut myself off. As of now, I still have alcohol left and I was never able to make it last this long. 

Since taking my medication I also notice that I crave alcohol less. I find more pleasure in daily activities that once seemed monotonous and don’t feel like I need to be buzzed to complete them. I enjoy waking up at 8 am everyday, cleaning while listening to podcasts, and keeping my life organized. 

I now know that my previous alcohol over-consumption problem was due to hyper-fixating. I could not stop drinking because my brain was zoned in on the concept of drinking and ADHD causes you to have a hard time switching between tasks. ADHD brains also require a higher amount of stimulation to feel content. I was drinking mainly because everything was boring and being drunk gave me the higher stimulation that I craved. So if you find yourself drinking for this reason, it could be undiagnosed ADHD. 

I am posting this to encourage y’all to think about the possibility of having ADHD. Obviously not all alcoholics have it, but I think it’s worth mentioning. ADHD is very common, but I personally believe that a majority of people in the world suffer from it and just don’t know yet. I wasn’t diagnosed until I started college. I always got straight A’s and was a calm kid so I had no reason to ever look into it.

Since the covid pandemic hit, I’ve been drinking a lot. I’m four days sober at this point. I realized I was simply making excuses each time I’d go through the detox process. It got to the point I could put away a 12 pack of beer, feel like crap the next day, and keep drinking to stave off the hangover. I’ve gotten tired of the eternal anxiety about when I was going to be able to drink again. It wasn’t like I couldn’t stop drinking. I could. But I would make excuses as to why I could continue. It also got to the point where it’s been affecting my work and family life. I work a job with my hands, and during the weekly detox while at work, my hands would shake uncontrollably. Not the most comforting thing when you’re starting an IV on someone. Also not the most comforting thing for yourself when you’re drawing up medication from a vial.

I think I’m through the worst of the detox process. The hand tremors have stopped. I’m still getting the night sweats and nightmares. But those have decreased. I’m actually starting to feel like myself again. Now I just need to clean my house and get rid of all of the reminders of my drinking.

I just wanted to put that out there, as I’ve never been honest with anyone about my drinking. People have had their suspicions, but could never confirm it.

I started to think about that life as an upside-down pyramid with my sobriety being the very bottom building block upon which everything else is built.
And now I think it’s getting harder the further I build. 
Recently a big part of the pyramid has fallen  down and crashed for me. I’ve experienced a tragedy which still haunts me. 
A month ago I was unbelievably happy and looking forward to bright future, now I can hardly imagine happiness. I was so happy and optimistic recently that both me and my psychiatrist decided that it’s time say goodbye to my anti-anxiety pills that I’ve been taking since the very beginning of sobriety. Well guess what? The anxiety is back and I’m planning a next visit with the shrink. 
Back to the topic. I recently started remembering the parties, the concerts, festivals, vacations with friends and many crazy adventures I had. It took me a lot of focus to realise that what I remember were few happy moments in the sea of sorrow. I’ve forced myself to remember the bad things, hangovers,making my loved one cry, constant anxiety, not remembering what I did. Constant dread. I have to force myself to always remember the bad things. I’m sorry if I rambled, I just had to drop those thoughts off my mind to keep sane.

Unfortunately she tried to drink behind my back and when I told her no she started begging me for a drink. Now at that time our fridge was covered wall to wall with fireball and Jack Daniels. 

Recently she’s started to recover more but when we go out she tells me that she’s either having one or two drinks so I have to make sure that she only has one or two. 

She’s been yelling at me a lot recently for unrelated reasons ([you can look at my post on AITA for more context ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/n4ywkr/aita_for_focusing_on_my_mental_health_and_trying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) ) and I wanna leave so bad but feel like I can’t because I don’t want her to start drinking again. 

After I got out of a psych ward (which her yelling caused me to go in) I stayed with my dad because I was to afraid to be with her. One of the nights I was staying with dad I had to go on a call with my godmother, my mom, and one of their friends. Mom was drinking and I said “oh no moms drinking because I made her sad” and she just said “haha you’re right!” so yeah would rather that don’t happen again.

 I’ve been starting having nightmares of her yelling, things she’s told me becoming real, as well as murder (she watches a lot of murder programs).

Do I have a problem?","19 year old male here. I'll try to keep this short, but apologies in advance if it turns out to be an essay. I started drinking last October, originally to help me get through some emotional stuff. Yes I know, I'm young and stupid and I probably don't have any real problems, but I think problems should be measured not in their real depth, but in the effect that they have on someone. Ugh, tangent. I would drink the odd time when I was 17, but always told myself that I wouldn't drink for emotional reasons. One night last October I was feeling particularly bad, and in a moment of weakness decided to open a bottle of wine. That began my regular drinking habits. It started out at about 2 nights a week, back when I used to work a lot of morning shifts. Now I work mainly evening shifts, so I drink about 4-5 nights a week. Like I said it started off as a way to make myself feel better in the later hours of the day, but lately things have been improving for me, however I'm in a bit of a habit of drinking now. I believe that I could stop drinking if I wanted to, but for some reason I really don't want to. I'm concerned that that's how the mind of an addict works. There are quite a few heavy drinkers in my family, and I have a tendency to get addicted to things like gaming, and gambling. As I type this I'm not really worried about my drinking, but I feel like maybe I should be. I usually get a naggin of vodka or whiskey after work, or sometimes a bottle of wine. I drink what I buy on the night that I buy it. I don't get seriously drunk, just a little drunk and I never feel hungover in the morning. I know I'm kind of rambling on here, but I suppose what I'm trying to ask is:
Does this sound like the start of a real issue?
Will my alcohol consumption have negative effects on my physical and/or mental health? 
Also, do genetics have an effect on alcohol addiction?

During the week I don't feel a need to drink at all unless a friend comes over or something then that will trigger me bc I feel like they are bored not drinking and I also feel bored and anxious. So last weekend my friend came over that doesn't drink at all and does not want me to drink either. I thought maybe she would be a good support friend. Her and my boyfriend both do not want me to drink. But then they started pulling out crazy bongs and vaporizer and saying things like I'm so fucked up right now. I'm not going to lie it made me jealous. It made me jealous bc they don't have a problem and can get super fucked up and not be sober without doing stupid things. I wanted to not be sober with them. I don't smoke weed at all I just don't like it. Before when I got sober I was around no one but myself bc whenever I hangout with anyone they were smoking weed or popping pills (which I have a problem with neither) it still made me feel uncomfortable and made me wanna drink. Maybe I guess to feel more comfortable around them? I live with my boyfriend and he really wants me to quit drinking badly bc he is scared for me and he definitely should be. I told him I would seriously try to stop if he would stop smoking weed or at least smoking it around me and he told me he is never going to do that and that I am just making excuses bc I want to drink. Which maybe I am but even if I do want to drink I do also want to stop. Idk just seeing peoples opinions?,2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7038903}"

 A quick background, I used to be an extremely heavy drinker, 6-7 days a week, drinking an entire bottle as a 130lb woman in my early to mid twenties. I was abusing drugs as well, but was so focused on that it was all just bc “I was a party girl” and nothing else. I always would say I was just having fun although I’ve put myself in very awful situations and I’m so lucky that I never harmed anyone or myself and frankly that I’m still alive. 4 years ago, I got into a relationship with the man I’m engaged to now. My drinking and drug habits stayed consistent about 7-8 months into our relationship until we realized alcohol was causing a lot of issues for us, so we agreed to try to slow down on drinking. I also quit using drugs, except weed, at this point. I went about 1.5 year without drinking super often (maybe 3x a month) but any time I drank, I went as hard as I could. I would literally get angry with my partner if he just wanted to have a beer at the bar and leave because I felt like I had so few opportunities to drink and that he was taking them away from me. It was taking a toll on our relationship because I was wanting to drink more, but drinking less only for the sake of our relationship, not for myself. Because my partner does have a healthy relationship with alcohol, I was able to establish that my relationship was way different. We went out for New Year’s Eve 2019-2020 and that was the last time I drank. I made it my goal to not drink all of 2020 and achieved that (although I had plenty of breakdowns and hard moments, but I never gave in) and I decided that it’s best for me to stay sober after my year of reflecting on my dangerous habits when I drank.
I never knew if I was an alcoholic or what to call myself or anything. I was scared to go to meetings and get support bc maybe Im not an alcoholic because I’ve been able to stay sober. However, I do get really jealous of people that drink, almost passive aggressively angry, and constantly have dreams about drinking and doing drugs. It’s on my mind a lot. With getting engaged recently I started to panic thinking about having to be sober at my wedding, worrying it won’t be fun or enjoyable (what if I get upset seeing our guests drinking/getting drunk?) and I even toyed with the idea if I could start drinking champagne/spritzers again. Although I’m fairly confident that would lead to liquor after 30 minutes of drinking “light”
I watched some YouTube videos from the page psychology in Seattle and from that I think I may have been white knuckling through these past few years (sorry if this terminology is being used completely wrong here, it just seemed to make sense to me but idk). I have people pleasing tendencies and I know my fiancé is really proud and supportive that I stopped drinking, but I’m nervous maybe I set out to quit drinking more for him and our relationship than for me...although now I realize that I’ll never be able to have any kind of relationship with alcohol. This past year and half (although stressful from the pandemic) kind of made it easier for me. No bars were open anyway and my fiancé and I don’t keep alcohol at our house (his support is amazing). I know life has ups and downs and I’m worried that if I hit a rough patch, I might relapse if I don’t seek support and have a community of others who don’t drink at all. I just worry my situation is bizarre and others might not understand and idk where to start. I still struggle a lot emotionally with the idea of not having alcohol in my life. Just looking for any suggestions on where to start to reach out for more of a support system from other people who don’t drink at all.

Sorry if this is a bit all over the place, I’m feeling really overwhelmed with all this....

My dad had a fall in Feb while his blood alcohol level was in the .300s . 2 brain bleeds and 1 month of severe acute withdrawal later, that left him near a vegetable for a few weeks there. And in April suddenly he was awake and talking again but he can’t do anything for himself. He is lost in time and space memory wise. Brain soup I’ve come to call it. He has only his wife, Val, to help care for him. There is a very long story of the hospital stay and them trying to dump him in a hole of a place they called a “care home” that even in the 24 hours he was there was treated horribly with disregard and neglect. And they said he’d never get better when he was still unresponsive.

Well he proved that wrong but he still can't do for himself. Can only just barely sit up on his own. The bigger issue is they have no income. He was taking care of things at home and his stepdaughter for the last few years while his wife worked, and then when Covid hit Val decided to go back to school for nuclear medicine. Val had to send her own special needs daughter to live with he sister while she trying to sort all this out.  They were living off her savings. Insurance screwed them over. The hospital used doctors out of their network even though the hospital was supposed to be in their network. Insurance keeps insisting they need to try home visits first before they will approve him for coverage for a skilled nursing facility. HE NEEDS TO BE IN A FACILITY where he can get rehab for motor skills, speech, mental, etc. etc...  and have people who know how to deal with everything else that he's not capable of doing for himself that she just doesn’t have the physical strength, knowledge, or medical equipment to deal with. They have crazy medical bills from the hospital using out of network doctors that she can’t pay and also because of this, they haven’t even met their deductible yet. So she can’t afford the in home services. She’s trying to get him approved for Medicaid but that’s been coming with it’s own road blocks. 

SHE CANNOT CARE FOR HIM ALONE. But no one will help her. He can not function on his own. He won’t keep a diaper on. He can’t get out of the bed. He has bedsores. If he ever tries to get up and walk and falls, due to the brain bleeds, he’s probably toast. If he learns to walk on his own without falling he is a wandering risk as he can’t remember where he is or what year he is living in. And starting tomorrow she will have no choice left but to leave him alone for full day shifts while she attends school. (She is studying nuclear medicine)

She is close to losing her house. She ran out of money to pay for a sitter for him. He was denied Disability because he hasn’t works 5 out of the last 10 years while he was being the homemaker and dealing with other stuff. He doesn’t yet qualify for SS. Lawyers are telling her the only way to get him help is to divorce him or abandon him. It’s all so messed up and I can’t help thinking some of this is due to the stigma of the drinking. Yes, he had a problem. No, no one knew how bad it was cause he carried/hid it well. I'm sure it was tied to undiagnosed depression. But he's in Houston Texas and I’m stuck up in Canada where I live with my husband and 2 young children and can’t be there to physically help. She has reached dead end after dead end and is about to give up.

This is all so messed up so I’m reaching out wherever I can. Please... please help point us in a direction. Is there anything that can help us fight this disaster? How can the system just screw them over again and again like this? My heart is breaking and my head is raging.

Last week, late Tuesday night, I couldn't sleep. I'd been boozing pretty consistently from the Saturday evening,¹ half of Sunday, all Monday and Tuesday, even through work (I work at home so this wasn't too much of an issue).

Anyway, I started to experience a fast heart rate, and chest discomfort/pain. I panicked completely and called 111. Long story short, ended up in hospital all day Wednesday. Had 3 blood tests, an X Ray of my chest, and 3 ECG tests. The only reason I was kept in was the ECG tests, which had an abnormality in. I saw a cardiologist and he assured me there were no problems with my heart considering all the answers I gave (I was really honest about everything, including my alcohol consumption). 

That day and the next day I drank no booze and it felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest. I didnt feel any discomfort or heaviness bar a jolt here and there (something the cardiologist attributed to stress, depression and anxiety). 

So of course with a clean bill of health, I drank Friday night. Saturday day time too, and the evening. Today I woke up and the discomfort in my chest is back. I've tried Paracetamol, ibuprofen gel and hydrating myself with lots of water (something they did at the hospital) but my chest feels so heavy...I'm wondering if I should go back.

i mean, just today, i started drinking 11am this morning. it is now almost 11pm and i am still quite  buzzed (lightwight dont need too much alcohol to get me going) and im just wondering. do i have a problem? how do i quell it at the source?

and like i said i am a trans person. would rather not disclose pronouns since i do not want to be misgendered purposefully in dms but i am on HRT and have been for the past 3 or so months and i just do not know what to do. i feel fine when i drink, i dont feel like an impostor, i dont feel like the ""wrong person"" in the ""wrong body"" i just feel like how i am supposed to feel

if you have transphobic comments i dont mind. rather direct them towards me than towards someone more vulnerable, i do not mind. i do not care, its ok. i just need advice on how to nip this behavior in the bud before it becomes my undoing.

Of course, no individual can compare themselves to others and be happy. That's a truth of life. We all must follow our own path and examine our own lives....
Anyway, I'm now in probation for a year,  which bans drinking alcohol, the only condition that really gives me an issue. I hate to say it, but I most likely would not be addressing this now if now for the probation. 

I just can't imagine life without it. Ideally, I'd like to be able to just be chilling after work with one or 2 beers, or have a glass of wine or little whiskey with my family or friends, casually....I hate ...cannot imagine...the concept of giving it up completely.

The hardest part for me is that throughout recent times, I have found a way, or my lifestyle permitted me to incorporate drinking into everything, all aspects of my life. I smuggled it into work, or if I'm off, drinking during my daily activities. Now, I'm currently out of work. When I really examine deeply, the drinking did cause this. 
I'm naturally a ""late"" person, but frequent hangovers caused me to be too late for work, and thus was terminated. I limit who I hang with or what I do based on how easily I am able to drink or can access alcohol. It goes with me whenever I drive somewhere. And thanks to a friend, I started drinking beer in the morning sometimes,...coffee is a distant memory. 

I still don't think my problem is a crisis or anything, but do know I should cut down. To say ""quit completely"" is too hard for me right now. But going to jail is something I cannot handle. And I know I could become much healthier, more fit. Life could only get better if I quit this habit. 

I have spent too much time feeling sick, shameful, regretful, spent so much money. My hard earned money which gets hella taxed. Fell asleep in parking lots. Or woke up with no clothes or weird situations. Horrible memory problems. Lack of control. 

Buuut....giving it up is just unimaginable. What could comfort me or take its place? I think I would just feel so empty. It doesn't help at all that I have deep self esteem issues, very low self confidence, and am a self-saboteur by nature. I have indeed achieved feelings of self confidence under the influence greater than I could naturally attain otherwise.

Despite my negative attributes, I feel that in general I tend to exude positive vibes, and  keep good intentions. And possess resilience. I love being outside, want to be healthy...maintain health. Can probably change. I want to read more positive/ successful accounts and hoping I can find some inspirational stories here....also want to try to attend AA, find some positive friends, maybe even talk to my family about it (which would be super difficult but maybe helpful). 

It doesn't help that I tend to go back and forth with resolutions, decisions, thoughts, everything. Just a rant. I know that I typically do not do anything I don't want to (used to be a 'doormat' in the past and gradually was able to stand up for myself) but tend to be indecisive and compromise with myself.

Typically I  bing drink on the weekends. It's very systematic. I begin 4-5 hours after a meal, measure out~7oz/shots of liquor, and drink it pretty quick. Over the next 2-3 hours I drink about one beer an hour, each usually 500ml. Following that, I drink 2-3 more beers over a period of anywhere from 2.5-3.5 hours. I do this twice, sometimes three times on a long weekend. During the week I don't drink aside from occasional wine with dinner.

For genetics, my maternal grandmother is 90, and my maternal grandfather passed away at 91. My paternal grandparents both passed away in their 60s, while my great uncle died at 90. My father is in his 80's, and chain smoked and, in his words, ""was drunk from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning"" for most of his adult life. There is no history of liver problems on either side. 

For my part, I am in my early 30's. I work a desk job and exercise regularly. Religiously get in at least 110 minutes of running plus powerwalking and three days of strength training a week. I am on the heavier side though, albeit with body fat in the higher normal range, and over the past year my diet has not been the best. I have never noticed symptoms of liver damage, however I know it is not always symptomatic. I do not use needles or have unprotected sex with strangers. 

I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate to ask here. I'm kind of a hypochondriac, and I tend to get very stressed out very easily. I know the easiest answer is ""don't drink"" and ""see your doctor"", but I'm unlikely to be able to do the latter any time soon and even though I know it's ridiculous, I'm scared of what they might find or say. So I wanted to see if people with no connection to me would say about how I've been carrying on. Thank you for anything you have to say!

I am  24 now, and finishing my master's degree. I've always drank, and gone on the occasional bender over the weekends. But something changed about 2 years ago. Finally found friends in uni, and everyone drank as well. And so we drank, almost every day. We'd go to the pub, have a few glasses of wine or pints of beer. I never thought of it as a serious issue, as I could go without it and only drank with others.

I tried to talk to him about it. He said, he knows it’s a lot, but one day, he just don’t want to drink anymore and than he will just stop. He needs it to relax and likes the feeling of „being a little drunk“. 

I think, he is way past the moment where he just could have stopped. I told him that. I told him, I’m worried sick. Especially when I know, he often throws up in the morning. I asked him, to go to therapy. To get help. To reduce his drinking. Nothing helps. 

He never got really aggressive towards me, but he lost his drivers license because of it. So he knows his drinking has consequences. But nevertheless he won’t stop or reduce.

They have put me in the hospital numerous times, seen me drink myself to near death in hotel rooms across Canada, and witnessed me be fired from solid jobs and miss very promising interviews for the sake of drinking and using.

Drink and drugs can bring me to an irrational sort of place: one between life and a diminished existence that can border on erasure. At certain times I won't care about people, my health or anything external to obtaining the next drink or hit. The fact that picking could very well lead to erasing near all forces of positivity in my life for a short time or a long time, does not matter. It is a curious and tenacious mental blank spot.

The only witness protection program that I know of that can consistently head off drinks and drugs is a daily program of action called Alcoholics Anonymous.

I'm 35, been drinking fairly heavily since I was about 25. When it go really bad, during quarantine, I started getting withdrawal symptoms (panic attacks, sweating, vomiting... you know, the usual) and it scared me. So I managed to quit for a little while. 
However, I got back into it, to help me sleep. Foolishly I thought I could control it but I've recently found out how wrong I was. 
I've needed to day drink to stave off the anxiety and nausea, and needed more and more.

Now, as I am in a poor position to have a doctor or do a rehab or detox, I have settled on the safest method I could find, a slow and steady tapering, starting at a drink an hour and adding a half hour every day or so. Using my phone and watch's digital assistant to set reminders, it's been a fairly smooth, if not somewhat uncomfortable experience. I'm up to 2 and a half hours as of today! It's early but progress is progress, right?

I decided to come and post here, because I was made aware of the fact that having a community to talk to is always a big help, and this seemed the best place to go!

I turned 21 in January, but I've been drinking regularly since I turned 20. I have a fast metabolism and an addictive personality, which I've known since I started smoking cigarettes and hand rolled ""cigarettes"" at 14 and 13, respectively. In that time I've gone from hard shots to a 1.75 mL every other day. 

I can't think of many hours a day that I'm 100% sober, whether hand rolls or alc. I feel like I'm spiraling, but when I try and slow down I treat loved ones poorly and in general just feel terrible physically and emotionally. In the past month it has reached the point where I keep a bottle in my trunk and have a drink in my car at lunch (I don't drive it's just for the privacy). I've had puking episodes including one where I puked blood, where I had friends with me to take care of me. I feel like it's turning more into an emotional norm and a burden on others than a leisure. It's embarrassing to say but I've had friends tell me that I have an issue, but I just joke it off, and those moments just eat away at the back of mind.

I go to a ""party school"" but have no 21+ friends, and have a poor relationship with my parents, so I'm not quite sure where I stand. Am I just a partying 21year old that likes drinking or am I on a downward spiral that I need to work on now? I feel like I know the answer already, but I need outside opinions to ease the load my own mind has been bearing recently.

I'm trying to respond back to everyone because I truly am grateful, from the ""you should have a look at it"" to the ""your time remaining is short if you keep this up"", these replies were the wakeup call that I know I needed.

In my teens and early 20s I did everything a fun outgoing person would- some parties, getting shitfaced on weekends or just having a glass at dinner. Never worried about it. 

But then life started- at around 25 I started developing a problematic relationship with alcohol. At that time Iwas depressed and unhappy, i would nearly daily secretly chug 1/2-1 bottles of wine before my evening shift at a restaurant and just go work like nothing happened, that lasted maybe 3months.
I did eventually stop doing that but this pattern repeated at least once every 1 or 2 years if I had something stressful going on, like stress at work or breakups. 

Fast forward to 2020 - covid started. All through this last year I have been drinking literally daily. Just a couple of beers or a couple of glasses of wine, not getting too drunk but not missing a night either. i also sometimes did that in secret.

The worst (or the best) part it that my partner does not drink at all so whenever im having a drink with dinner- im the only one drinking. I would go to the liquor store once a week and get a bunch of alcohol to last me a week (carefully calculate how much i need as I was full on planning to drink every day).

 I felt embarrassed to stock my fridge with 20 beers weekly, i felt embarrassed to get the same cashier at the liquor store, I felt embarrassed taking out the recycling so often because it would fill my empties, I felt embarrassed when my partner would ask if I needed to go to the liquor store everytime we walked past it. 

I have not had any alcohol in the last 5 days. Physically - I feel better and sleep better too. But I do think about it daily, everyday I have to convince myself to not go to the liquor store. I also get obsessive thought like 'what if i just have drinks on weekends like a normal person, I should just get some just for tonight'. 
I keep thinking about having drinks all day but at night I feel so fucking proud of myself for not giving in. 

I have not done much research about it. I just know that this is not normal, its very embarrassing and scary. I have let it go for too long and I dont want this to turn into something i cannot control. Am I ok to have drinks in social situations? Should I just not drink ever again? How does that work? Anyone else has a similar story? I know I have a problem but I get away with it so i keep justifying doing it.

My mom has been drinking since I can think. I have a memory of it when I was 6 and she had a fight with my dad because she wanted to drive as drunk as she were. There are a lot of other memories too, most of them really painful. 

I'm turning 21 soon and because of corona I'm still living with my parents right now. That's also why I'm hypervigilant with everything she does. I tend to see everytime she takes her glass and recognize every small change in her mood. And while she gets more drunk and more aggressive (when she's mad about smth), **I tend to shut down, get deeply tired and emotionless (does anybody know why I react like that? I can't even control it)**. 

She never hit me (I can't say that for my dad, I don't know), but when she's like that, she likes to get verbally aggressive, puts us down, takes everything personally, tries to hurt us. I have a whole list of things she said to me. I even conceal things because I'm scared she'll use them against me (which she often did before). 

I don't even think it's that bad. She's still working and doesn't skip work for drinking. There are days she doesn't drink at all. And not every day she actually *is* drinking is a bad day. It's like every three weeks or smth that she's overdoing it and gets mad. 

However, my dad's codependent and I'm too scared to talk to her. I'd like her to stop hurting me, but I think she even sees me as an enemy when she's not drunk. Which I understand. I think I've been unfriendly a lot lately because of the whole alcoholism thing and we just drift apart. But I can't take it when she's like that! 

Next week is her birthday and she'll invite her friends. Of course they'll drink. And I just want it to end....

Sober for almost two months after drinking too much for a little over half a year. Haven't been drinking because therapist/doctor said they couldn't treat or diagnose me if I was using. 

Today I talked to my therapist about it and I told her that my long term strategy is getting a healthy relationship with alcohol, and that I have two rules: never drink alone, and don't drink too much around other people. She told me that I wasn't really an alcoholic in the sense they usually see, which I agreed with, and that drinking with my friends or having a beer with my family isn't really the type of problem they are talking about. And I agree. I don't think all alcohol abuse is equal and if you think so, you're probably not the type of person I'd get along with. Sorry. 

The problem is that something in my brain feels like they gave me permission to start drinking again and I'm not fucking fine with it. I feel like any alcohol right now is simply playing with fire. I don't even drink alcohol free beer as I'm afraid it'd be a slippery slope to a full on day-drinking relapse. 

I don't know, I really just needed to vent. I'm not going to drink and my long term plan is still what I laid out. I just felt like it was a little too much a little too soon and that I'm not really in a place where I can tolerate any amount of alcohol without risking it all going to shit.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8084413}"

My husband has been a drinker since he was 19. He’s 28 now and I thought he was cutting back a lot on drinking, I find out he has not been cutting back barely at all. 

He has a history of very heavy drinking and would blackout or pass out weekly I would say many years ago. It took a toll on our relationship and caused other issues and we broke up. We got back to ether about 9 months later, he seemed to have matured some and controlled his drinking. The following year he goes back into drinking whenever he’s stressed and ends up getting a DUI. This is 6 months after he proposed to me and we were supposed to be getting married that summer with a destination wedding. Well that ended up not happening clearly since he was put on probation and couldn’t leave the state or drink at all for a year. He did great on his probation and completed it in a year. His classes he went to and therapy seemed to help his drinking habit. Fast forward to today, which is a year after he completed probation/therapy. We lost a baby a few weeks ago so that has been very difficult. I’m not sure when he started hiding the alcohol but I would guess for a few months, maybe longer. I thought he was drinking a pint or two of vodka on the weekends and probably 3-4 strong beers daily during the week, AT MOST. Some weeks he would only drink some on the weekends because I do not drink very much and when I got pregnant wasn’t drinking at all. He slowed down (so I thought) after we lost our baby because the doctor advised to cut back a lot on alcohol if you want healthy sperm/egg (as well as take several supplements). I have done a great deal of research and spoken to doctors about how we can better our chances of having a healthy baby and I feel completely betrayed that he would still choose to drink heavily and lie about it all while making diet changes to be healthier and take these 6 different supplements daily. My question is, how do I know he actually wants to change and to what extent to I trust him? Usually he tells the truth but alcohol is his weakness when he is stressed. I do not appreciate being lied to and having to deal with someone who can’t control their alcohol consumption.  The impulsivity in me wants to kick him out because I am so angry but since we are married it is not as simple as that. What do I do?? And how do I know he is genuine if he says he wants to cut back again? Because I believe him before yet he would hide bottles in his gaming room and I found them.

I'm 24 and from the UK and deal with the weekend ritual of going out Friday and Saturday and in the case of this last weekend Sunday as well. I drink to extreme intoxication and am unable to stop once started while also smoking. Been doing this solidly since I was 18 with the exception of the pandemic. 

About a couple of years back I started getting a hangover symptom where I feel loss of sensation in my skin, Eyes feel sunken in, decreased appetite and loss of taste. This only happens the day after the initial hangover and stops after more sleep and in the case of the pandemic didn't happen once (Don't drink in the house)  if I don't drink again or if I don't drink alot one of the weekends this dousn't happen. Only on extreme binges. 

I know I should probably see a GP about this and I will do but wanted to see if anybody else has experienced this. Another side effect is I sometimes wake up screaming and it feels like I've had a stroke or something but I suffer from panic disorders and I quickly calm myself back down and go back to sleep.

Probably worth mentioning I've got mild Cerebral Palsy so very well could be some side effects from binging with that.

Thanks guys in advance",2,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6147233}"

What are some some ways that I can use to confirm whether he's drunk or not.,"When I look at my dads eyes, it looks a little strange. I don't know how to describe it, but it looks similar to the eyes my dad had when he was still drinking. He also seem very sad for some reason. Also last night, my dad was being a bit defensive. He went into the balcony, and entered the storage room and closed it for a couple of seconds and left. When I started walking towards the door, he opened the door, sounding a bit defensive. I feel like he was trying to hide the fact that he was drinking. My dad hasn't been drinking at all for a couple of months now (except he's still drinking NA), and sometimes I get really paranoid, so it might just be me. But since yesterday was Memorial Day (my dad's a veteran and lost a couple of friends), I'm worried that he could have used it as an excuse to drink. I also can't ask anyone else since my brother can't tell the difference between drunk and sober dad, and my mom is at work at the moment so I can't rely on them for help.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72025234}"

I want to preface that I'm not here to ""fix"" him because I know anyone with an addiction is going to be unwilling until they want to do something about it. I came here seeking suggestions on how to not get caught up in their problems? All google links are about how to help them with their problem instead of how to cope and deal with it from the S/O's end.

To lay out my situation: my boyfriend isn't a typical 'bad' drunk- he's just boring sober. He doesn't verbally or physically abuse me, he doesn't emotionally manipulate me, and he doesn't hurt others or himself. He drinks anywhere between a 6 pack of beer to about a fifth a day. When he doesn't drink, he's just a blob who can't sleep and doesn't want to exist.

It's becoming exhausting going through the waves of his personality (even though alcohol gives him way more dimension). His hot and cold levels of attention towards me made me feel like I was being cheated on or that he wasn't emotionally invested in me in the past. We talked that one out and I'm convinced his inconsistency is a symptom to his alcoholism. I enjoy my partner's company but alcohol is starting to noticeably get in between moving forward together as a couple. I feel frustrated he cares more about the bottle than he does about creating a future with me and I'm doing my best not to take it personally. 

I feel alone. No one talks about how alone you feel dating someone who drinks a lot. If someone doesn't act ""bad enough"" for it to be a problem, how can you rationalize that it's not good for them? Is it possible to continue a relationship without trying to help someone's addiction? Is that selfish of me to think that their alcohol problem is something they need to solve outside the relationship?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7331243}"

For once. A steady new job, attended five AA meetings per week, a good peer support system, new friends, new location. All it took to ruin it all was an urge to buy a pint of vodka. I smelled of it and was given a breathalyzer. Now I am back to square one, being scolded and berated by the person who claims to have helped me the most. Lacking motivation again to do anything worthwhile. I also completed 30 days of rehab, which was court ordered. That was a miracle in itself.

I never did find an AA sponsor or do the twelve steps. The guy I had in mind was busy with work and never called back, on top of everything else. What do I do now?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44833994}"

Opportunities missed by choice, what was I thinking?

I lay in my bed all day yesterday, even when it got dark it was just me, the ceiling fan and reconsideration of choices. The way I see it, it's just efficient vs stupid choices and therefore the consequences attached to them. 

Funny thing is, I used to be this stoic and calculative, unaffected and just absolutely crushing life, and I LOVED it. I was the cornerstone to a lot of people's effective decision making and my own choices were splendid to say the least. I had no business having the amount of money I had from the age of 20-24. 

Was it my alcoholic father's demise? Or the two breakups, one before his demise and one after, that altered me and I stopped caring about myself? These were the thoughts I was having last night. I carried such mental fortitude, I barely cried when pops died, I was more angry upon him than sad for him, probably the poorest choice of all. 

It went from me just doing things to me gradually not doing anything. From me remembering everything but 'just a drink please' to remembering just the drink. I have to rearrange, I have to recalibrate. 

I tried all the other options too. I believe a lot of us did the same thing, the first thing we did when we started damaging by drinking was damage control, which eventually means self-isolatiom because if you're around nobody, nobody is getting hurt, rarely do we realize we picked the gatepass to literal hell. 

I slowly started losing a lot of relationships and a lot of respect, it's amazing how the tree didn't fall completely and that I'm still somehow loved by people but how do I get back to being the 20 year old at 27? It's simple, I absolutely need to start doing everything before I begin thinking about the drinking, don't we all love a healthy bank balance over a hangover? Don't we all love a cozy bunch of friends and partners over gazes of disgust? 

Alcohol sure was a catalyst in rupturing everything but it was me, myself, this very able body and mind that bent itself around the substance, it was my choices and it's still is mine to pick better ones. 

As exhausted as we feel in the dystopia we created as energetic would we feel in the normalcy we bring forth. I want peace and financial stability over everything and unwavering respect to add to that, I don't want the drink but I'm unsure if I'll stay away, but I am sure I'll just start doing everything patiently, I will thaw out the ice mercilessly till the sculpture of myself glistens. I will not curse myself over a relapse but also would I stay the FUCK AWAY FROM THE MOTHERFUCKING BOTTLE. 

There's just a few things worth holding onto, it's the work ethic, humility and responsibility. It felt great when it lasted and I wanna feel that great again, I don't want to feel paranoid anymore. I went from owning bikes and cars to not being able to afford new slippers, all over the flawed choice of the bottle which I couldn't understand the reason for. Imma take these hands off the bottle and join them in prayer instead. I need god, family and community more than any substance and it's clear as day to me. So reddit folks, just pray for me and I'll do the same for all you beautiful drunks. Amen.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4099264}"
