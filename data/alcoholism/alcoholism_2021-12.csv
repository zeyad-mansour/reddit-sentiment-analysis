Convinced my partner that it would be okay to come the next day for Christmas. I woke up in the hotel and started packing to leave. I didn't want to drive with open containers I'm my car, so I chugged all the whiskey and wine I had left. My memory got foggy, I don't remember driving to her house.
She came home from Christmas morning with her daughter and asked me to take another COVID test and I lost it. Completely blacked out, calling her names, telling her to put the test in her ass, etc. I don't remember any of it. She left the house and drove around for like 8hrs. I came to wondering where she was.
She didn't leave me. But it was close. I decided that I need to go to rehab but I just wanted some time and space first, so I drove 2hrs away to visit an old friend. An old friend who is also a serious alcoholic. We drank heavily together for days and I woke up today and decided enough is enough. I sat in a rehab facility all day, only to be turned away because they couldn't verify my residency. Not even a bank statement was enough. Meanwhile, my withdrawal symptoms are getting worse and worse. I'm sitting in a hospital right now hoping they can help ease the pain. I've been waiting for hours.

I'm 20F and I live with my mom (45). My mom got out of a 7 year long relationship and, although she won't admit it, it wasn't a good one. Ever since, she was diagnosed with depression (although her doctor and I believe she's always been somewhat depressed, but this particular event triggered an intense depressive episode) and is currently taking anti-depressants.

When they used to date (especially near the end) she'd drink before he arrived because she felt like she had to loosen up so she wouldn't be anxious in his presense. But since they broke up, as you can imagine, she's been drinking a lot more.

We have a close relationship and I've tried to talk to her several times and encouraged her to talk about this issue with her psychiatrist, but she only asked if it was okay to drink with her medication. The main issue I'd say is that she can't recognize this is a problem and acts as if it's something everyone does to 'feel better'.

She doesn't drink heavy stuff, mostly a bottle of wine and sometimes licour. Sometimes when I find them I hide the bottles, but it hasn't worked for the past few months. Regardless of the Actual alchool intake, I worry about her health and how this might affect her in the future.

I'm afraid I might sound mean sometimes when we discuss this issue but it has taken a tool on my mental health as well.

I've been trying to deal with this just the two of us, but when I mentioned talking to my aunt about this she threatened to kick me out.

(i.e. trauma),"My boyfriend is an alcoholic. Sometimes he does really well by staying sober for months at a time. Other times he’ll get blackout drunk multiple times a week. He shows a lot of signs of past trauma in his personality and it seems like there’s this undercurrent of stress and sadness he always has. I’ve asked him a handful of times but he never opens up about it. Even when drunk. I’ve asked what he’s running from, if something happened, why he always needs to escape. After a while I just dropped it. I don’t think I’ve asked or he’s talked about it in over 8 months. He just passively says his dad was shitty, but I’ve met his family and all his other siblings and the family dynamic seems healthy. While he’s struggled since high school. I know it’s not my business to know, but I can’t help but feel there’s a lot about his past that he can’t even come to terms with. We’ve been together for a year now. 

Anyways, what I’m getting at is are all alcoholics running from something? Trauma is highly personal and one thing that seems awful to one person isn’t that big of deal to others. Everyone responds differently. In my mind the worse the alcoholism the harder someone’s life is or was or more traumatic.

Am I over thinking this? All this time I can’t really gather the exact reason he drinks. He just says stress from work, but I feel like there has to be more going on. Maybe I’m over complicating it.

Hi.  My best friend  has chronic pain from an excess of radiation  after her  breast cancer surgery ten years ago.  She also is a recovering  alcoholic, as am I.

Though she periodically  gets injections, I'm nor sure of what, and has tried various anti-pain  modalities, she finds her pain becoming increasingly unmanageable and  confining her to staying home all day with a hot pad.  She has had  little success in finding a doctor who would issue pain killers for  her--presumably due to the alcoholism but perhaps also due to the  vagueness associated with tissue-generated pain.  In fact, I am pretty sure they write this off as 'drug-seeking' and don't want to bother with her case. 

Recently,  she has struggled maintaining alcohol sobriety and have begun to use alcohol  as a pain killer. This which causes her to feel like a loser, even  though she didn't continue the 'slips' with continuous drinking. She was  able to stop after each episode..  And then when the pain got too much,  she drank again.

On Christmas Eve  she went back to Rehab for her alcoholic slips.  Now she is in the the  Psychiatric Ward with suicidal depression.  Yet, I'm afraid, nobody is  going to even ATTEMPT to diagnose and deal with her pain, which is, as I  see it, the root issue.   The issue is also complicated because she was  using Kratom as a pain killer some time ago, and because of that, also  got an Rx for Suboxone, with the intent to prevent her from becoming   addicted to opiods.  But it's a double-edged sword in that it is  another 'black mark' in terms of her looking like a  drug-seeker rather  than a pain victim.

But what do  you do when the only path to halving a pain-free life is THRU opioids?   It seems like the medical profession has swung so far away from  prescribing these for fear of misuse that people with legitimate needs  for them are forced to live with intolerable pain or kill themselves!  Has anybody any similar experiences that could help my friend?

I  am even thinking perhaps I should recommend she move to another  country, like somewhere in Central America, where she could get what she  needed free of the anti-drug hysteria.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7871156}"

I could use some advice.,"Late 30s relatively healthy male checking in.  I have been heavily drinking as a sort of functional alcohol since probably college.  Last year I quit from Jan-March (completely abstained) and then did so again in October, mostly just because I wanted to lose weight.

I've been drinking fairly heavily for a lot of time this month (typically start at \~6 after work while playing computer and then stop around 10 so I can go to bed, wake up sober, do my work day, and get back at it.  I'd say i consume about 1.75Liters of Jack Daniels every 3-4 days.  Throughout the usual year I fluctuate, mostly drinking a lot on the weekends and not at all during the week but with the pandemic I drink weeknights more often because I dont have to be up and physically at work the next day.

I'm interested in stopping again mostly because I'm getting physical withdrawal symptoms.  I dont think im addicted from the I NEED TO DRINK standpoint, but moreso because my body is hurting.  About \~12-24 hours after drinking I will start to get shooting pains in my left arm and can then feel my heart tightness or weirdness when laying down.  If I stand and pace it usually fixes this.  I also get cramps.  My research says this is mostly due to vitamin deficiency due to the alcohol consumption but who knows for sure.

Anyways all of this is saying that I really want to quit, but I'm just worried about some of the physical aspects.  The heart feelings and arm pain are concerning but from previous experience with abstaining they usually go away after 3-4 days.  I can definitely say right now that the only reason I would consider drinking tonight or the rest of this week is just to stave off the foot cramps and occasional flutters.

Long story short, would love to get any thoughts from folks that have tapered in the past.  I am off work for the holidays so unfortunately while I would have the time to drink and have fun I think the best thing to do now is take a break, as I was going to try to do dry Jan/Feb like I did last year.  If I need to have a few drinks tonight and less and less etc I am open minded to that but wanted to engage with this community for thoughts.

Thanks!

Also I do plan on seeing a doctor for a physical and am not soliciting medical advice, but am curious about peoples experience with similar phyiscal withdraws, as well as tapering - so hopefully I am not breaking rule #2.

I can't eat without drinking, and eating triggers me to drink. 

 Now this is completely unsustainable, my weight is dropping rapidly and I feel like death, starting to lose my ability to focus, get muscle cramps etc. Is this linked to the alcohol or lack of? I assume this may be psychological or have I truely fucked up my stomach somehow? Anyone else? 

 Already lost 26kg this year through my drinking spiralling but desperately trying to get sober. 
Can just about keep a meal replacement shake down 50% of the time, threw up Christmas dinner while playing scrabble, really quite embarrassing. 

Just wondering if anyone had any experiences similar? Feel a bit weird as everyone's always saying how people should eat sugar and I'll be hungry all the time in sobriety, but I'm not.

Why do you suppose? It's evidence based, clinically proven.

Like most people with this medical condition (AUD) you probably haven't been told about short-term, as-needed, naltrexone and the method of taking it before drinking to help your brain taper down to any level you want (alcohol-free being the healthiest goal). Cravings and obsessive thoughts for alcohol slowly disappear.  The brain rewires and heals itself. This method can work for 3 out of 4 people that can stick to the one rule method for 4-12 months. You use less and less naltrexone as the months pass.

Do not ignore this science.

2021-12-27 02:17:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/rphnig/i_think_my_husband_peed_in_the_babys_crib_while/,I think my husband peed in the baby's crib while sleepwalking,"Occasionally when my husband drinks, he sleep walks. And every time he sleep walks he pees...on something. It's usually the closet, but I've woken up with him next to my nightstand about to urinate all over it. The last time he did it he swore he didn't have ""that much"" to drink. He also isn't coherent when it happens. The last time I was talking to him after he peed and he kept talking about how he was trying to bake a cake but the judges won't like it (we'd been watching GBBO). I've worried that if there were an emergency that I wouldn't be able to get him out of the house by myself.

I honestly don't know what his definition of not that much is. He drinks a handle of vodka every weekend between Thursday and Sunday, all between the hours of like 6 pm to 1am. He stays sober (he smokes weed, just no booze) Sunday night to Wednesday, but on a weekend, once he starts drinking he just doesn't have an off button. He's a big guy, but 1/3 of a handle a night is a lot of alcohol. I worry about his health. 

Now, he's never been violent or mean or anything. Ever. He actually is just a very jolly drinker, which probably means I've enabled him a bit. Sometimes when he's particularly cranky after work (not often, once every few months), I suggest he have a drink and relax. He's always much happier after. He has a lot of anxiety.

So this week we're both off work and at home with our 2 kids (6m and 3y) for the holidays. We had a lovely Christmas but I started feeling sick with a cold yesterday and was pretty sick most of today. The baby was congested, too. He was awesome and took care of the kids while I napped. I noticed he poured himself a drink, which I assumed was his first of the night. The baby was fussy so he went to put the baby to bed, relatively early then said he was turning in. He never goes to sleep this early unless he's drunk. He must have skipped dinner, too. He likely would have been smoking weed as well.

The baby fell asleep and I put the toddler to bed. I then took a shower and as I was finishing up, I heard the baby fussing on the monitor. I got dressed, put my hair in a towel, and the fussing stopped. I assumed the baby got himself to sleep but then I saw the baby's door was open and the baby was gone.

My husband had the baby in our room. The baby was wide awake and my husband was sleeping. He didn't wake up right away, but I took the baby and as I was walking out noticed he was drenched. It seemed a little weird, sometimes he saturates his diaper by morning but not when he's first put to bed. And it is never _that _ wet. His onesie was sopping. 

I take the baby to his room and I see the pack and play with standing puddles of urine. Babies do not make this much pee. I'm confused but I continue to change the now shivering baby. I get to the diaper, and the diaper is basically dry. No pee on the edges, it's sealed perfectly so it didn't leak. So it starts to dawn on me that the baby didn't pee on himself. The baby was spitting up more than usual today, but then I checked and it was definitely urine.

So I'm standing there wondering what's going on and I see a trail of pee tapering off toward the edge of the pack and play. I feel the side of the crib, at the top edge, and it was wet. The only explanation I can think of is that my drunk husband peed on the baby. I would love if there were another explanation, but I can't think of one. Even if it weren't for the urine, the fact that he had the baby in bed while he was passed out and barely responsive was totally unacceptable.

I go into my bedroom turn on the lights, my husband doesn't wake up, and I ask if he peed on the baby (I wouldn't expect him to remember if he did) and he just didn't register my presence at all. 

So, I filmed the crib with my description and I'll show him in the morning. I'll tell him again that he needs to see a doctor about sleepwalking. But how do I deal with the drinking? I don't have people I feel like I can talk to about this. My family is terrible. I'm reluctant to approach his family because I don't want to cause a rift, but a couple of them have been in AA and NA and would understand.

At the time of writing this, I’ve basically lost everything. I have almost no family to speak to, no friends, no coworkers. I’m essentially out of money, but I have food to eat, so its not so bad.

Its me and my cat, Oatmeal. At least he likes me.

The past 6 or 7 years have been mostly downhill for me. And I have no one to blame but myself. I have ruined and lost countless relationships and friendships, gained lots of money and lost lots of money. A lot of this has to do with alcohol and addiction. But like I said, I have no one to blame but myself.

I used to be a person who almost thought you couldn’t even really be addicted to things, besides maybe like meth and heroin. But addiction is a very real thing.

Honestly, I’m not sure why I started writing this tonight, but I think I’ve officially hit my rock bottom. Maybe one day I can help someone in a similar situation.

I sat down a few minutes ago and wrote in a journal, its something that I always tell myself I’m going to do but never actually do it. I did it because who else will listen? And after writing a few pages to myself, I thought maybe all of this actually happened for a reason.

Lately I’ve been trying to think about the idea of turning adversity into success. Maybe this is the right time. I don’t have a plan, I don’t know where I’ll go from here, but when you hit the bottom the only place you can go is up.

I suppose this is the start of an alcohol-free journey, I’m on day 2. I know there’s a long road ahead, as I need to also quit cigarettes. But here we go.

Also, I apologize to anyone reading this because I know its a little all over the place. There probably won’t be any structure, its just something that I want to get off of my chest.

So I guess the reality is I’m here because I’ve been a huge asshole to everyone around me for a very long time. A lot of them got away from me, and I could never be mad about that now that I’m looking back. I’ve been a terrible person to be around, so I consider them lucky.

I think I’ll start writing more about my experiences, about addiction, stuff like that. With time I hope to improve my life. And hopefully someone might read these things that could use some help. I know we all need that sort of thing sometimes.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5771271}"

My weight has gone up significantly, and so has my tolerance. 
My husband is fed up with my drinking and gave me an ultimatum.

I quit drinking cold turkey, and am on day 2.
All morning long, my heart has been racing, and my hands have a mild tremor.
I have the worst anxiety and feel like I am losing my mind. 
I still have an appetite, and have not been nauseous or vomiting. 

I’m not sure if it is all in my head, or what.
But as the day progressed, I felt worse and worse and thought I was going to have a panic attack. 
I was able to make Christmas breakfast for my kids and watch them open their presents. 

But when we were on our way to my in-laws, I had us stop at a drugstore to get a last minute gift for my father in law. 
My husband and kids stayed in the car.. 
I then also bought a few tiny boxes of wine and shoved them in my purse. 

I drank them all, and almost immediately felt better and no longer felt as crappy as I did earlier. 
I did not get drunk at all, and had a mild buzz that wore off fast. 
I of course told no one, and am terrified.
My husband said that if I drink without telling him, he will be furious. 
But then, when this happens he gets mad at me: so naturally I kept this in secrecy. 

I don’t want to drink anymore, but do not have the time nor the means to do inpatient detox. 
I have to work and take care of my kids. 
I don’t have any family to help out, and my in-laws hate me as it is. 

How do I go about doing an at home detox?
When I tried it in the past, I was always yelled at and told to go to the hospital. 
This is not an option for me, and I am so lost and have no direction.

Could someone please help me?

She had been doing so good with her drinking (for the most part) ever since I blew up at her this one time. And every time I come home, it seems like she makes sure to not get drunk in front of me. 

Until today, she was literally incoherent as my family and I went to bed after our Christmas family party. 

The worst part is, I was making excuses for her this time, saying to myself it’s okay that she got drunk because it’s Christmas, it’s a holiday. But it just turned out to have a sad undertone in my head.

No one else got as drunk as her, she was slurring words as I’m trying to enjoy time with my family before I go back to my apartment, and now I’m fearing a new cycle of slipping up coming, something I won’t be able to monitor which means it falls on my other siblings who still live at home. 

It’s taking me back to 2020 when she would be shitfaced nearly every day, hiding bottles and shit from us, etc. I don’t know what to do, and the worst part is, I think she knows that and so she takes it as an excuse to keep on doing it, even if it is mentally tearing me apart and ruining my image of ‘home’.

This Christmas i am literally alone. my roommate and best friend went to visit their family, so i was alone in the house all day yesterday and today. i’ve been drunk and/or high most of this time. i’m sober now and all i can thinking about is taking shots.

my parents are coming to visit me starting tomorrow, so i can’t bitch and whine all that much. 

anyway, the gist is I constantly feel lonely and drinking is how i’m dealing with that. I keep trying to find a reason to stop, but i can’t justify any of them. i’m a bit worried it’s gonna take hitting rock bottom for me to commit to being sober. another part of me is holding out hope that maybe i won’t ever have to cut alcohol out of my life completely, and that maybe i’ll be able to consume in moderation (this has no logic to it since i’ve never been able to moderate before). another part of me is so comfortable in my alcoholism. another part of me is so ashamed of my dependence.

I woke up (came to) sometime in the morning. For a few moments in my alcohol induced fog, I thought I was home. I was thinking I hope the kids stay in bed a while longer before we have to do presents and visit the families. I opened my eyes and looked up at the rafters in the attic. Then at the army cot I was in. It all came crashing down on me. I remember I cried a little bit, then I grabbed the vodka bottle which I always kept next to me. I took a few pulls, laid back in my cot, folded my arms across my chest and pretended I was in a casket. I was pretending people were walking by, saying how I looked good and wishing they were nicer to me when I was alive. That didn't stop my drinking.

I am not sure whether this is the right subreddit to post in but I don't know where to seek advice. So, my boyfriend has very long history of alcoholism which has lead him to gain huge debt, change workplaces and so on. We have been together for two months and he has been nothing but sweet and loving. He stopped drinking when we became official and he didn't drink for the first month or so. However, things with his debts became quite serious but he managed to gain some money gambling, which is another addiction of his so he is able to recover from the debt. He started drinking last week, after a couple of days he told me and I came to visit, he went through the whole abstinence shit and was sober, however when I left he started drinking again which was for one night. Which leads us to today-Christmas. We went out and he suggested drinking and was quite adamant about it(I rarely drink alcohol) but he said hey it's Christmas today is my day so on, we drank at a bar and at one point he was drunk, I don't know how I managed to take him home, he wasn't able to walk proper, fell a couple of times. When we went home he went to sleep, he woke up a couple of times and the last one he wasn't drunk anymore. I thought that was it... I did make diner, bought a Christmas tree so he can have a normal holiday since I don't know when. He started asking me about alcohol again and became a bit angry when I wasn't okay with him drinking so I went and bought some. He doesn't behave like that normally. We have been talking about serious stuff about the future, how he wants to change and shit but he has told me he loves alcohol and doesn't want to stop drinking...
He is a very heavy drinker, drinks beer tons of it, it takes him 4 litres to feel the effect of the alcohol, he sees no problem in going drunk to work, he has been in a psychiatric hospital in order to stop drinking apparently to no result. 
He has been saying he does want to overcome this and he says he understands the damage it has done but his words are not in accordance with his actions that's what's bothering me. 
I want to ask is there a way he can keep his addiction at bay by going out and having a couple of drinks with me occasionally, this is something I came up with but idk whether it's doable. I love him and I want to help him but I can't stand this, he just becomes a different person when he drinks and looks like he doesn't give a fuck about me, even though he told me loves me more than alcohol. I want to support him and I have been giving everything since we are together but I am not sure whether he wants to stop and I feel lost and clueless about what to do.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45011067}"

A couple of years ago, my boyfriend (41) would drink a 12 pack of Magic Hat on Friday and Saturday nights. It was almost ritualistic; he'd finish one, rinse out the bottle, open the fridge, get another one, sit back down. Automatic. I started to speak up and mention that it's a lot. I was essentially told to mind my own business.

The last year or so, he's been drinking a six pack of Lagunitas L'il Sumpin on the weekends and a few nights a week. Same automatic response- once one is gone, up to get another. 

I've told him I'm alarmed that he isn't exercising any self-control- like I've never seen him have just 3. He has to finish the pack. He tells me it's fine.

Unfortunately, we're hosting Christmas.

We went to the liquor store and he picked up a 12 pack of Winter Warmers- in addition to Lagunitas- saying the WW was ""for the guests"".
I watched him drink the 12 pack one by one while watching Christmas movies last night and got so bummed out that I just went to bed.

I dread going downstairs after I post this. I bought myself some beer, and I'm afraid that that, too, will have been decimated.

Please tell me how concerned I should be with this behavior- the ritual, the lack of self control, the lying. He used to be a smoker; I don't know if that means anything.

It's crushing to watch him do this to himself. He's gained weight, he's ""poopy"" the next day and just wants to nap...more alarmingly he won't listen to my concerns, and he has stopped going to the doctor. My guess is he doesn't want to be told that he's damaging his body and needs to stop drinking.

that was the day i stopped because i couldn’t drink anymore. my body rejected it. so i didn’t drink for quite awhile, have slipped in and out of moderate alcohol use in that time. until recently when it became a problem again, after a breakup and bad depressive episode. 

last night was my last drink. i had a couple shots and the same thing happened — i felt extremely ill which was not normal for the amount i drank. i didn’t puke and luckily my withdrawals are nowhere NEAR what happened a year ago, that was terrifying. and this bender has only been a couple weeks long. 

this is more of an accountability ramble than anything, but i am super curious as to why this has happened to me… after weeks or months of drinking a ton and never being sick, why do i randomly get very ill from a couple shots all the sudden? this has now happened twice and i can’t find why.

I hope you can help me

Basically my partner has alcoholic tendencies and I’ve worked really hard to help guide her away from her family’s history with alcohol (with her consent). It seems everyone on her mums side likes to drink to excess, someone in her family has been to hospital because of kidney/liver complications because of their alcoholism. It’s a family thing that I reserve my opinion on unless it’s brought inside my 4 walls (being a fitness professional, I advocate a healthy lifestyle). I’ve spoke to my partner about my concerns and she’s completely on board with not wanting to drink to excess, she just lacks self control when her peers pressure her into a solid impromptu session on the sauce. 

Let’s frame the situation at hand that led me here tonight: Being Christmas Eve I have had a few to drink myself, only 4 drinks of single rum mixer and a glass of bubbly, but I know I’ve hit my limit. We’ve got a puppy who needs a regular sleep pattern (22h latest bedtime, up at 08:30) and don’t want to disturb him. 

My mother in law will drink to excess until 3am regularly at her home. She’s in her late 50s and in my opinion there isn’t anyone changing her opinion on her relationship with alcohol. Even her husband is T total (also gone to bed early) but she continues to drink, you’d think that his actions would have some influence…  she literally finds ANY excuse to drink enough to put a horse under.

Anyway, my partner has been struggling with keeping off it, but to her merit, has succeeded in kicking a potentially bad habit together. She’s got a high stress job so I get why she does it. But because her mums round and they’re the remaining people awake, I know she’s going to drink and drink  at her mothers pace. Much like other people, I don’t find it particularly pleasant to be in close proximity to a drunk person when trying to sleep (for all the reasons). 

I tried suggesting we leave the puppy alone tonight and make the open bubbly the last bottle so he can sleep. He’s only in the next room and the walls / doors are very thin. The mum ignored my suggestion and popped a fresh bottle. As a reaction to that, I said “ok, I know my limit and now I’m going to bed” poured my *fresh* glass back in the 2nd bottle that she just poured to assert my position on any more consumption. My partner scorned me for it ??
I ignored and went to bed. 

I guess my problem is that the mother in law has brought her alcoholic tendencies inside my 4 walls, I’ve gone to bed because I can’t tolerate the behaviour and relationship towards alcohol, and now I’m uncomfortable how my partner is up with her mum pursuing the same levels of alcohol with her mum. I’m asking for help here, it’s really tricky to navigate for me. I don’t like using direct approaches because I fear I’ll come across as a dick. Could you folk suggest anything that will help soften the anxiety I’m facing ?

He did finally break whatever hallucination state he was in.  It was fascinating because he was in and out of fitful sleep with these visions or sounds leading him to believe something was there when it wasn’t, but I knew he was coming out of it when his sleep became quieter and more peaceful… less aggressive snoring turned into soft and heavy breaths instead.  It was bizarre to watch the whole thing.  I finally slept from about 5-7 when he woke up with a “good morning, my love” and immediately followed by “oh god, what happened? What did I do?” when he saw my reaction.  Even after telling him everything that has transpired, he started in on committing to take a “long break” from drinking and I asked him what exactly it was going to take to wake him the f*#£ up? What’s the bottom here? His kids have seen this, we’ve fought physically while he was out of it and trying to do crazy things, I’ve called the police on him, I’ve picked him up from hotel hallway floors when he sulked off and for wasted, and now we’re waking up in his soiled sheets… as I said, we’ve been in some hairy spots since he started drinking again. Some really ugly stuff.  I asked him if getting so drunk that you wake up unable to remember how you’ve hurt your family this time is really worth it?  Because that’s ALL that ever happens.  He cannot drink normally, and that’s it.  I told him I wouldn’t be able to keep the kids here under these circumstances because it’s just not fair to them.  Until recently they had a stone-cold-sober dad who is an incredible business man, mentor, and partner.  And now they’ve had that taken away… for what?  Finally he committed to not drinking again.  He seemed sad to give it up, like he was losing something, but when I asked what he gets from it,
he didn’t have an answer. In fact, he acknowledged there was absolutely nothing positive to gain from alcohol at all. He asked me to hold him when he gets anxious and to be patient with him if he gets irritable, but that his family and his health is more important.  He’s officially made it one day, so we will see.  Doctors appointment and AA meeting is coming next, along with the Naltrexone shot. 

As Sod’s law would have it, yesterday I took him for a (pre-booked) massage to relax the both of us and the first thing the staff offered (at 9am) was a glass of champagne (ugh) and then a massive box showed up at our house containing our monthly wine subscription (now canceled).  Thankfully we diverted from the champagne and I put the wine in the garage to donate to some responsible party somewhere else today. 

Wish us luck. I’m sure this won’t be a straight forward line but god, it was so nice to see my sober husband all day and all night.  I hope we get him back more and more.

My husband was 13 years sober and relapsed when the pandemic began. Since then he’s been convinced he can “moderate” and he’s been 100% unsuccessful.  Over the last nearly two years of this, I’ve been in some very hairy situations with him when he blacks out. At least, I think that’s what happens.  It’s like my husband is gone. His eyes are dark and glassed over, he speaks differently, he’s pretty belligerent which is miles from his sober, ridiculously mushy and sweet self.  He’s generally a big teddy bear, and then alcohol turns him into someone I can’t stand to be around. 

Tonight he drank scotch, vodka and wine and eventually stumbled to bed.  I stayed up and some hours later heard him yelling from the bedroom so I checked on him.  He had wet the bed, fully clothed, and although mostly still asleep or out of it, keeps randomly waking, shouting, thinking objects are other things (he thinks his charging dock IS his phone and will wake up and mess with it a bit and go back to passed out). I changed as much of the bed sheets as I could and got him undressed but he was not happy with me, and insisted I am preventing him from doing what he wants… not sure what he wants.  He is in and out of sleep and keeps abruptly waking.  At one point he got up because he thought someone was at the door (it’s 3am) and he needed to go downstairs. I obviously don’t feel comfortable allowing him near the stairs so I stopped him and he got irritated with me.  At the moment I’m laying here next to him - the bed smells bad, as does he. I’m just trying to placate him every time he pops up so he doesn’t try to leave and get himself hurt. He’s fallen before in this state. 

He keeps thinking he has something in his hands like “a salad”. Is he hallucinating?  Is there any way to pull him out of this faster? Food? 

I know the morning will bring him shame and guilt. He knows he has a problem, I just don’t know how exactly to get him back into sobriety.  This is miserable.",70,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51913226}"

December 27th is going to be 120 days.  I can't believe I've made it this far, it's been an insane struggle.  In my last post, I talked about feeling like I'd lost most of my friends, and that hasn't really changed, but one person has stuck with me through everything and that's been an insanely stable rock for me.

The holidays are going to be lonely, but I'm determined not to slip.  I went to a staff Christmas party this month that had alcohol at it.  My Boss was kind enough to check with me beforehand to make sure I'd be okay, and I was confident.  This was the first party I'd went to since I'd undertaken this road, and I didn't realize how much of a difference the lack of drinking was going to make.  Instead of being loud like I've been normally at these types of gatherings, I spent most of the evening quietly to myself.  I forgot how quiet and anxious I could get at gatherings like that, it felt so weird to spend most of it alone.  I actually worried I was offending people, I did have a good time though.  Food was good, there were laughs, and I enjoyed watching everyone else have fun more than anything.  I don't know, I guess maybe I forgot this was who I was.

&#x200B;

There was a moment where I was refilling up on Root Beer, and my coworker was getting vodka.  I caught a whiff of the open bottle and it just made me feel sick for a moment, which I'm leaning into as an extremely good sign that I can keep doing this.  

&#x200B;

I joined a discord for AA meetings, which has made it easier to get in touch with people who's struggles are a bit more similar to mine.  The meetings I went to in town had nice people, but now that I'm engrained with these, it's easy to jump into a meeting nearly whenever I want, since there are so many that run on a daily basis.  Anyone who's browsing this board, I highly recommend you look into the zoom/discord meetings with the new COVID restrictions coming around again.

I get told stories all the time the morning after about how I was incredibly lively and the nicest guy when I’m blacked out which makes me happy. Or people who only met me when I was drunk wanting to hang out with me when I’m sober then never trying to meet up again after because I’m too different. When I’m sober I’m very introverted and kind of gloomy, people have a hard time understanding my speech because I have a deep voice and I’m quiet and I just am not very funny. If I could just be who I am when I’m drunk all the time then I’d always be happy. I’m just concerned for my health so don’t really think I should be drinking like that anymore. Some examples being that I went to a party with a bunch of couples and kept telling them that they looked great together or that “he’s a keeper, such a good guy” and vice versa stuff like that. Or when I kept trying to tell another friend that was really drunk that he should lay down on the couch so he doesn’t hurt so much in the morning. That’s the me I always want to be but he never comes out until I’m like 10 shots deep so I find myself drinking most nights.

Looking back, I don’t think I’ve ever had a healthy relationship with alcohol. When my friends in university would know how to moderate, I would drink to excess, passing out, blacking out and even near hospitalization. 

When I started working, I started drinking 5/6 drinks every day to cope with how unfulfilling my corporate life is (if I wasn’t so scared or depressed, I would definitely pursue art).

So it’s been 3 years of straight drinking (minus 5 months of sobriety in between for weight loss) and the pandemic basically through me back into drinking every day and once bars started opening up, I kind of went off the deep end. 

My fiancé literally begged me to stop because he was worried about my health. My therapist said I had a problem and that alcohol was affecting all my relationships, and I denied it until 3 weeks ago. I gained all the weight I lost because of the drinking. I’m still kind of in denial about being an alcoholic and really want to be able to drink moderately. My wedding is next November and we are having an open bar. I feel immense disappointment that I might not be able to partake. 

Sorry for the ramble, but I’m really sad/afraid I won’t be able to drink again because I won’t be able to drink moderately like others…My mom doesn’t drink at all, but I don’t know my biological dad and whether alcoholism runs in his family. All I know is that my sister and I are the only ones who struggle with our relationship with alcohol. 

Wondering if anyone had the same fears when they first got sober? Need words of support that I’m doing the right thing.

This is part vent I guess, and a request for advice, I'm sorry it's a long read.

I've known for more than two decades my friend is an alcoholic, but any time I've tried to bring it up I've been met with denial, excuses or anger.

After all they can work and they don't always drink every day etc... I'm sure many of you know of the usual excuses people make to avoid the truth.

They've never once admitted to being an alcoholic in all that time, until recently.

A couple of weeks ago they admitted they're a high functioning alcoholic, then qualified that as semi, and then barely functioning.

I told them I've always known, and I'll be there to help.

And I mean it, I would have walked away decades ago if I didn't care, as the effects of their alcohol fuelled behaviour has harmed me many times in the past.

Watching them self destruct for decades has also been painful, I've felt helpless to do much given their ongoing strong denial of their alcoholism.

They're much smarter than me so it's been difficult to come up with arguments that stand up to their denialism.

Their usual drinking session on at least several nights a week is a six pack of full strength cider often with an additional small flask of brandy.

They have been doing that for many years.

It's not unusual for them to feel they're still too drunk the next day to drive at least once a weekend.

They usually only buy six packs of cider because they're unable to control the urge to keep drinking if they buy larger quantities.

I recently helped them to clean up the empty bottles from around their house and there were hundreds of empties.

They're currently struggling with burnout from their work, and what I would consider to be severe long term depression, and drinking to numb the pain.

They'll have to move in the near future as the house they're in is uninhabitable, due to water damage and many years of lack of repairs by the landlord.

That's not helped as they've been drinking a bit also to numb their despair at being stuck living in a dump of a house.

They really have nowhere else to go now, and being homeless would make it nearly impossible for them to maintain their employment.

They don't have any other close friends and no family here, and their only other good friends live interstate.

I can't let them and their dog end up homeless, I care about them too much to let that happen, and think they would almost certainly commit suicide if that happened.

So they're planning to move into my spare room until they're on their feet a bit more, which I offered to them.

But that's going to mean I'm taking into my small house the impacts of their alcohol and smoking addictions.

I'm a long time ex drinker since after a brain injury in 1999 when drinking alcohol started to give me hives, and I find the smell of alcohol and being around drinkers unpleasant.

I'm also an ex smoker after over 3 decades of heavy addiction, and am very sensitive to and hate the smell, it's not something I would ever start doing again.

I know I can't expect my friend to just instantly stop these long term addictions when they're not currently showing any signs of being willing to.

So I've told them they can only smoke outside away from the house, and only drink in their room or outside, to minimise the impact on me.

They've agreed to do so but I'm sure it won't be easy for them.

I'm hoping those limitations will at least maybe help them cut back. That might improve their finances, as they've drunk and smoked themselves into a lot of debt.

I've explained that there will also be a lot of limitations on them making noise, because of my need for rest due to my being permanently chronically ill.

I've lived alone with my dogs and cat for the most part of the past two decades, so it will be challenging to adjust to another person and dog in my space.

I expect it will negatively impact me mentally and physically to some degree, I have a neuromuscular disorder that's made worse by stress.

I want to help them address their alcohol use disorder now they've shown they have some insight and accept there's a problem.

They're quite fragile at the moment and I think probably only at the ""accepted there's a problem"" stage. 

So I don't want to push too hard and have them become resistant to change, I have read that's potentially counterproductive.

They're already discussing (with a friend interstate who also drinks) drinking vodka instead of their usual cider and brandy, to reduce the alcohol smell for my sake.

But I'm a bit concerned it could just become a way for them to hide the true level of their alcohol consumption and maybe get worse.

What should I be wary of to avoid enabling their addiction, and how can I support them without being pushy?

They're unlikely in the short term to be keen on things like AA due to them being atheist, but I want to encourage them towards getting some kind of help.

I've done some reading of the sub and linked resources, but could use some advice from people with experience and perspectives of alcoholism, I am feeling a bit worried and directionless as I've never dealt with anything like this before.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63909125}"

He'd hinted, casually, about being an ""alcoholic"" before. Unlike most, I didn't laugh and shrug it off. I know how comments like those come from dark places and saying them humorously is an insidious disguise for a very real issue. I do it myself, and, being in medical school and pursuing a career in psychiatry teaches you to read between the lines. 

I planned to gauge how serious the drinking was the next time he nonchalantly referenced his alcoholism and started keeping mental notes about how often he would tell me he'd been drinking (it's a little long distance, so he doesn't drink around me much). If I remember correctly, he's had a drink every night since he left my house last weekend, and at least half the days in the week before. I started to get worried and decided I would talk to him next time I saw him in person, but tonight he texted me so drunk he had vomited several times already. 

I told him I was concerned with the frequency of his drinking. He said I should be.

I asked him if we wanted to cut down on drinking and he said ""right now yes"". I know his answer could change. I asked him if I should ask him tomorrow when he's sober. He expressed the fear he'd felt thinking he'd given himself alcohol poisoning and how miserable he was. ""I don't even enjoy this"" He finished. My heart broke a little. 

I replied that it sounds like I don't need to ask again (I know he could still change his mind). I asked what he needed to help him stop drinking. The last thing he sent me was ""A lot"". I encouraged him to tell me what he needed and was met with no response. I tried to give him a fair amount of time before telling him it was okay to not want to talk about it right now but that I needed to hear from him so I knew he was okay. Still nothing. 

After nearly an hour, knowing he could have already choked on his own vomit in his sleep, I called, but I expected it when it went to voicemail. I reluctantly found his roommate on Facebook and bluntly asked if he was with my boyfriend. I knew the roommate was partially responsible for this before he told he was sorry for getting my boyfriend too drunk and lol-ing that he had passed out and gone to sleep. I debated responding with the dagger of a paragraph in my head, to take the kill shot, but thought better of it and left him on read.

I haven't slept. It's 5am here. I can't stop the waves of sadness that keep crashing through me or the panicky despair surrounding the conversation I have to have with him today. I can't keep contained the overwhelming fear that I can't help him, that he can't help himself, that I might lose him. I can't get the imagery of him suffering scraped from the backs of my eyelids. 

I know the official equation of things to ask to determine his willingness and ability to stop and  the clinical responses I'm supposed to use so he feels safe and supported. But I feel so lost and out of my element. How do you talk to and support someone with something like this when they lie next to you in bed and kiss your forehead instead of lying obediently on the exam table? I don't know how to do this. I don't know if I have the emotional capacity to be a rock for him; I already feel fragile and broken. I don't know if I am enough.

Backstory, my dad started drinking age 16 and 90% of my childhood he was drunk or in jail (usually got arrested for something alc related). He was the type of drunk who would stay in his room all day and only come out for food and more alcohol. I remember times sitting in his room crying begging him to stop drinking. He’d cry with me while i begged. He had visited multiple rehabs and gotten detoxed at the hospital plenty of times but he’d only stay sober for 8months max before falling back to alcohol. 

This happened while i was on a trip out of town with friends and family, only a few days after Christmas 2018. Holidays were always hard for him and around Thanksgiving is when he’d usually get in one of his drinking phases. These phases could last for months when he’d have little contact with the family and mainly stay in his room, not working. 

It was around 2-3 A.M. when he left the house and went to a 711 nearby to buy more booze. I guess he was causing commotion or something cause the clerk called for an ambulance and an officer(don’t forget the clerk called for an ambulance as well!). An officer showed up, cancelled the ambulance, and took him to a holding cell in the sheriffs office. 

He stayed in holding cell until about 7am. Either no one was watching him or they just didn’t care enough(I say this because our family still has an ongoing court case that’s going nowhere and they won’t show anyone the tapes from the cell). He went into cardiac arrest and wasn’t breathing for around 9 minutes, was “rushed” to the hospital, and pronounced brain dead. From what i remember, the people who did the autopsy told me it had to do with his salt-salinity levels in his body(i could be wrong). All of new year’s eve and new years we were in the hospital with him talking about how we would let him go. My stomach dropped seeing my dad who was so full of life and energy(when he was sober at least) laying in that hospital bed, not even able to breath by himself anymore. If the officer hadn’t cancelled the ambulance, and brought him in for a detox, or if someone was watching him closer, i like to think would’ve made it. 1/2/2019 around 5am, my father only age 38 passed away. 

Holidays can be hard for everyone. Especially those are struggling with addiction. No matter the case, anyone on here who’s having a hard time this holiday, i send my best wishes out to you<3",92,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.632153}"

I keep thinking about how I committed essentially domestic violence. We are no longer together, a mutual agreement. I need to work on myself and he (and NO ONE) deserves to be treated that way. The guilt is near unbearable. I take full responsibility and know I need to make some serious changes. I will be embracing sobriety, although I don’t depend on alcohol, I refuse to continue to consume something that has shown me time and time again that I turn into someone I don’t like, harming my loved ones.

2021-12-21 18:07:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/rlqpub/blacking_out/,Blacking Out,"Hello. Turning to Reddit with one of my deepest personal flaws as usual. I’m a 21 year old college student. I started drinking when I was in the 8th grade, but like most people, the volume that I drink now is much more than when I first started. My alcohol consumption in high school was pretty innocent stuff, and I didn’t start drinking heavily until I got to college. Since I’ve been in college, I’ve experienced countless black outs. The vast majority of them didn’t result in anything serious, however I did go to the hospital one time after falling and hitting my head. Some friends have also told me that I can get quite emotional when I black out, specifically regarding the passing of my older brother a couple of years ago. Most recently, I blacked out at a tailgate while my family was present, which I am very embarrassed of. I don’t want to give them any reason to worry about me, and I definitely did that day. 

I don’t want to black out; I never intend to do it. I’ve talked to my therapist and many other people about this issue. Most of the feedback I hear is “just don’t do it then.” Well, yeah, no shit - for me it isn’t that easy. Or it’s other tips like “count your drinks” or “mix in glasses of water throughout the night.” These are all great ideas on paper, but they rarely work for me. I’m fully capable of understanding why blacking out is dangerous when I’m sober, but once I start drinking, all of the advice I’ve been given goes right out the window. I either get nervous or excited about the situation I’m in, and the drinks start flowing. It’s so frustrating because I want to change and it sounds so easy, but everyone once in a while I slip up again and black out, and I feel so ashamed in myself. I want to be able to drink in moderation, but sometimes it seems like I am powerless to alcohol.

I haven't touched alcohol, like hard liquor, in 3 years and I'm really proud of that but recently I've been hanging with my university friends and they drink when we're together. I obviously don't but sometimes I drink a couple beers with them, more cause I like the taste than anything else, really. They don't get me tipsy or anything and I feel in control, they also know about my history so I've instructed them to stop me or check on me if I start acting weird, which I don't because I've never reached that point again. I feel like a fraud, tho, I feel like because of my past I can't really enjoy beer anymore, I feel like I'm breaking a rule or something. Do you think is possible to be stable and sober yet enjoy a casual beer without relapsing? Am I doomed to not drink anything else again forever just in case I might relapse? Sometimes I really wish I could feel normal and drinking beer does that to me, I stop feeling like the alcoholic friend, the one who's got to always stay alert, the one who gets triggered by the smell of hands sanitizer and I feel like a regular 20 years old dude with his friends at a bar",36,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50037485}"
2021-12-21 13:26:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/rlktte/my_father_died_of_alcoholism_10_years_ago_today/,My father died of alcoholism 10 years ago today at the age of 54,"Hey guys. I’m posting today on my dad’s death anniversary to try to encourage those struggling to get help. It’s never too late to turn it around, especially if you have kids. My father died when I was 23 years old of liver failure/cirrhosis. I loved my father and always will but he was a flawed man. He was an alcoholic since his college days at Penn State before I was born and I had never known my father sober. My dad was a typical high functioning drunk for most of his life. He was white collar and worked for IBM for 25 years after graduating at PSU. IBM had a restaurant/bar on the ground floor of their office tower and he would stop there everyday after work and come home hammered. That was until he got progressively more important within the corporation and eventually could just work remotely from a home office. When that happened and he no longer had to dress up for work and look presentable his alcoholism accelerated. All my memories of my dad from childhood and young adulthood were of him drunk with a few moments of him sober sprinkled in between which I always cherished. 

My childhood & life experience is very similar to others that have grown up with alcoholic parents. My parents divorced because of my dad’s alcoholism when I was 7. I witnessed horrible domestic violence at a young age and was made to grow up quick. I was tasked as the man of the house at 7 years old when my dad gave me a $100 and told me I had to look after my mom and sister. He then left to move across country with a much younger woman who was my father’s mistress when he was married to my mom. My dad didn’t ever want to be a father figure to me. He wanted to be my best friend. Due to this he treated me very inappropriately & at a very young age (under 10) would openly ask me to rate his mistresses as a young boy and brag about their breast and other features while still being married to mother. He embarrassed me in front of friends and school trips drunk countless times. He racked up numerous DUI’s and was one of the first to have the brand new ignition interlock technology back in 2002. 

It seemed my father’s main wish in life was for me to be his drinking buddy when I turned 21. But that was never going to happen as I was so disgusted by alcoholism growing up I swore it off at a young age. We had the classic alcoholic reversal of roles between parent & child; I was the parent and he was the child. He retired from IBM in 2008 and the rest of his life collapsed the little bit that was left to fall. By December 2011 he was delirious and confused so he was taken to the ER where he learn he was in end stage liver failure with weeks to live and naturally not a transplant candidate as he wouldn’t even survive the sobriety window required to get on the transplant list. My dad lived 4 weeks after that ER diagnosis. What I witnessed in those 4 weeks to his health and body was horrific. He never drank again after that day but it didn’t matter. It was too late. He spent his last 4 weeks of his life in denial of his impending fate when he was actually lucid enough to have coherent thoughts. As a final devastating blow he refused to see his children or take our calls. I don’t know why but I suspect it was guilt. It’s been 10 years since then. My father left 5 children behind with 2 ex wives. The youngest being 5 and I was the oldest at 23. 

Please don’t share my father’s fate. You have a chance to turn it around everyday above ground. Don’t continue scarring your children. No matter what they say they see and know what’s going on and it will have a devastating effect on their entire lives. I wish you all health & happiness.",90,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6898011}"

During recent times my alcohol consumption has become more regular and more regular. I love a little one or two day bender. I guess around a year ago it was starting to hurt my relationship and it took for my partner to have a deep talk with me about my abuse of alcohol. At the time I took all of this news on board and everything was working well.

Fast forward a few months and I've fallen back down into my rabbit hole of drinking. If I drink mid-strength beers and no spirits I *feel* like I am in control and can stop drinking and be home by an reasonable hour. It is once I get on a roll though I get to a stage when I haven't got an off button and it has got to me as well. I don't want to be that person who loses my partner (who is now pregnant) due to excessive drinking.

At no stage has there been abuse of my partner, it is always the fact that I can't come home with her and spend time with her. I love her to bits.

I am really looking to hear some advice from you guys - at this point in my life I am not looking to give up alcohol directly. I want help how to know how to wean myself into learning when I have had enough. 

Thanks in advance.

I grew up in a South American household with bbq’s every weekend with everyone 16 and up drinking wine and beer. It was never a thing that was abused by me or my immediate family. Had a extended family member who was a belligerent drunk who ran his family into poverty. Growing up that became my benchmark of alcoholism. 

When I would drink, it was very casual however once a blue moon I would get extremely drunk which would be my reminder of why I don’t drink heavily. When I graduated college, I ended up at a big 4 accounting firm working 80 hours a week and on a team that enjoyed drinking. I started to travel a ton for work which lead to more consumption from which I started drinking daily when I was home. I couldn’t sleep unless I had wine or whiskey. I quit that job last year and landed at a really great company but have had a ton of life changes that have been pretty stressful and found my self drinking 3 to 4 bottles of beer or glasses of wine a night. I stopped going to the gym and put on a ton of weight. 

I’ve struggled with the idea that I may be an alcoholic and it scares me so much. I don’t want to be a failure which only adds to the stress and then I spiral. Had my company holiday party a couple weeks ago and drank too much and knowingly drove home. I live in a pretty rural area so there was no cars on the road when I drove home but still no excuse. The next day I kept thinking how stupid I was and realized that I have a problem. I haven’t had a drink since then because I keep thinking what could have happened.

I started dating this guy in august, so we’ve not been together too long. He’s an ultramarathon runner (runs 50+ mile races)… when sober. We are both very adventurous and love getting out in nature. But he’s also an alcoholic and has been binging for the past 5 days-the first I’m seeing this side of him. I’ve never been involved with an alcoholic, so this is new territory for me. Last night he asked me to come over and stay with him and help him. So I went and with his knowledge at his request I emptied all the alcohol in his house down the drain. About 3 hours later he insisted on going to the store to get more alcohol-he said he was drunk at a level 10 when I got there and asked in a scale how drunk he was. I tried to stop him by not letting him get to his wallet. This escalated and he told me that me trying to control him was making him mad (all I did was try to prevent him from getting his wallet, nothing else) and that he no longer wants to be with me and he literally said he chooses alcohol over me. So I left, hurt and angry,  and told him not to contact me again. I didn’t mean it but in the moment I was so frustrated and confused and hurt and sad. I’ve messaged him and apologized.  I know him saying those things was the alcoholism talking. But I’m unsure what to do. He’s got notifications silenced on his phone, not sure if he went and got more alcohol last night or if he’s drinking today-he’s got to be the one to make the decision to stop. He’s missed work today because of this. He drinks a fifth or two of vodka and-6-8 beers daily right now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5645393}"

We travel a lot together, most of which includes bar hopping everywhere we go. In fact our relationship started off with us mostly just meeting up to drink and watch movies in bed. Besides that though, I’m the one with a family history of alcoholism with nearly every adult on either side of my family having varying levels drinking problems. 

My girlfriend’s family on the other hand rarely drinks and are often self righteous about the amount that they do drink and will make offhand remarks whenever someone drinks more than the amount they deem appropriate (not only talking about me). So when my girlfriend sees or hears that my family is at happy hour for drinks and appetizers she gets noticeably annoyed and when arguing about my drinking will throw it in my face that “[I] never see [her] family ordering drinks with dinner” or that they only have a drink on special occasions. All this, disregarding the fact that she also wants a boyfriend who will take her out with her friends to hang out at bars or go to parties. 

I’m around my parents fairly often and they’ve even noticed a difference since I’ve started dating her. This past weekend I was driving my girlfriend back to her car from a bar with a slight buzz. I decided that wasn’t good enough so I had her grab a whiskey bottle from the backseat. I drank almost half on the 30 minute drive back to her car. I dropped her off and planned to meet her at her house but at some point I stopped for a six pack, drank most of it, blacked out, then got lost. I woke my parents up at 3:45am to tell them I didn’t know where I was. They looked for me for 2 hours, frantically driving up and down the freeway thinking I was about to get hit by another car any minute. When they finally found me, my car was parked on the freeway shoulder inches away from the lane. My tire was blown out and my front bumper was halfway off. 

The next day they staged an intervention for me and I still can’t believe all that happened. I’m disgusted with myself and ashamed and don’t plan to leave the house other than for work or other necessities for quite a while so I can figure out what to do next. They spoke to me and my girlfriend and one thing that came up was that while they don’t blame her since I’m a grown man responsible for my own actions, they know I spend most of my time with her and suggested that her actions enable me. Her wanting to go out and her compulsion to always be moving usually does involve drinking. Most of her side of the intervention was only her concern for herself and how she’s perceived in the situation. Later on she told me how frustrating it is that she’s being “blamed” for my alcoholism when it’s my family that’s “always going out for drinks” and her family never goes out for drinks[!]. 

She continuously expresses concern for my wellbeing then negates it by making more plans for the next weekend, then suggesting I have a “3 drink limit” or something similar. I tell her that’s not how I like to drink, I won’t feel a thing from 3 drinks or even 4 and I’d rather just stay home and not drink at all. She gets pissed when I decline these plans and I try to explain how miserable it is for me to remain sober in a social drinking situation. Rather than what I would see as support (i.e. staying home with me most times) she resentfully says that she’ll just go alone. I don’t expect her to always give up plans but I would find it more supportive and believe more that she cares if she would actually be there for me, at least for now as I try to regain my footing.

She’s no stranger to addiction and recovery as her ex was a drug addict. In fact she tends to be a know it all when it comes to these things and often times she’ll try to over explain to me how these things work. Still though it seems like she doesn’t really understand and wants to have her cake and eat it too (e.g. have a boyfriend who can keep up with drinking while traveling and partying but isn’t an alcoholic). Like I said, I’m going to take a break from everything for a while and figure it out. I just needed to vent and would like some outside opinions if anyone’s had experience with a non-alcoholic S.O. who impeded your recovery. Thank you.

*Tl;dr - Gf [25F] is more worried about how my [26M] family perceives her in relation to my alcoholism than she is about my health. She can be self-righteous when it comes to my family history vs. hers with regard to drinking. She loves to travel, hang out with friends at bars, and go to parties but gets upset when I tell her how hard it is to be sober in those situations.

My fiancé and I have been together for 10 years. We stopped drinking almost 4 years ago. His family has a host of mental/addiction/trauma that has not been dealt with.   
About 5 years ago, his mom borrowed my fiancé's truck. After side-swiping someone and breaking the side mirror, she was told to park the truck and not drive it again. Instead she took fiancé's younger brother and his gf to go pick up some drugs. On the way home, an argument ensued, brother grabbed the wheel and there was a head-on collision, resulting in the death of the driver, and his young son in the front seat had to have reconstructive facial surgery. At sentencing, his brother got several years in prison, where he is currently. 

His mom received probation and an alcohol monitoring system. For a while, it was an ankle bracelet and then it became a breathalyzer that randomly went off. While going through this process, it was the first time I had ever seen her sober. Our relationship improved significantly. She became much healthier, lost a lot of weight (she had gained alot back after her gastric bypass many years ago). She was so much more pleasant to be around. For 8 years or so, our relationship had been very tenuous, as I would often stoop to her insulting level when we got into arguments. She was doing SO GOOD sober. I had hopes it would last, even after she got off probation, but not as high as my fiancé. She drank the day she finished probation and the monitoring system. 

It's been a little over a year since then. She's back to looking very ill,  being very overweight which is continuing to affect her mobility. 

The issue: Fiancé revealed to me today he's been contemplating asking her to come live with us to try and get her sober again. Today was his birthday and he kinda let it all fly out to me at once, and so I haven't asked many questions yet as I've been absorbing the conversation, which felt full of alot of misdirected anger and pain. He mentioned it's ""what I preach"" all the time, wanting to help people quit drinking, but then when faced with someone he actually loves who needs help, I'm less enthused and not really ""walking the walk"". 

We have housed his brother two different times, each going very badly. I do want to help his mom quit drinking again, but I also know, people don't change unless they are ready. I also feel, she will just end up living in our tiny cabin with us forever. I don't want to be selfish but I also don't want our relationship to come to a similar breaking point as it has when his brother lived with us. His mom shows very little remorse regarding the accident, the father she took from his family, she hasn't worked a job in many years, and she can be very manipulative, and knowing my flawed, impatient, ADHD self, I know having her here with us will make things very difficult as I begin nursing school in January. 

I know this is scattered and long but there is so much history, it's hard to tell what is relevant to my question. so if anyone can offer any advice for the situation, I thank you endlessly. I want him to go to Al-Anon so he can understand that this guilt he holds is normal but not his responsibility (or is it?) but he is pretty antisocial so I don't see that happening.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44749683}"

We were finally able to get them out of the abusive/toxic environment by promising they can drink as much as they want while they’re living with us.

We’ve made multiple attempts to convince them to go to rehab or speak to an anonymous mental health line, but it’s not helping. All we are hearing is “tomorrow” which does not happen. 

A few questions: 

1. How to portion alcohol? How much to give and any strategies for gently reducing  the amount without alienating the relative. We don’t want them to leave to go back home because it looks like they get all the alcohol they want there. 

2. Anything we can say that’ll help them to reach out for help now and not “tomorrow”? There’s a big emotional baggage and it’s hard to navigate the conversations while they’re awake and somewhat lucid. 

We’ve reached out to multiple services, but all we are hearing is that there’s no help, unless the person themselves agrees to it. We are in Canada if that helps.

Last night I had my first sober night in many weeks, and I’ve NEVER gone more than 6 days without a drink in 16 years! 
I drink 300-450ml vodka or rum very nearly every night. I feel unwell every day and it’s completely ruined my body re severe IBS and lots of weakness and dizziness. I also have lots of crying and depression and anxiety. 
3 years ago I went a week without a drink and I felt well in my body but anxiety to the point of not coping so I had a drink. 

I haven’t had a DUI or embarrassed myself in public or lived in dirt or not showered or even eaten that badly in all those years. 
Heck I don’t even have alcoholic friends or go to the pub (I drink at home) and even my partner is 7 years sober! 
But I HAVE been very limited in being able to work, spending more time with daughter now late teens, being civil to my partner (oh the arguments!!) and generally pretty limited to lots of things in life. Missing out on lots etc. I’ve also not been there for my parents as much as they need me (both of whom have various illnesses now, and I really could have done more!) I’ve also missed out a lot on recent church stuff, which is also super important to me. 

I feel INCREDIBLY guilty for all this. Like I’ve totally wasted the last 15 years! 
I tried various jobs including high school teacher training in 2013. It wasn’t the drinking that stopped me completing it, and for some reason I obviously managed to not drink as much at all in that year. But the cause of that was bad mentors and an awful school …..

Anyway point is I haven’t specifically hurt anyone as such with actions - but perhaps not helped people as much as I should have done ….

My guilt is overbearing which means I am more likely to drink due to those feelings because I just think my life could have been so much better as a person if not for the drink.

Since being sober I have been staying with my parents (I detoxed there as well). Today my mom came over to help me completely clear out my room. She is so supportive and loving and I am so thankful for that. She and I cleaned my room top and to bottom and I was pretty disgusted with myself, then we took off my mattress cover and sheet. I almost threw up. This is what I have been sleeping on for the past 6 years. Years of peeing the bed (from being blacked out) and spilling alcohol on it.

So this past summer, I was drinking very heavily basically everyday. I would got through 6 shots plus easily every single day. It’s terrible, I know.

It felt as through the attack came in waves, I could not sleep at all that night, and was having auditory Hallucinations as well I believe. It felt like there were a thousand voices in my head all at once, it felt like I was forgetting who I was; it was terrifying and I wouldn’t wish that on anybody. After that panic attack, for the next week or so I was experiencing depersonalization/derealization. Those symptoms eventually faded, and now I sometimes experience drastic mood swings where I feel incredibly depressed and sad. I also have so much anxiety that I have never experienced before in my life. It’s been about a month since that panic attack and It feels as through my symptoms have been getting better as days pass. I would like to know; will I ever go back to feeling completely normal? Will the mood swings and anxiety ever completely disappear? I never felt this way before and it’s terrible. Have I messed myself up permanently? Given myself some kind of anxiety disorder? Is this paws? Keep in mind I never had anxiety in my life before. I’m not on any medications.

So me and my older sister have always been close…while my oldest brother fought cancer 4x she practically raised me and my other older brother who’s one year younger than her. She’s always cared for me in ways my parents never could or cared to. For a couple of years she was a parental figure for me i trusted her with every fiber of my being. I still trust her but i’m an adult now… sorta so it’s much more realistic than before. Anyways. Throughout the years we picked each other up when we fell her with alcohol me with drugs (pills coke weed). But i’m 19 now and have mostly stopped the craziness i barely smoke weed. While stoping wasn’t hard staying sober is. It’s not that i want to get high it’s that being sober means facing trauma, pent up emotions, and reality. I’m not saying i’m handling that well at all which is why i’m so empathetic when she comes home stumbling drunk crying and being handed off to me by my parents. I know the death grip wanting to be anywhere but your own fucking skull feels like i know why she drinks and why she can’t seem to stop. But fuck is it hard to sit by her at night and listen to her sob. i know all she’s been through and how many people have hurt her and it’s taking all of my will to not relapse because this devastating everlasting feeling of helplessness/uselessness is eating me alive. I know she needs me to be strong just as she was for me and me being in this position only makes my appreciation for her grow but it’s hard really hard seeing someone you love dearly suffer in a way you can’t fix i’ve hated feeling this way as a child and getting older and knowing that feeling never goes away…is hard not to be bitter about.

Went through two years of big lockdowns, recently moved cities and spent one lockdown alone for about three months, living alone in a city where I didn't know anyone, and this gave me far too much time to drink without shame, no one around me to raise their eyebrows. 

On average I probably will down four or five big gin and sodas or a bottle of wine 4-5 times a week. The problem is I don't drink because I'm depressed (I have depression but I'm on meds and it is largely under control). I just really like drinking. I find normal life boring, why would I watch a tv show sober when I know it's more fun to be a little buzzed? 

I'm not the kind of person who gets drunk and starts fights or gets into accidents or that kind of thing. If anything, no matter how drunk I am, I still come home and wash my face, brush my teeth and go to bed in PJs but I don't know how to talk to anyone about it because I'm surface level responsible so no one really seems concerned. I even brought it up with my psych and she kept saying, oh yeah but you're just coping. I don't know if it's because I'm a pretty articulate and smart person so no one is thinking I'm the typical down and out alcoholic whose life is falling to pieces but at the same time, I know this isn't normal or right. 

In my mind, being able to drink is a way to hack life, it's fun and funny to be able to get a buzz on or waste a few hours in the evening by drinking but I also am totally aware of the massive health risks/costs I'm affording myself. I think I feel like I won't be like this forever so it's okay to do this in my mid twenties and when I'm older I'll sort it out but I also know that's not how alcoholism works. I can absolutely have days where I don't drink but I'm at the point where as soon as I start, I can't stop. Or don't want to stop. What's the point of having one beer when you can have 6 or 7? 

I guess this is me reaching out to anyone in a similar situation. What's helped / how have you navigated this?

She didn't and I decided I needed some distance and packed my stuff and went to my house.
She took this as breaking up and isn't really speaking to me anymore.
During the time we were together I've seen her drink more and more each day, which made life with her really hard some days. In the end she drank wine every day, 3 or 4 days a week 3 bottles of wine or 2 bottles and half a bottle of whiskey.
She told me she needs to either drink or claw open her veins because of the way she feels which honestly shocked me.
As a ex addict, to drugs, I recognize the path she's on. I know that it's not going to lead to anywhere and she'll hit rock bottom at some point.

I am being monitored very closely by a psych, my pcp and a therapist.  To also give some context. I am Chicano male who grew up in a household where talking about mental health or your feelings is a no no no. Instead we should just keep quiet and drink to suppress that ""white people problems"" shit.

I went to the doctor and he told me my liver enzymes were just slightly  high and it was nothing to worry about if I quit drinking now. He said we could check in two months and more than likely the numbers would be back to normal range. I felt like this was a big wake up. I have stumbled since, but I consider 3 days in 15 days a victory from where I was. Side story aside, I'll get to the meat of my post's intent.

&#x200B;

I have been having strangely realistic dreams for the past few months. So realistic I couldn't remember later if they were a dream or real life. I could list several examples, but I hear the more you talk about dreams the more you'll have them and I don't want these dreams messing up my life lol. I had a job interview with a company recently and I felt like I hit a home run. I know that in real life (via my phone conversation history) I called him asking if he had made a decision. He told me to wait until after the new year until they interview a few more candidates. I was the only candidate they interviewed so far. Anyways, I dreamed the next day one of the people in charge of hiring wrote me an e-mail telling me they understood my urgency to want a job, but that they were going to wait until after the new year. I checked my e-mail later that day to respond and I could not find it. I checked all my e-mails, spam, trash, and archived folders and found nothing. None the less, I wrote the guy a response saying I couldn't find the e-mail but I appreciate him letting me know he would contact me after January. I know he said this in person as well, so I don't think it sabotaged me. Well, I just woke up from another dream that I ended up in the hospital for severe withdrawals, woke up in bed next to my wife and asked her if it was true, and she said ""Yes, this is the first day you've been home in 2 weeks"" Of course,  I wake up later and she pinches me and I've not been in the hospital for withdrawals for 2 weeks. One last example, at my last job I would dream I would schedule pickups and write them down in a book. Then when I reminded my employees about this scheduled arrangement they looked at me like I was crazy. That none such existed.

&#x200B;

That was probably more words than even the Biblbe would have wanted me to share. Has anyone else experienced realistic dreams indistinguishable from real life from alcohol withdrawal?

Never posted here before but I'm having a tough go at it recently and could really use some advice/help. Some background:  


My stepfather has been in my life forever now (28 currently, mom married him when I was 6). Dude's amazing. Funny, warmhearted, always quick to help. Well, alcohol (among other things) forced my mom and him to divorce. My older sister and I still have a really close relationship to him, and my Mom is ok with that, actually encourages it. Well, he got remarried to another woman, my sister and I don't like her, but we're nice to her and try to include her as much as we can, seeing as we want my stepfather to be in our life as much as possible.   


Well, about 6 months ago, he was threatening to kill himself (all while drunk). Of course, as worried as we were, he got checked into a mental ward in the nearest hospital to him. We found out he had been sneaking alcohol in his bags to the garage, drinking in his car when no one was there. He checked himself into a facility shortly after the mental ward. Felt like he was really making the steps to help himself.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday, he came over before we all headed to watch an NFL game yesterday. When he came over, he asked for a drink. I felt uncomfortable pouring him one, but equally as uncomfortable watching him pour one. Eventually, he had a drink at our house, then a couple more beers at the stadium.

It is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I fell terrible for things I did and don´t even remember, and it is completely out of character.

I change when I drink, I become more agressive, flirtatious and inconvenient. It is nice at the start, because I feel freed to try making out at parties (I am gay btw, in a conservative latin american country), but sometimes I get past the ""fun"" zone, and the inconvenient part takes hold. 

I´ve never beaten someone, but I am tall (1,90 m) and people get really scared of me, because I can be ""intimidating"". Besides that, recently I had a problem with boundaries with some straight friends, that could have been really problematic if they weren´t amazing. Alcohol gets out the worst in me, and I am loosing friends since last year.

I am 21, and I think I am too young to have so many problems with alcohol, once I drink since I am 17. It takes a lot of liquor to get me drunk, but once I am there, I lose control really quickly. After that I wake up in the next day knowing I did something wrong. 

So, what do you guys think? Should I stop drinking completely and for good? The fact that I tried having a healthy relation with booze countless times, and that I keep doing things that are slowly destroying my social life are some of the reasons I think it might be a good idea.

He's always been a drinker, but I rarely saw him drunk until this past year. Once he got on antidepressants, his alcoholism became extremely obvious. Looking back, it's always been a problem that I was oblivious to.

He's hit a rough patch recently,  with a looming job loss in February, we're 4 years into his identity theft from his uncle, and still battling the IRS, 3 weeks ago his estranged dad came out of the woodwork after 30+ years, plus an unexpected 1/2 sister, and his past abuse has been discussed/dissected for the 1st time ever after dad re-emerged. With that said, he's hit a point where all of his alcohol consumption is done in private. I recently brought him dinner in his car, where he had an empty 5th of vodka next to him along with a 1/2 a dozen empty miniatures. I realized then, that his how much he consumes regularly on his 45 minute commute home.

Before the dad stuff, I was already at capacity. He's mean and nasty to me & our oldest, he works, drinks, sleeps & watches TV. All the work our children, home, pets, family, cars... need comes from me. (This past year, all of those had big problems involving professionals.)

If I'm being honest, I am absolutely repulsed by him. I pray everyday to stop hating and resenting him. I have no partner, and really never did. I've become the bread winner, since it's passive income, he expects me to be a housewife too. It was easier when I was a single mom, than to take care of two, and then him. I started going to Alanon 4 months ago, and am working towards attending regularly.

My goal right now is to double my income so that I can refinance the house and file for divorce. Until then, I need to get along with him, minimize his outbursts around our daughters. I also want to do whatever I can to support him, so that he can land on his feet. With that said, I am still learning how to give him the dignity of figuring it out or asking for my help.

I’m only 24 and had my first drink in college at 18 so I always chalked it up to college going out and drinking culture. 
Someone once said to me, “you either go two ways after college- you barely drink now or you drink way more now” hahaha and I totally free falled into the abyss post college. It’s been years of chaos and unmanageability and I knew I didn’t want to live like this anymore. Today I have 30 days sober and this time around I feel so much better. I was half in, half out before and I was going to AA meetings everyday but was too stuck in my relapse to get out. That first drink led to 2 which led to 3 etc etc which I guess is why they say not to pick up that first drink. 
I went home to my family to gather the strength to restart my sobriety. Much easier (for me) to stay sober around my family in the suburbs than in the big city I live in on my own. I’m back to my regular life now and these past 30 days have been so much gentler and softer and I feel like I’m not suffering as much as I was in the midst of my drinking/drugging. I didn’t drink or drug as much as some alcoholics/addicts but I knew I couldn’t stop when I did. It took over my life for years and only now can I see the blatant red flags of alcoholism. I told people a million times over that I was a “social drinker” but going to the bar on my street every single night and drinking alone for hours on end does not a social drinker make!! AA has been a life saver to me and I KNOW it doesn’t fit in everyone’s life and some people have reservations for many different reasons but I personally really enjoy it and get a lot out of it. Meetings make me feel so good and the people I’ve met are all so great. I think a big part of it was being able to go to a place where there are PEOPLE who are all like me. I have always been a fan of different types of support groups and therapy groups (went to mental health support groups for years) and this is like those but better since it’s more action based and interactive which I like. 
I just wanted to vent and let this out, not looking for anything in posting this and I hate when people say “if I can do it, you can do it” but it’s true!! In weeks post rehab, I got so stuck thinking “I don’t deserve sobriety, I can’t do it, I’m not strong enough at all” but I feel better now. I do deserve it. One of the biggest dreams in my life is to have kids who can say they’ve never seen their mom drunk or on drugs. I know it’s one day at a time and that’s how I’m operating now but good to have dreams, I guess!!

Who’s it for- 


 
Pre-Alcoholic:
Drinking is primarily social. It is used for stress reduction. At this stage, the drinker begins to develop a tolerance for alcohol. 

 
Early-Stage Alcoholic:
Drinkers have experienced their first drinking-related blackout. There may be discomfort around drinking, and/or the realization that alcohol is negatively impacting home, social and/or work life. 

 
Middle Stage Alcoholic:
Drinkers’ symptoms are obvious to friends, family and possibly colleagues. Work, family and social obligations have begun to suffer. There may be prior attempts to treat the addiction.

 

The Science -
Slow My Drinking is safe and medically-validated. Our program has a success rate as high as 78%. It's over four times more successful than AA. 
Our exceptionally high success rate is due to our program’s ‘hero’ medication, Naltrexone. 
Naltrexone is FDA-approved to treat Alcohol Use Disorder. It has a 30+ year track record of success in the United States and Europe. It’s non-addictive and does not cause withdrawal symptoms. 
Simply stated, we call Naltrexone our 'hero' medication because it's safe, effective and has revolutionized the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder.  It has empowered people worldwide to regain control over their drinking.

I live in the UK I'm a 33-year-old woman. My fiancé is 27 and we've been together for over two years now. When we first got together, in fact, on our first date he told me his ex forced him to go to AA meetings. He said he hated it, it was religious and he was called an alcoholic when he felt he wasn't. The ex girlfriend who pressured him to go to AA meetings also used a lot of cocaine so he found it very hypocritical.

We discussed his drinking habits and at the time I was naive. I thought that someone who doesn't drink every day or first thing every morning is not an alcoholic. I knew his ex from a brief conversation, she was... Horrid. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and blew it off. I noticed he drank often but put it down to him being young and Irish. When we drank a lot together we began having fights. I'm not usually someone who fights when I drink.

As time went on and we moved in together I noticed he drank more often than I thought. 3-6 nights a week at least 2 cans of 4.5%-5% at a time but sometimes much more. He was drinking by himself one night and I mentioned something fairly innocuous, he became very rude and cutting, he'd never been like that before.

I told him the next day what he'd said (he had no memory of it apparently) and how he'd made me feel, he apologised and bought me flowers, but he also bought himself a lot of beer and that night it happened again. After that I realised I didn't like the way he is when he drinks and that I needed to set some boundaries.

He said he understood and that he wouldn't drink alone anymore. He didn't keep to that. There was a window of time where there was less drinking and our relationship was good. I even said to him that I'd overreacted. But then he started to have temper flares, especially when he was drinking. He has a tendency to bottle up his feelings. He began to lie about his drinking and started to put cans in the rubbish bin instead of recycling, he started helping less around the house and I was responsible for organising everything. Around this time I became a drug and alcohol recovery worker. He changed job because the previous workplace was awful and he said it was the reason he drank so much but his drinking habits didn't change with the job. 

If I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling about his behaviour he'd say ""I'm trying"" and ""it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough."" He got angry with me for bringing up his drinking all the time saying he was forced to go to AA before and he's not going to go to any alcohol support again. He said that was final and he was putting his foot down. Arguments went back and forth over the issue on and off for months. He said I was ""treating him like one of my clients"" he felt like I was watching him and judging him whenever he drank, even though I was drinking sometimes. I stopped drinking when I fell pregnant by him but had a miscarriage, he didn't stop drinking over that period either. 

He drinks really fast and if I'm not there he drinks a lot more, like he's only drinking less to make me worry less. And I have good reason to worry. One night he went out drinking with some much younger friends and after having a lot to drink he was encouraged to send threatening messages to a 17-year-old who had apparently been accused of rape by at least two girls.

The lads father was going to contact police until my fiance got in touch with him and apologised. I was utterly mortified. He even said he understood if I never wanted to see him again, we'd just got engaged. He said that day he was going to stop drinking, by the end of the day he said he was not going to label himself t-total as he still wanted to drink on special occasions. A week later he'd all but forgotten his pledge and was back to his usual habits.

He'd agreed to do sober October with me but we'd had a fight on November 30th because I called him a doughnut in front of mutual friends and apparently teased him too much, our housemate was there and said my behaviour was nothing out of the ordinary. My fiance had of course been drinking. 

On October 1st he went out drinking with his workmate, he didn't tell me he was going out or when he was going to be home. I waited until gone 8pm to cook dinner because I wasn't sure if he'd be home. I was asleep by the time he got back from the pub. He said he didn't want to come home to me because he was angry with me. He said that I always complain about his behaviour but when he complained about mine it was him being oversensitive.

I had managed to get him to look at the moderation plan I'd found. If I remember correctly it involves keeping a drink diary, then having a month sober, then having a plan for returning to drinking that includes limits and boundaries. I think he got as far as keeping a diary for the week. Arguments became inevitable when he drank, especially if we were out, over really minor infractions on my part. He had a melt down one evening when I wanted to leave a function and yet spent a long time saying goodbye to people. 

Last Thursday I went out for a work meal. I usually host a meeting every Thursday night but that night I left it with him to do. He told me not to get drunk because I needed to complete a Covid form when I got home for our flight the next day. I drank coke and tap water. When I came home the meeting was still going and he was completely drunk, 6+ cans of strong lager. I went upstairs because I was embarrassed. My housemate who chairs the meetings noticed he was incredibly drunk. He passed out before helping me with the flight forms so I had to do them the next morning.

He says he drinks to relax, to relieve stress, when he's nervous and for fun. He will drink more than the majority of people around him. He almost always lies about what he's had. The only time he drinks much less is when he gets back into weight lifting which also seems to coincide with better temperament and seemingly better mental health.

His dad has a similarly poor tolerance for alcohol but not the same temper tantrums. While we were visiting last week he drank so much he collapsed on his way to bed and my fiance had to help him to bed. The relationship between his parents is very similar to ours, she said next time he gets that drunk he can get himself to bed. I think we're both more sensitive than his parents though.

We're still engaged, still trying for a baby as long as he's sober enough to perform and I do still love him but he's still saying I judge him and he feels like I'm watching him. He even started to challenge my boundaries saying that it was judgemental of me to refuse to sleep with him when he's drunk or to avoid potential confrontation if he's only had one drink. On occasions I needed to talk to him about things I was unhappy about but I didn't because he'd been drinking but he just got angry that I was upset and not telling him why.

I will say I find the label ""alcoholic"" unhelpful. Not just for him but people on reddit kept saying I was in denial. We both know he has a drinking problem so there's no denial there but I can't determine the severity or the best way to go about it without leaving him. Most of the time he is kind and affectionate and we really enjoy each others company. Alcohol just seems to strip away his best traits and bring out the bad side, even if he's only had one or hasn't had a drink that day.

This week he's started weightlifting again. He's only had about eight cans of 4.5% though that's still more than the recommended weekly units. We've had a much better week but I'm beginning to sink into depression possibly from carrying the weight of our relationship, the household responsibilities and our joint political ventures on my shoulders. I'm embarrassed that I don't have the answers when I support several people with alcohol addiction.

Redditors typically tell me to leave him, that I'm in denial and that I need therapy because I want to make this relationship work. I will say his behaviour is very rarely abusive. He's kicked a recycling box but I've slammed a door, he's sworn at me and I've probably sworn back. I'll admit he is the escalator, I'm the descalator, almost always. But I don't think his situation is one which can only be solved through abstinence. I would absolutely support him if he were to decide he wanted to be abstinent but is there a better way?

Should I try reintroducing the moderation programme to him in the new year? Should I back off and focus on maintaining my boundaries and doing what I can for myself to be happy and healthy? I don't want to end the relationship. Is there an approach I haven't tried that might work?

2021-12-12 04:28:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/reljb8/first_night_not_drinking_in_a_while/,First night not drinking in a while.,"Ended up in the hospital with alcohol-related pancreatitis not too long back. Stopped drinking for a few weeks, but ended up starting again when my guts were less inflamed. I can't drink the amount I ""need"" to to feel the desired effects without it literally shutting down an organ. The pain is indescribable, and it's not even the first time it's sent me to the ER. I'm not an emotive person in general and I'm more likely to cry about a cute proposal video than physical pain. But goddamnit that shit is serious. Last time I told myself if it happened again I was just going to shoot myself. Pain meds don't really work on me because I'm on opioid blockers so there wasn't much the doctors could/would do. 

With that experience fresh in my mind, and with a less-than fully functional pancreas, I drank pretty soon after I could eat food again. I've been going through phases of cutting down/saying fuckit and going overboard. I haven't been able to break the habit of drinking myself to sleep every night. It's killing me. Every morning, my first waking thought is to probe my abdomen with my finger to see if today's the day my pancreas dies. My bathroom sink is stained yellow from throwing up bile on a daily basis.   As soon as my stomach settles down though, I'll start drinking. A lot of times the first sip triggers a new bout of vomiting. On a long enough timeline I am going to end up in the hospital again. My body can't keep up with my brain's thirst. And, fun fact, a pancreas doesn't just keep regenerating indefinitely. That shit wears out and I'm going to run out of luck sooner than later. 

All this is a dumb rant I'm writing at four a.m. because I can't sleep sober. I decided earlier that I just wasn't going to leave my apartment today. I knew that when I stopped feeling nauseous/hungover I was going to want to drink. I get really panicky as it gets late if there's no booze in my fridge, like fight or flight type shit. Same kind of feeling I'd get when I couldn't afford opiates, and it was pretty terrifying how much it reminded me of the bad old days. 

I broke at 10:30 p.m. and went to a gas station I thought was open. I can't even explain the thought process, the action came from a place of fear and desperation that isn't routed in reality. Got to the gas station and what do you know... closed shop. Part of me was angry/dissapointed/scared but there was a little bit of healthy relief in there too. Got home and searched through my house for any forgotten cans of beer or bottles of wine. Nada. So I guess I kind of on purpose-accidentally-probably made it through the night without booze for the first time in a while. I doubt I'll sleep a wink but I hopefully won't begin the morning retching up battery acid. When I come up for air and get a look at my face in the mirror I just want to die. Broken blood vessels, black bags under my bloodshot eyes, big dumb red nose. I was a healthy kid once and now I'm this ugly shambling mess of a person. 

I don't post much but I'm feeling kinda vulnerable and wanted to vent without waking anyone up/revealing the extent of the problem to people I know. Dumb and harmful, I know, but is what it is right now I guess. I hope I can keep this going for another day/night, and I hope if anybody else is having a rough night that things get brighter for all of us.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.92926097}"

Surprise, I opened the second one, and got really wasted, woke up the next day feeling like crap and then poured it out. It was like over half full still so I basically just wasted $20. This is good though because so far I've learned I can't have alcohol in my house or I'll give in.

I am 32 now, and even my body reacts to alcohol differently. I can't poop that I have to do foam-rolling on my stomach to deal with constipation which I never ever experienced in my life.

I should live at least longer than my parents and pretend to be happy till their RIP. Getting a cancer in the 30s doesn't sound like a good idea, and I know I don't have enough willpower to quit alcohol.

Despite 6 years of failures with all sorts of psych meds, 
I got the naltrexone and camprel prescribed today. 
TBH, I don't have any high expectations.
Psych meds have always worked differently on my brain.

This year I’ve blacked out twice though, within the space of like a month, I don’t know why all of a sudden I’m blacking out more, before recently the last times I blacked out was yeeears ago when I was younger and more crazy. I think there’s probably people who drink more consistently than me who I wouldn’t call alcoholics, but I feel like one for some reason. 

I don’t think any adult should black out, I kinda judge people who do, but yet here I am, I blacked out last night. Now my head is basically filled with non stop “fuck fuck fuck fuck shit wtf wtf wtf did I do oh no fuck fuck,” 

I feel like lowest a person can feel, spent too much money, worrying I done something terrible, I’m sore all over. 

This is a sign that I should stop drinking isn’t it? Cos this isn’t good. Even though for years prior I’d say I was good at drinking socially and enjoyed and appreciated the benefits of alcohol, I like white wine with sea food and all that, and having pints with friends has brought me some glorious magic memories and moments.

Quitting alcohol just seems to extreme to me and like I’d only punish myself more if I done it because if I quit totally I feel like I’d just have a massive blow out if I lost my discipline.

Sorry if this isn’t the best place for this.

I’m a recovering alcoholic, sober about 1.5 years, in a long term relationship with a great guy who’s had much more trouble staying sober. Due to my alcoholism and it’s effects on my family/children, I’ve told him alcohol in any form is not allowed in my home, whether it be in his system or in the bottle. He recently relapsed and drank just a little bit, and I made him leave even though no one would have known. He has been mildly resentful since then because my kids are teens and have been experimenting with pot recently, and he feels like “the rules only apply to him”. We had a lengthy discussion last night where he told me that drinking is a part of who he is, and if I would stop making a big deal about his drinking (ie making him leave, and sticking to my rules) when he only has a little, then he wouldn’t get angry and go on week-long drinking binges. 
I feel like this is a way of shifting the blame onto me and making me the bad guy, instead of him owning his alcoholism, coming to terms with the damage it has done to his life and recognizing he can’t have alcohol in any amount because it always eventually leads to more.
I love him and want things to work, but my gut is starting to give me warning signs that this is very manipulative behavior. Am I wrong?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.68590564}"

Hoping to spread some hope for people new to sobriety or thinking about getting sober. This month will be my 1 year sober and it’s been a hard road. To give some background, my name is Hannah, I’m 21 years old and I’ve already had 2 alcohol withdrawal seizures. At just 18 I would wake up every single day and start drinking the moment I opened my eyes until the moment I would pass out on the bathroom floor. It got very very dark for quite some time. These seizures happened only about 6 or 7 hours after my last drink, that’s how absolutely entrenched I was with alcohol. I believe it stemmed from my mother and grandmother who were both much more severe alcoholics than even I was. When I was 18 I held my 37 year old mothers hand as she lay yellow, bloated, and dying in a hospital bed from cirrhosis. The sound of the death rattle coming from someone you love never leaves your head. I immediately went home that night she died and drank an entire bottle of Jack Daniels. It took me losing custody of my newborn son to pull myself together and get sober. I’ve missed almost year of my sons life. It took a lot out of me to not drink from the depression of losing him, but here I am a year later, still sober, and I am happy to say I will be getting my son back in February. I feel physically and mentally a million times better. I don’t wake up hungover anymore, I’m not having seizures, and most importantly I will not be scarring my child for life. I’ve had very hard days, but my desire for a better future for me and my son overrules my urge to drink. I feel a will to live my life again.

I'm trying to find a middle ground for myself with regards to my alcohol consumption. I'm well aware I'm on probably on the ""blistering alcoholic"" end of things with regards to how much I consume. I also use marijuana on a regular basis to assist with sleeping due to back pain from a vehicular injury. I've been married 16 years and my wife...while knowing full well the family I come from...feels that I 'could' tone it down specifically for health purposes, but she doesn't feel I'm an alcoholic. We both come from families that have members with severe alcoholic issues. I remember my evenings, discussions...I don't 'forget' or act inappropriately (aside from being slightly more boisterous in conversation). However...I often worry I'm over the tipping point of appropriate alcohol consumption. I'm honest with my doctor, I don't hide things (e.g. running to the shed to down a nip)...my family just has a very consistent history of associating drinking with social interaction.

I'm reaching out for advice. The internet is chock full of opinions and literature with regards to this topic. Most talk about ""drinks per day"" and not quantity of alcohol consumed. If I poured .25 fl oz of spirits per drink...a ""per drink"" relation means nothing as far as I'm concerned and that's how places like the Mayo Clinic describe things.

 We have a child together (10 months) and when I got pregnant, we were living in an odd situation. A previous relationship left him a bit stranded (mom abandoned them, she has since gotten clean and is active in my step son's life) and they lived with who is effectively my step son's grandmother. I owned a home, far away, and we met at work (we commuted into work from opposite directions. Me 1.5 hours, and him 1 hour. So that set our homes 2.5 hours apart and I wasn't ready to give up my home....then... pregnancy.) 

So, I uprooted everything to keep my stepson in his school and my husband closer to work as his salary was less than mine- we couldn't justify a 1.5 hour drive for him. Plus the culture- definitely different, and my step son (now 10) had been thru enough instability in his life. So I felt it best to move his direction. Long story short, they NEEDED to have their independence. Living under the same roof as Grammy had become cramped, but while this was a necessary change it was a BIG one. 

Flash forward to maybe a little bit of puberty hormones hitting, maybe a little more drinking post-paternity-leave (as my husband had become increasingly unhappy at work). 

For the record I'm not justifying ANY of this. Just providing context. 

As my step son gets older he does push buttons at times. He does. But I feel my husband pushes buttons more. Or... atleast more than a parent should. My son has an attitude, and sometimes I kind of want to smack him, and yes sometimes I yell and lose my cool. (I don't smack him 😂 ).

 Sometimes we pick on him, in the context of what I think is appropriate (ie. He's trying to explain something on youtube to ""old people"" and maybe we pretend to ""not get it"" more than we actually ""don't get it"" just to get in his nerves).  All this is fine. 

What concerns me is my husband pushing his buttons to provoke physical violence. This only happens, in my experience, when he's been drunk. My son gets an attitude, he puts him in his place and that should be the end of it. (I'm not innocent, sometimes the lingering attitude irritates me and I continue to beat a dead horse) but he beats the dead horse and nudges it close and closer, even after my son's gotten the point, he keeps on going and going and going until my son has two choices. Sit there beaten down and continue to be screamed at (doubtful my husband would let him walk away at this point) or respond. And more than once this response has resulted in violence. And once in particular my son verbally said he was going to punch my husband and my husband got up in his face and challenged him.  And well...my son punched him 🤷‍♀️ I got in the middle of it, screamed at both of them to stop. Sent my son to his room and talked to my husband about how disappointed I was.


I'd be upset if he was 15,16,17,18,19 or 59 and this was happening...BUT HE'S 11 and I don't want him to take this hostility to, for instance, school and do something terrible one day. 

He says he hates his father and wishes his father wasn't a drunk. I don't know what to do. I don't know hot to get through to him, and he definitely won't go to counseling. I've had conversations with him when he's sober and he acknowledges that he needs to do better.

I am not a medical professional or have any former training in psychology I am just a dude who happened to become sober and wanted to share his experience . So don't take everything I say as fact. 

  I have recently quit drinking alcohol after almost 17-18 yrs of on and off heavy/binge drinking. After 1-1.5 months of being sober I have experienced such a positive difference in how I feel, look and handle my emotions. I am 33 yrs old and have lived in Dallas all my life. I had recently finally decided that enough is enough and I am going to stop drinking. This wasn't on some whim or one of those I will never drink again post binge hang over mornings where you gotta be at work in 30 minutes and feel like complete shit. No. certain circumstances in my life (mostly caused by me) have led me down this path to finally really quit  drinking. Along with other physical and mental health conditions that only wouldve worsen had I continued doing what I was doing. Will I be sober forever? Idk. All I know is that what I was doing wasn't helping me be a better human, husband and potential father. 

I can tell you first off it isn't easy (no shit, if it was every alcoholic would do it.) I never realized how much danger i was putting myself in by quitting cold turkey. But I am doing okay for now and seeking the proper medical help. But I digress.  The first few days I felt very irritable and just real snappy w/ my spouse which lasted about a week. The next  weeks I became severely depressed and just did not want to get out of bed at all. The last few weeks up to today I have had severe insomnia, my anxiety is through the roof and I seem to have random headaches that are pretty bad but go away once I eat and drink water I also on and off wake up sweating or just start randomly sweating.  There are some other factors in my life currently that are also effecting me and could be causing some of these symptoms thats why i am seeking medical help and support from my friends ans family.  Now I know this may seem like a random post but I thought maybe hell if one person reads this and it gives them the strength to quit alcohol or to even reduce the amount they drink too a healthier level it would be worth it. You all are brave and beautiful don't forget that. See? Told you short and too the point.

When we can physically move him and he won’t fight us so much we’ll be taking him to the hospital to detox a little more safely.

He’s done this several times, and has suffered chronic pancreatitis as a result. Once they kept him in the hospital for several weeks and had to bring in specialists, then send him to a big city hospital for their expertise. They nearly had to perform surgery bc his pancreas was worsening even with medication- thankfully he took a turn for the better and that was not necessary.

He doesn’t want to get better.

He’s about to enter rehab for the third or fourth time at our insistence, but he’s dragging his feet and complaining about how controlling we are every step of the way.

We’ve gone to family therapy together and he had solo sessions with the same person, and the psychologist ended up doing a soft “firing” of him but offered the rest of therapy if we want it. She basically said, “I’ll keep seeing him if you decide you want to keep paying for it, but until he decides he wants to get better I don’t think any progress will be made.”

His life is not okay. He’s 30 and is literally incapable of having a job bc he’s downing vodka constantly. His bedroom has a very bad smell coming from it, and I’ve determined it’s literally just his body odor that smells so strongly. Even right after taking a shower he will start to smell badly.

I’m heartbroken and we don’t know what to do. My dad is torn between kicking him out and continuing to let him stay bc it seems likely he’ll die if he kicks him out, but living with him has become its own he’ll bc he gets violent.

I would love advice on supporting someone who completed rehab and would also appreciate some perspective on the emotions and concerns I am experiencing as well. I have a feeling that some of my concerns are run-of-the-mill as a family member, but as I haven’t ever gone through this before I would love some guidance. 

First I want to start by saying, I LOVE my mother in law. She is a wonderful, generous, and loving momma bear. She experienced some terrible abuse as a child which undoubtedly has played a big part in her addiction.  She is my husband’s mother and the most incredible grandmother to our three young children who all adore her. She loves them more than anything in the world. So do I. 

My FIL and us kids took away her keys and cards a few weeks before she left to the facility. She had secret accounts to hide her purchases, would withdraw cash from joint accounts to hide her spending further, and she was almost always driving under the influence. Now while she is home on weekends (as per her program), she is persistent in asking for her credit cards and car keys back first thing when she gets home. Her sponsor told her that she herself didn’t have cards or keys for a full year after she rehabbed to help build trust again with her husband, but my MIL just says “you have to trust me at some point,” and gets huffy when we try to discuss our concerns. She kept her alcoholism a secret for a full twenty years before it all came out so we obviously have guards up. She doesn’t seem to grasp that trust is something that needs to be earned back and built again from the ground up. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Should we go into this next season trusting that she can have her keys and cards back without having to “prove” anything? 

There have been a few things she said which raised concern for us when reading her letters to those close to her (the letters as part of the 12-step program). She prefaced my FIL’s letter as “these are [Sponsor]’s words, not mine.” And a few other comments that have us questioning the genuineness of the apologies and grasp on the gravity of her past behaviour. A part of me wants to thinks she was simply nervous to speak the letters and doesn’t totally know how yet to talk about everything. I understand that only she can look into her own heart and know how she is feeling, but all we have are her words - and if she is playing off her words as someone else’s, it’s leaving us feeling a little wary. What do you all think? Should I speak with her sponsor who has been with her on this whole journey about my concerns?

Things were really bad to the point where the ambulance was there at least once a day because he either fell, or attempted to detox on his own, and harmed himself but I will not go into detail about that. He has insane anxiety and depression and obviously addiction issues. 

He was sober for 14 months, then started up again and completely spiraled out of control to the point of not being able to sit. 

So we all decided he needed rehab. He was not sober when he went there, but agreed to go while he was intoxicated.  He was fine the first few days but now says he feels like he is in jail and told a friend that he ‘can’t wait to drink when he gets out of there’. He’s been through all the bs, rehabs that he left in the middle of, you know the counseling, DUI, severe injury that needed surgery. His rehab program is 2 weeks. Garbage I know. But the fact that he went is a step in the right direction. He is scheduled to leave this Friday.

 I told him I would help clean his bedroom while he was away Bc it is disgusting, old food, so many bottles, disorganization etc. but he told me he wants to do it to ‘feel like he accomplished something’ and wants to clean when he comes back. I’m afraid he will find a bottle somewhere and drink it, that’s what happened lastime. 
BUT my aunt (his sister) who is extremely controlling went through his room and basically tore it apart to get bottles, she told him that on the phone and he was furious.

I don’t have the intense “urge” to drink right now just because I remember how fucking miserable I was while drinking, but I am way more aware of my cynicism and how easily irritated / annoyed I get and realize that’s mainly why I love alcohol ; to suppress those feelings. 

I am much happier in general already, although I go through waves of anger, shame, irritability and sadness. But I’m sleeping better, I have more energy, I’m eating right, I’m not an embarrassment to be around, and I don’t wake up worried I did something awful while drunk the night before. 

I know my drinking problem is still a problem, and I’m going to keep working on staying away from it. I’m not saying I’m “cured”, it’s only been a week.

When I returned, she was passed out and couldn't hear me knock.  I had to get a spare key from my mom who lived cla few miles away.  When I got into the house, she was in the restroom.  After she was in there for quite a while, I opened the door to find her almost completely unresponsive.  Her eyes were open and she was kind of moving around, but she wasn't responding to my words or my touch.  It was terrifying, so I called her an ambulance.  

She was released from thr hospital the next day, and I  picked her up from her home so she could grab her car from my house.   She apologized, buy still seems out of it. I figured it as because it was so soon after drinking too much.  Her blood alcohol level was something like .4 %. But since then, our interactions have been really odd. 

She often repeats things, and sometimes she says things that just don't make sense - a string of words that doesn't complete a thought.  She accused me of saying something mean to her brother, and he called me angrily to ask about it.  That was cleared up, luckily, but my friend barely cared what she had done to herself (or to me).  

(An aside- before the incident, she admitted to having a problem and was going to regular meetings and therapy.  She is no longer going to those meetings and I've smelled alcohol on her in our few meetings since.)

I wont get into details but I’ve had mental health issues and social anxiety for about a decade, and I still remember when I first started getting drunk at family gatherings around 16-17. That was when I knew that alcohol made me feel normal, or like things were okay. I could talk to people more normal than before, and didn’t have to think too much about anything stressing me out.

And from there I wouldn’t really drink a lot except for at family gatherings. Even when I turned legal age, I still didn’t really drink regularly, but I remember always thinking ‘I wish there was an antidepressant that felt like alcohol’.

It wasn’t until this year that I have noticed myself becoming more dependent on drinking, sometimes not even for any reason other than I crave it, but mostly I do it because I feel empty in my life a lot of the time and it’s a good distraction. I drink if there’s a social situation making me anxious, sometimes to go to work or at work in general, or just because I’m depressed. I don’t do it too often, but at least a couple times a month.

So, It all started on a Monday morning after a weekend of binge drinking during the entirety of my waking hours. This was a typical weekend for me, as at the time I was a HEAVY drinker. IIRC, that morning, I took my regular two shots or, so, after waking up (this was the start to every morning). I made my way to work (I don't drive) and all is seemingly well. The last thing I remember was checking email. 

&#x200B;

When I came-to, I'm in my chair slumped over, I don't really know where I am, and my co-worker is standing over me, with a very  bewildered expression on his face. I just remember him pointing to the ground and asking ""Dude, are you okay?"" There was blood all over the floor, and my mask was completely soaked. I had no clue what had happened. No idea how long I was out, or anything. Nothing like that has ever happened to me in my entire life. 

&#x200B;

Long story short, I ended up at instacare, and then the hospital, I explained to the doctor that I had no idea what happened. I am a diabetic, and my sugar levels were low, but not low enough to slip out of consciousness (so, I'm told). Upon  further examination, the doctor noticed that I had wet myself, too. 

&#x200B;

It's important to note, that I did not disclose my alcohol use to the doctor, as my co-worker (warehouse lead) was with me the entire time. In retrospect, I probably should have. I would have got the help sooner than later, and I possibly could have saved my job; that's a story for another time.

&#x200B;

The only thing I could think of at the time, is that I did take an OTC pill for joint movement that morning, and thought that may have been the culprit. The experience wasn't really all that traumatic, so I guess I didn't think too much of it ATM, other than, man... that was weird.

&#x200B;

But now that I think about it, I'm like did I have some sort of withdrawal seizure? But it makes no sense to me, as I already had a bit of alcohol in my system.

2021-12-01 21:02:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/r6vt4u/my_friend_is_spiralling_into_alcoholism_and_i/,My friend is spiralling into alcoholism and I don’t know what to do,"This is going to be really fucking long but I need to get it off my chest.

My oldest friend, (let’s call him Jim) who I’ve known literally since I was born and lives down my road, is on a terrible trajectory. He’s always liked a drink, but recently it has been above and beyond.

He has a history of alcoholism/other substance abuse in his family. His father was a raging alcoholic, to the point where he crashed his car into the tree in my front garden whilst driving to the off-license (which is literally 200m down the road) to buy more wine. I remember going to his house as a kid and his dad was always absolutely plastered by about 5pm every night to the extent that he was completely incoherent. I often heard him aggressively arguing with Jim’s mother. He died 5 years ago of throat cancer, which we mainly believe to have been caused by the constant alcohol consumption.

Then, two and a half years ago, Jim’s little sister, after going down a dark path catalysed by the death of their father, died from an overdose aged just 18. This leaves just Jim and his mother, who also likes a drink.

Now, don’t get me wrong, the last 5 years have been completely and utterly, diabolically tragic for this family. It is truly devastating. I’d be drinking too if I was in there position.

But Jesus Christ.

I’ve been away at uni for a few years but recently graduated and returned home so have been spending more time with Jim. There has been just one time since graduating in August that I’ve seen him even remotely coherent. That day, we went out for a quick lunch on a Tuesday and he ordered a pint of beer and also a Piña Colada. Again, perhaps not too outrageous, but it was like midday on a Tuesday.

All of the other times, he has been absolutely battered. He invited me to the pub (where else?) shortly after I got home from uni and he told me to knock at his house in the way down and he’d come out. I got to his and he was already completely trashed. He was drinking Bacardi and Coke and had already got through about three quarters of a bottle. He offered me one, and filled the glass up with at least 60% Bacardi and maybe 40% coke. It was disgraceful. He made himself one too, and downed it instantly. And then another, and then another. I could not understand anything he was saying the entire time. He was just incoherently babbling and “dancing” to UK Drill. Eventually his mother got back from a long workday and was fuming with him, so I quickly left.

A few weeks later, my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. Jim invited me to the pub (again) to seemingly cheer me up and I thought hey, that’s nice of him, I’ll go down there. I arrived, at 4pm on a Sunday, and he was absolutely paralytic. Again he could barely talk. Random people in the pub were asking me why he was so fucked up at this time. 

Turns out he’d woken up that morning, still drunk from the night before and had left his car 5 miles away. His mum demanded they walk the 5 miles to pick his car up, in the hope that the walk would sober him up. When they got to he car, she told him to wait in there while she ran in to the shop to buy some groceries. He found another bottle of Bacardi in the back of his car so just started drinking it straight. Back to square one.

He recently got a new job and on his second day they told him to go home because he turned up drunk at 8AM. Our other friends told me he drove while paralytic the other day. He does this regularly. He has no regard for anything.

Every time he calls me now, he’s paralytic and trying to go to the pub. All he wants to do is drink.

Apparently many of our friends are distancing themselves from him now. They all went to Prague a few months ago and he got so drunk in the pub that he just stood up and pissed in the beer garden, which was right next to a children’s playground. Parents complained, so the entire group got kicked out of the pub.

I could go on, but I’m sure you get the idea. When you’re unable to even do your job, when you’re whipping your cock out to piss in front of a children’s playground, and when you’re regularly endangering innocent people by drunk driving, it’s time to stop.

The kicker is, while at uni I developed an *extremely heavy* weed addiction. During the first year I also was pretty much a poly-addict and never spent a day sober. I barely touched alcohol, ironically, but did use just every other substance under the sun, but that is besides the point. 

Multiple people tried to intervene and told me to stop on many occasions, but I didn’t listen. I only stopped when I finally decided for myself that I wanted to. Nobody convinced me to. I had a horrific health scare and it literally sobered me right up. Now I just drink socially (which is rare because I’m very introverted), but otherwise I no longer smoke weed or do any other drugs. I don’t even have the urge to. I like being sober. But *I decided this for myself*.

The point is, I know first hand what addiction is like and that other people telling you to stop is largely fruitless. I fear that Jim here is in the same boat. Actually, a worse boat.

See, during my time of addiction, I was just lost and directionless, at uni when I really didn’t want to be. That’s a lame fucking excuse. Whereas Jim, the poor guy, lost his father and his little sister in the space of two years.

As I said, I know first hand that telling him to stop isn’t going to have much, if any impact, and in fact I have told him he should cut it down on several occasions. And believe me, I completely understand how his circumstances have led him here, but I feel it is only a matter of time before he ends up killing himself or someone else.

Does anyone have any advice for what I can do in this situation? I feel completely helpless, but standing by idly makes me feel completely awful.

Both are super sweet and easy to get along with, well so we thought. G is someone who has like 3 glasses of wine and weed every night and adds rum to her coffee and then laughs about how her doctor said she was a high functioning alcoholic after her blood results came back. Y is smoking weed all day and drinks about 2 bottles of wine a night, sometimes more.

I’m in school for psychology and my friend works as an ECE and may have a new job opportunity as a nanny. So we are busy and need to maintain some degree of a schedule and responsibility. 

The other two are extremely immature and jobless. I know why (past trauma and alcoholism) but it is still annoying for both my friend and I as we do most of the cleaning and I do the driving for everyone because im the only one with a car and a license.

Even G said that Y was losing her shit on her when they were coming back from the mall and left to go to the liquor store.

I have been enabling him by ignoring the problem. I have second thoughts and want to set boundaries, but unsure if this would even help. 

Edited for clarity.

There were many moments when we were first dating that I could’ve seen the problem. We would get together at the bowling alley or do open mics at a bar (2 solo act musicians), and he drank all night. I didn’t see the warning signs until we moved in together. It was the very beginning of COVID when everything had shutdown and masks were just becoming a widespread thing. I saw the problem but didn’t want to face it. We drank together, went out with friends to bars. This was early in the relationship still. I don’t have an unhealthy relationship to alcohol, but I noticed I was drinking much more than before while with him. 

Now, 2 years later, I decided enough.  He has tried to quit multiple times now, but refuses to try AA due to the religious angle. In his mind, he has the ability to control it and stop on his own. But he lives alone now (long story, we had to move out of our apartment due to bedbugs in 2019 and are now living separately), and has fast access to beer from his apartment. He keeps spiraling out—going cold turkey for a week, then turning back to the bottle. And it’s never hard liquor, which I used to justify my ignoring the problem. He only drinks cheap, low % beer, only at night and after work. He limits himself to his apartment and never drives drunk. But he’d drink 6-8 beers a night, every night. 

I was enabling him to drink by ignoring the problem. I tried to stop, and stopped drinking around him. We had many arguments. I’d say my piece, that I was worried for him and wanted him to seek external help, whatever that may be. I can’t be his therapist. He’s tried many things he says, but wants to try and quit on his own. I feel like I am adding to the problem. 

He is majorly depressed, deals with OCD and acute anxiety. His reasoning is that alcohol quiets his mind and numbs his senses, so it’s like medicine. Problematic. He went through a bout of getting a new job (service industry), quitting it for a small reason, and moving on to another. This happened maybe 4 times in the last 3 months. I am so worried for him, and now it is affecting my own mental health. Should be a full-stop right there, right?

I broke up with him last night, and while he protested, he agreed it wasn’t helping either of us that I was essentially enabling him to backslide (not that he blamed me). That’s when he told me he’d JUST quit his new job that day and was planning on taking 2 weeks to work on his addiction and go cold again. 

I really fucking miss him. I realized he’s my comfort blanket, which is already unhealthy, but I feel really at home when I’m with him. We have so much history. Breakup was very last minute and rushed, which is why I’m having second thoughts. If I set boundaries for what I’m willing to do/be with him I feel like I could make it work and support him without hurting him, but would need him to try something else to help.
