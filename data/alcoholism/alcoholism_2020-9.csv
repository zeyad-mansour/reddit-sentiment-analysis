On September 28th 2015 I was found in my room by my Dad by chance and it would change everything. 911 was called but before anyone got there I remember taking one more sip and saying to myself ""this is the last shot i'll take, whether I live or die""

The police and paramedics, doctors and nurses saw a 23 year old very near his end. None of whom thought I would survive the night. They certainly didn't believe why I was 105 pounds and dark yellow at such an age. I was drinking a liter of vodka a day. Regardless, they did their job, they gave me a blood transfusion and took very close care of me and in a month managed to save my life. 

From Stage 4 cirrhosis/failure of the liver, Stage 3 hepatic encephalopathy, heavy jaundice, needing a transplant and in an extremely altered state. My addiction had taken it's toll, but Death recieved no such satisfaction. 

On October 24th 2015 I was released to go home and continue the battle, one I literally didn't know was coming. Doctors told me ""six months"" of no drinking and i'll be on the transplant list. For the next two and a half months, while I was actually conscious now, my altered state continued and manifested itself in memory loss and both auditory and visual hallucinations. 

Then on December 3rd, back in the hospital for overnight tests, I was told my liver had begun regeneration. After that I took my medication to clean my blood, finally started to eat again and suddenly I woke up one day in early January 2016. Took a shower, put on my favorite Iron Maiden shirt and went to the doctor. Only this time I was finally ""awake"" and aware of everything. My skin was back to normal, I had gained weight and my encephalopathy or altered state was gone. I had officially survived and conquered the first and biggest steps. Stay alive and get sober. Now the everlasting task of staying sober. 

I had a ton of doctors to visit over the coming months and years but with each appointment my liver just kept getting better and better until the words ""liver transplant"" were thankfully a forgotten phrase. The lasting effects and damage I have caused not only to myself but to my friends and to my family are a sharp point both in my addiction and in my sobriety. It is a hard reminder of what I had done. 

But I am pleased to say that today, the 29th of September 2020, in this horrible year, I mark a very proud moment in celebrating FIVE years sober. My life was saved, I survived and I continue to live, and though I have permanent nerve damage in my eyes, legs and feet, it is far better than what could have been.

If you have read this far, I thank you. Please if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction tell them my story and to please not go this far. I blacked out most of that final year and can't remember much before the hospital so I did not know to get help or how. I used alcohol as a medicine and know others use drugs the same way. Maybe this will help others to know it's never too late, you can break addiction and live again. 


I was asked by my Father on that final day, ""do you want to die?"". I said, no.

Its something I wrote fresh out of my last rehab and often share with my group. Paradoxical Comfort.,"The funny thing about comfort is that it does not have to be rooted in anything positive or healthy for ones being. It can just as easily be established by something negative or toxic.
Comfort is often found within our normality, the things that are familiar to us. These things are predictable. That easily foreseen future is effortlessly prepared for, causing little malaise and surprise.
Wanting to grasp tightly to these negative things that have for so long brought about a paradoxical comfort to me is understandable.
Only with deep introspection of oneself, an understanding of what I truly want and need, can I accept my negative actions of the passed that have hindered the wellness of my being. Not allowing myself to become a victim to them so that I may instead learn and decide I'm not walking down this path anymore.
Change is never easy, regardless if I'm aware that it leads towards a brighter future. The path can be tormenting and slow, filled with obstacles and relapses of a more familiar way.
However, commitment to a new reality, despite the difficulty of the journey must be realized and held onto no matter the hardships if my being is to flourish and grow.",2,0

&#x200B;

Let me start with that I've been reading some hopeful stories in this group and I want to thank everyone for sharing their stories.  
Alright so I am starting to think alcohol is becoming a problem in my life and I wonder is anyone else might recognize some of the things I am about to tell and maybe can offer some advise on how to deal with them.

In the beginning I go/used to go to a lot of parties during the weekend and I would usually end up drinking to the point of getting sick and going way overboard with the quantities. Back then though it was still all fun and games and most of my friends drink on a regular basis also so I never saw a problem.

After the parties in the weekend I started to drink in the week also, not daily but it became a more consecutive habit. Still I didn't see much of a problem at the time either because overall everything seemed to be going fine regardless, I still had lots of friends, Got myself a stable and nice girlfriend etc.

As of lately though I am starting to notice this ""habit"" is becoming a problem. If I have a bottle of alcohol in my house I will end up drinking it every day until it is empty. I am starting to notice the sudden downward mood when sober and well my girlfriend is starting to get worried about it as well. The problem is sometimes I am starting to feel outright depressed but when I start drinking again it starts to go away. I am noticing I am becoming increasingly emotionally unstable when not drinking and somewhat emotionally unresponsive towards my SO and friends when sober.

Frankly I know I'm at fault for this and I am noticing my entire character/behaviour changing because of it and not in a way that benefits either my SO,friends or myself and its reached a point where it is causing huge rifts between me and the people I care for. 

Did any of you guys go through this? and if you did how did you manage to pull through and turn it around? Also what do I need to expect/prepare for when going down this path?",4,0

I know this is bad, since going more than 2 days is getting harder and harder, and it hit home when I did a rough calculation of how much I spent on booze since December: ~$4k CAD. Seeing that number hit me the same way as doing the same calculation before I quit smoking 6 years ago! That's a lot of money!

I have been drinking at the rate that I do, on and off, since I was 16. It definitely got more frequent during quarantine and when I moved out.

My parents are both alcoholics and I am a lot like them where I cannot have fun without drinking. They have been drinking and partying multiple times a week since I was a really young child and it’s also gotten worse. I’m starting to realize the learned behaviour around alcohol.

I am quitting drinking all together because I feel like I need to reestablish my confidence and sociableness that I had before I relied on drinking. I need to learn how to be in a social situation without having a few drinks and make friends who I want to be around when I am sober.

However I can somehow function normally and work a full time job. My main worry is my health, I have been hospitalised 3 times for pancreatitis due to alcohol and the withdrawls are the worst I have felt In my life. I have pushed pretty much all my friends away in favour of alcohol, the main reason I drink is boredom and it was the same before covid I have no hobby's and my life is just work and drinking I have too much anxiety about going to AA or a clinic hence why I am messaging here, I seem to get no support from others as I am only 20 and apparently too young to be an alcoholic.

41,2020-09-26 14:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j0aw33/question_about_tapering/,Question about tapering,"So, I began tapering this week. I had a bad weekend last weekend, where I probably drank more than I have in a very long time. Monday was particularly rough in terms of anxiety, the shakes, mild sweating... so I numbed it all with 3/4 of a fifth (I know, I know...) so, when I woke up Tuesday I vowed to myself I am done. But I was scared to go cold turkey (been a heavy drinker for 8-10 years, sometimes taking time off, some nights heavier than the others, but pretty consistent). 

Anyway, so I took Tuesday night off. Anxiety was mild during the day on Tuesday, minor shakes, mild sweating but that was it. 

Wednesday was okay. No real withdrawal symptoms. Had 3 bud light platinums over the course of 3ish hours. 

Thursday was the same. No real withdrawal symptoms. Went to the doctor to get blood work, and had a higher than average HR, but I had to fast and had coffee (plus a little anxiety), blood pressure was 120/70. Took Thursday night off. 

Yesterday was GREAT. Almost zero anxiety, mood was great, I left the house for 4 hours and went shopping and ran errands (which is a big deal because I have a hard time leaving the house because of my anxiety) and even had no trouble talking to the staff in all of the stores I was in. Even attended my first virtual AA meeting! Then had 3 IPAs (9%) over the course of 3 hours last night. (Also I know I attended AA and still drank, I’m a work in progress; I just really wanted to attend a meeting)

Today I woke up, felt fine (and slept great), had 2 giant coffees (probably 24-32oz total), and started to panic. Drank a Gatorade, took my vitamins, ate. Didn’t exactly help. My fiancé swears it’s the coffee. My heart rate is ok, a little high for my average, so I’m monitoring regularly. Tonight is an off night. 

I’m wondering if it’s maybe withdrawal symptoms still or if I am tapering too fast?",5,0
42,2020-09-26 09:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j06e2q/experiences_with_extreme_hangovers/,Experiences with extreme hangovers,"Over the years I've been getting nastier and nastier hangovers. Probably started in my early 20s when I was drinking for days in a row, at least on the weekends. I eventually started to get hangovers that were so prolonged and drawn out, I sort of have to describe them in steps, almost like phases.

Phase 1: pretty much still drunk, this happens right after I wake up and lasts maybe until noonish or at least 3-4 hours after I wake up. The scary part about this phase is I still feel ""good"" and have driven multiple times like this, knowing I could get a dui. I mean I've driven 3 hours and worked a 12 hour shift doing this.

Phase 2: the actual hangover, this is where I get the hangxiety, feel achy, nauseous, headache, loss of balance/coordination, you know typical hangover stuff. All these symptoms and more will last up until the moment I go to bed that night.

Phase 3: day two, achy, my eyes feel sore (sleep quality has been horrendous for both days) and of course dehydration. My stomach feels constantly empty and I'm a little shaky with some muscle spasms.

Phase 4: basically the same as three but just much more mild and this can go onto a third day if I got drunk enough

Now, how much booze does it take to get like this? Not much at all really. Just recently in one night I had 3 IPAs at 8% and some sake at 19% (like 12 oz maybe). Which even consumed over the course of only a few hours, is quite moderate. I used to drink all day long until I blacked out, came to and then repeated. Even the thought of getting black out or drinking until I throw up scares me and I fear it may lead to long term affects. 

So to conclude this I'll list some positives and some negatives

Negatives: obviously my overall health, especially sleep and quality of sleep, I get horrible insomnia and will sleep maybe 3-4 during these extended hangovers. I lose some form of memory during intoxication, the hangover and after. I'll forget simple words, names and phases and lose my train of thought frequently. I mostly fear that drinking like this could eventually lead to some sort of mental illness.

Positives: I still have a great time with friends and find it to be a great social lubricant, and being fairly extroverted its usually worth it to tie a decent buzz on. I also am still able to function very well whilst hungover and coworkers have told me they didn't even notice, which is sort of a double edge sword if you think about it. I don't get that bad of anxiety or depression from hangovers anymore probably because I don't hate my life and I'm generally happy. If anything these shitty hangovers make it easier to abstain from alcohol, but I still have the propensity to binge drink.

Really i just wanted to make this post to see if anyone has similar experiences and how they dealt with them. I've basically given up on trying ""remedies"" as they really just make you feel only slightly better, i know the real answer is abstinence. I also admit that I may not seem like much of an alcoholic but when I was in the military I had a much bigger issue with not only alcohol but also drug use.

I realize this is sort of a lengthy post so pardon me for yammering away lol but I feel like this is the most efficient way to get some insight. I don't think I need help necessarily but would love to hear some other stories and everyone's thoughts and of course start some discussion.",3,0

***ALSO I AM TERRIBLE AT WRITING, THIS MAY BE EMOTIONAL BABBLE.***

&#x200B;

Hey there, my name is Adam and I am 22 years old. I have had an alcoholic parent for 10 odd years probably more. After so long you become numb to the fact that this substance has taken a hold of your parent and the parent you grew up with from a young age, isn't the same being in the slightest. They are forgetful, unforgiving and very toxic in many ways. Let this be physical abuse, verbal abuse or mental abuse.

After years of terrible family events, suffocating Christmas's and thousands of drunken arguments. I and my mother finally came to the peak of our torment. My Father tried to kill me and then got into my Mothers car, not his. Drove a mile away to only turn around and full force ram into the family home. I was going to kill my own Father with a kitchen knife, right in front of off duty police officers, on duty police officers and civilians. It didn't matter anymore because this man would be even more cancerous than the cancer my mother had been dealing with since I was 3 years of age. I was luckily stopped by my mother as she grabbed the kitchen knife by the blade to stop me doing an idiotic rage moment.

2 years had passed and my father, who never believed in mental illness and riddled me because I admitted I had Multiple Personalities Disorder, ADHD, OCD, Depression blah blah blah. I thought YES, He is finally understanding even though I know he has suffered with it forever and turned to alcohol to create this barrier of numbness, even that wasn't helping anymore because he had lost everything. I was happy without him in my life finally but everyone around him watched him crumble and then begged me to forgive him, like it would change him and help him better himself. I finally caved to the guilt that was pushed onto me believing this would be the change my Father needed. Although he had been to prison for 7 years, he had done numerous probations and alcohol therapy treatments. I some how thought me, his son would be the answer.

thus it was not. It's been nearly 2 years after forgiving him and its been just as painful maybe even more than before he tried to kill me. I know what animal my father is, as a child I did not. There was so much hope and bullshit clouding reality.

As a child you take a lot as face value but as an adult you analyse everything and actually realise what most peoples intentions can lean towards at least I can tell because I have spent so many years watching and listening to thousands of people across the world telling me and confiding into me, with their life story and the pain they carry. Now Alcoholics are generally self conflicted, self obsessed people who victimise themselves and shit on a real victim.

He has told me I and my mother are liars about that night he tried to kill me, He has said many times he doesn't love me whilst being drunk. Has spat on our names so many times yet my mother and I still try to help him.

In my eyes at this point, it's not even worth it. Yet I still know its inevitable that I will cross his path and try to lend a hand to him, as he is my parent that I have parented for far to long. It's just normal to be shit on, to then help him.

If I don't help him I feel like I will be told he was found cold and blue... As if me not aiding my father and inflicting this abuse onto myself will be the sole reason he had finally lost to alcohol.

Not sure if I would be sad or relieved when the day comes, because I don't think it will be long before alcohol wins.

&#x200B;

If you are a parent or guardian then please remember all of your drunken words; mental breakdowns and day drinking. Rubs off onto your child even if you don't see yourself to be as abusive as my father. Everything you do matters. You are meant to set a foundation for your child to surpass. You're choosing to give them terrible foundations if you continue to abuse your mind, body and family, by drinking alcohol.

If someone around you suffers with alcohol abuse, just remember the alcohol isn't them and try to hold onto the parts of them that aren't drowned in the liquid death. If you are lucky then they will wake up and better themselves, but if you are unlucky I am sorry you lost your parent/s to something they had a choice in. The feeling after years of heartache never really goes, you just come to understand it.

***If anyone ever needs to lean on someone, I am here. I am a stranger but I live life unlike most people. I speak my mind, I am not afraid of saying harsh words that you need to hear or comforting ones if you haven't heard them before. I know how much healing some compassion can do as I lived without it for years or at least hid myself from it.***

However back then it would always just be a beer once in a blue moon or something at family parties. 

Recently, as in this last year I’ve noticed I’ve been drinking every weekend and every time I’m stressed. I live with my boyfriend and we go/do almost everything together so on weekends while he likes to get high-since drinking really isn’t his thing except every now and then, I buy a daiquiri filled with 3-5 shots. If we’re at a party I drink beer after beer, or down bottles until I nearly black out. I don’t know why, but I can never just have one. Not one shot, not one beer. 

Also, any time we get into a big argument I tend to go buy a daiquiri loaded with shots just so I can sleep worry free. Any time I’m in a big social setting, which is rare, I want a few drinks to make it easier to talk to people. 

At first I was having fun, but now I’m worried about if this seems like it could go down the wrong path? I would love to stop turning to alcohol any time I’m stressed or want to have fun. It’s not like I crave it when I’m just home for the evening, but nearly every weekend I end up blacked out because I couldn’t have just one or because I was stressed and I need help.",9,0

Do I have a problem?,"Hi guys, I think I already know the answer to this question, but I am going to ask it anyway, because I have no motivation to change things, but I wish I did.
I have a full time job, I have a 3 year old, a partner, many hobbies, and am also studying to change careers. On weekdays I work and am an absolute powerhouse. I get everything done, I eat all my macros, I run three times a week, and lift heavy weights three times a week. Then friday night comes. We've been doing this for 5 years. The weekend is for binge eating and binge drinking. The eating I can mostly control, but the drinking I look forward to all week. It is the only time I can unwind, and let go of all my thoughts. The weeks are crazy, and I accomplish a lot, but I do so knowing I get to let go on the weekends.

As soon as I drink I am happy doing the mundane things. Looking after my child and playing toys with him, spending time with my partner, working on programs that I am writing (yes, I am much better at this when I am drinking). All my productivity is generally better when I am drinking. 
But I know I have a problem, because the weekend daytime hours SUCK. Sure, during this time we can't go anywhere or do anything, so it especially sucks. But this problem has been going on for years. I don't want to go anywhere at night, because I want to stay home and drink and work. I just want to drink. Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. I drink from 5pm til I go to bed, and feel miserable til about 3pm the next day. 
Why am I doing this? Can I stop? The problem is I don't really care. I work so hard during the week and I enjoy this time to myself, but I also work really hard on my fitness, and I can't get results, because of these 3 nights of drinking! All I need to reveal all the muscles I've built is about 5kg of fat loss. But I can't do it. Who cares anyway, not like we can go outside.

But this leads me to ask the question, why do I look forward to this so much? Why is the whole week a struggle, and the weekend nights are my happy time? The only time I look forward to? Why do I open the liquor cabinet silently at 1am when I am up gaming late to not alert my partner to the fact that I am still drinking? Why don't I want him to know? Surely that is a problem. Imagine life without alcohol...but will I lose myself? Will my creative self NEVER come out? Because that is the only time she comes out.

Not to mention, If I am not drinking, I will do a couple hours of work/study and go to bed at a reasonable hour. If I am drinking, I can work from 9pm-4am without any issues, get a HELL of a lot done. So why would I want to stop?

Tl;dr: I don't want to lose my creative/grounded/productive self, that comes out on the weekend while I am drinking. I am worried I will lose myself if I give up drinking.",36,0

I have severe social anxiety and the only way I feel comfortable hanging out with my friends is to drink. They are all heavy drinking alcoholics so hanging out there sober is incredibly difficult if not impossible. A friend in our group actually had to move recently to a different state because he's up there in age and is starting to have health problems. He couldn't stop hanging out with us/stop drinking so he moved near his sister across the country.

I've gotten to the point where I limit myself to 1 pint of nasty cheap gin in a night, but I'm drinking far too often. I am disabled so I don't work. Other than volunteering at the free kitchen downtown once or twice a week, I have nothing but time on my hands. That means I'm getting drunk about once every 3 days. That's the part that is concerning me. If I was doing this once a week, I wouldn't think much of it.

I'm getting better at staying out of trouble when I'm drunk though so I guess that's a good thing. It's not like I'm still going out to the bar, driving, getting in fights, and putting myself in dangerous situations (I haven't driven drunk or buzzed in about 12 years). We mostly just sit around, listen to music, and play chess. If I were to give up alcohol, that would almost certainly mean I'd have to stop hanging out with my friends.

How bad is this? I don't really have a life for this behavior to affect, past the health aspect. Like I said, we're just listening to music and playing chess (staying out of trouble). How concerned should I be about this behavior? Don't worry about judgement, I have thick skin.",6,0

This is the longest I’ve gone without alcohol since 2015.,"I (24F) decided to get sober on 9/13, after finally acknowledging it was making me impulsive and emotionally dysregulated. I was the party girl...the life of the party. However, I would still go from happy to sad to anxious to happy all in an hour and feel like crap the next day. I thought it was normal being like this and not having much energy. It had to be the clinical depression which I've battled with for 11+ years. 

On that sunday night, my boyfriend made dinner for me and i drank a bottle of wine. He told me i was talking really loud and drunk me got irritated at him. After calming down, I laid in my boyfriends bed and thought about how happy I am with him and I don’t want the crazy mood swings alcohol causes to ruin my relationship. Him and my therapist are the only ones that know about my battle with alcohol. Three days later he told me he needed to be alone for a few days. He later broke up with me because he had his own demons he was hiding. He has been struggling with his own mental health and needs to work on getting himself better.This was out of the blue and i am still in shock. As someone who struggles with depression and anxiety as well, i get it. You need to put yourself first but that doesn't make it hurt any less. He is not speaking to me right now and I miss him so much.There isn’t a day that goes by that i don’t break down and cry about what happened.  I wish i could call him and tell him i made it to 10 days. We used to talk multiple times a day. He would always call me in the morning and after dinner. He was my best friend. Yes, we were only together for 7 months but he was my first taste of a healthy relationship with someone who loved and cared for me. For 7 months i had someone who i knew i could turn to and now its gone. I just wish I could go back and be sober during our relationship so I could really take in and appreciate all those amazing moments with him.

Since I was about 14 or 15 I have been experimenting with drink and drugs and by the time I was about 18 or 19 it was becoming a regular multiple times a week occurance. Spending most nights in the pub drinking and often getting a small bag of coke in. By the time I was 21 the drinking and the coke sniffing was just normal and I never had an issue getting up for work the next day and I was holding down a job so it never seemed an issue. 

At this stage I was in a relationship with someone who was also on the same page as I was with alcohol and substances. We decided to go away travelling and try to get away from it. Moving to a country with absolutely no cocaine at all. Unfortunately that meant that our drinking went up even more and the first month we was both blind drunk for about a month straight.

As the year went on we both became psychotic without the coke and the drinking carried on getting heavier and heavier. It got to stage where we would argue and I would go on 2 day binges just walking around outside on my own only to wake up to an ambulance trying to resusate me. When the ambulance took me home because I refused to go to the hospital I would head straight back out again to drink.

I eventually went to AA meetings but she did not, I actually done pretty good and was two months sober the happiest I had been in years. Clear minded and felt healthy. Unfortunately after two months I felt like I had cured my problem and eventually started drinking again as my girlfriend was still going out partying and I felt like I was missing out. 

To cut a long story short we are no longer together but now I'm at a stage where I'm back to where I was more or less 1 year ago.

I'm drinking every night with the intention of only having a 6 pack but that leads to another 6 pack and that leads to one or two long necks. I usually pass out and wake up at 5 am for work. The past week I have woke up in my own piss where ive blacked out on my bed. ( I rarely ever used to do that maybe twice in my life before that)

I'm waking up with the same cycle of thoughts and emotions.  First I usually feel a bit tipsy from the night before then I tell myself that I'm going to sort my life out and almost day dream about being sober and healthier almost of a bit of a buzz. Then straight after that servere anxiety and I worry about everything and hate myself. By the end of the working day I am back to normal and shake it off as if it was nothing. I feel like there is a big part of me that dosent want to stop but a big part of me hates myself for it and knows how much it would benefit my life to stop.



There's so much more I could say but  I don't want to go on and on. Just wanted to get it off my chest as I usually don't talk much about it to people.",3,0

According to a calculator, and time spent drinking after work or on the weekends, every day, my BAC should end up around 0.36%. If calculators are correct, I should have WAY more serious issues. Not sure how to go about quitting but it's starting to get a bit serious in the health department.

I was just wondering if anyone else is on this level, and what their experience with it was? Any thoughts?

I was on a slippery slope to it ruining my life. I went through almost a handle of Jim Beam, and a 12 pack of beer a week. I was starting to drink in the morning and before work. I'd have multiple shots of whiskey before I'd even feel tipsy. And every morning, I woke up with a hangover. I was dehydrated all the time and having kidney pain. I was super unhealthy and starting to feel it.

Now, I have more energy every day. My depression and anxiety are better. I took the money I saved from not drinking and got myself to a doctor for some Prozac. I lost 25 lbs. I am a better cat/dog parent. I am more present for my work, my friends, my family, and my fiancee. Quitting drinking was one of the best things I could have done for myself, as well as the people around me.

I won't lie, the urge to go have a beer is especially strong around this time of year, but I've been fortunate enough to have the strength and emotional support of my family to help me through my rough days. Never be afraid to reach out to those around you. I was so afraid of being judged by those closest to me that I hid my drinking for too long before getting help. Now? Well they all know, and they all support me in my sober journey.

Just thought I'd share my experience here. I hope you are well. Be kind to yourself, and stay strong.",72,0

From what I hear is that he didn’t always drink and that he was okay at a point. I was at the age of 12 when he started and now I am 26. All his money goes to alcohol, cigarettes, and the lottery. The hardest thing is is that he is a functioning alcoholic. He will drink peach vodka with a drop of coke then go to work the next morning. 

        It has effected my family really badly throughout the years. I am the only one who moved out out of my three other siblings. My eldest sister who is 35 chooses to stay because she really doesn’t want to leave my mother with my father. My older brother is depressed at the age of 30 and hasn’t had a job in 10 years. My youngest sister is a single mother who is also dealing with depression. 

         I just feel like this has gone for too long and everyone is stuck. They all feel hopeless and miserable. My mom is just sick of it I know she is. He treats my mother like crap. He actually treats everyone like crap. None of us have a relationship with him. He’s chosen booze over his family. He is at the age of 61 with no savings, no retirement, and he hates his job. He grew up with a terrible father so I am assuming that’s why he can’t really be a good father. 
        
        My question is, is he a lost cause? Should I just let this go on? I can’t sleep at night sometimes because I just have this run through my head. How do you help someone who isn’t willing to change? He will never reach rock bottom because he functions okay at work and has family who is there for him.

I've been doing better. I am able to go through spouts of sobriety for about a month at a time. It's nice. But then I get bored. Staying subscribed on here(on my main username) usually helps enough. But then I stop paying attention. I purposely just scroll past these posts on my feed. And I start drinking for anywhere between 2-5 days at a time. Sometimes more. Easily putting down 15+ drinks minimum a day. Usually 25+

The last few years I've been on my own. Nobody to help. I've worked my way up into a government job without a degree. It doesn't pay much. Still, I'm doing pretty well for not having a degree. To top it off, I'm going to school full-time and am probably going to finish my informatics degree by next December. All while working full-time. I recently got a new condo too. It's a mess in this place but considering I've set it all up myself, I don't *think* I should feel guilty.

But I do. I always feel guilty. Why did I spend 8 years in the Navy just to get out and live a ""normal"" life? All for what? Now I'm thirty and doing worse than most people I went to high-school with. Except for the drug addicts.

So then I fall back into drinking. And I feel like the next time I do it'll be my last because I'll either be dead or I'll completely fuck up my job and/or degree, or both, somehow. The fact that I can drink more on my long binges than some of the people I see on here or CA and I don't get in trouble? It's just a time bomb waiting to happen.

I respect you guys a lot and appreciate you being on here and telling it how it is, though.

So what do you guys think after my stupid little rant? Do we alcoholics get addicted to that guilty feeling? To the rush of trouble? All I know is I get bored and then decide it's time to drink again. Almost like the last time wasn't enough of a wake up call.",5,0

I start getting upset and I’m not sure if I have a right to be. Booze was the worst thing that she has ever been around she tells me but she goes out drinking? I’m doing great with my recovery but I still have off days here and there with my thoughts and I share them with her for support. She saw me at my worse and saw me get better and I feel like if there’s anyone in the world I can depend on it’s her. But I feel like that’s all gone now. Let me clarify she has never been a big drinker and she doesn’t have a problem so I shouldn’t be pissed at her, I HAVE the problem not her. 

She likes to remind me sometimes that if I drink again she is done with me completely.... fine I get it. But what the fuck it’s okay for her to go out drinking? Idk, I just figured we had an unspoken agreement... 

Then she gets home, and I go outside to smoke and I see her through the windows pulling off the classic booze bag tricks. Downing water, stuffing her mouth with cookies, and a nice mouthwash rinse. I finally go in and I see her eyes glazed over and I ask “what’s wrong with your eyes?” 

This moment right here I decided if this is going to be an issue or if I’m going to just shrug it off and forget about it. It all depends on her answer and honesty. She goes “what? Nothing, I’m just tired”... yet another classic move.

I ask why I smell an intense amount of Perfume and “ew what else is that smell, is that you?”... I’m talking about the smell of booze but playing stupid to give her the chance to just say what it is. She replies “oh I’ve had that on all day weird that you didn’t notice earlier. What smell I don’t smell anything, maybe the trash needs to be taken out or something.”

 I don’t have a thought about drinking currently but I do have (for the first time since getting sober) the feeing of betrayal. I am hurt, I feel lied to, I’m pissed and I’m also question every feeling inside me because like I said, I’m the one with the booze issues not her so part of me feels like I shouldn’t be pissed at all. She was just having fun. But by lying to me about it she showed me that she also believed she was doing something wrong. 

Fuckkk, sorry for the long post I just felt like sharing.",22,0

I am more or less a teetotaler but i have a close friend that grew up with who is an alcoholic. He claims that he rarely gets hung over anymore or maybe that he never did. He drinks between 10 and 20 drinks a day and quite honestly its starting to make him look like hell. Anyways how can he look so terrible and not be hungover or drink that much and not be hungover? Or is he always just hungover and so he doesnt even know what normal is?

I only really drink in social situations. I rarely drink weeknights and never on my own. I also could go weeks and not think about alcohol or be tempted to drink it. For me it’s a social thing, at events or for dinner or a gathering. 

Here’s the problem. Because I don’t drink that much that often, it doesn’t take much for me to get a buzz. Sometimes I drink to the point of blacking out and I wake up the next day forgetting half the night. It happened nearly every weekend in college, and multiple times a month in university.

I’m a married 27 year old (F) and since graduating (2016) it’s happened far less. But it’s still happening. Now it happens 1-3 times per year.

I think part of why I drink too much is due to social anxiety and wanting to fit in and keep up with everyone else. Sometimes I drink with people that are heavy drinkers / partiers that are likely not a good influence, encouraging me to take shots or keep up. But I also get blackout drunk with some of my closet friends. It seems to all link back to comfort in a way and wanting to fit in. 

I have had some non-clinical anxiety and depression since I was a teenager and definitely had a challenging childhood, self esteem issues etc. Have had moderation issues with food in addition to alcohol. Father was an alcoholic and abused drugs from a young age. I visit a counsellor multiple times a year, meditate often but not daily, workout and try to maintain balance in most of my life otherwise. But I’ve never sought help for alcoholism in particular, although it’s come up. 

The biggest reason I am considering going sober is for my marriage. I’ve said some terrible things to my husband over the years when I’ve been blackout drunk and have gotten myself into bad situations. We have been together 10 years (high school sweethearts) and he is the most forgiving person I know. He has seen me blackout so many times and my mood is always so unpredictable in those moments. He sees that I’m trying and refuses to give up on me. And I don’t want to give up on myself, I know I can get past this but I need help. 

Part of why it’s hard is that I truly enjoy social drinking when I don’t take it too far. I love supporting local craft breweries and my husband and I bond over sharing flights so much. 

TLDR; Can someone that only abuses alcohol in social situations learn moderation and control their drinking? Or is it best to go sober and avoid the possibility of taking it too far altogether?

We bonded over some shared life circumstances which we helped each other through and well, one thing led to another, and despite us both being married and on other sides of the world from each other, we have recently professed our love for each other. All good so far right ..

Well my worry is that over the last few weeks she confessed to having a serious drinking problem, so bad in fact that she’s lost control of it, she’s just lost her job and lousy dead marriage ( co-dependency I think) because of it. She's checked herself into a rehab program a couple of days after we exchanged those magical loaded 3 words to each other. She’s promised to get better to me (not for me - which I don’t think would be healthy)

Now I HAVE to do the right thing by her, as her health and life is much more important to me than my own happiness or any relationship we might or might not have in the future. Before she went in, I told her that if during rehab she decides that our online relationship is not healthy or good for her, then I’m OK with that, she comes first. ( she replied OK) . I have been reading about the treatments and behavioural therapy etc. that goes on, and I'm thinking she may come out of the program a completely different person ?

I’m considering leaving my marriage for this girl, if things continue to work out between us ( trip being planned to meet asap after Covid) , but her alcoholism has me worried for our future and her recovery.

Surely starting\\continuing a newish relationship must be a huge risk factor for a recovering alcoholic fresh out of rehab ? To say im nervous, waiting to see how we are together when she comes out is a massive understatement !

If i'm being honest, I had a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol as I was finishing my Senior year of college, and going off-campus back to my hometown has probably left my liver thanking me. Ive cut back my drinking dramatically, from consistently blacking out 3-4 nights in a week and day drinking, to a couple drinks here and there with the occasional exception.

Last night was one of them. It's my 22nd birthday Tuesday so I visited my older brother this weekend to hang out and take some stress off of studying for exams, and got pretty drunk last night while exploring some outdoor bars. I didnt black out, but I woke up this morning feeling awful, and ive been hungover and tired all day. I had a drink or two earlier today, but really just to fit in. Now Im sitting in bed (well im couch surfing) experiencing a lovely anxiety attack and Im wondering if this is normal.

I'm a ""fun"" party animal that people come to for a good time. I was drinking maybe 10 pints on a night out, a lot but I was fine with it. 

Then things changed. A year and a half ago I got a new job in the banking sector. My pay went to a level I never thought it could. I started drinking more as I could afford it, I could afford to drink every day constantly without worry. I grew up poor in a family of addicts to alcohol and drugs. I thought I was above it until that job. 

So the stereotypes about banking and cocaine are true. I never thought I'd take a hard drug but that turned out to be a false assumption. I'd get drunk, insanely blackout drunk, and then people would get out the cocaine. It's fine I thought, I'm not paying so it's not that bad.

Then last night happened. To be blunt I ended up paying a lot of money for three prostitutes and took a shit tonne of cocaine with them. If I weren't drinking I'd have been at home, safe, hanging out with friends. Instead I went out with my alcoholic friends and ended up in a part of the world I only had seen in films. 

So yeah, I'm an alcoholic with a serious problem. It's not even the health effects I worry about most right now, though I should. I worry about what I've become. I'm not just as bad as my family - I'm worse, by a long margin.

Over the last 5 years, I started to notice that he would drink way too much and would get violently ill. I’m talking, vomiting for 12 hours the next day and not wanting to do anything due to how bad he feels. I would be able to see he was pushing it way too far, and when I would gently ask him to slow down he’d get mad or just not listen. The vomit typically lands on the floor/carpet, whether we are at home, staying with family, or in a hotel. I’m not sure if the level of intoxication has anything to do with that. 

This situation started happening once every six months. It is now happening more and more frequently. We had a group camping trip a few weeks ago and we discussed self control with drinking for the week in advance. He still ended up puking and sick after the first night. After that, we had another serious conversation about control. He told me he understood why I was upset and would make an effort to not push his limits. Tonight, I came downstairs and he he’s sick on the couch, only to find out that he had “one too many.” 

He insists he doesn’t have a problem, however his lack of self control for a man nearly 30 years old and the disregard for the fact he’s going to be violently ill, really makes me think otherwise. He has a strong family history of alcoholism on his moms side, including his mother who cannot maintain a job due to her drinking. 

He told me tonight that things will be different this time, because he’s going to stop drinking all together, but the fact that he thinks he won’t be able to slow down unless alcohol isn’t acutely available to him only makes me think he has a problem more. I just don’t see why he can’t stop after he’s had a few if there’s not an issue. 

I don’t know if I’m over reacting, because this is definitely not a daily occurrence, but this issue is clearly popping up more and more frequently. I keep hearing promises about how this won’t happen again, just to be disappointed.",2,0

I’ve been drinking regularly since I was 15. It’s been a great solution to the feelings of abandonment, worthlessness, and general self-loathing. My mom passed away two years ago and I had to perform CPR on her while I kept my younger brother out of the room she collapsed in. I drink to forget that. I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I drink to not face that. I got attached to my roommates and was diagnosed with BPD after 4 or 5 stays in Psych in 4 months. I drink to avoid that. I have scars from cutting the crap out of myself. I drink to ignore that.

But most importantly I drink because it makes me feel better. I’m relaxed. I’m happy. I’m honest. Before I drank tonight I wasn’t going to feed myself. I am now drunk and I made myself dinner. Sure my apartment’s smokey, but I did an adult thing and took care of myself. When I drink I’m better. It’s the oddest thing to explain, but drinking helps me sleep, ease my turmoil, achieve purpose, and gives me hope. Maybe it’s because I grew up drinking, or maybe it’s just how my brain is, but I’m doing better. At least I think I’m doing better.

Everyone I know was upset when I went back to drinking, but I don’t know how to tell them that it isn’t the stereotypical image of alcohol abuse they have in mind. I’m whole when I am drinking. It’s how I developed I think. 

I know it can’t be good when other people are involved, so I’ve made sure it’s just me in this. My family disowned me for other reasons. I moved from my roommates’ place. I don’t date—for several reasons. It’s just me. I’m not hurting anyone and I’m doing well. I refuse to drink and drive. I drink to survive and now that I’m on my own, I’m not hurting anyone.

I’m just tired of people telling me how disappointed they are in me, “going back to (my) old ways.” They don’t understand.

Couldn't and went back to grab the cart before someone else got the money, totally panic stricken.  Suddenly our VP appeared pushing the cart back to help me out with all the money still there.  He placed 2 draft beers in glasses for me to chug on the spot to calm down and 2 bottled beers to drink later.  I remembered I had stopped drinking but was flipping out so I immediately drank the draft beers and remember the feeling when the alcohol hit my bloodstream. I realized I had blown it but my anxiety was so high I didn't care.

Woke up later was convinced I had drank once again for real.  Scared the shit out of me.

Later remembered it was just a dream and I was cool.  Had watched a action thriller the day before that was a bank heist where they were transporting a lot of money.

Also realized I had lost my shopping cart a couple days earlier at Walmart.

The VP at the company I worked for knew I was an alcoholic but liked me for the work I had done.  He invited me over to his house to celebrate one of my anniversaries at work.

I posted yesterday about withdrawal symptoms in my husband while trying to stop at home. We took him to the ER and he is now medically detoxing at a very good hospital. 

I visited him today and they had him on Valium, he was still shaky and kept getting out of bed despite the nurses telling him to lay down. He seemed out of it, but not sure if that was from the Valium. A few hours after I left he texted me telling me he needed to come home he ""didn't think this was going to work out"" because they transferred him to a private room that scared him for some reason (it has padded walls, which I think made him paranoid, but it was the first private room because the person he was sharing with was yelling a lot and trying to leave, etc..)

Then about 6 hours later he texted me and told me the nurse was crazy and was experimenting on him. To pick him up in the morning ASAP and tell them we have a medical emergency. 

I spoke with the nurse and they hadn't changed anything. She spoke with him and he seemed to understand and say ""everything was fine"". He then texted me and asked ""why I told them that"". They are trying to keep him calm. He sounds like he is doing really well, otherwise- vitals etc. but sweaty, shakes, confusion at times. They said the withdrawal can peak around this time to 72 hours. They mentioned delirium. I researched it online and I'm terrified now. 

I don't know how the next 24 hours are going to play out with him and I'm worried he is going to try to leave if his symptoms get worse and then have a seizure or drink, and then our insurance won't cover the hospital stay since he walked out, etc...

I am really concerned about his mental state and now wondering how long he is going to be there. I can't be with him right now because the hours are so limited form Covid. He will be alone until 4pm tomorrow (it's 1:30am).

What would you say to someone in this state, he isn't all there right now. I told him he has to stay and I will be there tomorrow and told him once he gets through this he will be on the other end safely and will feel so much better. 

Anyone been through medical detox after drinking heavily? Is it normal to try and leave? Try to get your spouse to pick you up? What do I do if he keeps insisting on me picking him up? How long do symptoms last in a medical detox? 

He didn't realize how hard this is either. I think he thought it would be a quick thing (in the ER he said he wanted to go out to dinner the next day since my mom was watching the kids and staying with me to help while he detoxes...) like hours and then go home so he was not prepared for this AT ALL.",3,1

Context:

- Drank 12 beers daily for 5 years
- Drinking would escalate during negative events
- His old room mates do not want him living with them anymore
- Refuses to say at parents rent free
- Trying to move back in with people who don't want him)

Long story short my husband of 10 years has a sever drinking problem. Goes in cycles and every few years it's escascalates to the point he can't stop because the withdrawal symptoms are so bad. Hiding drinking, drinking in the car with our kids, alone in the car, at work, sometimes in the middle of the night. 

I realized what was going on recently and told him he has to get help this time or I have to take our kids out of this situation. He is a great guy, and he knows he has to stop, wants to and his worried for his health- but I just am worried with my kids being in a home like this. 

He made an appointment with a doctor (Phone/virtual) and the doctor told him he can't prescribe medication for withdrawal. He told him to wean off, drink half a beer instead of a whole beer etc...which I don't understand because he is not in a good state.

He is shaky and naseuous this morning, and looks and feels sick. He is supposed to get bloodwork done today. 

I'm unsure if my husband was completely honest with him or not about the level of drinking or not. 

I guess what I'm wondering is...is this normal protocol to tell someone who can't control their drinking to wean and to not prescribe some sort of medication or a detox center? Do they wait for lab results? It's confusing and worrisome.",4,0

I have wanted him to stop being so dependent on alcohol for the entirety of our relationship. But he continues to make compromises, excuses, bargains, and flat out broken promises in order to justify continue drinking. He also full heartedly believes he can be a recovered alcoholic while occasionally or socially drinking. 
I have tried to reason with him but he is incredibly stubborn. He refuses to go to rehab, and his probation officer doesn't want to do the paperwork to force him to go. His longest streak of sobriety has been a week. He tries to tell me that his drinking has gotten better. Comparatively yes it has...he was downing 1-2 liters of vodka a day. Now maybe a 30 pack every two days. 
I have taken him to counseling,  but he doesn't open up. just makes a lot of small talk. (I've sat in on a few sessions per his request). I have taken him to AA and Celebrate Recovery but he doesn't work the program. Only goes because it's mandatory for probation.

At what point does someone finally say enough is enough? 

The most recent event in his life made me think he would finally change his life. He was hospitalised for over a month in the ICU because he attempted suicide. He made that decision while drunk, and family was refusing to give him more. He overdosed on medication. He went into cardiac arrest multiple times, had severe grad mal seizures, and required intubation and later a tracheostomy. Developed bloodclots, cdiff; pneumonia and brachial nerve injury. Was comotose for the entire time and we were being asked to consider a DNR and palliative care. No one thought he would be functional if he woke up, do to the big possibility of anoxic brain damage. Well against ALL odds he woke up. He woke up agitated at first but he woke up and regain all motor function and cognitive awareness. 
Now he can walk, talk, feed himself, and actually a week ago we went on a 6 mile hike up the mountains! This was something no one, thought would ever happen. A miracle by any extent of the word. 
 

Yet he continues to drink. when he was medically stable they put him in a psychiatric unit for observation. there he was drinking hand sanitizer behind the nursing staff's back. Once he got home after being hospitalised for almost 2 months, he went and got himself some liquor. So my question is- someone who has been severely addicted,  what finally made u decide enough is enough and u want to change ??",18,0

She helps everyone without waiting for anything in return. She is really sweet and caring, but she has no courage. She is TOO SOFT. 

        My dad was, is and will always be an alcoholic. He was a verbal abuser when I was in high school, but back then he was a rather functioning alcoholic, because he went to work. In the last couple of years, his drinking became worse. He was on antidepressants as an effect to his drinking problem which lead to depression, and you SHOULD NEVER combine these pills with alcohol. My father did and the last couple of years have been horrible. He got in 3 car accidents, he stole some money, he started not going to work, started being a verbal, but also physical abuser with my mother.  
    
           Because she is afraid of a fresh start or to leave him, because he might be dangerous, she is just enabling his behaviour. I always tell her that me and my sister could help her, she could move in the same city we are going to college in and help one another, so she would get away from this monster who ruined my childhood and keeps on going. 

           I can’t deal with the stress he’s been putting us on, of everyday thinking that he might beat my mother to death.I feel like I am this close to suffering from a mental disorder if she keeps on enabling him...

Can I please get some help.,"Well... I’m in a weird place. I’ve always had a bit of a drinking problem, but it didn’t get bad until a move across the country and was just bored, found a lot of friends through drinking and drugs, ended up moving back home for work and the daily drinking turned into binge drinking. I can almost go two weeks without alcohol, but then I convince myself that it’s okay and end up drinking until I black out. 

Realized recently I can’t do this on my own because so many people around me drink and living alone helps take some of the accountability out of quitting.  

I’m not ready to go to AA, don’t know if I ever will, but would I need some help to get me there.  Like someone to just text me each day ask me if I drank anything? Or someone to talk to when the urges get bad?

I don’t know if that’s what this group is for, if not happy to delete this post, but really hoping to go at least a couple months if not a year.  Would appreciate any help.",1,0

I didn’t know if I was depressed because I was drinking, or drinking because I was depressed.

ANTIDEPRESSANTS SAVED MY LIFE.

It took me years to build up the courage to ask my doctor about it. I tried to play it off like I just needed anti anxiety pills, hoping that would help me. Instead I broke down in tears and started having a panic attack in front my doctor. We put me on antidepressants and it saved my life. 

Every day, almost every moment I would be asking “why? or what?” “What is the point of all this?” Why are we here?” “I don’t understand and I don’t want to be here anymore. It’s pointless. I’m worthless.”

I so badly wanted to kill myself and the only thing that kept me from doing it was thinking of how awful my friends and family would feel if I did.

Years went by of me thinking these thoughts. Hiding my crying from my boyfriend. Everyday was a struggle to get out of bed. Everyday was a struggle to not crash my car when I drove. Everyday was a struggle to put on a happy face. The only thing that made me feel better was drinking. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. One night I drank to much and put a whole bottle of sleeping pills in my mouth. I grabbed my beer to swallow them but instead I accidentally knocked it over, spilling it everywhere. I took that as a sign and spit out the pills. 

The next day I made an appointment with my doctor. 

I’m still drinking, but not nearly as much. I haven’t had any bad thoughts for about two months. I hadn’t even noticed that I wasn’t thinking that way anymore until I saw it was suicide prevention day. 

So if you’re like me, and you want to give up. If everything seems pointless. Please, give yourself a chance and try antidepressants. I hope it will help you as much as it helped me. And remember, you are not worthless, the world is not better off without you, and you are loved. I love you. Hang in there.

TLDR- if you’re giving up, try antidepressants. They saved my life. I love you, don’t give up.",18,0

So probably somewhere between 10-15 drinks 6 nights a week. In the last year or so, I have noticed that my legs feel week, kind of shaky. Climbing a small flight of stairs is doable, but my legs feel week and shaky. I have also put on about 50 pounds, so I don't think it's the typical malnourishment. I know I should have tapered off but I didn't. The first few days I felt hot, sweaty and overall bad. Fast forward 11 days, my legs are still feeling weak and shaky. I had an EMG recently for an unrelated reason, so I know I don't have nerve damage. There was also no permanent muscle ""damage"" in my legs which is good I guess. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced the weak legs feeling toward the end of their drinking and early recovery. If so, did it go away? How long did it take, etc.

During quarantine I was absolutely miserable, we would fight every other day, my boyfriend loves to be social everything kind of shut out bc of quaratine. he was working from home, he couldn’t go to any bars with his friends, he always at his house drinking


Months into quarantine, he shared that’s once he started living alone he would drink a 12 pack or more a night and he starting to grow to hate his job even more and more, he also said that he was so hung over once that he threw up blood, and I heard that was a huge sign that someone was on the way to becoming alcoholic (April)

he “cut back” drinking ever since that happened but he still drank consistently and tonight he was really angry about his job and there wasn’t really anything I could do to make him feel better, he’s looking for liquor stores that were open and they were all closed and he said he would shoot himself if he didn’t get any alcohol, He found one that was open and literally sped there to get some beer, right after we came back and he drank some alcohol he was completely better

I know that sometimes people have hard days but my concern has grown more, and to add to all of this, his dad is an alcoholic

I just don’t know what to do, I feel like whenever he drinks we fight more and he couldn’t handle a night without it because of his anger, I feel like that shows some dependency

In the beginning of a relationship I didn’t think it was my place to say anything but it turned out to be true because he threw up blood, should I follow a premonition and say something to him? Is it my place? Everyone around him drinks, so it seems like he’s fine, but I’ve been around a lot of people and no one I know drinks like him",4,2

Stopped and started maybe a few times but not super frequently, at this point the last time I drank was about 4 months ago. 

On that occasion I had 2 beers on 2 consecutive nights and after I stopped I got withdrawals on days 2-3 afterwards with anxiety and heart stuff and just a ton of general misery. So that’s it right?

(/advice on quitting / with withdrawal?),"I decided just saying I'm going to try isn't enough, and since yesterday I've quit. My target is not drinking for at least the next few months, and if I ever start again, it'll be strictly social. But in all honesty I think I may just be telling myself it's not permanent to make the first few days or weeks a bit easier on the mental side of it.

I used to drink at home just for the feeling. Life felt more fun with alcohol, and because I used to be alone I didn't see any problems. But since then, I've come to realise alcohol affects those around me so much more than me, and if I can't do it for myself I need to do it for them, and although I can lie to myself I can't bring myself to lie to them. 

I used to drink between 4.5 and 9 units basically every day, and on benders I'd drink 15+ units in one night, that was usually about once every two or three weeks. Rinse and repeat from about March this year until now (thanks quarantine, taking everything and leaving nothing but video games and alcohol). I didn't think I was a heavy drinker until I looked at the numbers. Plus the sheer prospect of how much money I'll save from quitting is like a bribe to myself lol.

Now it's been about 40 hours since my last drink and I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I never considered them for some reason, I guess I thought I didn't drink enough (dumbass I was). I've got the anxiety, headaches, increased heart rate, I think insomnia is coming on (but idk because I did sleep for a few hours in the day). I don't think they're severe, but I need to ask: should I seek help in quitting? I really don't want to think I need it, it's only been a few months and the symptoms right now don't seem extreme, although the anxiety did make me take a mental health day from work, but I don't want to play the brave face and end up accidentally endangering myself or others. If it matters, I'm 20 (legal in my country, so I don't have to worry about the legality of seeking help if it's necessary).

Sorry if it's a bit of a ramble, I'm finding it hard to concentrate. Please let me know if you have any advice!",6,1

It helped me in a way nothing else has, and I hope you’ll listen, because this has helped me go from rock bottom to where I am now. 

First, my background: I started drinking on weekends in my 20’s and around 2014 it began to happen daily.  My early 2016 I realized I was in a vicious cycle where I was either drunk or hungover, and eventually it reached the point that my eyes turned yellow.  I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis.  A healthy leaves of bilirubin is 1-2.  Mine was 17.  I detoxed and was sent home vowing to never drink again.  Cut to two and a half years later, when I really felt I had it under control, not having drank in 31 months, when I decided I could drink in moderation.  It didn’t work and almost overnight I spiraled straight back into that cycle, only worse.  I made a point not to drink on the clock (I work from home because of Covid) but was basically drunk every other minute of the day.  I kept trying and trying to stop and I’d make it about a day and start again.  The rational part of me knew I had to stop or I would die, but it felt like there something in my head that I called “The Parasite” that felt like it had hijacked my brain and made me drink.  My anxiety went through the roof (which was basically alcohol withdrawal), my depression got worse, and finally I started having suicidal thoughts.  I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare that I couldn’t escape.

Reading r/alcoholism, someone recommended a book called This Naked Mind by Annie Grace, and I ordered it off Amazon.  The book is about how to break free so that not only do you stay sober, you don’t even want to drink.  The main things the book focuses on are:

1.  Your brain has a conscious and subconscious side.  When you struggle with alcoholism your conscious brain is telling you that you need to stop and your subconscious, which has been programmed for years by everything from the addictive qualities of alcohol to how society has normalized it, is telling you drink.  The goal is to reprogram your subconscious so it views alcohol not as what you need, but as a poison that shouldn’t be in your life.
2.   Alcohol is an addictive drug and anyone, no matter who they are, can become addicted.  It is not a character flaw.  Everyone who drinks is on the same downward slope, it’s just that some people are further down it than others, and a few people are able to hold onto the side of the slope, but the more you drink the more your tolerance builds and the further down you slide.  The author brings up an example: she was on the Vegas strip once and saw a homeless man begging for money holding a bottle of cheap liquor in a paper bag and saw a few drunk guys on their 20’s holding their yard-long drinks give him money, laughing and having fun and seeing him as “other people” and something that would never happen to them, unaware they were on the same downward slope, just further up it than the homeless drunk.
3.  Normal methods of staying sober like AA leave the person in a mindset where all they think about it being sober, and it’s a miserable life spending your entire life focusing every day on fighting cravings.  There is so much to focus on in life that is wonderful, and if you spend your whole life focusing on staying sober, always thinking about it, that’s not a way to live.  
4.  The goal is to make it so you don’t spend every day saying “I can’t drink” but instead “I don’t want to drink.”

I read the entire book in one night, and I it changed my entire mindset.  The author also has an online website and a YouTube channel where she answers questions about alcoholism and sobriety.  If you are struggling with alcohol and feel like you are trapped, please please please order this book.  It changed everything about how I handle staying sober

It's when the conversation casually goes to this kind of subject, I feel compelled to lie about my alcohol consumption because I feel like I would sound like an alcoholic within my interlocutor's frame of reference.

Anyway :

* I often drink alone, 2 half liter beers, after work if I am stressed out. Like 2 or three times a week.
* I don't mind drinking alone at the bar while waiting for a friend.
* When meeting people, I almost always go at the bar. And I always drink, in average 1 pint every 45 minutes.
* I don't mind drinking early, sometimes at noon or in the beginning of the afternoon. Just a glass of wine or a beer, though

On the other hand :

* I feel in control of my alcohol consumption, feels more like a pleasure to me.
* I rarelly, if never, get wasted. I don't drink strong alcohol.
* I can spend a couple days without drinking and I don't physically miss it. Although I rarely go more than 1 day or 2 without drinking at least a beer.

I have had a drinking problem I believe for many years. My mom drank all my life and would give me sips of her drinks when I was young. We are talking like 8 year old me having little drinks with my mom. When I was a teenager I dont think I was sober for most of the week. I remember going to school in the morning with a huge hangover and my parents not thinking otherwise. I knew in the back of my head I had a problem in my 20s but it was hard for me to tell anyone. Who would believe that you started drinking with your mom at the age of 8?! I was sexually assaulted at 22, my self worth became so incredibly low i was drinking daily and having sex with random guys i just met..not my finest moment. This last year I was in a very abusive relationship. I used alcohol to escape what was happening to me and being called vile names. I would drink an entire bottle of vodka while my ex was at work just so I could calm my nerves and sleep. A few months ago I left that relationship. It was so hard and unfortunately sent me into a massive spiral. I was drinking the biggest bottles of vodka at the store-1.75L in one night...there was maybe enough for 2 drinks in the bottle when I was done. I woke up on my couch covered in vodka and coke with my food burning in the oven. I could have burnt my place down. I started a new job when I left my relationshiop and moved back to my family. Ive felt its been too much to hold down a job with trauma and coping while using alcohol. I broke down crying at work because a male staff yelled at me for not typing something the right way. I'm tired of being walked over. I'm tired of being insecure. I'm tired of not having control. 
I started getting therapy through a domestic violence shelter and learning about myself and the way I cope with things. Ive been practicing mindfulness and being in the present frame of mind. Harder than it sounds when you constantly live in your past wishing you could change things. I havent had a drink now for 2 weeks which is a huge step for me. I will admit that I do use Marijuana but I will take that small success anyways because I believe I would have died before 30 if I do keep drinking. I'm dealing with my anxiety at the moment and having a problem with dissociating when I'm with people. My therapist says that its normal after trauma and having ptsd. Its been really hard for me to share this story since most people in my life do not know the real me. Thank you guys for listening.",15,0

So I am just saying that it was prescribed to ease drinking but now I know if I up the dose to about 1800-2400mg in a day I can get away without paying the price of a horrible hangover and not trying to get the elusive diazepam which should be noted that diazepam tolerance has gone up since the use of Gabapentin it doesn’t really get me high like it used to (or low as it is a downer). 
    Just curious if anyone else has notice this affect to get through a hangover and sober up. 
    Might I note this is a good thing to get sober as it works but if it is serious Diazepam is still the gold standard. Also I do not need to hear how about how this is drug abuse and what not my Psychiatrist knows what I have done and says yes it can help.",0,0

235,2020-09-05 13:39:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/in5bz6/its_harder_to_stop_the_second_time/,It's harder to stop the second time.,"So, I posted in here about 3 months ago about my carefully considered return to drinking which perhaps unsurprisingly has ultimately been a 6 month full on relapse (following 3.5 years of sobriety).

Today is day 3 off the booze. I have been drinking so much that I have had to spend 3 weeks tapering down from up to 50 units per day to 0. 

I have only recently become aware of kindling which I have inadvertently been doing all year. Thinking that I was doing a good thing binging then stopping abruptly for a period. Initially I didn't understand why I was getting more and more severe withdrawals each time. 

This last time even as I was tapering (too quick to start with) I was almost at the point of having full on DTs at times and am pretty sure I was having some sort of seizures in the night for the first week. I almost went to hospital one night and was afraid to go to sleep. I was frightened how severe and horrible the withdrawals could get. 

However, through progressive tapering, good nutrition, supplimentation, daily exercise and discipline, I am now finally alcohol free once more. 

It's been so much harder to muster the will to do it this time. Last time, I was determined and nothing was going to get in my way. In effect, I pulled myself out of addiction.
This time, it's as though I have been pushed out of it by the frightening effect this poison has had on me and my complete inability to control my drinking.

It's early days but I've got a plan and I intend to stick to it. 

A major reason I failed last time was I didn't connect enough with others so I am trying to address that issue this time. I guess I'm writing this to make myself accountable to my decision and as a warning to those of you who have been sober long enough for the bad wolf to be whispering in your ear that you can control it. 

I can't and I've got a lot of work to do to get back to where I was but at least I know now. 

Thanks for reading this and good luck to you all.

If anyone wants to reach out I'd be happy to hear from you.

He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict.

Adam had the best laugh. It was loud & boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn’t too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.

As time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane.

My brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.

He became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again.

This time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn’t use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn’t recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he’d make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.

Surely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset.

We never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren’t looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it.

In the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.

This harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don’t have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.
Of course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others?

There is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he’d overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I’d be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.

I spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I’d take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he’d make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls.

Most importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I’d look back with regret.

Something I wasn’t prepared for was how permanent death is.

He flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother.

I wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.

I want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.
To those of you in the beginning stages of grief… hold on. I know you feel like you’re drowning and can’t catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath.

Please, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it.

Cry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let’s be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won’t cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you’re feeling in the moment.

To anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It’s been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can.

Addiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It’s easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone’s family member or best friend. All I’m saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person.

To families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It’s a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it’s embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It’s something that unfortunately happens way more than it should.

To those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.

And to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.

I mean, I was already wasted when I showed up and then proceeded to drink all the drinks. I was a hot mess and ran my mouth off to a near and dear friend. He reacted very angrily. Literally yelling in my face. I started crying, apologizing over and over. Repeating myself like a drunken fool. My fiancé pulled me out of the party and drove me home. He yelled at me the entire way home. Both men are really reasonable, kind people. I must have said something unbelievably bad for both of them to react that way. I don’t even know what I said...

I’m so incredibly embarrassed this morning. I’m hungover as hell and the shakes are already starting. I’m so mad at myself. I was doing so good with my drinking and now here I am sitting in my car, trying to decide if I should force myself to be productive or go find mimosas somewhere.

Why do I do this? I don’t get it. I know alcoholism and addiction are diseases but I can’t help but feel I’m choosing this. I chose to pick up the bottle last night. I chose to continue drinking. I’m making a choice now of what my day is going to look like. I keep thinking it’s going to get better and I keep choosing bad decisions. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I don’t know if I need support, harsh words, to be told it’s going to be ok... I just know I need help. I can’t do this anymore

238,2020-09-05 09:33:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/in16c8/watched_good_movie_last_night/,Watched good movie last night,"A movie called The Way Back which came out this year. It stars Ben Affleck and is about a separated father who lost his son to an illness. 'Jack' is an industrial worker who drinks constantly throughout the day and night. He gets recruited to be head coach of the high school basketball for which he was a state all star. He turns around a group of players to send them to the state championship. However alcohol was always there and he relapses hard where he loses his job during the playoffs. He can't seem to kick alcohol until he enters rehab. Jack has anger and resentment of the past and present and until he deals with the resentment and anger, he is prone to relapse.

There is a load of swearing in the movie as well as scenes of Jack's drinking and driving. I found the movie to be well made as it highlights what many alcohol sufferers are experiencing and can relate to. The movie is sobering, realistic and at times, depressing. It does have a good ending though. Jack hits his rock bottom and comes out ok at the end. It has good ratings from critics and viewers. It was time well spent after I finished up work and had a couple of hours before sleepy time.",9,0

I don't want to totally blame the virus for it, nor want to bore people that are already reading with the details.

Depression hit hard, something that probably was coming for a long time now, but apparently all that happened was the last drop for it to effect me, and it did. It did hard enough that I returned to drinking, and god I can't stop.

The only times I felt alive again was when I was drunk to the point of not remembering anything the other day.   
I had to maintain that feeling, so I started using rubbing alcohol. Not pure, obviously. I mixed it with juice and/or water. It felt terrible, the hangovers were 100x worst, everytime I woke up I felt dead, but in my head it was the only answer to stop my parents from discovering and to maintain my getting drunk routine. Just today, as I was about to drink again, I saw how I was just throwing my life away, again. And that I needed help. I'm too ashamed to ask for help irl, so that's the reason i'm here.

He used to have a drinking problem but he managed to stay sober for a few years, and recent events has caused him drink again.

He repeatedly tells me he feels horrible about it and wants to stop, and i believe he truly does - he just lacks the will. He seems to be struggling to set his mind straight to go cold turkey and it is really affecting me as well. Everyday i struggle to stay hopeful and i feel like I'm running out of ways to encourage and support him in this journey towards sobriety. I feel sad and disappointed every time he drinks, and i keep these feelings from him because i don't want him to feel worse about himself. 

The distance between us makes this harder because i cannot be with him and help him deal with his negative thoughts. When a person is left alone with his negative thoughts, the likelihood of engaging in self destructive behaviour is higher. It's just easier to take the easy way out, than to try and change things...

I know that only he can truly convince himself to stop drinking, and i want him to do so for himself, not for me. 

Am wondering if anyone else has faced similar struggles and could offer advice on how i can handle this situation and help him better...",3,0

Basically, my mum used to be an alcoholic. When I was growing up she was seemingly always getting drunk. Mum was diagnosed with depression when I was 13ish and she went on meds. After going on the meds mum realised the problem and had the motivation to fix it. Dad took her to get an treatment that affectively made her allergic to alcohol so mum would have to go cold turkey, no more alcohol for her. She struggled a bit at first but she did really well! Dad is a... Lets say complicated person and was never very supportive of mum and is quite critical of everyone in general. 

Well after 4 years and being on this treatment, mum now wanted to try some alcohol to see if she can handle it. I was all for this because I believe in her and yes she has self control issues but I believed in her. Dad, obviously, doesn't. He was very against this idea and kept trying to convince her she was still allergic to alcohol but we all knew it was a lie.

This is where the problem comes in. 

A few days ago, I poured mum a drink (after she asked) and then took the gin up to my room to hide it from her (also after she asked). I then after a while realised that I should probably go to sit with her to drink because in my opinion her alcoholism is less of a problem if you're with a friend. So I wanted to be that friend and had a drink with her (I'm now 19 and of legal drinking age in my country btw). 

I was happy! I didn't need to feel careful talking about alcohol in front of her anymore. I didn't need to feel guilty drinking in front of her anymore. 

But then she asked for another.. I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HER and she understood but I could see her wanting it when I poured her just a glass of tonic water. 

Tomorrow mum goes back to work after a long absence (medical problems that have finally healed enough for her to teach) and considering work was her biggest cause of depression, she is not looking forward to it. She was very active today and her medical problems flared up and she was in pain so to take her mind off of it, I gave her the bottle of gin. I know, I'm dumb and I shouldn't have given her the whole bottle but I was tired as well and didn't want to go down to pour her a glass and it just didn't occur to me.

Well I just went downstairs for supper and found her slurring her words with only about 2 shots worth of gin left in a bottle that was mostly full when I last saw it. 

So, do you have any way to possibly help my mum? I'm going back to uni in a few days and I'm worried about leaving her. 

TLDR: Mum used to be an alcoholic but quit, 4 years later I gave her a G&T and now I'm pretty sure I restarted the problem.",2,0

I lost my partner and best friend due to my alcoholism, which finally prompted me to get clean. She still refuses to talk to me. On top of this, the severe depression that comes with getting clean has pushed my remaining friends away from me. I have resorted to cutting myself off from everyone left in my life in order to avoid bothering them, however this has left me feeling so utterly alone and depressed all I can think about when I'm awake is how badly I wish I was dead. I feel overwhelmed with regret for my past mistakes, with no solution in sight. Even if I'm sober now , it doesn't change the past and it doesn't make me easier to be around. 

&#x200B;

I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have any willpower to do anything I once enjoyed. I don't see the reward of being clean, when it's done nothing but push people farther from me. I used to cope with liquor, so I'm guessing I was more fun to be around. At least then, my friends weren't annoyed with my company. 

Now I'm just a wreck and alone. When will being sober actually make me feel better? ... I'm tired of crying every moment I'm awake. I just want to be free of this prison. And most of all.. I'm so tired of being alone. I know I've made mistakes... and I know I've hurt people, and I  know I'm not perfect.. but I wish someone... would see I'm trying so hard. I'm trying so hard to change and make up for the past.. and yet I'm feeling the world's wrath more than ever....

Has anyone here done detox at one of these psychiatric hospital/facilities? All the web pages are very pretty and make it sound wonderful, but I wonder how this works. For instance:

a) when you do detox, are you doing any other kind of therapy, or just laying there and being monitored for seizures etc.?

I had been drinking two to three beers every day from January to July. Once every 20 days or so, I would drink a bottle of wine or a half a bottle of liquor after a few beers. During this time I had a large bottle of bourbon after several beers in less than 30 minutes one day and i threw up all night, I called my girlfriend terribly drunk after having a whole bottle of jack Daniel's, and I woke up in the morning to go to work after a night of drinking throwing up all over my room. After these three episodes I stopped drinking liqour all together just to keep myself under control. 

When I was a bit younger (between 16-19)I would drink beer with my friends one night a week. We mostly would stay below four beers but sometimes we would do shots or have 8 or 9 beers.

Last year was split between being 19 and 20. The events leading up to this point i have been 19. Then I turned 20 midway through last year and my drinking was very under control. I only had a few beers here and there but they still added up. At the beginning of this year my weight really started to show so I decided to quit drinking completely in order to shave off weight on top of working out. I got down to 147 from being 185 after about 6 months. 

But I started drinking again. It was my 21st birthday recently and I was exposed back to beer. I've been having 5 beers a day since. It has been throughout the day, not all at once. Am I on the verge of becoming truly addicted? I think that I need help because I don't want to  drink any more than I am now. I want to be able to drink beer occasionally, but is this not a good option for me? Anybody that has some words of advice for me, I genuinely appreciate anything that you have to say. Thanks!",2,0

I recently brought up to my girlfriend that I was concerned with her use of alcohol and said that I thought she had a problem. This made her very upset and she refused to believe she had any issues. Her issue, I believe, is not chronic use but the amount she drinks when she decides to.

She has had multiple incidents where she gets totally wasted; falling downstairs, rolling around on the floor, stumbling around someone’s house and knocking things over, and even once she was throwing up and peeing while yelling at me in a bath tub.

She claims that she doesn’t have a problem for a few reasons:

1. She doesn’t chronically drink alcohol. She drinks once or twice a month usually, but when she does she gets drunk.

2. She says that the whole point of drinking is to get really drunk so when she does drink she’s going to drink a lot. I think that’s akin to saying something like the whole point of driving a car is speeding. The point of a substance is not to abuse it.

3. She says that because before she drinks she says that she’s gonna get really drunk or black out it’s not a problem because she said she was going to do that. Again, I think this logic is flawed, just because you say you’re going to abuse something doesn’t mean you’re not abusing it.

I really think she has an issue but she is denying it, and it makes me doubt myself. I don’t want to seem crazy or overbearing or like a stick in the mud. I’m mainly concerned for her safety, I’m scared one day she’ll make a bad decision and really get hurt. I love her and I want to make sure she stays safe.

Do you guys think she has a substance abuse problem? And if so, how do I help her see that she does?",2,0

While I was living with my friends there had been a strict, “No Drinking” policy due to some mental issues I have that were later diagnosed.

Since I’ve been out on my own I’ve gone back to drinking. No one is around for me to bother, I’m out of the environment that made my BPD flare up, and I feel like I have better judgement with drinking now. I refuse to drive during or after drinking. I refuse to get drunk on nights before work. With these rules in place I’m leagues ahead of where I used to be. The only problem is that my tolerance is coming back.

Long story short I was taking lunch in the breakroom at work when a coworker I’m on friendly terms with asked about my new place. He knew I’d been told by a doctor that I was an alcoholic, so he was curious to see if I decided to keep the no drinking rule. I told I didn’t. So naturally he asked how much I was drinking. I disagree with the doctor. Vehemently. But anyways I decided to be honest with my coworker and tell him I started with a beer before bed and now I’m up to four now. But I drink the light stuff with low alcohol content. Cheap and light that’s how I drink. So it’s just tolerance building up. Additionally it helps me sleep. I joked and said I should probably go back to a shot or two of vodka before bed just to save money.

My coworker dropped his smile and simply said, “sounds to me like you’re spiraling.”

I didn’t know what to say other than to laugh it off. I understand how it can look from the outside, but he doesn’t drink and doesn’t get the concept of building tolerance. I don’t know what to think.

I'm back with my parents temporarily and when I moved back in, my mum warned me about some concerning behavior from my younger brother, Michael (he's 28). Michael has a long term girlfriend that he lives with about an hour away from my parents' house. Michael comes back over, maybe once a month, and will spend a night or two here at my parents' house whenever he's off work and his girlfriend is busy.

My parents' recycling comes on Tuesdays. Michael usually stays over on the weekends and by every Tuesday morning after he's left, my mum has noted that the recycling bin is full of beer, wine, and liquor bottles. Not just 2-3 small bottles, but around 20 bottles. We've all tried to have talks with him separately about how often he's drinking and if he's drinking and driving, if his drinking is affecting his work, etc... all of which he denies.

This past weekend, he came back late from somewhere and I heard him talking on the phone in the driveway. When I went to check on him, he was surrounded by several (like 6) empty beer bottles, had 3 more unopened ones, and one in his hand he was currently drinking. I asked him to come inside because it was late and he was talking loudly but he got snippy with me and told me to leave him alone.

My mum also noted the night before that when she came out to get some water before bed, Michael had drank an entire bottle of wine to himself in the 30 minutes between my parents leaving the kitchen and getting ready for bed, to my mom coming back out and getting a drink.

I'm very worried about him and don't know where to refer him to for help, or how to push him to get the help he needs, since he's an adult. I am also tempted to reach out to his girlfriend for some assistance, but I don't really know her that well. I fear that his drinking problem might be much worse than we're aware of since we only see him every few weeks. Any advice or resources you have is really appreciated, thank you.",1,0

I posted this awhile back and forgot about it but I got a lot of really nice support so I wanted to try to bring a little positivity back into this sub. Everything got worse for awhile but now I can confidently say I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. It's been 366 days since I got a DWI, 139 days sober, and 1 day legally driving on the road.

I quit cold turkey. It was the hardest thing I've ever done but it was what worked for me. I just got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I had felt that way for awhile but I was finally ready to do something about it. So I stopped. And somehow I got through my withdrawal and I started learning to not think of it as an option anymore, no matter what my brain told me. And while it told me to buy a bottle every minute for the first 2 months of my sobriety, I didn't ever buy one. Every single day was a tiny tiny bit easier than the last, I just had to keep going. And I don't mean to gloss over this part, it was very difficult. A lot of support among other things contributed to my sobriety as well, it's just hard to articulate anything further to people reading this that are trying to stop because looking back, all of it feels like a lifetime ago. I wouldn't even recognize the person I was because of how far I've come. Maybe that idea of a drastic change in your personhood can help somehow.

Anytime I even think about alcohol now, which is rare, I think about how I could lose everything I've worked for so far. That thought doesn't scare me because I feel no need to relapse or ever drink again, it's just a reminder that I'm a completely different person now, even better than I was before I started drinking in the first place. I've learned so much about myself to the point that I'm almost grateful for the struggle I endured. That part may sound offensive to other alcoholics but feeling so low for so long has made me appreciate what I have through sobriety ten-fold. I've been able to repair most of my relationships with loved ones, I've gotten insanely good at my job and received a huge promotion this week as a result, I've lost 25 pounds while also conquering my eating disorder, and... I just feel so good. I literally start to smile sometimes when I think about how good I feel.

I definitely don't feel this way all the time but I know I would never feel it at all if I was still drinking. I also know being sober didn't fix my problems but it gave me the clarity and strength to work on them. Okay that one is probably from AA.

Thank you to everyone!",4,0
