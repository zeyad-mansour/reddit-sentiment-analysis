My bf (28) has been drinking for about 8-9 years now but more-so in the last couple. He drinks about 5 nights a week and can finish about 10-14 units of alcohol (1.5oz shots of whiskey) each night. I finally feel like he’s ready, and he has admitted his problem and plans to cut back and then quit. He never passes out. Never gets loaded-acting. High functioning, if you will. 

I am aware of the dangers of withdrawal and it scares us both. We have decided he could switch to beer at first, to help cut down a bit on his intake. Does this sound safe?  I’ve noticed he gets the little hand shakes sometimes, but unsure if it’s related because that’s been happening already for years. He also smokes as well if that’s a factor. Do you think he should consult a doctor to help quit? It’s difficult for us to find one and I’m worried it will just drag out the process.

I obviously want him to quit but I also want him to be safe while doing it.",1,0

Then the weekends grew to 4 days, then 5, then me rationalizing I didn’t have a problem because, “ I took last Thursday off.” Mainly I would drink an entire bottle of wine a night, and for a while, I felt fine. Then I found myself lying to my PCP because I thought it was none of her business and the accepted number of drinks per night was too stringent. Then I started to compare myself to my friends, when they had 1-2,  I continued drinking until I could hardly function in the mornings or sleep in until noon. I’m day 3 without a drink, and I want so badly to make this life change. Besides feeling “hungover” sick on Monday my heart has been racing for 3 days, and blood rushes to my head in waves.

Alcoholism runs in my family and ever since I started uni my binge drinking has gotten out of control. I black out every weekend and it leaves me extremely depressed afterwards, to the point I don’t leave bed for days. My dad is an alcoholic and I’ve seen the effects it’s had on us all so I want to quit while I’m ahead now before it’s too late. 

The problem is that at my age socialising and clubbing is synonymous with binge drinking, especially in my country (Scotland). I love to go out at night and have fun and I can’t do it sober - I can’t dance, talk to strangers, or have fun without drinking. But I really don’t want to do it anymore. 

I asked my friends for advice but they said that it was weird I couldn’t have fun with them sober or they just suggested drugs. I am into MDMA but I’m really careful about usage so regular consumption is a no (and I don’t like coke).

Has anyone ever tried to replace alcohol with weed, specifically for usage in social settings? Did it work for you? Why/why not? I think it will rely on which strain - does anyone have any recommendations?

I am writing to ask for advice. 
I recently started dating a man who admitted to me early on that he is a recovering alcoholic. At first, I was shocked, but he was very sweet and I decided to continue giving it a chance. 
We have now been dating officially for about 3 months (seeing each other for 4)  and I find myself falling for him. He has not relapsed and is staying sober and will be 9 months sober soon. 
The reason I write is because I read very recently that recovering alcoholics should not date for at least 1 year when beginning sobriety. I certainly don't encourage drinking and I barely drink myself, but I worry that I am setting myself up for heartbreak. I've already told him that if he starts drinking again, I'm done. 
Honestly, I just need advice. Alcoholism is a disease I still feel I know very little about.

40 days I posted in here (different account) that I was done.

And I've stayed with it.

I had about a week of physical symptoms, but nothing I felt required treatment.  It ran the gamut but stopped short of the Full Blown Stuff.  Since then, yes I have daily cravings, but I'm shocked how easy it's becoming.  For the first time in 22 years and my entire adult life, I just don't want it, anymore.  I love alcohol, but I don't want it to kill me.

Sobriety is a totally new experience for me.  I find I'm enjoying exploring the sensation.  For years I felt as if I was careening from moment to moment, and for a little over a month now, I haven't felt that I'm careening anymore.  Suddenly I'm present in a way with my kids and my wife that I've literally never been.  I was already losing weight but now it's just melting away.  My wife seems to think I am a completely different person, not just in the sense that I'm becoming the person again that I used to be (though that is true) but also in the sense that I have not had an identity without alcohol as a part of it at any time in my life.  We are beginning to have a sex life again, and it has been *awhile.*  I'm feeling feelings again, and finding I can manage them much more readily now- the volatility is fading.  The chronic arthritis pain has gone from a 9 to a 1, and I've found that the very stuff I was using to cover it was making it far worse between body weight and simple alcohol inflammation.  I can take acetaminophen and ibuprofen for the arthritis, which I couldn't before because I was trying to minimize liver damage and not compromise the drinking.  These crazy decisions I've made for years and years all seem so strange now as clarity increases.  

Anyway.

I'm shooting for 90 days now.

Thanks.",12,0

I will try to keep it short but I really need to get this out and hear some perspective.

My mom has always liked to drink, and openly talks about her addictive personality. She’s also smoked her entire life (quit for 2 years about 3 years ago, but picked it up again). However, tonight was something new to me entirely. I don’t live at home so I’m not really up to date with her changes, but I saw them all. 

We had a normal conversation about my stepdad’s upcoming 50th birthday party. She was planning something but keeping it secret, he mentioned how he’d love doing a party.

She completely lost it. Accusing him of already planning his own party, leaving her out of it, as he’d just admitted it. How he’s always taking her down, saying she’s crazy, how he’s forcing her to plan his party and then do this shit. She was crying and not making sense at all, just throwing accusations, about how we’re conspiring against her together. She was like an entirely different person.

There was no provocation at all. She has been talking about my stepdad being “aggressive”, but he’s practically my dad and he is the kindest man imaginable. This was a terrible outburst out of nowhere. She would not listen to common sense. 

I left the house and talked with my stepdad. He mentioned she’s on 2/3 bottles of wine a day, and how these outbursts happen a few times a week. He started crying and told me he was sorry I had to see it, but also glad because he had been slowly losing his mind over this behavior.

My mom is a psychologist, and straight up refuses to do any therapy, because she “knows every trick in the book”. I’m pretty sure if we’d mention rehab she’d also be very upset and might have an outburst again.

I really don’t know how to handle this. I love my mom, she’s an amazing person, but I didn’t recognize her. I’m terrified and I have no idea what to do or how I can help her. My stepdad is near the end of his rope, she’s destroying herself. What can I do?",1,0

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’m at the end of my tether and I’m really looking for some advice. This is a throwaway because my partner is active on reddit, and I’m sure he’d be displeased with this.

Me and my boyfriend (both early twenties) have been together for 4 years, no major problems and for the most part we are incredibly happy. We moved in together about a year or so ago, and this is when I started to notice that he drinks considerably more than I believe to be normal.

It began with him having a ‘shot’ in the morning to set himself up for the day. Now when I say shot, this is by no means a standard measure - I’m talking about a 1/4 of a 750ml bottle of whiskey.

He is noticeably different after a drink and I can smell it on him even after one drink. I’m not sure if this is enhanced because he sweats excessively, but it is what it is. I started smelling it on him more and more at really odd times of the day, and then the bottles started appearing.

I’d be cleaning our bedroom, and I’d find a bottle shoved behind our headboard. I’d go to put groceries away and find a bottle hidden behind cereal boxes. I’d find them stashed in the laundry basket, etc. Whenever I’d confront him, he’d claim that he ‘forgot’ he had them. I’d sometimes find upwards of 6 bottles of spirit when I’d only last checked a few days ago.

He has other mental health issues, and I’d asked him for his/our relationships sake that he be honest with me when I ask him if he’s had a drink. He sometimes will, and other times he will swear until he’s blue in the face that he’s not had a drink - even when I know he has.

He has lost relatives to alcoholism and actively admits that addictive tendencies seem to run in his family, and yet he denies absolutely that he is an alcoholic.

I am so so tired of finding empty bottles and receipts and having him lie to me, even after I’ve found him vomiting in the toilet minutes after I confronted him about suspected drinking. He tells me he’ll go to the doctors, but never does. He says he wants to change and accept help, but he never does.

I love him so much, but I cannot keep listening to him justify upwards of 10 750ml of alcohol a week as ‘relaxing’. He also drinks my alcohol - for instance if I bought a bottle of wine and only drank a glass, he’ll polish off the rest of the bottle after I’m asleep. I tell him about the damage he’s doing to himself, and that I won’t even consider marrying him until I can see that he’s taking this seriously, but nothing is ever enough to convince him he needs to take action.

I would like to stress that I am always trying to be as supportive as I can possibly me, and I try so hard not to be accusatory and I emphasise that it is his health and well-being that I am concerned about above all else. I understand that he has to want to quit for himself, and I am never asking him to do it for me (although sometimes in the heat of the moment I really want to)

The reason for my post is that I’m looking to find out what finally got it through to you? What resources are available? How can I best help him? Are there any best techniques to dealing with someone so in denial? Does he even sound like an alcoholic, or am I overreacting?

Thank you!",1,0

When I call her to see how she is its obvious that she is drunk and will flat out deny it and try and make me feel bad for not trusting her.

When she does snap out of the binge she is very sorry for her actions but I am trying to understand her mentality when she is mid binge

I've never posted anything before, but i feel like I could use some guidance on my circumstances. 
I just turned 21 a couple of months ago, and drink about 4-6 beers just about every night since I have been able to buy it myself. I know that some of my family has struggled with various addictions, and I myself had a destructive, in a loose sense of the word, relationship with pot. I get frustrated when I cant drink, and at the end of every day it is what i look forward to, as if it were my reason for making it through.

I wanted to share something with you all.,"Before sobering up, I was a sad drunk for over ten years. At the time I was traveling abroad a lot.

I was on a three-week binge drinking streak. I woke up and had a beer. This was the end of an era for me. I couldn’t think straight. My head was throbbing. I just wanted to have one more drink. I closed my laptop and went outside. A tear ran down my face for the first time during my travels. It’s really difficult to explain how I felt exactly.

I was dizzy and my hands were shaking again. I admitted in front of myself that I have a major alcohol problem, and I can’t carry on like this for much longer. Having the opportunities that most people can only dream off, I reduced my life to a series of blackouts.

It’s a vicious circle. When you’re living on the road among other vagabonds, nobody treats you seriously when you say you have a problem with alcohol, and you need help. Everybody thinks you’re just a drama queen. Until you can party and you’re not particularly violent, everything is just fucking dandy.

Sure, you can always say no, but what are you going to do then? Hang out with these drunk bastards sober?

I started thinking about death again. I wrote up a page in my journal. I’m copying it here without any corrections.

>I’m dying. With every particle of my body and every particle of my soul.

>I was bumming around the world just like that. Maybe because I’m an exile. Not an American, not an Englishman, not a Pole. I cannot feel the ground under my feet, the land—as they say—my own, my family, my motherland.

>When I’m writing, it gets better. So I write. I can write for several hours.

>Who has planted this seed of constant doubt and anxiety inside of me?

>I would be lying if I said that I don’t often think about suicide as a means to free myself from my mind. But it’s not clear what I should do. There is not a single obvious thing in my head. I am looking for a place in this world that I care for, and I can’t find it, although I would love to.

>I’ve traveled half of the globe. I’ve been to so many places. Me-the-nobody felt good everywhere. Me-whatever-his-name-is felt decent here and there. I, the-shadow-of-me, didn’t feel right anywhere. I can’t find my place.

>How hard it is to take this first step. I’ve been getting up for a long time now and telling myself: “I’m going to be perfect from now on!” But I never changed anything.

>I’m dying.

>All these people who wished me the worst all my life can relax now. I won’t be coming one day to take their women away anymore. I’m done. Fuck me.

>— Heard about this bald fucker that drank himself to death? He traveled so much. Didn’t work a day in his life. And then just died in some piss-stained alley in Saigon. Wonder how he fucking looked like then.

>And this will be the end of all my popularity and recognition that I craved so much. A few people will come to my funeral and forget about me while doing the dishes next week.

The next morning I decided to change something. I knew this line of thinking would push me into real depression and eventually kill me. I needed a long, sincere talk with myself to decide what I’m doing next. I really wanted to get better.

I wasn’t mature enough to address the root of my problems, but I could at least fight with the symptoms. I’ve decided to spend some time outside of my usual crowd and take up on new hobbies. Little did I know that actually getting better would take years. But somehow I managed to do it and SO CAN YOU.

He will drink all day every day but states ""I'm not an alcoholic because I only drink light beer"" I have tried to talk to him about getting help in the past but never had any success because he refused to admit that he needs help. It has slowly been pushing me away from him for years. I can't stand to see him kill himself because of his addiction. Recently I was able to finally move out of his house thanks to a shit job that paid enough money for me to live with two roommates. I thought that by no longer being financially dependent on him I could begin to help him because I wouldn't have to worry about him getting mad and no longer paying my bills. However, he recently had a stroke and he seems to be recovering from that pretty well his neurologist even cleared him to live alone but she did not clear him to drive. I learned today that even though he knows he shouldn't be driving or drinking (he had the stroke because of extremely high blood pressure and he has seen proof for years that alcohol raises his blood pressure) but that hasn't stopped him from doing both. I know it's not his fault because addiction is a bitch but now I feel completely helpless and depressed because when he had his stroke I quit my job to help him under the correct assumption that he would pay my bills until he got better and I could get another job again. But I cannot sit by and watch him kill himself and do whatever insane damage he is currently doing to himself sice his brain is still healing from his stroke but I feel like I don't have a choice because once again I am finacially dependent on him and this time technically my roommates are too and so I'm afraid that if I mention any of this to him I will make him mad and he will stop paying my bills. I'm trying desperately to find a job that will cover my bills but I'm not sure how much luck I'll have or how the hell I'm going to even survive watching him kill himself again.

As the title suggests, I've had a relapse which happened 11 days ago. Before this, I had been sober for over 3 months and crossed my 100 days milestone. I would like to hear your thoughts on how you have tackled a relapse before. How you have dealt with the aftermath and the shame, etc. Any thoughts are welcome.

**Short background info**

My sobriety until then had been strangely smooth. I think I quit drinking just at right time in my life, rising from the absolute rock bottom. My problem has always been hardcore binge drinking, but around 1/1,5 year before I quit, it floated into everyday drinking (drinking because of depression or being depressive because of the drinking? IDK). I'm 25 y/o now, started drinking when I was around 14 years old.

**The relapse**

Me and my girlfriend were invited to a wedding in Southern France on a castle. We saw this as an opportunity to get a prolonged weekend vacation. My cravings already started at the airport going to France. More intense cravings than I had experienced the past 3 months. The cravings came and left with different intensity the days in France prior to the wedding. Though it was nice to be on vacation, it was also very stressful because we had to move around from one city to another with new AirBNB hosts and so on.

On the wedding day, we ate breakfast 10 in the morning. Dinner was 21 in the evening, no lunch in between. I didn't know anyone at the wedding besides my girlfriend. But it was really nice and beautiful at a castle yada yada.

Bottom line is, that I couldn't hold it anyway and ended up blackout drunk. The relapse proceeded with ""reparation"" beers the following 2 days. So a 3 days relapse. I knew that it was wrong of me while during it. I felt absolutely terrible afterwards.

**What know?**

I managed to stop the bender after these 3 days and get back on track. Havn't drank anything since. If I didn't had the relapse, I would have been sober for 111 days today. I have decided not to reset my timer app, as it still works as a motivation. I have talked with my counselor on why it happened and how I can use it to locate the things that triggered it so I can prepare for another situation like that. I'm somehow a bit happy that it happened to a wedding in another country and not on a weekday.. What really grinds my gear now is that I can't truly say I've been sober for 111 days. But as my counselor said, if I had a large calendar with a star on each day I didn't drink, I could barely see my relapse on it. 

Have you guys similar experiences with relapses? How did you tackle it? I have been trying not to dwell too much with it and to move forward, but still use it constructively.",1,0

I would drink every other month or so and never overkill. My wife made the point that my frame of reference is skew. I imagine this is true, I was in a frat and ended in the party group, partying 3-5 times a week.

I am an immigrant from another country (arrived in CA when I was 14) where mental health/addiction is not really acknowledged as a health issue, and do not know much about how treatment works.  I did not grow up with health insurance (I have it now) and am wary of doctors. I would even say I have a slight phobia of being hospitalized or committed to a psych ward.  If I go to the Doctor and tell them I'm alcoholic, can anything bad happen to me?  Is this something that can have negative consequences I'm not considering?  I am worried about having a diagnosis like this on my medical record following me around, for things like employment, schooling etc..  I also heard a story where a guy who got help with his addiction, but years later when he injured himself, the doctors denied him pain medicine, and he had to recover in excruciating pain.  The idea of being injured in a hospital, lying in pain absolutely terrifies me.  I work outside with my hands for a living, and the possibility of getting injured and needing pain medicine definitely exists.  


I really want to get better.  I have not drank in two days (and as a result haven't slept in two days) but I don't know where to turn.  Family doesn't really acknowledge the problem (in our home country everyone gets drunk).  Friends are helpful and supportive when I need a pat on the back, but at the end of the day can't help to the extent I need.

Somewhere inside me knew I had a problem. I was getting black out drunk too much and the weekends were always a mess. But I ignored my heart and as always learned the hard way.

Two weeks ago now I got blind drunk again and thought that my need for a bit of Kentucky fry was greater than the risk of driving drunk and killing someone or myself.

Well, thankfully no one was hurt but me. The cops got me and took me back to the station where I blew 1.17, the night was young were it any later I would have been slapped with a DUI for sure.

I told my husband how hard last night was especially when he offered me a glass of wine (which he admits was dumb because just last week he lectured me about not drinking anymore and if someone were to offer me a drink to turn it down). He apologized to me and said he would not do that again. I also told my husband that I joined these subreddits and some facebook groups for support. I said that it's been suggested that I treat myself to something nice for getting through my first 24 hours without a drink, and for turning down booze last night. We settled that we'd get iced coffee when he was done work and for supper we got subway. (May not seem like a treat to some but it's all I wanted lol).

I'm gonna try keep this short but basically I'm a little concerned with my use of alcohol - so if tldr go off that.

I'm 26 and at uni, a bit over halfway way through a bachelor's. I started a bit over a year ago (accelerated program.) The drinking culture here at the uni is the worst I've ever seen, much worse than back in Australia. Drinking 250-500ml Vodka on top of beer is a normal night for many.

Lately I've had problems of blacking out when i drink, and I often end up doing things I regret. We have a great community so it hasn't caused huge problems, but I don't wanna do something really dumb when I'm out of my mind. The thing is that I still seem quite sober even when I'm blackout drunk, so I don't get refused service and my friends don't recognize that I'm very drunk.

There is a history of alcoholism in my family, which has always worried me, I vowed to never be hooked on anything (don't even drink coffee.)

 I drank a lot on weekends when I was 18-19. Then I sobered up for several years until I got to this university. I'm seen as a party animal, and everybody else is like 19-20, I drink to enjoy the party, because otherwise I just find it boring - seen it all before.

I keep telling myself that I'll take it easier next time, but then surprise surprise, next event, I blackout again. 

Is this a problem? What can I do to force myself to moderate my intake without simply staying home?

She has an important job, makes good money, and no one would ever know it outside of my family. 

She got in a bad car accident because she was drinking and driving about 9 years ago now. She crashed into a parked car on her way home from a bar on her birthday and ended up with a brain hemorrhage and her front teeth going through her top lip. She is one of those drunks that really does not think she is drunk and will deny it up and down which is dangerous because she thinks she can drive. I was volunteering at a horse barn a couple of years ago and she started taking lessons there and showed up for her lessons drunk one day and I ended up getting into a fist fight with her in front of everyone at the barn in order to take her car keys away from her. There have also been family holiday dinners throughout the years where she has showed up completely wasted. I used to dread going over to her house because I was worried about how she would be when I walked through her door. 

Last year we found out that she had somehow gotten a hold of pain killers and was mixing those with alcohol (we were wondering why after 1 drink she was already really drunk). She will sometimes hide alcohol and chug it before her husband gets home because he gets mad when he sees her drinking. He would like her to stop completely and thinks she needs to go to rehab or something similar. Again she has an important job and is a big fish in a small pond. She thinks that is extreme and would never step away from her job to do that (especially because everyone would know why she left) My stepdad is judgmental so she will not call him to come pick her up when she has drunk too much because she is afraid he will get mad so she drives herself home (or she thinks she is fine to drive herself home and she is not). I don’t think he is as supportive as he should be and punishes her by giving her the silent treatment. 

My mom is normally a very classy, intelligent, kind and beautiful person. She doesn’t see that her drinking is a problem because she doesn’t do it every day and is able to maintain her normal life in regards to work and friendships. She is also kind of a perfectionist and hates for people to see her in any other way than in control. So is very defensive when I try to bring it up with her because feels like I am being condescending no matter how gently I approach it. 

She does not want to completely stop drinking because that would:
1. Be admitting that the has a problem with alcohol
2. It would be admitting to everyone else in the world that she has a problem with alcohol (social events etc.)

She probably binge drinks on her own a couple times a month. Especially when her husband is out of town. The day after we got in the fist fight (which is very out of character for both of us) she cried and apologized about it and said she would go to therapy which she did but that did not last very long. We have talked about it a few times since then after she gets really drunk but she always brushes it off. I seriously don’t know what to do or how to help her. I am really scared for her safety and her mental health because I don’t think that she is happy. She usually does not take it seriously when I express this to her.

 Does any one have any advice for helping a functional alcoholic? It would almost be easier to help her if she was a stereotypical alcoholic because for now she does not think she has an alcohol problem since she doesn’t do things like drink every day.

Thank you for listening.  I am trying to study but my stepdad just texted me that they had to leave her work dinner early because she drank too much and he said “ I don’t know how much mor of this I can take”. 
There’s no one else in my family that I can really talk to about it (normally I would ask my mom for advice).",1,0

For the last couple of months, I have been drinking up to a 750ml bottle of vodka a day. All in secret. My husband has found my liquor a few times but it hasn't stopped me from doing it again.   


I wake up, and the first thing I do is take a shot of vodka. Even before work, I would get at least a buzz on. I've even been drinking at work. It's really starting to affect my life. I've almost lost my job because I got so drunk the night before work that I couldn't finish my shift the next day.   


I woke up at 2 this morning and the first thing I thought to myself was, ""I wish we had a 24-hour liquor store"".   


But, last night, after getting fairly drunk throughout the morning/afternoon, I drove around my town for almost an hour trying to avoid the liquor store. I just did loser laps until I had to pick up my husband. Then afterward, I went to the grocery store and I was going to get a bottle, but I just decided to drive right past the liquor store.   


I can't guarantee that I don't by a bottle on my way to work, but I am sure as hell going to try my best. I can't do this anymore. It's literally going to kill me. My liver is failing. I also have schizophrenia and it's just making my mind worse. Any encouragement from you guys would be helpful I think.

He's my best friend and I love him dearly. I can imagine a happy future together, but one persisting thought keeps clouding everything in my head. He's always enjoyed a beer or two. However, there have been a few times in the past where it became obvious that it was more than that and a problem. For example, there were a couple of times I'd go to his house in the evening and he'd worked his way through a six-pack because of a bad day. He'd also had incidents where he'd gotten extremely drunk at parties and couldn't remember how he'd gotten home. I know there were other times he'd been drinking in excess on his own, but only found out about these much later. I knew deep down that his drinking was an issue, but the incidents were spaced out over quite a long period of time and so I naively chose to ignore them, mostly because it was easier not to confront it in my own head. 

About a year ago, he got very drunk on his own in the evening and fell over and hit his head. He told me about it the next day and admitted he had a problem. He was sober for around 5 months and attended AA meetings. A few months ago, he started drinking again, but assures me that it's in moderation. It's been months, but seeing him drink still fills me with anxiety. I haven't seen him get drunk or drink excessively, so it's hard to sort out in my own head if these worries are well-placed. I have expressed my concerns about the problem resurfacing, but he assures me the drinking is now controlled. We have been on a couple of holidays since, where he has drank every evening. It's only been around 2 pints of beer with dinner, maximum 3/4 in a day, but it still bothers me that it has to be every evening. We don't live together, but to my knowledge and from what I've seen, he isn't drinking this much during the week at home and has several alcohol-free days a week. He goes to work drinks and birthday parties etc, and I'm really not sure how much he's drinking at these events. I'm quite a light drinker, so I'm not sure if this is clouding my judgement, but I hate it when he suggests getting a beer. 

Am I overreacting, or is this a genuine concern?

Let's call my stepfather's son Dave. Dave and I are best friends, were college roommates, and we even bought houses on the same street later in life. We were best drinking buddies for over 20 years, and we drank a lot, even by alcoholic standards. Every day, to excess. But we were both highly functional drunks.

Dave and I became 6 figure earners in our 30s, had cool houses, cool cars, and hot wives. From the outside, Dave and I were living the dream. Then my life started to crumble due to my alcoholism, around 2004, 2005. I got a DUI, continued to drink for a year past that, and I got sober on 8/30/2006. Dave kept drinking. I saved my marriage, Dave lost his. We're as close to being twins as two people can be that don't share DNA.

Dave has had multiple DUIs. I've picked him up for work release over the years, seen him hit his wife when he's drunk, seen him abandon his car after accidents while drunk, you name it. Yesterday was Dave's sentencing for his 4th DUI. He was charged with a felony under his home state's repeat DUI offender law. 

Dave was sentenced to 270 days in jail. He's a clean-cut white male in his early 50s who probably makes $150k a year, so as our justice system would have it, he's eligible for work release. 200 days of every night in jail that's 45 minutes from his house, and the last 70 will be ankle bracelet. His recently purchased Ford Raptor has an interlock. I have no idea how he still has a license, but Dave can afford really good lawyers.

Dave has not told his 83 year old father any of this. His father will be crushed. In fact, I may be the only family member who even knows the extent of Dave's drinking, and all the legal trouble he's had in the last 20 or so years. As a stark contrast, today I woke up a free person, still married, sober and clear.

Few of us ever get to see how our lives would have turned out if we kept on drinking. I did. If you are questioning your drinking, please remember the story of cat\_tastic720 and Dave. Don't become Dave. Dave is in a tough spot today, and will be in that tough spot for a long time to come. Dave isn't someone who is going to do well sleeping in jail for the next 7 months. He may lose his career, that's to be determined. It's complicated.

I'm a 26 year old man, when I was around 22/23 years old U was a heavy drinker (I've relapsed off and on since then). Well my mom would help me cut back on drinking by giving me tiny 8 to is fans of beer a day. She did this for about a week. The thing is, she would go into a different room, up n the beer, and come into my room to give it to me. I assumed maybe she opened it in the other room to take a sip for herself, or something. 

Well these beers didn't end up doing anything for me, so I relapsed pretty heavily. 

A few days later, for several days, I would drink alcohol, and eat some of my mom's food ( that she prepared separate from other people's food) and get extremely sick. These nights were the strangest/scariest nights of my life. I threw up violently, heard voices saying I was going to hell and that I was going to die, and hallucinating voices of babies crying. On one night I literally felt like my soul left my body, and was looking at me from outside of my window, saying my name or something. Around this time, I found antabuse (disulfiram) in my mom's medicine cabinet. I did some research and the effects U had were definitely from that. I know my mom wasn't giving it to herself because she regularly drank and never got sick. And I have a VERY high tolerance for alcohol, but got deathly sick from tiny amounts. Antabuse is a prescription drug, but I think my mom got it from Mexico, because it was not in a prescription container and there was Spanish writing on it. Well ever since then I rarely eat food prepared by my mom. I've only told a couple people this because I know people would automatically assume I'm delusional, since believing you are being poisoned is a common delusion. The people I've told have mostly been on my mom's side or seen kind of skeptical. I told my therapist about this, about 2 1/2 years ago, and she told me ""Have you ever thought she might be desperate to get you to stop drinking?"" And I told her that you could be charged with attempted murder, because people drinking while on antacids basically give you an immediate hangover, but if you're an extreme alcoholic, as I was, you would just keep and keep on drinking, wondering why you're not getting a buzz, while still suffering the life threatening effects of heavy alcohol use.

My name is James and I am 40.

In my late 20s, when I first started making enough money to bring home bottles of liquor to ""build a liquor cabinet"", I started noticing that I wouldn't make it through an evening movie without having five, six drinks.

I remember my first real hangover.  I was 28.  My friend Thomas and I went to a restaurant.  I had been drinking the night before and I told myself I wouldn't drink that night.  He persuaded me to split a bottle of wine.  We did and we merrily went back to my house.  He had a couple of friends come over.  We started drunkenly playing the piano, it was fun.  One of his friends was kind of.. not-worldly.  She asked if I wanted another drink and I said yes.  She filled a rocks glass to the brim with tequila and handed it to me.  I drank it in five minutes, I couldn't taste that it was straight alcohol.  I stood up and fell over.  I stood up and fell over.  I fell into the bathroom.  I fell into the tub.  I fell out of the bathroom.  I told the roomful of people I had to go to bed.  I do not remember the next day, except that I was crying for most of it.

I stopped having booze in the house.  My drinking was daily, but under control.

At 37, I started dating a wonderful man.  He was younger than me, taller than me, smarter than me, and he adored me.  He wanted us to move in together, get a dog together.  I told him that I wanted to wait.

A few days before our first year anniversary, he told me I was the love of his life.  He told me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.  I called my mom the next day.  I told her he was the one.  I told her I wanted to buy us a dog.  My mom and I bought a beautiful dog, her name is Charlie.  My boyfriend was overjoyed.

At 39, we found a perfect house to live in.  In the city, but in a quiet part, on the outskirts of downtown.  There was a backyard and a basement.  We had a housewarming and I felt truly happy.

I do freelance work, and I lost my biggest client a few days after we moved in.  I became depressed.  I spent a week in bed.  I had joined a different kind of gym, one close to the new place, that has classes.  I bought a membership.  I found myself unable to go.  I was too depressed.

My boyfriend wanted to have a liquor cabinet.  I spent the first two months feeling terrible.  I thought it was about the loss of my client.  No: I was drinking.  A lot.  And I didn't even really realize it.  I was emptying the bottles, one by one, and replacing them every week.

I started to put on a little weight and lose muscle.  I have always been skinny and fit, but I started to get a paunch.  My depression got worse.  I started sending angry messages to people who I was mad at, usually late at night, or first thing in the morning.  I'd post impulsive things on social media.

A friend, who I'd sent an angry message to, wrote on social media that I was an abusive person.  Posted it on Facebook.  Screenshotted my message to her.  I spiralled out.  It was 6am, and I sent a suicide note and picked up a knife from the drawer.  I sharpened it and started walking down to the lake.  I was going to slit my wrists and get in the water to bleed out.  As I was walking down, the friend e-mailed me and begged me to live and apologized.  I started crying.  I walked around the city by myself.  When I came home, I lay in bed with my still-sleeping boyfriend.  I told him I loved him.  The police had been called by one of the recipients of my suicide note.  They took me to the hospital and confined me.  They released me a couple days later.

I started seeing a therapist, who was helping me deal with my issues.  I put a lot of stock in the opinions of others, and can feel crushed when somebody doesn't like me, or seems to respect me.  I downplayed my drinking to my therapist.

My boyfriend had always been sexually compulsive in our relationship.  He had assured me that he loved our sex life, but that he liked sleeping around.  We had rules, but he tended to break them, or just behave in insensitive ways.  His compulsive behaviour increased.  I would see him surfing Grindr every morning as I made breakfast.  He slept with a man once when he was annoyed that I'd gone to see a movie with a friend he didn't like.  He was constantly sexting people, his ex-lover, including two of my own friends.

I snooped on his phone and was angry about the extent of his sexual activity, the sexting.  I saw that he was speaking poorly about my sexual performance to a group chat with his friends in it.  I saw that he was speaking about how much he missed his ex-lover to his friends.

After I told him I'd snooped and I was hurt, he told his friends I'd snooped.  They told him that trust was no longer present in our relationship.  They started telling him to leave me.

His compulsion increased, as did my drinking.  When he worked late, I would have five to eight 2.5oz drinks before he got home.  I would smoke a little weed before he got back and pretend I was really high.  When he wasn't working late, and was home, I hid a bottle of tequila on the back porch.  I would step out for a cigarette and take swigs from the bottle without him knowing.

One night, I made dinner and had a plate made for him.  I thought he'd be getting home around 8, but he didn't get home until midnight; he decided to hook up with somebody on his way home.  Around 11, I was wasted.  I was trying to put his plate of food in a warm oven, in and out, so the fish didn't dry out.  I spilled quinoa all over the oven.  I was too drunk and the oven was too hot.  I turned the oven on ""self clean"".  I passed out in bed.  My boyfriend came home and I was passed out and there was smoke pouring out of the kitchen.

I kept telling myself I needed to stop.  My drinking became like a ritual.  ""My last drink,"" I would tell myself, and toast to myself.  I would have a second, and a third, each one feeling like my last.  I would have my sixth, and say to myself, ""I'm so happy that as of tomorrow, I'm a non-drinker.""  This would happen every night.

I was losing days of work to my hangovers.  My boyfriend and I were fighting more.  I was in worse shape than I'd ever been.  We went to the beach, and he took a photo of me.  My gut was visible, and unattractive, and he commented, ""maybe not the best angle.""  I woke up the next morning, hungover, crying, and said, ""I feel fat.""  He was unsympathetic.

Our sex life became strange.  He'd initiated our morning activity by putting my hand on him.  I am the more active lover, but he started being unappreciative.  The last time I performed oral sex on him, I asked him how it was, and he just said, ""I'm late for work,"" and got up and got dressed.

I went out again with my friend that he doesn't like.  We were drinking at the bar.  I came home and my boyfriend picked a fight with me.  He started yelling at me about how he respects me less for hanging out with this particular friend.  He called my friend a shithead.  He went on his group chat and posted a long story about how shitty my friend was, and how he respected me less for hanging out with him.

I told him that his behaviour tracked as abusive... you're not supposed to isolate your partner from his friends.  He went on his group chat and told them that I accused him of being an abuser.  I had done no such thing, I just asked him to stop picking on my friend.  He yelled at me, ""I will never stop shit-talking him!""

We resolved the fight a few days later.  He apologized for what he did.  He said he had his own requests.  He told me I needed to secure a new client.  He told me I could no longer be depressed, I had to get out of it.  He said, finally, ""you really need to up your sex game!""  I called my mom the next morning and said I thought we were going to break up.

His birthday was a few days later.  I was anxious about being around his social circle.  They all had been hearing that I was a terrible person in group chat.  They were warm but distant.  I started hearing snippets of conversation and thinking they were talking about me.  They told me about a plan to sing karaoke the next weekend.  They implied that I was invited; I am great at karaoke and they always invite me, even when my boyfriend isn't available.  I didn't drink at dinner, but when I got home, I snuck a few drinks in before bed.

That weekend, I wasn't invited to karaoke.  I was depressed, and I stayed home by myself and drank.  I didn't reach out and ask if I could come.  I made up my mind to break up with my boyfriend.  It was clear he wasn't happy.  His sexual compulsion suggested that something was up.  His dismissiveness toward my sexual performance suggested he'd lost his attraction toward me.

He came home and I told him I didn't like the way he talked about me in group chat.  I told him I didn't like the way he talked about my friends.  I told him he could be casually cruel to me.  I told him I wanted to break up.  He said he had wanted to break up for a while.  We went to bed and it was OK.

The next day, while he was at work, I snooped on his computer again.  He had already joined Tinder and changed his Grindr status to ""newly single"".  He was making plans to visit his ex-lover.  He had made a plan to fly to Chicago so sleep with a man he had a crush on over Instagram.  I became depressed and I started drinking, a lot.

He moved out a few days later.  Without him in the house, I was drinking constantly.  One night, feeling belittled and sad, I got blackout drunk.  I was smoking on the patio, passed out, and I suddenly regained consciousness.  I had fallen over the railing.  My head was on the stone below, my leg caught in the railing.  I went inside.  I didn't realize, but I'd given myself whiplash and a concussion.  I went on Twitter and started posting.  I posted that my dick was fine, and I couldn't believe my boyfriend didn't think so.  I posted that he was a size queen.  I posted that his friends didn't know how terrible he'd been to me.  I posted a photo of my dick and said, ""look this is what he says is not good enough.""

My boyfriend came over in a rush.  He saw that my head was bleeding and put rubbing alcohol on it.  He stayed the night.  I cried in bed the next morning.  I told him I didn't want him to leave.

He texted me that night that he missed me.  He told me he loved me.  He told me he was sorry he drove me away with his sexual activity and belittlement.  I spoke to him the next day; he said he hadn't meant what he had texted.  That I was exhausting and he wanted a break.  He did want to break up.  I was devastated.

Every night I still was getting blackout drunk.  Last night, I started looking around the house for some means to kill myself.  I was going to hang myself with the dog leash.  I was going to cut my wrists in the tub.  At 1am, I called my boyfriend, instead.

I told him that I was an alcoholic and I needed treatment.  I told him that he needed therapy for his sex addiction.  I told him our relationship was too good, too loving, to give up so easily.  I told him that I loved him.  I told him that he had told me, once, that I was one of the best lovers he'd ever had.  I told him that a good sexual relationship requires work from both partners.  I reminded him that he'd told me I was the love of his life, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.  I barely remember the conversation, I was so drunk.

This morning, I was crying and hungover.  I called my mom and told her I was an alcoholic.  I called my boss and told him the same and that I needed help; he agreed to be part of my support group.  I called my friend Jeff who is in AA, and had previously told me it had changed his life and that he was going to help me whenever I felt I needed it.  Jeff agreed to take me to a meeting this Sunday.  He told me I could call him any time.

I told my boyfriend that I didn't want him to be a part of my support group.  I told him I wanted space for now, but I wanted to see him in a week so I could tell him that I'd been sober for a week.  He told me he'd booked an appointment for a couples therapist, and found his own therapist also.

I am lying in bed and I am feeling so sad.  I have alienated my friends.  I have alienated my boyfriend.  I have allowed alcohol to put my body into its worst state.  My head hurts from the concussion.  My leg hurts from the fall.  I am drinking herbal tea in bed and watching Peaky Blinders.

I know I may not get my boyfriend back.  I may not get my friends back.  I may still be depressed in a week, a month.  But I will never have another drink.  I have a friend who loves me.  I have a wonderful dog named Charlie.  I will get through this.",110,0

But, i can stop at a few drinks. 

I have cravings the days after drinking. But i dont readily give in. 

I love the feeling of being drunk, and drinking and being drunk has interrupted my school. But it doesnt always.

As in, ive missed a few days of classes to hangovers. ive gone to a lot of classes drunk.

but in the grand scheme, it hasnt effected my preformance.

I can go 5 days, then i will go on a 3 day bender. Ill spend a few days in withdrawal, then not drink for 2 weeks.

Then ill have a six pack, not get drunk, and stop. a few days later go on another bender. Have withdrawal.

What im saying is, its extremely inconsistent. 

Often, ill black out and drink way more than i intended to. It seems to happen at random.

And i have quite the tolerance, i can down nearly a liter of vodka in an evening (over like 2 hours or so). i will be extremely drunk, but i can still appear sober if i need to (after a few hours, like 3 or so, hours of recovery).

I just dont know at this point. I seem to lack the compulsion some times, and have it others. 

I can drink in moderation sometimes, other times i want to get DRUNK.",3,0

The thing is while there are positive effects that encourage me to continue abstinence I still find myself struggling with my depression and underlying mental illnesses. A lot of times with this it, I do feel that ""want"" to go into alcohol or substance to ""replace"" that pain inside me with some other feeling from it.

I’ve never shared before, so I’m gonna tell my story here in hopes that it gets me more comfortable with sharing. It’s ridiculously long though, so I attempted a TLDR at the the end. Just thought I’d go into as much detail as possible as to not leave anything out.","Growing up I never felt like I fit in. My mind was always telling me I was different, I wasn’t like everyone else. I wasn’t good enough to hang out with certain people, or my opinion wasn’t important enough to be heard. In my own mind I was nobody special. So feeling like an outcast already on the inside, turned into me being super quiet & shy around everyone & actually making myself an outcast. I didn’t hang out with anyone because I never tried to talk with anyone. I didn’t think they’d want to hang out anyways, so why bother. 

But then after my freshman year of HS I ended up going to summer school & ended up riding the bus with someone from my neighborhood that I used to play football with. He remembered who I was & would sit with me. He was always talking about going to hang out with people after school to smoke weed. I never thought I’d try it, but he was so outgoing. He had friends, a girlfriend. He looked happy all the time. He had the social life & confidence that I wanted. So I thought if I smoked weed that maybe it would help me be like him, & if not at least I’d have someone to hang out with. 

I tried it & weed was my go to substance since I was 14 up until I joined the Navy, because I was underage & it was just easier to get. It didn’t give me the effect I was searching for though. If I wasn’t paranoid, it would make activities/food more enjoyable & made it easier for me to hang out with people, but it didn’t change the way I felt on the inside. It didn’t make me more outgoing at all like I had hoped. I still had very low self esteem & no confidence. I was still extremely quiet, but people wanted to hang out with me so I kept doing it. It’s wasn’t the most enjoyable thing for me, but i was finally hanging out with people, so I was content. 

When I turned 17 I decided to take my first drink. I was offered a few times prior to that, but I thought weed was good enough. I didn’t care to try anything else. But then after my high school graduation, I was invited to a party. This was the first high school party I’d been invited too where people were drinking. Before that it was just kickbacks with people hanging out & smoking. Finally I was invited to a real party. & it looked like they were having a great time. Music was blasting, everyone looked happy, people were dancing, & laughing. I was excited to be there, but there was no way I was gonna fit in. I felt so uncomfortable and out of place. This whole environment was the exact opposite of my personality. I just said fuck it, everyone else here is drinking. I guess I could try it. It’ll at least help me fit in if anything. I hated the taste, but I was starting to feel the effects, so I kept drinking. 

I loved the feeling alcohol gave me right away. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. My shyness was gone, along with all the thoughts I had about people judging me. I didn’t care what people thought anymore. I had that false confidence that I never had when I was sober or high. I could do & say whatever I wanted without a second thought. I felt like I was on top of the world. I felt like I finally fit in. I no longer worried about anything when I was drunk. My thoughts didn’t hold me back anymore. I was free. I could dance. I could have fun with people. I could finally talk to girls. All of my fears went away when I started drinking & I finally got to be a part of the social life I thought I always wanted. Alcohol was so much fun & stress free at first. Alcohol made me feel comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life. I loved it. I wished I started drinking sooner. 

Looking back I drank alcoholically from the beginning. I blacked out that first night. I had no idea how I got home, but I remember waking up the next day in so much pain. I threw up several times, had a throbbing headache, my stomach ached. I remember thinking this sucks, I never feel this way after smoking weed. I’m never doing that again. But I wanted that feeling again from the night before. I wanted to party & have fun & not care about anything. I felt like when I drank the real me got to come out. I didn’t hate myself & I wasn’t shy anymore. Plus I’m going to college. It’s the perfect place to have nights like that 1st one again. So, maybe I’ll just drink less next time. I still wanted the good feelings, just no hangover. 

So I went off to college a few months later, but I still wasn’t 21 yet, so weed was still my go to. It was my first time living in a different city & on my own. I was terrified of being away from my friends, but the school had 3 things I wanted. It had a good nursing program & it was far away from my parents, so I could avoid them for a bit & smoke as much as I wanted. And the main reason I chose it was because apparently it was a big party school. I just wanted to go have fun. That’s what college is all about right. The degree was just a bonus. & plus I had money saved up from my job & graduation gifts, so I could buy weed when I got there and find people to hang with. I got a random roommate since nobody I knew was going there & that was awkward. We hardly ever talked or hung out, but we never had any problems. It was off to a rough start. 

Then that first weekend came and I found some crowds to follow to where the frat houses were. I dipped in & out of a few to see which ones had the prettiest girls and/or people I could see myself hanging out with. Some houses were weird, but I found one playing the music i liked, the setup was nice, & the people seemed great. I asked someone if I could smoke there, pulled out a blunt, & instantly made some connections. From then on that was where I spent every Thursday - Saturday night. & not once was I able to limit my drinks. I don’t think I even tried. But I wasn’t blacking out every night & I didn’t always get a hangover, so I didn’t really care to. At that point I just figured a hangover was a part of it & it was worth it for all the fun I was having. & I didn’t care about black outs as long as I made it home. That just made for interesting stories to me. & somehow I always made it back to my room every night, so clearly this isn’t a problem. It’s just what college kids do. 
I was having a blast & planning on joining the frat the next semester. I still didn’t really have friends & still no luck with the ladies, but surely joining the frat would solve my problems. 

But after going home for Christmas break, I felt all those true connections I wasn’t getting anymore. I thought college would be easy for me to make friends & find a girl, but I was still super uncomfortable with myself unless I was drinking. It was like a complete 180 with my personality. I’d go right back to being the quiet kid. I missed being around my family & best friends. I missed having people to genuinely talk with about things & it seemed like everyone was still having fun back home. I wanted to just stay there with the people I knew, but I knew I couldn’t. So when I got back in January I didn’t party for a while. I just smoked by myself for a couple weeks instead of going out. Then I ran into someone from the frat who asked me why I missed whatever it’s called where I try to join. I felt like I shouldn’t show up there at all anymore. I spoke big of joining last semester and just flaked. I couldn’t show my face there. I went to a couple other frats for a bit, but I didn’t care much for them. The party scene didn’t feel like it was getting me anywhere anyways. After a while I just didn’t show up to class anymore either. I was just getting high by myself in my room most days. One day a cop comes knocking on the door. The RA already warmed me before Christmas break, but I thought I’d be fine. I was so scared. I never had to deal with a cop before so I didn’t know what to expect. I knew it reeked in there so I just cooperated. He just took my stuff & they marked it as violating the no alcohol in the dorms rules. Which was just a fine I’d have to pay off, so I feel I got lucky there. I should’ve taken it as a sign to get my act together, but instead of turning things around I just said fuck it, I’m just gonna drop out. I want to go home. 

So now I’m back home, like I wanted, but it doesn’t feel right. I felt ashamed of myself for dropping out. Like I let everyone down. I still wasn’t 21 yet, but at this point my best friend was. So we’d drink here & there along with continuing to smoke weed all the time. I was working shitty jobs and realized how bad I messed up. I thought I should’ve stayed in college & maybe I’ll go back, but I was afraid I had no self control. I’d probably just end up partying all the time. Yeah I wanted an actual career, but the partying is what I really missed, so I can’t go back. I started drinking a little bit more & it didn’t feel anything like it used to. I was miserable. What happened to the thing I used to love so much. It stopped working the way it used to. So, one day I decided to stop & try to get my life together. I was gonna join the Navy. That’ll be a great idea. I could still do medical stuff & retire young after 20 years of service, or so I thought. So I quit drinking & smoking for a little while. I felt those were holding me back & I wanted to start working out to be ready for boot camp. After a few months of no substances I thought I’d be ok, so I started smoking again. I still had a year before I was going to boot camp, so why not. I quit before, so as long I quit a month before I join I’ll be fine. 

Things were well for a while. Almost everyone at my job smoked so we all got along. One guy started working there with some mushroom and acid connections and I thought that’d be fun, so I got heavy into those for a couple months. We had parties here and there & that was the only time I’d drink. It was always fun at parties, so I’d be ok. & then one day this girl gets hired that caught my eye. She likes to smoke and drink too, so I thought we’d get along perfect. We went to a couple parties together & started talking. We dated for like 2 months, before she decided to go back to her ex. This was the first girl I’d ever been with at the embarrassing age of 19. So my crazy ass felt like I was in love and was devastated that it didn’t work out. 

This was the first time in my life where I didn’t care what time of day it was, I just didn’t want to be sober anymore and deal with my thoughts. I was gonna smoke or drink any chance I could get. I just wanted to numb the pain. My last month leading up to boot camp I couldn’t smoke, so I drank just about every day. 

Fast forward to after boot camp. It was a few months before I turned 21, but I had a lovely new military ID. & being the shitbag I was, I decided to go out every weekend and drink. Some places didn’t care to check birth date when they saw we were military. I thought nothing of my drinking though. Yeah I threw up in a couple taxis headed back to base & got carried to my room a few times, but hey, that’s just a part of drinking. I was still passing my classes to become a Corpsman. So I was doing fine. Then the day care when I turned 21. 


The next 2 years at my first duty station, I was drunk almost every single day. I didn’t see it as a problem. I enjoyed coming home from work & drinking after a long day. & most people in the Navy are heavy drinkers, so I had no problem finding people to drink with if I wanted to. They probably drank more than the college people, which at the time I didn’t think was possible. It was great. It didn’t matter what day it was for some people. I could almost always find someone to drink with. & if not it’ll make my video games more fun. Drinking was just a normal part of the Navy. 

We switched between day & night shift every 3 months, so I began day drinking. Something I thought I’d never do, but hey it’s ok when you work all night. It’s the only time I’m really able to drink on work days. Plus I made it to work everyday & I was moving up in rank. So obviously my drinking wasn’t a problem. It was just something to do. Eventually I got into a more serious relationship. & once again my crazy ass fell in love. This one lasted about 8 months before it started to fall apart. Once again I was devastated, & my drinking picked up. Although previously I would only drink to end the day/night, now I was drinking any time I wasn’t at work. I isolated myself & just drank in my room all the time. This lasted for months. Most times it wasn’t even making me feel better, but I’d rather be drunk than sober I thought. It’s not like being sober was fun. Eventually I started to feel concerned about my health. I was working in the ER, so I could see some of the consequences heavy drinking could lead to. It was scary, but it didn’t matter, I couldn’t quit. I couldn’t even slow down. 

This is the first time I actually had trouble stopping. I’d wake up everyday and tell myself I wouldn’t drink that night & always end up drunk. I just couldn’t stand being sober. So after night shift one drunken morning I call up a friend and tell him I need help. We walk over to the drug & alcohol program advisor to see what they could do. I was in there balling, telling them how much I drink, how miserable I was, & I couldn’t stop. So they set me up with the rehab counselor to see what level of treatment they think I needed & they recommended the 35 day inpatient. I immediately changed my mind. I thought that would look terrible for my career & I was supposed to go to my next duty station soon, so I’d rather not have that hanging over me going into a new command. 

Since I was a self referral, there was nothing they could do. But then a few weeks later I decide to borrow another Corpsman’s car to get food in the middle of the night. He was working, & I was off, so he didn’t care. I didn’t mention I’d been drinking, but I’m a good driver so it didn’t matter. But I didn’t get food. I called another friend on the way to see if he wanted to grab something withe, but he was at a club & said I should come. I figured a few more drinks wouldn’t hurt & it could be fun. I woke up the next afternoon on the friends couch from the club. With missed calls from the guy who’s car I took, my mom, my ex, my entire chain of command. Nobody knew where I was, or if I was even alive. But all I thought was how I knew I fucked up. & to top it off I left his car by the club. So at least I didn’t drive it after blacking out, but that’s the only positive to this fucked up story. I took an Uber to go get that back to the base for him, but I was locked outside my room until I called my chief. He talked to me for a min, said he’d been to my room and saw the open handle of crown royal on my dresser. I should’ve, but I couldn’t get in trouble for completely fucking over my friend outside of work. He said after that happened & all I’ve already admitted about my drinking, that they were going to do a command referral if I didn’t just continue on with the self referral.

 So, off to rehab I went. It took about a month before they had an opening & I figured why stop drinking now if I’m gonna be away from it for a month anyways. I couldn’t even stay sober the night before. They breathalyzed everyone there before they got started and I was still drunk. So I spent most of my first day waiting in the hallway until I finally blew all 0’s. I felt I was just making things worse, but it probably helped me. Because going in, I didn’t want to be honest about my drinking anymore. I mean, it led me to their highest level of treatment. But it’s hard to lie about how much I drink when I’m showing up to rehab drunk. I wasn’t sure if anyone else there drank like me, but me & 1 other guy were the only ones waiting to sober up, so I knew something was wrong. I figured I might as well make the most of it and be truthful if I want help. I’m already here. & I should’ve went way sooner, instead of waiting so long. I needed it & I loved there. 

This was my first introduction to AA. After the 1st couple days they sent us to a meeting every night the rest of the time there. I went in with the intention of slowing down, but I quickly changed my thoughts on that when they started sending us to meetings. I finally heard people share how they drank & felt like I could relate. I have no control over how much I drink once I start & apparently when I try to stop I can’t stay stopped either. Maybe I should quit. It wasn’t enjoyable anymore anyways. & being in this rehab is making me feel so much better about myself. I learned so much. 

Leaving rehab they have us sign a contract that says we’ll stay sober for a year & they can randomly test us anytime throughout that year. I didn’t want to get into trouble. I felt like going to rehab looked bad enough, so I thought I could do that. I wasn’t planning on drinking anytime soon anyways. Part of the deal for me was also going to 2 AA meetings a week & meeting with a group counselor at the rehab building once a week. I didn’t think I needed them anymore. I already learned so much in rehab so I’d be fine. So I just showed up to get my paper signed & left once the meetings were over. The first 2 months were easy. Fresh out of rehab I still had no desires. But then I started to feel miserable again & I didn’t know why. My counselor asked me every week when I’d get a sponsor so at about 4 months sober I finally got one just so he’d stop asking. But I wasn’t willing to do all of the steps yet. I made it to step 4 and just stopped. I wasn’t ready to share this stuff with my sponsor. I didn’t even want a sponsor. 

At 5 months I convinced myself that my drinking only gets really bad after breakups. & with all the knowledge I had from rehab, there’s no way I’d let my drinking get as bad as it was before. I’d be able to control it this time. But once that first drink went down my throat, I was off to the races. The only controlling I did was not drinking when I knew I was gonna be tested. I thought I was clever looking up my own medical records since I had access. & I could see a week in advance whenever they put the order in for me, so I’d just stay clean for few days leading up & be fine. Other than those times to avoid trouble, I drank every single day. My counselor figured it out immediately, but he had no proof so I’d just deny it. I was gonna get away with it, & at the year mark I could drink stress free. I didn’t even enjoy getting drunk most days, but I didn’t care to stop anymore. I figured that’s just how my life was gonna be. It was better than being sober at the time. 

Only 2 months later, I was hungry one night & I didn’t have any food in my barracks room, so I guess I had to order out or go somewhere. I’ve driven drunk plenty of times & wanted to be cheap. There was a McDonalds right up the street so I’d be fine. I went outside to smoke in my car a bit before I left, & when I decided to leave I forgot to turn my headlights on. So they stopped me right at the gate, flickering his flashlight at my car. I realized what i forgot, so I turned them on and thought I’d be fine. But but he said you smell like alcohol, have you been drinking? & thought I’m already caught, but I don’t feel that drunk so maybe he’ll just turn me around. I said yes, but said I only had 2 shots. I honestly had no idea how much I really had, but I felt functional. He had me follow his finger with my eyes & step out and walk heel to toe in a straight line. I felt things were going well. Then he pulled out the breathalyzer. I blew .12 & I knew I was fucked. I felt my Navy career was probably over. But he thought the breathalyzer was messed up. He said I looked fine, and said we’d try again in a few minutes. But it didn’t make a difference.

 & that was my first & hopefully last experience being cuffed in the back of a police car. I was intrigued, & thought it was cool, but super fucking terrified & anxious of what was to come. They brought me to whatever office & had me blow again into a machine they said was more accurate. & even after waiting like half an hour I still I blew above the limit, so there was nothing they could do at that point. They had to fill out whatever paperwork & have my senior chief come pick me up. 

This was my only time getting into actual trouble in the Navy, so there was a small chance I might be ok, but I had no hope & only made it worse. I figured I failed my one year sober contract & got an alcohol related incident on base. My career was over. & it might not have been, but I only made it worse. I kept drinking for another month. I was convinced that alcohol wasn’t the problem. I just forgot to turn on my headlights & happened to be drunk. Plus everyone knew I drank again anyways, so now i can just drink whenever again. They set me up with another rehab meeting to see if I should go back, but I showed up drunk again from the night before. So obviously I wasn’t taking it seriously & they had my command pick me up & said they’d reschedule. I think that’s where I blew it, but everything happens for a reason. 

Almost a month after my ARI, I was considering suicide. I was so miserable & thought that was my best idea. But suicide was too scary to follow through with & I was tired of being so miserable. I was finally willing to do anything to stop drinking. I could not go on living the way I was. I just wanted my mood to improve. 

So I walked back into the rooms. At first I went to a couple meetings I’d never been to before to try and avoid any familiar faces. Which is weird because I never spoke to anyone except for the guy I asked to sponsor me, but it made sense at the time. I was so fucking down, ashamed, & hopeless. But after picking up that white chip & having people come up to me afterwards I felt welcomed. Relapse just happens to be a part of some people’s story. Not everyone’s, but it’s a part of mine. 

Then I went to a meeting where I ran into my old sponsor and, with my head down & not even making eye contact, shamefully asked him to sponsor me again. & he didn’t look down on me, or talk bad about me relapsing. He just said it was good to see me again & he was happy to sponsor me. So we started going through the steps. I got a homegroup and started doing service work. I was praying to something I wasn’t even sure existed. It took a while for me to actually believe in a higher power, but hey I was going through the motions until then. I just couldn’t stand how I felt anymore, so whatever he suggested I did. If it worked for him & others, maybe I should give it a try, no matter how dumb I initially thought it sounded. I was calling other people. going to so many meetings. we went EACYPAA. I actually made it through all the steps & I didn’t feel like shit anymore. They actually worked. 

In the background my life was getting better without much effort. I had my rescheduled appointment with the rehab counselor. This time with some sobriety & action behind it. They said going through treatment wouldn’t be any different than last time, so they didn’t think I needed it, but recommended I get back into the weekly group counselings & just continue everything I was already doing. I went to captains mast which I think is like Navy Court. I’m not sure if there’s a better way to describe it. But what they decided there was I couldn’t drive on base for year, half months pay for 2 months, and suspended reduction in rank. So I got to keep my rank as long as I stayed out of trouble. The civilian court then threw out my case because apparently after captains mast it’d be considered double jealousy. 

I did end up getting nonjudicial punishment though. This is where they decided if I should stay in or not & if not then what type of discharge. I was 3 months sober, but still expected the worst & somehow got an honorable discharge. Which is the best you can get. & I was in just over 3 years which is the minimum for 100% of the GI Bill. So I get to go to college for free now. I had several people speak up for me to talk about how I was at work & some to talk about the changes they’ve noticed. It’s true when they say others notice the changes before you do. What my sponsor, & counselors were saying was beautiful. I’d never heard someone I barely knew talk to highly of me. After everyone spoke & I answered some questions I had to step out while the decision was made. I was so nervous, but I knew whatever happened is exactly what was supposed to happen. It was so unexpected, & not exactly what I wanted, but it was better than I could’ve imagined. Idk how I got so lucky. I think that’s God. Idk how else to explain how things could’ve turned out that way. 

When my last day of the Navy came I was sad, anxious, nervous, & somewhat excited. What was I going to do next. I was in the middle of my amends. I could’ve easily said fuck it I don’t need to look good for the Navy anymore and started drinking again, but why give up now when everything I was doing was improving my mood. I loved how I felt & I never wanted to go back to having suicidal thoughts again. So I pushed through. I kept trudging along. I finished my amends up to that point, & continuously worked 10 & 11 for a while. But I didn’t want to do 12. I mean, I could work with others through service work, & making phone calls, or hanging out. That counts right. But how could I sponsor anyone? I had like 8 or 9 months when I finished the steps & there are people with way longer sobriety who’d make much better sponsors. & there’s no way I was going to share at meetings, when someone else would have a better message than me. I was unwilling to pay it forward. 

The desire to drink was gone for a while. I was content with what I was doing & didn’t feel I needed to add anything else. Eventually I started slacking. I still had problems making friends & fellowshiping with people.

But I always had one person who was calling me to go a meeting. He had a few months when I first came back & I think he saw how miserable I was, because he came up to me, we talked for a while, & he invited me to get some food that first night we met. I was still in the Navy at the time but couldn’t drive on base, so he helped me get to & from meetings. And I felt I had made my first sober friend since I was a child. I didn’t think that was possible. Someone actually wanting to spend time with me sober. I know it know it helping him stay sober & he was just trying to help a newcomer, but it made a huge impact on me in the beginning that someone I never met before would go out of their way to be so generous to me. He showed me that sobriety can be fun. We would hang out all the time with other alcoholics, go to meetings constantly, & he always called me out on my shit. The only problem was that he was still in the Navy. 

So whenever he deployed I stopped showing up to meetings. I should’ve learned from his actions & did those things for someone else, like he did for me. But for whatever reason, I just felt I couldn’t be that person for someone else. & I felt alone in the rooms. I didn’t think anyone else cared if I was there anyways & I didn’t want to go anymore. I even stopped calling my sponsor, only responding when he’d reach out & I didn’t always pick up. I stopped doing step work. I left my homegroup. I stopped praying. I stopped everything. I was walking towards my relapse before I even picked up again. When the urges came back, I didn’t fight it at all. I completely abandoned everything I knew that was helping me & my mind convinced me that drinking would be a good idea. 

I went back out & once again picked back up right where I left off. I was smoking weed & doing coke, which I’d never even done before, so that’s scary that I thought it was a good idea. This lasted about a month & a half. The suicidal thoughts came back & I knew I had to swallow my pride & just go back. It’s amazing how supportive and friendly everyone is. They just want to help each other & it’s beautiful. It makes so easy to walk back in without beating myself up to much. Some people don’t make it back, & i had to just be grateful that I did & push forward. 

I got my white chip & jumped into the steps even quicker than last time. I got a different sponsor because I wanted to try something different, but the steps don’t change. The suggestions mostly stay the same too. I made it through them in a month. I think I met up with this sponsor almost every day that month to just keep moving forward. I knew the steps worked and just wanted to get back into 10,11,12. Where I was before. I wanted to feel better again. My old homegroup welcomes me back & I got right back into service work. I’m praying (not as often as I should, but most days). I’m calling people again. 

However this time my sponsor suggested doing everything I did before & more. & working with others is where I seriously lacked before. I somehow got a sponsee recently and that terrifies me. But i just overthink things. I just have to take him through the steps the same way I was taken through the steps. it’s not like I’ll always have all the answers. That’s what my sponsor & other people are there for. We all help guide each other. 

Next step for me is working on sharing during the meetings. That still makes my heart race thinking about it during a meeting, but I’ll get there. Everyone has a message to share. No matter big or small. We’re there to carry on the message & give back what was freely given to us. This is my first time sharing my story. I thought putting it here might help make it easier to see where my thoughts go. & hopefully help me get more comfortable with opening my mouth during a meeting. Even if it’s just a quick 1 min share. I need to start somewhere. Progress, not perfection. 

I’ll be 2 months sober Friday & holy fuck I hope I don’t ever have pick up a white chip again. I tend to forget how bad it gets for me in my head out there, & I feel so much better when I’m just taking suggestions from other people. This program works. I just have to keep taking the actions, especially when I don’t want to. 

TLDR. Quiet kid. Loves alcohol. Can’t control intake & can’t stop on my own. Went to Rehab. 5 months dry on self knowledge. Relapse. 15 months sober working steps 1-11 for a while plus other suggestions. Stopped everything. Relapse. 2 months sober this Friday. Worked through all steps this time. Got a sponsee. Still need to work on sharing though. It fucking sucks out there. Keep taking the actions. Love you all

This shit will destroy you. I am 30 now, started drinking heavily and smoking from 17-18. I think I developed a depression. My day looks like this:

Go to bed at around 1-2 a.m.

\~7-8 a.m. is my anxiety induced wake up where I am in such panic that I think throwing myself of that fucking balcony would be easier than to go through it.  
\~7-8 to 7:30-8:30 - usually lats for about half an hour is the panic attack. Vomitting gall (brownish acid) in the balcony while I smoke a so needed cigarette that will calm me for at least 30 minutes, while it also causes my heart to race as fuck.  
\~8:30 - 9:30 - I blow out my nose, becase fucking snotty fluid and tears are comming from all the wholes in my cface. Try to drink water. Puke it out immediately after.  
\~09:30 - 10:30 - I rech under my bed where I have a litre of beer for the morning just to end this pain.  
10:30 - Beer downed. Brain is racing. I am thinking about various random shit. I.e. How is a chair screwed, how could I screw a chair in a right way. Absolutely useless random shit. Over and over and over.

11:00 - somehoe I feel a little better, but I haven't eaten anything. BUT. I know if I will eat, I will automatically feel worse just right after I finish my plate. IF I will finish it.  
12:00 - I have been working from home and was supposed to login to the system at 9, which I did, but I still haven't done any work. I take a lunch break, but I don't eat anything, because it will wear off immediately.

14:00 - It wore off even without eating. Check my wallet - no money. Wage is late. Start panicking. Go to neighbor, borrow 4 euros for 2 litres of beer.

14:30 - drank one liter, feeling my brain can work. Start working. Consuming strong beer by sip to maintain brain stability to work.

16:00 - another one. Acid reflux from 7,5% alcohol beer is hitting me, somehow I eat 3 sandwiches, automatically feel tired and sleepy. Cry for a bit. GEt myself together and call another client. Just two hours left.

18:00 - I still have a can of beer left for tomorrow to cancel this pain.   


00:00-01:00 - Watch a horror movie and fall asleep with heart pounding like a racecar. I smoked a whole pack today as well.  


Next morning: repeat. And wonder why am I still alive.  
I need help, but I can't miss a day at my job.

He lives two hours away. Last year I got a text “just wanted to you to know I love you.” That was maybe the 5th time he’s ever said that to me. Alarmed I call him right away. No answer. His girlfriend called later that day and said he got super drunk and tried to hang  himself.  He had sent that message to me, my mom, and his daughter. So I drive to him and he promised he would never do that again. We had lost a brother to suicide about 10 years ago. Too be honest, I’m still  have not recovered from the loss. 
        About a month ago his ex-girlfriend called me freaking out . He had told her he was going to kill himself. I try calling, no answer. I try texting no response. 4 hours later he text back that he was asleep but is fine. 
      Yesterday we all get the “I just wanted to let you know I love you.” Text again. I promptly called, voicemail. I texted, no response. His ex-girlfriend was on her way to my house with their children.  I keep trying to call and he turned his phone off. 4 hours later he sent a text. “I’m fine. I will be fine. Please let mom know. “
      I can’t keep going through this. I’m driving up to him this weekend. He has been a functioning alcoholic for years. On my last visit he said he was going to get help to try and get custody of his children . I told him how proud of him I was that he could admit he has a problem. He said he would only stop drinking temporarily in order to get his children.  When he drinks he gets really strict and mean. He also gets really depressed. I’m wanting to bring family with me to put on a sort of intervention. 
      Is this a good idea? Terrible idea? How can I actually help?  I don’t think he has many friends where he is living. He moved there with his girlfriend years ago and they started a family. They have since split but he won’t move back to his hometown because of the kids and his job.",1,0

If not, that's completely fine and all kind advice is welcome. My fiance's parents have been drinking for years now. They drink every day, every night. I have suffered with alcoholism personally and with my mom. Though I never dealt with withdrawals myself, my mom did when she detoxed. How should they go about this? I think two alcoholics trying to keep each other accountable is very difficult and not healthy, but isnt that what sponsorship is?  I can't imagine what trials they are going to witness. I think it would be a good idea for them to start going to AA or Grace Recovery and finding separate sponsors there. Is that a good plan? Also I feel like they should stop drinking together, and not separately. And if they can't do that, maybe one should live away from home until they can both stop? I really dont know, so I'm brainstorming. Any advice I would greatly appreciate. If you are Christian, please pray for them. Thank you all!",10,0

The first couple weeks were great, until the party weekends came. I noticed when we were out at his friends BBQ that he was drinking a lot. We got home, where he proceeded to continue drinking. Eventually I was tired, went upstairs to bed, and he showed up at 4 or 5am. The next night, pretty much the same thing, except I went downstairs at 2 or 3 to check on him and he was passed out with an almost empty bottle of Wild Turkey. 

He works during the week, so he doesn’t drink. On Monday evening I sat down and told him his drinking alone all night after going out  scared me. He told me he didn’t ever want me to be scared and that it wouldn’t happen again. Cue the following weekend— where he asked me to go watch football with him and his friends. Commence his drinking. He was again, downstairs alone drinking on the couch at the end of the night. This time, he was hiding the bottles of whiskey he was drinking. 

Then the next weekend, I have a friend who likes to go hunting and I brought him to meet up with my boyfriend, some of his friends, and I to watch football. My boyfriend was drinking, again. He began to belittle me, insult me for bringing a male friend to meet him (even though the purpose was to introduce them so maybe they could go hunting together) and to question my character, called me a shitty person, and went so far as accusing me of doing illicit drugs. 

I left, and he proceeded to take me on a roller coaster emotional ride via text, wherein he told me to come get my stuff, then not to come get my stuff, then that he wouldn’t let me get my stuff, then that he never wanted to see me again, and then that he just wanted to be on the couch watching movies with me. All over the place. I came get my stuff, and the next day he asked if we could talk. 

We met up Monday evening, I told him the alcohol had to stop. He agreed, even making a statement about “sober October”. Cut to Wednesday, he went on a day trip with his buddies out of town, very little contact, I know he was drinking with them at the bar they hung out at for 5 hours for “dinner”. He called me at 4:45am to let me know he was back at his hotel. The next day he called me around lunch, making plans for me to make dinner and for that night, but 2 hours later called to say that he wanted to have a bro night and that we would probably fight if I was around so “Can you just stay at your own place?” 

I havent really heard from him too much since that day, I suspect he’s still on a binge, as he tried to contact me last night at 3am. It’s a holiday weekend for him so I imagine he’ll finally be off the binge on Tuesday for work. But what do I do when Tuesday rolls around, as I know this will be the same story. It seems like every time he says he’s not going to drink, he looks for a loop-hole to do it. And right now, the loophole is to avoid me and act like I’m doing something to hurt him. I’d bet he’s going to call Tuesday and try to resume our normal weekday schedule, and it’ll be the same story again come Friday.

EDIT: I guess I’m looking for suggestions as to what to say to get out of this cycle on Tuesday when he apologizes again....or acts like the last 5-day binge and avoidance never happened.

**UPDATE: I heeded your Reddit advice. Also found out he had started talking to multiple other women during his bender. So that was an easy call at that point.",7,0

I’m a little over three years sober (6/13/16) and have been in a relatively good place since about 10 months out. But right now, for some reason, I’m experiencing a strange and rare craving to resume drinking again. I’m not planning to, but I know sitting on it will only make it worse. 

I think it stems from being pretty overwhelmed right now. I have a lot going on (mostly good) and I’m just struggling to stay balanced. I haven’t really been active in 12 step since the first year, did RR for a little while, but it’s been quite a while. I haven’t had time to exercise regularly and have not been meditating. Sleep is averaging about 5 1/2 hours a night most nights and not much time for chilling. Just a lot right now, and I think I just feel a pull to check out a little.

The premise is that you find out who your real friends are when you lose everything. Of course the punchline is that he looks around and says to himself ""these are my real friends?""

I ultimately decided to not say anything about it and just live my goddamn life. 

So we sit down together, of course he's already on his third pint because he got there 15 minutes earlier than I did. I proceeded to order a nice big bottle of Pellegrino. I was actually glad that they had it on the menu. Anyway, he looked at me and says: "" what are you some kind of faggot?"" Standard stuff. I just tried to move past it and not take the bait. I didn't feel like getting into it. 

To make a long story short, for the next hour and a half every time I took a sip of my drink he looked at me with distrust. He was actually sneering at me at times . On top of that, he was absolutely hostile towards me. He spent most of the evening just going on and on about how great he was at everything while he sucked back about seven pints. When it came time for me to talk about things that I was working on he was extremely critical. It was actually pretty awful because I was talking about some creative endeavors and he just shit all over them and told me how none of them would work. I actually didn't want to even talk about any of my creative stuff, it was my other really good friend who was there that actually brought everything up. It was actually surreal watching my good friend arguing on my behalf for the validity of my endeavours. 

Of course, what I really wanted to talk about was how much my life has improved since I quit drinking. I wanted to talk about the twenty pounds that I've lost, the fact that my wife and children are much closer to me now, the fact that I don't need to nap at all in the daytime. The fact that I've had more professional success in the last year than I've had in 20 years. I could go on and on. Those are the things that actually interest me now. But no, I edited all of that out and really just tried to keep the conversation focussed on his stuff. But I had a sense during the evening that this would be a long goodbye and that this friendship cannot survive my sobriety. And of course at the end of the evening, I jumped in my truck and drove home without even thinking twice about it as he  sat there and did the mental arithmetic to try to decide how far he could drive based on"" how much he had consumed, how long he was there, how many cops might be around etc.."".I don't miss that stuff.

I kind of rolled around last night thinking all of this over. 
I was overwhelmed with anger and grief. I was really angry at this guy because of the way he treated me. I wasn't looking for a fight, I really just wanted to catch up on old times. And of course the grief over the fact that this is a relationship that's over. The times that we spent in the past all revolved around drinking. I cannot go back to that and he can't handle the way things are now. So we're done and that's fucking sad. As I watched him pound  pint after pint  my resolve to never drink again only strengthened. Of course his alcoholism has progressed since the last time that I've seen him as it always does. It's sad that it's progressive, I think if it wasn't , all of us here could probably be enjoying it in moderation. 

Perhaps I should have just been completely honest and said to him "" listen man I had to quit drinking because I couldn't control it anymore. Whatever you're doing is fine but for me I just can't do it anymore. "" Maybe the fact that I didn't mention it was a mistake on my part? Maybe it just left a big elephant in the room. I don't know, I guess I'll never know. But I do know one thing. I am so sick and tired of walking around on eggshells and giving everybody else the benefit of the doubt.   Giving everybody else excuses for acting like shit and for saying shitty things. I'm sick of saying things like "" well it's their own insecurities talking "" or how they're just jealous or envious , they're still great people blah blah blah.

 I'm tired of it. If you've got insecurities, if you're consumed with envy, if you've got things in your life that you aren't proud of, if you've got things in your life that haven't worked out or aren't working out you have no excuse to be hostile towards other people. I'm sorry. So fuck this guy, I'm sure lots of you on here I've been through similar experiences. Sorry for the long post, just needed to vent today. Goddamn it I'm sad about this",43,0

I’m a fun drunk, so I don’t tend to get complaints. Lately, I’ve been drinking more frequently to deal with depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and work stress. I have been putting back large amounts of alcohol just to feel something as well. 

I woke up with a scrape down the side of my car a month ago. I drove home drunk so I assumed it was me. Turns out it wasn’t but I still decided to cut back and not drive. That lasted about a week or two. Then I got upset at my boyfriend and refused to talk to him about it. When I finally decided to talk, I had to be tipsy (ended up drunk) and it took me two days to get my point across and clear the air.

This week I found myself in a situation with a friend that I never thought would happen. I went to get something I forgot at his house. Fast forward through two and a half bottles of wine and no dinner, I can barely see and he’s got his hands all over me. I had no desire to sleep with him, but somehow I end up naked in his bed before I even have a chance to realize what’s going on. I know that we didn’t end up having full on sex but the rest of the night is still hazy. 

So now I’m here. I’ve been crying off and on for days debating what to do and switching between feeling like an assault victim and blaming myself. In any event, I’m filled with intense shame and regret. I’ve been sober for a couple days, but as more time goes on, I think that if I cut back again I’ll be fine. My mom is coming into town and I know I’ll drink with her. She’ll know something’s up if I don’t and I can’t talk about this.

I know I have a problem. I know I need to slow down. My dad and my grandparents are alcoholics but I didn’t think I would ever be one too. Dad’s been in the program for a few decades now, so I asked him for his advise the morning after. We didn’t actually end up talking about it, but now I can’t bring myself to. I don’t know that I’m an addict. I don’t drink every day and I’ve got a great career and support system. My friends and BF don’t see me as out of control. Either they’re right or I’ve gotten good at hiding things. I’m not sure what rock bottom feels like, but I’m feeling pretty low right now. I guess the question is can I hit pause and come back without being in the exact same place a year later?",5,0

I relapsed around a month (maybe more who knows I've been in bed mostly and can't keep track of time) So my family started giving me sippy cups of vodka and we got it down to maybe 15 drinks a day and then I felt good enough to switch to beer. So I did and went down to around 7. Straight to 15 to that.I don't have the list on hand currently but it was around that. Then I started feeling the absolute worst I've ever felt in my life. I couldn't drink the beer, my muscles were so sore (not the good kind you get after a workout), skin was insanely prickly, I couldn't move, hot, cold, and sweaty. I keep a punching bag in my bed, I know that sounds silly but I busted the wall the other day so I figured that would help. Also keep weights next to me to help. Only able to do this because I had to switch back to vodka because I can't stomach beer 

Anyways! To the point and NSFW btw. 

Recently felt good enough to ejaculate Haven't been able to in a good while. Mind you I'm a 22 year old male with normally good working parts. Well when it shot out it was quite bloody. I looked it up and it sounds like it usually isn't serious, but I was wondering if it could be anything booze related. I had all the zillion blood work tests and x-rays and stuff maybe a few months ago and everything was pretty good. Liver levels were high of course. I've never detoxed without being in the hospital so I'm worried I overdid it or something? I've never felt so awful! But I'm sure that's how it goes. 

My nose also keeps bleeding. Not sure if that's related, but it's all clogged up with blood and that's all I can taste.

Sorry for the book, but feeling decent enough to actually read a page of text. The blood just freaked me tf out.

Update: Much less blood today guys! Probably wasn't too serious.",3,0

I feel completely uncertain of my choices, and having to actually deal with life has got me on the ropes.

I pray this reaches whoever it needs to.,"A few hours ago, I received a call I never wanted to get. I learned that an amazing man — my second father — passed away after relapsing. His health was failing so he went on one last bender. He drank so much alcohol that he passed out on the couch, sitting up, and when his head slumped forward his airway was cut off. He was drunk enough that he didn’t wake up from it, and died in his sleep. 

I write this in tears... It’s one thing to read about it, and another to go through it. There’s a part of me that expected something like this to happen, because I’ve known him for 20+ years and watched his on again/off again relationship with sobriety. This time, we all hoped it would really stick. He would say things like, “I just like who I am so much more when I’m drinking.” Really, I just think he was very lonely and suffered from a lot of mental health issues on top of trying to live with the many trials that came with HIV. I think that he was sick. I think he lied to himself a lot about what a “burden” he was to his family and friends. 

I don’t remember him for all his drinking. I remember what it was like to be a little girl and see him with his husband, and to see how insanely happy he was compared to the people I went home to. I remember the trips he invited me on because my family and I never did things like that, and he just wanted to show me how families were supposed to act — even slightly dysfunctional ones. He picked on me, made me feel stupid sometimes, knew my embarrassing secrets, and never once treated me like I was just another friend of his daughter’s. He always introduced me as his “other” daughter.

What I regret most right now is not telling him enough how much he meant to me. I’m mad that I didn’t reach out, or say I was proud of him enough. I let our relationship slide into random encounters because, “life just happens.” In one phone call, I learned what was really going on in his life aside from all the small talk, and now it’s to late to tell him that I care. 

I wanted to share this to this group, because I myself know what he felt when he fought to resist taking a shot at 9AM. I’m a recovering alcoholic, my husband is a recovering alcoholic, my mother-in-law, my father; my friends, my distant relatives, and my late grandfather. I know where his head was at when he slipped into depression and told himself he wasn’t good enough for the people who loved him, because of his mistakes and his erratic behavior. To me, he was more than good enough. He was somebody who shaped my life into something completely different and who cared when he could have turned the other cheek or stayed at arms-length away. 

So, again... I’m sharing to this group because some of you might be feeling like he did, or how I have many times before. Whether you’re lonely, stressed, on edge, or dealing with a world that is falling down around you... You might be thinking that the old ways were better ways. Let this be your affirmation that they’re not; it’s not worth it. For myself and his loved ones, the sun isn’t shining as brightly as it did before he passed away. He was never a burden, just, sometimes we forget to do the right thing by letting our tribe know how ripped apart we would be if something ever happened to them. 

You have to bury those thoughts sometimes. I mean, think about it: maybe he did like himself more when he was drinking, but all of us really liked when we could call him. I’m still fighting the urge to message him or go to his house, to yell at him for giving in or to help him like I really wish I could. You have to bury those thoughts so your loved ones don’t have to bury you. 

I hope this reached whoever it needed to. Please, please remember your worth and remember that you might be changing the lives of people you never expected to. It’s to late for us, and for him, but it’s never too late for you. Call the people you need to. Tell them that you love them or that you need help, if you do. Hell, message me if you need to. I’ll be your other daughter. I’ll be your family if you need one. Just for today, remember what you’re fighting for, and please don’t give up.",21,0

In 2015, I joined the navy at 19 years old. I had never drank on my life. I left home and was on my own. It was hard, being pretty much ripped away from family and sent to a new state. I got very depressed very quickly. When I went home on leave, it was like the depression would be lifted. At home on leave is when I started drinking. I only went home every couple months so I wasn't drinking heavily. 

Then, something snapped in my brain. I stopped going home as often, and the depression got very *very* heavy. I was still not 21 so I would have a friend go to a liquor store for me. It started off fun. I would drink alone and just chill, watch some movies, etc. 

Once I turned 21 is when it got really bad because I didn't need to rely on anyone. Alcohol made me feel good, great actually. It numbed my mind, made me forget where I was, forget my feelings. It got to a point where I was going through 3-4 bottles of hard liquor a week. I couldn't stop myself. 

Every night i would drink. I needed it, bad. It started severely effecting my life. I would go into work still damn near drunk. (Which was extremely dangerous since my job in the military was working on aircraft)

I met a guy who I started getting serious with. (We ended up getting married!) I knew it got bad when I started needing to hide my drinking. From him, my parents, my friends. I would sneak shots from the bottle while he went to the bathroom. I couldn't control myself. He went on deployment in December 2018, and that's when it got extremely bad. Every. Single. Night. Shot after shot after shot. I didn't care. I was severely depressed, gaining weight, wanted to kill myself, always hoping I would just fucking die in my sleep already. 

The terrible hangovers wouldn't stop me either. I would wake up and think ""damn I'm never doing this again"". And once it wore by the time I got off work, I would stop by the liquor store on the way home and drink alone, into oblivion. 

Earlier this year, my uncle passed away due to an alcohol related injury. I knew alcoholism ran in my family, but I didn't know to what extent. My dad's parents were both alcoholic. Now my uncle. He had fallen and hit his head. They found mounds of empty liquor bottles in his apartment upon arrival. He was pronounced dead days later. 

I was constantly asking myself if I had a problem. Googling ""am I an alcoholic?"" I was in denial. I had a revelation one night. I could not continue down this path. I was killing myself. I needed to break the cycle. And I ended up being successful. Here's what I did that helped me: 

The first thing I did was research the long term side effects of drinking. We all know that drinking is bad. But when you see it in black and white, laid out in front of you, it's like staring at a final boss you know you will never overcome if you don't stop drinking. I took it to heart. Liver failure, brain damage, heart disease, stroke, injury, the list goes on. 

Next, I sat down and wrote out the pros and cons of drinking, and my goals. Pros were: short term enjoyment, numbing of senses. The list of cons was very long. Family history, mental health, death, etc. I taped it to my freezer where I usually kept my bottles. Writing down and visualizing your goals helps a lot. A goal I wrote down was achieving mental clarity. 

The next and absolute hardest step is *wanting* to quit, and making the conciousness effort to drive past the liquor store on the way home. My first sober nights were filled with insomnia, regret, stomach and head aches, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. But waking up sober and clear minded was the most euphoric and exciting thing I had experienced in a long time. 

The first few days are extremely difficult. But every day, I would read what was taped on the freezer door. I would weigh myself at work every couple days, and the weight was shedding off fast once I stopped drinking. That helped a lot too. It's nearly instant gratification. I lost a total of 16 pounds. 

Nowadays, I am much happier, healthier, skinnier, and all around feel incredible. It has been the best decision of my life, taking those first steps. During that time, I was seeing a therapist. It was free because I was in the military. I understand getting to see a therapist might be difficult for some people. So I would recommend talking to someone you're close to for support. Tell them the truth, your goals, anything. It helps a lot knowing someone out there believes in you, and that you're not alone. Hell, you can even message me if you need to. 

Know that it *is* possible. And recognizing you need help is the first step, whether it be going to a hospital or deciding on your own that you can do it. It takes a lot of self control, strength, and discipline. But it is possible. And things do get better. It's a hard cycle to break, and it's not easy. But it is worth it. Very very worth it. 

I hope this helps someone out there who feels helpless or alone. Know that you're not.",39,0

She refuses to go to AA with me.,"My good friend has severe alcoholism and it is affecting her life to a a great extent. It has led to her divorce and she's going to be kicked out of her home. She admits she has a problem and wants help. She has agreed to go to AA meetings with me twice, but both times she has backed out.

The problem is she is an immigrant with a green card. She is afraid she is about to lose this because of the divorce and she doesn't want attention from people who might report her or hurt her in some way legally. She earned her green card and does not want to go back to the country she came from. I told her she would not have to give a real name or any information about herself, but she argued that she has to say something about herself, otherwise they can't help her.

She has said she would talk to someone one-on-one about her issues, but I don't think she could afford a therapist.

Is there something I can tell her about AA, or some other way I could help her? She has faced anti-immigrant sentiment in the past and I don't doubt it could happen in this situation as well. I really want to help her, she is suffering so badly.",2,0

My family relationships are trashed and pretty much no existent at this point but my work ones are thriving. 

If I fake if for another year or so while drinking heavily would it not be best to address it when my debts and future are taken care of?

I just wanted to share my story of my struggles with alcohol. I want to finally share my story with the world and get this off my chest. I hope by sharing my story it’ll inspire some of you. Sorry if this is really long.

I’m only 21 years old. Which is really young to think I have a drinking problem and for a while I was in denial.  I had my first drink when I was about 17 in my friends basement. It was harmless fun. 
The first time I drank too much was at my brothers graduation party. I ended up getting black out drunk and passing out and waking up in my vomit. It was the first time I got yelled at for my drinking. I just brushed that off as getting too drunk my first time. 

I would rarely drink after that maybe once in a blue moon in my friends basement. Until I turned 18. (March 2016) Which is the  legal age in Canada. I had a small party for my birthday and had a few drinks. It was a really fun night, and nothing bad happened. Every few weeks I would have my friends over and we would drink and play games. It was fun during those times. I realized that alcohol made me into the person that I wanted to be... or so I thought. Normally I’m a quiet, and don’t really talk.  When I drank alcohol it gave me this confidence to be more talkative, fun, and loud. 

During the summer of 2016 I went to the Dominican Republic for a graduation trip. We stayed at an all inclusive resort which meant alcohol all day and all night. I would only get drunk at night when he parties where about to happen. One night I ended up blacking out and getting really aggressive. I guess I started punching my friend and telling her how much I hated her. The guys next door to us has to come stop me because I was being to wild trying to jump off the balcony. I felt awful the next day after learning this. I’m not sure why I did what I did, I think I maybe was lowkey still upset at something she did earlier that day. 

Months later me and my friends decided to go out to the bar for he first time. The bar we went to had a bad reputation at the time for being a sketchy bar. But I didn’t really think so because I enjoyed myself that night. The bar eventually went under new management and was renamed, but it still had the same reputation. I would eventually become a regular at this bar with another one of my friends who we will call Anika. 

Anika was my friends who I would drink with in her basement. She was a bit of a “bad” influence on me. She was the reason I smoked weed and drank for the first time. I’m not saying she made me do this because I have my own free will but I felt more inclined to do these things when I was with her. 

Me and Anika would start drinking more casually than we did since we were legal. We would usually go on adventures and drink. Either just us or sometimes with our boyfriends.. we would usually have a 2/6 of vodka we would all share, or a Mickey and have it with a cooler of some sort. 

It was just before the New year of 2017 and I started to take antidepressants. 
I was told to not drink alcohol with my antidepressants, it even says in the bottle. But I don’t listen and decided to go out drinking with my boyfriend and friend. I ended up getting way too drunk, throwing my drink in someone’s face, crying, getting kicked  out, running away to cry behind a gas station, coming back (good security), as making my friends leave back home. Since then it has just been a downhill battle with alcohol. 

Me as my boyfriend stated drinking more regularly together. Which when I drank I would get upset over the smallest things causing fights between us. Eventually one day it happened again and I being dramatic. He ended up breaking up with me the next day on valentines. I was super depressed and tried to kill myself. I still didn’t think alcohol was the problem. We did get back together after me convincing him. It only lasted for a month. 

The summer of 2017 is when my alcohol problems really started to show. I started going out to the bar with Anika. We would usually try and pre drink before hand and also we would hide our bottles in the bush to drink so we didn’t have to pay for drinks and could drink more. We usually drink a Mickey of vodka chased with a Mickey of sour puss. 
We would usually go out atleast once- four ones a week. I would have FOMO if my friends went without me. I would sometimes even go alone. During this time we started experimenting with drugs like molly, acid, and coke. I honestly thought by doing all his was cool. I thought the more drugs and alcohol your can do at once you’re so cool and so “woke”. I still didn’t think about it this was problem. Despite the fact all my money would go to drugs and alcohol. I had bruises all over my body from blacking out, I would wake up feeling like shit and sleep the day away only to go back out and do it all again. Not to mention I lost atleast 8 phones from going out. Oh and I almost forgot about the time I drank too much, passed out and ended up in the hospital

Fall of 2017
Eventually my drinking started to affect my family. I would come home drunk sometimes waking up my family or getting into fights. My mom didn’t like this and eventually told me to stop coming home drunk . So what did I do? I just would sneak back in. Until one night I was blackout and tried to break into my sisters room freaking her out. 
I was told to stop drinking all together but I didn’t want to do that. I would secretly drink I’m my room because I was bored or wanted to drink. If I went out I would usually wait until my mom went to sleep to sneak out. I would usually go because at the time there was this really hot bartender I was infatuated with. 

The first time I realized my drinking might be a problem was when I was at my friends house playing drinking games. It was fun. I remember grabbing the bottle of honey Hennessy thinking this is were I black out. The next thing I remember is coming to and I was on top of my friend (well call Alexis)screaming and hitting her. I ran away from my fiends house. The next morning I woke up instantly feeling bad. I knew I did something wrong I just didn’t know what happened. When I tried to ask them they just ignored me. Eventually Alexis told me what I did to her. I ended up freaking out at her because she was on the phone with her girlfriend, I ended up peeing on her and then beating her up. Alexis was the same friend I was previously beat up in the Dominican. Our other friends had to pull me off of her. I ended up running away keying alexis’ car in a fight of rage.

This was another moment I realized that maybe I have a bit of a problem. I stopped for a while to prove to myself I can stop and to show those friends I can change. I eventually moved out in March of 2018 on my own. I thought moving out would help me be more responsible. 
I eventually became friends again with Alexis and life was good. 

I started to drink again. I would drink when I came home from work. I would drink when I was bored. I would drink if I was sad. I would drink before hanging out with friends. I would drink while with friends. I think I started to drink because it made me more social and I thought nobody would wanna hang around me because I’m quiet which means I’m boring.  I was still taking antidepressants this entire time. Usually when I would drink it would make happy but if I got triggered I would either get really upset or go into a rage. Me Alexis would Hang our all the time. She knew I was drinking again but she thought I was doing better and so did I. One day I was drinking and I got triggered over somthing which lead me to freak out on Alexis and scream at her. She took my apartment keys and locked me out of my building so she could go get her stuff because I was freaking out on her and she was scared to get hurt. Which is fair but it only made me angrier. I called the cops on her for stealing my keys.
I guess that was the last straw for her because she told me that she didn’t hate me or wasn’t mad at me. She just didn’t want to be my friend. Honestly it broke my heart worse than any breakup. I was so sad and felt abandoned. I continued to drink. I knew I shouldnt because everytime I drank I felt like I was doing something bad and didn’t want anyone to know I was drinking. It also started to affect me financially. I would choose to buy alcohol over food or rent. Which I ended up taking out loans only to get myself into a lot of debt

Around fall of 2018 my mom brought me to a councillor. I thought it was for my depression. I’ve been depressed for so long I just didn’t know that  was depressed until I seen the doctor who prescribed me antidepressants. The antidepressants did help my mood when I was sober but I when I drank I would go crazy. This therapist did start to help me with my mental illnesses. I didn’t realize the reason I was there was to get help for my drinking. When I did I was a bit taken back and in denial still. Yes I had a problem with alcohol but there’s no way I can be an alcoholic. An alcoholic is someone who drinks everyday and is dependant. That wasnt me. 
 One of the final straws that made me realize that I really needed help and to stop my drinking was Christmas of 2018.
I was going to my moms house to spend the night with my family. I had drunken before hand to be more sociable but when I got there we all started taking shots. My mom told me to control myself that night and I said I would. But like usual I got way too drunk and freaked out on my brothers girlfriend. I got sent home that night and was basically shunned from jointing Christmas. I say all alone in my room crying feeling like a piece of shit. It made me feel bad to be this person. To be hurting those closest to me. Did everyone see me as this bad person? Because that’s not who I am. I am more than this addiction. Since the new year I have really been working o improving myself and my life for the better. I. The last year I have learned so much through therapy. I didn’t know much about what childhood traumas where. But I realize now since birth I’ve been pretty traumatized. My birth mother drank with me in the womb so I have fetal alcohol syndrome. I probably should look into it more but I feel like I’m addicted to alcohol. It’s my vice. I’ve tried other stronger drugs but alcohol is the only thing I crave so much that I think about when I’m going to be able to have my next drink. My childhood growing up wasn’t the greatest either. I was the black sheep of the family, the one to always be blamed and yelled at. My teenage years I spent depressed wanting to kill myself. When I finally discovered alcohol I think I began using it as a way to cope and not feel sad anymore. Little did I know it would only make things much worse. 

Now here I am 21 years old. Alcohol has controlled my life for the the last 2 years. I don’t want it to continue too.
I can either continue down this path and end up like my birth mother who is a homeless drug addict or like my adoptive mom (her sister) who got out of that lifestyle and is now successful.
I’m scared for it to get worse or ruin any other relationship. I just started to see this new guy and he’s awesome. The other night I got drunk and was being dumb and was scared he was going to breakup with me or leave me because of how I was acting. 

I’ve been trying to stop drinking for so long by myself that I think I need a support group or people who understand what I’m going though. I don’t think my friends understand that It’s not that I don’t want to drink it’s that I can’t.

Thanks for listening to my story. I hope that maybe it can be a bit of an eye opener of how traumas left unhealed can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms. I hope any of you dealing with similar situations can get the help you need to live your best life.",7,0

I really have to type this out to someone. This is my very first post on Reddit, and I feel like my life is slipping away from me. What do you guys think?

I never had a of problem with alcohol (I think). I used to be able to grab a six pack, sit back and watch a couple of movies, and then I wouldn't even want to drink for a long period. I could easily go a couple of months without drinking, and didn't even have to think about it. I was never much a party animal or anything like that, and never was big on bars. I didn't even like alcohol very much. I would just turn it down more often than not, even it was free. It would make me queasy half of the time.

However, over the last year I think I have become an alcoholic or at least a serious alcohol abuser. One year ago I was a single 31 year old guy who had a decent job, no debt, and got along great with my coworkers and friends. I used to smoke a lot of weed in the past, but for whatever reason my desire to do so began fading around age 30-31. But as luck has it, I suddenly developed a new desire to drink alcohol. It was like as soon as the desire for weed left, I started wanting to drink and it just hit me like a train. It just started affecting me differently for some reason and alcohol began to feel really good.

I specifically remember getting whiskey for Thanksgiving 2018 and spent the day off of work and watched some old Western movies by myself. No big deal I thought. But for some reason, it was like from that point on I started drinking very frequently, and the amount and frequency increased to where I was drinking more or less daily by sometime in January 2019.

I moved into a newly created sales position at my same company in January, cold-calling people all day. It turned out to be nothing like what I was promised. As the position was consolidated over the next couple of months the true details new position became cemented by upper management, and it became apparent that I was effectively getting a paycut, and had to hit ridiculous numbers like so many sales positions demand of you. I really felt lied to and even though I could pull it off, I hated the work either way. It screwed up my confidence so much, and my positive ""let's-do'it"" demeanor really changed, and I started getting more and more depressed, regardless of how much I tried to keep up appearances. I met a girl at my company and started dating her and had lots of good times with her, but for whatever reason my drinking continued to escalate.

We went to a sales conference on the other side of the country (Florida) in late March, and I spent the entire time drunk from morning to night. My girlfriend was there too, but I don't think she knew I was also hitting up restaurants in during brunch time and grabbing beer then as well. I would later on meet up with her, take her to dinner, and drink more.

So since then in March my drinking skyrocketed. I used to be 6'4 and a slim 200, but within two months I gained 50 pounds and had to buy all new jeans, dress shirts, etc. because my old stuff won't even fit me anymore. My whole personality has changed, and so has my sex drive and my zest for life. I began to grow distant from my girlfriend and eventually just stopped caring in June. I was just sitting around drinking. I told her I started drinking heavily and really needed help, and she told me she wanted to break up. I didn't even care, the whole time I was just thinking about when the conversation would be over so I could go get drunk. 

So I told my boss I was drinking too much, and needed help, and I went on leave from work for two months. Of course, I thought I would just stop drinking during that time, start meditating again, get a healthy diet again - but you guessed it, I spent the whole time getting wasted by myself, watching porn, listening to music. On July 4th, I sat there by myself and drank a total of 30 beers and ciders. No joke. I had so much depression and anxiety, that I couldn't even go out to do anything. ""What was the point?"", I thought. I couldn't just have one drink, I had to get really drunk, even thought it wasn't fun I just kept doing it. Within 9 or 10 months I have gone from having no debt to racking up over $10,000 in credit card debt, mostly from drinking and ordering food from restaurants to eat when drunk.

Fun fact: My dad is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for over 30 years, and my grandfather died in his sleep from drinking. So, yes, it's in my family for sure. During my leave I reached out to my dad and kept telling him I was slipping into heavy drinking. He has always been a good guy and very supportive, but I don't think he understood the scope of what I was doing. I eventually came back from leave to my job and still hated it. So I went on leave again and this time decided to fly out to see my parents in Maryland, with the idea that I needed some support from my family, and that I would stop drinking during my week there. Instead I showed up and drank a 12-pack each night at their house. They became very concerned. Within a week of returning from that trip I just broke down crying in the Target shopping center and called each of them, feeling suicidal. I have scheduled another flight to go see them on October 12th, this time for two weeks, and they specifically told me I can't have any alcohol in the house and I need to use the time to sober up.

I really don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I had anxiety and some before my drinking escalated, and drinking has really made them several times worse. When I was in my early 20's I went on antidepressants and they never helped me. I changed my life back then by eating healthy (vegetables, green juice), and by meditating and trying to get out. I know I have to do the same thing now, but I just can't stop drinking. Hopefully during my next trip to my parents on the 12th I can get two weeks under my belt, and really make a permanent change. I really feel like I have become someone who can either drink all the time, or not at all. It's like there's no in between for me, and the craziest part is I don't even like it when I'm drunk, and it has all happened so suddenly. I feel so depressed when I'm not drinking and just feel like a failure.

Thanks for listening. I am open to all suggestions/support.",7,0

I binge drink so much until I black out. I know it's bad. I do it to try and drown out my depression/anxiety/general shit life. I know the whole borderline personality disorder doesn't help with it either. I have been passively suicidal for a long time.

I'm already on a med to help supposedly curb alcohol cravings. But on Saturday night I was invited out for drinks. I said fuck it sure why not. I don't remember anything after my FOURTH drink. That is so unlike me. Not to toot my own horn, but that is small numbers. I might have been drugged. I honestly don't know. Long story short. I could have possibly been sexually assaulted. Via what my roommate has told me.

So I went the ER and got checked out.
Got all the std meds, shots, plan b, etc.
I don't want to file a police report because I was so far gone I have no memory of what happened and I don't want to potentially ruin someone's life over he said she said. But man. I fucked up so bad.

I have been just roaming around the house doing absolutely nothing since then. Called out of work until friday. I don't know how to handle anything. This is such a small town. Rumours are probably already spread and it is just another thing for me to be ashamed about. I feel like I can't even leave my house because I will just be judged to oblivion.

I know I can't drink anymore.

My husband (41) gently told me (33f)  it’s time i stop drinking a couple weeks ago and i gloriously fucked that up last night. I had some wine yesterday during a football game, which he was fine with, then proceeded to get hammered when i was out with my friends. He picked me up and i guess i told him i wanted to stay with my friends and being married was different and i didn’t like it. We have been married 6 months, together 7.5 years. So clearly i do have a problem because i would NEVER say that sober. 

I love my husband and love being married to him. What i meant was i wanted to stay with my friends, not get picked up like a kid from a playdate to go eat at the same boring restaurant with the same people we always hang out with. I love those friends, too, but i was with friends from years ago that i haven’t seen in ages and that particular group got me through a lot of stuff. 

So i feel like shit today. Considering i don’t remember saying what i said, i have accepted i have a problem. I don’t drink alone, i don’t always have to have alcohol, but i am a social partier who has no self control with alcohol. Its shit faced or nothing. There is no in between. My husband threatened to leave me as me getting too drunk and being a bitch has become a recurring thing. 

I need to stop drinking. I hurt him and im so upset with myself. I have a long history of mental health problems - depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder - and am known to be quite self destructive. I need to change this. I drink because for the first few hours, I’m happy and funny. I don’t know when to quit and it always goes to hell. 

I need help. How do you still go out with everyone else drinking? How do you deal with the “oh you’re not drinking?!” How do i move forward? I’m in the process of finding a therapist. I would like to stay out of rehab because of my job.

But now what? Im home and I have the meds my doctor thinks will help but what happens now? Im scared of the withdrawals. My doctor did say that drinking a beer or 2 a few days for the first 2 weeks might help me taper. Should I do that? Im afraid if I have a beer or 2 itll turn into 10 like always but my doc doesnt want me doing it cold turkey. (He said he trusts me so now id feel even more like shit if I messed it up 😣)

His drinking combined with cocaine use was getting every time more intense, untill the point he decided to go to rehab. Even then he would always complain saying that addiction is not a disease and abstinence was never the answer, he claimed that would just easily learn to use alcohol and drugs in moderation. What was making me nervous is the fact that, even before treatment, his biggest desire was to be able to drink again. Unfortunately he gave up on this idea a couple weeks later, while we were waiting.

3 weeks ago, he Od'd. He left the hospital straight to a temporary rehab. He's been having good and bad days there, sometimes wanting to quit, but mostly staying firm and even accepting the treatment and some of the 12steps. Now his transfer for a great rehab has been set up and it's all ready for him to move on thursday, but since he knew that, he insisted on leaving monday because he says the current place makes him worse (I don't doubt it, though), and has just told me he wants to drink before the transfer. I said it was a bad idea and he started to cry and tell me I see him as a disabled/sick person who needs constant vigilance, and proceeds to heavily criticize the treatment and say it's not helping him.

I don't see him like that, it's just that I am VERY concerned that his main thought is always to be able to drink again. He says that I should be with him when he drinks to ""control"" the ammount, but my experience has shown me every time he starts drinking, I can't say a word about it, because if I do, he would be absolutely angry.

&#x200B;

 He is an extremely special and great person, but at the same time, a huge stubborn. I am afraid that after the treatment on the new rehab, he will feel it's not a problem and start it over again. 

&#x200B;

What should I do? Just ""let"" he do it again during these days, just for him to have a lapse of reason again and see it's a problem and accept the treatment, or I should do something about it? I am really getting very tired of all this.",1,0

Should I wait until I graduate to get sober? Should I try moderation again? (Any tips on that btw?) should I start seeking help now? Anything would help. I’m hungover and helpless.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advise and support :) because of your comments, I made an appointment with one of the psychologists on campus and my first therapy session is in two weeks. Hopefully I can start treating this at the source.",2,0

As he’s aged he’s started drinking more and more. He likes to party - he’s very gregarious and enjoys good wine. But he drinks every single night. Every night. And he used to drink half a bottle, now he drinks two thirds or 75%. He cries a lot while he’s drinking or seems a little out of control sometimes. He can’t stay awake past 8:00, and he’s an old guy, but not that old. 

He’s not really facing any serious consequences to his drinking. He has a good job and he never drinks so much he’s wasted. But it just makes me... sad that he’s tipsy every day. That he never spends a whole day sober, and he can’t. That his personality after thirty years of drinking is sort of warping into a clown version of himself. That he’s aging himself. That he doesn’t have control over himself.

227,2019-10-02 17:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/dcgu8x/on_cutting_back/,On Cutting Back...,"I want to preface this by saying I do not want to encourage anyone to try cutting back vs. being 100% sober if sober is the way to go for you. I think the people on here are incredible veterans and I don’t mean to be counterproductive or disrespectful to anyone who’s kicking ass at being sober...

That being said, for me, I’ve been cutting back consistently since 2016. This is what I’ve been doing and what I’ve been experiencing in terms of challenges and successes. 

I chose to cut back because I wanted to give “moderation” a real shot first and see how it goes. I’ve been known to get blackout drunk at parties and I’ve been avoiding big gatherings like those for a long time. 2016 was the worst year of my life (for personal reasons) and I was drinking daily for most of it. I didn’t get drunk every night, but I did have 2-6 drinks on a regular basis and I felt like total dogshit every day and honestly don’t remember much of that year. I’ve always been fit and self-disciplined and I found that that all went out the window very fast when you drink regularly. Since then, I cut it back to only drinking on the weekends. I’ve felt better and I’m in a better life situation overall, but I haven’t lost the 20 lbs that I’ve gained in 2016 and I still have trouble with sleep, anxiety, depression, and all of those other things that pair so awfully with alcoholism. 

I went a straight 30 days sober last November and I found that it was a rewarding experience. But Christmas rolled around and I caved, and since then I haven’t been able to ditch it completely. However, I have found that a few tools work well for me. First as I mentioned, I avoid big parties and get togethers where I know a lot of drinking will take place. My family and friends love to drink and I usually get drunk in these types of situations so I avoid them all together or I’ll make an appearance early in the night and duck out. I also only drink on the weekends. I’m working on cutting that down to only Friday Saturday and not on Sunday. I don’t drink during the work week, even if it’s an occasion where I’ll meet someone out or a celebratory thing. Because my rule is, I don’t drink during the work week (period). 

When I drink, I go out and buy specifically what I want for a night and it’s within a bracket of what I will be satisfied with and what will NOT get me drunk. And it depends on the situation. For example, if I’m meeting with a group of friends for dinner I’ll allow myself ahead of time to have a two beer limit. And I stick to it. If I’m say, having a night in with my spouse and I know we’ll be hanging out watching movies for 5 hours, then I can have 4 drinks during the coarse of the evening. I’ve found when I plan this out ahead of time, I am successful. But here’s the kicker, when I don’t have a plan, like a couple of weeks ago when I was at a family get together and they have endless booze and I have no game plan, well, then I’ve failed. So it’s important to me to have a game plan, a concrete number, the exact supply at hand, and no more than that. 

I’m not saying it’s easy. People on here have said moderation is mental gymnastics. It is. I’m not gona lie. To me though, I would say it has been enjoyable. Moderation is better than getting drunk. Is it better than being sober? Well I don’t know, I’ve never really been 100% sober for longer than a couple of months at a time between 20-30 years old (current age). There have been times when I’ve failed but again, it’s either because my plan sucked or I was in a situation that was more than I could handle. The weird thing is because I have things planned out, My cravings have gone down. I think this is partly because I have not been a daily drinker for over 3 years. This is also because I do not drink impulsively or on a whim. I plan it out ahead of time so if I know I’m having two beers on Friday when I’m meeting friends, I don’t need that Tuesday night beer with a coworker. It’s comparable to when I played sports in college and I’d plan my cheat meals on Saturday so it kept me from eating junk food on the other days. I’m getting better at planning and I’m getting better at dodging parties. I also feel clearer and more in control now that I’m not get hammered or experiencing hangovers nearly as much anymore. 

Maybe I’ll get better as time goes on and I’ll have more to say on here for people that are interested. Or maybe I’ll fall face first and come on here to lick my wounds in your helping hands. To sum it up, moderation is possible (for me, maybe for you, maybe not) but it’s not easy and it does require a lot of work and pre-planning. I hope some of you find this interesting and helpful. Some of you are probably laughing at me, and who knows, you might be right, or not, we’ll see what happens. All I know is that it’s Wednesday and I can confidently say IWNDWYT",2,0

I was a little nervous to meet with her because I decided ahead of time that I would not drink, but I wasn’t sure if that was going to be awkward. In the past, I would meet with her and other colleagues and have wine or beer with dinner. I did not want to seem unsophisticated or insert any of those other negative preconceptions society places on opting out of drinking... 

Thankfully, when it came time to order, I ordered a soda and she ordered a tea. She looked at me and said, “I’m not drinking” and I said, “neither am I” and that was that! I was shocked it would be that easy, like nothing, and we continued on with a lovely conversation about careers, personal goals, and all of those other amazing things that did not involve thoughts or worries about drinking.

231,2019-10-02 01:04:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/dc5p82/hospitalized_with_a_bac_of_048_university/,"Hospitalized with a BAC of 0.48. University required a reflection essay, wanted to share.","I come from a family of heavy drinkers- even as a child, I remember shots being as essential to a get together as background music and horderves. Despite being petite, I inherited an unusually high alcohol tolerance without the tendency to develop negative side effects like hangovers or nausea. The knowledge that this places me at high risk of developing alcohol dependence comes as little surprise given my high number of family members with histories of alcohol related issues. This hereditary factor, along with my size, gender, and ongoing history of eating disordered behavior means I have to practice vigilance while drinking, a responsible practice my naturally impulsive self has neglected in the past.

From chaotic at home violence to urgent hospitalizations, I’ve encountered many “close calls” with regards to my well-being. My religious family makes remarks about the presence of an overworked guardian angle, but statistically I understand that only so many bullets can be dodged before one turns a close call into a tragedy.

After discovering alcohol as a teenager, I quickly recognized its relieving affects, which I admittedly used to block out heavy amounts of insecurities and painful memories. What I did not realize as a high schooler dabbling in substance use was the dangerous situations I would get myself into largely due to alcohol, which would then cause stress I coped with by drinking, and so on. This cycle grew painfully apparent during my freshman year of college, where alcohol played a significant role in multiple events that further damaged my self worth and well-being.

Second semester of freshman year, I grew infatuated with a guy who sat behind me in a class. He was older, attractive, heavily involved in his fraternity, and consequently had numerous connections to other of-age students and parties. Our relationship progressed like a rock skipping on water, fun, light, and almost too quick to keep track of. Everywhere we went he acted as the life of the party, dominating drinking games and navigating rooms full of loud, intoxicated people who all knew his name. I proudly stood at his side as he introduced me to his friends, who would shift their beers from their dominant hands to shake mine. The loud music coupled with romance and a fog of intoxication increased the rock’s speed, skipping faster, faster, faster, before suddenly and unexpectedly shattering the idealized glass-like surface.

This boy’s ability to charm a crowd translated smoothly into settings where we were alone. He had a way of making me feel like the most special, most beautiful person in the world, a high that my young, insecure self allowed to overshadow the less glamorous moments of pressure and force he initiated. Turns out, he made multiple girls feel the same way, before and while we were together, and gained popularity with his fraternity brothers by sharing intimate details of these encounters. After we broke up, his friend told me about the STD he failed to mention, and how he bragged about making me walk home alone in the rain, making a stop to pick up a morning after pill (that due to alcohol) I did not know if I needed with money I didn’t have.

Months later, I heard he had been expelled due to rape allegations. He tried to reconnect with me on social media around the same time- turns out he didn’t even know which girl had reported him.

Shortly after we broke up, I went to a fraternity neither myself or my friends knew much about. After having a few sips of a drink, I lost all memory of the night, waking up the next afternoon with the realization that I had been roofied.

Although the people I surrounded myself with changed sophomore year, my alcohol use and eating disordered behaviors remained, resulting in too many close calls that eventually landed me in the hospital last month where the doctors and nurses repeatedly told my current boyfriend that I really should already be dead.

I’ve always loved Amy Winehouse, not just for her music but also because I resonate with her personality, experiences, and demons. Reading stories about her drunken escapades, toxic relationships, and disordered eating continue to shock me with their resemblances to my own risky encounters and behaviors. Amy died at twenty-seven from alcohol poisoning. Hearing her express herself is like hardwiring a thought translator to my brain. I have her habits, her downfalls, her thoughts, her impulsivities, but I don’t want her end.

Completing the online evaluation basically reinforced what I already knew to be true- the odds are against me. My personality type, genetics, and past outline a textbook definition of a problematic, tragic, substance abusing basket case. The hope, however, lies in the possibility of a life worth fighting for- my loving boyfriend, who sat by my unconscious side all night at the hospital, a fulfilling career in work I’m passionate about, future children who need and deserve a present, stable mother, and the self-worth to know I’m deserving of these wonderful things. I’m done with the “close calls” – I don’t need a guardian angle- I’m an adult with the ability to distance myself from a previously destructive path, etching my own broken road away from drunken, cloudy mistakes and onto the clarity of a life to be proud of.",58,0

My husband suffers from a ton of trauma. Last year his father  committed suicide leading to him into a deep depression and starting therapy.

I have always drank around him but not an alcoholic. But if I drink too much or make any mistake involving alcohol he just labels these actions as alcoholicism. 

Today, I actually went to have an assessment to see if I was in denial about being an alcoholic. But, it was determined my experiences with alcohol might occasionally show abuse but not enough to suggest I need treatment for alcoholism. I do like to go out an party at times. I do not drive. My family life always taught me drinking was fine as long it was responsible.

I am mostly venting but tired of my husband making me feel guilty. He went as far as this past weekend saying I was drinking when he was out of town when I had the kids to his therapist and expressing his concerns with my alcohol use. He created such an issue that she wanted to involve CPS  Very hurtful to allow this to happen so to avoid this. I spend 6 hours today doing the assessment I discussed above to determine I do not have a problem.

Overall, I am tired..I tired of him being highly critical in our relationship about me drinking alcohol. He makes me think all these are wrong. He says all my friends/family have a drinking problem.

I’d chain smoke, and I’d convince myself I was only just relaxing after a long day. This was my only time to myself after all. I deserve to spend my only time to myself how I wanted. 

Instead of heading to my smoking area after bedtime stories and kids are asleep, I change into something I can walk/run in and take a lap or two around my neighborhood. I come home sweaty and feeling proud. I allow myself one smoke before going inside and locking up. I shower and get into bed. 

It’s really hard to not look at my little smoking area and not just sit down for some quiet for an hour or two but I know I’ll want a drink so I don’t. I’m sleeping better, I’m feeling better and even though it’s been a few days (I’m not sure how many) my scale has noticed a difference. 

I’m ashamed to admit this but I also noticed story time for my kids is different. Before I wanted to rush to read the books and get bedtime over with fast. Now I’m not in a rush. I’m taking my time and having more fun with it. 

The longer I’m sober, the more little things I’m noticing that really indicate how much I was wanting that drink at night. How snappy I was vs how I feel now.

Trust, that the bungee jump crew have performed all the safety procedures, and faith that what seems terrifying will actually be enjoyable.  


I can think of no truer analogy for sobriety.   Once I truly made the decision to overcome my addiction, the rest became easy in comparison.  


Yes, there are very difficult challenges to face in early sobriety.  But none were as hard for me as that initial decision to quit.  


The Paper Tigers were faced and instead of fear I found comfort in recovery.   Instead of hating the journey I found satisfaction, peace and even enjoyment in the process.

Just wanted to put it out there, i've got 1 calendar month sober today (or 30 days if you prefer)

I've been drinking pretty heavily since i was 16 on and off, i'm now 36, what used to be a shared bottle of wine in a night turned into at least 2 bottles of wine + beer or spirits, and that was a typical weekday night in, god knows how much i drank on a night out! Also just to clarify my way of picking wines and beers was to go by alcohol % 

I didn't quite hit rock bottom but i was pretty close, had a massive argument with my wife after a night of drinking, a very very messy night, theres a good portion of it that i blacked out for, i've seen the texts i've sent that night and even with autocorrect they weren't legible. After that argument and promising to change/cut down i thought the best course of action was ""hair of the dog"" and i drank all day, ikr, dumb as a bag of rocks.

Later that day my wife said i still smelled of booze so i told her that i had been drinking (i wasn't exactly hiding it, but i wasn't upfront about it either) cue screaming match number 2.

Now i have known i've had a problem for a while, but i've gone a few months without drinking before so thought it wasn't too bad, but now faced with the possibility of the breakdown of my marriage and inevitably losing my kids something clicked into place in my brain and i decided ""no more""

We talked it out, and are working on it, the last time i tried we got a couple of months in and thought ""Hey a couple of glasses of wine/a gin and tonic or 2 won't hurt, i've totally got a handle on it now, can't be an alcoholic if i've stopped this long without any ill effects right?"" both of us agree to some of the blame there, i folded and she enabled.

Lessons learned, 1 drink is too many and 2 is not enough, i've stopped completely now and have no desire to drink again, the price for me is just too high. I will second any recommendation for ""This Naked Mind"" btw, makes good sense.
