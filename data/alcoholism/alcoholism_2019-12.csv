I quit cold turkey in August of 2018 after 12 years of daily drinking. Withdrawal and DTs were fucking hell. I stayed sober until this October when I started drink about 6 - 16oz beers a day again. I had a week off in late November but outside of that I've mostly just increased to a 12 pack a day at this point. The $70+ a week is killing my bank account not to mention my overall motivation for life is almost nothing. I've got to quit again and I know I can. I'm hella scared about going through those withdrawals again.

After a 3 month bender of about a 12 pack a day should I expect to go through withdrawal again if I quit CT? I can probably taper if I have to but I'd rather just go CT.",3

Today I feel out of it. Maybe due to little sleep, but I'm wondering if the amount of time I've been drinking every day and the amount I've been drinking is enough to experience withdrawals.

It’s a long walk in the woods, or in the snow, or just rolling in the grass.

I cry a lot. I’m crying right now. She’s my closest family and she’ll be leaving soon. I’m not ready.

I missed appreciating my dad as cancer took him at 65. Bourbon didn’t help me through the pain, it stole it from me. Booze twisted it; shaped and sharpened the hurt so that now, every time I remember, it cuts. 

I’m feeling it this time. Losing her. Sober. God how it hurts. It... it empties me. This time it’s *my* choice. Mine to feel and mine to remember. Mine to shape as I please. I’ll give nothing more to alcohol; not even my pain. Especially not my pain. 

Puppers, I’m sorry I tugged on your collar that one time.

Dad, I’m sorry I don’t remember that one talk we had.

Multiple DUIs, lost her job, has been kicked out of everyone's house to the point where she's been living in multiple extended stay hotels for the past three years or so. She's been hospitalized somewhere around 10-15 times in the past 10 years, 4 times within the past week. She's been in COUNTLESS inpatient rehab facilities. She was in a psych ward for 5 days once. She always checks herself out early, lies about it, and goes back to how she was living.   

&#x200B;

  


This is literally killing my mom to deal with.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom's friend called my mom the day after Christmas, completely wasted and incoherent, telling her just ""goodbye"" a bunch of times over and over. Not telling her where she was or what she had. After a ridiculous amount of detective work, my mother was able to locate her in her hotel room, unconscious, and brought her to a hospital where they were able to stabilize her. She was on Xanax and vodka (her favorite combination) and the doctor told my mom that if she had gotten here even half an hour later that she'd be dead. My mom packed up all of her stuff from the hotel, including her phone, wallet, ID, credit cards, basically everything she had aside from the clothes on her back, some chapstick, and $30 cash.   


The next day, she checked herself out of the hospital and my mom tried to get her back into the inpatient facility she was at before, but they turned her away, explaining that she needed a medical detox before they could even begin to help her. My mom found a hospital that could do her detox, brought her there, and went home after she was checked in. After that, we found out that this past Monday, her 16 year old daughter (who she ovbiously doesn't have custody of) had to bring her to the hospital for the same reason.   


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We find out the next day that she had checked herself out of the hospital my mom brought her to. We have no idea where she went or how she's getting anywhere. She has no car (obviously), and no money aside from about $30 cash. She doesn't have a phone to call Uber. We found out later that she managed to get herself hospitalized again at a different hospital yesterday.... and that she has since checked herself out again. We have no idea how she even got enough money together to get that messed up again, considering my mom has her credit cards and ripped that room apart from top to bottom and found no more Xanax.     


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This woman is clearly a danger to herself. How do we not have grounds for an involuntary hold for someone who has nearly killed themselves with drugs and alcohol multiple times over the past week? I just have no idea what we can do but I'm scared and I'm angry and, more than anything, I want to protect my mom, who is the only person left in her life that will have anything to do with her.

Lets do this!,"I am 34 years old and I've been drinking since i am 15-16 years old. When I was young, I enjoyed it, and through the years my alcohol consumption rised up exponentially. Especially after my mother died and I got a divorce in the same year which was 2016, and then got a boyfriend whom i was madly in love with and he broke up with me too, and it was just too much. I started self medicating with alcohol. I mean every day, two bottles of wine, or 70cl vodka, or some equal amount of alcoholic drink of my choice. I used to had blackouts when I drank too much before, but recently, I started to not remember my nights anymore. Not a single night. It's so bizarre living like this. I feel like dr. jekyll and ms. hyde. I just have to trust ms hyde to not to fuck up at nights. But I don't have any control on it. And she does fuck up a lot. She is rude, she is embarrassing and she is arrogant. Another very important detail is i am on autism spectrum and my drunk self doesn't seem to be on the spectrum. So i think that's one of the important reasons I liked and started to drink at a very young age and drinking since then. Because Dr. Jekyll is so awkward and embarrassing in social situations and cares. Ms Hyde, just doesn't care.

I also got fat from so much consumption and also I am worried about my liver. So for the last 3 nights, I didn't drink. First night was awful, my brain was making up excuses to go to the store to buy something, and I couldn't slept that night. But I endured. Next day was much better, because I saw that I could do this so I just consumed cups of tea and soft drinks, but not a single drop of alcohol.

Now we are planning a huge party on the New years day with all my friends in our town. I think I will say my goodbyes with the drink at the party and then try a dry-January, as some of you recommended in other posts comments. If I enjoy it i will prolonge the sobriety. And after these three days, I am sure that i will enjoy it.

On another note, I don't live in a country that has functional AA meetings, not in my area anyway. And to add to the injury, everyone is either alcoholic or on the verge because where i live is a beach holiday town. But i believe that i can do this on my own.

I am a dipsomaniac so I think I will channel it to sports. If that becomes an addiction, I will deal with that later haha.

My girlfriend is asleep upstairs and my gf’s brother who’s in town to visit is passed out. Today was a really fun day, but I’ve never felt more comfortable until now. I can drink and do whatever I want, it’s a Saturday night after all, right? This is normal, right? The answer I wish I could just ignore is obviously: no. 

I’ve hid bottles, chugged beers before my gf gets home, drank by myself, drank when nobody else was, it goes on and on and I imagine this sounds very familiar to everyone. My life is actually in a pretty good state, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing wrong. I’m 27, have a loving gf, a nice roof over my head, and an admittedly small but very good group of friends. Doesn’t mean I’m not susceptible to addiction that runs in my family as well as within me. The worst hasn’t happened, but just because it hasn’t doesn’t mean it won’t. 

I’ve been in cycles of denial (using my good things in life as reasons why I don’t have a problem) for the last two years. I’d get sober for a week, then fall off for a month. Reflecting on these constant cycles shows a clear pattern, and I’d really prefer that pattern stops. I don’t want to keep going til things get beyond the point of no return.

I'm really new to the community and I've never posted much of anything on reddit before. However, I feel now it might be necessary to reach out and admit that maybe I have no idea how to carry my life forward...

Bit of background:

I started drinking when I was eleven. Not the odd beer here or there but serious drinking until I passed out (usually in ponds of my own sick). This habit carried on for another 15 years, without the emitted ponds due to a strengthened capacity, but with my enforced constitution came more and more alcohol. I believe I am what is considered a SERIOUS binge drinker, and toward the end of my drinking days I was usually drunk 2-3 weeks out of each month. In those intermittent weeks of sobriety, I'd reconstruct my life to a state that appeared functional and then begin another binge.

I would drink to dull pain, have fun and dull pain. Although, the drinking only compounded those painful issues because for years I was just putting bandaids over cracks in a dam wall. My girlfriend, turned fiance, turned wife is the sole reason I was able to give up booze and recognize the harm it was doing to my life and my health. Well, in February I'll have been dead sober for one year and in March my wife and I will be celebrating our first anniversary. This has been the easiest year of my life and I am extremely proud of my achievements, all of which I could never have done without my wife. 

I never attended AA or other group meetings and got by with the sense of fulfilment which came from sobriety, my wife's encouragement and sheer willpower alone. I recognise that I've had it easy when it comes to this transformation into sobriety. However, I don't believe it's quite enough anymore... 

Current state:

My wife and I have just immigrated to a new country with a rich drinking-culture and I'm finding it nigh impossible to squash my old cravings. I've decided that I would go to AA for some support and guidance, but literally none are available to me in or around my area. These cravings haven't faded for some time and I am worried that I won't be able to fight them off for much longer. If you have any advice which might help me I'd be highly grateful.

Thank you.

But then over the summer as I started going to more parties and events it was sorta impossible to avoid so hey no harm in having a drink or two.

So as the title caption states, I don’t know whether I have a drinking problem or not. I won’t drink whatsoever during the week just because I like to workout in the mornings before work and well, because I have work. Even on Fridays, unless I’m going to a concert/baseball/hockey game, but most of the time I don’t. Although I don’t have work the next day but because I like to go to the gym on Saturdays.

Now, I enjoy going out Saturday nights and strictly Saturday nights. Rare occasion it’s a Friday night and even rarer occasion it’s both Friday and Saturday nights. But when I go out it’s never 1-4. It’s in the upwards of 10+. Aka binge drinking (I think?). I won’t just have 1 drink. I’m either getting drunk or not at all. No in between. I also love going to hockey game tailgates, strictly Saturday games or Friday games. 

Now if my friends would rather stay in and just hangout, I find that boring. They’ll say “just get drinks and we’ll hangout here.” So I’ll go pickup a 12-18 or if I have whisky I’ll bring that and drink until they end up going to bed. Sometimes I’ll stay up later and watch sports recaps and continue to drink until I decide to go to sleep. I’ll wake up (not badly hungover) and just head home and go on with my Sunday “routine” (laundry, get myself ready for work/gym Monday). 

Was curious as to what anyone’s thoughts were on this? Let me know if any clarification is needed with anything I mentioned as I have a hard time explaining my thoughts due to a prior head injury a few years ago.

2019-12-27 16:04:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eggvm9/so_my_first_post_here/,So. My first post here.,"So. My first post here. I dont know whats the point outside of having someone else judge me and tell me yes you have a problem.

Ive known ive been drinking too much from the start. 1,5 years ago? It started when i broke my my arm and didnt go to work for a month. I used to go out to a park every day, drink, read a book. It became a habit and it made me feel more creative, it let me feel things, think life had some meaning.

Here i should mention that this was a few months after i quit doing drugs. And ive had a drug problem for two years before that, mostly weed, benzodiazepines and research chemicals stimulants. I quit when my brother ended up in the hospital bc of the same shit i was taking and bc my parents found out. Point is, ive dabbled enough with addiction and i absolutely know the feeling of chasing the high even it doesnt even feel that good and it drains you physically and emotionally.

At first i didnt see it as a big issue (i only drunk in the afternoon/evening, 2-3 beers or a bottle of wine). But taking a bike out to the park to drink alone bc i knew parents disapproved of me drinking? Sketchy at best, even more so for a 23 yo girl.

I used to do it for the creative streak, the way it made me feel emotions (which was so important as i was coming out of two years of depression and drug abuse and although i was feeling more and more okay i just felt so empty inside). Then a year ago i reconnected with my long-distance best-friend/soulmate/crush that i thought id never talk to again or get over due to a difficult past we had.

I felt like i needed the alcohol to be worthwhile to her, to show enough feelings, to have enough courage, to talk important things. Bc i still felt too empty and boring sober, and shes a very.... intense person, and needs that intensity returned.

Fast forward half a year, she asked me out and became my girlfriend. First relationship in my life, with someone ive been in love with for 4 years, fuck i didnt know what i was doing and i needed that liquid courage. Alcohol actually helped our relationship a lot bc i opened up to her in ways i wouldnt be able to before. Weve had a lot of great concersations and heart-felt moments. She knows addiction first-hand too so she understood and accepted me even if i was an embarrassing drunk mess sometimes.

The situation at home was bad, my parents worried about me and we had many, many fights about my drinking. I understood their point but i also needed that alcohol for social purposes. By this time i started having blackouts and making a mess occassionally so i totally understand my parents' worry, though it wasnt likw that every day.
 
I started hiding - drinking a vodka on my way home, pre-mixing whisky with coke and keeping it in the coke bottle, hiding cans and bottles in drawers and throwing them out only when my parents werent out. I knew this was a bad sign already but mostly i still had everything under control. My mom used to drink 2 beers every night and it was okay so ok i drunk more than that but hey it wasnt affecting my outside life much.

Fast forward, i moved out half a year ago and... The drinkings gotten way way worse now that theres no one stopping me from it and making me feel guilty. At first i thought i have the right to use my freedom for a bit, this is normal. But honestly? Ever since moving out i drink every day. And too much. Too much as in shuffling the four local stores for alcohol is becoming an issue and i worry what do the cashiers think of me. Too much as in i get so sick for the next 24h that work is hell. Ive taken a holiday upon request three times simply bc i was too sick and dead to go.

Its a cycle of get drunk, feel sick for the whole next day, get drunk again. I am fucking up my relationship bc im either too drunk and messy when talking to my girlfriend or too sick to want to talk at all, for days on end sometimes. I think 'ill get drunk and i can fix things with her' but then im just a stupid, tired drunk and i end up going to sleep instead of talking to her.

I think this weeks been my wake up call bc i discovered having another beer in the morning helps the hangover, and bc for the past weeks my afternoon drinking was more about making myself feel less shit and hangover than getting drunk. But i cant do this every day.

I just spent the christmas day so hangover i didnt even hang out with my parents - even though i was spending three days at their place and this should have been family bonding time.

Anyway, this is my story which is probably like any other out there. Its too long i know, im sorry. I just discovered this sub recently and am reading it to hear your stories and find motivation to do better. You guys inspire me. Alcoholism is such a miserable struggle, and the rewards are...truly not worth it. Ive done better drugs and alcohol has too many downsides, its so not worth it and yet its the hardest to curb bc its just so available and popular. Sigh. Anyway, good luck to all of you!! I hope to learn from your exeprience here.",7

But this time I'm worried about my dad. His drinking has gone from pretty bad to completely out of control. My mom has done her best to be patient and supportive, but she's at her rope's end.

He promised to stop. He poured out all his booze and went a week and a half without drinking while they were on vacation. Since then, he's spiralling. He used to reserve his drinking for when my mom was at work (she work overnight shifts), but now he starts drinking as soon as she leaves the house for any reason.  Christmas eve, he got up and left without a word, then came back drunk. Christmas night, my sister asked him not to play with her kids on the stairs because he was drunk, and he told her to get out of she didn't like it, so she grabbed her kids and left with her husband. They didn't even pack up any of their presents, just headed over to my other sister's house to spend the night.

It's been affecting his health, too. He's having heart problems common to long term alcoholics, and we suspect he might get the DTs if he tries to stop cold turkey.

He's going to destroy his life and his marriage, my mom can't take much more. Years ago, she left for a while because he started hitting her. We're worried that's going to happen again. He's turning into his father, whom he hated for being a horrifically abusive drunk, culminating in him (his father) shooting and killing my dad's mom in front of him and his ten siblings.

AA is out of the question, he's too stubborn and prideful. My sisters want me to talk to him, because I understand the struggle, but I don't think he'll listen to the daughter he recently had to bail out of jail for a DUI, and who is currently on probation.

Tldr; my dad is a raging, alcohol-dependent alcoholic, and none of us know how to get through to him.",11

I don't know what to do anymore, I've begged, I've asked, I've bargained, I've threatened her to just stop drinking. Shes had a problem for a couple of years now, she got a DUI, she falls just about every time she drinks and that's about every other night. She hides beer from me, she sneaks around to drink, she lies about her drinking, she tries to guilt me into letting her drink. She says that she can't stop because of all of the 'pain' she suffers through. She says that she doesn't have a problem, and that her drinking is her way of coping. Tonight a friend drives her home from a party and they leave, she apparently fell down our steps and was laying on the ground, our friend came back because she forgot her phone and they saw her passed out on the driveway. After talking to my mom, it seems like she's broken her foot, she said she didn't fall, and that we are lying to her. Shes arguing with me, and yelling at me. Her story of the night keeps changing because she's too drunk to remember anything. 

I can't do this anymore, I just wish she would stop. I think I would give anything for her to stop, for us to be happy. Please God, just make her stop.",1

Appreciate some advice about if I should talk to my friend or not. I honestly think talking to her will destroy our friendship but I don’t know what else to do.

She walks into my house and in less than a minute she has a full glass of wine in her hand. Over a few hours she will have multiple bottles of wine. This in itself wouldn’t be an issue. Even every time I see her (once every week or so). 

But when I text her or talk to her, she always has a drink. And talks about it. Her texts get slurred and non sensical every day after 8.

When we go out anywhere as a group she is always the last hour and never stops drinking. She encourages others to stay at her pace rather than their own. 

She has lost so many friends now. They don’t want to go out with her. I’ve tried to lightly discuss this with her (as have others) but she says things like “I don’t have to prove anything”. 

Her family aren’t much help... they drink a lot too. So she is in that environment at home. But I’m worried by how much she drinks and that no one else will tell her...

Any advice on what I should do? And how I should do it? I don’t want to lose a very close friend.

I was raised by a functioning alcoholic mother. She and my dad gave me and my siblings what they could (we’re a family that has always loved paycheck to paycheck for the most part) and was always the mom volunteering to chaperone for events and be involved in our lives. In truth; however, it was a secret my siblings and I held for years acting as if we had no idea so as to not embarrass her. In person we’d all put on the brave faces and act like everything was fine though behind closed doors, my childhood and teenage years were spent pouring out vodka bottles that were hidden in her drawers. My dad, though not oblivious to this, remained silent because I believe he didn’t want to believe anything was wrong. He saw us as a happy, loving family (which is true, I do love my family though there were very clearly issues). 

About a year and a half ago, my mom turned completely jaundiced, an obvious sign of liver failure. She convinced everyone (my dad included..again he didn’t ever want to believe anything was wrong) that she was using a tanning bed. My sisters and I finally threatened her to go to the doctor or we spill the beans. She agreed and saw her doctor as well as getting blood work done. A few day’s later, while at work, she got a call that she needed to go straight to the ER. At this point, she’s seeing every doctor under the sun and, for the first time, had to openly address her alcoholism with the family. Doctors were telling us that one more sip of alcohol could kill her and that her liver is so damagedthat she may need a transplant. On top of this, her kidneys were barely functioning. 

To note, my family was very reassuring and loving. They were there every morning and night with her. I; however, was livid. I can’t believe a mother would put her family into this situation. I really didn’t speak when in her hospital room. I found myself growing extremely upset too because I was the one learning all of our bank information and learning how to pay bills in case she didn’t make it like doctors were warning. I was the one getting all of the official sh*t together so that our financials and all of that is in order (I’ll add here that my dad is 60something years old and cannot use technology. My mom has always been in charge of the online banking..also how she bought alcohol due to my dad never seeing bank statements). While everyone was mourning together and playing the loving family, I felt lonely and isolated. 

As you can guess from the title of the post, my mom pulled through and doctors were in awe of her recovery. After being relaxed from the hospital, she changed her entire diet and exercise lifestyle and was really in a sense, healthier than I’ve ever seen her (yes her liver was extremely damaged but for the first time she was doing great things for her health and dropped a ton of weight). For the first time in my life, I was feeling a sense of normalcy. Out of my three sisters, the oldest has moved out and loves a few miles away, another goes to school I’m another state so she’s no home year round, and I go to school and live at home. We sort of all got into this routine and no longer felt that our little family had to put on fake smiles, we were all happy and healthy. Christmas Eve (1.5 years later); however, everything changed. Around 6pm I immediately noticed the tone of her voice and mannerisms were eerily similar to how she was when she was drinking. I went to her room and my suspicions were correct, I found an empty bottle of Captain Morgan. My heart sank. I immediately told my sister who started crying (again, I tend to get angry and stoic and push all of my emotions down). We agree that my one sister will go and talk to her privately. She adamantly denied drinking until my sister told her we found the bottle. From what my sister gathered outside the door, my mom was consoling her since she was crying so bad. She also heard that my mom blamed me for her relapse (she claimed I pissed her off so bad earlier in the day that she needed a drink). After hearing that, I went to my bed and sobbed. I’m the reason my mom relapsed, at least that’s how my mom explainer it (though it sounds like this was premeditated since she bough the alcohol a few days prior but man...does it hit you right in the gut to hear your mom blame you). To sum this up, my sisters made me agree to drop it until after the holiday so as to not upset my dad though warmed her that we were doing a search. I didn’t speak to her the rest of the night. The next morning, Christmas, my sister literally texted me to “be happier” when opening presents. Later that day i found a second empty bottle of Captain Morgan in her drawer. As of right now I believe we are going to confront her tomorrow. 

I guess with this post I just have a few questions. Is my reaction to this situation, the first and second time, justified? My sister make me feel bad about feeling this way but I can’t shake this anger I am experiencing. Also, what should be done and how to go about it? I fear that I’m literally staring at her death and by my sisters being nice we’re going to lose her.  Is this what a true relapse is? I hate thinking about it but does that justify and warrant seeking medical help with those two bottles? She did within the last year lose her eldest brother with another brother died before she was hospitalized the first time. Could that be it? Please, everyone, I’m going to look at any and all comments. I just need reassurance and guidance. I truthfully can’t go through this again. I have so much on my plate now and I’m just so tired. I thought things were getting better.",3

I would like to get advice about my state. I’m an athletic male, 30 yo.

95% of the time I’m performing very high. My typical day consists of waking up after ~7.5h of sleep, 20 min of morning exercises, doing a lil bit of home labor, then going to my management work for 8h full of quick and important decisions, next 2h on the gym (weightlifting) every other day, then going back home and doing stuff like cooking, shopping, cleaning etc, and then going back to sleep. I’m busy all the time and feel motivated and energetic. On the weekends I also tend to have a day full of activities - visiting family and friends, visiting museums, I’m rarely able to play on my console. I feel like I never stop and I enjoy this. I feel very self confident and I try to improve myself as much as possible - I’m focused on the target and on the future. I’m also very sociable and outgoing.

There are few things that worry me:

Sometimes a random event that pushes me out of balance happens. Usually these are really trivial encounters like MAYBE running a red light in a car when nobody sees it - despite the fact that even if I got caught and needed to pay the fine, it won’t be much for me. After that I’m overthinking, feeling down, sleepy and nauseous, having no motivation and energy. My sociability and self confidence disappears. It happens even though I objectively know that this event is trivial and I should not be worried about it. Other situations like this are worrying that some important person misunderstood me and took my words as rude - even though I made sure that he or she didn’t, etc. That’s this 5% of overall time of my life. After about one week of feeling down everything goes back to my baseline - performing high and feeling great. This happens one time a few months, something about 3-4 months.

Talking about alcohol - sometimes the day after drinking I immediately feel like I described in the paragraph above and it also lasts about one week. That’s why I’m drinking less and less, but it seems like the amount of alcohol necessary to provoke this state diminishes with every year of my life. For now the amount that will cause this are six 4cl shots or 4 big beers. In my country it counts as “almost not drinking“. I drink only on the social events, maybe one time a month. This also happens one time a few months, something about 3-4 months. I never drink at home and it’s not a problem for me to go to the party and not to drink, but I must admit that when I start drinking it very often goes out of control - I just tend to drink more than I planned even if I won’t blackout nor get really drunk. 

Should I seek for help? The problem is that with months passing I tend to forget how hard drinking consequences may be for me and I decide to have few drinks, but even when I’m controlling myself sometimes alcohol invokes bad feelings day after.",1

My physical symptoms are diminishing. Ive been strong, unmovable in my quit for two days. 

Days 1 and two, the thought of drinking disgusts me, god do i feel awful. Hours pass so slowly its like watching paint dry. Im anxious, paranoid, bored. My muscles ache. But I dont crave alcohol. I WANT to quit. Im determined. 

As day 3 rolls around, i start to feel a better. Much better, infact. The morning is always awesome. 

But at some time mid afternoon, its inevitable. The fight becomes a mental battle.

My mood changes on a dime, i want a drink so bad, im going to do it. No, what am i thinking. But i could have a few, lessen the withdrawal. No, it wont be a few. No, the withdrawal is going away. But i want a buzz, etc. Constant. Constant. 

And I always have given in.

Everytime.

I dont know what kept me away today. It was brutal. Constant.

I gritted my teeth and pushed through. Somehow. 

And you know what? I didnt die. I didnt give in, and now i know im capable of resisting myself, even when every FIBER of myself is SCREAMING at me to drink.

Tomorrow is day 4. One day at a time. Im trying not to think too much about it. That wont help. I just have to do it.

She's found a few organic alternatives but the one thing she can't seem to find is hair conditioner.

So tomorrow I am going to my first AA meeting, I’m nervous but this needs to happen. I am a 26yo man and have identified as an alcoholic for years now, but have never really done anything to change my behaviour - even though I have been routinely hurting others through my drinking and subsequently losing them from my life. The amount of guilt and shame I feel is staggering, sometimes it feels like I can’t breathe. Last night I got wasted and had a huge, violent fight with my cousin. That’s basically my last family connection gone, as my siblings don’t speak to me and my mum is also an alcoholic. I have lost so many friends I can’t count them (no exaggeration), it seems I’ll make friends until they experience me in drink and they run a mile, not that I can blame them. I am not a nice drunk, at all. My ex partner couldn’t take the drinking and left. I even spent some time in prison because of a drunken altercation. The thing is I’m the nicest person when I’m sober, I wouldn’t harm a fly, I care about others and am capable of loving dearly but when drunk it all changes, I’m foul. I’m going tomorrow because even though I have done all these awful, shameful things I still believe deep down that I am capable of being a good person. If we’re judged solely by our actions then I’m scum, I want to be better. I need to be, I can’t do this much longer, I’m starting to feel desperate. Please wish me luck, I need to be better.",59
2019-12-23 03:25:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eehut3/trouble_with_limiting_myself/,Trouble with limiting myself,"I’m a 21 year old woman and I have a complicated relationship with alcohol. 

I don’t feel urges to drink, and I primarily drink socially, besides the occasional beer or glass of wine at the end of a day. I feel like I don’t meet many of the warning signs of alcohol abuse. I used to drink to avoid my problems, but I worked on my relationship with drinking a lot and now I feel like I genuinely choose to drink because I have fun. However, my ratio of blacking out to times drinking is far too high. 

Whenever I get tipsy, all my mind wants is to be more drunk. I feel like I’m incapable of stopping at a buzz. I’ve tried setting a limit on how many drinks I’ll have in a night, but I never follow it because I decide I don’t feel the way I want to. I’m very stubborn, so anything that my friends or significant others say about my drinking is usually met with resistance. I feel like I annoy the people around me when I’m drunk, and it only gets worse when I black out and embarrass myself. I often feel a lot of shame and guilt after blacking out, although I have past trauma with blacking out and alcohol use that I think contributes to this. 

Last night, I went to my boyfriend’s family christmas party. I was drinking wine throughout the night, but slowly, with food, and I wasn’t feeling drunk or even tipsy. Towards the end of the night, I decided I wanted to feel the effects more so I increased my drinking. I probably drank two glasses of wine in the last half hour I was there, and I blacked out. We were about to leave, so I don’t think I embarrassed myself in front of his family, but I don’t remember saying goodbyes or the car ride home (My boyfriend was driving and he was sober). I’m so mad at myself. I thought I was doing really well at keeping myself in check, I always do, and then I think it’s okay to accelerate my drinking and it gets totally out of control. 

Does anyone else have this problem?? I don’t think I drink too often, but when I drink it’s too much. I just don’t know my limits at all and don’t know when to stop. It’s really frustrating and any advice would be appreciated.",8

I continue to have hot flashes and tingling on my skin when I try to lay down to sleep even after the Xanax.  It has been about 28 hours since I have had any alcohol as of this posting.

I’ve realized that after every day of work, I buy a bottle of wine and go home and drink the entire thing. This happens 3-4 times a week, and it’s been happening for the past 5 months or so. I’m on my way home from class or work? Stop by the gas station and buy some wine. It’s not even that I had a super stressful day or anything, my mind just goes “you deserve this” and then I drink the entire thing in one night. Rinse and repeat. 

I don’t drink hard liquor often at all, it’s mostly cheap $5 to $15 bottles of wine. It’s been adding up though, by the end of the week I could spend around $40 on alcohol alone. 

I also have Type 1 Diabetes. Which makes things worse because alcohol affects blood sugar as well, especially sugary drinks. 

It’s frustrating because I know how shitty I’m being to myself by drinking so much but I still do it. Hell, my uncle died of liver failure, my dad used to be an alcoholic. Shouldn’t all of these things deter me??? Why the hell am I drinking so much?? 

What’s worse is that it doesn’t even feel like I have a problem. I don’t get black out drunk, only buzzed. I don’t get hangovers. I only drink enough to get buzzed at home, and if I drink at a restaurant I limit myself to one beer. BUT, I’ve been drinking whole bottles of wine every week. My mind says “it’s just wine, it’s not like you’re downing bottles of whiskey” but it doesn’t matter, I’m still drinking a lot of alcohol in single sittings, several times a week. 

I’m sorry for the weird rant. It’s 11PM at night, I got off work at 9PM and ever since I got home I’ve just been sipping away at my goddamn wine. I don’t want to be like this, I really don’t.

If you dont want to read it i get it cause it has quite a lot of backstory.
 Ive had a drinking problem for a while now. Not as much bingdrinking, as more drinking when im alone in the evening or very tipsy througout the entire day. 

Now i know that this isn't healthy behaviour and ive spoken with my therapist about it. In fact, ive actually had my last appointment! (mayor ex-depression victory, but leaves me kind of scared tbh). Sometimes, i still drink. Mainly in the evening, sometimes in the morning. I'm also 18 and for this year still live with my parents.
Yesterday evening my dad walked in and asked if id been drinking. I guess the smell aas still in the air. I answerd semi-honestly and told him i had a few beers. Honestly it had been more than that and im not proud of it. He wasnt happy with that, mainly because id been alone in my room that evening.
He hasnt spoken to me all day. 
He told me that he's ready to talk to me about it tomorrow, but i'm not sure if i am. He doesnt know about my drinking history, only my therapist does. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to say to him?",8

Last week I stepped into my first A.A meeting . I think that was the best choice I have made for myself in years. A room I once thought of as intimating, was actually very welcoming. I, like many others, had this idea of what A.A was. When I thought of it, I pictured a room of older people crying into coffee cups in some dingy church basement. It was not that at all. For the first time, I was hearing stories from other people that I could really relate to. The difference was, these people made a change, became the change and while they still held struggles - they were happier, lighter, more connected. I want what this group of people have. I didn't have any sober friends last week, this week I have over ten. This week I have more hope than ever before that maybe I actually can do this. This week I am not hungover. This week, I have cried almost every day - some what from the emotions withdrawal brings on, but mostly crying from relief. Relief that I don't have to be a prisoner of my addiction if I work not to be. 

I am grateful to have found my hope this week.",65

I’m desperate.,"Hello to all who read this. I desperately need help. I posting this for advice and insight. I am hoping and praying someone out there is willing to help. I’ll try to keep this short. 

I’m not an alcoholic. My now ex boyfriend is. We were together for five years, and broke up on Monday 12/16/19.  We have lived together with my 8 year old son for 2.5 years. Things have been bad between us for over a year, in many ways... from the minor
daily items to major things we have had to have together, we always end up in the same arguments. The physical aspect of our relationship has been non-existent in every way. Whether in the bedroom or sitting next to each other on the couch, there has been nothing for over a year. 

We had a bump on the road with his sobriety, a year ago October. Based my on previous experience with my son’s father’s alcoholism and drug addiction I had to draw a hard line about what I cannot have in my life because I don’t want to put my son through the heartache that comes with this family disease. I also don’t have the strength to go through all of that again. 

Fast forward to Monday night. We had our 5th couples counseling therapy session. I saw some red flags during the appointment but I think I was subconsciously in denial... I know now that he was first drinking at the house with my son and two neighbor kids there- again, this was part of the hard line he shouldn’t have crossed. He showed up therapy and was under the influence... I didn’t see it then, but I do now. Later that night I found him  in our basement, extremely drunk, passed out and when I was able to rouse him he was incoherent. To me, this is the ultimate betrayal. I reacted in kind, out of pain, total rage and selfishness. I screamed at him, told him I’m leaving him, and I called him names. I said a lot of things I shouldn’t have, and didn’t mean. I don’t know if he even remembers that. Given his state, I am not surprised if he doesn’t. We haven’t spoken since Tues. 12/17, and in short he told me he has been drinking for doesn’t think we should be together. I agreed, although I still love him immeasurably. 

He wants to get together tomorrow 12/23 to talk. He said he thinks it will be good for us to do so. I want to as well, mainly because I love and miss him desperately and I don’t truly want this to end, in spite of all that we have been through. I don’t know what he wants to gain out of talking. I don’t know if it’s just the logistics, a transactional discussion about how to navigate this separation, or if he wants reconciliation, to apologize, or what. 

I agreed to meet. I thought I was ready to talk. Thinking about it more, I just don’t think I am. I’m still in so much pain. My heart is so broken for my son, my ex was like a father to him. My heart is broken for my ex,  I didn’t know the depth of his suffering at all. I knew he was depressed. I tried to get him to talk about it, or about us or how I could help...and he didn’t disclose to me anything that he was going through in his own heart and mind, and how it was affecting him. I know I can’t go there, see his face and his big blue eyes, feel the love and heartache I am experiencing, along with acknowledging his and keep myself from crying. I know I won’t be able to ask him why he did this, why he lied for so long and didn’t feel he could turn to me. I know he likely felt ashamed. I have begged him for at least a year to end it if he felt that’s what was needed. He swore he loved me and wanted this to work. I just don’t think that is true now, and I don’t believe that he has loved me for a long time... or even if he ever did. 

I guess I would like to know if you think I should still meet with him, in spite of everything. I don’t know if I should just go and let him speak his mind, whatever that means. If you think I should, what do I say? What do I ask? How can I keep from crying, from exposing how hurt, pained, heartbroken and betrayed I feel? Am I selfish for wanting to know answers, or what my role has been in all of this? 

Please help me. I need all of the advice I can get. Tell me the good, the bad, the ugly. Please.",3

Except my father. 

For backstory, he lvied in Kentucky owning a succesfull construction business. He had a wife that, well, ill just say everyone in the family viewed as attractive, and had several kids. He pissed all of that, and all (literally all, they had to take their kids out of public schools and sell almost all of their physical possesions) of his money on booze and was kicked out. My father immediantly let him stay with him and got a new car (he has significant disposable income) and gave him his old one. 

We thought he was doing better (weeks with no major problem), but on 3PM on a saturday on his way to the airport to go back to Kentucky to see his kids for christmas, he gets so drunk that he goes 20 over the limit and never even attempts to brake, crashing into an empty car carrier (dont know proper name). if he was not driving a truck, he would be dead(-cop). Somehow he is unharmed.

Dad is going to the courthouse tomorrow, and despite his ex-wife (my mom), and sister's complaints everyone knows he will bail him out immediantly, pay any bills that he would have to pay himself (he has a job but is still broke) and get back on his feet with no repurcussions other then maybe an unpleasant phonecall with his children and ex-wife

This is a manipulative man used to lying. He once did the drink-all-the-vodka-then-replace-with-water trick, without even telling my dad (the vodka was expensive and a gift for a friend, who called my dad, embarrassing  him greatly). My dad is an alcoholic himself, though he used to be a far worse one, now he is more of just an alcohol enthusiast ill say, and more of a sad drunk then a crash-and-total-car-ruining-his-life drunk, so maybe he sees himself in his brother or something. My dad picked himself up from the bootstraps and now runs a succesfull business, while the uncle is (apparantly) still struggling greatly with no real desire to help himself, since he has the safety net of my father he knows will soften his fall without fail.

This is a man whose hit rock bottom and recovered, and is somehow thought it was a good idea to gun his way back to the bottom. He's been to rehab. Dad is just enabling him. What can i do or say that eveyrone else hasnt to convince him that hes not helping my uncle by 'helping' him?",2

He's absent but yet right here. We were supposed to do the whole flea market thing this morning. It's nearly one o clock and he is still ""sleeping it off"". He quit his job this past Monday.

I'm not sure how to approach this and I need advice.,"Last night my wife had an end-of-the-year drinking party for work, came home around 2 AM, puked her guts out all day, and stayed in bed until 5 PM. This is what's prompting me to reach out for help.

&#x200B;

Some background information that's very relevant: we live in Japan. There is a certain workplace drinking culture here that makes it difficult to refuse alcohol. If you want any hope of promotion, you can never refuse an invitation to go out drinking after work. Here, you don't pour your own drink. Someone else pours it for you and it's considered rude not only to *not* refill someone's empty glass, but also not to drink what has been poured for you. This results in everyone drinking way too much.

&#x200B;

My wife loves her job and one of her life goals is to rise in her field and her workplace and, so far, she's been very successful. She attributes this a lot to attending drinking parties with her superiors and I don't think she is wrong to believe that. 

&#x200B;

It is also considered ""normal"" in this culture to have 1 beer after work...daily. 

&#x200B;

The culture is the way it is, but my wife's drinking has been becoming worse and worse as of late and I'm afraid it's going to keep getting worse unless I help her. A few years ago, she would rarely drink except for work parties. But as of last year, she began drinking more and home. Usually only one cocktail, but it is enough to get her drunk. She has a very low tolerance. 

Now, she drinks almost every night and drinks *too much* at work drinking parties. Too often she comes home at 2 AM, passes out and pukes all day the next day. (Sometimes she'll even get home at 2 AM, drunk, and she has to get up at 6:30 the next morning to get the 7:30 train to work. She always manages to do it, but just barely.) When she is hungover, she asks me to buy her sports drinks or make her food etc, which I have always done in the past. 

&#x200B;

Today, I put my foot down and told her this was her own fault and she had to take responsibility. I refused to coddle her while she suffered from her hangover. I also had work to do and couldn't be bothered, plus I'm battling a cold.

&#x200B;

On that point, her drinking is affecting my work. When she has been hungover, I have taken care of her and sacrificed my work time (I work mostly at home). When she gets home at 2 AM, she is loud and wakes me up. Once, I missed a very important work event because she turned off MY phone and MY alarm clock because she had a headache and wanted to sleep more. (She apologized later...when she remembered she had done it.) When she is drunk at night after work she comes into my workspace and bothers me and I can't concentrate on my work. 

&#x200B;

Every time she drinks too much she swears she'll stop drinking or not drink ""for a while"", which usually lasts three days or so. Then the cycle begins again.

&#x200B;

This year, she also made a huge 12 L (or so) jug of plum liquor she plans to drink. Things are getting out of hand fast.

&#x200B;

So far, I have told her I won't help her when she is hungover anymore - she is on her own. I have also nearly completely stopped drinking (except for special events like birthdays / Christmas) as a way to encourage her to stop as well. I have told her I think she has a problem and she laughed and just said ""I told you, I'll stop this time. Until the end of the year"". I told her this was serious, but she wasn't taking it seriously.

&#x200B;

I sat with her and explained this calmly to her and said I needed her to listen carefully. She said she was because I was explaining it calmly to her, so she knew I was serious now. So far, I got her to agree that she won't drink except on Christmas (we already ordered a bottle of champagne). She wanted to drink on New Year's Eve, but I talked her out of it. We agreed that if she breaks her promise, I get to throw out the 12 L of plum liquor she made.

&#x200B;

I don't know what else to do. We live in a somewhat rural area of Japan and there isn't too much support here. Even if there were some support group nearby, she would simply say she has no time to go as she already works 12+ hour days and has irregular days off. She won't refuse drinking parties because they are essential for her to become successful in her field and achieve her life goals. I can't attend them so I don't know how to convince her to drink less when she goes.

&#x200B;

What should I do? What should I say to her to motivate her to drink less? (And especially to stop drinking at home). And maybe more importantly, what \*shouldn't\* I say / do? Is telling her ""you're on your own if you get hungover"" the right thing? Or should I be more supportive? (Or is that enabling?) When she drinks too much, should I be emotionally supportive and encouraging (enabling?) ? Or should I be harsher (counterproductive?) ?

&#x200B;

I honestly didn't expect I'd ever be faced with this problem and I'm at a loss at how to deal with this, especially given the culture here and that she doesn't seem to think it's such a problem. 

&#x200B;

Any advice or insight you can give me would be really appreciated.",1

A large part of that is thanks to the kind words and recommendations you all gave me just about one month ago, I love all of you for that :)

Here's my original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e107j8/my_sobriety_begins_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Since giving up alcohol, I feel like I've unlocked a new portion of my brain that doesn't procrastinate and gives me so much more motivation to hit the ground running with ideas I've always wanted to make a reality.  I've had a longtime interest in web development and have always wanted to learn it but my brain always USED TO say ""where do we even start?  That seems like a lot of work, let's just save that for tomorrow and drink and play video games instead.""  My other passion has always been with skateboarding, although I hadn't skated in a longtime, I continued to follow the pros and live vicariously through them on Youtube.

After all of your guys recommendations and kind words, such as find/rediscover a passion to pass the time, journal the journey, and have a network of people with the same issues, it finally dawned on me.  I wanted to combine all of these things into a single platform, so long story short after many many hours (although I feel like the days are so much longer when I'm not drinking) I've finally launched my very own website:

 [https://soberskater.com/](https://soberskater.com/) 

Without going into too much detail it is basically a website that contains a blog (my journal), a forum (community of like-minded people), created through a passion for my passion.  The main goal is for people to achieve self betterment through skateboarding.

Although many of you could probably care less about skateboarding, I just wanted to stop by and express my gratitude to all of you for helping me when I was nervous right out of the gate.  Hopefully this can also inspire some people to dive head-in to their passions and create something they've always wanted to as well.  You are all such caring and intelligent people.  I sincerely hope we all have a great holiday season spent with the people dearest to us instead of the bottle.

Cheers!

A couple years ago I needed to resign from my job due to my mental health and alcoholism. I became very ill and even was jaundice for 45 days. My liver was severely inflamed and I had alcoholic hepatitis. I also had ulcers, gained weight, and had several self-inflicted injuries from alcohol related accidents. I was up to at least a liter of vodka a day. I didn’t like it, I was in pain, I was miserable, and I wanted to die.  I could not see a way to get out of my predicament. The biggest problem I faced was most people had no idea what I was dealing with until I became jaundice. People could not believe I was drinking as heavily as I was and able to function the way I was functioning.  I was going to work, getting promoted, and making good money. I’m married and I’m a Dad. I dress decently and I’m polite. I’m clean cut and usually appear well put together by my peers. People normally say “He’s a funny guy”. For 2 years I struggled with putting down the drink. I went to AA and accepted help whenever and wherever I could.   Thankfully, I met a lot of great people in recovery and AA is truly a great tool. It’s not for everyone but it’s helped me and it’s free (or $1 donation if you want). I’m not religious so that area in AA is still a little daunting but I work the program as it works for me. I had several relapses but finally with the help of Vivitrol and a change in my MDD medication, I’m finally doing better. Getting this job and making real money again was a huge accomplishment. I also have another child on the way which I’m very excited for. Here’s to 20 months! I didn’t think I’d be alive right now let alone still married with another kid on the way. I’m thankful my wife stuck by my side and helped me. It wasn’t easy for anyone but I’m truly thankful for another chance. If you’re struggling right now, THERE IS HOPE. YOU CAN DO THIS!",12

r/DecidingToBeBetter

r/alcoholism

&#x200B;

Recently I have been just trying to be better, live my life and not letting the actions of others bother me.  

&#x200B;

I have been visiting my local pub pretty regularly for a few years now.    I would go and have something to eat, and a few beers.   The last several years that picked up alot.   And has settled into 2-3 times a week, either a Saturday or Sunday during the day and 1 or 2 evenings.   Recently the trend has been several hours to an entire afternoon and moved into the 4-6 pints of beer range.  This is too much.   Sadly, this is almost all my social interaction and I need some of that!!

&#x200B;

That being said, the times i don't go, I don't drink at all, but when I'm home i just want to go.   I don't drink at home.   I live by myself and have a cat.   That and work are pretty much my life.   

&#x200B;

So i don't think I would ""fit"" the label of an alcoholic, but it's too much, it's not really helping me and honestly, i want more out of life.   I am pretty torn up with all this, but one thing seems to ring true.   Alcohol brings nothing good to you.  And saying that last night when the urge after was strong seemed to get me over the hump, I made some dinner and stayed home.   

&#x200B;

As I looks towards 2020 I have all ready started my ""resolutions""

&#x200B;

To stop, or virtually eliminate all drinking alcohol.  

&#x200B;

To improve my health and lose the weight that keeps appearing.

&#x200B;

To start riding my bicycle again.

&#x200B;

To not let the actions of others drive my decisions.

&#x200B;

To find a new job.

&#x200B;

There's a lot here... stopping alcohol should help with the weight though,  and I've been applying for jobs for a bit now.  I should not expect this an on/off switch and just start doing all this, that is a recipe for disaster.",6

Last week we went on vacation to the Caribbean. We rented a house through VRBO on the beach. It was my wife and I, my wife’s parents and her brother with his girlfriend. Wife’s brother is mid 30’s and is the subject of this post. I’ll try to paint a good picture for you. 

Our flight left our home city at 6:00am. Therefore, we needed to be at the airport by 4:45 at the latest. He shows up and smells strongly of alcohol. He says he’s already a little drunk and that they’ve (his girlfriend and him) have been drinking since the second they woke up. I chalked this up to them being excited for vacation and although 4:45am is pretty early to be drinking, whatever we’re going on vacation. 

On the flight to our destination they proceed to drink nonstop. They tried to bring ~20 of the little bottles of booze with them, but the TSA would only let them take 2 each. This was the first of a long week of him having what appeared to be uncontrollable anger “fits.”

So, they drink the whole flight. Again, I figure he’s just excited for vacation. We get to our destination and we need to wait about an hour to board our next flight which is just a little puddle jumper flight of about 20 mins. In the hour wait I watched him drink four draft beers. 

The rest of the week he and to a lesser extent his girlfriend drank like nobody I’ve ever seen. Each day at one point they were fall down drunk. By the third day he was so sick he laid in bed all day with nausea and diarrhea. However, by around 4pm he began to feel better and almost the second he felt better her was slamming drinks again. I noticed that every day when he rolled out of bed he would pour a huge glass of booze and a mixer before brushing his teeth. I’m talking 8am when the rest of us are drinking coffee (and some not even awake) he would be pounding a glass full of booze. I’m talking 3-4 shots worth of rum and maybe a half cup of orange juice. By the end of the week it was obvious he wasn’t drinking in the morning because he was on vacation, he was drinking because it had been seven or eight hours and he NEEDED to drink. 

Again, the whole week was like this. I’m 40 years old and did my fair share of partying in college but I’ve never seen a human being drink so much before. When vacation was over we flew back to the states and he drank the whole way back too. Most people would recognize that vacation is over, but he seemed to be pounding drinks for all it was worth. Think of the Wade Boggs episode of Its Always Sunny. Except remove all the funny parts. 

At our final airport he is now angry and belligerent. He’s yelling at people in the corridors and is making a scene every time we stop. I don’t know how security didn’t throw him out or have him arrested. 

We reach our hotel since we have an eight hour layover between flights. While the rest of us are checking in, he comes in with his luggage and practically runs to the hotel bar. Doesn’t even bother checking in, just runs straight to the bar and starts pounding drinks. 

I brought it up once or twice with my wife and her family. She agrees wholeheartedly with me, but her family doesn’t seem to think it’s a problem. My wife would casually say something and her parents would stand there with blank faces or would change the subject. We all see her brother maybe once a month so at least for us, we had no idea this was happening and we can’t prove that it wasn’t just a vacation “fluke” and that he’s not perfectly fine at home on his own. Myself, I’m convinced by his behavior on vacation that he’s likely got an alcohol problem, and there is a good chance he’s got a MAJOR problem. What are your thoughts?",1

I break down a couple points to make it short and effective as I'm not using it as an excuse or an apology, but I'm curious how others explain this to a spouse/parents/sibling.

1.While drinking is a choice at times, it is also not a choice at others.  This can be argued for hours but the fact remains that I've seen spoken to people who ""choose"" alcohol over their spouse, children, career, family and their own life.  I have attempted suicide twice out of the helpless feeling that even if I managed to stay sober for a time, relapse can always occur and I'm not ready to work through another round of withdrawals and shame.  The thought that one would choose death over any action differentiates it against other types of choices and should not be compared in that way.

2. There is no effective way to explain addiction without addressing the fact a choice is not being made by the addict to continue using.  The disease model/explanation does a decent job to explain this as I would not blame someone for being ill regardless if they took action which precipitated the illness.  I simply would not if it  is a person I care for.  The addicts actions to use are a symptom of addiction and also feed the disease.

3.There cannot be addiction without lying because there is no acceptable form of addiction.  A typical relationship cannot form if the truth is known that the addict is using in the way an addict does.  We will do anything to continue using which includes lying to those around us.  

4.When an addict is not using, the lies continue in the form of what our loved ones are hoping to hear and what we hope to believe ourselves.  I've been doing fine, the cravings are manageable, I think I'm over the hump, I've been cured...etc.  I try to be truthful today but if I was, I would use statements like ""I'm still an addict, always will be, and will always be one drink away from ruining everything I have worked to achieve including my own life and the sanity of those who love me."" All of those things are true, but are not helpful to my working towards getting better and believing I have a life ahead of me.  I cannot say those things to a prospective employer for instance or a new acquaintance and expect a traditional relationship to form.

Out of everyone, only a couple close to me really understand these things while the rest smile and oddly enough, lie to me about how they feel.  Meetings and steps are useful tools but it is unhelpful to be completely honest and still be uplifting to those around you in a setting where so many people are struggling.  I suppose there is always Reddit...",4

She’s the kind of person who just adds whoever on FB and often has guys ogling over her pictures. I think insecure me told one of them off when I was blackout. Regret.

I went crazy when I saw she had a new boyfriend and said if he cheats on her he won’t look so pretty anymore. It was the one thing I promised myself I wouldn’t say, but I was so drunk I couldn’t help myself. She absolutely hates me now.

My question is I don’t drink but when I do drink the very last time I got suicidal and it was horrible. Every time I drink I forget what happens I usually black out, I always end up drinking to much.

Should I stop before it becomes a problem?,"I have been lurking here for months wondering if I have a drinking problem and would be very grateful to hear your thoughts.

I am nervous to even ask here and do so with respect. I understand many people here are fighting a harder battle than me and are sometimes re-building their lives from rock bottom.

I'm not at rock bottom at all but I am starting to recognise that the addictive nature of alcohol is having more and more power over me. It's tricky because I don't drink every day, and when I do I don't get into any trouble. I can drink a load and am not really a sloppy drunk. Usually, I get quite jolly, a little verbose, then a little sleepy.

But when I do drink (1-2 times a week) lately I have been noticing I can't just stop at a few. I adore the feeling of being tipsy. So I might finish 2 bottles of wine, smoke a load of cigarettes, eat some crappy food and stay up way too late. I am starting to see I am drinking much more than those around me, whether in professional or social situations or by myself at home. I am finding myself ordering 2 drinks at the bar and covertly knocking back the first quickly to then join others with my second drink. I have been filling up a drink bottle with vodka and soda for an evening walk with my dog.

Then due to my ongoing chronic illness, the next day I can barely move from exhaustion. And then the depression kicks in. I've missed countless days at work plus too many fun weekend days because I 'accidentally' got too drunk the night before.

What scares me is that I am watching my behaviour, and I am fully convinced I need to moderate my drinking but seem to be unable to. I am in the electronic dance scene and have been dabbling with recreational drugs on the odd occasion for more than 20 years. I have never had an issue with moderation, excess or addiction before.

Surely if I am worried that I have a problem, then I have a problem. I've never vocalised this to anyone before, hoping this is a good first step.",12

I had ""quit"" for a few weeks and decided to give up dipping. was dipping nearly two cans of redseal fine cut (which has about 1/4th a can more dip in it than other dips). Ive heard a can of dip has quite a bit more nic in it than a pack of cigs. Id been dipping like 7-8 years. Needless to say I was VERY addicted to nicotine and the withdrawals were brutal at that amount.

cut back on that a lil at a time and switched to cigs once i was able to (weird strategy to most im sure but i tried everything and this worked as i dont like smoking).

Now im smoking like a black and mild a day. I dont inhale every puff. So prob inhaling half a black a day. 

Anyway, Im at the point that i can quit nicotine without feeling COMPLETELY terrible... but during the quit i picked up drinking again.

Im about a month into daily drinking so i know ill have withdrawal. Im having mild withdrawals currently (day 3 of cutting back, had 6 light beers today vs the liter of whiskey if been drinking daily for a month).

Anyway, after i quit drinking and the withdrawals subside im going to kick the nicotine too!


Its been a long fight and due to my inability to cold turkey ive been having some form of light withdrawal for like a month and a half. 

I know im at the point now where i have to stop drinking. I am determined. Its also the only way i finally kick the nicotine also.

He trys to ""take breaks"" and not drink for a few days then drink then break and so on. His breaks are now one or two days sober with most days drinking. He also recently lost his mother to alcoholism which has prompted him to want to quit but also made him drink more. 

We also have a planned date night every friday night which involves drinking. I only drink on fridays. I think this may be hurting instead of helping but his argument is that it helps give him motivation to not drink during the week. But he still drinks during the week.

He has also had many doctors visits and complains of pain everyday. He says his pain is in his groin. We're not totally sure its alcohol related but he has ruled out a lot of conditions. He has IBS and is currently trying to get a colonoscopy covered by insurance. 

I also have discussed with him many times about my opinion and what I would like to see him do. Which is to quit completely.

Can this really work or does he just need to quit cold turkey?

What can I do? Am I hurting him?

2019-12-15 12:09:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/eb1ggv/last_call_for_alcohol/,Last Call For Alcohol,"Somewhere... in between the black-outs, the white-outs, we inebriates make our way out the exit-doors, usually head first, or by the seat of our pants... on a good night.    

The 'last call for alcohol' at Kodiak Ron's sent shock-waves throughout my body... sirens wailed in my mind every time I heard it, magical pump and dump, “I gotta get another half-rack of 'sixteen-pounders' before the clock hits two am,” I slam down what's left in the bottle, gear-up for another 'after-hour party.'   

Slip' my way through all the beautiful bouquet' of booze... wilting with the night, in faded light, finding my way out the door.  

It had gotten foggy and cold since I started drinking that early after-noon.  The parking-lot was huge, I couldn't see beyond fifty feet of my face.  I negotiated my way back, to my Jet-black '49 Chevy Pickup, jumped in, lit a smoke, pulled the choke, pumped the gas a few times, hit the ignition and she fires right up... the smell of raw fuel dumping out my exhaust right behind the cab wakes me up some.  

The motor starts lopping hard warming up, I feather the throttle, push the choke back in a bit, oil pressure rises to 60 psi, temp finally hits 180 and she starts to lean-out. I set the E brake, get out, check that the turning signals, running lights... light on my license plate, and headlights. A good once over.  

Mobile drunk mantra of the  “habitual traffic offender” driving under the influence, without a license, for driving under the influence... without a license, before he launches, unleashes himself onto the highways and byways.

The '49 was punchy, I build the little 265 Corvette Rat Motor... that came with it when I started the project, it wound out piss tight and shook the truck well. It would only top-out about 110 mph., but it did it like yesterday. Very quick, squirly and I love to play in it.  

People were still cruising on Evergreen Way, I jumped on the throttle hard showing off, got sideways blowing the carbon out of mi semi-fouled plugs and looked for the Blue Light Special behind me.  I cruised a short bit looking for the after hour party but the clock was ticking. I  pulled into the gas pumps at 7-11 and made a bee-line to the booze isle... with a herd of other colorful intoxicated sheep doing the same, trying to beat the clock.  There was this older women sitting on the curb crying out-loud not far from the entrance of the store, she sat with two big garbage bags of empty aluminum cans she'd gathered up in the day.  She caught my eye, I watched her ask several people for a ride while waiting in line, nobody cared enough to help. All the cars were clearing out of the parking lot, and there she sat, crying, confused. She was most certainly mentally ill. She dressed like a bag lady and a mess.

I walked past her with half-rack in hand... think' 'shit, she is desolate, its freaking cold out, after two am now.' I sat my half-rack behind the driver-side cab, pulled up the gas lever and pumped some petrol in my machine, all the while thinking about her disposition. I got into my truck and wuz gunna fire it up, but I felt compassion for her, and my heart wouldn't leave me alone about it.  I got back out of my truck and walked over to her, sat down on the curb with her and began to make conversation.   

I asked her what happened, why are you stuck here, she explained she missed her bus, it was the last one to Stanwood. I said why didn't you call a cab, she said she didn't have any money, and went on and on and on. I offered her a ride home... She was timid, but she agreed, she was desperate I'm sure, she just needed to get home.  She said she lived with her mother and that it was just as you get into Stanwood, I said that's not to far, I can do that for you.  She stepped on the running-board, pulled herself up and in, sat down neurotic like, got herself buckled up... and Off we went.

Mind you, its early morning, foggy as my memory and I'm a wee bit intoxicated. She seemed nervous as hell so I drove mellow... it became apparent to me after driving in circles for an hour she was confused and not sure where she was... I'm thinking 'just pick a spot and I'll drop you off there, I got you this far and I'm ready to pass-out.'  We went down another road and she found her driveway. I thought ""thank God!"" She thanked me over and over and I felt good about it, I got her home.

At this point, I have no idea where I'm at, its so foggy I can hardly see, but I pick a road randomly with intuition and hoped it would take me in the direction of I-5... but it didn't.  I did take me to a Fire Station 'tho, and I said 'screw this, I'm crashing here.'  

I came-too freezing my ass off a few hours later, sick, windows fogged over, I could hear cars driving by... I pulled myself up by the steering wheel, looked into the mirror, saw a blurry face with bloodshot eyes and thought 'fuck... where the hell am I at now. I need a drink...' got out of the truck, pissed, lit up a smoke, pulled out a few beers from the box, what was left and threw it into the cab.  I pounded down a couple... that pounded back up, covered my mouth, pounded it back down, while the truck was warming up, trying to get my bearings strait, waiting in angst to feel the booze kick in. I lit another smoke, wondered if the firemen wondered why I was parked in front of their firehouse.  

Back on the road...  followed traffic till I could figure out where I was.  By the time I made it to I-5 I was needing another drink... but I knew I had to eat, I hadn't eaten anything 'nutritious  for a couple of day's... but, I couldn't eat until I had a few more beers in me.  I pulled into McDonald's and ordered up a sausage Mcmuffin with egg meal... I must of looked like shit and stunk like stale booze and cig-smoke by the look on the gals face; like 'damn brother... you stink and look a mess.'  Cometh now the Four Horsemen.

By the time I made it back home... I was starting to feel better, the booze was doing its job.  I thought about why didn't I just go to an after hour party instead of going through all that bullshit...  I don't know... perhaps I felt compassion, even when drunk, and I was moved to do something about it, that's how it is with me, I don't do anything easy... my heart seems to dictate where I should go at times, some call that conviction, I call it a pain in my ass. I think alcoholics inherently have a weakness for the weak, we tend to mix with them esp. when in our cups.  

We love to commiserate our pain. I have found myself in many a sorted place, many a time, after a night out with John Barley Corn. I must have loved it... cause I did it so much.

I jumped into the shower... turned the facet back-forth, hot-cold hot-cold with one hand to snap out of the anxiety-dysphoria, slam a sixteen-pounder down with the other,  pour some of it over my head... for some goddamn reason, grab some goof-balls off the sink, chew 'em up, regurgitate it some, hit the sweet-spot, throw the shower curtain open... after all the hot water is spent. 

I'm primed, I'm good to go.

I clean the mirror off and take another look at my sorry ass self, I'm not looking so bad now, the glaze and haze is going away, there is some sign of life... I recognize that guy.

A buddy calls me and says 'hey... what ya' doing today man? you want to go down to the Fireside and shoot pool... darts?  Yeah... why not, I'm still look' for my bottom, maybe I'll find it there.'

Im 20. Got a dream job, position, everything in september. Long story short lasted a month, a change in leadership that went to some major disagreements.

I used to drink a few, 2-3, shots of gin or vodka a night to help with sleep. Well after the above...2 months blind drunk every night.

One morning i wake up and for the first time since i started drinking i felt the shakes. Naturally like the rational, logical man that i am i didn't stop and started drinking more.

I tried cold turkey and the second day, at night, i was feeling the matress vibrating from my way to high heartbeat. 2 glasses of wine solved it. 

Tolerance is also way higher than it used to. I mean if i drank a bottle of wine before i baerly managed to get in bed. Now...i go trough two of them and i feel i could do more.

Two days ago i started sipping. Drunk enough so that i dont feel WDs.

I don't have a problem drinking responsibly. I can stop once i start. I wanted to ask u guys for some advice on tappering off.

As mentioned above i want to quit, or just get rid of the addiction part, whichever. I just don't know who or where to ask for advice. Thanks for reading.",3

I've definitely been contemplating stopping, and I have for months at a time in the past. I recently finished a course at uni about drugs and behaviour, and in it I learned about the horrible effects of withdrawal.

I also have about $15 to my name for the next 5 days, which in canada is about enough for a 373ml bottle. I'm extremely worried that in the next 24 hours I'll start having worse symptoms, like a seizure, and possibly DT. Its terrifying, and I'm alone. My question is... how likely is it I'll make it to payday to be able to buy a bottle and wean myself off of it? How likely is it that by the 48 hr mark post-drink (that's in 24 hours) I'll be in deep shit? I feel fine physically at the moment. No headaches, no tenderness, no nausea or vomiting or fever. I believe a year or so ago I quit cold turkey and had no side effects, so maybe I'll be fine again this time? Or maybe I should see a doctor tomorrow to be safe. I just don't know. I'm scared. At the moment I'm drinking lots of water and taking multi vitamins.
Any ideas?

I was in a funk… think’n it was in the Summer of’93; It was too hot, I couldn't sleep... I couldn't stay awake, felt tight... put some britches on, grabbed the key's to the Mustang and headed to a familiar old haunt. 

I was hunkering down, trying to slip my skin, melt into the folds of this popular smoke filled hall, rocking in my rickety Twelve Step chair, balancing on two legs, tripping-out on the smoke signals coming off my cig in the ashtray next to the candle, slowly drifting up, like my thoughts… integrating into the collective alcoholic abyss of Twelve-Step folklore —
— Stark raving sober, sit’n on my hands, knee bouncing-beating like a hummingbirds heart… think’ ‘oh God please don’t let them call on me tonight… I’m too bent to talk, and I just can’t tonight.’

Candlelight meeting’ at Wanda’s were notoriously entertaining and unpredictable, I hold a high-degree in combat sobriety from that Hall alone.

Hot summer nights and early sobriety, mulling over stupid shit I invented in my head at the time, to make life as complicated as possible… where I’m comfortable, and yet, still reaching for solace.

I like the candlelight meetings, things get very real in the middle of the night… candid and brutally honest... when the ghost won’t let you sleep, and everywhere you go feels haunted… dead, ‘cept those dim-lit candle-light meetings in the middle of the night, in the middle of the storms, in the middle of nowhere, hunkered-down with the rest of the lost souls.

There is indeed refuge in the Twelve Step Program. To be with like minded weirdo’s stirring up ghost…’round tables, in canting-enchanting stories, to exercise the demons near and far in the wee hours of morning.

The wisdom, dear God, the wisdom.

My attention got jacked to a particular elder sober yapping his flap. As clear as a Vodka I could hear him say — 
“yens all damn well better be saving a seat for your kids around these table’s.” — I have no recall of what he said afterword… small wonder that is, but that statement slammed into my head like a wreaking-ball run riot.

I thought about my four sons; I got three of them within three years, from two different mothers, I know right… but anyway, It just struck me so profoundly. Jesus Christ…. if my boys have this alcoholic gene… it’s going to take them down the same road as it had done me… in. I could not shake the feeling, it still resonates in my heart, like one of those things you put in the garden to make the moles go away… buzzes every so often, to protect the garden.

There is no way to fully express-convey the magnitude of the gratitude of my sobriety and for the Twelve Step Program, for the people who put up with me, spoon-fed me the Big-Book, brought me back to health, but I'll try. I was one of ‘those' hopeless-helpless alcoholic out of your goddamn mind alcoholics.  I have been given such privilege, honor, a gift, to be able to raise my babies sober under the umbrella of the Twelve Step Program, its principals... from birth, hitherto. 

A sober alcoholic, teaching his kids about ‘sobriety,’ meaning; ‘soundness of mind-body-soul.
Not that I did it well, I'm not the poster-boy for recovery, but the nuts and bolts of it was passed on. 

I passed it on, like I was told by my elder statesman, and grateful for the instruction.
All of my children have sat in many an ‘open’ meeting with me when they were young. They went to routine functions, get together’ with me. I adopted this way of life for myself, and for my children, unbeknownst to them, with intention, early on and as recent as up to couple years ago —

— I took my eldest girl to an A.A. meeting with me while back; she fit like hand and glove, I didn’t know whether to be more terrified she’s a drunk or black-belt codependent. But the fact she fit in as well as she did… echoed louder than thunder. She knows the ‘language of the heart,’ its people, and they know her.’ Savvy acid test for those wondering just how much influence recovery has on your kids.

Alcoholism is a progressive, generational illness, Recovery is a progressive generational healer. In the past thirty years I have made many mistakes, many corrections. One thing is certain, Recovery has been central theme in my life. It’s a way of life that feels, at times, very foreign… alienating perhaps. 

What I may laugh at with some kind of humility, may make and ordinary earthling cringe or a sailor blush.

My children are growing, changing, learning hard lessons like the rest… I get to wondering sometimes if they’re looking at their moral compass’ and maps I gave them early on, to navigate through this world.
As a parent I hoped all those tools of life given so freely to me, — training for life, spiritual boot-camp would set up in their souls, in spite of my own imperfections as a parent, a human being. I hoped it'd worked them like it did me, and it is pure joy when you see its reality unfold.

The wisdom I received in that candlelight meeting decades ago, from One person sharing their story, their wisdom… so freely given, made a huge impact on my life, and maybe for generations of children.

So, yes, “save a seat for the kids around the tables.”

My mom is an alcoholic. She was drinking 2 days ago, drank yesterday, but I didn’t think she’d drink today and with me in the car.

About 30 minutes into the drive, I noticed she was swerving. I called her out on it. Then, she pulled over and asked if I wanted to try to drive the Tesla to the supercharger. I was surprised because she said that she would never let me drive this car. But I knew she was drinking at that point and I just wanted to get the trip over with. Tesla driving is 10/10. But my anxiety was crazy high since I was now going to have to drive my super drunk mother 7 hours into the mountains with an expensive car. I also never have driven more than an hour at a time before. So this was a crazy surreal experience for me. But at least she wasn’t driving and that’s all that mattered.

1.5 hours into the trip and we reached the Tesla super charger station. She said before that she had to pee, but now that she was able to go, refused to leave the car. I said “alright” and then I went into a store to use the restroom while the car was charging. I’m guessing she downed a lot of alcohol in that time from her tumbler that she had with her. She doesn’t let me touch it. And I’m guessing she didn’t want me to be alone in the car because she couldn’t take her tumbler and I would be able to smell the alcohol in it.

So I decide that I can’t take it anymore. We are now 2 hours away from home. I have no idea where I am, having to look after my wasted mother. So I texted my dad, grandfather, and boyfriend to come get us. 

They’re about 30 minutes away from us now, and we’re currently sitting in a McDonald’s parking lot in a random city until they arrive. My dad will drive the Tesla with my mom in it and I’m going to be driving in the car with my grandfather and boyfriend.

I’m done with this. We’ve talked to her. She doesn’t care about me anymore now, especially because she was drinking and driving with me in the car. My dad is so angry. Like crazy angry with her. If he divorces her, I understand. But I’m always going to be on his side because he’s my dad and he’s been dealing with this for a year. I just found out about this 2 weeks ago. It’s really destroyed me. I feel like I always have to babysit her.

She ends up getting alcohol and downing it while she drives, since my dad banned alcohol in the house because of her. She drives while she drinks. She went to get snacks this morning before I woke up, which she did get, but I know she got alcohol too, filled her tumbler with it, and then threw away the wine cartons in the public trash so it wouldn’t be in our trash. But while I was driving and she was passed out from being drunk, I picked up her tumbler and smelled it. Straight alcohol.

I’m not safe at the moment, I’m scared, and I want her to get help. I never thought she’d do this with me in the car.",10

I always end up a right mess, since around 17. Im now 25. 

My Mam was an alcoholic, she died age 50 due to a stroke (brain aneurysm). I believe it was seizure related. I have had a very bad childhood with physical, mental and some sexual abuse. I have been through many foster homes. Got kicked out of many, due to my wild behaviour.  

Due to my mam being an alcoholic as a child id ask for some of the alcohol she was having and she would give me it, this was from the age of 6. I believe she did this due to my severe ADHD to calm me down. She would also give me more of my medication to calm me down too, i was on ritalin at the time and it used to comatose me. When pregnant she was unaware of it so drank and the hospital beleived i was born alcohol dependent as id constantly scream in the first 6 months of being born. Due to my bad ADHD i had to have sleeping tablets to sleep from the age of 7.

I was a really bad kid/teenager. I would set fires, smash up bus stops, windows, vandalize just about anything, you name it. I was in with a bad crowd. In school i would smash the toilets or certain parts of the school up, would throw bins down flights of stairs and they would smash ect, ect.

This drinking got worse during my nights out at university. I got thrown out of clubs a few times for being too drunk. At this stage i didn't drink alone, only socially.  I have made myself ill at times by taking E's and mixing it with alcohol, but that's normal in this day and age. I have smoked weed quite alot, but that never became a bad habit or addiction. Haven't touched it in a long time. 

I've been taking home by the police before by not being able to walk, then them spotting me. I have been fortunately found once when passed out on the grass while attempting to walk home, i have been to hospital twice for falling and cutting my face open and done many other crazy things. 

I have been in hospital twice also for trying to take overdoses due to suicide attempts, and have a huge history of self harm. On one occasion i fled the hospital only to have the police bring me back. I did drive for 5 years, never under the influence. But one night after a bad breakup that really affected me, i got very drunk and sped dangerously around my area and crashed my car. It was like a suicide attempt, i didn't expect to come back from it. I got charged with dangerous and drink driving. This landed me a suspended sentence, and a 2 year driving ban and i almost  went to prison. I now need a medical and an advanced driving test to drive again. I am very lucky to be alive as i was doing 70mph in a 30 zone and only didn't have a massive wreck as the car skidded after a bend in the road which slowed it down and it hit a high kerb before clipping a parked car, and then i hit a wall. The airbags didn't go off, it was litterally the skidding and the kerb that slowed the car right down. I walked away without a scratch before being arrested. Although bad im just thankful i didn't hurt anyone as what i did was very dangerous. 

Im diagnosed with ADHD and Borderline personality disorder. And have traits of PTSD anxiety and depression. 

I started to get bad withdrawals symptoms after just one night out when at university, id hallucinate, have convulsions be covered in sweat and be unable to walk due to full body shakes. Then id have awful nightmares. I thought it was a bad hangover, how wrong i was. These only lasted 2 days though. And the second day wasn't as bad.

When i started working i made a daily habit of drinking everynight after work to forget and relax which didnt help me mentally, id be abit rough the next day. But id grab a wrap from my local supermarket, down an energy drink and id be off like a rocket, then would perform awesome during my shifts. Id have times when i didn't drink after work, this was on and off over a couple of years. I would cycle to work and everything felt fine. 

I then started noticing id end up shakey when finishing work before id have my next drink. I had some time off and became alcohol dependent as i binged for about 9 days just constant drinking all day, and had severe withdrawals when stopping. I got in touch with my gp and alcohol services and tapered, then managed to stop 3 times being sober about 2/3 weeks each time. I had to take time off work during this as i was required to drink at least every 4 hours and i can't drink while working. Fortunately work understood due to my honesty. I have been off about 7 month now, was on a phased return which lasted 2 weeks but relapsed, took some more time off, had another phased return but busted my hand which required surgery, which il mention later. So im still off work. 

I relapsed again and after a 3 day binge i had to continue drinking due to severe withdrawal symptoms. I have been staying at my girlfriend's and i needed more alcohol due to my withdrawals and couldnt get it myself due to full body shakes and she refused (i dont blame her) to get me any. I went 30 hours without any alcohol and was having very violent convulsions that felt like my stomach was being ripped open, was constantly vomiting, couldnt keep water down i hadn't ate or kept water down properly in 2 days and was hallucinating really bad, closed eyed hallucinations, open eyed ones and was hearing things. And was sweating like a tap. Even tapering off before this i could barely eat, due to constant vomiting. And in my last tapering episode i vomited some blood. Anyways i believed i was having seizures so got took to hospital, they gave me two doses of benzodiazepines to stop the withdrawal and put me on a drip consistent of nutrients. They use a scale to measure alcohol withdrawal, the highest being 20, i was 37.

 I recently had surgery on my hand due to an accident two weeks prior and was withdrawing before that despite drinking before going for it to help. I told the nurse i was withdrawing and got given benzodiazepines, then she said she worked in the intensive care unit aswell as the fracture clinic. Where they put many patients with severe alcohol withdrawal in a coma for 7 days to detox you, and she belived thats where i needed to be really. I objected as that sounded very scary. So just had the surgery and hoped to taper off myself. I just wanted to go home, i was there for 10 hours. 

Moving on, the Dr who assesed me when i went to hospital during them violent convulsions which i thought were seizures, said i wasn't having seizures because i was awake and aware during them. But was having violent muscle contractions/convulsions. I asked if i could be detoxed at hospital as my withdrawals are really painful and got told no. I have to keep drinking but slowly taper myself off. I informed him that a nurse during my surgery mentioned intensive care detox. But the doctor said they will only hospital detox you if you are having blackout seizures and only then they will put you in intensive care. Even my gp and alcohol service have all said i need to taper, but its clearly not working and i keep relapsing. I can't really afford the alcohol either. I got up to 1 litre of vodka a day. 

Like what do i do, i have made all the right steps to change and solve this problem, i have only been alcohol dependent for about 7 months but had bouts of sobriety at times too and the dependency happens even just off one heavy night out. The alcohol service basically just said im one of the unlucky ones where my body struggles to adjust to equilibrium after any kind of binge. I really want to stop. As i have stopped before many times, the alcohol service said its not so much an alcohol problem, its a mental health problem in which i use alcohol as a coping mechanism but im prone to getting dependent. But the mental health team won't help me with medication, due to the presence of alcohol being involved. 

What do i do ? Go cold turkey and let myself possibly die by having a seizure in order to get treatment, taper off and possibly die by having a seizure? Because even tapering, my symptoms still get ridiculously bad. I have had to crawl to the bathroom many times, due to not being able to walk.

 I just dont know what to do. Me and my family are furious that im basically told to unsafely taper off myself. They wont give me benzodiazepines either to help as too many people have abused and overdosed, so there's a nationwide stop on them if alcohol is involved. 

Im just fed up. Im at rock bottom and trying to get help. If i cant taper enough till i get my sick pay from work im going to end up back at hospital, only to be sent home and told to drink, again... unless i actually have a seizure. 

I was doing so well in life despite my horrible past, i graduated with a Forensic psychology degree, had my own place to live (still have that), a full time job and a nice car with a private plate on it. I have plenty of friends and family and i neglect that too due to drinking. :(

Every withdrawal period i have it gets so much worse. I have done my research and its called a kindling effect. Im aware of what's going on, i did my dissertation on alcohol, i have just been such an idiot. 

I know what i need. I just don't know what to do, as i won't get any help.",3
2019-12-12 08:22:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e9nhey/reflecting_on_4_years_sober_and_what_brought_me/,Reflecting on 4 years sober and what brought me to this place,"Last month marked my fourth year without touching alcohol after *nine years* of drinking. I haven't shared my experience much, and never my complete experience - and a part of me wants to. I don't know if anyone will want to hear it but I want write it all out for me, and I want to release it. I want to share it because if anyone can connect to my story and relate to my experience, well, that means neither of us are alone. So here goes.

Really my story starts at birth and early childhood is a complex chapter, but since this is a reddit post and not an autobiography I'm going to summarize it by saying I was very loved, but my parents weren't perfect, especially my father. While living with my father, I was emotionally abused from the time I was very young, as long as I can remember. There were also periods of neglect, and I didn't have a 'proper' childhood. No bedtime, no bath time, no dinner time; like an adult I was allowed to care for myself how I saw fit and I played emotional caretaker to my 50 something year old father.

As a young child I was depressed and pervasively lonely. I never wanted to be alone with myself and my feelings. Every night I fell asleep in front of the TV, because the voices made me feel less alone. Since I was not properly cared for, I did poorly in school and even as a child in primary school I knew that teacher's and peer's parents looked as me as a bad influence or the kind of child that they did not want their child associating with. I knew I stupid, I knew I was a bad seed, I knew that I would never amount to anything. For lack of a better word, I knew I was a fuck up.

I felt so different from all other children and I was so sensitive and fragile emotionally, I didn't want to venture into the outside world. At the same time I had a rebellious streak, likely because I had no rules or discipline at home. And in the seventh grade I discovered alcohol. I had met a group of girls I could relate to at another school. They were 'bad' kids too and with them, I felt I fit in a bit more. The first time I got drunk at one of their houses I took a few swigs from a bottle of Malibu, and weighing about 90 pounds at the time, it was enough to get me nice and drunk. Right away, from the first time the alcohol hit, I wanted more. I loved how the drunk felt, and I loved how I didn't feel.

The next time I drank alcohol a few weeks later at a girlfriends house, I couldn't get enough and kept drinking more until I blacked out, I woke up in the hospital that next morning covered in bruises and hooked up to an IV, looking into my mother's worry-stricken face. I almost died that night. The doctors had been close to putting me on a life support machine as they could find no sign that I was going to wake up. But I survived that night and woke up for the first time (of many to come) filled with alcohol-induced shame and regret and vowed never to drink alcohol again. My sobriety lasted a couple of months.

In grade eight, new to high school, I really dove into drinking. Since I already knew I was a stupid problem child who wouldn't amount to anything, partying was the best thing in my life. I lived for it. Since I didn't care about school or hobbies, I cared, instead, about being cool, getting invited to parties, getting attention from boys, dressing the part, and of course, getting drunk. So I was quite popular for a while, although I wasn't a very nice person at this point in time. But my popularity didn't last long. I had no off switch when I was drinking, and I blacked out almost every single time I drank alcohol. To that end, I was an out of control drunk, a sloppy mess. I earned a bad reputation and became an outcast by the time I was about 14. Everyone hated me. Since I had been suffering from depression and intense loneliness forever, losing my friends was hell.

I became more depressed than ever before. I began drinking alone at home during the week nights, chain smoking cigarettes, and I sometimes drank at school when things got bad socially and, therefore, emotionally. I cut myself, put cigarettes out on my arms and each night I tried to work up the courage to end my life. That summer, I slept until 3 or 4 o'clock everyday. I had been prescribed an excessive amount of tylenol 3 from a dental surgery and since it makes you very drowsy, I would take it when I woke up in the morning, so I could immediately go back to sleep. I hated being awake. Finally I became so desperate that I told my parents how depressed I was. I told them that if things continued the way they were, I would survive but if they got *any* worse, I would end my life. My parents took me to therapy, and I dropped out of my high school due to the bullying.

Eventually, I met friends from a different school and things returned basically to how they were before. Living to party, be cool and pretty. Except, now since I had been cast out as a deviant outcast, I embraced that 'deviance', and wore it like a badge of pride. My loneliness, as bad as ever, ate away at me and I desperately wanted to find a guy to fix me. At 15, I found him. He has a very nice boy, much too nice for a mess like me, truth be told. I clung dysfunctionally to the relationship, codependent from the get-go.

Near the tail-end of 15 I got a fake ID and began frequenting sleazy bars and clubs. Now my out of control, blackout drinking was taken to the town with the adults. I grew bored of my relationship with my nice boyfriend and left him at 16 when I developed a crush on a 23 year old man I kissed at the bar; we began dating shortly after.

I all but moved in with him at 17 and clung to him dysfunctionally. Luckily he treated me well. I felt OK when I was with him, the pain stopped, but on occasion, when he didn't want to hangout and I had to spend the night at home, the pain was intense. The emotional pain of loneliness felt physical in my heart, chest and stomach, and I'd cry myself to sleep. Eventually we really moved in together and things felt better. I still lived to party and my drinking was still out of control, and the shame overs were just getting worse and worse.

After one night of drinking I'd wake up to the most intense depression and anxiety that would last at least a few days to a week. I'd vow never to drink again, only to last a few days or maybe a week. I was perplexed by the fact that none of my friends seemed to share my experience. Their hangovers consisted of headaches and maybe throwing up. Mine was heavily emotional.

Since my boyfriend wasn't as big of a drinker as I was, and he actually had hobbies and a job, I went out drinking often without him. I got myself into many extremely risky situations and, in retrospect, I am incredibly lucky to be alive. I drunkenly got into many strange men's cars for rides (complete strangers on the street), got into the car with drunk drivers, and wandered alone, blackout-wasted through the sketchiest places in the city at all hours of the night. The details of these stories, while too in depth to get into, were shocking. I did very shameful things to my sweet mother, from stealing her money to kicking in her windshield in a drunken rage. I also got myself into trouble in my friendships due to shameful things I did when I was blackout (although luckily I never was cast out again).

At 19 I was bored of my relationship and I left my boyfriend. For the next few months I was single, I shutdown the club often and dabbled with hard drugs at after parties. I also discovered marijuana and for the first time in my life I felt like I'd found the solution. The marijuana took away the loneliness. I could actually *enjoy* spending time alone. All my life I'd hated night time due to my insomnia and the fact that the rest of the world went to sleep and I was all alone with myself... weed changed that. I could go home at night and feel content in my own company, and I could sleep easily. I was finally going to be ok. I didn't *need* anyone, *I* was ok. But I found someone anyways.

He was different than anyone I'd ever been with before. My past boyfriends had been calm, introverted, artistic, gentle, kind, soft spoken types. This new guy was rebellious, charming, a party animal, and generally up to no good, but he was very handsome. I fell for him, but for the first time I wanted to maintain my newfound independence, and maybe only hangout once or twice a week. He had other ideas.

He wanted to spend all of our time together, and he'd cry when I'd leave. I felt so bad for him, I knew how it felt to be that lonely and I didn't want him to hurt the way that I had hurt. So I compromised my independence to protect him. I felt suffocated and discontent so I began smoking more weed to numb my feelings. I went from a nightly smoker to smoking first thing in the morning and walking around all day in a daze. We also partied together quite a bit as we were both big drinkers. In fact, on one occasion when we were out together, I fell 20 feet and wound up in the emergency - my second stint there. I ended up having to get surgery twice as a result. I still haven't gotten over the damage that did to my body.

My boyfriend and I spent literally all our time together, and so I grew dependant on him and the relationship. Not soon after, he began lying to me, little things at first, but soon became downright deceitful, manipulative and emotionally abusive. He knew how dependant I'd grown, so when I tried to hold him accountable for his actions, he would threaten to leave me. I was as addicted to him as I was to the weed, if not more; being separated was painful. Especially because I knew he was cheating on me and if I wasn't with him, then where was he?

Previously I had always been that person who saw girls in bad relationships and considered them dumb, why didn't they leave? I had no idea how naive that judgement was until I was in one, myself. The truth is, unless you've experienced that form of abuse, you just don't get it. Emotionally abusive relationships are incredibly addictive (I think due to the cycle of extreme highs and lows), freeing yourself is intensely difficult.

I lost about 20 pounds and my hair began falling out. I woke up with pain in the pit of my stomach every morning at about 5 am. I felt like I was dying. I was so addicted to him and our relationship was killing me and he didn't care, he had no empathy for me - he only cared about himself. He was cruel to me on so many occasions. He knew I was broken and he kicked me while I was down. When I tried to hold any power in the relationship he made sure break me down further. He only wanted to party with his friends, but he allowed me to tag along as his powerless, defeated sidekick. I didn't want to party anymore, in the face of my all encompassing misery I could not handle any additional drinking induced suffering.

After about a year, I realized that he would never change. Although I was completely addicted to the relationship and I didn't think I could ever be happy without him or love someone else, I wanted to get out. I wanted to hold onto faith that there would be something better for me on the other side. I tried to break up with him a few times, but if the emotional pain of being away from him wasn't bad enough, his suicide threats were. He'd promise to change, tell me every single thing I wanted to hear, and if that didn't work, he'd threaten suicide. I'd take him back, and things would be better for a while, but they always went back.

I self medicated with smoking weed constantly, I don't know that I would have survived without it. Not only did it allow me to stomach food every so often, it dulled the suffering a little (and every little bit counted). It helped me stay alive. As well as my precious mother, bless her heart, who nurtured me with loving kindness, compassion and total acceptance. She did not leave my side, made sure I ate at least a couple bites of food and forced me to drink gatorade. She took me on walks and talked and talked things through with me from every angle. She stayed with me until I fell asleep. She rubbed sage oil on my tummy to soothe its burning pit. She is an angel, my angel. She helped me heal.

So did a close male friend of mine. He was clean and sober, the only person I knew at that time who was, and he became my best friend. He picked me up and we'd go for drives and he'd be there for me, gently urging me to take a path in life that would lead me away from suffering and towards happiness. I gradually began to love him more and more.

I went to therapy, I built support systems outside of the relationship, I spent lots of hours and hours alone in nature, and I got stronger and stronger. Eventually, I knew there was life outside of the relationship and I was hungry for it. I wanted out so bad, and the only problem left was that I didn't know how to break up with him and withstand his suicide threats and emotional manipulation. However, one day I kissed my best male friend, and I knew then that I had no choice but to break up. He was the cheater, not me. So I did it. When he realized this time I was serious, he begged and pleaded but I did not give in. It was done. I broke up with him just a couple months before our two year anniversary.

Although that relationship was one of the most painful experiences of my life, I am so incredibly grateful for it. I am stronger than ever before as a result of emerging from that battle. It also changed my concept of reality; before him I didn't know that there were people who would tell you they love you and then callously use you and treat you with no empathy, acting only in their own self-interest as they watch you wither away. Not only do I now know that it happens, I know it is common and I know how to spot those people. I also learned that I *never ever* want to treat anyone even in a remotely similar way to the way he treated me. I learned how to be a way better person and partner through that pain. I became stronger, smarter, wiser and kinder. I love this quote, ""life gives its greatest gifts wrapped up as your worse nightmare""...

However, I must add there is pain and frustration in having your experience devalued by friends and loved ones who just don't get how real and severely debilitating emotional abuse is.

I went out drinking a few times after we broke up, but alcohol wasn't what I was living for anymore. I had started to like myself and some pieces of my life and I didn't want to ruin my positive feelings with the depression of a hangover anymore. Likely, I was also influenced by falling in love with a sober person. In any event, I decided to quit drinking (for the millionth time) one morning upon waking up hungover after a relatively uneventful night out (nothing compared to the rock bottoms I'd faced with drinking). This time, at 21 years old, it was lasting. (Although I was still smoking weed).

A couple months after the breakup, I ended up dating my friend. He didn't know I was smoking weed and I was scared for him to find out because I thought he'd leave me, so I hid it. I tried to quit, but I couldn't. It was too painful, I'd end up alone at night balling my eyes out and I would give up - I couldn't do it, so I hid it. I think I hid it for a year before I could no longer carry the weight of the guilt. I tearfully confessed to my boyfriend that I was smoking weed nightly behind his back when he was asleep, fully expecting him to leave me. He didn't, he accepted me. He didn't hold my lies against me, instead he held while I cried.

For the first year or two of my sobriety (from alcohol) I missed drinking terribly. I didn't know who I was without drinking. Drinking and partying had been a huge component of my identity (perhaps the biggest). Suddenly I wasn't wild, I wasn't rebellious, I wasn't extraverted. Instead, I was shy, introverted, quiet. I didn't recognize myself and that was deeply uncomfortable. I went back and forth on whether or not I was going to give in and drink. If it wasn't for the fear of losing my boyfriend and the fear of a hangover filled with shame and regret, I probably would have caved, but I didn't.

Not knowing what to do with all my free time now that I didn't party and therefore, wasn't always out of commission with a hangover, I searched for other meaning, a different identity and something to fill my time. I went to university because I didn't know what else to do. I had always considered myself stupid, I think everybody did... So going to university was not something I'd ever even considered but I decided to enrol at a local small university that would accept me. I had never done homework or studied in elementary or high school so I didn't really have any idea how that worked (as weird and dumb as that sounds), I just assumed that stuff was easy for smart people or they didn't really have to study because they were smart.

Anyways, on my first midterm of the year I decided to try studying, although I honestly felt like I had no idea how to do that, but I tried reading the assigned chapters. I walked into the midterm with the usual test-taking dread, pretty sure I would do as poorly as I usually did at school. I didn't think the studying would make any difference. I was in total shock when I got back a 97%. I kept studying for my other midterms and actually doing my homework, and I kept getting high grades. I was in utter disbelief. It finally occurred to me that it wasn't that I was stupid all those years. The other kids parents had been making them do their homework and probably helping them - or at the very least they were doing those things on their own. And I had never done any of that. When I did that stuff, I was actually a superior student. I now have one year left in my degree, and I have done quite well. When I transferred to a bigger university to complete my degree, the academic advisor asked me whether I was considering law school (based on my grades). Me? Wow. This also changed my concept of reality and what I can accomplish if I want to.

Also, two years ago, I finally tried the hobby I had desperately wanted to try my whole life that I had never tried because I had always told myself I was a failure and there was no point of trying. At that first dance class, I loved it so much I have never looked back. The feeling I get from dancing is like nothing else, it changed my life completely. Dancing allowed me to feel that each day is a gift, an opportunity for me to go out and pursue my passion. It doesn't matter if I 'fail' because it brings me so much happiness that there's no way thats failing, even if I suck. Now I go to class every day, and train hard. I believe how hard I work makes a difference, instead of thinking that I am useless without trying.

At about two years into my sobriety the desire to drink fell away. I became so, so grateful for my sobriety (from alcohol). While drinking, none of this could have ever happened. Sobriety was the integral condition which has allowed me to grow into who I am today. I am a whole new person with a whole new perspective on life. Today I see my life as a precious gift.

Over the four years I've been sober, I have still been in and out of heavy marijuana use. I go a couple months on, using dysfunctionally and a couple months off (straight edge) before I relapse. I feel better without it but for some reason I go back to it. Currently I am 4 days into a quit. I now believe that I am strong enough to live without it. I don't cry sleeping alone in my bed at night. I am OK. I am enough. There are still sad moments, there are still problems (many), but I know that's okay, I know it's a part of life and I know I can handle it. I want to keep growing stronger and I think at this point thats best accomplished clean and sober. I hope this time I can make it.

I guess there's no way anyone made it to the end of this novel, and to be honest, there is so much I left out to try to make it shorter, you can't really condense your life into one reddit post anyways - but this was my best shot. Love to all.",30

Been staring at the ceiling for hours. I’m struggling. I just recently said out loud to myself I have a drinking problem and I need to do something about that now before my health declines. So there’s that. 

This has been a slow process over the last couple of months in which I tried to not drink for longer periods of time. Most I managed was 2 weeks. Right now I’ve been sober for 48 hrs with the firm intention to keep it that way. I will be attending a meeting this thursday for the first time and I’ll take it from there. So far, all good. 

I do have a very great fear which I would like some advice with, and that is my beautiful partner. We’ve been together for little over 2 years now, but we’ve known eachother for over 10 years and have always been very close. I am very much in love and so is she. She’s been just drinking for the last 7 years or so where I have been drinking for at least 30. She supports me and we have no secrets about anything. I have had some bad spells struggling with depression and a major burn-out and she has always been there for me. But this is different now. I need this, to quit drinking but I can’t expect her to do the same and it scares the living shit out of me. She likes a glas of wine after work and she likes to go out, to dinner and cafe and party. And she can get really shitfaced at times. Things I think I need to stay away from. At least for the time being, going through the first month or two. 

I explained to her why I need and want to quit, and she says she understands but at the same time there are little signals that make me scared. We’ll be talking on the phone and she’ll tell me she’s having a wine or looking forward to some dinner or party. Normal things before, but right now not so much for me. I am afraid we will clash over alcohol in the near future because she says she can stop at any time but just simply doesn’t feel the need to or want to. And like I said, I can’t and don’t expect her to, I have a problem. She doesn’t (yet). 

Any experience with this situation out there? It has been on my mind 24/7 lately. Thanks for bearing with me",2
2019-12-10 21:27:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e90tts/day_one/,Day one.,"So I've known I've had a problem with alcohol for a while now. My wife and I always had a bad relationship with it, but when she got pregnant, she was of course forced to stop. Our baby is almost a year and a half now, and while I see her slip sometimes (more with her randomly hiding it, or an occasional 6 am beer, than every really being intoxicated) she's got it under control.

I, despite having a new family and a lot more responsibility, never really was able to make that last step to a healthy middle ground. I'd go grab some shots after finishing up my restaurant shift when I should be going home. If we got into a fight, or I was feeling anxious I would go to the bar and have like 6-8 drinks on top of whatever beer I had already drank that day. I would wake up and have a beer and smoke on the porch.

Then it finally happened. I got a DUI. Nobody was hurt, thankfully, because I was wayyy over the line. I went to a few meetings from various sobriety groups, but I would still come home and drink, even if it was a little, but often it wasn't.

And tho Virginia's ASAP program is largely a money making scam, I appreciate it for one reason. It's making me stop, even if it's for a few days at a time. I'm not going to fail the program, I have a family and responsibilities to tend to.

So anyway, today is the first day I haven't drank in probably about seven years. It feels weird, and if I'm honest, I wish I could continue to use cannabis while doing this, as it would help with my nerves, but oh well. 

Sorry if that was a bit rambley, but it took so much self control to not walk to the corner store as soon as so got home, so I just needed to get some thoughts outta my Head.


Update- well it seems that my ASAP testing/treatment doesn't actually even start until the end of the month. Gonna continue to not drink because why not? If I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do it. Thanks for listening.",10

**Why search for happiness when you can find it in a bottle?**

Most weeks I have around 1-2 drinks three nights a week and then usually a binge on Friday or Saturday 2-3 times a month. It used to be that these binges would be around 5 drinks over 5-6 hours. Because of my size that would bring me to around .8-.9 BAC.

Lately though (the last few months) my binges have increased to being around a BAC of .15 which is really scary and not that hard when you only weigh 115 pounds. It all started when I tried to cut back. I would take a month or a week off and then have a scary binge a few weeks after it was over. The really scary part, after a party I went to last Saturday where I had a particularly ""good time"" I am now having what I think are withdrawal symptoms.

Something similar happened around a month ago but I chalked it up to a seasonal cold but now I'm pretty sure it's caused by detoxing after a binge. I've never had anything like it before. Mostly night sweats and clammy hands. High anxiety but I have been diagnosed with anxiety for the last 10 years so that's not super telling. I had a dizzy / hot flash spell at work yesterday while I was SITTING DOWN. It might have been low blood sugar, too much coffee and no water intake or it could have been something way worse than that.

I went from admittedly someone who needed to cut back to someone who is now alcohol dependent??? How did this happen so quickly? As a note I would have Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays without drinking in the past and not see these symptoms.   


I spoke with my husband about it and he agrees that if I just stuck to the 1-2 drinks at home a few nights a week and cut out the binges  I would be fine but with the kindling effect I'm worried I'll start to detox every time I drink.",6

Just thought i'd update for anyone who saw my original post 2 months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/dbrsij/1_month_down_today/) 

Wanted to let people know that i've kept it up, just hit 100 days this morning, it's been going great, i still have lows and highs but they aren't artificial anymore, anything i feel and do is all me, no boozy blackouts, no dreading looking at my phone for texts or pictures from the night before that i can't remember, i've been present for my family and things are honestly much better.

I've also taken up running, regularly hitting 40 km a week and training for a half marathon early next year.

Anyone just starting out, you can do this, it gets much easier. Anyone further on the journey than me, i'll get to your level some day.

Hope you all have a fantastic and sober day",16

2019-12-10 01:10:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e8ms0b/need_advice_on_how_to_help_my_boyfriend/,Need Advice on how to help my boyfriend,"Hi, this is an alt account because my other account is tied to a lot of my irl stuff...   
I don't even know where to start so I guess I'll just start at the beginning.  
My boyfriend and I met a few years ago through some mutual friends, we eventually hit it off but I went through some really hard times. When I moved in with him we both were really heavy drinkers. Most nights drinking multiple malt beers alongside an 18 pack, and those nights didn't even compare to the nights we drank liquor... I hated how I felt and how my friends perceived me, but most of all I hated my dependency on it. So one day I just decided I'm done, and I stopped drinking. That was a little over a year ago now. And I feel a lot more free, lost a ton of weight, and never get cravings anymore. But my boyfriend still drinks a lot, albeit a LOT less than he used to. He doesn't get drunk anymore, but he still drinks around 8-10 beers every single night.  
I've been trying to help him ever since I stopped. I've expressed how much it affects me, and how I grew up with two alcoholic parents and an addict brother and that I'm not interested in bringing our future children into this type of environment. I was able to get him down to four beers per night at one point, but the stress on me was just too much. I get a lot of anxiety at night because of it. A few times he's gotten really upset about my nagging to the point where he says I'm like a dictator, which I think is not a very good look when you're in a relationship. He admits openly that he has an issue and tells me a lot that he wants to get better.  
There have been 3 major incidences that I never want to revisit. The first was when I still drank and we got into an argument and he got in his car and disappeared. I found him at a bar and drove him home. The second was kind of recently when I went to bed a little earlier than him (around midnight), but forgot to feed the animals, so I got up to feed them and found he was gone. I looked for him, and when I opened the door to the house I saw him literally running away?? Neither of us can understand why he would do this. He disappeared for an hour. I was driving around everywhere looking for him and he was so embarrassed that he wouldn't tell me where he was. I told him that's a huge breach of trust and he can not be sneaky in our relationship.  
That brings us to the third incident, we had an anniversary recently and I participated in some drinking to celebrate. This gave him the opportunity to drink more than usual, so the next night I walked in on him trying to hide a malt beer can from me. I asked ""are you hiding beer?"" and he said ""yeah..."" he swore that was the first time he ever did it. I'm like ""are you just extraordinarily unlucky that you get caught every time you're sneaky?"" its really not cool that he's hiding things from me when he literally has no reason to. I stopped nagging him months ago and am just trying to be supportive, so I'm not sure why he's doing this.  
Anyway, I foolishly gave him an ""ultimatum"" around thanksgiving. I told him that if he goes back up to 10 beers every night that I'm leaving, he got kinda defensive/shut down and I felt bad about it. The thing is, I don't really want to leave. We have a really good relationship, except for the drinking. We're a great team, get along great, and I love his family a lot. I love my life here, but I don't want to invest my life in someone who I feel might not respect me enough to attempt to control this.

The reason I'm finally posting here about this is because I usually hang on to his keys after he buys 8 beers so that he has less of a craving to go back out for more (mutual agreement, most nights he voluntarily gives me his keys). Well tonight he tried to butter me up to go out and get some stuff he knew I wanted, and I said ""is this an excuse to go get more beer?"" and he said ""yeah kinda"" and I simply said ""I'm not going to lecture you, but it's a little alarming that you're-"" and he cut me off and said ""nope! nevermind! we're not going!"" and grabbed the last beer (a tall boy) out of the fridge and went onto his computer.  
I'm left here thinking ""what did I do wrong"" but genuinely I don't think I'm in the wrong. I need to voice my feelings or else he'll never know. And I don't appreciate being basically guilt tripped into feeling bad for not enabling him. I got him a portion of an edible (which he says help his cravings), and gave him a kiss and just let him be.  


Does anyone have advice of ways I can encourage him and support him without enabling? He's refused AA, therapy, and medical treatment whenever I've brought it up. But I think maybe he would consider naltrexone, but I have no resources to point him in that direction. Also, his mom and brother used to have really bad alcohol issues but eventually become sober and don't get cravings anymore.  
Please let me know if I can clarify on anything else.",2

We hit it off really well and hung out almost every day since meeting. He is smart, funny, successful, and very cute. He really has his shit together. I have been drinking 1-2 bottles of wine per day for years. He made it clear to me a week ago that he's doesn't like how much I drink and that I get mean when I'm drunk and start fights for no reason. I said I would stop drinking. 

We went to a party on Saturday at one of his friend's houses. I proceeded to drink at least a bottle of wine, possibly 2 (I really can't remember how much I drank). I blacked out and fought with him in the car on the ride home and apparently broke up with him. I have no idea why I did that because I am falling in love with him. The fight continued at his house and he eventually called the cops on me to get me to leave. I got a ride home and continued texting him and calling him, further pissing him off. He ended the relationship. I then drank 3/4 of a bottle of wine the next morning when I woke up and continued texting him. I started out begging for him to talk to me but then got angry and sent him really mean and horrible texts. 

He had actually reached out to my mom on Facebook and they chatted over the phone about my addiction (which i had no idea about until later in the day). I had to pick up my car from his house at some point and waited to sober up to call for an Uber.  When I got to his house he didn't want to talk me but eventually did. A little bit. He said he's been down this road before with a previous girlfriend and won't do it again. He said he hopes I get sober but never wants to talk to me again. I'm completely heartbroken because we were really great together when I was sober. We both acknowledged that. I said I would get sober for real and asked if he would be still want to date if I was sober. He said no, the damage has been done and never wants to speak to me again. I've been depressed and crying since this happened because I know we would have had a great relationship had I taken real steps towards sobriety earlier. I have been researching treatment centers and counselors in my area and will be setting up appointments today once they open. I guess I'm just looking for a little supports here, and hoping that I can eventually win him back by showing I'm serious about getting sober and taking the proper steps. Thanks for reading.",4

I have never slept with anyone else while together, not interested, but do dance with other girls. I still feel like a lying, POS, I don't want to be this drunk loser anymore. I want to stop drinking altogether. I've been binge drinking on and off since I was 14. I'm 38 now. I've been going out once every two months during last 2.5 years, when I was single it was every week. For last 2.5 years it's not enough to get tipsy, it seems I need to get completely wasted and doing regretful things I would never do if sober. I do love my girlfriend, this is a bad habit and must stop. The shame is too much. Since when did it become acceptable to deceive? I disgust myself. It's not how I want to live.

I started drinking around 17, a small town where partying was pretty much the norm. I started binge drinking alone around age 20, I was in a relationship at the time and it suffered because of my abuse with alcohol.

  I eventually moved to Texas after ending the relationship, hoping to get a fresh start. But as many as you probably know, your problems will follow you. This is where my drinking, and also drug exploration, got out of hand. Blowing all my money in bars then digging in my car for change, urging for a small bottle to curb the inevitable withdrawals. I was starting to lose trust from family and friends with broken promises and being inactive in my own life.

  After a few years I moved to California to stay with my brother, yet again hoping to stop my pattern. Unfortunately I did not. I continued drinking in his house, stealing liquor, replacing vodka with water etc. After waking up one Christmas morning, sobbing to my brother, we decided to remove all alcohol from the house and find me help. With meetings and support from family/friends I started my sober journey.
   
     5 months, relapse.
    
         6 months, relapse.
      
             8 months, relapse.
       
                 11 months.....relapse.
   
Finally, 2 years ago, I came across baking. Sourdough bread specifically, it gave me something to focus on, a goal to work twords. There is a living organism depending on you for it to live, and there is something primal about the process.
    

I got wind through my job that someone knew a person who owned a bakery. I got the info, set up an interview, and waited for the day....
The night before my interview I relapse, really intensely too, major chest pains and sickness. I wake up for my interview, head pounding, emotional, and disappointed. My keys are missing so I plead my roommate to drive me, he does. I do the interview, and by some miracle, I get the job. That night before, to today, was the last time I had a drink.
     

Now I’m 1 year, 9 months sober, a baker, charity member, hockey player, cosplayer and in the healthiest relationship of my life. I know this is a long post and you maybe didn’t make it this far, but all this is for is, don’t give up. No matter how low, or hopeless you feel, it can get better. Find a passion, as an addict I feel you can focus that ability into positive things, it’s just about slowly making the switch. One day at a time, I believe in you.",59

I admitted  I am an alcoholic about a year and a half ago to my doctor during an annual physical.  At that visit my  blood work was bad...high triglycerides, high BP, cholesterol, etc.  By this point drinking was an issue for me and my doctor suspected as much after our conversations over the years. He recommended AA or counseling...

My work provides me with  an employee assistance program and I met with a substance abuse counselor in the summer of 2018.  He performed a test (can't remember the name) that also concluded I am an alcoholic.   We met for about a month for weekly visits, but eventually my work provided visits ran out.  I could not afford the $120 weekly cost going forward and therefore quit going.

Since then I have struggled hard with alcohol abuse.  In the past year and a half I have made it twice for 10-14 days without drinking, and a few times going 2-3 days without it.  But generally I am drinking 3/4 to nearly a whole fifth of vodka or whiskey a day.

I have noticed a number of physical and mental issues starting to arise in the past 6 months including being very lethargic, crabby, and very unhappy when I am not drinking.  During the past two months when I have tried to quit drinking I have experienced extreme insomnia.  Night one and night two are terrible to the extent that I have hot sweats and restlessness and am lucky to fall asleep after ""going to bed"" 3-4 hours after trying to fall asleep.  By day 3 I have a lot of anxiety and coupled with lack of sleep I find an excuse to drink.

I work in sales which can be high stress.  I also have twins and a 3rd (unplanned) that followed 11 months after, so work and home life can be stressful (not to make an excuse).  When I hit the afternoon, 4-5 PM, I start craving a drink badly. Once I get the ""buzz"" I just want more and chase that buzz/feeling the entire evening. 

 Both of my grandfathers were alcoholics and I never imagined my college years of drinking would have brought me to this point. If anyone knows of a group or someone in the West Michigan area that could help me get on the right path, I would greatly appreciate it.  I know that I am killing myself with this poison....",4

I'm 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of self-harm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, I've gotten extremely depressed again. My ex-best friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that I've hurt her in ways that she couldn't imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesn't have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. I've also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I don't want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice?",2

It's slowly gotten to the point where I drink, I'd say, an average of two 25oz beers at 5-6% abv per night. Sometimes more and sometimes less, but that's pretty standard for me. For a while I was drinking liquor every night but I eventually forced myself to quit liquor. I was at probably about a half pint a day.

I'm not sure if my habit qualifies as ""severe"" or not, I think it's more like ""moderate"", but I haven't talked to many other people who have been or are alcoholics, so I have no way to really know. 

Anyways, I've recently realized and accepted that I have a problem and I know that it will just keep getting worse with time. I know that I'm at a point where I have to make choices. This habit will continue to get worse if I don't do something about it now. It's not over the top, fifth a day yet. But I know I could someday get to that point and I really don't want to. Alcoholism runs in my family. 

I've been trying to wean myself down to light beer, and I want to get down to one light beer a day before I start staying sober every other day. I'd like to get down to weekend drinking and then hopefully drinking even less. 

For a while I was thinking about going cold turkey but I realized there was a potential of withdrawal. That being said I have no idea if I drink enough to experience bad withdrawals. I can't remember the last night I was sober in 2 years.

I have blacked out more times than I can count. My mother was 18 when she had me, I am now 20. My father was an alcoholic, and my mom was always unstable, her emotions have always been up and down and scattered. Anyways... here I am 20... 2 years into college but I feel like I have a drinking problem? My mom and dad never married, mom re-married, new kids and hates my dad. I still talk to my dad because I feel pity for him and know he's a good person, just had a bad upbringing. Whenever I am intoxicated, I always think about the garbage can full of beer cans my dad would have. It was always budwiesier, whenever I see a glass or can of budwiesier I think of him. my dad would have these whenever I would go visit him. One new years, when he got so drunk he threw up all over himself, I was around 10, and gave him a pot and towel to throw up in/on. I never want to discuss this when sober, I put it in my subconscious mind, and almost forget about it. I never told my mom or friends/family about this. I know it will always be with me, and I would like to figure out a way to solve these feelings. I think these subconscious thoughts have effected my self esteem, and my overall view of myself. I really don't know how to deal with this.

tldr; my family was broken before I was born and I feel like i'm just following dads footsteps",2

Is it strange to want to hide it?,"The title may be a little confusing.  I hit 34 days sober for the first time in a REALLY long time.  I decided to stop drinking because i started to have really bad anxiety attacks out of nowhere in which i always felt like I was dying.  It terrified me so much that I decided that I needed to eliminate what in my mind appeared to be the source.  

I struggled with my drinking for a really long time, it was always beer, usually 40oz mickeys.  I could down 2 or 3 of them in one night , every night and wake up the next day and go to work like nothing.  I tend to excessively drink to self medicate, or when i am really stressed.  

Anyway, this is not the first time in which i have tried to stop, and in the past, i would always share with everyone how i have hit milestones,  5 days sober, 10 days, 15 days, and so on.  And every time it always just stopped.  Stopped of course because i had started up drinking again so I would reset.  

This time for me feels very different.  I feel like i dont want to share my milestones,  its not that i am afraid of relapse, which is always in the back of my mind of course, but its more of like.... people not really believing me.  I suppose. 

My father, is a dependency counselor and works with veterans, so he is very familiar with recovery and how the process is.  He has been there for me and talked me through it but as you know its hard for him to ""help"" since he is so close in my life.  My question is, is this normal to feel this way?  To want to keep my sobriety to myself?  Is that a healthy way to recover?",3

My dad (age 50) used to drink every night but has got better and now only drinks every Wednesday (has about 4 beers maximum), Friday (has probably around 6-8 and gets drunk) and Saturday (has 6-8 and gets drunk). I really don’t know how bad this is as my parents have always drank.

I'm on probation for a DUI and as a result have to do random ETG test. I ended up drinking 9 vodkas  last Friday and tested Wednesday evening; roughly 118 hours after my last drink. Or 108 hours after being sober. I'm highly active, drink 1 gallon of water a day and take creatinine. Prior to this I have not drank for 2 months. I've read the 80 hour test is really not 80 hours, and you're usually clean within 60 hours. Being I tested at 108 hours, I should be 100% clean correct? 

Anyone that had to take these have advice? Has anyone ever failed a ETG test after 80+ hours clean? I have some at home drug tests and I took 3. I passed all 3. When I gave my sample I made sure that it wasn’t the first piss.",3

She has lost everything, multiple times, including her kid (now living with my other sister). She was homeless and basically couch surfing anywhere that would let her get drunk (or give her drugs). It was a bad situation that was just getting worse. My husband and I have offered multiple times to take her in and help her out, but she never took us up on the offer. We live hours away from our hometown area and where she's been living, so away from everything she's familiar with and the people/places/things that enable her. We figured if she ever got serious about recovery, she'd take us up on the offer.

A little over a month ago, just before Halloween, she called me and said she needed help. She needed to quit drinking and she needed to get away from that area, she was ready to take us up on our offer. We drove 3 hours (with our 7 month old) to pick her up. She was wasted. We fed her for the first time in days. She puked and puked and puked on the drive back. She told us when we made it home that she finally felt safe and she was certain she would have died if she didn't come with us.

She decided to go cold turkey and we helped her through withdrawal. Finally things were looking good. We had a good Halloween, we got her set up with some state assistance so she could get medical care etc. We got some of her stuff back so she had clothes and some important documents. Only like a laundry basket and a trash bag full of stuff. We looked into AA meetings in the area and at first she wasn't ready, then she insisted we find a beginner meeting when I'd suggest a meeting that was happening on a certain day but it was a closed meeting or big book meeting etc, then we drove by one of the meeting locations in town and she (and admittedly myself too) thought it looked too sketchy/in a bad part of town. She ended up getting a job waitressing, having not yet gone to any meetings but being sober about two weeks. I finally find a meeting that seems to meet her criteria, and we plan to go... She got home from work and was too tired. I haven't wanted to push too hard, and after that it hasn't come up again. That was a couple weeks ago.

The past month has seemed pretty good regardless. She watched our dog for us when we went out of town. We go grocery shopping together. She loves spending time with our daughter. She seems like herself again. But I have noticed a big absence of talking about what she's going through. Just carrying on like things are hunky dory. Again, haven't wanted to push or act like I'm her counselor... So I've been letting it be and waiting for her to be ready. 

This past week my husband and I have had our doubts about her sobriety. She'd walk to the mall and go shopping after work but be gone for a while, she'd act a little different here and there, I'd catch a whiff and not be certain if it was alcohol or if she'd just brushed or teeth or if it was her cigarettes (I know this sounds weird but it would just be a smell that seemed familiar to me and ""off"" but I couldn't place what it was)... He and I talked about relapse being part of recovery and expected it to be a possibility. We discussed how to handle it if it happened. We also discussed how best to approach her about our concerns, knowing that she lies often to hide her problems and alcohol use, also knowing we didn't want to be accusational or too confrontational. 

Her and I were working on some crafting stuff together, decided to do a last minute craft show this weekend, and... I could tell the stress was getting to her. We were working in close quarters and I caught a whiff and finally asked her outright if she'd had something to drink. She admitted she had a shot from a co-worker when she went in to pick up her check (much earlier in the day). He had a bottle in his pocket and offered it to her. She said it was the first time she was confronted with it and she was so stressed, she just didn't handle it well and accepted. I told her I'd had suspicions for the past week and asked if she'd been drinking. She said no. I asked if she had any alcohol in her possession, at the house, she said no. Even with it being a frank discussion and lack of anger or accusational tone, she gets super emotional. My husband has a good talk with her, and she divulges how stressed she's been and how overwhelmed and how badly she wants to get wasted. How lonely she's feeling being away from everyone. How much she needs to go to a meeting and start proper counseling. Pretty much, she finally opens up and admits she's been afraid to talk to us about how she's feeling and just acting like things are fine. I cancel the craft show to alleviate some stress and she says that she's immediately feeling better. She even comes and helps me decorate cookies later that night.

Yesterday (the following day) she sleeps a lot, doesn't come with me on errands, but does get up for work in the evening and gets herself ready and looking nice. She has a history of just not going to work when she starts to spiral, so this seemed like a good sign. Before I had left for errands we did talk about meetings again. We discussed online meetings, this forum, some podcasts, a book, and other resources that are available remotely so even if she feels tired or can't find a physical meeting that works for her right away, there are options. I know these things can't completely replace the face time with others in recovery, but she sounded interested and surprised by the information. Almost excited to check them out. 

Later that night (last night) she calls me and let's me know she had to work until close. I think she's going to ask for a ride home, but she says that she's going over to a co-workers house to hang out and watch a movie. She's mentioned this co-worker before. She lives near us and has a couple kids. Her Grandpa has given my sister a ride from work before when it was raining and we were out of town. I knew she had expressed missing her friends to my husband so I figured this might just be something she needs - some time with people other than us. She says she won't be out late.

This call was at 10pm. We headed to bed around 11:30pm. We talked a lot before falling asleep about the possibility of her coming home drunk. About us not believing she's really watching a movie with this girl from work. About how we are going to handle it. I have a sick feeling in my stomach that I've had so many times with her when she drops off the radar and goes on a bender.... I wake up at 3:30am and she's still not home. I send her a text and then decide to call at 4am. Her phone is off and goes straight to voicemail.

So it's 5:50am. My husband is preparing to go to work.. I'm here with my baby and I just... I don't know what to do. How do I approach this? Bags packed and at the door and say either you go to a meeting today or you're out? Do I just drive her to a meeting? Do I gauge it based on how she shows up? My husband doesn't want me to do anything until he's home (she can be a violent belligerent drunk)... I see his point. We both truly want to help her and don't want to be too tough love too soon and stop her recovery in it's tracks... But we also seriously need to lay down some ground rules. 

Any input would be so very helpful. Maybe something that helped you or someone you love. Thank you in advance! 

TL;DR - sister has been staying with us and supposed to be working on recovery. She recently relapsed and now she has been gone all night. My husband has to work today and I'm home alone with our baby, so I'm just not sure how to handle this when (if?) she gets home. Need to set some serious boundaries/ground rules for if she's staying here but don't want to stop her recovery or send her back to a worse situation.",14

He is currently going through a DUI and possible jail time for 6 months soon after improving from not being in jail for awhile now. I am 23 year old female and he wasn’t around me growing up much, but now I am more aware of what happens to him because we talk a lot more now.

All I said was if he visits his dad (my grandpa) to not show up shit faced once I give him the new addres (I didn’t mean it in a bad way) and then he gets super raging mad on the phone after this moment of silence (I’ve never heard him talk to me so angry before) he says, “You know why I get shit faced, because you’ve never been to Vietnam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” (Hes also a Marine Vet with PTSD and other mental issues) I didn’t know he would react like that, idk if he’s drunk or what on the other side of the phone cause he sounded sober. In a way I’m just like wtf (lol), but then I’m so stressed out in life right now I hung up after telling him I’m just looking out for his dumb ass to not get kicked out of the old people home and starting crying to myself a bit. Also my family doesn’t want my dad to know where my grandpa is living which makes this situation even more sad and depressing and it’s so wrong cause my dad wants to see his dad so bad, but he got kicked out from visiting last time. I know where his new place is it’s in my notes somewhere on my phone. And then my family would kill me if they found out I told him his new address again. It’s all such a fucked up situation.

I feel so weird like wtf did I just do I feel so bad, he’s so mad at me. I feel like I triggered him and gave him a flash back or he’s just guilty cause he knows he has this addiction. Now I’m just thinking I need to be careful what I say around him. I know he needs to cool down, but I feel like he will never talk to me again. I’m so depressed.",1

I have been binge drinking on weekends for about two years and this year I've been drinking a lot on weekdays. Usually 355ml of vodka or tequila a night. Sometimes I won't be tired enough even after that and go out to a bar and have a few beers on top of that.

I did this last night and when I got home I was starving (didn't have dinner, just booze) and ordered Uber eats (this was just after midnight). I woke up in bed around 3 am and realized I missed the delivery. No refund (haha).

That's just a typical dumb episode of what happens when I drink.

I managed to go 2 months sober this year. I started on Sept 9th. No particular reason I think I had another dumb episode and just said enough was enough. I ended up making it all through October as a personal challenge and because I had heard about sober October.

About 2 weeks ago, I think on November 16th I was bored. Think it was a Saturday and I also felt anxious for some reason. I thought I could just have a couple beers plus hey it's Saturday.

Well that ended up just being a slippery slope and here I am in December back to 355ml bottles.

I know I have a problem but I'm not a religious person and I've heard thats a big part of AA and that's the main reason I haven't gone... plus I just feel very vulnerable/ashamed. I could be totally wrong about the religion thing though.

Anyways... I noticed during those two months I slept so much better. Better than I've slept in years and my BM's were fucking prestige (sorry for the details). Now they are going back to being watery/undigested food and just hard to pass.

I also noticed when I stopped drinking my nails started turning more pink. The thing that freaked me out today was that they've gone back to having this big white crescent moon shape in the middle. I've been googling it and the results all sound bad.

Have I permanently damaged my liver??

I have other symptoms too... Like I can't sleep again unless I drink before bed then in the morning I don't feel rested at all.

It took me days to get over this the first time. I think I had insomnia for 5 days last time. I feel so stupid putting myself back in this position. Its going to be a very LONG work week if I stop drinking but I'm also really worried about my health.

I've heard tapering off can help with withdrawal symptoms but I don't think I'm strong enough to have a few sips.

Anyways, reading this subreddit has been helping a bit, I can relate to a lot of the drunk stories. So as a side note, I'd like to thank some of you for sharing your experiences.",3
2019-12-06 17:10:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e75es6/for_my_mom/,For my mom,"Mom,

I never thought I'd be writing this. For years I saw you as a disappointment. A women who lost control of herself and found it in a bottle. For years I believed you replaced me with that bottle. I hated you. You hated me. I lost you around the age of 8. You were never the same. You remembered nothing and spoke unkindness toward me. You drank at all hours, at all times. It still shocks me how you were able to keep a job. My father, your husband did nothing to help you. He let you drown yourself, that's not love. My sister and I were so angry and hurt, we became vile with our words and actions. We didn't know how to love. I never knew how to help you - I was in too much pain. I never knew what to do to help you stop drinking... I'm sorry that I yelled at you. I'm sorry that we hurt each other. So much pain has been transferred in this family. We have caused each other so much suffering in the past.

Sept 2018 I began changing my ways. No more yelling, no more screaming. Just love and compassion. We had never tried this method before. Let's be honest, our family was not the type to dish out unconditional love. We all were defensive with one another. Maybe that's why we all ran from one another. I hid with insecurities and comedy. My sister with food and makeup. Dad with lies and work. You hid with a bottle. We ganged up on you. Your vice was the most overt. I'm sorry we took our shit out on you when you were hurting just as much.

I started loving you. Unconditionally. And that's when everything changed. You started opening up more, little by little. You kept drinking, but you were waking up. You started telling me things that you have never told me about your childhood. I didn't know about your sexual abuse. I didn't know how you grew up feeling betrayed and scared. I'm sorry. I love you.

My unconditional love and understanding was not enough. I knew your soul was suffering, but you were still gripped by immense pain - you couldn't let go of the bottle. It wasn't until that fateful day in June when we almost lost everything - you woke up. Your ego needed to be shook to the core for the message to truly sink in. We talked about spirit, trauma, and pain. We both understood that pain drove the drinking. Not disease. Of course not everyone may agree with this, but hey - this is for you, not them.

Mom, almost one year ago you quit drinking and haven't touched a drop since. 

You are 56 and you have begun a new life again. You have started all over and I cannot express how proud I am of you. I still cry thinking about it. Every day I see you, I see the light come back into you. It was not easy at first. Lord knows we were all on edge. The pain of the past was coming back, fierce and formidable. You stayed strong. Of course we all slip and get nasty, but we always come back learning from it. You started working out. You started praying. You started doing things for yourself you have never done before. I'm not saying everyday is a cakewalk, but shit - you have certainly become my inspiration.

We cry together now. We hold each other and share love through each other's embrace because we know what it feels like to be in the dark, scared. I see myself in you, and you see yourself in me. We mirror one another.

The other day you cried because you said how you wished to go back to my childhood years and start all over. I cried with you. Not because I lost my childhood. I already forgave that. But because now we have a lifetime to make beautiful memories together. We have talked so much about all of this, I know you know everything I'm writing. 

Mom, you're my hero. You are the strongest woman I have ever met. You personify resilience and emanate love. We don't expect perfection from one another, just love. Unconditional love. Who knew that was the cure to it all? If you told the family two years ago that unconditional love and understanding would save your life, we would have laughed. Now, I can't see living in a family without it. 

I'm 24 now. I got my mom back. I got my family back. Day by day we open up more and more. 

'Can't have rainbows without rain' 

I love you to the moon and back Mom.

I'll try to give a brief background. My partner and I have been together for 4 years, lived together for 3. We moved several states away from where we are from and where our family is about 2 .5 years ago. About 6 months into being out here my partner told me he wants to quit drinking because his dad is an alcoholic and I agreed. The last 2 years I've been under the impression he hasnt had any alcohol until last night, when I called him out for slurring his speech and he revealed he's been hiding alcohol from me, initially drinking once every few months at first, the 
about once a week after I go to bed, but recently it's become a few times a week.

 I feel so confused. He says he didn't wanna dissapoint me, but I never asked him to quit drinking in the first place. I didn't realize the level of drinking was a problem. He says he's an alcoholic and I feel so stupid for missing it this whole time but he's never given me any indication of being intoxicated, or missed work,or anything. He's always been an amazing partner to me and never shrugged off his responsibilities or let me down when it comes to a commitment, but I still feel incredibly hurt that he's been hiding this secret for years. I thought we had an open and honest relationship. He says everything else has been true this is the only secret. I guess I'm just looking for anyone who can relate or tell me your story. I don't know, I just feeling so lost and alone",2

I see I have a developing Alcohol Use Disorder. Because I started drinking more in the last 3 years and substituted alcohol for weed. I have had a deeper addiction with cannabis and quit 18 days ago. However I do not crave weed, I think about having 1 or 2 drinks. I had been drinking almost every day. I have been in a relationship with a heavy drinker, can't seem to quit that either so just don't see one another. Its not going to last because I am unhappy with a compulsive drinker and now I have become one myself so I am quit. This is very hard to post.
Has anyone felt depressed and unmotivated to the point they can not take actions? My bad habits and unhealthy activities have trashed my life.  I can't find my drive to better my life anymore.

drank 1.5-2 bottles of vodka a day after 5 years sober. my drinking pattern since relapsing was:

drank 3 weeks, sober for 3 weeks

drank 1 week, sober for 4 weeks

drank 1 week, sober for 1 week

drank 1 week, sober for 1.5 months

drank 3 days, sober for 1.5 months

&#x200B;

when drinking i was basically in a constant blackout.

i had alcoholic neuropathy in my fingertips and left foot and right toes. parts of my left foot literally had no feeling, i was terrified that i did permanent nerve damage

in the sober periods of 1.5 months i rigidly did a series of things to combat the neuropathy, in order of what i believe to be important:

&#x200B;

\* not drinking (probably the single most important...)

&#x200B;

\* eating proper food 3x a day (avocado, vegetables, meat)

&#x200B;

\* hydration throughout the day (water)

&#x200B;

\* vitamins: 1000mg lipoic acid, niacin, thiamin, b12, folic acid, magnesium, vitamin c, NAD, multivitamin

&#x200B;

\* walking every day, running every other day, training hand-grip

&#x200B;

Even with the 3-day relapse in the past 3 months I was able to reverse 90% of the alcoholic neuropathy. i have full feeling in my feet and toes and fingers. the only problem remaining is slight pain in the fingers and feet which pops up now and then like arthritis type pain. in the beginning i had slight trouble walking and could not really type on a computer because of the neuropathy, now i run for half an hour and type all day without issue.

Hope this post is of help to others who have neuropathy and are scared it never goes away. my experience shows that in a matter of months it can be significantly reversed. keep in mind that I stopped drinking within a week of first experiencing neuropathy (with notable relapses), in my research i have found that those who have had neuropathy for extended periods of time and kept drinking are the hardest cases to reverse.",8

She wants to take control and she is so much stronger than this disease. How can I support her and make sure she feels that she isn't alone? We can't see each other often, and I don't know what to do. Most of her friends drink frequently, and a big part of starting NA was to meet sober friends.

I just love her so much and believe in her more than she could ever know. Besides reminding her of that over and over, what can I do to help?",2

He did for 10 years and then relapsed hard. Like some fucked up coincidence,  my mother drove straight into the bottle a little after my dad.

Things have gotten better since my aunt and myself have been supporting them both to getting help and cleaning themselves up to act like proper parents for my siblings.

It's never been on my mind to get help myself for dealing with the emotional turmoil of my parents since young. I already had previously gone to therapy for personal traumas but the subject of my families relationship with alcohol never seemed like an issue.

However recently my mother brought up going to support groups for family members or friends of alcoholics and insisting that I go. I first brushed it off cause alcoholism is so engrained in my family tree, we were a cake walk compared to the absolute destructive abuse my cousins had to deal with. Now I'm second guessing myself.

*Has my parents recent fallout really affected me that much that even my mother has been insisting harder than she does when it comes to my depression? Or has it been snowballing and now my current behavior has been raising red flags to everyone but me?*

It really fucked me up for a couple of days. I'm already very careful considering my past self-destructive acts dealing with depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies, so this was a huge shock to my system.

So now I'm already got in contact with the local AA to see if any groups meet up on my days off. To my great relief and terror, I'll be going to one in a couple of days. Which *yay* but now that adds to my lists of traumas I have to deal with.",1

Usually I buy just two of the Foster's oil cans (each about 25 oz, if I remember correctly), drink them on the back porch over the course of 90ish minutes, and then consider myself done for the night. I've found that it gets me intoxicated enough to unwind my body and dull my body's soreness (I'm 6'6"", 248 lbs), but not enough to have unpleasant side effects the following morning. I also drink at least 20 oz of water to make sure there's no hangover. When I don't buy Foster's, I tend to have the equivalent of 3-5 drinks in one sitting of whatever I do have.

I have said that Im looking to have a relationship but he seems apprehensive, Im afraid to keep on the subject but am afraid Im falling in love alone.

He works 5 days a week then when free gets reallllllly loose with booze at local bars with his friends Friday night thru Sunday afternoon.

Hes a very nice guy. He seems insecure but sweet & has a hard time being comfortable with me(as I can see) but with each beer he gets more open.

On 3-5 occasions he's been real deep in the booze & professes his love for me. He says Im what he wants, he loves me and that he wants to marry me. He asks me to say it back but the timing isnt real (I want it to be) Its wonderful & I want to say it back but I dont...drunk or not.

I tell him my feelings & say Id love him to be so honest when he's sober. I know that if he was & said what he does when hes drunk I would say it back

HOWEVER...when sober he recalls nothing (or so he says) & also apologises (which makes me a little sad) Its VERY hard for me, a girl interested in growing with him, to get, literally 2 different guys

As much as his binge drinking hurts him and makes me worry, he is the guy I like drunk & I wonder where that man goes sober.

He's a great person and works hard, he has a good job and is very empathetic towards others, but has a habit of bottling his problems and emotions up and not talking about them.

My dad used to have an alcohol problem, I barely remember it because I was a young child and he sorted it out before I was old enough to realise. The only memory I have is him taking my sister and I out for walks along the beach, and then we would go into the ""lemonade bar"" as we called it, my sister and I would get lemonades and my dad would get a few pints.

My mum recently told me that his problem was bad over a decade ago, it prevented my parents going out socialising (In Britain people go to the pub for a drink with friends...) because he would get pissed while their friends would only have a couple of drinks. He drove while drunk and wrecked a car drink driving around that time. He would drive with us as kids while drunk. In the end my mum put her foot down and insisted he stop, which he did.

About a year or two back he started going on business trips to China and around the same time one of his beloved coworkers died in a workplace accident. This was also in close proximity to his mother passing away. In Chinese business culture drinking is mandatory, and he thought he could handle it, but he couldn't. We think the drinking problem has re-emerged.

We've found almost-finished rum bottles in his work backpack, and my mum suspects he sneaks out of the house to drink at night.

What's worse is that recently he has been diagnosed with early diabetes, and it can be hard to tell the difference between symptoms of low blood sugars or him being drunk. I doubt the alcohol is doing any help for his diabetes.

We're worried for him but don't know what to do to support him. My sister and I are away at University, so it's only my mum at home with him which makes it difficult to properly police his behaviour.

Do you know what we can do to help?",2

But I’d love to hear some advice from people that actually can understand from my gfs perspective because I’m not an addict myself. 

So my gf is an addict and has been for years. Right now she’s been drinking a lot. She drinks more than a half a fifth a night and she’s only 5’2 and weighs 118lbs. Her drinking has gotten to a point where it’s effecting our relationship in a very bad way (mentally abusing me). To the point where I’m about to leave. My life has been hell recently... and all I want to do is talk about it with someone. So, when I went out with some friends the other night they asked how me and my gf were doing. I took this opportunity to tell them about how my gf is drinking a lot and it’s making me very depressed and uncomfortable. They were very supportive and didn’t judge my gf at all because they know I love her and they are overall really good understanding people. 

Well fast forward a couple days later, my gf came up to me and told me she’s going to go detox in a hospital for a week. I was very excited to here this and was very supportive of her decision. Since she would be gone for a week I’d be alone in our apartment and I haven’t been away from my gf for more than 1 night for the past two years that we have been dating. So I took this opportunity to ask if my friends would come over to keep me company by telling them my gf is getting help. They responded by saying they were very happy to hear she was getting help too. 

So, my gf thinks everyone is out to get her... so I tried cheering her up by letting her know a lot of people care about her, including my friends. She asked me why would my friends care about her and I informed her I told them about our situation we are having and how they were happy she’s making the choice to better herself. She then proceeded to get very mad at me for telling them “her business”. 

I understand for the most part why she would feel that way because she feels probably feels embarrassed about it. But she doesn’t seem to understand that it’s effecting me a lot too and it’s nice to talk about my problems with people I trust. She would rather I lie to them and just say we are having problems and leave it at that. I’ve been with her for a couple years now and I have a pretty good understanding of how an addicts brain works. So I can understand why she can’t see how it’s effecting people around her unless she hits her rock bottom (which she has). But she still doesn’t seem to understand that I need to talk to people about it. 

I feel as though it’s gotten to a point where it’s now my problems too especially if she’s abusing me. I did set up an appointment with a counselor to talk about these problems also so there’s that. But should she really be that mad at me for sharing what I’m going through with my friends?",0

When I think of in-patient rehab, all I  do is worry that it will bankrupt me and keep me from finding another job. I agree with my therapist that I need to stop the downward spiral and just focus on myself - but the idea of being away from my family for the holidays - bills not getting paid, etc. terrifies me.

2019-12-04 07:36:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e5ylso/fed_up/,Fed Up,"Alcohol,

We met when I was a young age. Both my dad and mom hung out with you a lot while I was a kid. You were just for adults, and school taught me how dangerous you were, so I vowed to never consume you. 

In my mid teens though, you began to grow on me. You started hanging out with my friends, and made them hilarious. My friends told me you're not as bad as we all thought, and that I should try hanging out with you. Our first hang out session was magical. You were the social lubricant I was missing all my life; I went from an uptight, quiet, dork to a hilarious, outgoing, goofy guy in one night. 

Hangovers? What the hell are hangovers? We never got hungover at this age, just another lie our teachers had told us in school about you. Drinking at parties and with other people is fine, it's only drinking alone that is worrisome. It's only if it affects your life in a negative way, and there was no negative affects here. I had the guts to talk to girls, and they found me funny and interesting. I could become the center of attention and tell everybody stories again, something I had lost during puberty when I began to experience bad anxiety. You know what? I felt like you were curing my anxiety. You were so cool. 

Once I hit 21, there was so many variations of you to try. So many fancy looking liquor bottles and endless options of beer flavors to share with my friends. Advertising really started to affect my decisions. I noticed in movies and shows sometimes the really suave businessmen would pour whiskey during a meeting at work or have a couple nips on the road. Programmers (I'm a computer science graduate) in movies would sit down and have a couple beers as they coded up ingenious solutions. People who drank in commercials always looked like models and social butterflies. I wanted to do it all. This only solidified my suspicions; you weren't so bad after all. 

It was weird, though. When I would hang out with you while trying to be productive, I'd get almost nothing done and at half the pace. I had forgotten that it was supposedly troublesome to hang out with you alone, or first thing in the morning, but you had grown on me so much it felt like the next logical step. My friends would make remarks about it, because I'd always be hanging with you alone while we played games over Skype. I didn't give it much thought, though. They didn't understand that it was just helping me with anxiety and to ease my mind. 

I've always been really bad at moderation, I guess I have an addictive personality, but that was never really the focus of anything I learned in school. All I really knew was you were supposedly really bad for me just hangovers are bad, and alcohol will rot my liver. I didn't experience hangovers still, and if my liver was rotting, I couldn't tell. My moderation issues showcased themselves with you though, because I began regularly going way past my limits. Years went by where I didn't remember falling asleep, because we would black out together. I still never had hangovers though, so it couldn't really be that bad right? Despite what people had told me, despite hanging with you all the time, I managed to maintain my friends and I landed an excellent paying job. I also was in a multiple year relationship and life felt good. They never covered this stuff in my school experience, and I figured I just knew better than I had been taught. 

But years kept going by in a blur. I balded earlier than my friends. Maybe that's shitty genes, maybe it was you, or a combination, but it affected me and weighed on my self image. You could fix that though, a few hours with you and I wouldn't think about it any more. I think that's how a lot of the changes I noticed would be rationalized in my head. They could all be explained with bad genes too, right? I also got really big bags under my eyes. My memory became awful. My skin was really dry a lot of the time. My circulation got so bad that a new girlfriend commented on how it was so strange that parts of my body felt hot but other parts very cold. I developed a really big belly. I developed gastrointestinal problems. Hangovers started to be a thing and I'd wake up always feeling dehydrated. I wasted so much money. I wasted so much time. I ruined relationships. I stopped calling people back. My work suffered. Things spiraled out of control over the course of years but I was so drunk most of the time it felt like just months. I don't remember a lot of it anyway. I tried to get you out of my life so many times but like an abusive relationship, I kept coming back. 

You're everywhere. You're in ads on the street, online, on the TV. You're immediately offered to me at restaurants, you're strewn about every grocery store. You're the focus at family and friend gatherings. You're still in all the movies and shows, being portrayed in all the wrong ways the majority of the time. You're an incredibly profitable, addictive entity that is thriving, but you're killing me. 

Even though you're everywhere, I'm done with you. This is my third day straight without you, and I won't consume you again deliberately. I now know why I was warned against using you, just worded in too simplistic terms that I never fully understood or respected. You really suck, and I wish I never met you. 

Fuck you, alcohol.",31

Been drinking at LEAST 10 drinks a night for 2 years on and off and have had a problem for 4 years. Over the last year I haven’t slept sober a single day.

I usually only drink to fall asleep so this is important because when I wake up I usually don’t eat until mid day. But recently over the last 3 days I’ve needed to force feed myself so I don’t die of malnourishment. I have no appetite. Zero. Never hungry. 

Anyone know what this means? I also have liver pains for sure and possibly jaundiced eyes I can’t tell.

Read up and it looks like the loss of appetite is a symptom of alcoholic liver disease but I can’t verify this. Maybe something else is wrong with me?

How fucked am I, what should I do besides quit?

Anyone experience anything like this before?",1

After being awake for awhile I started sweating terribly, hands shaking like a leaf, no appetite and nausea, with some pretty terrible anxiety. 

Did some searching and found alcohol withdrawal as most likely, had a beer and a bit of rum and what do you know the symptoms went away.

I knew I drank a lot and was definable as an alcoholic. Cognitively I knew this, but didn't believe that was really me. (classic denial I know) But now this is me admitting I have a problem. I am a high functioning alcoholic.

Admitting it is the first step to fixing it right? So now I'm trying to figure out how I need to taper off. Last week I went through 4.5 liters of rum, it's the most I've ever drank in a week, ever. In the months previous a 1.75 a week wasn't uncommon.

I'm disappointed in myself for letting it slide like this. I'm scared of dealing with these withdrawal symptoms. I'm scared of confronting the feelings I've been trying to numb.",14

I want to exercise today.,"So last night I messed up and drank for the first time in a month(still a nice accomplishment in my book). This morning I recommitted to swearing off alcohol forever. 

I have been on an exercise routine that's 5-6 days a week, and obviously yesterday it didn't happen since I was shit faced from about 4 in the afternoon until 11 at night. I think I ended up only drinking 10 though? Hard to remember exactly but I think it was 8 long island ice teas, and 2 pints of beer(one coffee porter and one pineapple something). I did break my oath at like 2pm with half a bottle of wine that I estimated was about 3 drinks. So 13 on the day? Probably 2 that I can't remember so lets say 15.   


So yeah it was not a good deal drinking that much alcohol. I came home and totally knocked out on my bed. This morning I felt like dogshit. I'm 28 male weigh 225 lbs and very muscular so my body can actually handle alcohol relatively well. So I don't have the worst hangover, like i have no headache, was pretty dehydrated when I woke in the night so I drank a bunch of water. Then I had 2 bowls of ramen noodles this morning. Logic was the salt in the broth should help. I'm starting to feel normal again.  


The plan was a light hour or so of lifting, and then a 10k run. But I don't know if it is safe for me since I got fucked up yesterday and my body is probably not fully recovered.   


Any tips on this subject? As far as safety and the efficacy of a workout today is concerned?",2

I'd brush off the horrific things you and I would do together, or just try to ignore them like it didn't matter.

I hear you in songs I listen to, I see you with everyone I know, you are everywhere. Your friends with just about everyone in my life and I know I will never be rid of you. The thought of never consuming you again is daunting and hard, while the thought of being consumed by you is terrifying yet easy. You'd be so easy to just let win, but I'm kinda stubborn. 

I must remind myself consistently of why you are no good for me. Not let myself be fooled into thinking it can be different. Because I truly know it cannot. It's not just you, alcohol, that I have this problem with. There is no misunderstanding of my insatiable hunger for more. It's never enough for me when I give in.

New here, I came looking for some help and support. I’ve been drinking on a daily basis for as long as I can remember. I think it’s not interfering with my professional life, I only drink in the evening and not until I am shitfaced blackout drunk. That never happens actually. I do empty one to one and a half bottles of wine between 17:00 and 23:30, of 6-8 beers. So I think I classify as an alcoholic tbh. 

Lately I have not been feeling well, ended up burned out and I am on sick leave as we speak. This has no direct relation to the drinking, the last 10 years a lot of bad shit has happened which took its toll. I am on the way back so that is a good thing. But this period has had me thinking about my life and my health. 

I used to be a party animal, big time. Booze, drugs, benders that lasted 3-4 days. This is long behind me and the drugs are, and never been, an issue. Haven’t touched the shit for over a year and I really and honestly don’t miss it. It was recreational on the weekends and never involving needles or shit. 

Back to the alcohol, my entire professional life I was working in hospitality. Events, restaurants, clubs and bars. Owning a bar restaurant as well. So very close to alcohol for as long as I remember. And everyone who ever worked in the industry knows how end of shift works...

Ok, this is getting a long ass post. Sorry, I hope by the end one or two of you are still with me!

Back to the title. Lately I have been thinking it would be very good for me to quit drinking for at least one whole month. Just to see what will happen to me, my body and most importantly, my mind! I just can’t seem to make it work. I’ve reached two weeks without one drop. The main issue, besides me being a little weak, are my surroundings. Literally EVERYONE around me drinks. Including my lovely SO. And without it being peer pressure, they make it very hard for me to quit. I spoke about it to my SO and my friends and family, but I don’t feel like they completely understand what I am trying to do and how serious this is for me. 

We have dinners, birthdays, casual fridays, national holidays, barbecue parties and on and on. Weekly. 

I found that when I am alone, at home, no drinking, no problem. But as soon as my SO is here (we are not living together) or I step foot outside, bam. Alcohol. 

I have spoken about this to my SO, which this is not about, she has her own story and I will not discuss here. Short version is I do not feel properly supported by anyone around me in helping me not to drink. It is taken lightly, and swept under the table. 

What I would like to know, does anyone recognize this and how did you break through the normality that is alcohol in so many lifes around you? Looking forward to your reactions, tips and stories. Thanks for bearing with me to anyone who read this whole.",7

I hope this is the place for those two things. 

A bit on me. I am a collage student studying psychology and I am thinking about going into addiction therapy when I get to the masters level.

So I have lived with this family for 4 years now. For many years before I moved here the father of the family suffered from alcoholism. It has understandably been very rough for the family through out the years and in the past year or so it has gotten worse. He lost his job as the alcohol has really done a number on his body making it so that even when he is sober he has very poor fine and gross motor skills. He also has a nasty habit of just screaming from his room at his wife and children and sometimes (but lest often) me, to go buy him ciggerets or to get him food. 

Aside from alcoholism he suffers from some depression and some major anxiety and I believe that these definitely play a roll into his problem. He has tried AA before but never stuck with it and family cannot afford a therapist. He went to rehab for a bit but that was kinda the beginning of the end, because after being out of work and going through a traumatic detox he was never able to get back to work.

I am compassionate for this man. I have an interesting perspective in this situation as get a kinda fresh look at him, one not muddled by years of torment, a bit of a fly on the wall, and also the only man to man relation in this family+me situation. It had been this relationship that has given me the goal to go into addiction therapy and so I have started a journey to try to help this man as a bit of a test run for my therapeutic strategies.

And so I am here to ask you, people of Reddit who have been in his, or his families, or my situation. What has helped you? I want to know more of his mind set and what it is like to crave something so badly that nothing else seems to matter, at least from an outer perspective. If you wanted to PM me or comment on this post I would love to talk to anybody on this matter. 

My working theory and plan of action is based on a quote a professor once told me, “Our job is not to fix people, but simply to help them make decisions.”  That is kinda what I am going for. I can’t make him stop drinking, no one can, but him. I just want to try to figure out what spark of motivation might help him. 

I hope this hasn’t come off as insensitive in any way. And I look forward to any insite you have for me.",1
2019-12-02 20:14:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/e593pc/when_almost_20_years_of_fun_comes_crashing_down/,When Almost 20 Years Of Fun Comes Crashing Down,"Choosing to put pencil to paper here on Reddit because it is anonymous, I can send a link to those I wish to without explaining many times over, and because this forum has been a wealth of knowledge for me as I finally face my time of denial and admit to both myself and those closest to me that I am a struggling alcoholic mess - maybe it can help those in this forum as it has for me and maybe it will help others I know that are.

Warning.  This is probably going to be long and because I am on mobile with some errors (not to mention my mind is all over as I am going through withdrawal).

To preface, I am 36, and well educated on drugs and addiction, both from a psychological educational perspective and from an associative one.  Never hard drugs myself, but I’ve been around them from adolescence until even now, but have had really close loved ones affected majorly by drugs and alcohol - drugs more than alcohol, which is important, I vowed to never use hard drugs at a young age, but not alcohol, which of course is taught, but always disregarded - it is very much just as life impacting as hard drugs.

I am not atypical of the average thirty something today.  Drank some in High School but went to college and drank like crazy - binge drank, hard, most days of the week.  I worked, was on top of my studies, it was not affecting me negatively other than regular hangovers, so all was good.  But really it wasn’t.  It was the start of a behavior and hobby really that remained.  Drinking heavy, way more than any definition of binge drinking (5 haha), was my every weekend, most weeknight, and was all things social, all the time.

Work was no different.  Early career was like college parties after work.  Current career is an industry where completely accepted that you work hard to drink later (often lunch too).  To top it off, I am in sales, so I’m the one taking people out and entertaining - which is essentially go drink!

Close to twenty years.  Hard, heavy, and regular drinking - no DUI’s, no missed work goals, good salary etc.  Life is good, until something changes.  

Three years ago or so.  Attention got off, motivation lessened, took low dose adderall, which only prolonged my current.  You drink a shit ton more and have the stamina to stay up longer to do it which means both day and night drinking.  The adderall became just that though.  Used more for edging the tiredness brought on by alcohol.  Low dose is all it took, not regularly and not often, unless a huge party or event, that mix, heavy adderall and alcohol proved to make me completely stupid doing regrettable shit with little memory of it.

Looking back though, just about every really stupid or regrettable thing I have ever done, alcohol was involved.  

This is all hindsight looking back, as much as I knew better, I was nowhere near recognizing shit to even be in denial then.

Over the last two years it was much of the same.  I would not go out of my way necessarily to hide the amount of drinking I was doing, but beers disappeared quick.  Suddenly 12 packs were being refilled with 6 packs as to make them appear to last longer than they really were.  In the last year everything I did usually involved me with a beer in hand.  Lunch drinking became normal (work close to home).  A year ago I may have one or two every now and again at lunch but the last six months it wasn’t uncommon to do most days.  If it made me tired I would pop a little adderall at the office and do probably half shitty but volume loads of work.

Then bam.  It all falls apart.  Anxiety. Depression.  How do you cope?  Alcohol of course.  But at this point it doesn’t work like it did.  It works but with lesser affect and intensely stronger feelings of anxiousness and depressed mood.  Your brain becomes shot.  You can literally feel the neurons in your brain scattering.  Your blood pressure goes through the roof.  You feel faint.  You feel like you are dying.

Was defeat admitted?  Of course not. Still in denial.  I went to doctors (regular/urgent/er) explaining symptoms.  They all ask about your drinking but you twist it to seem like it’s not as much as it really is.  You go broke with them running tests that show you are perfectly fine (other than hormones are low from you guessed it - drinking).

For me, I knew I needed to throw in the towel a few weeks ago.  Hit a point of probably clinical inpatient type shit in my mind.  Still am there but am going to turn this shit around.  I have one shot and I know it.  

It is going to be a long road and alcohol withdrawal is total hell.  Choosing to do it without benzos.  Never messed with those and I am sure they would help, but not looking for another potential dependency on something.  12 step and AA might work for some, but I seriously do not see that for me.  I may go see someone, I do not know yet.  I know what I need to do, which is stop period, get a few new hobbies, and concentrate on the next half of my life.",6

And I’m scared.,"I don’t know what to do. She drove home really drunk today. So drunk that she stumbled into the house and then almost fell going up the stairs. My dad yelled at her and told her that she can’t keep doing this. He told me it’s been going on all this year. She went to her real estate closing today visibly drunk. It doesn’t help that she’s the #1 agent in the area. It gives the company a bad name and she’s going to end up getting fired, put in jail, kill someone, or herself.

I just found out she was driving drunk today when I saw her stumble out of her car. She’s been drinking, but she’s been hiding it from me after I called her out on it a few months ago. Only my dad knew about it. She’d stop for a day or two and then go back to drowning herself in alcohol. When I texted all of our family to try to get an intervention, they didn’t believe me. They were so shocked that she was like this. My grandmother thought I was joking her. We’re going to try to talk to her tomorrow. But I’m not scared if she’s going to be mad at me for telling all of our family. I don’t care if she’s mad. I need her to get help.

My biological dad is an alcoholic. I’ve been no contact with him for 3 years and haven’t seen him in 6. But he did the same things she’s doing now. I thought she moved on from him and saw what he did to her and me. She’s a great mom. But she’s doing what he did. And I can’t get over that. She’s hurting my step dad and me now. And it hurts. I don’t know what to do.

I have an English Comp class tomorrow at 11AM and I’m scared to go to classes because what if she goes and drinks while driving again? What if I never see her again? What if she gets arrested? What if she kills someone? What if she crashes? I’m going to write an Email to my professor telling her that I have a family emergency and then I’m going to force my mom to stay home. I’m going to be down in the living room so that she can’t go anywhere. I don’t trust her. She has the keys to my car so if she wanted, she could still take it. She also has her older car that she hasn’t sold. She has 3 different cars she could use. But I’m not going to let her. I’m tired of this. She was doing so well.

Should I stay home tomorrow and watch over her? My dad is going to work and my professor doesn’t use absences against our grade, so I’ll be fine. But I’m scared that she’ll go somewhere. I’m afraid she’ll start yelling at me and force herself to one of the cars. I have no way to move the cars so she can’t drive them. She has the Tesla app on her phone so she can just take one of the Tesla’s and not have any keys. I can’t take away her phone. I don’t know what to do. I need help. What are the next steps for this? I’m scared. I’m so young. I don’t want to lose her this early. I’m only 20. We all need help. She needs help. I love my mom too much to see her crumble after all of what’s happened to her. She’s so strong. I know she can get over this, but she isn’t listening to us. She won’t talk to me or my dad. She ignores us like we aren’t even here.",1

I've been thinking about my alcohol use for a while and trying to figure out if it's just use, or if it's abuse.. since I'm younger than the stereotype of an 'alcoholic' im not too sure what to think.. 

*For some context*
I'm a 22 year old irish trans guy (I live in australia), I also have diognosises of depression, anxiety and adhd. Geneticly, my Dad has had challenging experiences with alcohol in the past as well as the typical Irish family history of alcoholism.. lol

Since I was 14-16 I would have a few drinks here and there but once I turned 18 (legal drinking age in australia)  I feel as though I may have started going over board.

Because of my family history and my academic studies/experiences of addiction, mental health, trauma and vulnerability etc. 
I've gained a lot of knowledge around the subject- I'm worried that this has altered my idea of what it means to have an issue with alcohol.

So in the past, friends and partners have been frustrated with my drinking bc I would go 'over the top'. Now I'm reflecting on this wondering if it was the typical Australian binge drinking culture or if it was my own personal stuff. This is because im becoming slightly worried about my use of alcohol and how it's influencing my life.

Right now, or in the past few months, I've been drinking way more often, alone a lot more and not being able to limit myself when i go out with friends. My best guess is that I'm using it as a coping mechanism for my anxiety which is connected to my adhd and being transgender- but idk just a guess.

I'm not too sure what the purpose of my post here is, I think I'm just unsure about where to go for support when/if I need to- mostly due to the fact that younger people aren't often validated or supported when it comes to alcohol issues.

Any and all support, advice, feedback and criticism is welcome.",3

Recently their drinking has become very problematic. They still live at home, don't have a steady job, don't go out much and don't have a significant other. 
They routinely turn up to rehearsal drunk from the night before, and proceed to drink alcohol free beer during rehearsals.
They routinely stay up very late and have rambling monlogues on the band WhatsApp group, and then don't respond to messages until well into the next day.
I have had several heart to hearts with them over the years, and it now seems like that was in vain as they are back on the wagon, and caused a nasty argument on the band chat group, and has now advised they will leave the band following our next gig.

I'm at my wit's end, because I gave them so many second chances when others did not.
I still care a lot about them, but they do not seem to want help, and are content to not seek help, bit it's tearing the band apart now.

However that was months ago and for the past 3 or so months ive drank again every day or every other day at least 8oz a day and at most like 16. Im SO desperate to at least stay sober for 2 days in a row as a start but Im terrified of withdrawal. My doctor has given me klonopin and insists I havent been drinking heavy enough long enough to have severe withdrawal (Im 25 and have been drinking semi heavy to very heavy for about a year) now Im at the point where I cant even remember the last time I was sober 2 days straight. What do you all think? Should I try? Is my fear just me catastrophizing this whole thing? Ive gone as far as a day and a half sober with minor withdrawal symptoms  (some dizziness, fatigue, nausea, anxiety all pretty mild) but now I REALLY want to make that 2 day stretch as a start down a better road. If I go for it and manage to do it without caving Id definitely let you all know but what do you think??? Should I go for it?? Should I not be so afraid?",2

Not everyone finds an excuse to drink to excess every 2-3 months. In my old life, it seemed like something that was more or less inevitable. But now it just isn't. It's honestly just not the thing most people do -- and I didn't realize that until very recently. Kind of boggles the mind to realize this.",14

I felt desperate and mixed alcohol and psych meds and ended up in the psych ward again. I've never had another drink since but it is  only because of the program of alcoholics anonymous I haven't found it necessary to have to take a drink.

This past year has been the hardest in my sobriety. I lost my job in February, I watched a friend die of alcoholism at 36 who had gone back out after a doctor told her she would die. She died 33 days sober I said goodbye to her on a Thursday and on that Sunday, which was Easter Sunday my best friend died of a heart attack she never smoked or drank or used which had a family history of heart disease the following day Monday I was hospitalized with pneumonia and on oxygen got out the day of my grandpa's death anniversary and my girlfriend of 4 years left me two days later. That was just in April. Since then two more members of my home group have passed away, I thought being alone so hard after my girlfriend left me I married a guy who I dated for 5 weeks he turned out to be super possessive and controlling , he got super abusive and went back out we're now getting a divorce. I still don't have a job and I have a friend who helps me with bills. I've been to the Psych ward twice since July my life is a hot messssss! But I haven't had to drink over any of it! My program teaches me that I just don't drink NO MATTER WHAT!!

Working with other girls helps tremendously with my own sobriety. I don't know but I could have made it through this last year without them if I hadn't have had to have been accountable to them I don't know if I could have gotten out of my house or even out of bed. I have horrible anxiety that makes it hard to get out of my house sometimes but I just tell myself just do the next right thing gives me some sort of framework for the day and helps me stay moving forward when it feels impossible. I just finished training to be a recovery support specialist and I am going to start putting in resumes this week. I know if I just keep doing the next right thing, things won't feel so hard forever. I really understand whenever they say I wouldn't trade my worst day sober for my best day drunk.",34
