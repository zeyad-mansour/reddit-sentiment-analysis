Very much respect for every single person participating in here!!! (no matter your actions)

I was reading a bunch of your posts, comments and tips over the past hours and I truly have to ‚Äúpull my hat‚Äù (a popular German saying literally translated...) to  your actions, dedication and will to help each other no matter the color, race, gender or view. 

Keep on doing your best everyday mates!!!

This post is titled ‚Äúunusual‚Äù as I don‚Äôt really know if this is the right place to call for help but here we go anyway:

My coworker and meanwhile good mate seems to have a hard time suffering from alcohol abuse. 

To be honest he never admitted his problems in person to me or any of our other members (4-5 other people) in our little team at work but to be honest^2 I grew up under the harsh hand of my alcoholic father, which still haunts me today and ended up with me abusing weed (honest^3 actually siting on the balcony smoking weed right now ...) and I am able to see and understand the signs an alcohol abusing person shows and how he interacts while being sober/drunk. 

I meet him 2.5 years ago and we have seen each other 5 days a week on a regular basis over this time.

Had the strong feeling of him abusing alcohol right from the start but always accepted him as person and his work ethic. 

We are used to his alcohol breath which he tries to cover with eating a lot of menthol sweets over the day. His eyeballs are slightly yellow shadowed all the time. Skin insane red, almost from bulging texture, sweating even in winter season and trembling hands in the morning. He never eats any breakfast or lunch. Water and menthol sweets all day.....
Called him once after work and he mumbles any kind of words which I still don‚Äôt understand until today. 

Over the last two weeks his overall status went down real quick. Mistakes at work popped up, he never used to make any mistakes at all (from what I know), he seems unfocused and a little tippsy all the time and his alcohol breath increased. Seems to smell like hand sanitizer.......

The actual turning point and beginning of my helpless search for help was today morning!!! He sat at his desk vomiting in his mouth while trying to swallow it back down at the same moment!!!5 MINUTES!!!AND GUESS WHAT!!!That motherfucker made it without spilling a drop at his white polo or anywhere else!!!
Really close friend and other coworker on our way home came up with the point that such an ‚Äúamazing‚Äù performance wasn‚Äôt his first time for sure.....

I know his mom is in bad physical condition since about two weeks and his daily life is heavily affected by that (grocery shopping, cleaning, appointments at the doctors etc. ) and of course I know that his mom might be the reason he lost control over alcohol and his daily business/routine/life

My colleagues and I sat together today at lunch and came up with the plan to sent him on vacation for a week or two ( btw I have mixed feelings about him being alone at home...) and we offered to have a talk with him instead of our retarded boss. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem with having a serious talk or offering some broad shoulders if that helps but I don‚Äôt want to offend him about the topic alcohol or being an alcoholic ( he never committed being an alcoholic or having trouble with alcohol but it is an open secret somehow ) to be fair he knows that I smoke from time to time but I never committed any abuse or (particular heavy) daily use in front of him. 

Sorry if I took the wrong place to share a little cutout of my thoughts, concerns and worries but I have the strong feeling this spot might not be that wrong at all...

Thanks mates ‚úåüèª",3

I go to the gym, and afterwards I‚Äôll drive to the grocery store-I‚Äôll use my gym bag to smuggle booze into my house, so no one knows. 

I had a few good weeks, but when my parents went away I got and got a fifth of vodka. I was perpetually drunk for about four days, and I‚Äôve also developed the nasty habit of doing the same thing over the weekend.  Just drunk or brutally hungover...

But now my issues are escaping into my weekly life. If it‚Äôs available mid-afternoon I‚Äôll start drinking, drinking just for the hell of it- initially my problems started due to sleep. I gave myself permission to buy alcohol because of my sleep problems-but it‚Äôs a vicious cycle. After my binges I develop severe insomnia so then I go and drink more.

Instead of having two glasses of wine I began to down pint after pint of vodka. Last night I was confronted by this reality- I was like ‚Äúreally David are you gonna start having a pint of vodka or more every night? This will kill you.‚Äù

My room is a total mess. I feel like I‚Äôm slipping into something beyond my control. I‚Äôm afraid to fess up to my issues, my cousin is the star alcoholic in my family, and after all he went through, I still chose to go down this path? And once I come clean will I ever be able to drink ever again?

The never again part is too heavy. I used to have self-control, I just don‚Äôt know what happened. For years I drank fairly responsibly sure had a little too much sometimes 

Anyway I don‚Äôt know if anyone will read this. But I needed to tell someone, even if it‚Äôs a group of anonymous strangers...",1

My dad is a heavy binge drinker. Hes been drinking since i was born. He would say he is quitting and stop drinking for a while. Until he cant stand the withdrawal so he would start the cycle all over again. His mental and physical health is gradually getting worse and he even had to get a liver surgery at one point. He's starting to talk nonsense and get paranoid delusions when drunk. None of this has gotten him to stop drinking. He would have withdrawal and ""taper"" with a drink, just to get blackout drunk and end up drinking for 1 or 2 months straight. I tried all i can think of and im at the end of my ropes here. I asked him to seek medical help but he insists he can quit if he wants. Is there anything i can do",2

Knowing the danger of that I've tried to keep it in check. Measuring my booze intake with measuring cups for example or buying a Breathalyzer.

I have noticed recently that while binge drinking I make SCARY dumb choices.

Purchases I shouldn't make , leaving the freezer over, making meals with little regard for food safety, staying up till 4:30 am when I have work in the morning futilely trying to achieve orgasm, drunk texts....

At the moment I don't feel ""hung over"" but my stomach hurts something awful. Could be all the booze or the way I ate or  both.

After times that really scared me I tend to shut down intake for a week or so. Both for safety and to prove to myself I havent formed a dependancy.

Only once did I find a real issue with doing this and it was when I was using booze to treat my insomnia. That feeling went away after a while.

But I do recognize a wider issue with alcohol I have even if it isn't full on ""I need a drink a day""

Like a few years ago sober me was ""Xanax is dangerous and addictive only use it in absolute emergencies"" then I got super loaded and went ""Let's eat some Xanax while drunk, what's the worse than can happen""  I blacked out, vomited in the bathroom and lost use of my legs for a day.

I am like waaaaay too casual with getting really loaded and when I get super loaded I am very uncomfortable with how dumb I get.

Any help? Thanks.",6

I'm a 25 year-old alcoholic, been drinking heavily since I was 18. In 2016 I went to rehab and managed to hit 8 months sober, but I have been struggling since then. Lately it's been 750 mL of vodka every day during 2-3 day biweekly binges. I finally made a call to reach out for addiction therapy and will be trying some online AA meetings Most importantly, my family has my IDs (I definitely don't pass for old enough to drink).

The third-last time I drank, I started having an upset stomach that was consistent for a few days. I had my liver tested (I was fixated on that being the problem even though in reality there's a lot of other stuff alcohol affects), and when it came back fine I drank again. Cut to a few weeks later (4-5 total) and it's still upset, usually only when there's food in it, with some mild discomfort around my bladder. I am keeping in touch with my doctor about what to do, but it's hard to distract myself from it. I'm sure it's stress/stomach lining related, but the fear/worry is making it hard to distract myself with other things.

Basically, I'm just looking to maybe hear from others who have had GI issues so I know I'm not alone. I get that I'm young, and there are alcoholics who drink far longer than I have, but I also recognize that every drink/binge is still a risk. 

I'm more willing to stay sober than I've been in a very long time.",5

So I am a new mother who is breastfeeding. I plan my drinking around when and if I can nurse my baby. If I have milk stored in the fridge for her, why not drink? I never store milk that may be contaminated with alcohol nor do I nurse when I've been drinking. Baby is always my first priority. Plus we have formula for the times she needs more. ANYWAYS i digress. 

I drink...a lot. Not just a glass of wine here and there but multiple shots quite often. I do not drink for the flavor but with the intention of getting drunk. I drink alone and pretend I haven't been drinking so my husband won't question me when I drink with him. I had 4 shots this morning by 1030am. Before I got pregnant I never drank before work. My company closed down when i was 8.5 months pregnant so I haven't been back to work since being laid off because of maternity leave.

Before I was pregnant I never drank before work. I didn't drink in the mornings. Now I drink all the time. I fear that I am becoming a ""functioning alcoholic."" 

I'm not overly sure what my point in creating this account was or why I felt the need to post this...maybe I'm just ashamed that I can't stop? If I really wanted to stop drinking I would...i quit drinking cold turkey the minute I found out I was pregnant and had no problems. But now that I am ABLE to drink I do...constantly. maybe I just need someone else to tell me I'm fucked up....? idfk. 

I already suffer from depression. But now I think post partum depression is adding to my normal, everyday depression. Plus the fact that I cannot go and enjoy a night with friends or family because of COVID.  I lied to my OBGYN about taking care of my depression when the conversation of postpartum depression was brought up because i don't think theres anything they could do to help. I have tried antidepressants and they didn't help. I see no reason to go back on them because of this. Im drinking because i see no point in things. Nothing will change whether I'm drunk or sober, so why not be drunk? 

Long story short, I think i need professional help but I'm not sure how to even begin getting this help without breaking the bank. There is no end in sight for me...",14

2020-06-27 09:43:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hgtq3w/my_wife_is_an_alcoholic_in_recovery_and_shes/,My wife is an alcoholic in recovery - and she's divorcing me," 

This is not how the story is supposed to go: normally the non-drinking spouse in a relationship gets fed up with their partner's drinking and ends the marriage. But my alcoholic wife of 24 years has initiated a divorce from me, despite my years of support as she entered recovery and frequently relapsed. Now she is living apart from our two children (16 and 21) and I in a sober house. She claims that my behavior during the marriage and the recovery process has made it impossible for her to live sober with me. She also claims that I have no value to her as a spouse or as a person and that she does not love me anymore.

Just a year ago, she was in a residential treatment program and was telling me how the counselors there called me an ""angel"" for standing by her in her recovery. And I did stand by her, literally, as she was brought multiple times to hospital ERs drunk and passed out after a binge. I held her hand in the middle of the night. I was patient time and time again when she relapsed. I loved her and I still do.

But she does not value my love. It comes down to money. I am the lesser breadwinner in the family, and after she lost her well-paying job last year after exhausting medical leave, I struggled to fill the gap in income and failed. I couldn't go from zero to 100 immediately, but she resented that I couldn't and started becoming more distant with me. It was then that I realized that her love was completely conditional and indeed that she put a dollar figure on it.

We entered marriage counseling earlier this year, and she immediately started throwing stones, blaming me for her problems. After a couple of other sessions that offered glimpses of hope for the marriage, the therapist asked in a subsequent session where we thought we would be as a couple in two years. Both he and my wife had just congratulated me on some new work contracts that would raise my income, and so he asked me to go first. I said that I thought we would emerge from this shared struggle stronger and in a better position. Then she went and said that she didn't think we'd be together in two years. The therapist's jaw visibly dropped. I was nonplussed. I never saw this coming.

I am being rejected for my loyalty and for putting forth effort into the marriage. Yes, I failed at providing for the family. I wrote a long and revealing *mea culpa* in which I listed my many faults as a lover, as a husband, as a father and as a human being. I took responsibility for my failures. I also debased myself so much that I became suicidal. Her response: yes, you are a failure and that's why I'm leaving you. I asked for forgiveness and I asked to make amends for the bad things I had done in the marriage. The offer was declined.

I pressed her for more information about why she all of a sudden decided to leave me. She finally give me a list of about 20 reasons, some of which were valid, but many of which were pure B.S. She also claimed that this list was only the tip of the iceberg and that she was too tired to keep listing all the reasons and she said it would take all night to create this extensive list.

Among the reasons was was ""you haven't taken responsibility for your failures,"" Um, excuse me, had she not read what I wrote? Probably not. Another reason that stands out was that I was not as ""spiritual"" as she was. Well, Ms Holier-than-thou, I spent many hours in church and at my bedside praying for her health and recovery. Because I didn't do it right in front of her eyes, I guess she doesn't believe me.

Is it typical for an alcoholic spouse to be this narcissistic, arrogant and sanctimonious? To me and others it seems like she has not taken responsibility for her alcoholism. Not once have I or our children received an apology for her drinking binges and the pain and suffering her drinking has caused our family. Not once has she admitted fault. It's always someone else's fault, usually mine.

I welcome your thoughts and suggestions for how to deal with this situation. My anger and sadness about the breakup of our marriage are completely unbearable.",42

The week before I left for rehab at drank at least 20 beers a day, starting typically in the morning and until I passed out or blacked out. Month before that, 12 beers a night. The night before my last day drinking, I didn‚Äôt eat any dinner and blacked out. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what stage of withdrawal I was in as I was extremely confused, could not form complete sentences, and had extreme anxiety. Once I drank I felt better but the withdraws kept chasing me until I arrived at rehab. I do not think I drank enough to have the DTs and I also did not hallucinate. Any ideas as to what was going on?

I dont crave to drink k everyday, can easily go weeks without having a drink, however on many big occasions I have a social drink and something just clicks in my head and I literally can not stop myself from drinking until I pass out or upset my SO.

I am crunch time with this, I have tried limiting my intake to 14 units per week, this failed miserably.   I am now convinced that my only saviour is abstention, and that is scary not only not ever drinking again but how I would maintain  this.

This Monday saw the last trigger event which pushed my SO over the edge.   I have started AA yesterday and looking how to build trust back with SO.   As I travel for work and have ample opportunity to lounge in the bar, I wanted to be able to prove I had abstained and build trust back.    

My thoughts were to by a breathalyser and take s text and send the video daily to prove my sobriety and hopefully build trust and confidence.

That said that would place a strange dynamic on the relationship as my SO doesn't w acc not that responsibility.

Any insights or advice would be welcomed,  been married for 23yrs.

Hes cheated multiple times, become a bully to my autistic son, petty, and we basically have no social circle anymore because he got black out drunk at our last party and tried to attack my daughter's boyfriend.  

Up to the last year or two, I just dealt with the individual issues as separate items, but now have tons of resentment built up, have opened up the marriage (if you can't beat them, join them, right?), and he is just now woefully sorry for what he's done and is begging me for a second chance.

I feel like until someone else placed value on me,  he placed no value on what I was saying and ignored all my pleas for things to be better.  

I've agreed to give him opportunity to prove himself, but I'm also cynical that any changes he makes are long-lasting and, frankly, don't care at this point whether we divorce or not.

Am I wrong for having this attitude?  Is there something I can do to help him?  Even if theres too much hurt to make things work, I'd really like to see him happier and healthier.

I also drank a few more times since then but didn't take the Naltraxone when I drank.

I want to go completely sober so I would rather take something that will help with the cravings than having to keep drinking for it to work.  Also, I tried tapering in the past and always failed and I am sick of hiding and being ashamed of my drinking.

That's how I came across Camprel online and decided I am going to ask my regular doctor about it when I go soon.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me if this medicine had worked for you in early sobriety at all?

I have a friend (m/26) who I am extremely concerned about, to the point where I feel his drinking will kill him or cause him to hurt someone else. 

It has gotten to the point where he will drink an entire bottle of whiskey himself every night and other drinks on top of that. He blacks out almost every night. He already has one DUI and continues to drive drunk. He cannot function during the day, and basically sleeps until he has to work in the evening and repeats the cycle. When he is up during the day, he cannot eat and is shaking. His drinking has significantly increased within the past 6 months. 

From what I‚Äôve been told, some friends have spoke to him about his drinking but it is usually when he is already drunk. And the conversations don‚Äôt sound very direct or productive. His friends also drink pretty heavily and when I have brought my concerns up they continue to say that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just him‚Äù or ‚Äúhe has always been this way.‚Äù 

I am now thinking that I should reach out to him individually to have a conversation about his drinking. I come from a family with alcoholism, so I guess this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo. But I have never had a conversation with a friend, specifically someone in their 20‚Äôs and has a challenging time being vulnerable. I‚Äôm wondering if folks have any helpful materials, advice, or experiences that could be beneficial for me.  Thank you.",1

Not sure I‚Äôm posting in the right subreddit but here it goes...

I (19F) have a friend (18M) with whom I have a weird relationship. We both kinda like each other romantically. He asked me out but I turned him down, his drinking being the main reason why (didn‚Äôt tell him that was the reason).

He gets REALLY drunk at night completely alone - not partying, not socializing. Like, he‚Äôs completely GONE after midnight or so. He‚Äòll stop responding to my texts and will eventually say something like, ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm really hammered.‚Äù And I never know what he wants me to say to this. I give a perfunctory response, but he‚Äôs pretty much MIA for the next 24 hours, at least. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt need to be told that he has a problem. I love him and I care about him, but I have alcoholism in my family and just can‚Äôt be around it. 

I know about AA, Al-Anon, etc. I‚Äôm not really sure what kind of advice I‚Äôm looking for here. Maybe I just want to vent, lol. 

Just some background: I‚Äôm a newer addition to this friend group, most of whom are pretty straight laced. I was clued into his drinking by a mutual friend who was basically saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt want you to know this but fair warning - I‚Äôve been dealing with this for years.‚Äù Believe me when I say I had absolutely no idea. 

I haven‚Äôt confronted him about any of this, mainly because I know nothing I say is going to make much of a difference. At least he‚Äôs not keeping it a total secret from me anymore.

I guess what I really want to know is this: how do I respond to those ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm really hammered‚Äù texts? Do I make light of it? Confront him about it? Just ignore it? I‚Äôve aired A LOT of my dirty laundry to him, but he hasn‚Äôt really reciprocated. I feel like if he‚Äôs telling me about the drinking, in any capacity, he‚Äôs trying to let me in a little bit. I‚Äôm just not sure how to respond, especially when he goes radio silent afterward.

If you read all of this, thank you. I‚Äôm just concerned because I feel like he‚Äôs so young to be this far a long, so to speak. But maybe I‚Äôm making a big deal out of nothing and meddling in something that simply isn‚Äôt my business.

Any responses are appreciated.",7

His family, particularly his two brothers, deal with some horrific alcoholism. I know he hasn't told me the full extent, but what he has told me is heart breaking. I haven't met his family much, and I think this is why. He also still lives at home, and I think it's because he feels guilty if he leaves them for too long. 

This has really affected him lately and besides being a shoulder to lean on, I don't know what to do. I am talking him into seeing a therapist, and he agrees that would be a good step, but he has admitted he is scared of confronting the way he feels about the whole thing. 

I've had the fortune to never have dealt with addiction in my family or otherwise, so i don't know how else I can help, and I feel there isn't much more I CAN do anyways. I just hate seeing him hurt like this.

My husband is a functioning alcoholic. He goes through cycles where he heavily drinks and promises to stop the next week but never does. 

He has stopped for a small amount of time but becomes very irritable and gets mad, yells at me, and points the finger at me to ‚Äúlet him drink again‚Äù. I tell him it‚Äôs his decision but he says it‚Äôs not because I get mad about it. 

He starts off slow and then I increases the frequency and volume. He typically drinks 2-3  9-11% tall Can beers a night and one regular can the same percentage of alcohol. Or a bottle of wine and whatever else he can get. He stopped hard alcohol, supposedly. I have found him sneak it in his drinks.

Anytime I confront him about his drinking he always flips the script and says it‚Äôs like my eating habits. I‚Äôm not in the best of shape but I do work out. I could eat less carbs and he always points out that I can‚Äôt go 2 days without eating carbs and compares it to his drinking. He thinks it‚Äôs crazy that I‚Äôd like for him to stop when I can‚Äôt go without carbs.  I would like to say I don‚Äôt eat terrible all the time, but I think he sees my inability to lose weight quickly like he can as my weak point, like alcohol is his. He feels that ‚Äúeveryone in the world‚Äù can drink but him and it‚Äôs my fault. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. We‚Äôve been together 10 years and have a child together. I get that it‚Äôs an illness, but he‚Äôs never fully committed to stop drinking and when he does he badgers me to drink again... leading to him yelling at me and attacking me for what I eat. The last time he did this I was about 6 or 7 months pregnant and I let it go so I wouldn‚Äôt put any stress on the baby. 

It irritates me that he brings up my eating habits and it makes me fold to him. What do I do? Is this typical behavior of an alcoholic to flip the script? I can‚Äôt articulate an argument good enough for him that alcohol and eating are not one in the same. How do I prove this to him? I tried telling him that his drinking causes problems with us and my eating only effects me.

Now, this isn‚Äôt anything new.  He‚Äôs been an alcoholic since probably long before I was alive.  It‚Äôs starting to come to a boiling point, though.  It‚Äôs getting more and more extreme, especially these past few months/years.

He‚Äôs sober during the day, but once 5 PM hits, he starts out with a couple of beers, and then goes to straight vodka on ice.  He probably has 5+ before the end of the night.  When he‚Äôs drunk, he turns into a man I don‚Äôt know.  He‚Äôs not aggressive or physical, but he‚Äôs belligerent and has no idea what he‚Äôs saying.

He will post some of the most racist and sexist things on Facebook that I have ever seen and it breaks my heart because that is not the man I call my daddy.  He will pass out at his desk during dinner, wake up, eat, pass out, and this cycle continues until all his food is gone and my poor momma cleans up his dishes. He never remembers the night before.  He always plays the pity card when my mom and I try and tell him to stop drinking and thinks we‚Äôre ganging up on him.

My mom has given him an ultimatum multiple times saying either he stops drinking, or she‚Äôs gone.  And he‚Äôs agreed, but he continues.  He‚Äôs completely addicted and he knows it.  He acknowledges he needs help, but I don‚Äôt think he really realizes it.  I‚Äôm so scared that my dad is slowly killing himself.  I just want him back and him to be happy again.

I know this because I still live at home and she‚Äôs fine in the morning. However, as the day goes on, she gets more drunk. 

She buys wine and drinks my dads beer. She hides her drinking from everyone. We‚Äôve found empties in a number of spots of the house. Caught her in the middle of the night and morning downing a mini bottle of wine. It‚Äôs no secret that she has a major drinking problem

This has been going on for at least over a decade now. My father and I have tried everything. We made the house a dry house and then she just goes and buys alcohol from the store. We had a mini intervention with her best friend and they went to an AA meeting afterwards. Keep in mind that this was the only AA meeting she went to and lied about going to the rest after that day. We tried therapy with just her and with both her and my dad in the room. The session with both of my dad and her went great. After that we tried to have her go by herself. She missed numerous appointments and her therapist black listed her. We‚Äôre worries that if we try another therapist that this would happen again and potentially be black listed by every therapist. We‚Äôve had numerous heart to heart, intense, heart wrenching conversations and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get help‚Äù and does nothing about it.

She accuses my dad of being a cheater, a piece of shit and fat. She calls him names like a little kid and shows no respect even though he‚Äôs been paying for everything the last 7 years since she retired (quit her job because of her alcoholism). She‚Äôs locked my dad out of the house, embarrassed him and her self in front of friends, bailed on plans and trips the last minute. As soon as my dad comes home from anything, there is a 50/50 chance she‚Äôll make fun of him, accuse him of being out and cheating (basically makes him miserable as soon as he comes from a hard day at work). She has even hit my dad a few times (thankfully my dad did not retaliate).

Overall she has a major drinking problem that is affecting her and everyone in my family. It breaks my heart to see my mom whither away like this.

Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this?",3

I did my school year and im leaving my house to the same rehab. Im scared asf i dont know why. When im at my balcony after a few shots of vodka and smoking a cig, im just thinking man, i want to feel this way. Not euphoric, but the way this world sucks, and i dont want to be different person, i want to be this way. I dont like to take medications and do some sad persona inside myself. Maybe i like this way how i feel. Just posted here some insights, 24 hours sober and im scared. I did my school year as i mentioned, and i have a feeling i will stay here like 2 weeks, to just wean myself off the alcohol, and then ill leave. Maybe ill be without place to stay after that. But i feel the way im not ready to do this.

Be safe everyone. Its not easy to feel this way and its even worse to struggle with substance abuse.

Then at work i heard a whisper in my ear and audibly yelled, and looking out the window today kept seeing faces in the silhouettes of the trees. Horrible evil ones.

2020-06-20 23:22:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hczu0s/highly_functional_alcoholic/,Highly Functional Alcoholic,"I am doing pretty well in life, but I think I need to drink less. I'd like to reduce my drinking so that I only do it on weekends and when I'm being social. 

The issue is that I really like drinking, and I'm a highly functional alcoholic. I have been drinking nearly every day for about 10 years, and prior to that, I binge drank about 2-4 times for about 15 years. I mostly drink beer, and typically have about 8 on weeknights, and 12 or more on weekends, but those numbers can sometimes be 50% higher. I get pretty mild hangovers, unless I've had quite a lot; I get myself to work in the morning and do my job the day after drinking, even when I'm not 100%. I have a master's degree, and decent career. I pay my bills, and I own a house and investments. I have good personal hygiene. 

I'm also a single dad. I take care of my kids full time. I cook for them, and take them to and from school. I take them to after school sports, and attend their games and performances. We travel a lot on weekends and summer holidays. 

At this stage, I don't have many serious consequences as a result of my drinking. My health is is pretty good. I exercise fairly frequently and I have normal liver function. My ex wife had issues with my drinking, and it was certainly a contributing factor in our divorce, but I'm confident that we would have divorced regardless of alcohol. 

I like to think of myself as a good drunk; I'm not mean or violent, and I can (and prefer to) perform most tasks when I am drunk. I usually drink alone in the evenings after work, but enjoy being with other people too. I don't drink at work, and I rarely drive while drunk. I am responsible, and try so that my choices do not harm other people. I know that my kids are probably harmed, but they're doing pretty well, too. 

I have not had a drink in four weeks, and plan to go two more weeks before having a beer. I'd like to reset my habit, and give my body a chance to heal and recover. I'm worried that I will just fall back into my old habits again. I don't want to stop drinking entirely, but if I continue on the path I've been on, I could see it doing harm to my life and health. How do I reduce my drinking without stopping entirely? AA Meetings aren't really an option for me.",1

2020-06-20 18:10:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hcutpm/thoughts_on_guilt/,Thoughts on guilt.,"I'm writing this post because a lot of the blog related posts covering this topic are simply too politically correct and sanitized. They tend to gloss over stuff, don't provide enough details or focus on very weak points. 

Before we begin, do know that the following is written in hindsight after years of quitting drinking. For this reason this is absolutely not a ""How to cure an emotional hangover"". 

I hope that some of you get comfort from this. 

Guilt brought about by drinking comes in 2 varieties. 1) Inconsequential moments 2) Character defining. 

When it comes to guilt, 2 points of views matter, yours and those of others. 

Let's discuss the inconsequential first. But the reality is that sometimes the lines do blur. 

Inconsequential in this context doesn't mean without any consequence, rather though there are no long lasting consequence to your peace of mind. Basically events you might be embarrassed about but not exactly soul destroying. These events pale in comparison to what we'll discuss soon. Some examples of these are throwing up at a party, drunken karaoke or maybe having an emotional episode. From both observer and your point of view these events typically get written off as ""Oh he/she was very drunk"" and forgotten about. From your point of view, most of this stuff you've also forgotten about or it just simply doesn't bother your conscience.  

Now, the real meat of this discussion is the second category of events which are seemingly character defining. Here again it's important to remind you that there are 2 points of view. 1 is yours and the other is those involved (or the observer). 

These are the real events that cause guilt. Ranging from mildly disturbing to extreme (acute) guilt that can last well into your future. Guilt doesn't tend to hover around you though, it tends to come in waves and it's a good idea to deal with it rather than shy away from it. 

Before we cover any examples. Do be realistic. Don't pretend stuff didn't happen. Don't try and lie to yourself. All those things did happen. The reality is that alcohol removes inhibitions and safeguards and there's nothing special or wrong with you. You were simply a victim to the effects of this drug. 

Now let's talk about examples, yes this will be a long list, and some of these items might appear horrific but that's the reality. It is also by no means concise. 

\- Getting into physical altercations and getting your ass handed to you on a plate. 

\- Having an entire party of people turn against you or reject you. And waking up the next day knowing you've just committed social suicide. 

\- Having had some sexual encounter with someone way below your standards. Hideously lower than your standards. Some people have even had homosexual encounters even if they're straight or straight encounters if they're homosexual. 

\- Sleeping with someone you really shouldn't. Your best friends mother or girlfriend. your wife's sister. 

\- Ending up in prison for the night. 

\- Committing a DUI and getting caught. Losing your license. 

\- Sleeping on the streets. Either for one night or due to constant drinking problem becoming homeless. This can be extremely shocking if you are actually not homeless or are an otherwise high flyer in society and yet know you have curled up next to a homeless person. 

\- Destroying your marriage. 

\- Destroying friendships. 

\- Destroyed family relationships. 

\- Given people dirt on you. Perhaps your family or close friends are aware of some of the above. 

\- Lost your job or totally ruined your reputation at work due to some ""The hangover"" type of crap. 

Alright you get the picture and it's not nice or pretty. But surely once you quit drinking you'll feel like a new man and this shame will evaporate? 

Well yes and no. Yes you will feel like a new man and at least for me I was so focused on my new life that it really did keep the guilt at the door for many years BUT.... 

After many years you start to really take a very sober and clinical look at your past life. Before when you first quit drinking you might have had some empathy towards yourself, but as more time passes and you become more and more estranged from your previous drinking persona you might start to even question your own character or sanity. 

This is especially true when you've done some horrific things. Things you wished no one knew about and things you'll never tell another living soul. 

Let me remind you there are 2 points of view. 

Let's discuss the observer first, being somewhat less important. The observer is judgmental and unforgiving. They form  a crystallized impression of you based on how you acted in your drinking days. It can be extremely hard to try and recover from this. 

My philosophy is, unless they're actually a fixture in your life don't bother. Write them off as a lesson learned and part of your history. Do not try and rekindle with these people because they will forever have the dirt on you. In an ideal world you would just start over. Just remember in life, by far the vast majority of people from your history years or decades ago, you'll simply never encounter again. Don't stress it. 

But where it really hits home is on the family or in law side. These are people you will know (most likely) until one of you dies. Here there is no good solution. Only remember that you're under no duress to actually pursue a relationship with a judgmental person. You'll see them every so often at family events and if you think they're perfect well they're not. Often in life ""The wheel turns"" as they say. Some members of my family were severely critical of me, and now years later, some of these are right up shits creek in their own lives. 

So here's my experience. For the most part if you've changed job or maybe even moved, chances are in your daily life there will be very few people around you who are aware of your alcoholic past. They'll judge you fairly in your current state. But every now and again (at least in my experiences) someone shows up. Some reminder. This might even be on social media. An example would be you befriend someone and then notice they have a mutual friend of someone who has dirt on you. Could also be you attend some event or start a new job and there's that one guy there. What I can say is that in my case, this person DID actually try and stir up gossip. But the end result was that I wasn't fired and after about a year of that happening, people simply move on. No one actually cares. Also worth mentioning that this particular person didn't have all that much dirt on me to begin with. 

Now let's move on to YOU, your opinion matters more than the observer. You are the only one who knows the full story. The only one with the complete compendium of fuckups committed to your memory and archived. Every last embarrassing moment. Every questionable decision. All the cringe, all the shock, all the events that can lead to shame and guilt. 

As I've said, success and moving past that drinking stage at least helps to balance your overall weigh in when pondering these things. But it doesn't really do anything to once and for all squash every last trace of guilt. 

So what's the solution? I try and form a healthy relationship with this guilt. I'm so terrified of repeating any of this or losing all the respect I have since quitting drinking that I'll never return to that. I see it as battle scars. They're not pretty but they're a stark reminder. 

I also know myself and I know I'm not perfect but I have lived. Both having done great things and also terrible and horrific things. Life is too short to spend worrying about things you can't change. 

To simply understand and accept the duality of man and the effects of drinking. Would you have done those things sober? No! How can you prove it? Since being sober have you done anything like that?",27

I know we must frame the intervention as the family being on her side not against her and talking about our love for her and hope for the future not condemning her for her past. But other than that I am not sure where to start/ how to orchestrate it. ALL TIPS ARE HELPFUL.
-how to initiate the intervention -who to have present/how to instruct them to act -finding a mediator? -ANY recommendations for rehab programs/ mental health facilities that offer 30 day+ programs -How to deal with pushback and fighting during intervention

Whenever I'm with my friens and they drink, I don't mind. However, my boyfriend drinks. He isn't an alcoholic, he drinks on the weekend and responsibly.  But whenever he talks, mentions or even drink an alcohol beverage, I get scared.

I get scared that he'll yell at me, scream, get hurt, have me take care of him or watch him hurt himself. In general, him drinking scares me. But he grew up where it was normal to have an afternoon beer, to have a beer with a family member or to drink on the weekend (all of this responsibly). 

I never knew that drinking everyday and having your child take care of you was not normal. It affects me when it shouldn't. He knows about my dad and has met him (while he was drunk) and he doesn't mind. He's there for me and knows my reaction and thoughts upon it.

She drinks every time she comes over here and I‚Äôm really concerned for her.

She wanted to come over tonight (June 19th) but I told her no; I still have some mild symptoms of this viral/bacterial infection I got from bf. We thought it was covid, test came back negative, but I‚Äôm honestly not in any state to be around her right now.

His son (14M) doesn‚Äôt like her coming over, the last time she came over I was in the bedroom for a while doing required professional development for work (I‚Äôm a first grade paraprofessional, also known as a teacher‚Äôs aide). I didn‚Äôt want to come out at all because I knew she would be all over me. I even locked the door to our bedroom.

Sometimes we stay up until 5am essentially ‚Äúbabysitting‚Äù her. I‚Äôm a social drinker, but I don‚Äôt drink around her because I don‚Äôt have the desire to. Her mom died around 2012 or 2013, and she‚Äôs still not over her death. She doesn‚Äôt understand that alcohol makes her more depressed. And she usually listens to songs that make her cry, so then she‚Äôs really inconsolable. She‚Äôs also heavily attracted to me when she‚Äôs drunk, and that makes me very uncomfortable (I‚Äôm bisexual, but I‚Äôm not attracted to her. She‚Äôs pretty, just not my type).

She‚Äôs awesome when she‚Äôs sober. I just don‚Äôt know how to tell her that she needs to stop drinking, that she‚Äôs slowly killing herself. I know that if her mom was around still, or could speak to her right now, that she would want her to stop drinking. She will bring over a smallish bottle of vodka (not sure of the measurements, maybe 375ml?) and drink that whole thing throughout the night and chase it with soda. Bf said that she‚Äôs okay if she‚Äôs controlled, but I don‚Äôt want to have us control her, because we‚Äôre not her parents.

Any advice would be appreciated. And I‚Äôm sorry if any of this is deprecating to alcoholics, I‚Äôm really trying to be as polite as possible. TIA.

My husband still drinks, did I mention I quit smoking too? I find that I cant talk to him, we dont have sex, he is drinking the same amount and I cant stand him. I feel like he isnt taking it seriously, he doesnt talk to me about it, unless I mention it. He is annoyed all the time with me, like he wants to argue. WHen I call him on it he changes the subject or gets defensive and talks about when ""you were drinking you did.."" this or that. I know I am quite absorbed in this, we used to smoke and drink together everynight, and since I quit there is no communication at all.. if there ever was. I have been with him for 24 years, and I truly feel like I dont want to know him, he is boring and seemingly angry now that I have quit. Which is something that he asked me to do for a very long time.

I am confused and dont know how to get him to talk to me. I have yelled, I have been nice, I dont seem to be able to get through to him. I really think he doesnt want to be here any longer, and now that the drinking has stopped he has no excuses... does that make sense? Anyone going through this or has any advice?",5

the depression is real. it sits on me like a big fat fat person. my computer desk and surrounding floor is littered with bottles full of piss. i havent left this room much at all in the last 5 years. i play video games nonstop and binge drink non stop until last month. there was even a point i got a cooler and was taking shits in it during and in between games. theres a dumpster just beside my window in my computer room and i would open the window during the night and empty the shit out of the cooler into it. thats what alcohol did to me. i would also not clean myself and went over a month no shower no nothing at a point. i simply had a stock of meth alcohol and ramen noodles to keep me going for long time. 

my mother in law from my ex had always loved me. she stopped by just over a month ago to tell me my ex had died from heroin and alcohol abuse. that hit me hard. she sat next to me on the couch and held me while i cried. i loved my ex but we couldnt be together. we hurt eachother. 

long story short i ended up having sex with my ex mother in law that day and she has come over several days and nights since then. she has changed me. i have gone without alcohol for almost a month now with her help. 

welp. thats my story. i know its fucked up but i wanted to let you guys know what a shit show my life was and that im doing better. i even got a job at the local Ross as a cashier. gotta start somewhere....",2

They drink 3-4 times a week, and when they do they get drunk. When my boyfriend has tried to talk to them about this they always have an excuse, stress, occasion, nice weather etc. They‚Äôve been like this for years and I‚Äôve only really thought about this seriously since moving away, being an outsider now looking in. It‚Äôs always the same pattern of getting very drunk, purging out how they feel and then it‚Äôs like they forget about it all and carry on their day. None of them can ever remember what they do or say... like they blackout. 

I‚Äôve tried to talk to my boyfriend about it and he always says that this is how they‚Äôve been for years, and I understand that more often that not people will deny they have a problem (I‚Äôve been there with binge drinking alcohol as a student, which is usually the norm) but I‚Äôm really worried about all of them. They don‚Äôt seem to take it seriously and it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I really don‚Äôt want to be around them when they‚Äôre drinking anymore, which is having a knock on effect on our relationship.

I‚Äôm worried that they‚Äôre using alcohol as a crutch to vent how they feel, and I don‚Äôt want to dismiss them as alcoholics cause alcohol might not be the root of the problem...

Any advice on anything more I can do?",4

I started off abusing alcohol, not so much needing it like my later alcoholic self, but still would crave a drink every time I went out.

I remember how many awful decisions I made due to my alcohol use. Endless drug binges, trashy booty calls, run-ins with the law, drunk driving, abusive relationship. I was in constant physical and emotional pain. I was done with the everlasting feeling of dying. My brain felt like it was a lime being juiced every day that I decided to drink. I made those decisions back then, and on the 17th of April 2019 I got help.

I showed up to my really great restaurant/nightclub job plastered as hell. While I was stumbling around my boss took notice and pulled me aside to tell me I was fired for being drunk. I walked right across the street, freaking out, and called an ambulance. I told them I needed medical attention because I was a severe alcoholic having a suicidal panic attack. 

I was picked up by police and spent that night in the hospital. Through the night I felt so guilty for putting the hospital staff in a position where they had to care for me. I was such a waste of space. I sat in withdrawal pains worse than any I've had before for at least 5 hours before I requested ativan to knock me out.

The next morning I spoke to a social worker and I told her I needed to get help for my alcoholism or I'd probably die. We ran through options and they found a bed for me very close by in a psych ward.

I crammed through detox, which was a hell of an experience. Very bonding but also very terrifying. The people there had all been in and out at least 5 times. And from the way I looked at it, if these people all went through treatment, but they're still back, does treatment work?

And the answer is yes, it does. But you have to remember to keep a good mindset. You're never one step ahead of the disease. It's always going to have the jump on you. I never attended treatment.

I was the cynical one, the one who said it wouldn't work for me. And that was my decision. I chose a different, less expensive route, and that's the one of personalized therapy, consisting of better routine, eating habits, spiritual practice, friendship.

I know if I turn around and drink, I'll become an alcoholic. So what I do now is I don't drink. It works. Really well. I think about how my girlfriend and I will get to start a family and I won't ever die in a DUI accident. Or get sloshed and cheat on her. Or stumble in late every night acting like everything is okay.

My religion is myself and for that reason I feel like I was successful in overcoming, thus far, my alcoholism. I love myself and what I feel I can do for my fellow people. Alcohol was the thing that held me back, even though I felt like it made me better at everything. It really just made me into the person I least wanted to be.

It's time to stop. I am making a day to day log on my feelings after quitting. Here it is. 

Day 1: Woke up feeling decent, no withdrawal, and I felt like I had an almost clear mind. I think my vaping is stopping me from feeling all the way better though, I'm going to the gym later, been over 2 years since I've gone.¬†  
Day 2: Slept well, however, I felt like I couldn't get out of bed, once I used my vape, I was good to go. My thoughts have been much better the last 2 days without alcohol. I think the next thing to quit is vaping, but one thing at a time. Don't want to relapse.¬†  
Day 2 (continued): I had some bad stress when I got home from work, and followed was an anxiety attack, and restless legs when I tried to sleep, I took a benzo to relieve it. It helped me a lot, but I can't get into another bad habit. Especially taking benzos to calm down. However, I still did not drink alcohol.¬†  
Day 3 (morning): I got 5 1/2 hours of sleep, It was a little easier to get out of bed, but I feel a little groggy from the benzo I had last night. I still needed my vape to get me out of bed, but I managed to get up a bit quicker today.  
Day 3 (later): I went to the gym and did some deadlifting for the first time in a awhile before work, I was happy that I could do 235lbs, and I felt good afterwards.¬†  
Day 3 (night): I can't sleep, my legs are worse than last night. I took another benzo and then a little later I took a shot of whiskey, I feel dumb.¬†  
Day 4 (morning): I woke up feeling okay, but I feel disappointed in myself for having a little relapse on alcohol, it was only 1 shot, but I still shouldn't have done it. I feel like I'm starting all over.¬†  
Day 4 (Night): Went to the gym after work, I bench pressed for the first time in god knows how long. I was disappointed in myself because I couldn't do much weight, only did 115. A guy asked me if I needed help because he saw me struggling, I politely declined and after a few more sets, I left because I was embarrassed. I guess those feelings come with the process of getting stronger.¬†  
Day 5 (morning): Woke up feeling good, I'm going to watch YouTube videos on how to bench properly. I think I couldn't do much weight because my technique was off, might go back to the gym before work later.¬†  
Day 5 (Night): I feel like I can go right to sleep, had a good workout and decent day at work, I am very tired.

It has been one week and one day since quitting drinking. I have been having bad issues with nausea and vomiting. Sometimes I wake up nauseous like I'd drank half a fifth the night before. The other day I woke up early, early feeling so sick. I just rolled around in bed for hours until about 1pm and my body finally decided to vomit. 

The doc prescribed me Zofran and Pepcid, one of the nausea and one for stomach acid. Let me tell you, this Zofran is a god send... I have never in my life had it before and after I took it I almost shed tears because I have never had such fast and immediate relief from my nausea. 

I looked it up on Google and it said withdrawal symptoms should go away by 7 days. Well, it has been 8 days and I feel sick still. Am I being too hasty? When do I feel normal again?

I lost my sister to alcohol a couple of months ago and I still can't wrap my head around it.  The cause of death was liver failure.   Only  a year earlier she was hospitalized and warned that if she didn't stop she was going to die.

She had two great kids, 12 and 13 that she lost custody of and she was living a pretty awful life that she could only be described as chaotic.  I know she didn't choose to be this way, but I can't help but feel like she could have made better choices along the way.  She was living in England and it was impossible to get her to come home.  I can't tell you how many hours I spent on the phone with her.  

When I was a kid 16 or 17 , I worked in bars and I would see those old guys who would be in there every night.  They would be nice enough, but so sloshed all the time.  You could never get a straight story out them.  The bartenders would tell me not to waste my time talking to them, that they wouldn't remember anyway.  It didn't take me long to see what they were talking about.  

The hardest part was when I realized my sister wasn't that much different.  We would be on the phone and she would be repeating the same story she already told me.  In a way I felt like she was already gone.  It still sucks.  She was a good person but her need to keep drinking and to hide it made it hard to be in her corner.  I am going to miss her for the rest of my life.  And her kids, no one deserves to be brought up like that.  I know she wouldn't have done this to us if she had a choice.

I have a close friend (46M) who does not drink daily, but does tend to binge drink a several times a month. When he has binged on consecutive days, he gets a very distinct, strong, unpleasant aroma.  It is a sort of acrid barnyard manure smell and it is present both on his breath and on his skin.  It is not present if he has had little or no alcohol for 24 hours or so.  I have never smelt this odour on any other people in my many many years as an adult, but it has been consistent when this particular friend binges, over the 8 years I have known him.

I was wondering if this could be a symptom of liver damage?

In my estimation, he frequently drinks more than the recommended limits.  However, he does not drink on a daily basis.

I (34 M, \~1.8m, 80kg, excercise 1-3 times a week) am getting nervous about my alcohol usage (or more, my bodies response) . I've been drinking since I was 16, during Uni I would be able to drink alot (20+ beers) maybe 3 times a week. 

I've always tried to keep total sober days. Since working life started (around 9 years now) I've been drinking mostly on Fridays and saturdays pretty much all-in for the first 4 years, and shifted a bit down the last 5 I would say.

Now I drink maybe 3/4 to a full bottle of wine once a weekend. 

I don't have the idea that alcohol dominates my mind, or my life. However, I now (last 3 years) have hangovers that last for 5 days or something even after 1 bottle. It's not the usual hangover that I had when I was 16, but more like tired, anxiety, sweating, and my brain feels 'mushy' (googling this tells me those are actual withdrawal symptoms). 

I went to the GP the other day (South Africa) and he told me that I was a mediocre drinker at best, and should not worry too much, he did take blood samples and everything was completely fine. 

I'm about to getting married to my fiancee, and we're trying to have kids, I'm just planning my feature here, and I just hope I'm not too late.

Would it still be possible to 'socially drink' (and I really mean not a drop more than 2 glasses), would abstaining for a few months help?

I know that the correct answer will always be 'just stop drinking', but I'm still believing that I can get this under control.

My husband (28M) and I (32F) have been together 6 years, married 5. We had an unconventional relationship to where, literally 2 weeks after meeting for the first time we moved in together. We just knew that we were it for each other. After a month of being together is when I realized that he had a serious drinking problem. I was married before to an drug addict and knew this wasn‚Äôt something I was prepared to go through again. I told my husband (then boyfriend) that I love him but I couldn‚Äôt ask him to change so I was going to end the relationship. He immediately said that he had no problem quitting and literally quit the very next day. He went two years without touching another bottle, never talked about it, and if anything was brought up, he would say that he was so glad he quit. He was happier, more productive, nicer.... Life was perfect! 

Out of nowhere after being sober for 2 and a half years, he decided he could ‚Äúhandle it‚Äù (being the stress at work) and started drinking again. He started off drinking on weekends only and just a couple beers, then every other day, till it was every day, 6-12 beers. When he drinks, he picks fights and we argue all night, he‚Äôs cruel with his words, but then he wakes up he‚Äôs apologizing, telling me how sorry he is, he knows it‚Äôs the drinking. This went on for awhile when once again, I told him this isn‚Äôt what I need in life, he‚Äôs better than this and I would be there and help him if he was ready to quit. He did, it was a struggle this time around. I stayed patient, I loved and supported him, until he got over the worst of it. He stayed sober again for about a year. Then he started drinking again, quit again, drinking again etc.. for awhile. He quit once again and said this was it. Not worth the turmoil it causes our marriage. Then he comes home from work one day, looks me in the eyes and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a man, and if I want to drink I‚Äôm going to, but I will handle it and not drink every night, love you‚Äù then walks away with a case a beer he brought home. 

He surprisingly handled it well for months, not going over board, just drinking occasionally. Of course, that didn‚Äôt last, now he is meaner than ever, verbally attacking me (which is new for him). However he has no interest in quitting again. Admits he‚Äôs an alcoholic, but said he doesn‚Äôt want to change it. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. He‚Äôs a wonderful caring husband when he is sober, he still apologizes every time he says something he shouldn‚Äôt t have when drunk, but refuses help, professionally or not. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I need advice. Do I give up on our marriage and walk away? I love him but I‚Äôm not sure I can handle much more.",7

I have also taken steps to remain sober, seek counseling like AA, and deal with this disease appropriately. I have been sober now for four months. It really is a struggle sometimes to remain that way, but I have remained steadfast so far. I hope that through continuous self improve and dedication I can remain that way. I know it won‚Äôt be easy but I am willing to try. 

This all culminated with being arrested for a DUI, at the beginning of the year. That really was my breaking point where there was concrete evidence I didn‚Äôt have control of my drinking problem. 

Now with that present, I‚Äôm not necessarily ‚Äúashamed‚Äù as it were, but it will still linger over my life. The trouble I am facing now is I am seeing this girl, and I‚Äôve actually known her for a while and reconnected with her recently. So her perception of who I am is definitely not in line with what has happened since we last saw each other. 

I want to know if there is any advice of how to break the news to her that this happened. Not just for her, but being able to inform others in my life of these new boundaries I have regarding alcohol and how it has effected me negatively. 

I said I‚Äôm not necessarily ashamed, but I am aware it could be a deal breaker for some. I don‚Äôt want to lie to her about it, that‚Äôs just creating a rocky foundation from the start and any google search will show my mug shot. So there‚Äôs no sense in hiding it anyway. 

I want to tell her, I just don‚Äôt know how. Some of it might just be me being afraid of what the result of telling her might be. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to break the news to someone that you are an alcoholic and that you have a criminal charge because of it?",4

I¬¥m here to beg those in reddit who are, or have been, functional alcoholics with families to help me (33 now) understand how their denial worked, how they could not see what they did to their family even when told directly(many times) by them, why they did it, if they really had no clue of what was going on, or just did not want to acknowledge it... I hope this will help me understand what was, and is, going through my father¬¥s head, so I can learn to love him again, or hopefully find some peace.

I¬¥m not sure of how much information I need to give, so I¬¥ll try to be brief. My father (70 now) is a retired high school teacher. When he was active I attended his high school, and his class,  so I got to see how he was in class vs at home. Completely different person, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.  I don¬¥t want to give details about his drunken behavior, I don¬¥t want to trigger anyone, you can all imagine how it was. Awful, destructive, and only for home.

My question is, how could he fool himself into believing that he didn¬¥t have a problem? How could he wake up not remembering a thing about the previous evening, with his 12 years ol begging for them to talk about last night, because it was not normal, and shrug this off constantly? for year after year after year? How could he face those complains, and choose to get drunk, and at no point connect them I know that ""denial is common in alcoholism"", I have read it everywhere and have former alcoholic tell me that""they lie"" but that does¬¥t help me understand what happens in their mind. How does the denial look inside their heads? What do they/my father say to themselves to keep reality out? What do they say to dismiss their kid¬¥s words so completely? How does it look from the inside?How can it possibly work?

Please, if anyone that is struggling with this or has done so could share they experiences to help me understand how things looked like from my father¬¥s point of view, that would be amazing.

&#x200B;

EDIT for clarity:  With the COVID lock-down my country went into, my father no longer could go to bars. In two weeks he ""magically become someone different"". Even my enabling mother had to admit that. This was the final confirmation. Now he has been three months sober as far as we know. The kicker is that grocery stores were open through the lock-down, and in my country they sell alcohol there.  He just doesn¬¥t  like the ""idea"" of people who drinks at home, so he didn¬¥t buy any bottles. I see people in this sub-redit struggling to stay sober a month, and he just stopped cause the bars were closed?",5

Little backstory, when I was 14 my dad was a heavy drinker and refused to believe he had a problem. His quality of life started to lessen, and he was eventually not eating, losing balance, soiling himself, was completely jaundice, and he felt death creeping up on him. My older sister way later in the process and after many attempts by all kinds of people, finally got him admitted to the hospital. He died exactly one month later in ICU. 
     Now this was a couple years ago, and my moms best friend is in a very similar situation. This is a family friend of ours, and she has a very abusive husband, but she refuses to leave him. I‚Äôm not sure if her kids are aware of the severity of her alcohol problem or the fact that their dad is very bad to their mom. Both the kids live in different towns. She is facing most the same problems my dad faced, and she is also refusing help. She has yet to become jaundice, but from what my mom has seen, she is wasting her life away. My mom took her on a girls trip to try and help her, but she got stuck in some bushes, publicly embarrassed herself, soiled the bed, and has stopped eating for the most part. Her husband won‚Äôt help her, her best friend is trying desperately, and her kids have no idea what is going on. My question is: is there anything I can do or anyone I can call to help persuade her to seek medical help. My dad was so far in they couldn‚Äôt help him, but I believe there is still hope for her. She is in her mid/late 50s like my dad was. Any help is very much appreciated. I am planning on telling her son who lives not too far away, but will probably keep it from her daughter who lives far away and struggles with alcoholism as well. It may be a trigger for her. Thanks in advance!",4

He has had a serious history with alcoholism and addiction in his past. He is about 25 and has been on this sort of path since he was about 16. He has had countless wake up calls, last chances, and saving graces from the likes of our family: my 62 year old grandmother in particular. He had recently moved in with us after he had, in a drunk episode, stolen and crashed our oldest brothers fianc√©s vehicle at 110mph along with hitting another vehicle. He had lived with us for over 7 months before he was able to hold a job. He seemed like he was committed to drinking beer.(which is definitely the lesser of two evils in terms of alcoholism) in the last few weeks leading up to what had happened he had become more on edge, Unreasonable, uncommunicative, and narcissistic. I had learned also that he had found a way to supply himself with cocaine despite his lack of funds. When I would try and talk to him about it I was always greeted with ‚Äúyou have to forget about what I‚Äôve done in the past. That was the old me and now I have control.‚Äù With his actions definitely proving otherwise. Last night however he had come home with a bottle that appeared almost finished. My mother tried to get him to just go lay down but he instead got aggressive, threw an item at her head and continued being loud, waking up my grandmother and giving my mom cause to call me. Once I had showed up he was belligerent and rude. He had pushed our grandmother and blew smoke in her face despite her begging him simply to calm down. And when I asked him if he had drank liquor he replied ‚Äúwhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù

My instincts then kicked in. I immediately locked him out of the house and in the garage and began to collect myself and calm my family down. He however continued with his aggression. He banged on the door demanding to be let in but I would not. He did not need to be around our family like this and he was very aware of that. I have watched him sleep for hours in that garage and he also had access to sleep in MY vehicle which definitely had room to sleep comfortably in. He eventually broke the bolt on the door from hitting it, trapping it in a locked state and continued to beat his weight against the door occasionally taking the time to go up front and ring the doorbell a multitude of times, all the while my grandmother has to be to her job in less than an hour and does not feel safe to exit the house. Faced with this terrifying reality I did the first thing I could to try and ease my families anxieties and we called the police. When they arrived my brother closed the large garage door and hid himself inside. after talking to the officers for a short time they said they would speak to him to try and calm him down. We gave them access to the garage and they entered while my family and I awaited anxiously in the living room. After about 20 minutes the officer came back up and told us that it wasn‚Äôt our issue anymore, and that my brother had an outstanding warrant in the state in which he had committed and ran from the crime I mentioned in the beginning of this story. We did not see my brother before he was taken away. Today he had called my grandma and told her that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt even recall seeing any of us and just wanted to go to sleep, but hopes that we‚Äôre happy because he‚Äôll never see us again alive.‚Äù he is possibly facing a decade in prison for this. All we‚Äôve ever wanted was for him to get better. We truly have exhausted most of our resources to do so. My grandmother has been crying endlessly and cannot forgive herself. I did not want his life to be thrown away, but he also couldn‚Äôt keep thinking he could terrorize us and ignore the household rules about his drinking. I haven‚Äôt slept since this has happened and it is all I can think about. I blame myself. I almost feel as if things would have had a better outcome if I opened the door and knocked sense into him myself. I feel as if I‚Äôd taken his chance at turning his life around and threw it in the trash, despite him doing that himself on countless occasions. I am not seeking pity but I do not know how to cope currently. It is the only thing in my my mind and it will not go away.",2

So I've been drinking essentially everyday for as long as I can remember, for at least the last few years.  Very rarely I went a day without drinking, but I mostly drink every day.

I generally drink 8 - 11 IPA beers a day (I included IPA to make clear the alcohol content being higher). Lately it's been more because during quarantine while being unemployed, it's essentially all I have to do, so I've been day and night drinking. I have a history of drinking day and night but I generally drink during the evenings, which is what I want to get back to so I can taper. When drinking day and night, I have around 13 IPAS plus a tall can of steele reserve or something.

I drink cheap malt liquor to get the drunk I want, in order to save money.

Basically, I want to taper off. I cannot recall the last day I haven't had at least a 6 pack+. It's easily been at least over a year since I've had a dry day.

&#x200B;

Any tips? Any successes?

&#x200B;

I was prescribed with gabapentin, but I'm weary of trying it. The side effects are off putting, as I struggle with anxiety, depression, dissociation etc.

Also I'm a small female, 24 years old. 

Also: PLEASE don't comment on this saying ""you're fine you don't drink a handle a day"" like, I get that, but the severity of my drinking has changed over the years. I used to be a lot worse. Now I only let myself drink beer. Just because I'm not drinking a handle a day doesn't mean I don't have a problem.",4

I would say I'm in the gateway between an unhealthy habit and a full blown addiction. I have a pretty compulsive temperament and I have weeks of binging when I'm feeling low. 

I suppose I just need to say some stuff to try and motivate me to cut drinking out. 

Currently I drink around 3 weekdays in excess of 2-3 tins of 5% cider. 

Then Saturday I'll drink probably 1/2 a litre plus of spirits. 
Sunday will be a few tins of cider. 

I know the quantity isn't that extreme but its every week and with me thinking about drinking or giving in on my 'dry' days. 

Just probably need to just get this of my chest properly.",3

Alcoholism runs in my family and I have abused alcohol off and on over the span of 20 years. I am a functioning alcoholic and do not yet have health problems as a result of drinking. The only other drug prescribed or otherwise that I use is cannabis. That, I can take or leave.

I can go a few days without a drink. I typically drink 5 days per week.  I *can* drink without the need to get drunk but all that being said, I drink more than I want to and I have a hard time drastically cutting back.

The thing is, I recognize that I'm typically doing it to manage anxiety and stress. My brain doesn't know how to get that reward from something else. That's the main thing I want. To re-train my brain. Is there a program for someone like me that does not involve religion? I don't align with AA, all the God stuff. I think I'm looking for a treatment that focuses more on restoring that dopamine without substances. Can anyone here relate and maybe recommend a path?

Thanks!",1
2020-06-15 17:53:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/h9pr7h/fathers_drinking_problem/,Fathers Drinking Problem.,"So my father has a drinking problem. I am really concerned for him as it is affecting his quality of life with his wife and children.  

He grew up in a family where his dad was an alcoholic. He told me stores of having to drag his dad piss drunk out of a bar and take him home. His dad I guess drank to get away from things.  I have a feeling deep down this scarred him and he tucked it away deep inside because he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or deal with it. 

All throughout my childhood I don‚Äôt remember my dad having an issue. He drank but nothing to any excess. Fast forward to about 2003-2004. He was out of a job for the longest and took a job at a liquor store to help make ends meet. This is when I can 1st remember him having a drinking problem.  I was in college and I remember calling home and hearing my dad on the phone piss drunk. I began to dread calling because I didn‚Äôt want to talk to my dad in this state. He was a different person. 

His drinking was not bad all the times as he would go through cycles of begging really bad and not so bad. Once he left the liquor store and got a job back in his field things got better. He was eventually laid off from that job and I‚Äôd say about 2013-2014 it got bad again. He decided to just retire instead of trying to find a job at 60 something.  He began to drink cheap scotch or whatever cheap liquor he could get.  He got really bad. He would get so drunk he could not walk properly. This was really affecting his life especially his marriage with his wife(my mom). He gets really angry when he‚Äôs drunk and yells at people. I guess you can say he gets belligerent. A few times he was behind the wheel in this state. One time he had my young niece in the car.  Thank god no one got hurt any of those times. It was not an every day thing where he got that drunk but he drank everyday. 

He got to the point he hid his booze so we could not find it. He would drink while driving his car. Finally the family had a intervention with him where we discussed his issues. He agreed to get better and it got to the point where he had a rehab clinic picked out and was going to admit himself. It was good for a few months. He stopped drinking and he was a new man. As it turns out he didn‚Äôt qualify to go to this rehab center and they would not admit him. This set him slowly back down the path to drinking again.  He was all set to fix himself and them not letting him in the center I guess made him feel he really didn‚Äôt have a problem. 

He began drinking again and there would be good and real bad days.  He still drank liquor and this makes him an angry drunk. He‚Äôs get drunk do something stupid and the next day not drink. Then get drunk again a few days later.  To make it worse my 96 year old grandmother lives with them.   I also live here too which doesn‚Äôt help As well. My mom takes care of my grandmother but he feels she has no business being there, she need to be in a home. 

Fast forward to end of March. He was in the back yard working on a ladder fixing putting a shade cover over the deck and fell off breaking 7 ribs. I assume he was drunk at the time.  This was tough as it was during Covid-19. He was bedridden for about 4 weeks and spent time in the hospital.  He could not do much.   He was on some pretty fucked up pain meds but he was not drinking then which was good. 

After he got better he was off the pain meds and said he was staying off the hard stuff. He began drinking beer again but it‚Äôs the 8%+ stuff not Bud Light. He is not to the point where he‚Äôs raging drunk now but he has had a few too many and is getting angry.   You can‚Äôt talk with him when he‚Äôs been drinking because he‚Äôll bite your head off. He doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an alcoholic or has a drinking problem and I think this goes back to the time the rehab clinic would not admit him. He‚Äôs seeing it as if the clinic didn‚Äôt think I was bad enough to go there then I must not have an issue. He gets defensive if you say he has a problem.  You only really have till about noon to talk to him before he starts drinking. After they all bets are off. 

I just want to know what I can do to try and help him or talk with him. I know it is really all going to boil down to him wanting to help his self. It affecting his marriage severely and to top it off my grandmother is still living in the house which is a whole different issue that my mom is dealing with her family.  Any advice would be helpful to me. I want to help my father.",1

What started as occasional drinks at the bar, to occasional glass of wine at home end up as a bottle of wine or 6 beers a night almost everyday for the last year. It has been a very rough year . I realized I had a problem when I started thinking about drinking in the afternoon, not eating as much so I could drink more and started counseling for being depressed and anxious. It started me on the path of understanding that my depression and anxiety, ultimately taking zolfoft, is likely stemming from alcoholism. My counselor ran through the clinical diagnosis and I started crying. This was August last year. Fast forward, and I am now 70lbs heavier and not exercising because I can't drink and exercise at the same time. I made a commitment at the beginning of June that i would not drink for a month and I would exercise at least 4 days a week. I haven't lost a ton of weight but I feel a million times better. Getting ready to do a juice fast and started consciously drinking a gallon of water a day. The craving for wine is lingering, especially when my two young kids are making mama crazy, but I have much more tolerance, kindess and understanding. Less anxious and more like myself than I have been in years. 

I can't say this is a permanent thing, but I feel like that if I just my mindset that I can overcome anything. My goal is 4th of July and then to keep going. This is the first time I said out loud that I maybe an alcoholic. And I feel so much better saying that I am in control!!!!",2

It's weird because he goes through phases where he can drink and is completely fine, but then a month later will have a series of episodes. It's getting harder and harder to put up with his antics and I feel so helpless.

Came off a bender recently where I was drinking god knows how much for a good 4 -5 days. I went to my doctor a month ago after an episode and was honest with her and was tapering then as well before this breakdown but I'm back on the horse. She seams to think tapering is a great idea and that I wasnt completely physically dependant because I have no shaking or seizures after going 15 hours since my last drink before I start my taper regimen but since lowering my alcohol use I've had the worst anxiety of my life. Can't tell if it's in my head about the alchoholism and quitting or if it has to do with the drinking. I hate pharmaceuticals to I took half of a .5 of clonopin last night and finally slept amazingly. This morning was ok and then the anxiety started coming back so I took a quarter of one and now am drinking only 1z shots instead of 1.5 always making sure to drink less than the day before by at least one. breaking the numbers down 3 days ago i was at 18- 1oz shots. 16- 1oz shots yesterday and today Im shooting for under 15- 1oz shots because of the added small amount of benzos. Taking into consideration of true units of 1.5 oz per drink at 15 -1oz shots thats 10 reguklar units but throughout the day with water and multivitamins. I think I just need someone to tell me this will eventually go away with some more time and if someone has any advice to help out. I know I drink a ton but have also seen other taper multiple times drinking faaaaaar more than I do. Am I freaking out? is it the booze? when will this shit go away?!

I was hoping to get some advice.

I don't think that I am addicted but there are times where I come home from a road trip at 12 AM and find the need to drink because its Friday and I have to wait till next week ;\_;

I believe I need to slow down and take a break for a month and drink less frequently.

I usually take shots of gray goose.

He‚Äôs committed to stop drinking for the next 90 days, but keeps falling off the wagon. Yesterday he agreed to call his doctor on Monday to set up an appointment to talk about his drinking.

He seems so sincere when he talks about changing his ways, but nothing sticks. I can‚Äôt tell if this is a stalling tactic, or if he really wants to stop and just can‚Äôt.

After not drinking for a week, I relapsed.  During my cold turkey,  my girlfriend has been drinking EVERY night.   
She dressed sexy today and told me she was going out.  I told her I didn't want to go because all she literally does is get drunk when she goes out.  She's just walking through the front door right now.  Drunk.  As always.  I still have my sober content however, even after 5 drinks.  I've taken up working out and I feel that the hobby may free me of this curse.  As of now, I'm displeased with myself, her and this cycle.  

I just needed to rant.  Thanks for listening you all.",2

I've had bad withdrawals before and even been to the hospital before for alcohol withdrawals, but I've never experienced anything like that in my entire LIFE. I experienced tremors, didn't know where I was and experienced hallucinations for about 4 hours, terrifying hallucinations at that. I know people say they feel like they're dying when they have hangovers, but I thought I was actually dying. 

Anyways, that being said, I think I may not have a drop for the rest of my life after that experience. It was literally one of the most terrifying things I have experienced.

If you guys haven't heard of delirium tremens, I urge you to do homework. it has a 15-25% mortality rate when untreated. Perhaps use it to encourage to stop drinking or going on binges.

If anyone here has experienced DT, please feel free to share your experience.

He told me I'd be fine
Only drinking vodka, whiskey, and wine
Left alone I want to die 
Yet I see no alternative 
A last cry in my bones 
Echoes out among the tomes
That I've written in my mind
Lessons learned that I can't find
Will I ever be fine?
A loss of self, a loss of my identity
How can I reach for help when I can't reach for a drink?
Damnable anxiety forcing me into a fog
Interpersonal relationships failing, the fuck did I do wrong?!
It's for myself not for you don't misinterpret my actions
One of us has to survive to pass on what we've learned in vain hopes of giving traction
Future outcasts will need me or so I keep saying
Some days I just wish I could go back to praying
But I know it won't help
I'm six days sober and this feels like Hell",2

Day one was challenging but doable. Instead of running to the liquor store at the end of the day, I decided to treat myself to a milkshake. Maybe the car in front of me in the drive-thru could tell I was on the struggle bus because they ended up paying for me. Today was challenging but I'm hanging in there.

I've never posted on reddit before so please forgive me if i do anything wrong here  


So I'm a 22 y/o and currently attending university and enjoy a drink with my friends. Me and a few of my pals are sharing a house and we meet up for a drink in the living room for a drink around once a week and have fun. We probably would go to the pub or club but due to recent events that's not possible!

My concern is that we will buy in crates of beer and go through quite a lot of the drink that we buy on a weekly basis. I never feel like i need to drink during the week or anything. I do find that once i start drinking i do find it quite hard to stop. I can stop as I have done it plenty of times before but as it's a weekly event I am now starting to get concerned that maybe something bad is happening?  


As for myself I work out often and eat a good diet, keeping on top of my studies and other day to day things but as i read more into this kind of thing I am starting to worry that maybe I am developing something more sinister here or whether I am over reacting?",3

   I'm truly afraid that my dad is turning into an alcoholic.
   I have had some suspicions for a while and i need some validation from you guys.
 - he sneaks on the balcony (our pantry) and i hear bottles of liquor clinking

-he's a very civilized man, but at the slightest sip of booze he loses all contact and becomes a beast

-he's agressive and irritable if adressed as tipsy or drunk (which he denies even if he is constantly slurring every word)

-he gets seriously drunk from the littlest quantity of alcohol it's almost outrageous and has become a shame to sit next to him at family gatherings

     Please if anyone could help with some insight, i am truly heartbroken to see him turn into a person I don't know, but i seem to see ever so often as of late.",3

I tried to limit the number of people that saw me drink, yada yada, if it sounds familiar you might be an alcoholic; good luck.

So, today I'm sober. I found out that there is a way to stay not drinking. I found it in Alcoholics Anonymous in the form of other people that seem like they know the drill, yet, they're sober for a long time, longer than I could ever stand it, the literature, the steps, the service, all of it for better or worse, and some of it is full of worse, some of it is better than the way it was before. You know, life, man.

OK, so the AA book and all the literature in AA can be described as Kindergarten for someone like me.

I read it all because, well, what else could I do with all the empty time I used to drink?

I realized that so much of it can be traced back to really old philosophers.

Epictetus, Aurelius, Seneca, Cato; the stoics.

So, for me, Alcoholics Anonymous has been the Kindergarten that I started in when I finally showed up, sobered up, cleaned up, and growed up.

Sorry to be plain but I need help on how to get help.  My relative has been struggling with alcoholism since high school (over 10 years ago) and has gone through periods of improving and sharply declining. Unfortunately the overall trend has just been going down and my family just doesn't know how to proceed.  We have each tried speaking with him individually and as a group, seemingly getting through sometimes, other times not at all.  His problem with drinking has affected several parts of his life, from personal relationships, to work, and even hurting themselves in auto-mobile accidents.  Court-mandated AA did not seem to help as he only viewed it as ""scam"". 

&#x200B;

It came to a head recently this week, without going into detail, he was very dangerous to himself and others.  We tried to discuss again as a group, but his response was that he doesn't see it as a problem and just how he wants to live his life.  In his own words he doesn't care if he lives or dies because of it or whoever else might be affected because ""thats his own decision"".  He even goes to say he is genuinely happy like this.

&#x200B;

At this point I don't know what to do.  We know he loves his friends and family and gets remorseful after these episodes, but he also feels he is ""above"" things like AA and rehab, even though we know it can help him.  We aren't willing to give up on him, but we don't want to pressure and force him and have him cut ties with us.  Every day feels like another risk where he'll lose his job, his friends, his car, and his life.  Researching the issue always points to intervention and convincing them to get help, but we can't convince him and don't know what we are doing wrong to get him to budge.  Are there any better steps to take?",1

Happy I was able to stay sober for 1.5-2 weeks. I really wanted to do 30 days sober n try to see if I could handle my shit better...

Only felt comfortable sharing med detox with my Grandma and 1 handful of friends. Being out of work (bartender/server), a lot of my friends and I have been hiking/swimming at least once a week. N unfortunately I slipped back into my occasional exsessive binge drinking - some days I binge hard, some days minum has been a range of 1-3 5% seltzers, n some days I haven't drank at all.  

Yesterday I drank 4 9% beers and I believe 4 or 5 Genee Kolshes (5% but not sure) hiking. Started experiencing withdrawal effects maybe 6 hours ago, popped 3/4 2mg Xanax to make it stop lol about an hour ago. Stayed up through the night due to it AWD.

This is just really difficult to go though, I'd like to avoid another medical detox.

I've had my fair share of traumatic experiences and a lot thats forced me to grow - but this is easily been a brewing problem since I was 13/14, and I'm turning 26 this year.

The kindling n PAWs is the hardest though. I wish I could wish that all away, but the damage has been done. I don't have anyone I feel comfortable talking to about this. 

Made some attempts with a my closest friend, then she just went on about her ketamine addiction/""withdrawals""/cravings, which they're no where near the same ballpark n it was really discouraging. I understand she was struggling, n ik its not healthy to compare struggles - but facts are facts, right? Lmk if I'm the asshole lol. I haven't bothered talking to her about it since, I asked her to read into PAWs n kindling n I'm guessing she hasn't. The other day she slightly mentioned my drinking gotten ""better."" 

My Grandma, everytime I go to her house to help w yard work/gardening/misc, she buys bottles of wine for me and acts like I literally had to go to the hospital for detox bc I kept almost having seizures (always have xans on deck).

Maybe I am naive, but I don't wanna be completely sober - I'd like to fix my relationship with alcohol so I don't have to change everything about my life. Who knows though, may be for the best. Its just been apart of my life for so long. I truly do enjoy social drinking, wine, bartending, etc. The lifestyle, yk? I need some serious therapy. 

Anyways, if u read all this, I appreciate it. Struggling with a lot right now. The only time I cry recently is when I am interally facing my alcoholism. Like wheres that damn rewind remote from Click? Ik we'd all like one. Much love and God bless to whoever is reading.

I was there for thee days and was given I believe 5 doses of 1 mg of ativan and then gabapentin which I am not sure the dosage but I remember the pills were dark brown.  

I wasn't seeing or hearing anything anymore and could walk around and eat so I guess that made the doctor decide to send me home.  

So they send me home with one last hospital grade dose of gabapentin and 6 doses of 100 mg of gabapentin.  

I take the first dose of gabapentin at the time they tell me to and soon after I start to feel withdrawl symptoms again.

I know and I've known for a while that I'm slowly killing myself and also killing my relationship with my  partner but regardless I haven't been able to stop (and don't really want to stop as I'm sure you all know) but I guess I didn't realise just how little time I might have left and the fact that I won't ever be able to have kids if I keep going. 

I just keep thinking ""yeah, I know I need to go to rehab but I don't want to do that yet, I want to keep drinking for now, so I'll do it later""

But now I think it's really time to get serious... in a few hours it'll be one day sober/since my last drink, I'm really hoping I can keep growing that number, I haven't gone a day without drinking (other than when in hospital or detox) for well over 3 years... wish me luck!

I‚Äôve been struggling with depression since I was 14, then got traumatized, then struggled with depression some more, then got traumatized again, got a strong anxiety disorder, got pills, got out of it, found a wonderful man, bought an apartment and I have a problem with alcohol. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs physical, but it‚Äôs definitely mental.
I don‚Äôt drink every day, hell, I probably only ever drank alone once or twice in my life, but when I do it with my friends - I binge. We all binge! But I‚Äôve been doing it since I‚Äôm 14, every weekend, for years. Because everybody does right? Two years ago things with my mental health got so bad I started searching for anyone I know on weekdays to go and to a bar and binge beer till 5 am, because I knew I didn‚Äôt want to become an alcoholic - my rule was to never drink alone, because you‚Äôre only alcoholic if you drink alone, right? I never thought alcoholism would make me friends with that rule (haha). My anxiety skyrocketed, I had days I could even get out of my room to get food, all I could manage were bathroom visits. When things got so bad that I started getting panic attacks and calling ambulances, when all of this made me lose days at work, I decided to stop. For a year I went to therapy, didn‚Äôt drink a drop of alcohol, got better, met my man, bought my apartment - life couldn‚Äôt be better... And then the meds were tapered off, and I jumped back into alcohol last summer with 4-day full binges. Last summer was the drunkest that I remember, it felt awesome, but then I got health problems. Doctors don‚Äôt say anything, really, my analyses are fine, but I can feel it. If I get a chance to drink - I will drink. It was my way of dealing with anxiety and it worked while I was drunk. But then got worse when I didn‚Äôt. Quarantine helped me not drink again, I was absolutely sober for 2 months, and I even stopped smoking, but then it happened again. Just as my country allowed us to go outside and meet friends - the binging started, the smoking started and now, I‚Äôm fearing, that I‚Äôve pushed my body too far. Just one glass of beer makes my head hurt, my nose run, my cheeks flush, my insides feel swollen, there‚Äôs pain. And the worst thing is - while I‚Äôm alone, I‚Äôm ok, I can resist the temptation. When there‚Äôs a good excuse for me to not drink, like medication, I can easily say no, drink the non-alcoholic versions and be fine, but now I am struggling to find good enough reasons even thought they are so on the nose! It‚Äôs like my brain sees serious disease and death as trivial reasons to stop. Does anyone have any advice?",3

I‚Äôve also read that things that aren‚Äôt categorized as alcohol can have the same percentage as near beer like kombucha or a ripe banana. However I still have mixed feelings.

My weakness is craft beer, I believe I‚Äôve pinned a lot of my personality on the type of beer I drink and even had a shitty Instagram page with 400 follows... my current habit is nothing on the weeknights then buy lots of beer on the weekend, get drunk Friday night. Wake up and hit it again from lunch time till whenever I run out or pass out Saturday night / Sunday morning. Watching action movies on Netflix on my own. 

My other love besides my family (and Rambo) is playing music so today I lay-by‚Äôd (lay away or whatever) at the second hand store, the plan is to use the money I would have spent on beer on paying this off.

I haven't been drinking for years but have started drinking starting this year very heavily than what I'm used to. I'm young (23), have a great job from a college degree, have a wonderful husband, and two amazing children. I'm active during the day, I never drink during day time, I do fun things with my kids, I feel like I'm doing everything right, but I always look forward to nighttime when the kids go to bed because that means I can drink.

Sometimes I get drunk to the point where my husband has to carry me to bed (he doesn't drink) and sometimes I've had enough to drink where things just seem more funny to me than when I'm sober. I crave that time. 

Each morning I wake up and think ""I'm done, this is it, this isn't healthy for me to do"" but every night I find myself reaching for the glass of wine or making myself a cocktail.

Now I'm at the point where even three drinks don't have me feeling drunk, so it leads me to drink more. The scary part is is that I don't know if I can stop, I keep thinking ""well once it starts to impact my daily life then I won't drink anymore"". But what happens if I can't stop when I get to that point? I don't know. I'm scared, in the morning I say no to drinking but as the day goes on I feel myself getting more relaxed with the idea of drinking--that I deserve it and I won't drink as much as I did the night before. 

I'm worried for my kids, nothing has ever happened and they haven't seen me drinking but am I just a ticking time bomb for my children to see their mom destroy herself? I don't know what I want, my brain always feels split. I'm not sure what my intent is while writing this post, reassurance? Insight? Hope? I don't know. I'm almost out of vodka and my wines gone, debating if I should buy more.",18

I hope it's ok to share here.  And I know the first reply will be (we can't diagnose anything go to a Doctor).

So, I had a great uncle - I think it was a great uncle - on my grandmother's side (I believe) die of ALS so I am automatically thinking worst case scenario - I'm not even 40 yet (I'm going to have to ask my family who exactly it was - I'll update).  So as I am typing right now, my wrists are a little painful and I'm actually leaning towards Carpel Tunnel Syndrome... I've been programming things since I was old enough to read -- but lately I started occasionally get some finger twitches and spasms, it's extremely noticeable at night when I'm trying to fall asleep.

Last November we went to Las Vegas, where we were drinking every night...  Well, when we got home I never stopped...  And since everything closed down, and alcohol stores were 'essential' the only place to drink was at home so we've always been stocked up no.  It started with no more than 3 shots of Captain Morgan (with Apple Juice as a chaser) then after awhile I was taking 4, then 5 daily and sometimes more....  I did take a week off about a month ago, my wife said we can't keep buying this stuff - I was mildly shaking the first couple days - but was able to pass it off as caffeine and no food shakes (if someone noticed) but even though it was in the freezer, I was able to control it - it's usually easy for me not to take that first drink, but once I had one it's party time - my THC pen comes out and away we go... so after that week break, I was right back where I was, even drinking over a half of a 750 bottle of Captain Morgan on Saturday ( I started at like 1pm ).  I didn't drink anything Sunday (I was hurting from the day before and still had to get up early for a couple hours of work)--  I wasn't going to drink yesterday, but in the evening when my wife said, 'let's do a shot' I had one and then another half after that - and that was the end of the bottle....  Knowing I need to calm the fuck down, I am not buying another bottle for awhile.  I don't want to drink for a little while and see if this stops, if it does then I don't believe I will be starting back up (hopefully).

Anyway, about a month ago, I noticed some slight finger twitches.  And last night I was getting them in various places, my toe, my pinkie, my foot - very slight but enough to keep me up and start researching (I'm assuming my body is telling me I better stop).  First thing I did was look into ALS, some of the symptoms are similar, but in my research, coming across Alcoholic Neuropathy made more sense, or maybe I'm even just vitamin deficient.  I take a lot of vitamins, however, just about every day and have been for some time... Vitamin C, Zinc, D3, Fish Oil, Echinacea, Hyaluronic Acid, Iodine, and a bunch of other natural, holistic type stuff my aunt sends us (I went to the ER a couple weeks ago because I worked myself into almost a heat stroke and I was afraid I was having a heart attack) - They ultimately said I am very healthy, I just dehydrated myself and my muscles in between my ribs were spasming - but of course I was drinking most of the day, about a drink an hour so I was probably metabolizing too fast to get 'drunk' -- but otherwise they said I'm very healthy with 'lungs like an athlete' - which is interesting because I smoked for almost 20 years and vape THC a few times a week -- take your vitamins kids!  I rarely, if ever get sick. 

While I was in the E.R., I brought up I was having weird finger twitches and the doctor did the [Asterixis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEnp2ss8VoA) test on me (which I passed easily) - and that was that.  When I went to a follow up with my regular doctor, he kind of just led to Carpel Tunnel and just change positions when you get uncomfortable, I have my veridesk and multiple types of mouses in different positions.

Anyway, my wrists right now kind of hurt but it's the random twitching that is making me nervous.  After some research I am going to go to GNC and grab some bottles of Thiamine, folate, niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, and vitamin E to add to my already huge pile of 'pills' (nothing is pharmaceutical, I don't want to take any pharms, they do more harm than anything).

Has anyone had any similar twitching?  If it doesn't improve in a week or so (after not drinking) I'm going to make another appointment, I have a family and am scared to death of leaving them - they say things go downhill at 40, well -- I'm there now.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading, I just needed to get this out.",2

Not sure if anyone can relate to this, I‚Äôm 24 years old and have been sober for about 2 years. I was a pretty high functioning alcoholic (I started drinking at 12;heavily drinking at 17), but after a few massive social blow outs I decided that it was time for me to stop drinking. The thing that I have struggled with the past few years is if I am maintaining my sobriety for myself or for my fianc√© and loved ones. I do not question whether or not I had a drinking problem, as I am 100% certain that if I continued down the path I was on that I would likely end up completely alone. But the thing that I keep struggling with is that getting sober doesn‚Äôt feel like it was really a choice, but rather a line in the sand that was drawn by my loved ones. I have hear my father say a million times, that for sobriety to stick the person needs to want to get better (he has been sober for 20+ years). The thing is, I am so young and I sometimes wish that I could just let loose with my friends and feel what it‚Äôs like to be completely uninhibited again. I have no plans to break my sobriety, but I am really nervous that if I continue to think this way that it may be inevitable, and the last thing I want to do is let the ones I love down. They are so proud, it is just hard to share these thoughts with them and destroy this picture they have built in their heads of ‚Äúthe new me‚Äù.  Anyways, thanks for reading and if you have any advice or can share a common experience that would be great.",9

Thinking of quitting.,"39 year old female here, unmarried, no kids. Long term high functioning alcoholic (I'm pretty sure... self assessment tests give me varying results, but I know I drink too much, why else do I keep taking those tests?).. I have no plan right now and no specific questions, I just thought it might help me to put this out there. I am not a messy drunk, and I don't drink during the day or hide bottles, but that doesn't mean it's not a problem. Apologies for the length/boringness of this post. This is mostly for me. I haven't ever really talked about or written down anything about my drinking.  

&#x200B;

I've been a heavy drinker since my late teens. So, 20 years! Ugh. Initially it was a desperate coping mechanism for my anxiety and terrible self esteem. I was so afraid of people and any social interaction, but alcohol seemed like the magic fix, which I know is super common. I also would always drink with the specific goal of getting drunk, and that urge has stayed with me. I no longer have the same social terror (well, maybe a little sometimes) but I still want to chase the buzz. Now of course that takes a lot more booze than it used to. 

I've only recently realized that my mom might have a problem with alcohol. When I was growing up, she always had a glass of wine or sherry on the go, probably every night... and on holidays, if she was cooking a big meal for extended family, she'd start at noon. never got obviously drunk, but it was always there. Now that she's in her 70s I notice she slurs when she's had a glass or two, and starts repeating herself. Dad is not a drinker - maybe the occasional beer. I think he doesn't like the idea of not being in control. 

My brother and I both grew up with horribly low self esteem (this is worth examining, as I don't really understand why), and are both heavy drinkers. He is 37 and has a good job, but still drinks like a frat boy with his friends, and gets rowdy. Once or twice a year we'll get together ""for a beer"" and end up drinking until 8am, cleaning out the liquor cabinet, laughing like ""oops, that was epic!"" 

I make my living as a nightclub musician (so I'm currently out of work indefinitely, and worried) and unhealthy drinking is sooo normalized. Alcohol is built into the lifestyle. Everyone has their funny drunk stories but it's getting less cute at my age.  The bartenders at the clubs I played regularly know I drink a ton, but there's always a jokey 'oh, you want another one? how about a shot too?' kind of attitude. Mix the wrong drink for someone? Oh give it to RogersGinger, she'll drink anything. Lots of people wanting to hang out after the gig for a 'couple more'. Usually I'm that person. People think I'm fun - I'm the ""bad influence but not *too* bad"" friend, and it \*IS\* fun, still, mostly. But I know it's not healthy. I've watched some musician acquaintances go from being hard drinkers who could handle it and were the life of the party to messy embarrassing drunks as they get older. I'm in the former stage but am not fooling myself that I can't slide down that same slope. 

I don't even know how much I drink when I'm working. It's funny that I do most of my drinking at work.. drinks are often free, musicians are encouraged to drink, it's a shortcut to ""get in the zone"". Probably 6-10 drinks a night, easily. 2-4 if I'm ""being responsible"". If I was gigging 5 or 6 nights a week, which was my average before Covid shut everything down, that really added up.  Hangovers weren't debilitating, but I was pretty used to a persistent grim fogginess for the first few hours of the day. 

I've dated a couple of guys who also liked drinking, but eventually they'd make some comment like ""whoa I can't keep up with you!"" (few people can... I used to be proud of that). I drink a lot at the beginning of relationships especially, probably because intimacy is hard and scary, and that's an easy way for me to relax and not obsess over why I'm not good enough. My most recent ex (together 3 years) was the first one to try to get me to cut down. He was significantly older and didn't want to stay out late partying with me, and also did not like when I stayed out late after gigs without him. I knew he was right, but didn't want to slow down.. I felt like I had to be part of ""the hang"" to keep getting gigs. I think that's a little bit true (one club manager I know only hires bands who can ""hang""), but I was doing it all the time.  He also pointed out to me how much me and my brother and my mom drank at family gatherings, and suggested that wasn't normal. We broke up for a few different reasons, but my drinking/staying out all the time was an issue in the relationship. I don't get mean, or sloppy, and even when I feel drunk I don't tend to show it.. it's more that once I get going, I don't want to stop.  

I'm currently dating a guy who quit drinking 2 years ago, so I went through the early stages of the relationship without my usual security blanket of alcohol, and I found that really anxiety inducing. It's nice now, though. I will sometimes have a couple of drinks around him, but I don't feel the urge to get drunk, which seems healthy. I don't know why it was so much harder with my ex. 

The past couple years I was in a place where I wouldn't feel like drinking on my own, mostly because I drank at work most nights, but Covid-19 has changed that... now I have no job, I feel useless, and at night when I would normally be out making music with friends and earning money (and drinking), I'm home alone climbing the walls. So, now I drink alone, and bake, and try to stop worrying about the future. I'm probably consuming less than I would be if I were gigging, but it's still too much. I'm already a night owl, and having nothing to do has made my schedule weirder, so more than once I've watched the sun start to rise, poured my drink down the drain and said ""this has to stop"". 

I've taken a ""dry month"" here and there, and it's hardest at the beginning, since I am around alcohol and partying at work. Usually I feel good though, and make it through the month.. there's always the promise of resuming my unhealthy habits at the end, however. Quitting for good seems a lot more daunting. 

Basically I'm worried about my health, and I know it exacerbates my anxiety/low moods, even though I use it as an escape from that. If you made it to the end, thanks for reading. :)",11

I need some advice about what to do about my dad, his mental illness and his alcoholism. To give you some background on my dad, he is in his late 60‚Äôs and grew up in a conservative family that did not support the idea of psychiatric care or therapy, thus, he has been very unsupportive and defensive about any mental illness talk. In short, my dad was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He, however, is in denial and doesn‚Äôt believe anything is wrong with him but to combat his symptoms, he‚Äôs been a heavy drinker for most of the time I‚Äôve known him (I‚Äôm 24). His drinking has been a problem in our family for a long time causing numerous fights, broken items and threats to call the cops. My mom is now contemplating  divorce and I don‚Äôt blame her. We have tried everything to get him the help he needs. Therapy, AA, psychiatric intervention, medication, meditation, you name it. My dad would be stubborn about the whole ordeal and either would stop going after a few days or if we made him go, he would deliberately not do what he was supposed to in protest. I‚Äôve tried having a heart to heart with him about it too and he would always try to change the subject to put the blame on someone else. Lately, we have been dumping any alcohol we find in the house and have called all local liquor stores to make sure they don‚Äôt serve my dad. However, he travels a lot for his jobs so it‚Äôs near impossible to stop him from getting a hold of alcohol. I‚Äôm worried because I know his drinking problems are taking a toll on his health and he should be receiving treatment for his bpd. At this point, I just need advice on what to do next. Do you think I should keep trying to get him into some sort of rehab program or are there others measures I can take? I really don‚Äôt want to give up on him but because he is so stubborn, he‚Äôs been making it hard to get him the help he needs. Any advice you can give me or if you‚Äôve been in a similar situation and know of a solution that would be super helpful and appreciated.

It feels like an achievement when i do this, but I can never seem to make it through the next day also without drinking. I would love some tips on how to curb the cravings but also some REASONS why quitting will be good, because i am terrified I won't enjoy life without drink. Thanks guys x",4

Now while her dad has been for the most part a functioning alcoholic, I can easily tell from what my friend says and how she says it that things have been going from bad to worse and at some point i fear something might happen. Currently the relationship as I understand it is that her dad is not to a point where there is physical violence, however there is plenty of screaming and arguing that seems to be getting worse. she has tried many times to get him to quit, AA meeting pamphlet, family interventions (sort of, its important to mention that part of the problem is her fathers family are unfortunately full of enablers) and he has quit multiple times for weeks only to relapse.  I pride myself in getting down and dirty to really know and understand any issue a friend presents to me so that I can view the problem from all possible angles and give the best possible advice and alcoholism is something I have no experience in and cannot relate to. I've even tried in the past to get addicted to alcohol to better understand what its like however I don't have the genetic disposition for it to really happen. I understand some of you may either be in the same position as her father (drank all your life, multiple relapses, friends and family who enable) and Its a shit situation and would love to hear opinions from any of you who managed to claw your way out of that. I don't know if these are the right questions to ask or if this is the right place to ask it but I appreciate any insight and sources for more information you may have.",2

Not once in my lifetime have I seen my mom be continuously, and as drunk as she recently has been. My mom is 40, and her problem started when she started dating an alcoholic. It was made very clear that her boyfriend was, and has been an alcoholic for a long time when he moved in. I live with my two younger sisters, ages 11 & 3. When her boyfriend first moved in I was concerned with all of the alcohol in the house and how actively he was drinking throughout the day. He did sober up for a couple months as he went to jail, came back & told my mom he was going to stay sober.

This was not the case for long as I was finding shooters in my moms car (they share her car), in their room, in the freezer, in the trashcan, EVERYWHERE. About a couple months later, I notice my mom being drunk more and more. They would say they were going to the store and leave me with my sisters, and her boyfriend would bring my mom home ass drunk. Im talking to the point where she couldnt even get up the stairs by herself, puking everywhere, super disoriented, you know. Shortly after he would bring her home completely blacked out and close to unconscious, she started picking up the shooters and realizing her tolerance.

Almost everyday for about a month & 1/2 now she is drunk almost every single night. She makes super rude comments towards me and thinks its okay. Recently its gotten so bad to the point where I dont even know when shes drunk or not because shes starting to hold her liquor so well and be sneaky with it. I hate being home because shes such an asshole when she drinks and she makes the most outrageous, rude comments that a mother should not say to her daughter at all under any circumstances. I always say ‚Äúit‚Äôll be okay because I can move out in a couple months‚Äù but I worry so much about my younger siblings. What are they gonna do when im not there?

Any advice, any ways I can help her, or any thing would help. I have never delt with this before and I have no clue what to do.",11

My partner has been hiding drink and I found it. He‚Äôs agreed to get help with a counsellor. He‚Äôs been abusive, manipulative and generally a massive dick at times. He‚Äôs been tapering off the alcohol but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs doing it properly. He switched from a litre of vodka a day to beers, now he‚Äôs gone back to wine and I caught him sneaking my gin earlier and he got passive aggressive with me because he doesn‚Äôt believe I saw him when I did. 

He SWEARS the shitty behaviour is because of the drink. I know it‚Äôs hard and he‚Äôs been trying to self medicate for his hardships in life, but I‚Äôm sceptical lately and I wonder if it‚Äôs just him and he has a convenient excuse for his actions because he knows I care about him, and I‚Äôm all for talking about mental health.

Long story short he‚Äôs been verbally abusing me (though he won‚Äôt accept that‚Äôs what it is) by calling me awful names, dragging up my past and throwing me out depending on his mood. I‚Äôve lost count how many times I‚Äôve nearly gone back to my place, packing and unpacking my car. It‚Äôs humiliating and the neighbours notice too. 

He locked me out of his house when he told me to leave one day - because he was annoyed I left for a few hours for some space as a result? Yet he still wants me to move in? he also tried to blame me locking the door myself, but obviously not or id be able to unlock it...I‚Äôm sure he did it before too but he swears he didn‚Äôt, he just ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt realise you were in the garden. I locked the door and fell asleep‚Äù

He‚Äôs been more passive aggressive in general, mumbles shit I can‚Äôt understand at random points in the day but I still sense I should feel tense I guess? 
I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells and I don‚Äôt know if I wanna wait to see if he‚Äôs right that it‚Äôs the drink, or if I‚Äôm wasting my time

He cycles between massive apologies for his name calling, buying gifts, promising it won‚Äôt happen again and then tension building. I never know what I have done wrong, mainly because I haven‚Äôt fucking done anything wrong. He demanded I gave one gift back the other week because he perceives me as being annoyed with constant stress from him as ‚Äúnot accepting his apology therefore you cannot accept my gift so I‚Äôm getting a refund‚Äù which isn‚Äôt true. He bought a gift because he wanted to and he was sorry
One day. Then he did something else that was awful and then he tried to take it back? But then he gave me the gift back when he was in a better mood again...i feel exhausted 

Is this common in alcoholic people? Or is he abusive with the excuse of the alcohol problem?

EDIT: also he swears the tapering off has worked and he‚Äôs better now he has no withdrawal symptoms... except I caught him sneaking my gin today which caused him to be off with me.
He swears he‚Äôs not really like this and he will return to how he was when we first met but I‚Äôm sceptical",13

This may be a different post than what‚Äôs usually put on here and it may not be the right thing to put so if I‚Äôm miss using this r/ then I apologize.

I‚Äôm in college and I go out and party during the weekends I‚Äôm at school.

I‚Äôm a very chill drunk and on average I‚Äôd say I have 4ish drinks each weekend I go out. Sometimes more sometimes less but never too far overboard.

I always keep my focus on school and don‚Äôt act too much of a fool when I do go out so overall I have my priorities straight.

I just can‚Äôt shake this paranoid feeling that I‚Äôm drinking too much Bc I‚Äôll see articles out about liver/brain damage from binge drinking and alcoholism and all this other stuff that‚Äôs scary. 

This may sound like an incredibly dumb thing to ask but if I keep going like this each weekend (but take the summers off Bc I‚Äôm home) am I doing any damaging effects to my body? Or am I just being paranoid?

Sorry again if I miss used this r/ it‚Äôs just something on my mind and I felt I could get a reliable answer from here. Thanks in advance!",0

I lost my family in an accident 10 years ago. Because of that i started drinking. Nearly for 10 years i drink almost everyday. Since then I lost my friends, i lost my job, i lost all the good things in my life. I was in a good shape but then i started to get fat. 4 years ago i told my self to get in shape, quit smoking weed and stop alcohol. I started to go gym everyday. Run in forest, find new friends. Then i fall in love with a girl. When we started to dating i wasn't drinking. But after 1 month i started it again. I started to get fat again. I lost some of my friends, too because of my addiction. I behaved badly to my girlfriend. She begged me to see a doctor. Then i went the doctor. They gave me some pills and we started to theraphy. Everything was good. I was sober. My girlfriend graduated from university and we decided to move into a big city. And we found job over there. But then everything started again. I quit my job, behave bad to my girlfriend and started drinking. So she left me after a 3 years relationship. And now i am in the worst situation. I lost everything again. I was planning to marry her. But now she's gone. I drink 3 bottles of vines every single day. I call people and talk no sense. So they don't wanna talk with me again. Recently i made a scene in my apartment. Police came, we went to police station and this kind of embarrassing moments i experienced again and again. 

 I blackout on my couch last night and today when i woke up i was feeling awful. I was sweaty, had headache. And the tons of emberassing actions the last day i did, the messages, phone calls etc. And i decided to end this. Right now i am sober, i also installed an app that count your sober days. But i feel disgusting. So sometimes people decide something and they become happy or hopeful. I don't feel that. Maybe because 10 unsucessful attemps or maybe i lost all of my hope towards the life i really don't know. It scares me to leave the house. I think if i see someone who knows my emberassing actions i did. There is a gym at my building but i ashamed to go there for the same reason. But i need to go to a gym, i need new clothes, i need a job, i need friends and hopefully when i fixed up my appreance i need a girlfriend to fall in love again. Some times i consider to suicide. But i have cats and i love them more than everything. I know if i die nobody takes care of them. So this is not an option to me. 

I wonder what you suggest me. I don't want to go AA meetings in public. But i can join them online, so do you have any information about online AA meetings via Skype or Zoom? Maybe you are in one of it and you can suggest me it. Or what did you motivate when you were trying to quit? I don't know what to ask you but if there is something you think ""it will helps me"" and may ""make me smile again"" please say it.",4

Then I had 4,5 years of sobriety but eventually relapsed. It felt so good to get drunk with an almost zero amount of alcohol at the start. It took 5 years since that day and now I've become a ruin of a man, again. I get completely blazed for a week or more. At worst it took me two months once. I got dumped out of a plane before the departure once for being drunk, bought another one and the next day I got drunk while waiting and missed it. I've also lost a lot of money for sports betting, stock exchange, bitcoin and online poker. That's some examples of my miserable life. This year I was trying to limit the consumption. Guess I don't have to tell whether it worked out well. Recently I've become a young father and my wife... she gets through quite well, doesn't hate me and want me out of home, so I don't want to ruin everything eventually. She snores though so we sleep separately when we can and it was one of the reasons I got addicted again. Often I don't remember what happened last week at all.  I spend a lot of time at home fortunately. But still tell a lot of shit to my fri-  or family through the internet and then have to apologize another day.

&#x200B;

Sober three days now. I've decided, and I feel really motivated like never before, to quit again. Looking for any advice to keep myself sober. Also I wrote it here because I just felt like, even no one is ever going to read this. I don't have many friends, at least not some real friends, rather people who know me and write me once a year and make me feel nervous. My family is only, like, would like me to stop obviously, but they do the opposite, sometimes make jokes about my drinking, while I brag about being sober for 10 days. **I thought of some medicament/supplement for the start. Is there something worth the money?** I take magnesium, 5-htp, D3 now. I work out a little bit when I'm not drunk and taking cold showers only. I'm eating keto, even it boosts the hangovers actually. So I'm living extra healthy at times and totally unhealthy another time. I hope I can skip the AA. I've made it once without it. It's severer this time. I will just have a few changes, some supplements, or something else. I'm 100% devoted to quit it",9

I was afraid that I'd have to call the police, so I ran downstairs to defuse things before they escalated any further. It turns out that she smacked him (per his request), while they continued to yell at each other and me. I separated them both, told my dad how appreciated, loved, honored, and respected he is, then consoled my mom about how ""you shouldn't experience those things, you're our son."" Meanwhile my younger siblings are upstairs hearing everything but are unable to do anything about it. 

&#x200B;

After separating the two, I spoke with my dad, who has been dealing with an amalgam of horrible life events--the death of a parent, job difficulty, physical decline, social isolation. I'm just curious as to what the hell I should do next? Can I get someone's two-cents on the situation? What's happening? How do I fix it? What do I do to take care of myself? Of everyone else?",1

I (37F) haven't had a drink since Memorial Day (the end of my taper), and I'm starting to feel better.  However, my friend ""Amy"" came over today after her graveyard shift ended and she proceeded to get drunk, which quickly led to her becoming loud, obnoxious and making constant inappropriate remarks.  She had an extremely rough childhood (think incest and all kinds of abuse), so I do feel sorry for her.  My anxiety is stemming from the fear of my own feelings not being validated by my husband (I'm literally tearing up now as I'm typing this out) because my childhood wasn't nearly as traumatizing as hers was.  I'm afraid that if he (49M) sees me crying he'll get exasperated and ask me why I'm crying, as if I don't have a right to feel the way I do right now.

My dad is an alcoholic too, and I'm having some emotional flashbacks to the times when I would come home from school (or wherever) to him being drunk and me walking on eggshells around him.

Another reason why I'm so upset is because this is the first time that I truly saw things from the other (sober) side.  Like, was I that loud, obnoxious and inappropriate when I got drunk?  I already know the answer is yes.  It was eye-opening and ugly.  I don't think I have ever felt this strongly about getting and staying sober as I do now, and I was in rehab back in 2018.

I'm just going to sip on some herbal tea and then take a shower.  I hope I don't EVER forget what I experienced today.  Amy is no longer welcome in our home.",5

2020-06-05 10:56:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gx63bb/binge_drinking_depression_me/,"Binge drinking, depression & me","Hi All. I am new around here and looking for some advice . 

I am a weekend binge drinker. I am in my mid-thirties and binge drinking at the weekend seemed to be the norm growing up in the UK. However times have moved on and I am no longer a student or living a free and easy life. I have a young family that need me and a mortgage to pay. I thought the booze consumption would reduce as the party lifestyle turned into a family one, but this isnt the case. I have without fail got drunk every weekend for as long as I can remember, and dealt with the 2 or 3 day hangovers that have followed. 

My hangovers are deeply depressive with a dose of shame for good measure. I am unsure of whether alcohol was the cause, or whether it has only contributed, but I suffer from depression and anxiety. Alcohol seems to be my only escape from this so I turn to it at the weekend when my working week won't be affected. I can then go sober without issue until the following weekend when the cravings for a bit of happiness return. 

The thought of not having a decent drink on the weekend leaves me feeling flatter than ever. Life would be even more mundane without it. However I understand that the consequences of the drink are probably holding me back in my long standing pursuit of happiness. I have what I would guess are the typical tendancies for a binge drinker. Have one and thats it. Wont stop until I am blackout drunk. There is a fine line between drunk and fun me, and cant remember a thing arsehole me. This is the same whether I'm at home, pub with friends (or whats left of them) or even a meal with my parents. Most people know what to expect by now which I think has taken its toll on a few relationships. 

In an ideal world I would like to keep alcohol as part of my life because on some level it does bring me relief from my unhappiness. But on the other hand it may well be the cause of all my issues and never drinking again could make the depression disapear. I swing from one side of the argument to the other on a daily basis. 

Anyone with a similar story? Any advice welcome.",2

I have clinical depression and have since well before I abused alcohol (I'm 20), but lately I've found it easier when it comes to spiralling (and hangovers) by drinking weaker alcohol as an 'ease out'. I can function the next day much better after weaker drinks. 

I used to drink primarily Scrumpy Jack (my Mum's cider of choice) which is 6% alongside whatever strong stuff I could find on bad days. I recently switched to Thatchers Haze which is a lot lower, richer & sweeter and 4.5%. I seem to have more control with it.

Tonight my crate of Haze ran out and I opened a Scrumpy (my Mum has loads) and despite thinking I may go to bed soon and stop, one sip gave me a strange high.

Do others get this? I don't want to give up drinking but I want to learn moderation - I love drinking Scrumpy and have had a lot of great nights on it. My problem right now is that for a few hours it works way better than medication.

It's also really hard to stop drinking because the culture of my household (and peace of it) rests on everybody being somehow intoxicated; also they think their (our) habits are normal and healthy in this country.

I wish I could drink sensibly like my friends. I've always tried to stay away from spirits unless my depression is really bad because I've attempted to take my life whilst out of control on spirits a couple times before.

Honestly I wish I could drink my favourite drink without going extremely dark.

Kinda just asking for people to say 'same' tbh. I know I should just stop.

I have a couple people i know I talk to and an online anon group. I also just picked up the big book from AA. 

Nonetheless I am STRUGGLING. 

I am reading the big book and seeing the prayers and mantras. And while AA doesn‚Äôt say you have to believe in a certain God, it does put a lot of power into the concept of finding something greater than yourself you can trust to give you the strength you need (and don‚Äôt necessarily possess) to say No. 

I meditate daily and believe in the power of self actualization through wisdom. God could be that Wise self, Wise mind. But I have trouble giving myself to it. To me it is something I want to achieve more than something I can call up on the phone. Without a solid god concept that has power now‚Äîright now‚Äîhow can you lean on it? 

It‚Äôs like this separate struggle‚Äîthe struggle for guidance, meaning and purpose‚Äîhas been folded into what I considered a merely physical and mental addiction to alcohol. A metaphysical problem which lays glaringly unanswerable, spawned from a worldly one. 

I am an agnostic. For a long time I was atheist. I grew up in the Christian church and rejected it as it rejected me. I am a gender-non-conforming lesbian. I find the concept of organized religion, and by extension the concept of an all powerful God sickening. 

However I also know our brains are programmed to seek a higher power. Cognitive science backs up that we evolved to conceive God and it was *useful to us* it was beneficial! I see that in many stories of alcoholics. I even see it in Bills story the opening of the big book. But he just had a moment where it all made sense. He just *found his God* after a convo with a friend... not so for me thus far. 

I know I feel that missing piece. That emptiness. It‚Äôs what makes me doubt myself. What makes me feel worthless. What compels me to drink. To fill that hole and numb myself. When I drink I *trust alcohol so much more than I trust myself*. But I don‚Äôt trust much else. I want that power tho. I want the ability to achieve and be more than I ever thought possible as though a giant dude in the sky were giving me a leg up...

It‚Äôs hard. And maybe this is just me venting. But commiseration and advice welcomed.",9

I had to quit drinking years ago when i was 21 because of my life style. My doctor told me I had to quit immediately. I did so many blood tests, and liver scans. Sitting there scared for my life alone. Scared to tell anyone the details.
Lets back up a few months before that my cousin 29 years old i had to watch her die in person laying on her death bed with yellow skin and weight loss looking like a twig do to alcohol abuse

 
So I stopped for a years. Well needless to say i went back to drinking a few beers a week after my years of sobreity ( I've been 7 months sober no drinking at all right now). Nothing to crazy. This time when i quit drinking it was easier then ever. I am 24 now and I've lost many friendships, relationships, and more because of my drinking.
I would drink all the time because of the industry i was in (Music) i thought i had too. It felt weird going out to perform, do promos, meetings, etc while sober. It never felt right. It didnt feel right because i thought without booze and drugs whats the point of music and shows, and live entertainment.
When I had to quit alcohol I sat in my car everyday for hours crying thinking that my carrier and life was over. 
I thought my life was over because of my own stupidity and addictions.
I would sit in my car and say how am i suppose to be an artist / performer and be sober ? Like who the F can do that.
How am i suppose to be me? I never thought i would ever have the balls to quit shoving beers down my throat like an animal. 
I had to figure out how to stay sober on my own with no support because i was to embarrassed to go to AA at the time i was to embarrassed to tell anyone. 
So i had to figure out how to do my job sober while i had to watch my bestfriends party and drink on the side at shows and or what ever event it was, Shows, meetings, photo shoots, video shoots, etc. I had to fight these demons on my own, and i still fight them today. I am always surrounded by the devil himself wether it be drugs or alcohol.
Now people ask me how i do it ? How i stay sober for my music. People ask how i do my podcast because my podcast ""another booty lickin track""
Thats about partying days past and present, and stories from artist and life long friends. They hear these stories on the show and notice everyone is drinking on the show but me. They asl how do i handle that craving in my own studio with my life long friends / guests hashing out old and new stories. 


Well guys i haven't figured it out yet. I push everyday for it. My sobriety from drinking means everything to me.

Hi, so my mom was feeling very sick two days ago and went into a grand mal seizure. This is her third in the last 4 years. She didn‚Äôt get any sleep the night after, was vomiting, and couldn‚Äôt even keep water down.

I took her to the hospital yesterday and she went through testing. CAT scan and MRI came back fine. Apparently her electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and blood sugar was out of wack. Which I think is due to her alcoholism, and the fact that she doesn‚Äôt eat. Sometimes she‚Äôll have protein shakes but that‚Äôs it. I have to pretty much force feed her.

She stayed overnight and was supposed to come home today but is in detox. She called me last night saying she was having severe hallucinations and was scared. She called my dad this morning but it was nonsense talk, and she texted me something that didn‚Äôt make sense. I know it‚Äôs likely she‚Äôs having these delusions and hallucinations because of the detox, lack of sleep, and stress.
But I am worried.

I‚Äôve heard that going through this and detoxing can make people a shell of themselves. And that they are not the same when they return home. Is this true? 

She‚Äôs my best friend and it‚Äôs been really hard without her. I want her to get better and am very grateful she is getting the help she needs, but is she going to be different when she gets home?

It‚Äôs hard to not be able to visit, and talking to her is like talking to a stranger right now. Will this subside?

2020-06-04 02:26:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gwbut9/boyfriends_drinking/,Boyfriends drinking,"I get so concerned when my boyfriend drinks because he usually does it alone when he‚Äôs bored or anxious, and it‚Äôs a whole bottle of wine at once. He‚Äôs not a big guy and he‚Äôs on meds that increase the effects of alcohol. He disregards those facts when he says it‚Äôs just a bottle of wine. 

I‚Äôve heard that the bored/anxious/alone thing can lead to alcoholism so I encourage him to at least only drink once a week. And to handle his emotions/anxieties in other ways first before drinking so he learns actual coping skills. He follows these suggestions sometimes. He tried limiting a bottle spread out over the week once but was incapable of doing anything besides drinking the whole bottle at once. 

We‚Äôre in our 20s so it‚Äôs not that weird for someone to drink a bottle of wine once or twice a week, but it just seems like a future problem to me. It‚Äôs not a new problem it‚Äôs been like this for a couple years. Ever since he had a bad experience with getting stuck somewhere. 

He‚Äôs currently in therapy and exploring that topic and he got drunk to do his therapy homework of sitting with his past self that was stuck in a bad situation. He said he didn‚Äôt want to deal with thinking about it or his emotions otherwise and that he doesn‚Äôt regret it. It makes me worry because I don‚Äôt know if therapy will even be effective if he‚Äôs drunk doing it. Can you successfully process trauma while drunk? I don‚Äôt know and google can‚Äôt help me because it just spits out results about alcohol therapy.  

I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm under or overreacting. My extended family is largely alcoholics so I‚Äôve seen the damage it can do. But this seems less intense than that.",1

I hope this is okay to post here, I just need somewhere to talk about my concerns and if anyone has any, advice as to where to go from here if there is anywhere. 

My mother has had a poor relationship with alcohol since she was a young adult from what I've been told, but of course as a kid I didn't really see it until I was old enough to understand and when it got *really* bad. She is over 60 now and it's been over a decade since things took a turn for the worse. She's a binge drinker, and will go weeks or months drinking herself incoherent every day. She has destroyed every relationship she had, from friends to family. So, at this point it's just her kids and we still *want* to have some hope.

She has been hospitalized many times over the years and must be for detox. About 6 years ago she went to rehab but didnt stay for the entire program. She went home and drank for a month until she had a stroke and was found by one of my siblings. She nearly died, the doctors said her liver was shutting down and were preparing us for the worst. Luckily she recovered fully, however the doctor did tell us she suffered some brain damage. 

Since then there has been no major events, just the usual in and out of the hospital for detox. She continues with the same pattern, and it's just unbearable to watch. How many times can someone's child find their parent naked, passed out, covered in their own feces that's spread through the whole house? It's no way to live and my heart breaks for her, but I don't know what to do. I feel like we've tried everything through the years from trying to help, paying for rehab, being there for her and take the abuse she throws at us, to being distant and doing a tough love sort of thing. It doesn't matter whether we are there every day or disappear for months. 

Every time she ends up in the hospital and has some bloodwork done the doctor says they are concerned about her liver and want to do further testing. Unfortunately it never gets done because she only goes to the hospital when it's time to detox, so I'm not sure how concerned for her liver we should be. Obviously it's very damaged from the years of drinking, but I'm concerned about liver disease and liver cancer and to what extent.

I saw her recently for the first time in a few months. Her stomach has grown a lot more (the size has been pretty constant the last few years), though she is still very thin everywhere else. I know this is common with alcoholism but at what point does it become a concern? Her face and neck, which is usually very hollow looking, was extremely puffy/swollen looking and I'm not sure if that's to be concerned about or what's going on there. I'm not looking for medical advice, just voicing my worries, and maybe it's totally unrelated, I don't know.

Unfortunately a couple decades ago her brother was in the same boat and ended up committing suicide. I just don't want her to have the same ending.

I'm at a loss as to what to do. Is there anyone that has recovered from this point or know someone who has? What did it take?",5

2020-06-03 14:51:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gvzywp/help_with_my_husband/,Help with my husband," 

Hello everyone!

So my husband (24M) has been struggling with some questions for the last months/year...

I can't say much about how things were before we met, but since I came into his life (2 years today) it has always been really rough, in an emotional rollercoaster...

His problems are most with alcohol and cocaine (and benzodiazepines a bit less frequently).

When we met, he was already 10 months clean. He was even happy about it, tracking everyday and so on. He was in a very depressed mood generally (he suffers from depresion so it comes from time to time). I could watch the depresion developing on the next weeks. He was really bad. Then he started to say he wasn't being himself, that he needed friends to hang out (but actually he just wanted an excuse to drink), and even if he doesn't notice, he makes it seem that the only way he can be himself agai is by drinking. Some days later, the first relapse. He drank and used cocaine. For the following months, it happened a lot of times, always a different apology for it to have gone bad (like he wasnt feeling good, or the most stupid things, just not to admit he can't drink). He is not the kind who drinks every day, but when he does, it is a LOT. Always beer. He would spend the whole night drinking (and using some coke as well) and then feel bad the day after (and pretend nothing happened after that). One of the biggest problems is his ""will to take risks"" when drunk. He would do really dangerous things to get some drugs or to be able to drink more. Things escalated a lot after some episodes and he went to rehab. Spent less time there than he should, but he seemed to have changed how he felt about it. He was constantly saying he couldn't drink and stuff, but after some more time, all went back to ""normal"". He was feeling unhappy and could only be himself if drank. He was also always bragging about the fact that most people at the rehab used way much more than him and complaining that me and his doctor shouldn't have checked him in, that it was an exaggeration. He had some very bad episodes and went to rehab twice more (both times he was commited only 10% of the time he should). On the last time things went better. We decided to move out of town (he was afraid of being too close to drugs and alcohol here) and we were with his parents during the quarentine. Then he was depressed again, decided we wouldn't move out anymore and we went back to our old house. It lasted a bit more, but a couple weeks ago he started to drink again. Like always, too much. He didn't have drugs on the first time but I know he bought some on the second time and even after that he left at night to search somewhere to buy more drugs and only came back at dawn.

But he is a bit different now. He is not acting like his habits are dangerous (and he insists that his drinking habits are absolutely fine, always comparing to people he lived with, or even his family (that has a LOT of heavy alcoholism cases), saying that only the drug is the problem but, even after the last times when there was drugs involved, he didn't seem guilty. He makes jokes about it, always talks about drinking. He is obssessed with it. Even desperate to find some ""friends"" to go to their homes or have them here, because he just wants a reason to drink. I am constantly reporting to his psychiatrist, but I am also afraid of getting too involved in their doctor-pacient relation. I am trying to make he have an appoitment with the doctor quick (before things get too bad, again) but I am also afraid he will not be totally honest to the doctor and minimize things, because that doctor is really strict when it comes to his addictions, but the therapist always treated like it wasn't a big issue (everybody around my SO also said it almost looks like the therapist is encouraging his drinking since he neglects it a lot). The doctor told me he will recommend a change to a strict therapist that treats addiction, but I am afraid he will feel reluctant and won't even consider stopping from now.

What should I do? I already told him I won't be around when he drinks because I don't want it to look that I accept it and also to protect my own feelings. We argued a lot because of this. I don't know how things will go from here, I just want to be emotionally ""protected"" not to be shocked when things go wrong again.",1

2020-06-03 01:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/gvnxnr/friend_of_an_alcoholic_and_drug_user/,Friend of an Alcoholic and Drug User,"Hey everyone.  I figured I'd post here because I think I might be able to get some insight here.  I'm not an alcoholic myself but have a friend who is an alcoholic and drug user -- at least he was until about a week ago.  Last week after memorial day weekend, on Monday, I got a text message from my friend that made me breathe a sigh of relief -- my friend that I've been getting pretty close to since February let me know that he was taking  a step back and taking a break from drinking (and his daily cocaine use).  It was  huge relief because, while I did drink with him on occasion, his drug use and drinking were out of hand (I don't do drugs and never drank daily with him -- just had a few drinks with him about once a week).

However, something very odd happened, at least I think it's odd, but I suspect others here might have some insight into what may be going on.  He basically has stopped talking to me or wanting to hang out with me, even though I've encouraged him to not drink and offered for us to do things that didn't involve drinking.  In fact, after he told me he was cutting out the drinking/drugs, I said, well, let's try to grab dinner this week without drinking.  He replied ""I'd like that,"" but every time I've tried to reach out to him since then, he's avoided me or avoided meeting up.  He's going to the gym and doing other things, so I don't know if he's physically ill from ""withdrawals"")   His texts have changed in tone and and he barely communicates with me.  I'm trying to be understanding that he may be going through a lot, but I'd think that this would be the time for friends like me‚Äîwho aren't pushing drinking or drugs on him.  I don't want to make this about me, but I'm concerned for (1) him and (2) for our friendship - we've shared a lot with each other and grown VERY close over a very short period of time.

Now, I've heard people who stop drinking sometimes lose friends as the result of their not drinking, but I've never really heard of the reverse happening -- the supportive friend getting left in the cold.  So, my question to you is, does this sound familiar to anyone? Any suggestions on how I might be able to maintain this friendship and support him without being overbearing and nagging? Any insights into why this is happening or if this is a common thing would be really helpful.

Thanks!",2

Just feeling kinda depressed today, thought i'd just write some words to ya'll.  
sigh.  Gonna make it to my 28 days, which is this coming Sunday.  But man do I want to drink again.  It makes things worse, for sure, but it also hides a bunch of stuff, which was nice.  Like... ""The Matrix"" nice.   The hangovers, less productivity at work, crippling anxiety, fear of the future, lack of deep sleep, lost time, destruction of my liver, destruction of my wallet, never knowing what ""crazy"" thing i might do next when drunk... ufda... yeah it's just not worth it.  Plus, my kid is going to have special needs whether or not I'm drinking.   I'm trying to take the mask off and face this shit like a responsible adult.  I have to do this.  I can't go back, as much as I want to.",25
