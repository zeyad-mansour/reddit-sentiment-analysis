The second I get better with mental health another problem comes up, this time it's the excessive drinking.  Been drinking for 4 days in a row now, just long drinks and they vary from small to bigger amounts. I have no idea why I do it, guess it's the only thing in my life right now at least. (Though I drank when I was suicidal and went to a psych ward for a few days too, so i guess it doesn't really matter.)

The thing is, alcohol only makes my depression worse, been like this all summer. I hate myself. I look old and fat as hell. I don't have the guts in me to just stop this. I know it's very unhealthy and in my case even dangerous, my family history has a lot of alcoholics so it's pretty possible that i carry that trait too. I use medications that are deemed to be harmful with alcohol. (in my country at least they are called Ketipinor and Voxra. Ketipinor for my insomnia, Voxra for my depression.) And to be honest, i don't really care if I die from it. Probably not, most likely my liver will give up before that. I have this ridiculous inclination to self harm.

I just feel this terrible guilt from this situation. At least I can say it out loud, not hiding it.",6

We are both in our 30s. He has been an alcoholic for what I have been told for about 10 years. He kept his drinking problem a secret for the first few months of dating. He has tried quitting about 4 times from then to present. We have been doing end-of-life care for his grandparents for several yrs now, and he tells me that drinking makes it easier for him to cope with life atm. So I feel for him, he is clearly depressed. I love him dearly, but I have noticed lately that his drinking is getting worse, and he has seemed emotionally detached from our relationship. He sometimes says hurtful things when he is drunk and never acknowledges it or apologizes. Every time I try to talk to him about it he dismisses me, and it is impossible to talk without him getting defensive or turning it around. I need advice as to how to go about talking to him. How do you get through to an alcoholic that you love and care for without fighting or being dismissed?",7

The pandemic and lockdowns have been a huge trigger for me, suffering from PTSD due to being raised in a cult. I spent most of the last 12 months drunk or hungover. So I recently bit the bullet and got sober, I had a couple of set backs but pretty much dry for over a month. This weekend just gone I have been at a festival and slipped right back into heavy drinking in the evenings. I spent the days running workshops, but this time it was different. I noticed how shit the drinking made me feel now that I have had the contrast of being sober for a month. For anyone here thinking of quitting the drink I would encourage you to do so, I did not realise how much alcohol was impacting on my ability to function. Feeling rough, groggy, tired and not being able to think straight had become my normal. Not anymore, I'm done.

2021-08-30 14:31:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/peo2vm/definitely_not_an_alcoholic_yet_but_wondering_if/,"Definitely not an alcoholic yet, but wondering if I have the early warning signs?","So, before about a year ago, I never drank at all (I’m 25, for reference).  I wasn’t opposed to it, I just figured it wasn’t for me.  Last year though, I started drinking beers; not obsessively, just as a casual thing at family parties or whatever, or maybe once a week after dinner or something.  Over the course of the year though, I’m a little worried that I’ve started exhibiting VERY early signs of addiction.

Over the course of the year, I started drinking more frequently, and in higher alcohol contents.  Never excessively, and I still have never actually gotten drunk yet.  But 1 beer every two weeks or so went to 1 beer every 3 or 4 days, and then down to maybe every 2 or 3 days.  I started thinking about it a lot more during the day, and wanting to just get through until the evening so I could grab a beer.  It never impacted my daily life, but it was like this little nagging feeling in the back of my head.  By this past summer, I found myself trying to “subtly” propose places to eat while out with friends that I knew had alcohol I liked, and every once and a while I’d grab a beer from the fridge at home and sneak it up to my room at 2 or 3 pm (I lived with my parents up until a week or so ago, and I guess I just didn’t want them to think I was drinking too much).

Last week, I moved to a different city for graduate school, and I’m living in a studio apartment.  I made sure to stock up on beer and liquor, and over the past week I’ve been drinking something every single night in my apartment (alone); mostly, I’m just wanting to try the different liquors I bought, since I’d never had most of them before, but still, it’s been almost every night.  

Like I said above, I’ve never gotten drunk, and it hasn’t had a negative impact on any relationships or on grad school at all.  But I’m still worried that I might be more susceptible to alcoholism than most other people I know - there is a history of alcoholism in the males on my mom’s side of the family (the Irish side, ironically), and I wonder if that could also explain my unusually high tolerance for alcohol compared to most of my friends (my grandfather could drink upwards of 6-8 beers a day and not be visibly drunk).  I do remember earlier this summer telling my self I’d only drink on Fridays and Saturdays, but within a month I was more or less off of that and drinking on any night I pleased.

Any advice/opinions/tips?  I enjoy drinking socially, and I like the taste, but I definitely want to know if I should be more cautious about drinking than I have been so far.

Thanks!",6

He ripped his IVs out several times and tried to leave the room as a result of his hallucinations. This all occurred the day before he was released.  His parents, my husband, and I all agreed that this hospitalization is the push he needs to get sober once and for all. We rid the house of any alcohol and prepared for his discharge. Since he’s been home, the delirium has not gone away. He’s been sober for exactly 1 week today, and he has barley slept and he is having insane hallucinations.

I pretty much lose control after I have a certain amount and usually end up not fully blacking out but usually have a fuzzy memory on the events from the night before. 

I don’t drink at home on my own often, but when I do I usually cut out at about 2 or 3. Most of the time when I “have one too many” is in a binge drinking environment like clubs or a party where people are playing drinking games, although sometimes I get more drunk than I intend to at more low key events. 

Right now on average, I probably casually drink like 1-2 nights a week and party 1-2 nights a week. Both my parents have had issues with alcohol as well with my mom being an alcoholic—so I feel I do have the gene. 

It’s never really affected my life too much in terms of my school/career/relationships. There have been few instances where I owed people apologies, but for the most part it does not really affect other areas of my life. Recently I just got out of long-term relationship so I am finding myself wanting to go out drink with friends more than ever. I just want to socialize and enjoy some new freedom and try to get the relationship off my mind, but appears it could be a potential issue if I don’t put my guard up. As a 23 year old  I feel much of a social life is centered around alcohol so I really don’t want to have to cut off completely, but realize I may need to if I don’t watch myself more. 

Does anyone have any strategies they use to make sure they stay in moderation? Should I consider giving it up all together or am I still at the point where coming up with a plan to make sure I moderate it will be fine? Thanks in advance!",2

Unnecessary info: I had headache, he got upset why I am always like this,  boring, and finding excuse not to drink.

Usually he doesn't have fun when we go out for food or coffee. He is pretty direct about this.

Also, he gets very rude when he s drunk and I happen to disagree about something, even minor.

Anyway, we went to this bar. 

I think he got affected by alcohol and decided to ride a bycicle.

I told him its not safe, we are tipsy. He started fighting. Went out, don't know there tf he went with bycicle.

She won't tell me anything and insists she's trying. (Is still drinking at least once a week, which is better but she went 2 years without on pure will so...)

Next thing I know she's calling me unsupportive and any example of being supportive (driving her when she had no license, being there for every court date she would let me, visiting her as much as possible while she was in prison, answering every call while at the in patient program, helping her while sick (normal non alcohol stuff), etc) I bring up is me being supportive of me, not her.

So, she wants me to be supportive but won't tell me how. She wants me to see that she's trying but won't tell me anything she's doing to help herself without us being in a huge fight and using it as defense and even saying that I dont even know the things she's doing to work on it. She won't tell me anything. 

Supposedly she won't tell me because I will flip out. Well, yeah, 4 years ago I did do that a bit because this is huge stuff I had no experience with and it freaked me out. She has told me things recently and I didn't flip out. But because I did before thats it. Never again. Cause maybe I've grown up a bit in the past several years having to deal with all this s***.

There really wasn't any significantly noticeable impacts. I'm in a successful relationship, successful career, relatively fit (no problem heading out and walking 10 miles), active, not overweight, etc.. 

The pandemic has not been good for me at all, especially working from home. Easier to drink right after work v. heading to the gym after work or working late. 

It's easy for me to discount aches and pains to this or that due to some underlying back issues and past injuries.  Recently I've been noticing a dull, consistent, slight burning pain under my right rib cage (front and back), a little pain under the rear of my right shoulder, what feels like some abdominal bloating, and a general sense of fatigue. My diet has been anything but disciplined. I usually experience some slight nausea in the morning, but it quickly passes and I've attributed that to coffee on an empty stomach. 

The pain under the ribs concerns me as does the perceived bloating. Seems to be a pretty textbook liver issue but I don't want to avoid self diagnosis. I have always been able to overlook things because I get regular physical exams and blood work, donate blood, etc. ALT tests always come back fine. There's some other reason.

I also believe I've noticed some decline in my cognitive processes. I'm getting a little older and understand some of this is normal, but I find myself search for the right word that I should definitely be immediately accessible. Recollection is not what it once was. My vision has declined a bit making reading a little more challenging, but again, this happens with age is what I tell myself or that these things are a result of poor sleep. I'm fatigued quite a bit but still manage to exercise regularly. I do find that some of the activities I would partake in during the early morning or night time hours have dropped off.

So, I'm not sure exactly what the message here is other then I really enjoy the habit of drinking, I know it's bad for me, and I've become concerned about some signals my body is putting out that I am having a much harder time writing off as this or that. I'm interested in hearing if others may have had these symptoms, what they might be, what the future beholds. I believe a change is necessary though, and quite honestly I'm somewhat afraid for that to realize.

I did message my Dr. this morning to hopefully discuss the abdominal pain.",6

[First note, as per the rules, I am 100% sober writing this].

I went through a separation (and soon divorce) of a 20 year long marriage. Lost my wife, house, job, physical access to my son, and 6 pets (birds/dogs/cats), all in one instant. This was due to drug abuse (not alcohol, much harder things).

I cleaned myself up off all the drugs immediately, but the damage was already done. My way of life was destroyed, and everything I had built over 20 years of work, was gone. At more than 40 years old now, I ended up moving in with my parents, and staying in their house for the next couple of years. 

I turned to alcohol to get me through the days. At first, it was just light beers, or whiteclaws. Then eventually it was Tequilla and Vodka mixed with juice of some kind. 

I would eventually over the course of two years, find myself drinking all day, and all night. And over the course of the following year, drinking even more. 

About two months ago, things took a turn for the worst, and I was drinking Vodka 24/7. About a shot an hour, every hour, all day, all night, and all through my sleep. I would literally wake up once an hour due to complete insomnia, take another shot, and pass out again. After 10 hours of sleeping, I'd have done 10 shots. Then continue through the day. My long distance vision, which was always sharp, suddenly was very blurry. I could see up close fine, but far away was horrible and squinting my eyes didn't help. I at the time chalked it up to old age, and didn't consider it was from the alcohol. 

Then one morning, I woke up, went to get my shot of vodka, and saw something strange. There was a spider-web stuck to my arm. I swiped at it with my other hand, to get rid of it, and that's when a look of horror came across my face... There was no spider-web, I was hallucinating. For the next two weeks, in the mornings, and at night, whenever I moved my left or right arms/hands through the air, a ghostly perfect outline trail that looked like it was made of spider webs would follow my hand about 1 second delayed. There was only ONE ghostly outline trail, not many. This wasn't like trails you might see on LSD where it's your hand trailing like a snapshot or blur, no. This was a single ghostly spider-web outline of a hand trailing my hand 1 second in delay as I moved it through the air. 

It was both kind of cool on a deranged level, as I didn't know the human mind could produce this kind of visual disturbance, but also it was very scary because it made me feel like something was deeply wrong.

Then, after about two weeks of this, I remember waking up in the morning, laying there with my eyes closed when suddenly my mother bursts into my room, and says ""Hey, are you ready now to go to the hospital?"". It scared the shit out of me, like in a startling way and I suddenly thought, ""what the hell, no I am not going to any hospital I am fine"", and then I sat up in bed, looked towards the door where she came in, and... Nothing. She wasn't there. She didn't come into the room. I hallucinated it completely. It was so real, and nothing like that happened to me ever before. 

After some contemplation about this, I laughed it off, but now in hindsight, I could see it was some kind of higher power or deep inner knowing warning me of what was about to happen. 

Another week goes by and it was time for my brother and I to take a road-trip across country so I could get some things out of storage. I proceeded to take Gatorade bottles, dump some out, then fill the rest of the empty space back up with Vodka. This was so I could drink in the car on the road-trip, and he wouldn't be any wiser. I was hiding my alcoholism from him from my sense of deep shame and embarrassment. 

Then, the first night in the hotel, we each had our own room, and I over-did it. I got the bottle of Vodka out of my suitcase that I brought, and proceeded to do my shots to get to bed. The ghost trails were everywhere. It looked like spider-webs were attached to my arms and then suddenly I kept hearing people talking in the room with me. I would spin around and look, and no one was there. Then someone would call my name again behind me, of which I would spin around and no one was there. 

I suddenly started having massive muscle cramps, all through my body. My legs were locked up, my kidneys hurt. A voice in my head kept saying ""You're going to die now, it is time."". I'm drenched in sweat, and I stink a foul disgusting scent as the alcohol is just permeating my skin. Eventually I pass out. 

The next day, I wake up, do a few more shots, see the spiderweb trails again and I begin to finally realize, I am going to die if I don't stop drinking. So I decide I am done and didn't drink any alcohol all day on the next leg of the road-trip. 

I am feeling pretty good, and that night we check into the hotel and it's about 10:30pm. I take the vodka from my suitcases and dump them down the sink. I empty the Gatorade bottles, and dump them down the sink. Then I try to get ready for bed. 

As midnight approaches, I notice I am getting extremely anxious. It has been about 12 hours since my last drink and I feel like I am jumping out of my skin. I feel very dehydrated and the audio hallucinations are back. I keep hearing, ""It is time to go to the hospital"" from both inside my head and from imaginary people who aren't in the room with me. Then I realized that the hallucination of my mom coming into the room in the morning waking me up asking if I was ready to go to the hospital, wasn't just a hallucination, it was a premonition. 

The voice says again, ""You're about to die, are you ready?"". I start panicking, thinking ""no, no no!!"". It's about midnight and I start packing up my room so I could go to the hospital. The whole time, this voice keeps saying ""Time for the hospital and you are going to SUFFER"". It takes me about 30 minutes and everything is ready to go, but I am frozen... I feel like I can't move.  I feel incredible anxiety and like I am jumping out of my skin. 

I decide to go to the bathroom, and I go to pee in the toilet and it BURNS. The pain was incredible. It felt like I was pissing straight vodka. I again panicked more. I tried to fold the toilet paper to wipe my butt and I was shaking so bad that I could barely do it. My hands were like I had Parkinson's disease. I then looked up online quitting alcohol, and that's when I learned you can't just quit cold-turkey and you can easily die if you try. 

I start chugging water so that I can try to pee without it burning. And then I realized, my brother has some alcohol in his hotel room. I started banging on his door at nearly 2am, wake him up and get the alcohol from him. He hands me the beer and I go back into my room. 

I decided, I either have to taper right now, or I have to go to the hospital. I decided to taper as the idea of going to the hospital in the state I was in, felt like it would be pure torture. I know this was stupid, I was risking my life. 

So I set a timer on my phone, and only allowed myself 1/2 a can of beer every hour. I drank that first 1/2 can, and my anxiety and ""feeling like jumping out of my skin"" instantly subsided. I felt calm again. I then waited, an hour, and drank another half. The next morning, I broke down in the car crying and told my younger brother that I was an alcoholic. I told him about my plan to try to taper, and he lovingly supported me. Every few hours, we'd pull over and I'd have a beer, then we'd get back on the road. 

Two days later, the spider-web ghost trails stopped and my long-distance vision suddenly returned. I could see again! And no more trails! 

I drank less and less over the next few weeks, eventually switching to ultra-light beer, and in the last few weeks only drinking right before bed, not at all during the day. 

Last night (24 hours ago) was my last time I drank 3 to 4 ultra-light beers (4.2%ABV) around 10pm through 1am or so when I went to sleep and one ultra light beer in the middle of the night.  I didn't drink at all when I woke up or during the day. While my mood isn't the best during the day, it is pretty good and I don't think about alcohol all day long now.

Since I feel pretty clear headed all day, and my desire to drink is nearly gone, I am officially quitting now now. If I feel too anxious or panicky again I will re-evaulate, but I don't think that will happen.

I feel really good about being completely sober now. Tonight, I'll go to bed without drinking. I'll keep an eye on how I feel to make sure I don't get into any sense of trouble. 

That was close... I am glad I didn't die, and glad I hit that rock-bottom to quit. I thank god for those voices that scared the shit out of me, for they saved my life. I am really excited to get completely sober, get all my energy back, stable mood, and my old-self of who I was prior to this 20 year marriage falling apart.

If I need it, I'll see a doctor, or go to AA. Since I've been doing so well I am going to give myself a shot here first. And if I can't do it, I'll get more help. I told my brother about my problem since then, and he's also keeping an eye on me and supporting me. I'll also let my doctor know that I went through and have him run liver-tests etc...",47

I have developed a problem with alcohol the past year. I used to be drunk off of two drinks/half a bottle of wine- now I can drink 2 to 3. I can take short breaks, or drink a glass a night as a ‘break’, but I end up binge drinking. Recently, I’ve been blacking out a lot. I struggle to stop myself from over drinking. I live with housemates, I’ve drunk their alcohol on a few occasions now and replaced immediately, but that’s a line I never would of crossed even a few months ago! 
I’m aware of all my past trauma, and why that may contribute towards my drinking. However, I feel completely in the dark about why I am drinking now. I have friends, a job, good family etc. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Perhaps I’m repressing current negative emotions with drink. I just know when I’m sober, I’m overwhelmed with anxiety and feel terrible.",3

It's all part of being a drunk.

I used to drink and drive all the time.  One time I found a quarter pounder between the drivers seat and front door about a month after I bought it at the drive-thru of McDonalds- totally uneaten and still neatly wrapped.

The worst thing that happened though was I went out in the country one night when it was about -10 F and thought it'd be fun to drive in the snow-filled ditches.  It was new years eve 1990.  I was TOTALLY drunk.

Well, I got stuck of course, and had a flannel shirt and jeans on and a denim jacket and the wind chill was about -40.  Nearest house about a mile away.  Was anybody home?  Would they help me?  Would I freeze to death on the way there?  I had a little bit of gas and I thought about just sitting there with the car running hoping I wouldn't pass out.. die of carbon monoxide poisoning.. get a DUI from a passing county cop.. so I got out and cleared the snow from the exhaust pipe and sat there for a while.  Then I thought.. fuck this..

I went for it.  Ran to the house, the guy let me in to use the phone thank God.  He was like ""oh MAN you're DRUNK AS FUCK"" I was embarrassed as hell and was melting snow all over his kitchen floor and using all his paper towels to clean it up.  His dog just looked at me funny the whole time.   I thanked them for saving my life.. because I'm pretty sure I would not have made it back to the car.

So my Mom came and got me.    Thought I'd share that one.

Anybody else have any shameful stories they'd like to share?  Might be good to get it out- confession time!  :-)  Or just cathartic maybe.",7

He’s drank heavily for 9 years, he’s absolutely tiny and takes antidepressents which greatly increase the effects of the alcohol (i’ve seen him pass out unexpectedly twice from a very small amount of alcohol, once outside and it was terrifying). I don’t see him very often because he doesnt live here, but when i hear from him he will always ask me the same questions. Not just general questions, specific questions about specific friends or family members that we’ve had full discussions about in the past, and explained why i havent been friends with these people for years (he also always brings up a family member that abused me and asks how he is… awkward) (he also kept asking my friend about their dead dog over and over again just after the dog passed away). With not seeing him much I can’t really imagine what it’s like on a daily basis because he genuinely forgets so much.

After about the 7th time of him asking, I sort of gave up in sadness and just said to him, “we have had this conversation many times”. And he just laughed it off. He hates the spotlight being on him so it’s very hard to address my concerns without pushing him away. But i’m so worried about him. He doesn’t really have proper family and his girlfriend is also in a really bad way, often dissappears on nights out and passes out in a club or alleyways, thank god nothing has happened to her or him.

I went through a bad break up and started immediately to drown my sorrows in you know what. I’m over 30 and had a seizure not even two years ago because of this garbage and idk what to do. 


I think I’m going to hike up to the local e.r tomorrow to see if they’ll treat me because I can’t go on like this. I don’t want to die of this, I have kids and most people I know think I’m a stand up guy but I drink around the clock randomly every few months for some freaking reason. I can’t afford to take 5 days off to go to med detox again but I’m so ashamed because I just did this a few months ago. Sucks man. I know my wd are bad enough to get medical care, I wake up shaking and if I don’t have one or two by 10am I’m an absolute mess. Bad news. 


Idk what I’m looking for, I guess I just want to vent and some support because I know it’s going to suck but I’m so sick of being sick. I don’t think I’ve even been fully drunk in weeks, just constantly trying to taper and trying not to be sick, it’s exhausting. I fight like hell but always seem to end up like this after a few months. Wish me luck guys, I hope they treat me at the hospital because I can’t afford a ride to the local med detox and it’s a rough spot to be in. Hope you guys are doing better.


Edit: just wanted to update for anyone interested in how this turned out. Went to the local e.r and they knocked me out with intravenous Ativan and then dosed me for Librium for the rest of the day. They told me they didn’t have the bed or facility to keep me there and contacted someone to help me fins an inpatient, also wrote me a small script for Librium to hold me over in case it took a few days. I got into an awesome place that took state insurance, I’ve been to a dozen med detoxes and this place was tops. 


They did the whole med detox thing over 4-5 days while setting me up with a dual diagnostic therapist who I’ll start seeing on Monday. Still feeling the typical post serious detox paws effects but they gave me comfort meds for sleep and blood pressure etc. thanks for all the support and encouragement, it meant a lot because as we all know detox sucks and it’s a hard decision to make, you basically have to go through torture regardless of the meds and no one likes that lol. Thanks everyone you all helped and I’m stoked to be clean and sober and to be able to get into a psychologist and start gaining my self respect and my families trust again. You guys rock.",11

****So what am I talking about?****
 I'm working from home. In the garage.  Have the laptop open and on work calls all day w/the garage door open. Sun shining. Every now and again the idea of a cold beer would pop up into my head.  Or a tall glass of vodka soda with ice.  Started making promises that'll be for this week of work during these hot days. Got in my car. Drove over to liquor store. Part of my brain knew I had a good streak going.  Same part of my brain knew I'd feel damn good about myself if I did not come home with a car filled with new bottles to keep me company for about a day.  Because I'd go through those bottles quickly.


I knew I needed to just get my body away from the store. Decided to get milk for my kid. Got it. Saw case upon case of hard seltzer. Beer. Started negotiating with myself. 'Okay no hard liquor. I'll do some spiked seltzer. that's better.'. I was very close.  Again, my brain jumped in. This time screaming 'just move away from these racks of booze'.  Took one step say.  Then another. Got to the register, paid for my milk and made it out.  

Loud exhale. A fleeting thought to go into the liquor store as originally planned came in and went as my body automatically beelined to my car and started it.  Made it back home.  Relief washed over me as I kept driving away.  

No regrets at this hour for the lack of booze in the house. Just relief.  I'm expecting another nagging tomorrow. I'm suspecting I might even take a ride again. But I'm hoping I hold onto today and walk away again.",39

I'm struggling with my emotions and am trying to find support.  On one hand I miss her like crazy but I know that she is exactly where she needs to be to heal and I pray that she is able to so my heart is happy.  On the other I keep flashing back to what happened and I don't know what to do, it feels overwhelming and I have moments where I feel like I'm having an anxiety attack and need to control my breathing.  It was A LOT and for the most part I was the only one there with her going through the process.  I feel the need to talk to others about my experience but this is her life and I don't want to expose that until she is ready to do so herself.",2

Today was my fibroscan. The findings are consistent with cirrhosis, with my CAP (fatty liver) score being the highest it can be. I immediately jumped to google and the estimations of life expectancy are… terrifying. 

I don’t know what to do. I am 33 and I feel like I have just been given a death sentence. And all I can feel is shame that I did this to myself.

One of the ones I find myself using is, ""I don't want to go cold turkey, I better have another smaller drink instead of stopping completely."" While going cold turkey certainly does suck ass, it's become clear to me that I can't be trusted to stop even after I've tapered to only one or two drinks a night. I have to just stop, full-stop.

Edited to say, thank you to everyone, I've read every single comment and seen a lot of my own excuses or reasons reflected back at me. It's very heartening to see that we all tell ourselves the same things, it somehow makes it easier to deal with. I guess it's comforting to see that my thought processes aren't somehow alien or disfigured, they're just the same thought processes everyone who struggles with alcohol has.

He’s been sober for about two years now, but I can’t recall ever having sat down and talked with him about that period in our lives.
I don’t even know if it’s okay to talk about, but it’s a weighted feeling I carry around that still effects me to this day.


Taking care of him through his alcoholism was an extremely exhausting, isolating experience. Because we’re young, I couldn’t find support from our friends and family. I was constantly told that young people drink heavily, that it was normal. That I was overreacting. But he was physically hurting himself. 


His employment was always jeopardized. There were endless nights where I couldn’t sleep because I’d be out looking for him. His friends used to encourage him out to go drinking, then leave him. Just watching him be sick all the time, then claim he’d never drink again, only to go out that night and do it all over again broke me. The financial burden of being the only partner with a consistent job was overwhelming. He was never abusive towards me, but I felt more like a caregiver than a partner.


If I’m being honest, a lot of the anxiety/depression I experience now stems from that period in our lives. I don’t know why I chose to stay through all that, but there’s been times I feel angry that I did. I feel like I have no energy anymore. There were a lot of goals I had at that period in time that I put on hold, because taking care of him became priority. Even with him sober now, my energy feels spent. I feel like I don’t have any fight left in me to WANT anything else out of life. 


We’ve had a few small conversations about this alcoholism, but I feel afraid to admit how I truly feel because I’m worried it will make him turn to drinking again. Or even if we do talk about the impact of his alcoholism, I’m afraid it won’t get rid of my feelings of resentment, or change how I feel about the future. I’m not sure what I want to do now, or what I want out of our relationship, or if there’s something I need to see or hear from him to make me feel any different.",7

Then one turned into two, which turned into seven or eight and a pack and a half of cigarettes. I’m not too hungover, surprisingly, but I definitely don’t feel good.

It was stupid, but my original plan was to only drink while out to lunch. My wife and I agreed to up to three. I only had one because she wasn’t feeling well. So, we agreed I could have more at home where I went overboard.

Fortunately, while drunk I suggested we start a D&D campaign so yay for sober activities. This week I’m going to try to make a plan to fill my after work time with activities, both responsible and fun. Also, messaging friends while sober that only hear from me when I’m drunk.

I kinda feel like drunk me knows her days are numbered and is almost helping to lay a foundation for me forging ahead without her. Last night I didn’t put up much of a fight when my wife asked me to stop. I realized while drunk that I wasn’t enjoying myself and wished I could sober up faster.

So, today is a new day with new plans for keeping the alcohol at bay. But should I take the Abilify? I’m only on half pills and just started a few days ago. I’m just worried it’ll make me sick and I have to work today.",2

First of all, thank you for all your responses. They have been supportive and very very informative and in a scary time, I really appreciate it.

 I'll try to keep it short.

After our discussion, I went for tapering and kept to two drinks hydrated almost 80/90 and I also got some bland food and some soup for dinner.  Even if I couldn't finish the entire thing it managed to stay in me.

I did get close to puking all over again a couple more times but that wasn't anywhere near what I had in the morning. I was being cautious still so I was a bit worried that the day is going to repeat tomorrow. 

It didn't. I woke up feeling pretty much fine apart from a little grogginess.

Didn't sleep much though, and I was not feeling any knots in my stomach or any more nausea and I could drink more water than a couple of hours back.

But I did make the mistake of pushing my breakfast a bit too late and the knots returned. I did eat a regular meal after almost three days and played with my dog after a while. No puking, no knots.

And the shivers I'm pretty sure are just cold shivers cus I just started sniffling around an hour back before I type this.

Now I'm not sure if it was solely because I started tapering and my body is just reacting to it, but it also could be me coming down with the flu and my abuse just kicked it up to 1000.

Nonetheless, I still remember what I went through, and just as a safety net I'm still going with soup and crackers for dinner with two drinks instead of three and keep rehydrating until I start feeling my mouth not feel like sandpaper. 

I've also booked a consult with my doc and we'll get to know if it's cold or Withdrawal.

I'm feeling a little feverish too but it's not alien or severe as what I saw with DT shakes. 

Here's what worked for me.

Gatorade, Bread, Crackers, Soup (Tomato and Clear onion), Rice with a small portion of veggies, and Yogurt for lunch, and lots of water. This helped me clear the dehydration pretty much by the day.  I also took some ibuprofen for the fever.

Thank you so much for helping me out and I'm planning on being part of this community to help in anyway I can.

**Old Post (22/08)**

Hi, 23 years old. Been drinking for the past 9 months almost every day.

I did have to stop from May to Mid-July as I'd had been living with my parents and couldn't drink.

Now back to my issue. I went on a drinking binge from last Friday to culminating yesterday night.

I drank anywhere from 1/4 liter to Full depending on how much awake I was. And to add more I barely ate anything during this period. I drank dark rum with 75 proof mixed with Gatorade.

Now since last night, my stomach's been fucked. I can't hold a drop of water or even plain bread inside and if I take some time to rest, bile builds up and I'm throwing up again.

I'm pretty sure this started out a day or two before but I was too hazed to notice.

So my entire day has been a rinse and repeat of trying to drink small gulps of water and food. I'm feeling a lot hydrated but I still issue with food or even swallowing at a normal pace.

And my brains have been fucked too. Shivers and nausea with dizziness.

A couple of hours back I finally caved and had a finger of rum with loads of Gatorade mixed. Even most of that got out I'd been feeling a bit better.

I'm not sure if I should drink a bit more or just play out and see how it goes.",20

2021-08-22 08:28:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/p9blic/still_an_alcoholic/,Still an alcoholic.,"At 21 years old I admitted to myself that I was powerless over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable. It was time to embark on my journey of sobriety if I wanted to live. I did. It lasted the better part of 20 years. Until it didn’t. 

My relapse began in my early 40’s and lasted almost 4 years. 😞 I have now been gratefully sober for a little over 2 years. I’m 48 years old. 

That 4ish? year relapse almost killed me, and definitely killed every important relationship I had. This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction. Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices.

I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does. (Yes, it’s a disease) The almost 20 years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up, even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt. I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink. 😞 My disease was far worse than it was in my 20s almost immediately. 😞

I’m STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost. I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly - I want the world to see that I’m trying, I’m working, I’m doing everything I can to just do the next right thing - and this shit is HARD!!!! 
Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished, is fucking hard! But, I wake up each day determined to keep doing the next right thing, and no matter what, I don’t take a drink. When life gets too lifey, I now have healthy tools and resources to utilize, that get me through the moment.

I am Michelle. I’m a wife, a daughter, a sister and a mother and I’m an alcoholic in recovery, recovering publicly and loudly for all to hear and see in hopes of saving one person from having to go through some of this shit, or of helping someone who’s currently in it. You can do this!

All of this is shared with love. I always hope my words help someone, but ultimately I am the one who benefits the most from sharing my experience, strength and hope. 
For that I am so very grateful.",19

i have no idea what to do to help her. my dad seems complacent and like he doesn’t really care and only cares when it becomes inconvenient for him. my brother is really young and i can see how confusing and sad it is for him to see her like this. in 6 months i’m going to move out more permanently and i know once i go i think my parents will split up more officially and i’m worried she will not do well on her own and i want her to start doing something about it now because i’m really concerned about her health. do i encourage her to see a doctor? go to AA? get a therapist? i’m worried she will strike down any suggestion i have and get really upset at me. i have pretty terrible anxiety and i cant handle confrontation well.

i know you all must have had a million stories like this but if you read the whole thing and have any advice at all especially if you know how to deal with a personality like this please let me know. i don’t want to give up on her like i think everyone else has.

tldr. how do i help my narcissistic mother stop drinking 2 bottles of wine a day because i’m concerned about her health

edit: i also want to mention than i know that when i was younger she went to therapy for a while (i’m not sure why, probably just generally) and she quit pretty fast because she hated being told what’s wrong with her (narcissist lol), so i don’t know if therapy would be effective for her because i feel like she would just quit again /:",3

A couple of years ago she went cold-turkey and had a seizure 24hrs later which has resulting in her suffering regular seizures so she's on epilepsy meds.

She managed \*almost\* 4yrs until last august or so and has been bouncing in/out of sobriety since then. She relapsed again last week so is currently on that downward slope that I have no power to stop.

I don't want to give her un-restricted access to alcohol (even though she orders it by taxicab) but I KNOW she needs at least SOME to avoid a shock, but is there such a thing as ""how much"" is enough to keep someone MEDICALLY stable once they're already DEPENDENT on alcohol? Or, is it different for everyone?

As much as it pains me to be an ""enabler"" if I can establish that, for example, half-bottle/day is enough to stop her crashing, then I'm willing to TRY to achieve that, but I fear it's going to be a case of ""it depends"" so no usable answer, but I'm happier that at least I'm asking.

Physically I feel like a massive load of crap, and i don't even know where to start. 

In the past idve left home and drove, either for greasy food or pleasure. Now I'm carless, got $10, and should probably stay home and clean, puke, blood, and the overall mess.

Does it get harder with time? I drank really bad and excessive as a teen. This is my first time drinking in my twenties.

Or if I truly have a problem. I have a gut wrenching feeling that I chose to have a problem with drinking… I’ll explain and share my story.

The first time I ever even had a sip of alcohol (besides on accident when I was 5 when I thought my grandmas wine was apple juice) was when I was 14 in 8th grade. My parents were both on the program so I had very little experience being around alcohol. A year before this my mom did relapse and I learned quickly what being drunk was. Anyways my friend had tried alcoholic and was raving about it so my friend group was like okay so we all stole alcohol from our parents and got together at one friends house. Pretty typical. 
That night I took 8 shots. Right away I noticed how different it made me feel. It seemed like I was finally able to be myself. Looking back it now I have no idea if any of my friends were on the even close to being on the same level as me. The morning after I decided to let my dad know that I drank and to cushion the blow I told him I just had 3 beers. He asked me if I felt the need to drink more and more and I said “yes?” Not knowing that even a red flag. When he told me I backtracked and said “oh well no I wanted to be drunk so it’s okay” but I could tell he was still concerned. Then I started to feel extremely guilty about getting drunk and my friends did not seem to care as much. In fact the next time an opportunity came for us to drink I did not partake because I still felt so shameful from the first time. 

Well then it’s freshman year of highschool and time has passed and I was like “eh it’s normal to drink highschool” so we drank and I remember getting way more drunk this time then last time. I quickly became know as the the “DAB” friend. Always way more drunk then anyone else in the group. And I always did feel guilty about this. People joked and said I was lightweight but what they didn’t know was that I was actually just consuming way more way quicker. It just almost came as instinct. And through the years it seemed like I almost romanticized being the drunk ass bitch. I romatosized the idea of being a sad alcoholic in my late 20s and even back then thought it was pretty much inevitable. 

I always did some awful regrettable thing while drunk and spent a lot of time mulling over my alcohol related regrets. I was SA’d while blacked out junior year of highschool. It was the second time I blacked out for multiple straight hours. The first time I blacked out I stole a giant bottle of gin from the grocery store because I think my friends knew I would do it (because I was the drunkest) and I remember when I succeeded stealing that bottle I thought “I am fucking amazing. I really did this.” And then proceeded to chug half of it, throw up and later wet the bed. Then senior year of highschool comes and I’m actually not getting as drunk as I used too. I’m like hm maybe I have a handle on this dope. But still fantasizing about being an alcoholic. Weirdly. 

Got to college in one of the biggest party towns in California. The culture was binge drinking evrey weekend and it was absolutely encouraged to blackout for three nights in a row. And that’s exactly what I did. But the thing I noticed was that people were using the term “blacked out” when they just wanted an excuse for something that did (that they remember doing) and I truly was not remembering anything I was doing. First semester is fine. Second semester I see a flip in me where I am always always in a bad mood when I drink. I’m stumbling. I’m cussing my best friend out. I don’t remember slapping my best friend but I did when she tried to cut me off from alcohol. I get SA’d again while fully blacked out. But I continue to drink. 
Quarantine hits and I move home with my parents. I don’t drink till summer when I start to see my highschool friends. I slip back into the role of drunkest one at the function always. And drunk me was annoying as fuck. Emotional, stumbling, lying, selfish but also quiet. Move back to college and stuck in our apartment. Just me and three other roommates. With no parties to go to we start to drink while doing nothing in our apartment and evrey time I would get uncomfortably drunk. And evrey morning I would wake up with the worst guilt and anxiety even if didn’t even do anything that awful. 

I was self aware and I accepted the fact that yeah I was fully binge drinking. But agin weirdly was fascinated with the idea of being an alcoholic. Hated drunk me but romanticized her at the same time, thought it was inevitable that I would go through a rough patch then get sober… just like parents always told me they had. Anyways second semester this year. I had a pattern of being in my own apartment drinking with my roommates then blacking out really bad one night and doing something embarrassing so escaping to my parents house for two weeks and that continued until about may. I was drunk texting specific people constantly and waking up wanting to literally kill my self which sound dramatic? But the shame was just intense. 
 My friends 20th birthday rolls around and I remember being overly confident that I would need a shit ton of alcohol to get drunk that day. I remember I wanted to pace myself and be cool around these friends and I was so excited. The day comes and I low and behold blackout embarrass the fuck out of myself break my friends seat and end the night by getting into a fight with my best friend because I couldn’t find any blow. She ended up screaming at me and pushing me over so overall a very toxic friendship but anyways I left our apartment and wandered around the streets alone until I crashed at my other friends house.

 I woke up with so many bruises and scratches, as usual but I had one on my forehead and my roommates told me that I hit my head on concrete. That scared me very bad. I also was scared to see my best friend that I fought with and I was feeling extremely overwhelmed at the fact that I had blacked out for so long. So I called my parents. I told them that I was concerned with my drinking. They obviously suggested that they come down and pick me up from school so I can go home for a few weeks and regroup. 

I get home and the next day is my cousins graduation party. This made me regret telling my parents that I was worried about myself because I knew that there would be alcohol at this party and I would want to drink without them having to worry about me. So we get to the party, my cousin offers me a drink, I pull my mon to the side and pretty much say “never mind I’m fine I’m gonna try to pace myself today and I think I can” well I end up blacking out. In front of my entire family. I don’t think I did anything too bad probably just said some weird shit and stumbled a bit. That night I went to a friends house and did more cringe shit like posting things and drunk texting people. The next day I was like wtfff dude seriously that was pathetic. 

I decide to go to my first AA meeting. And I actually was sober for around 34 days. It was easy because I was at home and not in the environment where I could easily access alcohol. Towards the end though I did start to doubt that I actually had a problem. “Maybe I’m making it up maybe I’m being dramatic, I’m not getting cravings I don’t drink evrey day, I probably could limit myself if I really wanted to i don’t drink other day other people have it way worse” and of course “it’s my fault I literally spoke this into existence. I chose to be an alcoholic” 

I get back to my own apartment and about a week later decide to start drinking again. This summer it seemed that sometimes yea I would brown out/ black out but other times I did truly just have a couple casually. I mean of course I did blackout on 4th of July because it’s a holiday right and I wanted to! And on my 21st birthday of course I was going to blackout (even though I previously stated I didn’t want to be uncomfortably drunk on my birthday) and of course it was normal to spend the week after my birthday sleeping because evrey time I was awake I was regretting what I did on bday night. And it was normal that I wanted to drink after that because of how embarrassed I was right? Even if I didn’t really have any plans they come up so I might as well pregame alone? So then I don’t drink for a few weeks because I’m traveling until about three weeks ago. 

Me and my Roomate get into a car accident. I decide I want to get fucked up because that’s the only way to calm my adrenaline rush. I brown out and do exactly what I told myself not to do (next these two people) hate myself for it and decide to wait to read what I said till I was drunk again. Moved into a new apartment where I had my own bedroom. 

Spent the last two weeks pretty much drinking with friends then coming back to my room and drinking more until I passed out. Obviously I did the same regrettable shit I always do and hated myself for it. 
The last time I drank was when I went to my friends with half a bottle of wine and really only wanted that and maybe another beer that night. But then people started doing shots and I was bored so I started doing them. Then we went to a different persons house and I was drunk but someone offered me a beer so of course I took it and proceeded to find two more somehow, blackout, apparently my friends friend drove me home because I was falling evreywhere, and when I got home I drank more. Then I couldn’t sleep so at 6 am I decided to walk to the ocean and I thought to sober me up I would swim in it. 

The rest of the day I was shaking. I was so exhausted and couldn’t sleep. My heart felt like it was gonna explode which I don’t know if it was just all the caffeine I consumed or actually withdrawals. So I decided to go to a meeting. 

And now we’re here. And I don’t know what to think. This was extremely long so kuddos to you if you read it this far. I still have the same doubts. I still wonder if I’m just being dramatic. I still wonder if me romanticizing alcoholism has anything to do with it? Who the fuck romanticizes addiction while actively may have one? I feel like it’s all my fault. I feel like if anyone in my real life or groups knew that I daydream about being an addict that they would think I’m literally psycho. This shit is not fun. Spending most of my time thinking of all my regrets is not fucking fun. Being looked at as the girl who is always wayy too drunk is not fun and how hard it is to control my drinking is not fun so then wtf am I thinking when I idealize this shit? Why do I want this? Is it a fucking coping mechanism? 

I have taken quizzes and evrey single one has said I have a “severe alcohol use disorder” and when I tell my story and thoughts to people most of the time they are like “….yeah”. I was shocked to learn that most of my friends have not actually blacked out from alcohol. Anyways. What’s new I think I’m a bad person and I’m so confused and lost and ugh just needed to vent. Pretty much all regrets I have are related to what I’ve done drunk. Alcohol has never added anything positive to my life.",3

I (23) have a family history of alcoholism. My paternal grandfather was a scotsman and died drinking the drink religiously at a young age of 62. My father himself is a self proclaimed functioning alchy, and we have gotten obliterated on many many occasions.

My maternal grandmother was born from russian immigrants and drank a liter of vodka a day and my mother hated it. She would go to work drunk just to come home and get even more fucked up. She was hit and killed by a drunk driver when my mom was 16. My mother's first husband was an abusive alcoholic and died drunk driving.

Now of course everything is personally subjective so I cannot solely blame genetics, but it is highly disturbing to me to have these things told to me all my life and still succumb to the thirst.

I took the first sip at 12, and I was in love. I drank occasionally from then, sneaking what I could, and being given beer by bad influences. It never really was my main escape, I preferred weed. When I turned 21, that did a 180. I abused my legal age and proceeded to get drunk every day for two months straight after. If it wasnt for my mom, I would not have slowed down the 12 pack a night here, half a liter of vodka a night there.

When I got my own place early in the year I still only drank 2 or 3 times a week and that was the lowest since I turned 21. My father came and visited and seeing his lifestyle of crushing tallboys and 12 or 15 packs day after day, night after night, like it was the norm was, in a very disturbing way, admirable. I followed in his wake and since he left I find myself drinking the same way. I have been sober the past 4 months enough times to count on one hand. I am getting sick of it, but I always find myself sneaking to the gas station again. It's like I know I'm looking at an alligator in the water but I still choose to jump on it. I don't even have much fun anymore drunk but it's still vastly more interesting than being sober. I really wish I wasn't like this.

I am sure other people with longer periods of obliteration will be going through much worse, mentally and physically, but this is what I'm staring in the face. I just hope to God I can snap out of it before then.",3

Hopefully give myself some peace of mind and potentially help someone else.

I have been a frequent drinker since 20 and am now 27. Recently I have been drinking every day since about January. Anywhere from 6-16 drinks a night. I have had a few nights off but only about twice a month in this time. In my previous years I could go most week days off so I would get hungover on the weekend when I’d drink. So totally normal. Recently tho I have been noticing I don’t get hungover really at all. So yesterday I made a decision to cut back and my goal is to goal at least a week sober (hopefully longer if I know what’s good for me)

I have been 36 hours sober and my symptoms just started a few hours ago. I have a temperature of 99.5, aches, no appetite, and I get nauseous when I try to eat. I know everyone is different but frankly I am a bit surprised I’m having noticeable symptoms at all. I guess my question is does this make sense to others and has anyone with similar drinking patterns had extended issues like these. I am really hoping I’ll be past this by the weekend so I can chill out and relax without worrying about it. Thanks for any advice you can give.

Ps I am vaccinated, and don’t have any sore throat loss of senses or cough so I dont think it is Covid, but who knows.",4

2021-08-18 15:44:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/p6ymzh/trying_to_quit_safely_hoping_for_advice_long_story/,"Trying to quit safely, hoping for advice (long story)","Help me out here, Reddit.

Started drinking heavily around February 2018. Almost every single night, roughly the equivalent to 1 bottle of Mad Dog 40/40 per night. So, for math purposes, 750ml of 14% each night. A couple of times that year I went a week or so without drinking, but always fell back into it. It began as an emotional crutch but became a habit and continued on after things got better. Since probably 4-5 months in, there hasn't been a ""reason"" to drink except out of habit.

That gradually increased over time, as you'd expect, and at this point I'm drinking prettymuch every night. Skipped nights are few and far between. I don't enjoy it anymore, so it's an exact science at this point. Exactly 375ml of 80 proof gin, consumed between 9pm and 11pm. Ideally sleep by 1am, though that time varies. This is my method for making it to work every morning at 8am without being too hungover. Somehow I've managed to hide this problem from my family/friends for 3.5 years.

So, as you can imagine, drinking this much kind of messed up my life. Lazy and lethargic during the day, emotionally unavailable, low motivation, planning my evenings around drinking, etc. So a little over a week ago my wife told me she wants a divorce. The next day I revealed my drinking problem. It's a long and complicated story but she was very accepting of the problem and willing to work with me to fix it. There's also a non-zero chance that she'll reconsider leaving me if I can fix my shit and actually start being a decent husband again.

So there's my motivation to quit, aside from not wanting to feel like garbage all of the time anymore. I've spent days reading up on this, but after finally telling my doctor about it yesterday, his assessment is that I could be critically in danger of developing DT and dying from this if I tried to quit cold-turkey. He told me that I was at risk of seizure/heart attack anywhere from 8-45 days after my last drink.

Here's the kicker: Before he told me that, I hadn't touched the stuff since Wednesday night of last week. So, six days sober. Aside from hardcore insomnia, I was actually feeling better than I have in a long time. Stomach stopped hurting, headaches other than from the sleep loss were gone. No other symptoms to speak of except that I felt a bit dizzy toward the middle of the day which I attributed to the sleep loss.

Doctor recommended I go to the ranch. Full-blown 30 day program. Until I can get checked in, he told me to start drinking again, reduce my intake to 75% of what it was previously, and if that's not enough to sleep, supplement it with up to 50mg of Benadryl. Sleep meds and alcohol kind of freaks me out, but if the doctor says it's safe in small quantities I can make it work I guess. But I don't have time to get spirited away to play cornhole and talk about my feelings for a month. My job is critically all-hands-on-deck right now, I'm very likely selling my house and leasing an apartment and moving soon, and many more reasons.

So last night, suddenly aware of my own mortality, I drank the 75% as instructed. Carefully measured, separated into different containers so that I couldn't have that drunken ""one more swig is probably fine"" moment. It absolutely wrecked my shit. I wouldn't have expected such a profound reduction in tolerance in six days, but that was too much alcohol. I plan to reduce it more tonight to hit an acceptable level, and my friends who I shared all of this info with agreed that a 25% reduction was conservative at best. I also took 25mg of the Benadryl before bed, but I really don't think I needed it.

At the risk of sounding like I think I know better than a medical professional (you can call me Karen, I deserve it), I don't think I'm as at-risk for DT as my doctor does. I take vitamin D supplements, my chaser is red Powerade, I drink plenty of water. I got the early shakes when I stopped last week, but that was almost totally gone by yesterday. And from the dozens of sources I've looked at online, I've never seen ANYTHING that goes as far out as 45 days. That seems like an unreasonably long time, potentially a CYA in the event of some freak occurrence. The majority of info I've found suggests that if you're still alive after 8-10 days you're in the clear.

The plan: I want to extrapolate the doctor-prescribed ""survival drinking"" into a tapering method. I bought two bottles yesterday that divided conveniently into six equal portions to almost perfectly match my 75% number. Considering how wasted that one portion got me, tonight I think I'm going to even those remaining 5 into 6 again. I haven't done the math yet, but it's... Actually I'll just do that. 235ml per night. 

So 235ml per night, six days, then probably reduce further for the next six days, and so on. The insomnia will wear off eventually, I'm not worried about that. Just as long as I'm not going to have a seizure while driving or something, or just keel over in the middle of the day.

Motivation-wise, if it was strictly psychological, I could walk through the fire and flames to make this work. If I wasn't risking my life, I could handle any misery that withdrawal could throw at me. I don't enjoy drinking anymore, and I don't ever ""crave"" the stuff. I'm just sick of it and want to be done with it. I'm not concerned about relapsing or anything, because laziness supersedes any other factor and if I don't have to go out of my way to put on pants and go to the store and buy alcohol, that's just a bonus. And with even the slightest sliver of a chance of saving my marriage, there's really no question.

I guess I haven't really specified what I'm asking for here. Advice, I guess? Anyone who has quit drinking before with a similar record, or gone through anything remotely like this, or someone who has survived DT. I'm just looking for any advice I can get. I'm thoroughly confident that I can kick this without a trip to the ranch, I'm just worried about it from a safety standpoint. If the doctor hadn't scared the shit out of me yesterday, I'd be on my seventh day sober.

tl;dr - You kind of have to read it to get the full picture but I need advice on quitting without being one of the 1-20 who die from the DT that 3-5% of alcoholics develop.

Edit: forgot to include that I have a full blood test to do after work today so the results of that will help me manage whatever myriad of nutrient deficiencies I have.",1

After that I was clean for seven months until July 4th, (just seeing everyone else drinking and “having fun” started me again) I drank on and off in July but kept track of my drinks because I didn’t want to fall back into it, but I did and by august 9th I was back up to 12-14 drinks per night. 

I’m currently following that guide but also feeling really nervous. 

I don’t have any tremors or other withdrawal symptoms so Is it just my anxiety because I read online that withdrawal can be deadly, or is just being super anxious enough to go back to the er (whom I’ve called and they said they don’t do detox anymore. After previously admitting me twice on different floors (they don’t have a general detox floor.) They’ll help me when I come in and then transfer me ti one of the terrible places I said in the beginning. 

So is it withdrawals or just anxiety? I’m open to all opinions.",1

Last Saturday was an all time low for me. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide while visiting my girlfriend. 

I started drink in 8th grade. At the time it would be some Smirnoff ices every 2 months. While I began taking shot in Highschool, the frequency of drinking never really increased. I tried to limit my alcohol consumption because alcoholism runs in my family, three family members currently fall victim to it. 

I went to college and began drinking more often. My freshman year wasn’t bad, although there would be spurts of blacking out and getting wasted. After joining a fraternity my second semester I noticed I drank significantly more, but so did everyone else hung out with. 

My sophomore year I met my girlfriend. She is above my league and I would be nervous around her, this would result in me drinking before I hung out with her - luckily we would go to parties together so it wouldn’t be suspicious or weird. As we started dating, I became comfortable around her. 

My junior year was pretty much my first incident. It was HER 21st birthday and I blacked out at her pregame, even though I couldn’t go to the bars. Normally blacking out wasn’t that much of an issue, but I was a mess there. Her friends were no happy and she was concerned. A few months later I turned 21 and had a pregame. I tried to not black out in fear of repairing the same events, but my fraternity brother literally shoved alcohol down my mouth. That night we had probably our first big fight. I was saying nonsense, called my ex to prove a point, and puked all over her bathroom. 

Senior year she moved back to DC, she was a year older. To not feel lonely, I decided to live in the fraternity house. Things then began to worsen again. It was fun and games drinking but I had more incidents. Shortly before my birthday I blacked out at th bars and cheated on my gf and got a lap dance from a Stripper. I even got her snapchap to have sex with her that night, luckily I fell asleep after ubering home. More arguments with my gf ensued, she even told me that she began having feeling for another guy.

I decided to go to grad school since COVID took away a lot of jobs. That is when I really noticed that this relationship with alcohol began deteriorating. I would be a dumbass and start fights when drinking with my friends. I also would try to start fights at random people at the bars, on the streets, and even a nurse once who shared an Uber with me. I even cheated on my gf again but getting another lap dance, this time on my birthday but at the same strip club.

I noticed that I would become an aggressive drunk now. This leads us to last week. I went to dc to visit my gf for 10 days. I arrived Friday and we made plans to go out with her family/friends to get bottomless mimosas. At this time I haven’t had alcohol in a while - this is mostly because I started antidepressants and was scared to drink on it. The days before going to DC I increased my prescription. The day we drank was my second day on this increase [300 xl bupropion]. I noticed that I got tipsy quickly, but wanted to pace myself. I began posting non-pc content on social media while drinking - I noticed I did this to spark arguments with people. 

We went home and I was ready to stop… I wanted to stop. When I start drinking I find it very hard to stop. I was also iced my my gf’s brother 4 different times, one of them being a big bottle. 

I was being a disrespectful dumbass infront if my gf, her brother, and young uncle. I began telling her secrets and we had an argument. I stormed off and began walking to her place. I grabbed my suitcase, told her parents that I think it is over between us, and began walking to the airport (2:30 hours away). On the way to the airport I went to the liquor store and bought a fifth of whiskey. 

I began crying and walking. I called my gf that it is over. I layed down on a patch of grass and told some more of my antidepressants. She called again and I told her what I did. I called my family and told them that I love them and said goodbye. My girlfriend told my mom the situation - my mom attempted suicide when I was young. 

My girlfriend found me walking the streets with my suitcase in one hand and a bottle in the other. She grabbed the bottle and threw it on the ground. The cops arrived later and took me to the hospital for attempted suicide.

I went to the worst hospital in DC, verified by the internet. They took my belongings, phone, rosary, and shoes. They put me in a chair and locked me in a room with other mentally unstable people. I was there for 18 hours. They ran out of water. Took 40 minutes to bring me ibuprofen after puking. They wouldn’t let me call my gf - I had to tel them I was calling my sister.

Now I am home. I don’t feel good. I wanted to have a good time drinking with my gf and her family. I am still dating my gf, but she isn’t too hopeful about things right now and I don’t blame her. 

Even now, I still crave a nice six pack of coors. Even after all of this, I would struggle turning down a drink.

I'm 18 years old and I'm a heavy drinker. I woke up 8am and haven't touched the bottle since, which I can suppose means progress to some extent, It's being really tough since the first thing I used to do was to take a shot even before brushing my teeth. Everything began with my ex-girlfriend. She used to come over with some drinks and we'd spend the whole weekend having fun, playing cards, videogames, etc. I first noticed something was wrong when I started drinking out of social events/without my ex, but it wasn't every day and wasn't in big quantities. When she broke up with me, I started drinking every single day, and got back to smoking. At the time I was fit, happy, had a nice job, didn't have depression, but as you might imagine, it all came downhill. I've lost my muscles, my motivation, and worst of all, my job. I started letting myself go, eating less and drinking more, to the point I drank a whole bottle of 40% rum in just one day. You might be thinking I'm too young to be that addicted to alcohol, but it really is becoming something serious for me. I have a lot of withdrawal symptoms and given the prolonged time and amount I've been drinking, I don't think cold-turkeying it is a good idea. At the moment I use to drink half a bottle a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. I'm here to ask for advice, what is are some good ways of completely stopping my drinking? I've considered reducing the consumption gradually, but how gradually? A shot less each week? Maybe a shot less in two weeks? And for those who have been cured of this nasty curse, can you still drink ocasionally? I think that when I get sober I wouldn't be able to drink even wine. Thank you all.",2

I was always afraid of how his alcoholism would affect our future and was admittedly always preparing for the worst perhaps not allowing myself to give him my best in order to protect myself.

He had been more or less sober in the six months we lived together, but with sobriety came something unexpected- depression. He didn’t know how to have fun without alcohol. And we started having less meaningful conversations as he just withdrew inward more and more.

I felt like he was growing distant and especially felt like my needs for physical intimacy weren’t being met- not just sexually- I wanted him to touch me more. I expressed this and he just shut down. I ended up dumping him over it.

Now that we’ve broken up he seems like he’s relieved. He is drinking again. I feel hurt and I’m wondering if he ever misses me or is even upset. I would be willing to give thing another try and work on our issues, but he is not.

He had only gotten sober when we started living together, and honestly I always felt like he resented me for it, bc I was never as much fun or made him as happy as booze did.

If you’re an alcoholic can you provide some perspective on this? I honestly feel like our relationship was stronger when he was drinking than when he wasn’t.",9

I’ve been working this whole time and trying to take care of everything around the house and in our lives. He keeps telling me he needs more time.

Over the past couple of years, she has been through a lot. She has lost both her parents and my dad recently lost his dad and lost his mom ten years or so before that.

She has MS and was diagnosed when I was six months old. She has detailed her rough upbringing to me as well.

I noticed that after my dad lost his father, my mom began drinking more than once a week. This increased to most days out of the week, to every single day.

She can be relatively cheerful and normal when drunk /sometimes/ but for the most part she screams and cries, sometimes for hours if nobody tries to cuddle her out of it or feed her.

I’m at a loss of what to do here. I never provide her with alcohol, despite being a manager at a Liquor Store. She does try to guilt me about this on occasion. 

My dad regularly buys her alcohol just because he doesn’t want her to bitch at him. I wish he wouldn’t, that way she would at least begin to realize she has a problem. Maybe?

Not giving any medical advice, just telling what I personally did.  
I am a health nut in a way. 48yo, weigh about 155lbs. Been drinking off and on since I was 18yo. I tend to drink for a few years, then stop for a few years. I don't drink because I'm bored, I drink because I have nerve damage, am in pain alot, and have been through some horrendous crap in my life. Even now. I eat as natural and organic as I can, and avoid almost all sugars. (I do like dark chocolate sometimes though) Even after drinking this much for so long, my liver seemed to be alright. I have had blood tests done every 6 months or so. Most recent one was about 30 days ago. Only issue I have ever had that came up on the blood tests was that my potassium level was .1 over what it should be. I take multi-minerals, multivitamins, Ester C vit C, Vit D, B-complex, Glycine, (protects the liver) and methylcobalamin (good form of B-12) about 6 times a week. I take a break every Sunday so nothing builds up too much. 

What I did to get me through it:  
Made sure I started on a Friday and had the weekend off. Got a box of nitrous (whip-its) to get me through the worst of it. Took it easy and played some video games most of the day. I never started drinking before about 3pm, so around 3pm, crawled into bed and put Netflix on. Ate as much good healthy food as I could, because I want to drink less with a full stomach. Thankfully I have a prescription for Lyrica, which really helps me with the withdrawals. Also took about 1.5grams of Phenibut each day of withdrawal which works on similar GABA receptors as alcohol. I've used cannabis before to help, but didn't this time.

Day 1: Sucked, but got through it ok. Drank a ton of seltzer water to help stay hydrated and flush things out. Nitrous really kept my mind off it. Phenibut, Lyrica, and Glycine helped me sleep ok.  
Day 2: Woke up at 7am to a burst pipe under my house. Yeay.. Got the pipe fixed, but rest of the day SUCKED from having to deal with that AND withdrawal. Got through it ok though. More nitrous, phenibut, lyrica, and glycine. Didn't sleep as well. Crawling under the house didn't sit well on my nerve damaged back. 

Day 3: (today) Very tired from not sleeping well and withdrawals. Sweating alot. No more nitrous, but things aren't too bad today. 

Day 4 should be a little easier from experience. Usually takes about 3 weeks before I don't crave it anymore, but for me at least, each day gets a little easier. 

Just posting this incase anyone needs some encouragement to stop. It can be done without too many withdrawal symptoms. (At least for me) Do what works for you. Be sure to work with your doc incase you have other health probs. 

P.S. I have not tried it, but I have read that the plant supplement Kudzu makes you feel not great if you take it and drink alcohol, so might be a good deterrent for someone who needs extra help.",3

Why does alcohol perk me up? Not wake me up early or keep me from sleeping (though it can do those too). But, right now I'm wiped out from a lack of sleep and a long weekend. I need to get a few things accomplished and I'm literally wanting to have a few drinks to get some energy back in my system and get going again. It feels the way for me that caffeine seems to work for most people. 

I snap immediately to attention at the bottom of my first glass and unless I get truly trashed I find it quite invigorating. My wife on the other hand is a 2-3 drinks and sleepy person.

Does anyone with a science background (not looking for guesses here, I work in the sciences and am perfectly capable of coming up with my own goofy theories without involving reddit) know the actual physiological answer for this? And does anyone know why, at least anecdotally, it seems to be more common in alcoholics than the general population. 

It seems silly, but I feel like some awareness of this might help me handle my drinking more safely.

tl;dr: We have a new tenant (less than 3 months) who lives in our home and rents a room whom I suspect drives under the influence 2-3 times a month, but I can't prove anything, have only my (and my spouse's) assumptions, and do not know what to do.

My dad was an alcoholic and cocaine abuser for roughly 6 years during my early teen years and has been sober going on 16 years. I spoke with him regarding this situation and he advised me not to do anything and wait while we came up with a plan (if one is even necessary) while he talked to an police friend of his who was also in the program.

We have a newish tenant in our home, lets call her Glenda. She is a well educated single woman, excellent credit and financials, teaches at a local university part-time, and holds a phd in a complex science and is quiet, polite, and pays rent on time. She is on a month to month lease. She was referred to us from an extended friend, and gave me no pause for any reason when we met with her multiple times as well as was very easy to communicate with. Glenda is an introvert much like myself. She stores a lot of hard alcohol in her room for some reason rather than in the pantry (with our hard alcohol/wine/beer etc). We know because she goes shopping and puts her groceries in the pantry and fridge, but always takes her handles with her. 

Early on in our relationship on the 4th of July weekend (she had only been living with us about a week and a half), she got absolutely plastered in her room by herself. The only reason we know was because she stumbled out to kick it with us but was obviously slurring/swaying and just wasted. This was early on when she was still very closed off from us and we did not really know each other yet. We thought it was weird but chalked it up to the 4th celebrations. 

About a week after the above, she came from somewhere (she drives her own vehicle and parks near the house we have external security cameras to verify), and this is where it gets tricky because I could have sworn she was fucked up and she had just driven herself not 3 minutes ago. If you know what to look for you know what I mean. At this point I got nothing but assumptions so even though it made me uneasy I left it alone. She nearly confirmed it was a one time thing because for 2 weeks after we only saw her drinking water and eating extremely healthily (fruits veggies etc) and she made a few comments acknowledging her level of drunkenness which we of course ignored. 

Then in the later half of July, on her birthday she left the house clear cool and collected. She returned between 9-10pm and she was in my opinion fucked up again. Slurring when I greeted her and she responded, way too loud, almost tone deaf to her surroundings but this time quickly went into her room. She came out five minutes later absolutely blasted like on the 4th (she could not have gotten to the level I saw her at in 5 minutes, no way). Checked the cameras and yep she had just driven home 5 minutes prior. 

Then it happened again last night. This time my spouse and I were on the couch again and its late. Glenda came in hot through the garage, and our dog started barking because he heard her and she entered into the living room while barking loudly almost jokingly (but with a slurryness to it) I guess to match the dog which was itself kinda weird (she loves dogs and our dog loves her). She immediately squatted onto the floor of the living room and began a way too intense and loud kissy/cuddle session with our dog while nearly falling after doing the drunk sway. I flicked on the lights and her eyes were glazing over, her face was that light red flush color, and she was clearly not all there. 

I am trying here to give her the benefit of the doubt, but last night my spouse pulled me aside after we went to our room and said to me ""She was wasted right, it wasn't just me noticing it?"" and I nodded in agreement. 

So far I have considered confronting her (which based on my dads history I know never goes well, they need to hit rock bottom and want to change). Keep in mind we are also really just friendly acquaintances at this point but to prevent her from driving while drunk I would literally physically restrain her (but she is never drunk before she leaves nor have I seen her get into a car in my presence or on our security cameras, and just comes back plastered imo). I would not want to accuse her, or confront her based on some judgements and my own read on her symptoms, or create a legal battle while she lives here (or even want to try to evict her in this housing market), I do not want her to damage us or my home and obviously the thought of her going out and plowing into another person or vehicle and murdering someone has my stomach in knots but I am not her dad or an authority. Do I talk to her and potentially permanently damage our relationship? I am seriously at a loss and would appreciate any advice.  Her car appears to have damage from backing into things, and many drunk dings. 

What do I do? 

Thank you very much.

I am a young woman (24) and I have had a problem with alcohol / escapism since I was about 17. I am definitely a problem drinker and there were times in my life (specifically when i was 21/22) that I felt genuinely powerless over alcohol. Then i had a wakeup call, got into a car accident when I was driving on a bender and I moved country and totally stopped drinking. I didn't drink for a year and it wasn't even difficult this is what I don't understand, suddenly it was just easy). 

Anyway, for the past few weeks I've gone back drinking heavily. Drinking alone at the weekend, waking up the morning drinking again. I've lost the past few days of my life and I can feel my responsibilities starting to slip - I have been here before. I went out the other night and realized that I was there to get drunk and didn't actually care to talk to anyone. 

I am so scared that i'll end up in another accident or that something bad will happen. I really thought I had 'cured' my problems with alcohol - I want to go back to when I didn't think about it :( 

Any advice appreciated. I don't really want to go to AA, I don't know why i've suddenly gone back to my old self. Has anyone bee in this situation before?",14

2021-08-15 20:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/p54wnv/ive_been_drinking_myself_sober_for_the_past_6/,I've been drinking myself sober for the past 6 months. I went from at least 30 drinks a week to under 4 a week. The Sinclair Method works if you follow the instructions.,"I know, drinking yourself sober is crazy counter-intuitive, right? It's exactly the method that has a 80+% success rate, which trumps AA's 8-18% success rate(some estimates have it lower at only one or five percent). Not to bash AA, because I tried AA for three years before I even *heard of* this other method.

The method is where you take 50mg of naltrexone exactly one hour before you drink. This is the golden rule that must never be broken, or it wont work. The naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors in your brain, which is one of the ""feel good"" chemicals, and it's one of the main systems alcohol works on. It works basically like Pavlov's dogs but in reverse, which also makes sense because if you ring the bell and don't feed the dogs, they would unlearn that habit, right? Yes, this was actually the other thing Pavlov proved with his bell-food-dog experiments. 

There is a second, and probably much worse outcome if you don't follow the golden rule and decide to drink in the 2 days after taking the pill. It leads to hyper-sensitivity of the opioid system, so things like exercise, dark chocolate, spicy food, sex and drinking, will feel so much better than they normally do. This sort of non-compliance is one of the major ways of the method not working. If med compliance is factored into the stats, it has over a 90% success rate.

When I drink now, I feel relaxed, a little bit giddy followed by being tired and wanting a nap.

The FDA royally fucked up when they set up the prescribing standards though. They said to take one daily, usually in the morning. This doesn't work because the naltrexone only has maximum efficacy in 4-6 hours after peak blood levels(yes, if you plan on drinking for longer it's wise to take another pill and wait an hour at some point). And every study done with this method of taking the pill shows little benefit vs placebo. 

As I said in the title, I was told by my psychiatrist to track my drinks because it's not always a steady downward trend. There are spikes in drinking, which are followed by lower rates of drinking after them. I know I was drinking more than 40-50 units a week before I started the sinclair method, but I only have actual data from the day I started it. And that first week was 35 drinks a week.

The first 3 months, I generally drank at the 25-30 drink mark, with some weeks alternating, under 14(as I naturally got alcohol free days) to the ""norm"" the next week. But after that, I was getting more weeks under 20 units a week and longer stretches of lower drinking. Until two weeks ago, when I had a major spike, what is known as an ""extinction burst"". And if you're a parent or work with kids, you know what they are because they are the most massive tantrums that a child will pull to try and get their way, but if you don't give in, then they generally listen after that. And that's what happened, my extinction burst lasted about 8 days(with only a couple days total being over 5 drinks in a session). But now I have almost no desire to drink at all. 

Before my extinction burst I was drinking under 14 units a week for 5 weeks. That's under two beers a day.

The only reason I am still drinking 4 units on the weekend, is because I do still have urges to continue drinking so I'm preplanning them out ahead of time, with a set amount to drink. It's the 5-2-2 method where you do 5 days AF and then 2 days of 2 units a day. This is to prevent the alcohol deprivation effect from kicking in and leading to a binge. The alcohol deprivation effect is very well known, just not that it has a name. In AA the saying is ""while you're in here, your alcoholism is doing push ups in the parking lot"", which means that if you do have that first drink, it's going to be impossible to stop and will be just as bad as peak use or worse. 

I used to never be able to just stop drinking. It was always ""more more more"" after that first drink. But now, after 6 months of taking my pill before I drink, I found it effortless to stop drinking this afternoon when I had my two beers while watching a show. 

This shit, that I thought was either going to kill me or leave me brain dead from drinking too much, actually worked and has reduced my drinking by so much. I've even changed my mind and realized that I don't have to go 100% abstinent because as long as I take the pill before drinking, it will just be another session into the ""don't drink"" pile. I could take it before a new years party and have a great time and *not get drunk*, just a bit tipsy and tired. 

My whole life has changed since I started the sinclair method. Before, I would just drink myself stupid every night and feel hungover till midday when I could then be productive for a few hours before it was time to drink myself stupid again. I feel so much more clear headed now, and I'm starting to feel like my life can get back on track, at least a little bit. I no longer feel trapped, having a *need* to drink, and now I just *get to* drink when I want. The days are no longer a roll of the dice on how much I'll end up drinking that day, I can get what I want to drink, and I don't need to consume it all in one go. 

I'm hopefully nearing the end of drinking myself sober. I'm prepared in case there is another extinction burst, but I'm doubting that will happen. My desire has gone down so much.",47

It gets worse and worse the longer it goes and he is stuck badly.  
Every time we meet, or talk online or what ever we do he ends up really drunk to the point it is hard to understand what he says, often stuff we do get interrupted and sends me home or goes to sleep because he is too drunk.   
He does it almost every day even when he is alone.

For quite some times he tells me that he wants to quit and he knows that this is really bad for him, but doing it without professional help does not work and he knows it. He doesn't want help as well, because ""The battle is lost"" and ""They can not tell me something new"".

Today he told me something that make me sick of worries. We talked and he told how done he is with his life and the only thing that keeps him alive is that he is too proud to kill himself and he does want to create a family. He is also afraid that his bad mental state gets even worse if he stops drinking.  
What makes it worse that a really close friend we both really like had a suicide attempt because of psychosis that came from getting rid of doing drugs.  
I talked with him a million times about his alcoholism and i get the feeling that it gets worse every time we talk about it and there is almost never progress....sometime there is, but only temporary.   


You guys probably see such posts regularly, but i don't know what to do anymore.   
I'm usually good with such situations but I'm at wits end. It is really exhausting for me every time he is that drunk and i don't know what to say or do anymore.",10

Genuine,"Im a young adult woman and i have used alcohol as a coping mechanism for depression for years. I’d say i would either get rlly drunk at parties or buy strong alcohol when i could afford it every few months or so? I have always thought that surely im not because i dont crave it and i dont do it often at all, but i know i dont have a healthy relationship with it because most the time i use it to numb my depression. Anyway i was just searching about how to stop drinking and limit yourself when getting drunk because once i start i dont know when to stop and maybe id say i cant stop? I wouldn’t know if i couldnt because i always WANT to drink more. I recently got way too drunk to the point i hit two of my friends and i dont remember a thing. I am not a violent person in the slightest and had a hard time believing this. The past few times ive drank i blacked out. Ive been told by my friends to just stop and limit myself (coming from people that arent drunk when they decide to stop) but i thought the main well known thing about drinking is that it inhibits your decision making and makes you want to drink more (this is science that it encourages you to drink more). But now im hearing on this sub that if you dont stop it is alcoholism.

Edit: However how does it necessarily make you an alcoholic to not stop because i, in comparison to my friends LIKE being drunk and want to further how drunk i am at parties, whereas they prefer to be sober and don’t like being more than slightly buzzed. So of course they will decide to stop sooner than me. I just reach the point i cant make proper decisions bc i like to get drunk but once im there obviously my decision making is inhibited. (Like everyone elses is)

Edit again: ive always been the one to get the most drunk at parties and started at around 15 which is normal in the UK. I think out of my peers I definitely prefer to not be sober probably for the fact they don’t suffer with mental illness.",2

I had talked to my Dr who prescribed me Ativan to quit drinking. Unfortunately, I then got a DUI, mostly because I had mixed the two. It wasn't until a few months later that I finally really took charge of my issues. I thought covid shutdowns would make it worse, but it actually helped me. 

Fast forward a year, and I'm starting to struggle, kind of teetering that ledge. Going days of binge drinking, waking up and drinking, barely making it through work without a drink. But I would tell myself I had to quit for a few days. I'd feel like shit the first day or so, but after that I'd be okay. And I'd do it. Go a few days without drinking, feeling the sweats and rapid heart rate that first day or so. But I'd push through. 

Now I'm reaching the point that I'm not able to do that. I'm back to drinking every day. 

My whole point of this post is that I have a Dr appt tomorrow morning. Mostly because my primary moved so I'm getting established with a new one. But I'm thinking of talking to her about medication to help me. I don't want the benzos again. Last time in order to come off the benzos I actually had to taper them with hard cider. I'm looking into something to curb my urge to drink, make me sick when I drink, something. 

Can someone help me with any insight on medications that have helped you or someone you know? I've been down this road before. And I'm terrified. Tomorrow morning is my one shot to talk to my new doctor. I have iinsurance, so medical coverage isn't a concern.",3

I figured this could be a good community to reach out to for some advice and recommendations regarding an issue I’ve been dealing with for years and now it’s coming to a head. 

I’ll try to keep this brief:

My mother (65 if that’s useful) has been an alcoholic for probably about a decade if not more. Let’s just say I’ve done pretty much everything I can without totally becoming estranged to let her know I find her alcohol abuse to be detrimental not only to herself but also our family, particularly my relationship with her. So at this point it’s an issue she’s very familiar with but has failed to make concrete efforts for tangible improvement. To a certain degree I have resigned myself, especially after officially passing the baton to her therapist after a group session where I expressed my concerns and said I am not in a position to keep dealing with it and draining my own emotional energy. 

This past Father’s Day my boyfriend (of 7 years, so it’s pretty serious) and his mom came to my parents house for brunch. It was a big deal since my boyfriends family hasn’t spent much time with my parents and it’s super important to me that all of their interactions go smoothly. Unfortunately, it went the opposite and my mom made my boyfriends mom (who is an absolute sweetheart) EXTREMELY uncomfortable since she immediately got plastered and started crying about all of her problems and literally forced my boyfriends mom into a corner and had her console her WHILE we’re all trying to have a pleasant meal celebrating my father. My mom later tripped in the bathroom and hit her head (she’s fine) and that concluded the evening. Apparently my boyfriends family is really concerned and is very weary with any future get togethers (understandably).  This makes me feel humiliated and really angry. 

It looks like our two families are about to go on a week long vacation and will be sharing a beach house. My mom will definitely be in the mood to drink but it’s going to be painfully obvious since my boyfriends family is Southern, religious, and not the type to be confrontational if they get uncomfortable which sucks because my mom is NOT good at reading the room especially when she’s drinking. What am I supposed to do?? I’m freaking out and really distraught already… I’d greatly appreciate any advice from all viewpoints. Thank you <3",1

I don't quite remember how I wound up in this mess but I've started taking a heavy amount of gabapentin and solpadol just to numb the pain in my throat and head. I usually wake up around 3 in the day, and cry tears of pain while I try to swallow half a box of solpadol with a few glasses of captain Morgan to get rid of this fucking affliction that nature has decided to gift me with. I took two weeks off of work so now im just eating away at money that I'm definitely gonna need next week, but I don't see myself ever putting down the bottle or the tablets because I am in constant pain all of the time. I ring my ex when I get too drunk and curse down the phone at her. I adored her. Probably gonna get my teeth kicked in by her older brother now.

Now she's been diagnosed with fatty liver disease and has been told she has to quit drinking. She has always been in a semi-denial, but this is the first time she's been hit with it more seriously, and finally she is taking steps to sobriety. I feel so proud of her, im tearing up just writing this first paragraph...

I've heard quitting alcohol suddenly can be pretty dangerous, so im looking for some advice for her. She wasn't a super heavy drinking (like not strong drinks) but would drink at least 5 glasses of wine daily, and some beer too. Drinking first thing in the morning, etc. So maybe she's not even at risk of these sudden quitting consequences.

With her consumption, would she be better off tampering off it little by little, or is it okay for her to go full on and just quit? She doesn't even want to drink, but im not sure if she would be safer to have a little beer a day during her first week. Yesterday she had some shaking and a sore head and I was really worried. What are your opinions? Quit cold turkey, or do it slowly?

Also, do you know any good apps she could download to help her quit? Maybe one that helps her track her progress, and see health benefits etc.

Thanks a lot. I know you can't offer medical advice and I won't take it as such, just looking for opinions etc. Thanks",2

Is this normal? Adjusting to life without alcohol and all the dopamine that I was use to? I know this will sound like paranoia, but could it be some type of permanent brain damage? My memory is terrible suddenly, but im admittedly more stressed and depressed then ever, which can greatly effect memory. 

I'm new to this lifestyle, as well as being open and asking for help. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance, knowing that it's normal (ish) and that things will get better. The long road is easier to drive if you know you're going in the right direction.

First of all, I used to drink primarily at night and for the past month after the shakes and all wore off, that was when I was grumpy and craving and depressed the most. But last night, my brain almost immediately flipped on like a light. It was as if I was using only half of it for years. I wondered how many others noticed some gradual improvements in mood and mental functioning but then had a huge leap forward all of the sudden (and if that lasts or swings back and forth?)

Secondly, after that switch lit up, I was shocked by how little the things my mind used to obsess over that caused me to drink bothered me. Right now I'm questioning how much these things actually were that burdensome and painful to me the past 10 years. Because it feels almost like it was a way for my brain to compel me to drink. By amplifying the negative emotions and loneliness (my main triggers. I became addicted as a teen when I started going to bars underage cause nobody would invite me to parties, etc and it became a daily habit then a need)

&#x200B;

And third, given the ages when I started and when I stopped, how likely is it that the damage to my body will be repaired with continued abstinence?",2

I know it’s all my fault for drinking but I really have a huge uncontrollable problem.

I've cut down from drinking until I pass out daily, to only drinking socially. Which has meant that I have  had drinks on two occaisions in the last 7 weeks. 

The first time I had dinner in a pub on my own and had a single pint of cider, and I was fine.

The second time was bad... 

I have a lot of anxiety in social situations, and tend to drink to compensate for it. 

That night I mixed drinks with lorazepam, and I got messy. I drank until the bar cut me off, I drank to cope with creepy men being creeps, and I drank to manage my anxiety.

Because of the drinking I allowed a man to degrade me and behave completely inappropriately with me.

I drank so much that I barely remember any of the night, but the one thing I do remember is wetting myself while stumbling into my apartment and I have no idea whether the friend who drove me home saw what happened.

I barely remember the night, but I have so much shame about it that I don't know if/when I'm going to be able to face seeing my friends again.

I think the only thing I can do is just stop drinking completely. Or at least until I can do so in moderation, if that's even possible.

I just want to be able to go out and have a good time with my friends, without waking up hungover and ashamed the next day.",9

Been drinking for about 6 yrs, since 28, met my current girlfriend at 30 (we both like to drink) I drank heavily for the first 3 yrs of our relationship (prob 6-10 drinks a night), but I was functional, still exercised every day, never dank before about 7pm, was sober by morning, always at work 8am. Then pandemic came,March 2020 got sent home for remote work. That's when it started to get worse. Before maybe once every few months I'd have a few glasses of wine in morning, but was rare. After lockdowns started, started doing more, still got all my work done even tho, many days now I wasn't sober until 10am-2pm. 

This summer, gf started working (call it daycare) said ""no drinking during the week"" so there were periods when I didn't drink for 5 days at a time,then Fri-Sat come, we'd drink, but many days I couldnt stop on Sun. She had enough said we're not together anymore, would stay at friends' homes for a couple days at a time, last wk she was gone for two days, came back Sun acting normal but then I kept drinking, blacked out. She left Monday morning, came back Tue night. We’ve been back in the office since June, I called in sick Mon, drank that morning, then got a text from boss we’re remote again on Tue. Woke up maybe 6am Tue, had a few shots, forgot I had a meeting at 930am (w ppl from other companies). Boss texted me at 7am if I could make the remote meeting, said yes, stopped drinking – did some work for about an hour, then waited for meeting. Meeting started, got through introductions, initial announcements, then blacked out for remaining of the 2 hrs. I don’t ever talk during those meetings, but I prob missed a couple votes. Past mtgs I’ve been buzzed, but never blacked out before.

Gf came home for the wk,things seemed good, but now she’s gone Fri, prob won’t be back till Sun. Finally realized (too late) I just can’t drink at all because I can’t stop, havent since Tue. Anyway, even tho not drinking this weekend, may have really fucked up this time, girlfriend gone, maybe lost her for good.",37

I didn't vibe with the 12 step program so I started looking into SMART Recovery. On the SMART recovery website, it says there is one meeting in my town and listed the guys contact information. I have emailed and called multiple times but have never been able to get ahold of the guy who is supposedly in charge. I blame it on covid and not updating the website to make me feel better. I'm hesitant to join an online group. I know you don't need to turn on your camera or mic and can just listen, but I was really hoping for some actual human contacts and closer distanced relationships that could relate to and help me. Obviously, an in-person SMART recovery group isn't going to happen so how helpful are online groups? I feel like at this point it might not be helpful because I normally drink while alone, sitting at my computer and playing games, and if my camera and mic are off, I would be staying in the same environment and it would be so easy to just sneak drinks while I'm listening to others. I suppose the obvious answer is to turn on my camera and mic but that seems so embarrassing and I'd feel put on the spot. Can anyone relate or does anyone have any advice?",2

But also even worse as he is coherent the next day and acts as if F all happened, I’m not sure how I can convince him to potentially even just lower the volume of alcohol. Even that would help, he goes from being a nice drunk to absolute **** in a glass of wines difference. The man is a great man, worked hard all of his life, we recently have had re homing and issues with finance as my mum got cancer (which she beat thankfully) and my dad got laid off from his job due to covid and looking after my mum.

So what's the little idiot do? He brings like six people over to try to jump me. Now I'm living with my wife's family and they're a bunch of looney tunes but they're mostly okay and form a community, and now I'm drinking again because what's a couple beers among friends?

I started drinking in college, just on the weekends (not every weekend, but pretty frequent). I’ve had a pretty high tolerance since the start, so its easy for me to throwback a few shots and be buzzed… but it has also landed me in a few blackout situations. But after this weekend, what I’m just realizing is that 99.99% of the time when I blackout, it’s because I’m receiving attention from a man. In fact, the first time I ever blacked out was because of this very reason (at 20).

If I’m hanging out with friends I can easily have a few beers and call it a day… but as soon as I get some advances from someone I’m interested in, I start throwing back shots like it’s my job.

After work I can’t seem to control myself. The biggest problem I have is, I will give myself a limit and exceed it EVERY time. I have no off switch, more often than not I wake up going, “fuck I did it again!” 

My worst moments are when I think I am okay to drive and drive when I shouldn’t and that makes me / my behavior unacceptable. The amount of danger I have put myself and others in is something I will have to deal with. I have never gotten a DUI or injured my family or random individuals, thank the universe! My lives are running out and I owe it to my family and myself to grow up and face reality. 

I was 3 days sober and then I played some mental gymnastics and now I am back to square one. What is wrong with me, I told myself today that I feel great. I think faster, I eat better and I have more energy when alcohol is not in me or on the horizon. But somehow I can’t seem to keep putting poison in myself no matter the situation.

This is my first day of being sober in a long time. I've tied to get rid of my ""bad habits"" so often. But unfortunately, I'm a person who gets addicted quite easily, I guess. Everytime I tried to quit drinking (or earlier on: smoking), I jump right into a new bad habit (addiction).

So after a couple of rough years I ended up obese. And now everytime I stop drinking for some days, I start binge eating. I'm craving everything. But mainly because I feel like I need something to ""fill this whole"" which is left without drinking. Do you know what I mean?

I was wondering if some of you could share with me how you filled that hole? Because I feel like nothing worked for me so far. I've tried meditation, sports, drinking tea instead and whatever. But I still feel like there's this hole that needs fo be filled.

And above that, how long will this feeling last?

I deeply hope that I can find some answers and a supportive community here, because I've told nobody about my drinking problem yet. I feel too guilty and ashamed..

After removing her from her living conditions citing that it was the cause of her depression that led to drinking. We have lived in our new apartment for less than a month it was discovered that she had been drinking everyday when I had to work, I work for an airline and have had to work 10-16hr days. This last time she became confrontational without being provoked and proceeded to consume to a point where keys had to be taken away as I feared for her safety. Although before it has resulted in bids of anger and yelling this time it became physical. I have never been this close to alcoholism and I'm just not sure if she has fallen to the point where she wants help or if I'm simply powerless in supporting this struggle. She refuses AA because she believes it to be based in religion. At this point it has put a strain on my relationship with my children, my family, and my friends.

I swore to myself I'd never drink, and my dad and family urged me to never drink because ""I had the gene."" So up until I was 32 I can count on one hand the times I drank alcohol, and they were a glass of cheap boxed wine, a glass of wine on an international flight, a sip of Blue Moon, and a Redbull + Vodka mixed drink. Everything was fine, though I kept all of this from my family because I know they would overreact.

Last summer during the height of covid, my girlfriend bought some vodka. I did some shots. And for the first time in my life I was buzzed and then drunk. It quickly became a problem as I'd do shots every time any sort of stressful situation arose, and then started doing shots just for fun. By December she demanded I not drink anymore, and I agreed. A few times that agreement was broken and I drank on nights where an unexpected stressful situation arose. The last time I drank vodka in front of her was 2 months ago. Since then I've only had an occasional Mike's Hard Lemonade in front of her.

The problem I'm facing right now, is that I use that Mike's as a smokescreen to do shots in secret in my walk-in closet. I usually wait for her to fall asleep and then I go out for a Coke Zero from Circle K and then do shots until I black out. I don't want to drink anymore. I'm literally crying right now every time I get up and walk to that closet. I get anxiety when I'm sober going into that closet. I get anxiety she's going to find out I've been drinking vodka this whole time. But every night like clockwork I go out for a drink at 11:30 to midnight and when I get back I start taking shots. I don't even remember my nights anymore.

I'm gaining weight from drinking so much. My confidence is shot. I'm miserable all the time craving a drink. But then when I do drink I hate myself over it and it's disgusting. I don't like any of this. I keep trying to quit and not drink but it feels like it's an automated process. I drink 10-15 shots a night. And I have no one I can talk to. I'm sorry for dumping all this on you all.

I talked to my therapist about rehab yesterday and she gave me some resources that I've slowly been working on calling, but I have a few more questions before I commit to going or talking to my employer about it. First, how do I know wether I should do inpatient or outpatient? There's a lot of good things for both and I really have no idea what's best and where to even begin trying to figure it out. Next, is it really worth going if I'm not fully committed to it? Half of me really wants to quit and the other half knows I need to, but doesn't want to. I feel like I might be setting myself up for failure by going when I'm not 100% in the headspace of quitting and I don't want to have to pay $1,500 out of pocket and get nothing out of because I wasn't ready. Any advice or stories you guys have for me would be much appreciated!",2

Apologies for a bit of a confusing title because I can't seems to find any information. So I have been suffering with alcoholism for a long time already. I never had DTs and tend to drink beer as my choice. I do breaks, but that's not the point. For a while now I have what I would call kindling? I can only drink 2 days in a row and feel okay, anything more than 3 days in a row makes me feel bad like shakes, sweats etc. 

One of the most unique and strange things I experience is a dull pain in lower abdomen, inside maybe an inch bellow belly button. if I had to guess what it is maybe intestinal cramps. What is weird it only happens as I try to fall asleep. If I am awake I feel fine but once I start to drift off to sleep it comesback and this back and fourth is all night, won't let me sleep. Has anyone else experienced this?

I tried meds for bloating, cramps, nothing works. It usually last 1-2 nights and passes. I assumed it is trapped gas as I can hear bubbling down there quite often.  Yes I did try docs, they are clueless.",5

I guess I was a bit confused, and when I asked her if that meant my liver wasn’t totally fucked yet and she said even if it’s still functioning normally, we don’t know if there’s any scarring until the ultrasound. 

I thought my anxiety would go away after I got my blood test results but after hearing about the ultrasound my anxiety stayed the same…I’m going to have the ultrasound soon but I’m panicking since there’s still some time until my appointment so I was wondering if anyone can share their experience or help me understand.

""We are allergic to alcohol.""

This phrase has helped myself and my wife understand a bit more about my illness. 

I am allergic to gluten, if I eat it I get seriously ill, no matter how delicious or good it makes me feel in the moment. Long term, if I do not avoid gluten it can result in serious health conditions. So I am super strict over what I eat and avoid gluten at all costs. It helps me to think of alcohol in this way, I am allergic to it, it is bad for my health no matter how great it tastes in the moment, it is detremental on my day to day life and will result in serious health conditions.",21

Most days I was drinking either 2 bottles of wine, or 3/4 of a fifth of gin. Towards the end I was polishing off a fifth of gin a day. Some days I would just have one beer though. 
I slowed down on Saturday, and yesterday I just had 2 20oz. White Claws, haven’t had any alcohol in over 24 hours and I’ve been drinking a lot of water today.
I feel fatigued, bloated, and I’ve been unusually anxious. I tried to nap earlier but my heart started racing and I felt super anxious. I just had dinner, and feel even more bloated than before. I’ve never had any withdrawal symptoms before so I was looking shit up and apparently you can have seizures from this shit; are seizures something I should be worried about?
I haven’t slept properly in a month due to being in Ireland visiting family, which is where I did the bender. I also got Covid during that time and was drinking to deal with the stress and family tension around having Covid. I’m really hoping my fatigue is mainly from my lack of a good sleep in so long. Is it negligent of me to think I can’t have very bad withdrawals due to my age and the length of the bender?
I keep my drinking hidden from my family, the only person who knows about it is my alcoholic friend who lives down in LA(I live in NorCal). 
Am I being overly paranoid or should I come clean and tell my family in case something bad happens?",5
2021-08-09 20:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/p1ehw2/i_wanted_this_off_my_chest/,I Wanted This Off My Chest,"Alcohol withdrawal is the stuff of nightmares, man. Hell on Earth. Near the end of my run I had to convince myself I wasn't scared of dying, but in reality I was scared shitless every waking moment my eyes were open. That's what that shit does to you, it's a cruel mistress.

It pulls you in and says ""just a couple beers, no harm no foul... You'll cop a buzz of euphoria and I'll leave you alone."" But it never ends that way. ""You knowwwww you want more. Just one more. Just ONE more. A six pack. Fuck it! Let's see how far we can go with it.... Tomorrow? That's tomorrow's problem! Let's get some serious stuff. Let's get a fifth of Jack.""

Thus starts the endless rotation of living hell. You wake up at 4:00 AM after 2 hours of sleep, drenched in sweat, heart racing, bloated, and run to the bathroom to throw up constantly, some of it blood, some of it bile; because you haven't had food for 36 hours. You know at this point you'll be throwing up for two days. You won't be able to keep water down let alone food. The thought of alcohol makes you gag, but there is nothing short of benzos and rehab care that will fix you.

The 24 hour gas station is open, but they can't sell booze until 7:00AM. Fuck. I still have a couple half cans of beer and a squirt of liquor left... Oh and some mix drinks sitting out that will be flat as hell and disgusting. So you chug down the rest of your secondhand shit to cop a buzz enough to sleep; but it's not sleep. Eyes closed and briefly unconscious, not recharging. Body jumping at every little sound.

You see, the brain adapts to everything. When you've been drunk for days, it becomes hyper excitable (read: seizures). It will adapt slowly without alcohol, and that's the worst part of withdrawing.

After you're forcibly awakened, stone sober, it's the walk of shame. You walk into the store looking disheveled as fuck with burst blood vessels on your face from vomiting, haven't showered for days, probably sweating enough booze that others can smell, these others being normal human beings getting coffee or gas for a normal day of work while you're trying to hide your suffering.... Holding back vomit and desperately trying to be normal.... When in reality you are close to death without your fix. You're a regular, and you keep the stores on rotation so it's less embarrassing. But it's still fucking depressing that you know that they know. You feel so bad that you want to just kick, meaning deal with the withdrawals and get through, but it is literal hell on Earth. You just want it to stop. Please God, just stop this.

You finally give in to the mistress's demands and just choke down your newly acquired booze to stop the withdrawals. Only, it doesn't stay down. You're hanging over the toilet or sink chugging vodka, and only 25% of it actually hits your bloodstream. Most of it ends up regurgitated because your body is sick and inflamed from the poison. Once your heart stops flopping around in chest, which usually takes at least 10 drinks at least and 5 hours of agony, you get dirty drunk. In my mind, dirty drunk is being inebriated enough to somewhat function but still feel like absolute garbage and knowing that it won't last without a constant influx of booze.

This is legal? A legal drug? People are addicted to heroin, cocaine, and pot (don't even start with me) but they are legal. I know first hand how deadly alcohol is. I'm barely alive now because of the shit it's put me through, not to mention the emotional side (which bares repeating). I don't condone any toxic lifestyle but I'm sick (literally) about alcohol.

I’m 23(f) live at home with my parents and sister (22). All my life my Dad has been an alcoholic, he drinks every night (i can’t remember a night that he hasn’t in all my life). He drinks wine and beer at the same time he’ll probably do 6/7 beers and glasses of wine a night. 

Grew up with domestic violence from both parents, due to drinking mainly from my dad, my mum used to blame it on his stressful job. Over the past decade they don’t physically fight any more, but do verbally. My mum doesn’t drink every night but when she takes it too far on a weekend she usually ends up arguing with one of us. She screamed at my sister on Saturday night over nothing whilst i was out and my sister has had enough, she phoned me crying at 1am (she doesn’t drink, probably due to witnessing the shit show alcohol can cause). 

My mum has admitted she’s starting to crave alcohol and has asked my Dad not to buy it, to which he ignores her. 

About a year ago is the first time my Dad admitted he was an alcoholic, i told him he would die due to it and he said he doesn’t care and enjoys drinking. He obviously drinks to mask his trauma and emotions and at this point needs professional help. My sister has tried to speak to him again today, and he has shut her down “why are you putting pressure on me, i’m not stopping drinking”. He retires at the end of this year and i’m worried about it getting worse when he’s not working, at the weekends he’ll sleep in till midday because he’s hungover and i’m worried he’ll do the same when he’s not got a job to go to. 

How can we approach the subject without him shutting down? I’m worried about his health, he’s 52 and ill be shocked if he makes it to 60. I don’t want my Dad in an early grave. Please help all advice is welcome.",3

Like the title says, I’m worried that I may be in danger of being/am an alcoholic. Right now I think I can control it to an extent. Monday through Friday I can go without drinking but on weekends I breakdown. I can easily go through a bottle of bourbon and multiple beers over Saturday and Sunday. I can easily see myself as thinking I have things under control when I actually don’t. In the past I’ve had trouble with depression and I’ve also had trouble sleeping. I feel like I’ve sometimes taken to alcohol to cope or fall asleep.

For the past three or so years, I've been drinking anywhere between 1/4 and 1/2 a bottle of whisky every night. There was a period about a year ago where I took a few months off. 

Other than a mild craving to drink at night (which was my pattern) and perhaps some moderate irritability, I'm not having any other symptoms stopping cold turkey. I'm on day 5. 

I'm just curious if anyone has opinions on why it hasn't been harder for me to stop? Surely I was drinking enough to cause issues. Am I just lucky not to have serious withdrawal? I didn't have withdrawal last time I stopped either.

I've been waking up feeling like a million bucks, and after I eat now, I don't know how to describe it, it feels great. I feel pretty good about stopping this time. I've just had enough of this crap.

I wish anyone wanting to stop all the best!",10

They would all say stuff like “it gets easier!” “it gets so much better!” and it felt like it was possible for everyone except me. I felt like without drinking, i would be even more depressed. I barely had a will to live. I thought I would never be able to have any fun or joy without drinking. I finally told my psych everything and got prescribed naltrexone and upped my meds. my cravings are GONE. GONE!! It literally doesn’t allow you to get drunk. so i take it every morning so i don’t have the chance to change my mind. It was rough on me at first so i split the dosage in half and slowly started taking the full dose.

We have been great friends for most of my life. Basically we are the Gilmore Girls if Lorelai always had a glass of wine in her hand.

For those of you familiar with the show, my Mother's relationship with my grandmother (her mother) is very similar to that of Lorelai and her mother Emily. They have harbored resentment towards eachother for longer than I have been alive. My Mother did not receive the love that she needed as a child and she seems to believe that she has experienced something that no one else can possibly understand. 

I have noticed a pattern of hers that has become very frustrating in my adult years. It always happens after she has surpassed her third drink. 

Her inner monologue becomes external and she launches into this whole narrative about what a terrible mother my grandmother was and how she never felt loved as a child. When it seems that it is my turn to respond, I sometimes say that I can relate when it comes to not being loved the way that I needed by my father, and then I explain how I learned to accept him for the person that he is and to stop setting myself up for disappointment by letting go of my expectation of him to be something that he is not. 

These kinds of comments are always met with her saying something to the effect of ""...but it's really not the same"" or ""...but you're grandmother was so much worse"" or ""...but you really don't understand"". 

The neverending monologue usually continues in this fashion, going around in circles and having the same conversation we have had a thousand times in my life. 

It happened last night and I finally lost it and yelled at her for the first time in 12 years. I yelled about how I'm her daughter, not her mother, not her therapist. I also told her that she needs to go back to a therapist because it is so disheartening to watch her carry this pain around with her and that it is so frustrating to listen to the same conversation every time we are together and to feel like I am wasting all this energy to help her talk this out when clearly, she is not willing to take responsibility for any of her feelings and make any changes to how she approaches this problem. 

I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I don't think any of what I said even sunk in. I guess I'm here wondering if anyone else out there has dealt with something similar and if there might be some literature or information out there somewhere that would help me learn more about the dynamics of what is happening and how to navigate these conversations.

I recently have been feeling that ""willingness"" switch with the bottle...I'm not 100% convinced I need to stop - or at least my subconscious mind isn't - but it's getting curious. So tired of feeling foggy and wiped-out and unable to muster the memory of what I did last night. Getting on the wife's last nerve, as well. 

I've been thinking about trying Antabuse -- I think it's easier for me psychologically just to know it's ""not an option,""-kind of thing, rather than hoping I don't end up craving it... (a la Naltrexone and so forth). 

Anyway, I take adderall for a very real and debilitating case of ADHD, and I am very concerned that if I admit to needing help with alcohol, my pscyh is going to say it's not safe for me to continue with the adderall. I know medical advice isn't allowed -- my question is whether anyone has been in a situation like this-- I *\*cannot\** lose the adderall and function. But I also can't keep drinking like this.  

Additionally, any advice about dealing with implications for health insurance would be appreciated. Is my insurance going to flag me or something and deny me treatment if I get a diagnosis of ""alcoholism?""",2

So I have been abusing alcohol since I was about 15-16, I’m now 28. It started off as binge drinking and drinking more regularly than I should.

I had a couple periods where I drank everyday for months at a time but usually settled back down to 2-4 times a week.

The past 2 years I have drank every day, usually half a bottle of whisky, up to a full bottle.. rarely much more than that.

I have a 6 month old son, and I really want to be done with this shit now. The problem with that is, I am worried about going for any help in case it causes me any problems with social services.

I’m doing okay so far, starting day 3 now and I’m feeling okay, but some serious mental gymnastics going on to justify having a drink.

I’ve been taking a load of supplements to help, and I’m curious if any has had any experience with these and what their opinions are.

I’m taking:

Glutamine to help with cravings

DLPA to help with mood elevation

Magnesium citrate to help with anxiety and in general to help relax/sleep

A regular multivitamin 

A high strength vitamin b complex 

And vitamin d because apparently we are all deficient in that

I think they’re helping.. I’m not sure.. not sure if I’m overdoing but maybe worthwhile for a couple weeks if it feels like it’s helping?

I'm 23, I've been drinking like this since I was 18. I thought about it the other day and I can barely remember a time since I was 18 where I have had more than two days off in a row, and I'm not just drinking a few drinks every night, I average about 8 drinks a night, but it can go a lot higher, I don't know how it's gotten to this point....

My first question is, is it possible to get to a point where I can have just a few drinks with family & friends or do I have to go completely sober? 

I come from a big Irish family, both sides drink, alot at every family gathering. All of my work colleagues are heavy drinkers, and being new to the job I feel as if it's the only way I connect with them. Plus seeing friends at this age always leads to binge drinking. 

I want to be able to go out with them and have one or two drinks and not have to keep going. I'm just not sure if it's possible, I have tried but I just don't seem to have the will power. 

Secondly I want to get help, I really do. I've tried doing it on my own and I cant. But I have recently moved to a small town and I'm worried if I go to a meeting people will talk. Is this a valid concern? Do I have any other options?

Lastly, my partner drinks as much as I do, he wants to stop too but we're finding it to be harder as a team. If one of us gives up and drinks. We both do, I'm not sure how we can work around that.

this person (33M) I know for a long time since college has lost his father about 2 weeks ago and understandably, he is still grieving. as someone who lost his father (although more than 10 years ago), I know it hurts. but he has increased his daily drinking by a LOT and it concerns me. he drinks 2 litres of red wine, or 12 cans of beer in one day and he thinks it's ok because it's over long hours (starts drinking at 10am and keeps on drinking until the supply for the day is dry), ""red wine is healthy"" and says I shouldn't judge, and I am certain to be met with his recent catchprase ""MY DAD DIED, OK!?""

as I mentioned earlier I too lost my dad a little over 10 years ago and I FULLY understand how it hits you where it hurts when your loved one dies, and everyone has different ways to handle grief, but I must admit my friend in question may have it harder than I did because my dad died suddenly of brain aneurysm, undiagnosed til he died. my friend's dad died of multiple cancers and he fought for a year, so the stress on his family was high.

I am no way saying someone should just ""get over"" a parent's death within a set timeframe because there is no such thing. but using that as an excuse to consume large amount of alcohol? I don't think that is the answer either.

&#x200B;

TBH I don't know why I am posting this here. to ask if 2L of wine or 12 cans of beer is too much? to ask if he is becoming alcoholic? I really don't know. maybe it's just a rant. but I am worried about his health because I have known him since we were students.

They will never fully understand it until they are there but it helps to know so you can think about helping someone else. You can relate to them that you atleast understand some of it. It doesn't help when people don't know and think you're lying just to get more alcohol when really you just need to talk about it and have them watch you incase it quickly gets really bad which you should know within 72hrs(danger zone). Or just make the judgment to take you to the hospital and get an iv and maybe a prescription for some Librium(don't take any other benzo especially xanax) and maybe spend a few days in the hospital. Sometimes it's hard to make the decision alone. I recommend looking up all the withdrawal symptoms including d.t's. And never assume they are too young.

I couldn't keep it up anymore. I never drank that much in my life and I was starting to notice my body wasn't feeling good, ever. And it had really bad mental effects too. 
My boyfriend asked me to quit with him for 1 month in April, but May came and we were both drinking again. He started drinking heavier than I'd ever seen (we've been together for 1 year). 
Then last month, he told me he had been experiencing bloody stools (dark, clotted). I panicked because I know that's a symptom of a bleed farther up the GI tract. He still wouldn't stop drinking or go to the doctor. 
It made me realize how serious the disease of alcoholism is, and since then I haven't even been tempted to drink any alcohol. I'm repulsed by it completely now. I hate it passionately. 
My boyfriend is spiraling, and I keep thinking I should break up with him because he's a completely different person now than when we started dating. He is sarcastic and cold to me, and lately it verges on emotional abuse (I had ACL reconstruction surgery last week and he's been a dick about me being needy). 
I started going to al-anon meetings, and I cry every time I go. 
I'm glad that I stopped drinking. Even if my inspiration to stop is pretty depressing.

*""...free from the effects of drugs and/or alcohol.""*

But I came across an additional definition, a follow up to the above, and it read like...

""*...the natural state of every human being when they are born.""*

I thought this was very interesting and I shared it with a friend who was beating themselves up about their addiction and being ""weak"" and a ""failure"". And I said to them...

It's not your fault. Most of us are not born wanting to abuse a substance of any kind. We learned it from somewhere. We inherited it. It was passed on to us somehow. So go easy on yourself. Beating yourself up will only feed the addiction, but if you accept that at one point you did not need alcohol you can get there again.

What do you think?

These risk factors interact differently in every individual, leading to alcohol use disorders in some and not in others.

Both internal and external factors contribute to the development of alcoholism. Internal factors include genetics, psychological conditions, personality, personal choice, and drinking history. External factors include family, environment, religion, social and cultural norms, age, education, and job status.

The sheer number of factors that can influence the development of an alcohol addiction make it virtually impossible to accurately predict whether any individual will develop alcoholism. While it is an individual’s personal choice whether or not to begin drinking, a great deal of research suggests that the **development of alcoholism once drinking commences is largely out of that individual’s control**. **It is also true that no single factor**, **nor group of factors**, **will determine whether or not someone becomes an alcoholic**.

guess I'll start with this...

My closest friends see me as brave and strong but everyday is hard for me. Maybe it doesn't show, because I don't try hard enough? If you're reading this.... I warn you, I don't know where it is going... I often refer to my conversations as dump trucks being unloaded. I don't know where to really begin but I'll start by telling you this... My family has been displaced since June. We currently have a place to stay and are safe and healthy but the window is quickly closing. The housing market for our hometown is slim. The only places suitable for our family are slum places in bad parts of town and we need to find a place to go by October. We moved out of our last residence because it was meant to be a temporary situation right before the start of covid19. The three of us- My spouse, our small chilld and our family pets (3 cats) were making it work in a tiny 1 BR apartment. It wasn't always easy but it was comfortable until we could find our new home.

Why were in a place so small....

My Husband and I have been together for 12 years. We dated for 6 before we were married and shortly after had our only child. A few months later my little brother overdosed and died from Heroin. This hit my family very hard. Divides began to form and with that brought dirty alliances among members in my family and my husband. This created many tensions in our relationship and a lot of hate in my husband. He began to change into an angry, narcissistic alcoholic. It was almost overnight when I felt our marriage had failed... he refused to do anything with the family or communicate with me... We fought constantly because he would dump his hatred for other people on me. He had reached a point where he hated my sister with all his vengeance and he would turn and tell me I was just like her. It became toxic very fast and before long we were living like roommates in a rundown trailer 30 minutes from our families and our jobs. Finally after years of turmoil during what was supposed to be the happiest time of our lives, I finally realized that life wasn't worth living that way and I left him in that run down trailer and I moved to a 1br apartment 15 minutes away. It took a lot for me to reach the point of no return but I had reached it. it took six more months before I was able to escape hell... Of course, perhaps like a fool, I took him back soon after he begged for redemption and promised to stay sober.... ""this is my husband.""

Now I may not be perfect and I come from a broken family however I have always found myself to be a Christian. A sinner and a believer. Growing up I didn't have many boyfriends, but there was that one guy I met when I was 16 and fell in love with. Pledged to spend the rest of my life with. My soul mate. I always told myself that it didn't matter if my sisters got all the attention, eventually when my time would come I'd find the one. He was - the one. On my 18th birthday that world changed when I nearly died in a MVA and had to turn to my racist family rather than my black boyfriend. It's a tale as old as time, written in the stars but destined to be apart. So life happened, and of course time separates people... We're still friends, but thousands of miles apart. Both married now, but the bond has never been broken. He is my best friend and knows me better than anyone else. Even after years of not talking to each other when we reconnected it was as if we'd never spent time apart.

I've always struggled to believe that happiness is truly a thing meant for me, but I met my husband and fell in love in a new kind of way. I felt that no matter what the two of us could take on the world together and nothing would ever change that. He supported me, took care of me when I was ill or suffering from chronic pain. We built a relationship together, a truly remarkable love story that I don't see ever really ending. It's never been easy though. We have fought with each other, with family, with friends and with life, but we have always loved stronger for it... until he changed.

When the alcohol really, truly took over him... I tried to bring him back but I had lost myself doing that. When I moved into that tiny 1 BR apartment with our child and left him in the trailer I became like a zombie living in paradise. It was a great, comfortable space. I set it up in a nautical theme and insisted on living every moment there in tranquility after he moved in with us. We began to fall in love again... & then I caught him talking to other women online when he started accusing me of infidelity. (This wasn't the first time I had caught or suspected this behavior with him. It had happened before while living in the trailer.) Before marrying my husband I NEVER suspected him of being a cheater. When he started disappearing in the night and we weren't sleeping together for months... c'mon now? He still insists he's never been physically with someone but idk if I believe that... I don't know if I believe he isn't still talking to other women. I don't know if I would care if he left me for one of them? I don't know a lot of things.

So... the apartment sold and the new landlord is a ruthless business man looking to make a profit. New leases agreements needed to be signed within 28 days or residents were being evicted. We found hope in a home of family members for a temporary time while we look for another place but time is running out and the place is non existent. I do not want to leave my career and co-workers here and my husband can pretty much find a job anywhere as a mechanic or laborer or whatever.... I can likely transfer as I work a federal job that I am sure has openings all over the country. Our closest family is our only support network and its not huge. We have friends located in other areas and I've started reaching out to them about possibly relocating to a new area since we cannot seem to find something ideal here.

I've never had success moving out of state on my own and if we were to do this.... its not just me anymore or even him and I we have to think about our child also. But what good are we doing staying here and getting nowhere?",6

I originally posted to relationship_advice and a helpful commenter suggested I post here too. I hope that's ok 

I (F40) have a friend (F39) who is a recovering alcoholic. We meet up every couple of months or so as we both have busy lives but I would consider us close. After a series of disasters including a driving ban for drunk driving and the loss of a long-standing friendship with a mutual friend after she had a drunken row with the new in-laws (who were by no means blameless but didn't make a scene), I finally reached out and confronted her about the issue saying I could see alcohol ruining her life and she deserved better and begging her to get help. 

At first, she was hurt and angry but she then decided to get help (AA) and she has done so amazingly. She went to uni, got a degree in her chosen field (which she aced) and then secured wonderful job straight afterwards. She has been with her bf about a year now and they are talking about buying a place together. She's happy and successful and I'm so proud of all she has achieved through her hard work but most importantly I'm happy to see her happy. 

She has had setbacks along the way and has fallen off the wagon a couple of times, the worst being when she decided she could manage to drink socially and keep it under control. She has been completely frank about these times and after the social drinking thing concluded that she simply couldn't ever drink as that was the only way to keep in control (things spiralled very quickly that time). 

We met for dinner a few days ago to belatedly mark my birthday (outdoors, both vaxxed) and she ordered a wine spritzer with dinner. I was very taken aback but she just said she ""must have one to mark the occasion"". I don't drink myself and had ordered a soda so that made it even odder. In the course of the conversation it became clear that she and her bf regularly have a glass of wine with dinner. I didn't know what to say and I didn't want to offend her or stick my nose in but I'm so worried this will be massively problematic for her. 

My understanding is that recovering alcoholics simply cannot/should not drink at all. The last time she decided she cope with being a social drinker she ended up unconscious being carried out of a nightclub with a newish friend who thankfully was decent enough to stay with her until her father collected her. 

She is an adult and very intelligent and capable but honestly the more I think about it the more uncomfortable I feel about not saying anything. She is much happier and in a positive relationship now and I do think her drinking was connected with her being deeply unhappy in the past. But I am very concerned for her. So I guess the advice I'm looking for is: should I say anything and if so, how should I say it? How can/should I help her? And am I right to be so worried or am I overreacting? 

I don't want to hurt her but I don't want to see her going down a bad road either. Thanks in advance you guys.",2

I went up to my best friends lake house this weekend and I gotta be honest I thought it was gonna be awful. I don’t think I’ve ever spent a night there sober in my life…but I had a great time and didn’t ever feel left out of the party. My friends are the greatest people on earth. When I told them I was trying not to drink for a bit they kinda teased me a little at first, but it was all in good fun. They never judge me for anything and always have my back no matter what. I love them to death. 

Also, my buddy’s gf brought her friend and I guess she’s not that much of a drinker (major stoner tho lol) so we ended up hangin out all night. She’s smokin fuckin hot, really down to earth, and she said she liked that I recognized I had a problem and was man enough to address it. I feel like most people would try to avoid someone who openly admits to something like that , especially this early on, so I guess I lucked out. We exchanged numbers and plan to hangout next weekend and I’m excited to see where this goes.

I recently completed treatment in, what I believe to be, the Shangri La of rehab; not because of the accommodations but because of the approach.

This being my 6th run at residential treatment so I have some experience with different venues. Typically the programs I’ve attended are AA heavy and push the 12 steps almost exclusively with a smattering of CBT and DBT.  The one I just attended did have those components but additionally focused heavily on spiritual development and the importance of community.  A great deal of focus was on mindfulness, mediation, and ACT.

The difference I feel, post completion, is very different than in the past. As I said I’m cautious optimistic as I haven’t even hit thirty days yet (most recently I had 4.5 years).  

The collective attempts garnered me much education which expanded my repertoire of coping skills, the prior knowledge gained not withstanding, the focus on self reflection and mindfulness has given me a feeling of contentment I have not known in years.

I thought it important that I share that for those who are suffering or are feeling hopeless at the daunting task of setting your monkey free. It is incumbent on all of us to keep each other alive and cared for.  There is hope, it’s not easy, but then again nothing worth while ever is.

I said I wouldn't, I said I wouldn't let it become a problem, but things got out of hand. I believed that I took a paracetamol overdose a couple of days ago and not as a suicide attempt, just plain dumbfuckery - I didn't, at least I don't think I did any more, for the most part - But 3 days. A 3 fucking day bender, 20 Corona beers and 1 litre of captain Morgan. my sister left for her friend's after day 1, and today is day 3. I'll admit it. I have a problem. I don't get violent when drunk and I don't drink and drive, but I turn into a cunt. A cunt that drinks so I don't have to think.

Where do I go from here? I live in South Wales (UK), who do I turn to in my area to get help? I'm depressed and I feel like a failure and I know I can't keep drinking to oblivion because sooner or later someone will get hurt and I'll probably die, I'm tired and I want this struggle to end. My mother has buried one kid, please help me before I become number 2.",3

On antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds. Still feel like I'm getting nowhere. But my point is I've been thinking about going to an AA or similar group because I cope with alcohol and other substances and have for years.. I feel like I would insult the people at those though. I'm  not a daily drinker and haven't been but I'll go on sprees for about a week every now and then. Or sometimes I'll just drink myself until I can't feel anything just for one night. It's a problem sure but I feel like if I go to a group of some kind I'll be looked at as if I'm ""trying"" to be a part of something I'm not fucked up enough to be in if that makes sense. I also feel like the source of my issues aren't bad enough to go seek that out. Like I've had one manipulative relationship, but my parents love me. I've had close friends die but all through illnesses. I haven't truly experienced what others would say is a ""traumatic"" event. And yet I can't stop going back into the same cycle of being okay for a few weeks then binging off something for a few days to a week, then being okay, etc....
Maybe it's just what I've seen or heard from TV and movies but I'm not someone who has been drinking everyday for 5 years and have taken thousands from family and friends ya know. 
I need to try something though cus I recently got to a point where I just wanted to end everything but I can't cus that would destroy my family and friends and I know how that looks from experience. If they weren't around I'd just un-alive myself and I don't want to feel like this anymore. But it's been so long since I've felt truly happy or content unless I've been intoxicated somehow.",2

My health was in rapid decline, obviously. I couldn’t continue to live like that, literally. Looking back with a sober mind, I can’t believe I would do something like that just to get drunk.

What’s yours?",42

I’m scared of how well I seem to be doing.",2
