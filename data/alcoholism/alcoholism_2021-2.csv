I called the cops.,"After 5 years with a binge drinking abuse alcoholic I called the cops. I don’t necessarily feel good about it but after a 12 hour bender and showing up at our house unannounced. After I told him he was not welcome and not hearing from him he just arrives and kicks our front door in obliterating it. He’s done this 4 times, in accordion to every door in my house looks like it’s been shot by an uzi because of his drunken rage. Oh and my two cars he’s smashed in the last two years. Has done jail time and he loved it.
Binge drinking is one of the worst things I’ve ever encounter. Your partner seems great back to their old self and then one day they just can’t stop drinking and lying. Idk what to do from here which is why I’m here, cops were called he’s on probation he caused so much damage he’s not welcome here and I have to get an order of protection (cops words). Do I call his mom for the millionth time about her 40 year old son, do I call his friends he’s hiding out with? Like I’m so lost. Getting the calls he was in jail was more relieving than wondering if he’s prowling around waiting to come back. He’s violent too. So besides the cops am I on my own? I have no where to go: I barricaded the door he broke the best I could but I’m terrified. I’m not an alcoholic and he’s threats are endless idk what he could be capable of and what I should do: please

My dad is 64 and has been a alcoholic for my entire life (I am 26) and was an alcoholic way before then. I know that he started drinking when he was 14, and probably drank regularly once he turned 18, so that means for about 50 years he has been abusing that liver.

For some personal backstory: I also started drinking when I was 14, and became an alcoholic when I was 18 and drank heavily daily for about 14 months, but thankfully came to my senses and decided to taper myself off and quit and became a massive pothead instead. Since then I have ""relapsed"" and drank a few times during special / rare occasions but have thankfully never drank more than 2 days in a row, let alone falling back into the pattern I was in before. But since my dad has become ill I have decided I need to quit 100% forever. I would not have been able to achieve this without cannabis.

I have tried for years to get my dad to do the same, but now finally he has turned completely yellow, can barely walk, and has a host of other issues... He has gone in recently for blood work but is waiting to hear back from the lab. Meanwhile he is continuing his regular vodka consumption and eating less and less.

I live 600 miles (11 hours) north from my parents, and it would be a logistical challenge right now for me to go see him one last time, and I just am wondering if anyone here could guesstimate how long they think he might have. (if he doesn't end up shooting himself before it gets real bad.)

I feel like it cannot be much longer.. I had noticed a few years ago that his long and short term memory had almost become non-existent even in the morning when he was mostly sober, but it is even worse now.

Maybe a year ago his pancreas was determined to be ""less than half functioning"", and since then he has lost most of his mobility due to lack of blood flow to his feet and legs. He has fallen and hit his head several times and a few months ago broke his nose and his entire face was swollen and purple for 3 months.

My mom sent me a picture of him yesterday and he is quite yellow, but not quite Homer Simpson. She has not mentioned any abdominal swelling yet, but I also haven't asked.

Throughout my entire life he has had little control of his bowels and I hear now he has absolutely none.

Maybe these symptoms will help you identify how late stage he is.

I am not posting this looking for condolences, my dad and I have had a very difficult relationship over the years and he has caused my mom a lot of undue stress and probably has shortened her life.

I guess to be honest the main reason I am asking you this is out of morbid curiosity.",2
2021-02-27 20:55:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lu2op3/question_about_withdrawal_symptoms/,Question About Withdrawal Symptoms.,"Hey all,

So I’ve been trying really hard to stop drinking the past few weeks. I’ve been drinking every day for about a year now. In my heaviest I was drinking 6-8 beers a night, nothing absolutely insane but still a decent amount of beer for a guy who weighs 145lbs. I started weaning down and got down to about 2 beers a night. That was until I caught Covid on the 16th. I went cold turkey since then and that’s where my questions come into play. I had Covid pretty bad so it was difficult to tell what was withdrawal and what was Covid. I had some sweating and vomiting but that only lasted a day. I noticed my anxiety has been incredibly out of control and so has my OCD. I’ve also been having some weird facial twitching. It’s now been 10 days since my last drink and I’m terrified of DT’s because I decided to start Googling like an idiot. Is there any chance of developing any more serious withdrawal symptoms at this point? Or am I pretty much in the clear? Thank you guys for any personal experiences or insight. Take care",1

She has been an alcoholic for a very long time, and was once in a coma for a month after taking a bottle of pills and a bottle of wine many years ago. 

She has been living back home for the past two months after doing heroine, crack, meth ect with her abusive boyfriend for more than six months. It’s obvious to me now she is not doing these intense drugs anymore because when she first moved back home she tried making a phone call on the tv and was extremely confused, and now she is just her regular amount confused 

I think either she has started up drinking again and/or her liver is about to die, because I wake up in the middle of the night every night to her throwing up for half and hour. She is extremely depressed currently I think because of her extremely emotionally and physically abusive father, who recently threatened to hurt me after I fought him off my boyfriend, and a shitty mother who sat back and watched and said it was all my boyfriends fault (I can imagine if someones parents told them over and over again how much they hate their kid, they might want to start up drinking) She has struggled with depression all her life though. I’m prepared for the worst because she has never successfully stayed sober, it’s safe to assume she is probably drinking again, right?

I just want to know specifics of what is going on with her body and how much longer she will live. Once she is dead all he will only have is his brother and sister. Their dads side of the family no longer speaks to them after they all came out about their father’s molestation of when they were little kids (and all of them let their children be around him even though they know what they did sad lmao)",19

I haven’t lost much weight so I don’t have that as a “visual motivator” to continue with a third month. 

Mostly, I’ve enjoyed the freedom that comes with taking alcohol off of the table. It dominated my brain space whether I was drinking or not (should I?, why did I?  do I have any? Should I run the packy? What is the best way to stop? Is stopping or moderation the best).

took SOOO much of my brain space. I used to even research WHILE drinking. 

I feel like I’m floating in space...unmoored from earth and alcohol. I haven’t been wicked focused, or heathy or positive. I’ve just been in a “float” state of being. Pounding good seltzer and looking at bicycles online.",5

I never drank much in my teens, 20s, or 30s. I don't know why, but started drinking harder about 10 years ago when I was 40. Then it got sloppy about 5 years ago. Seems reasonable to say it ended my best (6 year) relationship with a gf about 3 years ago. That's when I was binging around 8 to 15 drinks most nights. 

After the break up, I've been binging 15-20 shots a night 6-7 nights a week (honestly just a guess bc how does one keep track?). Arrested a few times for the obvious PI. Most nights I drink about 10 drinks at home and then head out. The next morning I only know where I went the night before by looking at my bank account and Uber rides. One reason I've been trying to slow down lately is because of the debt. I have a good job and I'm very, very lucky to have tenure as a professor. But the debt piles up when you wake up in the morning to find you spent $100, $200, and sometimes more the night before.

Things are getting better though! I no longer punch myself when drunk. Nor do I wake up to find all of my furniture flipped over. But I'm still glad to find this sub bc right now I'm trying to stop or slow down, and I still find myself drinking too much. It's slowed down to maybe 15 drinks 4-5 nights a week, but I want to improve more!

The initial drop was exhilarating and I strived to obtain that pleasureful feeling over...and over...and over again. Now it’s too difficult to feel that same way anymore since my resistance has gone up. Doing so would mean having to sacrifice whatever little dignities I have been holding onto. Don’t get me wrong...I am not the same alcoholic I used to be, but I have struggled to get off this damned ride since 2008 (about 13 years). And I’m tired, so tired.

My perspective on life has changed a lot recently, and my personal self has been going through a major re-haul. I am “Under Construction” and life has been a lot brighter since I’ve returned to college at 36 years old. For the first time, I have a worthy goal and I don’t feel like a total failure. However, the addiction has remained. Although I am mindful of steering clear of black-out moments and drunk driving, I still kept the continuous habit of drinking and prefer to do it alone, daily, in the comfort of my own home with no one around to judge me. I get tired, so tired. 

My intake can be anywhere from 1-6 beers a night. This is a lot better than when I was at my worst, but I am aware that it affects my abilities to get my schoolwork and daily responsibilities completed in time. Imagine the possibilities, what I would be capable of doing, if it weren’t for that little demon inside me whispering to,” Just go ahead and buy a case. You can drink only one beer! It will be easy!” But 9 times out of 10, I CAN’T have just one. So my day fades into night rather quickly, because alcohol makes me tired, so tired.

It is one of the worst feelings to have “graduated” to a functioning alcoholic from an incoherent one. I know that I can overcome this obstacle, but I don’t because there is always that glimmer of hope that I might be able to control that little demon fucker instead of getting rid of it completely....that it’s okay to have just one (more) drink. 

But he is a conniving one.
And he does not tire

I am currently tapering and the past two days I have only had one drink (prior to this it was anywhere from 4-8 a day, all day every day) 
I was extremely anxious and out of sorts during the first two days of tapering, and I think maybe one or two more days of a low amount of alcohol will help me get past the uncomfortable anxiety but the neuropathy is new and I only noticed it like three days ago. I am not concerned enough to go to a doc yet, but I am currently taking magnesium, NAC, and this airborne supplement everyday.

My dad and her sister are also a part of it, but I'm just so scared. I've now had to lie to my mom to get her to the place we're having it and I'm crushed. I'm extremely close to my mom and I know how much she's struggled. She's also had such a hard time forming friendships and I know this kid means well, but I think hanging out with him has really screwed with her head. She already got a MATCHING TATTOO WITH HIM. 

Just if anyone has gone through something like this with a parent (an intervention I mean) any advice would be appreciated. I don't want to hurt her, and we're not trying to put her in rehab or anything. She's quit drinking and smoking on her own before and it's stuck for 10+ years so I have no reason to believe it won't again with our help, but I'm so afraid she'll feel betrayed by us and go running back to her friend...",3

In the past year, I did have a few hiccups but was almost 90% sober. I have crippling social anxiety and I self medicated for 10+ years and drank heavily for 2 years. Alcohol made me a monster and it has permanently damaged the very few relationships I do have. From pissing on a friend's carpet, passing out at friend's graduation, crashing my sister's car and countless angry drunk calls and constant lies to family. I still do not know how to repair those lost relationships. Even thinking about what I had done or said inebriated spikes my anxiety",6

Im Gonna be honest I am not really sure what Im Looking for out of this but here I go. I drink about every day that I don't work. ( I work night shift) and it just got to the point the basically all I have time for. Because when I drink I almost always drink until I black out. Then the next morning Im Hung over. And trying to feel better. But even on days like that I'll start wanting to drink a couple hours I feel better. When was a teen I didn't drink a whole lot but smoked. And when I decided I wanted a better job I quite smoking. Butttt then I started substituting smoking with drinking. When this first started happened I was like 23 so I thought hey I am Just getting out the last of my young party years. Drinking on the weekends with friends. But it eventually got to a place where I lost most of my friends that would go out and party,over a fight that literally happened just because we were drunk. I thought to my self after hey this is a good thing I can focus better on school and I'll drink less because (at the time) I only do it in social occasion and not by myself. I progressively got worse and will drink buy myself mostly while I play video games or watch tv. I got to the point when I do have a couple friends I like to go to the bar with now. And Im not gonna lie I have fun drinking. I am normally shy but I am more talkive to people when I am drinking. Not that I have really made a long term friends from talking to them at a bar.
 But I have basically living the same day over and over for the last three years now. And it was fun but I want to move on and do something different. And change scares me. I got to a place where I am comfortable not happy and I do want more but I know I could be worse off. 
And I get bipolar about it like I wake up with good intentions but I crave to drink. Like in the morning I want to be clean and sober. But in the evening Im Like hey just have a couple enjoy yourself. Moderation is key but I go over board with it. I thought about going to an AA meeting but just the thought of speaking In Front of a bunch of people telling scares let alone me telling them about something I really don't like myself. I get that's the point of the meeting but I might just get anxious and shut down. 
I have a good heart and I want to be more productive. Trading smoking for drinking makes me want to trade drinking for something but I am not really passionate about anything. It's like I no I am not happy so I must do something about it but idk what to do. When I felt this way before I went to school and now I finished the degree but I still have a job in that career feild. So that can't be helping my confidence  and stopping drinking. more than over have the time I am so hung over on my days off I don't even apply for those jobs anymore. My family helped me so much to get threw school but know I am letting myself and them down. Well if anyone actually read this thing thanks for putting up with my rambling thoughts.",2

I read the book thinking it would help me moderate my drinking but it actually stopped my drinking. It’s been a year and a half of no drinking.  I drank twice in the first 6 months because i was hanging out with friends from out of town who I used to drink heavily with.  Neither time did I get really drunk (which previously was a guarantee) and when I woke up in the morning i knew i was better off without it.  It’s now been over a year since Ive had any alcohol!  The greatest part is the freedom to no longer have to devote any brain space to alcohol.  I’m truly free!

he use to call me Minty Moo Mouse. I had forgotten that, because as he got drunker, he stopped saying the funny, smart witty things that made him him......

he was an alcoholic, of long standing, 750 mls of vodka a day. He was bright yellow when he died. He could not speak, he was just reduced to grunting, I don’t know why that was.

I do know he hid it well. Until I came along, at the end, and he could no longer hide it.

he was an alcoholic, but he was a father of two, a younger brother, an ex husband of one, an ex boyfriend of many, a friend of long-standing to his childhood mates.

born in New Zealander, died in Australia, he lived a life few of us would dream of, he made an income that even fewer will experience. He lived in South Africa, the Middle East and the Phillipines. He partied hard and had some amazing adventures.

he was smart, a lovely singer, a poet, a writer, a rugby player......he could wax lyrical about movies, poetry, life. He was funny, an amazing story teller, an entertainer.

he could also be mean, petty, cruel, selfish and ungrateful...he said some horrible things to those that were close to him.

despite a lifetime of work, he died nearly penniless....

He died in hospital, rattling breathing, unable to eat, drink, talk or walk.

I take solace that he knew he was loved by many.....but I take no solace in his death.

I went to meetings with him, picked him up of the floor, got him into hospitals and rehab, packed his hospital bags, cleaned up his home, looked after his cat, yelled, cajoled, cried and flirted with him until I got him to try a new rehab facility....all to no avail....he died drunk....after a months long binge....

I am writing this, as my tribute to a funny, good looking, soft , gentle, smart man...who got lost in alcohol.

if you read this and you think for just one minute, that you don’t want this to be your end, that you don’t want a friend to write your obituary on a stop drinking page, now is the time to make the change.

I loved my friend Jeff...I know I did all I could to support him getting sober...but that could never happen, because in the end, his bravado, his glossing over his feelings, his pretence and story telling took precedence over him getting real, getting honest and showing up for himself. He could never really accept, we are human, we are flawed, we make mistakes, life is dirty, unpleasant, we have emotions....and he was no different to the rest of us.

Jeff, I told your story, because I love you.....and because others deserve to know that you were wonderful and you died because alcohol is a dangerous drug....

Rest In Peace Jeff...xxxx",176

My mother has been drinking since I was a child. She isn't drinking all the time, but when she does - she becomes erratic, violent, and doesn't seem to think clearly.

I am 28, I don't live with my mom and my step-dad anymore, and the last year or so I was certain things had calmed down over there. Yesterday, I received a phone call from my step-dad who said he wanted to let me know she's still drinking when she has time off work. When I was a child, it was like this vicious circle - she would drink, then scream and either hit me or throw things around the house, throwing a tantrum. Then she cried because she was sorry. This has been going on for years, except now I don't have to experience it in my own home. At some point she was using pills too, and once (that I know of) she tried to kill herself by going into the woods, trying to use a belt to hang herself. 

My step-dad said he can't handle being in a relationship with her if this continues, they have been together for almost 20 years and she's still drinking. He wanted help from me, so we can try to help her.

How do you help someone that doesn't want help? She already knows we hate that she drinks, because she's like a different person when she does. Any advice in this situation would be highly appreciated.",3

Im 35 now, I was drinking heavily for 10 years or so, I got the bright idea to quit on my own and ended up in the hospital after having an epileptic seizure.

I've been sober for 2 years now up until this saturday when I for some reason thought it would be a good idea to drink again. Half a 75cl bottle of whiskey, and then the same thing again on sunday. 

Come monday I went back at it again after holding out for a couple of hours and working all day, half a bottle down the hatch and pretty much the same on tuesday.

Now I'm sitting here with crippling anxiety and think I'm gonna die, I dont have any shakes or cramps just yet. But what would any of you guys do? Would you seek professional help at a hospital after this kind of drinking or just ride it out on your own? Try drinking less and less for a time?

I think what got me into this has been the long winter and the fact that I'm working from home. Maybe leaving my apartment one or two times a week for grocery shopping for about 2.5 months, this isolation and staying inside hit me harder than I thought it would and now that the snow is melting I really wanna get back out and skateboard again (A habit I picked up when I got sober)

I’m in an abusive ass relationship and have no familial financial support. I get by through trading stocks and receive no government funds although I’m unemployed.

Every day is a nightmare and I have awful dreams every night because alcohol interferes with my normal sleep patterns.

I blame my parents, I blame being raised in a rich area in Florida, I blame my trauma and past. But at the end of the day, my lack of success and happiness is totally my own fault and I can’t cope. So I drink and smoke/shoot dope. 

I’m begging!

If anyone has a suggestion that will help, pls drop it in the comments. I’m smart enough to keep myself drunk and high and under a roof, but I need help. Someone please tell me what to do. I’m miserable as fuck and I want to be better.

I used to never drink randomly during the week but recently have started drinking a beer or two a day because I just feel so much better when I am buzzed.

I have adhd and currently don’t work because I was medically retired from the military for depression/ptsd, so energy and motivation have always been my worst enemy. 

I play video games and stream at night and would drink a beer occasionally cus it helped loosened me up but over time it also made me realize how much better I felt having a buzz.

I’m really desperate for answers and don’t know how to go about helping my friend, let’s just call him Noah. Him and I are both Marine Corps veterans who left the service this last year. I’ve known him my whole tour and after leaving the Marines Noah, another close friend of ours, and I got an apartment together as brand new civilians. He never drank at all when we were active duty, frankly he despised it and found no enjoyment in consuming alcohol. Even when he would have a couple drinks he’d force himself to throw it up because he didn’t like the feeling. 

Towards the end of his service he started dating a female marine who was heavy on drinking, and I’m talking about 9 A.M. she’s cracking open beers or making a drink and continues throughout the day. When their relationship began is about when his interest in alcohol began and gets worse from there. 

He left the marines in August and he moved to our apartment alone since he left first. He drank to cope with the loneliness, then his girlfriend left for deployment in October only 2 months after they started dating, so he started to drink to cope with that as well. I feel like she set him on this path because the booze reminds him of her. 

Fast forward to December I get out and am living with him, he’s only drinking beer every other night at this point. Then on to January our other roomate gets here and he starts drinking less, until his girlfriend tells him on the phone that she doesn’t want to move in together immediately when she gets back like he was planning on. Since then (about mid January) until now he’s been drinking 1 third of a handle of Vodka a night. He gets loud and screams at things and video games and our other roomate. He’s aggressive to our other roomate, it’s playful it but way over the top like he’s trying to hurt him. He’s not aggressive towards me, but I’m still on edge every night.

I know i should try and talk to him when he’s sober, but every day when I’m home from work (5:00 P.M.) he’s already drunk and I think he starts drinking at 11. He told us last night he’s quitting school because he “lost interest”. I’m afraid he’s suicidal as well and what he’d do to himself or us. I want to help him more than anything right now but I don’t know how and I’m scared to bring it up to him because of his violence.

i’ve been to treatment (once inpatient, twice iop) for addiction several times in the last few years, all self admitted because i was worried i had a problem and felt i could not stop myself from drinking or smoking (weed). i always went in because i truly felt i needed help but every single time, i’d question whether i really needed this or was really an alcoholic and would give up or relapse in the next few days. my dad is an alcoholic and caused a lot of childhood trauma, i had an ex who was in AA and could never stay sober, and “becoming an addict” has been one of my biggest fears since i can remember. every time i would think “you just came here because you’re *scared* you have this problem” (i’m also a major hypochondriac)

i am certain i have some addictive tendencies—but i can stop drinking. i can even stop smoking but then it becomes eating, or sex, or a new love interest, or anything else that i can use as a crutch or escape. so i’ve never really thought alcoholism was my problem, it’s just *me*. 

however, lately my drinking has been a lot more regular and i’ve become a lot more dependent on it. it’s also affecting my relationship which i’m really concerned about—i’ve been trapped at home (i live with my SO) for about two weeks due to the winter storm in my area, and really the only thing that’s gotten me out of bed some days is the bottle in the other room. ive been drinking daily and i’ve noticed it’s very hard to go more than a day without drinking. a few days were really bad and i just would drink until i felt sleepy, go to bed, wake back up and do it all over again. one night i drank entirely too much, got extremely emotional andcouldn’t stop crying, and pretty much had a complete meltdown and self harmed (which i haven’t done in years), all in mine and my boyfriend’s shared apartment. i’m in a very very dark place and want help, but is addiction really the issue or do i just have substance abuse issues? are they the same thing? 

tl;dr what’s wrong with me",7

We drink too much, but I’ve been pushing it to lessen my drinking. I’ve had withdrawals and relapse the last couple weeks, but the last two days, I barely had two sips of beer and I feel fine.

My boyfriend on the other hand has been having a hard time slowing down. Yes, I’ve seen him have the shakes, tingles, sweats, nausea, and vomiting.. but tonight, he became kind of violent and not in his mind. He kept saying weird things like he was hearing or seeing stuff..

... Side context: when I was worse on alcohol, when I was quitting cold Turkey, I would hear stuff and have severe sweating.

... but tonight, he was being delusional, getting irritated. He’d call me a bitch, but then reversed back to a nicer mood and say he didn’t say that to me then call me “babe”. Then he kept slurring and saying weird stuff he’s seen.. then out of nowhere, he kinda to start get violent and push me around and throw stuff. I was doing the same while crying, so I finally said fuck it and grab my stuff and left him to his dad. 

I don’t know what to do. Was I right to do that? I have encouraged him to slow down on drinking so we can get sober but I don’t know if he did it too fast. This whole night has been weird. I’m worried but still mad and sad at the same time.

Sorry for the rant. I’m not seeking medical advice. I just feel at a split moment in my life right now.",9

I enjoy the relaxation and thinking space alcohol provides me, although im physically imposing, useful round the rough parts I live in, but Ive sadly found that alcohol allows me to bring out my best self in life. In 12 years of drinking, its almost like it allows me to function as I ordinarily  should function. Sober, im spaced out, depersonalised, OCD, trapped in anxiety and lethargy, really withdrawnnn in life, with a small circle of friends. 

I was born 3 months prematurely, and was a difficult child, with clear hyperactivity problems, though with strict disciplinarian parenting metted out by my father, I mellowed out overtime into a withdrawnnn, unconfident, overly mellow, adult. 

Alcohol has served me very well, ive never been aggressive or provocative, it allows my personality to shine uninhibited, gentle, charismatic, creative, I mostly drink 3 to 4 cans daily 9% high strength lager or a 35cl bottle of vodka rarely overstepping due to wanting to minimise hangover effects the following day. Its been over a decade long pattern of drinking this way a minimum a couple times a week, to since losing my job last month, a daily streak. Alcohol has allowed me to hang in a clear introspective space, to allow me to piece my thoughts together and formulate plans of action, invigorate me and inspire me to take charge of my life and write endless diaries and action plans which has been truthfully a decent aid to my life. Though I recognise the inevitable physical dangers.

Sober..I am a space head, lethargic, numb, spacious as though life just passes me by, I am intelligent and very socially perceptive, but very withdrawn and inert, and find it difficult to express my thoughts. I have just enough small drive, to work long hours as a security guard, whilst clamping down enough concentration to pass a few accounting exams, and maintain a workout routine. But I am otherwise very idle, with no real  voice. Very lethargic and scatter brained, can anyone relate to this particular type of alcoholism? Whereby its not so overtly destructive, but serves as a subtle band aid to feeling, thinking, cognizing functions.

I went to school in the same grade and class as the guy. We graduated together and I left that shitty town and so did he. We never kept in contact but when we finally met up, it was like a family reunion. I loved the guy. He was always bright and cheerful. Last time I saw him was when my father passed away. We hung out at a bar and had a couple pitchers of beer. Even then he had nothing but good news to share and being like a brother, he cheered me up when I was going through a lot after losing my father:

Last summer, I heard he was having seizures and such because of his alcohol consumption. He was taking it easy on pounding them back he said. 

This morning, my brother got a call to start contacting his family because, the apartment concierge found he had passed. Apparently he had been drinking all week and even missed his flight to work last week. The police said that they don’t suspect foul play or suicide and that he seemed to have had a seizure. 

This guy was a fun guy to just be around.

**edit**

Not looking for sympathy, but I wouldn’t mind it, either. Just spreading awareness to what happens to some good people when it comes to alcohol. This can be anybody you know of, or even you. I can be you or that somebody you know that dies from it. 

A loss from alcohol can come so sudden and quite a shock to those who are left behind. Get help while you or your friend (which ever that has a problem) are still around.",18

.I've accumulated a bunch of debt 

.I work in food retail In the UK over the covid19 outbreak

. I suffer from anxiety, and my relationship with my girlfriend on some days is hit or miss

. I've started to develop an addiction to porn, I feel like I'm chasing the rabbit for the excitement and even going to places I shouldn't do for the rush.

I need help because when I do have that one or two weeks away from alcohol everything becomes better, I lose a ton of fat and my mind is cleared. But theres always that monkey on my shoulder telling me after my shift to have just one.

I can't just have one by the way, i always have to drink enough to reach that Goldilock zone. I used to get to that through 4 cans, now it takes me one strong cider+4 pint cans a night to do that.

Addiction is a very funny beast though. Like when I have a grasp on things it just takes over and fucks up my day as I’m sure it does with most of us. So I used to enjoy bbq’ing for hours... it’s was an excuse to drink for hours by myself in the backyard. Fun right? Well me hiding my true addiction I fronted that I absolutely enjoyed BBQ’ing like I was the next world champ of it. Lol nope I actually disliked it, it was just an excuse to get fucked up and I did it sometimes twice a week.

Well come now, I’m sober, in a new place with my girlfriend. I’ve been pretty much straight up with her about my addictions besides some of the super low parts because she is as straight edge as they come and I don’t think she would understand a lot of my dirty gritty booze filled gutter nights. Being at this new place help me cut out so many things that contributed to my drinking.... for example bbq’ing. Today,  I wake up to a gift from the girlfriend. A brand new expensive shiny grill in the backyard and her looking mighty proud of herself... which she should be. But this fucking dirty ass addiction came up in my head and I thought “oh fuck, she doesn’t know... I have no interest in bbq’ing with out booze... IT WAS ALL BULLSHIT!”

So I act as pleasantly excited as I can. I’m straight up faking it... it feels almost as if I’m continuing my sneak drinking from my past trying to act sober. I in no way can tell her what I feel. She wanted me to have something that she truly thinks I’ve been missing from my life and she went above and beyond to make that happen. I just never thought to tell her it was all bullshit and now how do I do that. But no here I am just questioning this shit and trying to figuring out how I’m going to fake that I actually like this without a voice in my head screaming how much better it would be with a beer... you know mental torture.

Like fuck, as sober as I am and continue to be I wish these little mental games in my head would shut the fuck up sometimes and just enjoy things like this. But I can’t...",5

Anyway, I’m trying to find a good alcohol substitute to help trick my brain while I’m tapering down. The issue is, regarding cravings, I found that for me one of the big things is the bite that alcohol has. I know a lot of people purposely avoid it but my preferred drink has always been drinking hard liquor straight without mixing because I specifically enjoy that volatile/ethereal, “fuel” kind of feeling. 

I’m not sure if it would be possible to get such a feeling without the alcohol itself? I certainly wouldn’t know how to do it. But I was just wondering if anyone knew of any alcohol-free products that had that same sort of feeling to them?

(sidenote, this is my first serious time trying to stop drinking, so I’m a bit new, are alternatives actually useful for tapering down in your experience? Or should I just stick through it)

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! Will definitely give these a try. I wish there existed volatile fluids that weren’t alcohol that were drinkable.",2

I am deciding to take control before it ruins my life. This is the first time I’ve been on the sub.,"What can I say here. I’m getting real emotional even trying to type this shit out. It’s fucking evil man. It has taken me down a really dark path in life. It has completely tarnished my image in society. It has destroyed close relationships of mine. It has made me the laughing stock of the family. It has made me into a criminal. It has destroyed my mind and body. It has turned me into a completely different person. I don’t know who i even am anymore.

I’m only 24 but the past few years have a been a real rollercoaster. I transferred into a university after community college. I specifically picked a party school because I wanted to get in on the action. I hadn’t yet realized I had an alcohol problem because I didn’t party in high school. I hadn’t realized I was transferring into hell. 

The culture just reeks of alcoholism here. The frats and sororities are at the top of the pecking order so your seen as cool for being in one. I had thought that same thing so I had tried relentlessly to get in a frat. But they’re an evil place. Almost all frats here haze and that emotional abuse just leads to more and more drinking. And they’re rewarded with hot girls who do the same thing.

But I realized it was a blessing in disguise for me. I would’ve probably hurt myself or did something pretty awful if I had been in one. It wasn’t for me I was raised to be religious and I got evil vibes from all of them. Maybe I’m wrong I’m not trying to bash anyone in them. But this culture brainwashed me into thinking that I had to be in one. It made me think alcoholism was a funny topic rather than a serious issue. Behind the curtains I’d bet a lot of those kids have issues. It’s not all it’s cracked up to just be abused. 

My addiction has gotten me arrested on a few occasions. I’m currently dealing with an assault charge and I’m really scared. This is the third time in the past year that I’ve been charged with something. It has ruined my image because anyone can search up my mugshot. My family is embarrassed but also worried for me. That’s just not who I am. I know alcohol is supposed to represent sober thoughts. But some of the things I did on this shit, I’d never do. 

The whole time I didn’t even care, I’d continue to drink and wake up to hear I did something bad while drunk. Every single fucking Sunday I would just hide in bed because I’d be worried of what I did or said while drunk. I’d say random shit to girls or guys on social media, then feel like shit the next day. I just can’t believe the image I was putting out there to people. They must think I have a lot of issues. It got me into a fight where I got knocked out hard because I couldn’t even balance. Then arrested after so my mugshot has a black eye. It’s all just really embarrassing, I’m scared to even show my face in public sometimes. 

I don’t want this for myself anymore. I have to stop here and draw the line or else I will end up in jail or dead. I heard 50% of murders are committed while drunk and that scared the shit out of me. What is this stuff doing to people! It’s making them into killers, maybe they already were but still scary. I’m so worried that something bad like that could happen to me that it’s not even worth the risk anymore. I need to get clean. 

The worst is not even remembering shit the next day. I would hear from my friends how I embarrassed myself again. Or I’d get confused messages from girls that I said some shit to. It’s just not fun anymore. It’s not fun waking up the next day and everything is shit. It’s not fun losing my fucking wallet or phone or keys because I’m such an idiot while drunk. Then having to go through Gods earth trying to find it. But it’s hard to find things when you can’t remember shit. 

I feel like I’m missing out on creating memories with my friends because I don’t remember anything. I’d hear stories about how I kissed a girl or said something funny, but if I don’t remember it then it’s not even worth it. This whole addiction is just pure fucking lunacy. All these college kids are a bunch of lunatics and i can’t wait to graduate. I’m just scared that I’ve started beef with people now with all the shit I said. And the worst part is I don’t know who I would even be talking to. 

I was raised religious but I stopped caring at a young age. I felt like my life was shit and God was to blame. I couldn’t accept responsibility for my own actions. I was a complete moron and it sucks that I’m just now realizing all this shit. But I’m going to try praying to God more and establish that relationship. Because my life has been turned into Hell. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I stopped believing in him around the time this shit started. As Wutang said “you don’t believe in heaven cause your living in hell”. That quote hit me hard because I realized I was living in hell and that took me away from God. I played into the devils plan, but I’m going to get out of this death contract. 

I feel like the devil is in me sometimes when I drink. I hear that’s why they call them spirits, because they’re evil. And I saw a comment, saying I don’t even remember liking this shit. It’s true I honestly hate alcohol now. I hate the way it makes me feel after. It’s like it drains the life force out of you. It attracts negativity and dangerous situations. It makes you vulnerable to getting beaten up. God didn’t want that for me. And that’s why he didn’t want me in a frat. Despite hating him for my life, he saved me.

Hell I don’t even want that for me. Ive smoked weed since 15 and it never took me down this bad of a path. I’ve noticed a huge decline in my life since picking up the alcohol habit. I need to take care of myself. I need to introduce self love into my life now. Because putting myself through this shit over and over again is the complete fucking opposite of self love. It’s killing me slowly and I’m going to try and quit now before it gets to late. I’m finally starting to feel ashamed for everything that I’ve done and I need to better myself.

Because when I drink one beer, it always leads to more. Especially in social settings around women. But it’s not for me, it brings out the worst part of my personality. I need to be the guy slamming back waters instead of booze. My grandfather even died of liver cancer and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that my mother also struggles with it too. It’s a sign for me that alcohol isn’t good. I can’t risk doing anymore damage to my life. It makes me sad that I couldn’t be confident enough to be myself without alcohol. 

So here goes to DAY ONE. I may start posting daily just to help me stay committed to my decision. Because once this hangover goes away, I know I’ll be tempted to get back on the wagon again. I know that my mind will play games and convince me that drinking isn’t bad. Moderation they say. But I finally accepted that I can’t control this demon. It has me in a death grip and I just need to cut my losses. 

The hardest part will be staying strong in the midst of a party college. My friends even laugh when I said I’m going to quit because they know I’ve said that before. They know it’s such an ingrained part of this college, but hopefully I can inspire them to also quit drinking. It’s all a huge lie that you NEED alcohol to have fun or be confident. I feel like I’m 10x more confident when sober because I don’t say retarded ass shit. 

Anyways if you read this far then thanks for taking the time. I’m scared for myself because I know i can’t control it. But hopefully I can stay strong and continue to stay sober. I will read more posts on the sub to help me. It’s like a sign from God that I need to quit. I’ve been getting Youtube recommendations to quit drinking and it’s really the only way out of this mess.",4

I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow and was looking for advice. I’ve been drinking 6-18 beers a night for the past 3-4 months. Lately much closer to 18. I’ve tried tapering but always fail and just get drunk. If I delay my start of drinking too long or don’t drink enough I get super bad anxiety and feel like I’m having a heart attack or dying, once I up my intake and get drunk enough I feel normal. I am starting to have these same symptoms when I wake up in the morning. I have no idea how to go about asking my doctor for medical help so I can just stop drinking and have some help with the withdrawals. I can’t really go to a detox as I am caretaker of my elderly mother who is recovering from her own recent hospital visit and have obligations at work, so I really need some advice on how to have this conversation with my doctor and get threw detoxing at home.",2

Five months which I'm quite dedicated to continuing. The thing is, I just never really bought into the program. I'm very happy for those that the program works for; I'm happy they find some purpose in it. But, for me, going to a meeting every day was akin to some mild form of torture. 

And I feel guilty I feel that way, but I had to be honest about it. I informed my sponsor that I felt I owed it to myself to search other avenues to help maintain my sobriety; and I've made therapy appointments and intend on going to SmartRecovery meetings. But I just am totally gripped by this guilt that I've let people down, and by being true to myself. He believes I'm headed straight back to a drink, which sort of makes me just feel utterly doomed. Not that I'm going straight for a drink, but just that he guaranteed it is in my near future (Do I feel that way? No, not really.)

The therapist I went made a triage to know what kind help I needed. That involved a bunch of questions mostly yes/no sometimes I had to give exemples.

She asked about sexual abuse. I said yes; by my older brother, I was 10, it happened at night three times that I can remember. Then she asked me to desbribe de abuse. 
I had talked about before once with a boyfriend but never in details, and I did for her until she realize my distraught and tell me to stop. 

That broke me somehow I left the clinic and got two beers with a xanax. 
After that I drank one other time also with xanax. Thinking about doing it again today.

I don't drink every night (or every day), and I don't over drink every time I do drink.  However, if I generalize, I'd say i drink 4 or 5 nights a week, and 2 or 3 of those nights I can't stop once I start.  I wake up with a massive hangover and can't function pretty much the whole day.  I tell myself I'm going to stop and this lasts a few days and then I start again.  I do seem to suffer modest withdrawals, but only to the extent that my sleep is shaky for 2 or 3 nights, then I'm okay.

I guess it's the not being able to stop once I start part that confuses and concerns me.  If I could stop at 2 or 3 drinks I'd be fine, and honestly you'd think that with the days I've lost to hangovers it would be simple.

I guess 1) I don't know how to define my problem so 2) I don't know what I need to do or who/where I should turn to.  Thank God for the internet :)

I've personally always been upfront and honest about my addictions. In all honesty i've never been ashamed of my addictions. In a sense i'm ashamed that i'm dumb for wasting my time.  It's date 1 maybe 2 getting to know me material. Look if your going to want to spend any amount of time about me your going to have to understand that in my past and even near present  I'm an alcoholic, heroin addict, and poly drug abuser.  I'm better then I used to be. Take it for what you will.

I love seeing the threads on Reddit of girls or guys asking if they should date a drug addict. My answer is always the same and it's the way I'd honestly look at me if I were a woman. If you don't have any history of drug abuse then things could be great, and you'll live happily ever after, but most drug addicts are that way probably from past trauma. People who grow up in chaotic environments crave chaos. You're going to end up with a lot of heart break trying to change something you can't.

You ever get into a really good relationship. Things are just going as perfect as can be. A little too perfect? So you decide to do something small. Maybe an offhand comment you know will cause a reaction? Because happiness isn't something that your used to?

That's addict behavior. So I tell them up front. This is who I was, this is who I am now, and this is what I hope to be one day. I am not a perfect human being but I do try and I do care about the people that I am close to. I can't honestly say whether you will regret ever meeting me. I'd certainly hope not. I can't think of anyone that i've dated that I regret spending that time with.

I personally just need to keep moving forward and recognizing the things that I do that are nothing more then myself trying to block my own path.

Some leave, some don't. Shrug. That isn't for me to decide, and I'm certainly not going to waste your time or mine. I grew up watching domestic abuse and so far it's something i've never done. I'd probably kill myself at that point to be honest. I failed at the one thing I hate the most. I've never cheated either. I'm incredibly loyal. I'm also not the super jealous or untrusting type. I'll never ask to go through your phone. I'm incredibly trusting of people which in the dope game has definitely lost me money but I believe the things that people tell me unless they give me reason to otherwise.

One of the things that I hate the absolute most about addiction is the straight up monetary cost. I've spent well over 100k on drugs easily. Addicts are seasoned liars. I've always worked for my money and everything I have and it's sad to see what I have to show for it. The thing that sucks most about that is I'm taking from us and what we could have.

At this point in life me personally I wouldn't date an addict unless they seriously had a control on that portion of there life. Im pretty good about turning drugs down and not just doing whatevers there but I've dated girls while we were both addicts and they will use your feelings against you to get drugs from you. My ex who got me into heroin in the first place on like my 22nd birthday I actually didn't feel like doing a bunch of drugs just wanted to kick back. Was just like ok then i'm leaving. Had me crying like i just wanted to spend time with you ok we'll go get drugs.

Now that I'm getting farther along in my own journey as an addict i've found that I definitely have a much easier time if they aren't into drugs at all. My last ex smoked a lot of pot but i'm not really into the stuff anymore so it was whatever. All though that's why i left her because all she wanted to do was smoke pot and play video games. No energy, no life, when we first met she casually smoked a J here and there. She was fun and interesting to be around. 5 years later she's got a blowtorch doing dabs all day every day and that's just her life.

I couldn't take it anymore so I left and i've been single since. Sorry it got a little long and rambling in places. If you take the time to read it I appreciate it. The stories tie into why I feel the way I do and add depth to my answer.",2

They are both in their early thirties and have three young girls, my goddaughters.

Since I haven't spoken directly with my sister-in-law since before divorce was on the table, I am looking for advice on how to be there for her without being overbearing. I want her to know that I love and support her and she can always reach out to me. I am 13 years younger than them both. She was my babysitter back in the day before they even started dating and I was the first to know when they did get together. I truly love, respect, and cherish this woman. Even as a little girl I would tell my parents that if my brother were to ever mess anything up, that I would still want to stay close with his girlfriend, who then became my sister-in-law.

I don't want to pry for anything she's not comfortable sharing but since I've only heard my brother's side of the story, I am also interested in hearing what's actually been going down and how serious she is about going through with getting a divorce or if the relationship could be mended if my brother changed. My brother is a 'functional' alcoholic but can get emotionally abusive when he drinks and then forgets about what he's said. She's opened up to me about this before. I want her to know that I support what's best for her and my three nieces who are also my goddaughters. My sister-in-law is one of the greatest people I've had the honor of knowing, and I do honestly believe she deserves better than what my brother has become but also think if he got help then that may change.

My brother is in a very dark place. They've been living apart for a few days now but it sounded like divorce was brought up a couple weeks ago. He's brought up suicide which absolutely terrifies me but is assuring that he wouldn't go through with it because he loves his daughters too much. I only found out anything was up last night. I believe my brother is struggling with depression and have been encouraging him to get professional help, especially knowing that alcohol just makes the cycle worse. He sees mental illness as a weakness, though, and is in denial that his words and actions have played any role at all in leading to a potential divorce. Perhaps if my brother can overcome his I'm-too-macho-for-therepy complex, then there's a chance they could mend things and he can return to the loving father and husband that she fell in love with. But idek if mending things is on the table in her mind or how serious she actually is about getting a divorce.

I know that addiction is a disease that physiologically alters the brain. Our dad's side of the family has a lot of alcoholism yet our dad doesn't drink and shames anyone who does. My brother is not yet ready to admit he is addicted but I don't think it's my place to tell him that he is. I do want to get the point across, though, that addiction is not shameful, it is a disease. People with alcoholism deserve shame free help just like people with any other disease. I just don't know how to go about bringing any of this up before he's ready to admit he's an alcoholic. I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to go about educating myself and being there for my brother.

TL,DR: I'm looking for advice on how to help my brother when he won't help himself and how to reach out to my sister-in-law so she knows that I love and support her always, even though she is considering divorce.",8

I've tried to get sober multiple times and finally I'm sober, stable, went to rehab, at an IOP, go to meetings, etc. I'm not worried about starting to drink again as I have a fellowship and solid tools.

The issue is now that I'm sober, it's become painfully clear that my wife is an alcoholic too.  She drinks between 3-4 bottles of wine per night, starts as early as 10:30am, is slurring her speech by 3pm, and passes out between 7-8pm, usually on the couch.  Both her 5 year son (my step-son) and her parents have come to me in their own way with concern. She starts fights every night, stumbles around the house after 7pm, crashes into things, falls down stairs, yells at her son for no reason to the point he becomes afraid of her after 5pm, the whole deal.  She's in total denial and blames me for her drinking, but doesn't see it as a problem because she never remembers the night before. I've asked her to stop drinking and now she completely resents me and tells me how unhappy she is (she gets really mean once she starts drinking).

I know from meetings, therapy, and my own personal experience that I can't talk someone into sobriety, and if I try, they'll resent me. Well, I tried, and she resents me.

I love her and leaving her is off the table, at least for now.  I'm far from perfect - when I was drinking I did stupid shit and stumbled around and passed out around the house too.  I have no idea what to do.

Edit: I'm on (and have been since I got sober) Antabuse, so I can't physically drink (I tried once on it and had an extremely severe reaction which scared the shit out of me - thought I was going to die)",61

2021-02-18 13:31:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lmtl9u/new_here_would_love_some_advice/,"New here, would love some advice","Hi guys, I’m new here. This is actually my first ever Reddit post and I’ve lot a lot by reading this subreddit before I signed up.

I’m a 24 m who’s been drinking moderately since about 18 but it never got bad until mid 2020 with COVID. I started to binge drink in the evening/night maybe twice a week, but very recently I started messing around with “hair of the dog” and drinking in the morning to stave off the hangovers. 

At first it was great, but then those days turned into full on drinking days benders as well and I think this started to cause some mild withdrawals with my brain not having enough time to rest in between drinking sessions. Right before New Years Eve I came off about a week bender with one abstinence day in the middle (3 days drinking, 1 day off, 3 days drinking) and felt terribly depressed, anxious, lost appetite for a couple days, and had trouble sleeping. Every time I’d fall asleep I’d jerk back awake as if I was falling.

I’ve done a lot of searching up on withdrawals and I’m still having trouble even figuring out if what I’ve experienced is just a bad, stretched hangover or mild withdrawals. I don’t get shakes or tremors unless you count the small jerks when I’m falling asleep. My BP is a little elevated but my heart rate is normal.

I’ve read a lot on HAMS about kindling and how repeated withdrawal cold turkey leads to it, so I’ve been wondering if I should be tapering off to avoid that stress on my brain. I can deal with the WD symptoms again, but if tapering can help me avoid kindling I’m all for it. After my NYE experience I quit for a month cold turkey but last weekend I drank moderately Friday and Saturday night, and heavily starting Sunday night constantly through Tuesday (maybe 12-15 drinks a day). I’m wondering if I should start tapering today to ease the symptoms this time around? (if it’s even withdrawal at all). I’m prescribed some xanax I could use so I don’t just start another bender by trying to taper with alcohol. I really want to avoid kindling damage and I’m wondering if 36 hours after my last drink is too late and I’ve already reached the cold turkey point. I feel better than yesterday but still shitty, same symptoms as last time. I should add I took .5 mg Xanax the last night of my bender hoping it would curb my alcohol cravings. It didn’t, and could be contributing to how shitty I’ve felt since yesterday with the whole GABA and mixing thing. I’ve been thinking maybe the symptoms started after the Xanax wore off rather than after my last drink, because they set in later than usual. Any advice on anything I said is greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post. 

TL;DR
Does anyone have any experience with tapering to avoid withdrawals/kindling? And is 36 hours since the last drink too late to start an effective taper, if I have withdrawals at all?",2

She has severe asthma and a weakened immune system, recently she's come down with what the hospital thinks is a bacterial infection and she's been put on antibiotics, she has to take six pills every morning and I've just seen her and she's drunk. I didn't see her with alcohol so she either snuck it up to her room or she has some already up there.

She's deep in denial and won't hear that she has any kind of problem, it got so bad last year I moved out. She begged me to come back, insisting she'd changed and would seek professional help but she hasn't at all. The only change she's made is she has been less verbally abusive, but she's spending more time in her room which I think is the only way she can avoid being verbally abusive.

Her drinking makes her asthma worse, something she has acknowledged, and she injures herself a lot when she's drunk. This all causes her to ""feel sick"" and keep missing work, which now means she's on a disciplinary and will probably lose her job.

I'm at the end of my rope. The whole family know, because I told them all last year, but most are reluctant to ""get involved"", and the others just take her word for it that things are better or tell me she's too stubborn and its a waste of time. I want her to get help and to stop killing herself AND pushing us all away. I don't know what to do, I spend so much energy worrying about and cleaning up after her, I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted due to acting like her parent for the last six years.

He has his own kids and I have mine. We live separately but I live with him when our kids are at the other parents houses. I’m female 41 and he is 46. I didn’t know he had a problem at first, he said he started feeling really “good” with me so that’s why he reverted back to drinking. (?? Seems like an odd thing to say) Anyway, he gained 50 pounds. Hardly eats much so I know it’s all booze. Drank 6-10 drinks every day for 2 years. Never appeared drunk since he’s so used to drinking. Finally a month ago after 2 years of me begging, pleading, drinking myself to deal, me stopping drinking, him promising to change and me saying “it’s over I’m done” - he went on naltrexone. He said it worked for him before I met him. So he was an alcoholic before I met him and I had no idea until more into our relationship. This week he drank 6-7 drinks Friday night because it’s “Friday”.  He had three drinks Saturday night as I was sick in bed and he said “I was having a great time watching a movie, and I wanted drinks! What’s wrong with that?”  Then Sunday he had two drinks. Tonight he poured a strongbow saying he’s going through stress, and he painted a room that day so he wants a drink. He wants a drink when he’s stressed. He wants a drink when he’s happy. He wants a drink when he exercises. He wants a drink when he is done work. He wants a drink after he mows the lawn. Tonight I flipped out. I told him two days ago that I am very anxious that he’s having drinks. I flipped out because two days ago he knew how anxious I was and still poured a drink today. He said I’m being totally unreasonable and unloving and have not given him enough time to prove that he’s trying.  Drinking 4 days a week (so far) is not trying to me. He said that yes he drank only 2 drinks in 3/4 days and I should happy with how far he has come from the 6-10 a day he used to have up to a month ago. He decided to tell me that he accepts that I have anxiety and because of that I should accept that he has a life long battle. He said I should accept that he will most likely fight alcoholism (he doesn’t use that word) his entire life and he will never give up alcohol ever but he will take that drug Neltrexone every time he has a craving for the rest of his life. (And he will still drink after taking it but it will be less) I told him that him relying on a pill for the rest of his life is not reassurance for me. He lost his job a while ago and said he would go to counselling if he had benefits but he cant go without benefits. The thing is I begged him to go two years ago to see a counsellor and he said no he doesn’t believe in counsellors. He always has answers. And tonight he made me feel like a horrible person for not seeing he’s trying.  This has been an ongoing exhausting battle for years.   I went back to my own house for the night as we just kept going around and around in circles. Am I a bad person? I am divorced. You only live once. Do I really have to resign to the fact that I need to deal with an alcoholic the rest of my life so im not a bad person?  He says I haven’t even let him show me he’s trying. Yes he’s cut back huge but he’s still drinking. How do I know he won’t slip up in 4 years ?  Also isn’t taking that pill for life damaging health wise too so I’ve read?

I wanted to stop about halfway though but I couldn’t get myself to, i would drink even when I didn’t want to that night and end up finishing half a bottle of Tito’s, and it got to the point with my tolerance where I could and would down a whole fifth in a couple hours, and I’m like 5’9 120lbs. I just always wanted to fkn drink, and I always came up with excuses as to why it was okay for me to drink that night, even tho the real reason was that I was bored, lonely, and didn’t want deal with the flood of overwhelming emotions I was feeling just in general and alcohol became my third crutch, along with smoking everyday and vaping. Both my moms parents were alcoholics and my mom has been drinking basically since i was born, I could see myself walking that same path, except I was full on sprinting into the abyss. It was my best friend in the world who really talked to me about my drinking in October which got me to take it really seriously and then a mushroom trip for the new year which really cemented it and I can honestly say I don’t wanna drink anymore. I’ve been drunk maybe 8 times this year and the only time I drank by myself was for my birthday and it was because my family tested for Corona and I couldn’t leave my house, the rest have been on a Friday or Saturday night with my friends where I’ve drank a moderate amounts, shit I’ve gone though about a bottle when i already had like 12 sitting on my desk by this point last year. Idk really what my point in all this is and it’s kinda a disconnected story, I just wanna convey how just appreciative I am that I was able to get out of this, someone here said awhile ago when I posted about my drinking they they wish they had the self awareness i had when they were 21 and they were 25 at that point, I m just grateful for it tbh and I’m glad I was able to get myself out of a hole, with the help of mushrooms and the full intention to get out of it and not fall into the footsteps of my mom and grandparents. I guess the point is, facing myself wholly, mushrooms, intentions to better myself, oh and hobbies I’ve been making a lot more are and music now, really helped me. Idk at this point I’m rambling and idk if I even meet the criteria for an alcoholic but my drinking was really out of control and I’m not drunk now and don’t wanna be, so cheers to that

I can't stop thinking ""I'm not even an alcoholic, I just have a toxic habit with alcohol"" but I'm scared I really am an addict. It scares me because alcoholism of my family members ruined my childhood and I always thought ""I will NEVER become that."" Now it seems like I kind of am. It feels out of my control and I'm scared",61

My boyfriend is also sober (3 1/2 years) and we do our best to stay sober and happy. Our family and friends are supportive and we appreciate that. 
My siblings,  while supporting and kind, don't realize how much it sucks for me that they party and stay late and post all their pictures on FB. My nephew's birthday party was yesterday, he turned 7. While my boyfriend and I left pretty early because we had to take my oldest to his dad's, for some reason I didn't expect the party to go for too much longer because my siblings have very young kids as well. As we layer down in bed for the night, perusing FB for a bit, we both scroll past several partying pictures of my siblings. I instantly felt regret and sadness. I actually said that sobriety sucks as I rolled over to attempt sleep. 
I know being sober is my decision,  and based on my life before, it's absolutely the right decision and I'm not sure I would even be alive if I wasn't.  I feel so left out from my siblings and it crushes me. We don't want to be around a bunch of drunk people,  but at the same time, I can have fun without drinking and would love to be more included. I don't know how to approach this, feel about this, go about or change anything, or even if I should. 
I really just hate feeling so left out. I hate how much I miss drinking and getting high. I hate that my family feels the need to leave me out simply because they want to get drunk and I can't. I hate that I let my life get out of control in the first place. I hate a lot of things.

It’s been on for him for a long while. 

We are both in our 30s.
Things got so bad in October 2020 that he had to leave his job here, under the pressure of me and his mom, he went to rehab in the US. He came back a month ago, all fresh..
But today i found out he is been smoking weed for a week already. 

It’s been terrible for me to live through this last year, because I also have a very stressful job in marketing, and the pressure can be high sometimes on me.

Also I have history with alcohol, not from me but when I was little I always had to bear my gran father who was alcoholic, then my gran mother was drinking consequently, and then came to my mom when I was older, trying to get her out of it. In my family they are agressive alcoholics, but my boyfriend is the sweetest and will never be mean to me. But due to the experiences I had with alcoholics I have a lot of trouble to contain my emotions, and it hurts me so bad that I cry really hard, and I know it does not help him. 
I need help; i dont know how to do to support him, and get in control of my emotions.

I'm hoping for a little insight and/or perspective from those who have been (or currently are) in a similar situation or mindset as him. I will try to be brief.

Two nights ago he raged at me (nothing physical), without provocation, regarding on-going issues within my family while he was heavily drinking. He woke the next morning repentant, stating (again) that he knows he needs to get his drinking under control and asking me not to hold this setback against him. He made good on his claim last night and didn't drink.

Tonight I went out for an errand before dinner and received a call that my mother had passed away (expected, but painful news nonetheless). When I got home I realized he'd started drinking while I was out. He'd only had one (possibly two) at the time, so I let it be. I didn't want to start a fight. I just wanted to feel loved and supported.

To his credit, I did notice that he stopped drinking earlier than he typically would have and before going to bed he gave me physical attention for comfort and let me just cry to him for a bit. He even came back out to the couch again for a good while when he heard me start sniffling after he left. However, I can't help but feel as though he wasn't *as attentive* or *as comforting and reassuring* as he could have been fully sober.

Is it reasonable for me to be bothered or upset that he's already drinking again? Or that he didn't stop as soon as he heard the news of my mother's death so he could be (closer to) fully sober to comfort me tonight?

Or should I focus on the positives - that he stopped drinking before completely over-indulging (comparatively), that he was willing to offer me any comfort, and that he didn't jump back on a rant regarding the issues he'd been so upset about just two nights previously?

I will add that we've experienced some extreme stressors on our marriage over the past year and are trying to reconcile and strengthen our relationship, but have definitely been struggling and his drinking habits are part of the reason(s). I really want to acknowledge and praise any good habits or changes to encourage him to pursue sobriety, but I honestly reached a point of ""no more chances"" after the last drunken outburst. I don't want this to be the hill our marriage dies on if I'm simply expecting too much of him too soon, though.",2

He only drinks beer.

He is a good father and husband and thoughtful and helps around the house. When our daughter was born he stopped drinking most nights and maybe had a few cans on a weekend. 

However he is currently drinking 9-10 cans of beer every night. More on a weekend.

Previously when he worked in the office he wouldn’t drink Monday thru Thursday. Now he’s working at home he has slipped into every night. There’s always a reason; the cricket is on, he’s in a good mood, he’s in a bad mood. Even when he was working from the office he would manage to get up and go to work at 8am if he’d had a drink.

I don’t drink alcohol I never have. I know this is a lot to be drinking weekly as the recommended amount of units is much lower. He has a problem right? I’ve tried to talk to him but his attitude is “it’s just beer”, “I don’t drink on a morning”.

But yesterday he started drinking at 4pm as he finished work early and later we needed something from the store but obviously he was too drunk to drive. It’s a good job I don’t drink as I often have to drive because he’s had a drink.

I haven’t been drinking for too long. I’ve never been much of a drinker but I experimented with it a little late 2020. It went super well every time. It kind of turns into the generic story it was once a week, then every other day, then a little every day. I haven’t been drinking daily since I’d assume New Years 2021, which was also my girlfriends birthday. 

Well, lately it’s become twice a day, and I’m realizing I need out before it’s too late. I am very strong willed and I know I can do this on my own, and would like to try (safety) before I consider medical attention. Since it’s only been a month or two, would it be safe to cold turkey it? I definitely have the self discipline to taper, but would like to as quickly as safely possible. Since New Years where it started at probably 6 units a day I’ve worked my way up to 2 sessions a day at 6 to 8 units at a time, at most 16 units in a day, some days as little as 10-12. I don’t seem to ever get any “sweats” or “shakes” but I’m afraid to test that.

I have many other questions, is it generally safe to wait til you start to feel withdrawals before taking your next dose? Once you feel shakes is it too late? Can I safely taper each dose before ever getting to the shakes?

Also, how much of a taper is too severe? I was thinking 2 drinks a day, continuing my two sessions a day routine until I’m down to 2-4 units and maintaining there for a few days just to make sure everything’s ok before I cut it off completely. Any issues with this plan? Should I stick to 1 unit less a day?

ANY advice would be amazing, if you think you have any input on any of these probably generic questions that I’m sure get asked a ton. Thank you all!",2

I took two weeks off from drinking and my testosterone haven't change much but I know that's not much time .  I don't want to break any rules here so I am not asking for medical advice.

But -

Alcoholism runs through both strands of my family like - well, like a disease. My dad died in his early sixties, by which time he had vascular dementia (cannot prove it was caused by drinking but I suspect it was). My mum drinks every night and has done for as long as I can remember. One of my siblings has been through AA (successfully) and one is a problem drinker, though not as much as me. My third sibling seems able to drink in a 'normal' way, as far as I am aware.

Do many people here have a family history of heavy drinking and do you feel that there is a genetic component?

I am sure I have a drinking problem, but I’m not sure if I’m an alcoholic. I’ve done the online tests and they say I’m not an alcoholic. 

I think part of this boils down to a couple major factors:

1) if I really want to I can and have stopped in the past

2) my drinking is very habitual. It doesn’t feel like a need it’s more like how I do a pocket tap to make sure my wallet is still there. I don’t do it because I feel the urge, I just do it because that’s what I do now. 

3) I have pretty much never gotten hangovers or after effects, so that skews results. 

4) some issues (like acid reflux) are issues I had before I ever drank at all. So they don’t really apply. 

Maybe these are alcoholic justifications. I know I need to fix my life in a lot of ways, and cutting back is just one. 

Am I an alcoholic in denial? Or is a problem with drinking always alcoholism? Or is there something else?",2

Truly, sober living is the best but it can really be hard to see how good it really can get while your still inside of drinking. It takes time after finally putting the sauce down. 

One thing I have noticed about myself is how increasingly neurotic I have become as I stay on the course. I have intrusive, ambiguous, flash back type thoughts that flood into my head almost everyday out of nowhere and I get that same old acute anxiety I used to get after being black out drunk. I start worrying about all the stuff I might have said and done 4, 10, 15 years ago. Sometimes I imagine narratives of what I must have been up to back when I was drinking myself into oblivion and I shudder at the thoughts, I cringe, I feel shame, envy, guilt, anguish...I'm not sure how to shake these thoughts, these feelings off.  I'm well past being interested in alcohol, I just want to figure out a way to shake off these daily downers now that I'm sober and have been for a good while.

We stopped talking for a few years (I moved out of the state) but still messaged each other happy birthdays. Recently she tried to reconnect with me. She’s in her 20s now. We called, and she was extremely drunk. I made an excuse to leave the call, because I can’t emotionally handle certain types of people when they’re not sober (probably due to my childhood trauma). She texted me confessing that she’s become an alcoholic and that she’s trying to get better, going to AA meetings and stuff. I told her we can call the next day to catch up once she’s sober.

The next day I called her almost right after she got out of work and she was already drunk again, but like, delirious. She showed me her same cat five times because within the span of minutes she forgot that she had already shown it to me. It scratched her face and she had blood running down her cheek and she was laughing but also crying because of something else, she looked insane, I started crying and hung up on her. This was a few weeks ago and neither of us have said anything to each other since.

It hurts so much to see someone who was so bouncy and happy and intelligent as a child succumb to this. I want to text her that I love her and I don’t blame her for anything she’s going through, but also let her know that I’m not in a stable enough place to have her in my
life until she’s at least a little better. Any tips on how I should word this? I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I want to set boundaries and make sure she knows I love her.

2021-02-10 13:06:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lgzmfx/over_a_week_sober_relapse/,Over a Week Sober + Relapse,"Hey y'all,

Two weeks ago I posted about quitting, and I received some truly tremendous advice. Just to recap, I'm a 22yo man living in my parents' house during the pandemic. I drank on and off throughout college, but only on weekends and only socially. In lockdown, I started routinely drinking alone because it helped calm my anxiety. Eventually I could feel it begin to take its tool on both my mental and physical health, and I knew something had to stop. 

I'm here to tell fellow newbie quitters that although things are looking up now, I DID briefly relapse. I made the stupid mistake of not telling my parents I was quitting (I didn't want them to be worried about me), and my Dad (bless his heart) picked up a six pack of my favorite beer on a grocery run. Just my luck, he NEVER does this! My Dad doesn't even drink, he was just trying to be nice. Three months ago, I would've appreciated this so much. But now, I felt doomed.

The thing that really sucked was that the second I saw it as I was unpacking bags, I knew I was going to drink it all. I didn't even have a shred of doubt, it was inevitable. At this point I was five days sober, the longest I had gone without drinking since at least April. My rationale was that since I hadn't experienced any physical or mental symptoms from quitting (I felt better than I had in months) I actually *wasn't* an alcoholic and therefore I could start drinking again.

Well, I was wrong. I was SUPER wrong. The second I drank the first beer, I knew I made a mistake. I didn't even like the feeling alcohol gave me anymore. Still, I drank two more. And these are 8% IPAs, so this was more like 4-5 beers. I made up an excuse to avoid dinner, that I was Zooming with a friend, so I could try and feel that familiar drunk feeling while I watched TV by myself. In hindsight, this was one of the saddest nights of my life. Just a total feeling of failure and defeat.

Then the next day, I did it again. I drank the remaining three beers within a 45-minute span. The previous night I hadn't felt that typical euphoric rush from getting drunk, and I figured that if I drank more quickly it would happen. Once again, dumb.

I couldn't make up another excuse for dinner, so I sat down with my family. Unsurprisingly, I was irritable and combative. Nothing hurtful, just taking issue with everything everyone said and generally being a brat. Somehow my family couldn't even tell that I was super drunk (I asked my sister later and she had no idea), they just thought I was being an asshole. Upon finishing a dinner, I realized I had subtly ruined it. Not in a flashy, aggressive way, but just by making any fun or supportive conversation impossible.

So I broke into tears. I told my family I had been trying to quit drinking, and I fucked it up. They completely understood every word. My Dad is a recovering alcoholic himself, so he was immediately supportive (and I think he felt terrible in hindsight about buying beers lmao). They all promised they would hold me accountable, and that they would do whatever they could to help me stop.

Well, it's now been nine more days and I haven't had a single drink. Not just that, but I haven't even *wanted* to. Clarification: those first five days, before I relapsed, were *rough*. I had a strong and intense craving for alcohol every single day. It took a ton of willpower to stop at a corner store without picking up beers. 

In other words, I think my relapse was actually the event that made it easier to quit. It showed me firsthand that no, going back in any capacity *isn't* a good idea. So I just wanted to say that if you're like me and you were trying to quit, but made a mistake and picked the habit up again, it is NOT over for you. Far from it. You absolutely can try to quit again, and it may even be easier this time.",5

I used to drink every few months with friends, but after seeing what it’s done to him, and how it hurts me to see him drink, I decided to quit in order to support him.

He’s had multiple seizures from trying to stop drinking over the years.  He’s been put in the hospital for being so out of his mind that he just didn’t know what he was doing or saying.  I’ve come home from work to blood all over the walls, bed, and towels to find he’d fallen and bashed his eye open.  In just the past year he’s had to have his window bust out from having a seizure while driving, and then totaled his car (on our street) by hitting a parked car.

I try to always make sure he doesn’t drive, but he leaves for work before I get home usually due to overtime.  I don’t buy alcohol for him. I refuse.  I’ve tried talking to him and I get told “I’m controlling him”, or that it’s just how he copes and I can never understand.

His mother has cried on my shoulder because she’s afraid it’s going to kill him. And so am I.  It drains me to see him like this. But what can I do?   He’s never been abusive, but he does get rude when he drinks. And he pays zero attention to me, the alcohol is all that matters.  He’s currently called in FMLA to work for two weeks as he’s been on a bender. 

Just before his bender we signed a contract to buy a home. So I’ve had to deal with the banks and paperwork all alone. It’s horribly stressful. And to top it off, I work at a major distillery.  I don’t come home smelling of alcohol because I work in a distribution warehouse. But even knowing I make our living off of the same product he’s killing himself with really makes me hate myself.  But I make triple what he does in wages, as it’s the highest paying place around and we can’t afford for me to leave.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m watching him kill himself and I’m powerless to help. Mainly because he does not want my help. Or anyone’s. We’ve offered rehab, doctors helping, everything but he insists to keep trying the failed tactics he’s always used by going it alone.   I guess I just needed to vent. I’m hoping this week maybe he will sober up some. I doubt it, but I have a little hope left. I’d do anything for him, I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do if he won’t tell me.",1

She uses the money she gets on alcohol, then when she's burned through it and suffering withdrawal, she begs me to buy her alcohol.

I have been clean from alcohol for about 5 months. Every test thus far has been clean and reading 0.000 BAC. On super bowl Sunday i went to the mall with my son and family with no alcohol consumed what so ever. I get home and take the test at 7:21 pm and it reads .000. This is where is gets fucky...

I took another test right before I was about to go to bed and it said I was 0.184 and told me to retest in 15 minutes...I had to do a double take because I genuinely didn't have a single drop of alcohol. I did the retest like it told me to and it read 0.027 at 10:07 pm and told me to retest again. I did the retest again and it read 0.358 at 10:23 pm. It asked for another retest and finally at 10:38 pm it read 0.000...

While the retests were happening I was frantically texting my probation officer with picture evidence and stating I did not have anything to drink what so ever. He didn't respond...I call in the morning and he thought it was strange that the readings were so fluctuated between the different results. I agreed and he contacted Soberlink. They said I was either drinking, the device somehow came in contact with some form of alcohol or the device is malfunctioning. My probation officer doesnt want to get a new machine for me and my attorney told me not to worry about it...well I'm worried sick...

I call the day report center to demand a EtG that can detect alcohol in urine up to 80 hours after consumption. They agree and I pass the test with nothing in my system proving my innocence.

My father is an alcoholic and despite admitting multiple times that he has a problem and should quit, he never does.

During COVID I moved back home and I’ve noticed the following changes and am wondering if anyone might have advice. I’m also unsure which of these may be related to alcoholism and which may be related to other health issues (depression, dementia, etc.)

&#x200B;

\- He drinks 12-18 beers a day (and is rarely sober)

\- He sleeps for 14+ hours a day

\- He forgets things (like which restaurant we ordered food from the night before)

\- He has begun mixing alcohol and marijuana (usually in the form of edibles)

\- He has no interest in any hobbies and rarely leaves the house

\- He misses doctor’s visits and refuses to reschedule despite numerous reminders that its for his health

\- When I invite friends over he encourages them to get drunk so they can ""have more fun""

&#x200B;

I was wondering if I could get a realistic opinion from people who live with alcoholism on my own drinking habits. For some context my parents are codependent alcoholics, and there are others in my family tree with a history of substance abuse other than alcohol. In my early twenties I drank a 12 pack a day, but I quit drinking for a year with some encouragement from my now wife (no programs/therapy), but eventually allowed myself to start drinking once more, understanding I can't let things get to that point again. Now I'm sure right off the bat you folks are probably yelling at your monitor for me to stay away from alcohol considering my family history and my own past, but I ask that you bear with me here.

&#x200B;

I know that alcoholism isn't something you just ""shake off"", and that it's something that will stick with me for my entire life. However the amount of alcohol I am consuming currently doesn't strike me as problematic (but what addict ever views their own use as problematic). As it stands now I drink, on average, every other day, and usually under 3 drinks. On Fridays or Saturdays I can get up to 8-10, but usually around 6. Generally speaking I don't get ""drunk"" during the week (no motor control/speech impairment), but weekends I sometimes get a little toasted, but again, not usually to the point I'm stumbling or my speech is impaired. I virtually never get blackout drunk any more.

&#x200B;

The reason I am here and telling you all of this is that my drinking has caused some tension to re-appear with my wife. She references articles and studies regarding how much is okay to drink, but frankly the limits seem laughably low (no more than two a night, 14 a week). I attribute this to the fact that ultimately alcohol is a poison and no matter what a person is better off not drinking vs drinking.

&#x200B;

Essentially I am trying to find a non-biased opinion of truly what I can expect for my health, and what is considered a ""normal"" amount to drink. My wife doesn't drink at all (her medication doesn't allow it and it was never really her thing anyway), and my family is not a good gauge either for obvious reasons. Thanks!

TL:DR

I drink \~3 drinks every other day, about double that on a weekend. Too much?

&#x200B;

edit:

I know that everybody is different, but if it's relevant I'm 5'10/180lbs. Also I am currently waiting on getting some tests done to investigate low testosterone as I have had some issues sleeping and reduced libido. Could be related, could not be, but it has been the catalyst for the tension with my wife surrounding my drinking as too much alcohol can have similar effects.",7

Hard liquor, wine, beer, I’d drink just about anything every night. I even reached a point where I drank mouthwash because I needed more. Now I can go 4-5 days without drinking. Am I getting better? do I really need to be stone cold sober to take back control of my life? Or can I eventually drink like a normal person again?

PS: the breakup made me resort to drinking. I never had cravings before the breakup, would just drink normally. Any thoughts??",84

I have been drinking quite a lot for a couple months. Basically daily with a few exceptions. I need to make sure I am not going to have WDs from alcohol and confuse it for suboxone withdrawals. Today I woke up feeling especially shitty withdrawals and am confused because the day before I felt better even though I was hungover. Just need to be very careful. I can’t afford another detox or to miss ANY work right now as I am getting a huge promotion in a month and need to grind it out to make that happen.

My SO has severe depression and very rarely has a good day so life is a fucking bummer sometimes.

I dont have depression but being in a relationship with someone who does takes a toll on you.

I've been staying up late drinking alone probably 6 days a week since  my 24th birthday in November. I always make excuses like ""I drink because it helps me relax after work"" and some bullshit like that.

I'm so embarrassed that I have to buy alcohol from a different store in town every day or so because the workers see me in their shops so often 

 Couple of drinks would be reasonable but I would drink about 10-12 beers or 2 bottles of wine and just sit there watching YouTube in the dark. I drink as fast as possible to get the buzz the fastest and I dont eat until I'm wasted stumbling around the kitchen for peanut butter sandwiches or something. Months ago I was fit, lifting weights everyday and walking my dog most nights but I havent had the energy to do anything for a long time now. Feels pathetic but good to get off my chest. 
Like a lot of people I've gotten covid fat,  lazy and demotivated.

Ive been telling myself that once I finish what I have im not buying any more drinks and then I do, so sick of myself 
I'm not drinking now,  its 2AM and I'm wide awake, bored of video games, YouTube and food. Drinking a ton of lemonade and pepsi to keep myself entertained.

Personally, i found it easier than i thought it was going to be. not because it was easy, but i had such a love for drinking that i thought everything would be boring and awful without it. I assumed that i would have constant cravings, which i have had- but they’re fairly manageable. I found that around day 3 is when i got wicked headaches and irritability. 

Right now i seem to be having lasting anxiety, i don’t know if that’s a detox-type side effect or if it’s my brain no longer having a distraction. 

I’m just happy that i started, i still have a long way to go but i think because i had such low confidence in myself and assumed i would slip up and drink again so there was no point to quitting, and slowly proving myself wrong has become the motivation that originally i could barely find. 

I’m also surprised by how different quitting is for everyone, and how the timeline can vary. 

Side note: i was a daily beer drinker of usually 3-6 a night, that’s too much for my size and in general but I’m well aware that it’s a lot less than what many people drink. So i know that my saying it’s easier than i thought May rub someone the wrong way because their withdrawals send them to the hospital or they experience DT.

2021-02-04 06:02:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lcdchc/advice_for_supporting_a_friend_with_alcoholism/,Advice for supporting a friend with alcoholism,"Hi, please let me know if this isn’t the right place for this.

My husband’s best friend who over the years has become a good friend to both of us and is beloved by our kids has had a drinking problem for quite some time. Two years ago he lost a high profile job due to drinking related behaviour. 
After that he seemed to rein it in but it was still always kind of in the picture. 

Recently, it seems to have gotten much worse - I was always aware that he snuck drinks but now it is really quite obvious and I am sad and scared for him. I know he is driving when he is drinking although he tries to hide it. I think he is drinking in the mornings and honestly with the level he drinks during the day/night he probably has to have a drink in the morning to deal with withdrawals. 

He is charming and witty and kind and would do anything for us - but he is not an open person at all and can be pretty awkward and anxious. My husband and all of our friends share my concerns but no one wants to bring it up with him because he so clearly doesn’t want to acknowledge it. 

I have a hard time not being super direct and I did bring it up with him once when he lost the job - just saying I was worried about his drinking, that it was obviously interfering with his life. He didn’t seem offended and kind of agreed and brushed it off quickly. 

My question is - am I right to say something? I don’t want to shame him, I want to be supportive of him. Any advice on how to word it in a way that comes across like that??

Secondly, he often comes to our house for dinner or to hang out and while we will have a few drinks he will drink a very large quantity and this makes me feel bad - like we are enabling him. But it would also be weird for us not to have a casual drink with him - we are all in hospitality - he could feel like we are being judgemental. Any advice on navigating this?

I know saying something could result in him pulling away from us, and while that would suck I would happily lose the friendship if I thought it would help him. 

Any insight?? Thank you.",3

I have struggled with mental illness (bipolar disorder mostly) and in my opinion some very unhealthy habits with drugs and alcohol. 

I have been drinking since I was 15 and blacking out pretty consistently, especially in the past couple years. 

I just recently moved my whole life and started fresh. The first few times I went out drinking with new friends I ended up blacking out twice. I realized today that it’s been 3 months since I last blacked out. This is probably the longest I have ever gone without blacking out. 

I actually feel in control now! I had been considering quitting drinking for a while because of the out of control feeling I often had but now I feel confident that I can continue drinking in moderation or going out and staying sober. 

Does anyone have any advice or opinions on my situation? I was pretty sure I was an alcoholic but kind of suddenly feel pretty different about it now.",12

    I’ll keep it as short and sweet as I can. I can  easily go out with some friends or have a night in with my girlfriend and enjoy a drink or two on occasion, and be totally fine, and carry out the night as I would sober. Other nights, maybe twice a month, I feel like just getting hammered, and it’ll last for a couple days. After day three or four I’ll decide “Ok enough is enough,” and sleep it off and feel fine the next day, go to work and carry on with usual business and hobbies etc.... 
      I realize this is slightly abnormal behavior, but it’s not really affecting my life negatively, besides my perception of myself, yet I continue (no one else really knows the extent.) 
      I can only chalk it up to being addicted to an actual bender over alcoholism, as strange and asinine as that sounds. I’m a bartender and we drink... heavily.. where I work, but half the time I take water shots or just one or two and have no problem turning it down before I start or after a couple. But like I said.. a couple times a month I can’t seem to stop myself from getting plastered for several days. Days on and days off, no one seems to notice. If they do, they don’t say anything, but we’ve fired countless people in the past for drinking too much on the job, and so far I’m getting nothing but promotions. 
    
   There is so much context that I know I’m excluding- a year ago I lost almost everything. My father passed away, my girlfriend broke up with me whom I lived with, so I lost my house, pets, majority of my possessions, my car was totaled in a Chipotle parking lot and still have no idea wtf happened but insurance didn’t buy it, then COVID hit and I lost my job (Bartending,) had moved in with my mother but collectively didn’t make 3 times our rent after they realized my dad had no more income and I couldn’t work, so we got kicked out when the lease was up (March.) 
     I do not want a pity party, because things are fine now. Moms and I found a comfortable place (after living for several months in the first shithole we found lol) We re-opened and I’m working obviously, new car, new gf, things are surprisingly great. 
     But I guess my big question is, am I going on these benders to consequentially run from the last few years? Or do I actually have a problem with alcohol that needs to be addressed? Or potentially both? I’m open to whatever. Thank you so much.",2

I’m an alcoholic. Not an obviously problematic one, which means I get told I’m not an alcoholic. Which has made not drinking harder. 

I go through three or four bottles of wine a week. Six months ago, it was much worse. A year ago, it was much better. 

I don’t want to give up drinking permanently. I love wine, I love being tipsy, I love how I am a lot more fun to be around, and have more fun, when I’m tipsy. I guess the problem (during Covid, and to a much lesser degree before Covid) is I am not fun when drunk. And the physical side effects are starting to get real bad — not just of drinking too much, but the massive decrease in socialization and exercise I’ve had since Covid means the other side effects of drinking are significantly telling now. 

I feel like it wasn’t that long ago when I could have one or two glasses of wine and just... stop there! It’s just not possible for me during Covid. The fact that I’ve been sheltering in place for almost a year has not been easy.

I’ve been drinking “better” the past few months. Moved from just wine to the low-cal sparkling booze (eg Whiteclaw) with the occasional bottle of wine. But I decided the best way to tackle my problems (with weight, with other side effects, with ensuring I stop upsetting my boyfriend) was to just stop until March. Zero booze until March. I can revisit this in March. Just gotta not drink until March.

But I want a drink. Just one glass of wine seems so harmless. I know it won’t be one glass. And I know I can’t ask anyone around me to stop me if I have one glass and then want another. I just... want a drink.

I’m typing this out so that I don’t drink. But Jesus, do I want one drink.",6

I didn't know I could do this. I'm a ""fake it til you make it"" kind of person, so when people asked if I thought I could stay sober, I always said ***yes***. No hesitation, no fear, nothing. I wasn't trying to lie, but I was not going to give alcohol the satisfaction of knowing that it had any power over me. But I didn't know, not for sure.

But here I am, at my desk, crying my eyes out because for the first time in my life I feel like I actually have something to be proud of myself for. I finally got tired of the way I was living and did something about it. And it's not over, it's never over, it's a decision I'll have to make every day.

Here's to another 6 months...and another. And another.",17

2021-02-01 18:47:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/lahwro/how_to_help_a_family_member_taking_steps_toward/,"How to help a family member taking steps toward sobriety, and how to cope? - Strong Trigger Warning for substance abuse, self harm, suicide, and alcoholism, and maybe homophobia","Please take the trigger warning seriously - I'm here posting honestly about how a loved one with a lifelong history of substance abuse has made me feel because I want advice on how to be helpful, but I'm going to be pretty harsh on him, because I want help and I have to be honest about my feelings in order to address them. I don't want to trigger a shame spiral, or bad memories, or god forbid relapse, for anyone.

My older brother (30 years old) has struggled with substance, alcohol, and mental health his whole life. It started maybe when he was 14 or 15, I was 11. He had just come out as gay, and without telling his story too much, we lived in a town where there was still a lot of homophobia. He started harming himself and threatening suicide, and then he spiraled into drinking, substance use, eventually selling drugs, and so on. (I haven't specified the substance because it changed several times).

Fast forward 15 years. My brother has spent almost a decade and a half living in this pained state, drinking daily, smoking incessantly, using different drugs, and eventually settling into a cocaine habit, living a lifestyle that has cycled between working class and fringe. In that decade and a half, I have so many bad memories. He was my idol growing up, I always wanted to be like him - even when his life started to unravel, I wanted to use drugs like him because he was using drugs, he was cool, he was my hero. It took a while for me to realize that he wasn't my hero - that he was violent with me, that he ignored me, he was mean to me, he'd forget about me, even after I'd travelled across the country to see him, that he'd relied on me to help his habit. Once, he punched me in the face while I was DD'ing him for no other reason than he wanted me to punch him and I wouldn't do it. He's abandoned me after seeing him from halfway across the country to literally score coke in an alley behind a bar and then go to a strip club. I once showed up to visit him and he just wasn't anywhere to be found. His roommate told me ""Oh yeah, he wanders in and out..."" And that's not even all.

And I have nearly a decade and a half of phone calls - phone calls saying he didn't care what happened to him, phone calls saying he'd amounted to nothing, phone calls saying ""what's the point, it's not like I'm going to live past thirty,"" phone calls of him sounding like shit, and me panicking, and sticking by him, and making sure he was safe, and probing him for information to make sure he had some sort of friends around, and trying to listen, and pick his spirits up. Phone calls of him saying he'd realized he had to stop drinking. Phone calls a week later drunk at 2pm. All these years of phone calls which made me feel like recovery wasn't possible for him, every time I'd hoped he'd started to turn his life around reality would crash back in a week later, and he'd be back where he was, like nothing had even changed, like we hadn't even talked.

But now, he's been stable for almost a year, and I don't know what to do. I say stable, not sober, because he is very clearly still an alcoholic. But for the first time, I don't sweat when he calls me - he sounds happy on the phone, and he consistently sounds happy on the phone, and each time he calls, even though the scared part of my brain keeps expecting him to sound bad again, he still sounds happy and in a good place. He's in a long term relationship. He's applying to go back to school. I feel so happy, I actually feel hopeful for him, but I also feel scared, because there's just so much history that's just dangling unaddressed. Years of neglect, meanness, bitterness towards the world and me. I have so many memories where I want to just say ""bro, what the fuck was that, how could you do that to me, why were you never there for me."" And I get scared because sometimes, he still talks about his past as if there were nothing wrong with it, as if he were proud of it.

I recently was on a phone call with him, and I brought up just one memory, just one time I felt he'd let me down, and he gave me the same excuse he'd given me when it happened: ""I was busy, I was going out of my mind from work, it was crazy."" And then we talked some more, and he finally admitted to me he had had a cocaine addiction (which I knew, but didn't know its extent), and that he's now maybe 6 months off cocaine. And he told me what it was like, how his addiction grew, how he kicked it. He even said ""and I know I'm an alcoholic."" And I told him how much better he sounded these days, and how happy that made me feel, and he said it was going to make him cry. It was the most honest conversation I can ever remember having with him.

But I still just feel precarious. I have some harbored anger, and mistrust. It's like he's changing for the better without acknowledging just how bad the past was, and I worry if he never acknowledges that he was wrong in the past, he won't be able to right himself in the future. But I don't know how I can address any of these things - how I can go back and tell him how his spiralling, his aggression, his maudlin phone calls, how any of that made me feel years later. And I'm terrified of making him feel bad or guilty by bringing up the past - the truth is, part of what I'm angry about is how responsible I've felt for protecting his mental health in the first place, how I've always felt guilty or worried about how anything I've done or said to him could have affected him because he might spiral out of control.

So some of this is just getting this off my chest, but I'm also here for advice. How can I help my brother get sober? How can I help him stay sober? How can I help him understand our shared history, and how can I move past my bad feelings? I still just feel as though I'm the only person who remembers anything in my family, who looks back at those years and thinks there was something wrong with them. Sometimes I feel like I'm imagining it, like it wasn't that bad, like I'm overreacting, because there's nobody else to acknowledge it was bad with me.

It scares me that I think I will have a problem soon and possibly I already do. I love the feeling from drinking two or three shots of whisky with my folks. I mean I really like it. I want to do it all the time and I would if I didn't have school and everything else.

~

That moment when you say you’re hungover and  “want to eat healthy” is the moment you should take extremely serious in the sense that you’re probably clear headed enough by then to devise some sort of plan to quit.

I, too, know of the insatiable thirst you talk about and is usually indicative of a true alcoholic. Not many people admit to this or even take note of it.

Kind of like a fat kid loving cake, alcohol is easily my “cake, potato chips, French fries, pie, fried dough topped with sugary icing (doughnuts duh!) and countless others all balled into one. If you haven’t figured out that these are all junk food e.g. unhealthy and definitely against any doctors recommendations to be consumed on a daily basis. . . That also holds true for alcohol 🍷 🍺.

If I was one to be able to only consume the real-life sized liquids in each of those emojis per day and then stop for the next 23 hours to come until my next drink(s), also limited to what’s shown in my emoji illustration,  I then probably wouldn’t have much reason to be commenting on this article as the repercussions of my actions would be so insignificant, I may as well chalk up breathing outdoor air pollution as my “deadly” habit of more importance and that I should really heed the advice of others on changing my “breathing habits” when outdoors as I’m sure of it I’ll eventually develop some sort of cancer in my throat, windpipe, and/or lungs eventually from the carcinogens in the air!!!

Sounds crazy, right? So is alcoholism.

Problem with my alcoholism is that it doesn’t stop at 1-2 or even three drinks, but rather three to four times that in a short period of time to be most honest. (12 drinks is probably more realistic in what it takes for me to achieve comfortable buzz).

I don’t know your education background but it doesn’t take a medical professional to say this is a bit excessive and the first thing to probably give out on someone drinking to this excess is either the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, all or only a couple on this short list and that doesn’t include the brain and mental health that is usually compromised as well. Sounds even more serious now I would hope.

And in HOPE, I hope this all helps in your endeavors to stay sober. If you’ve felt that you’re continually unsuccessful, take it from me that a 30 day in-patient program is usually necessary to get a better grip on life, as it turns out is seemingly impossible while floating around life drunk then hungover then drunk and then hungover again.",3

Im unfortunately diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well, so I know that the alcohol will surely trigger a nice episode of rapid cycling. I’m so disappointed in myself, but I know my guilt wont make anything better. This is just another learning experience/reminder that I will never be able to consume in moderation. I’ve been so stable the past few weeks, and I just threw it all away by deciding “just a glass” would be okay. Luckily, I’m not wasted, but I feel like I’m back to square one. I know I’m not, I’ve made it so far without drinking so I can surely do it all over again. I just wanted to put this out here as a reminder to myself and all of you that any drink will just make you want more. Whether your 20 years sober or 10 days, it will always be difficult to listen to logic rather than impulse. I appreciate this community greatly, and I will not let this setback stop me from my sobriety. If you have relapsed, don’t feel bad. It’s just another lesson teaching us that we can learn from our addiction and fight even harder the next time we have a temptation. We can do this.",12
