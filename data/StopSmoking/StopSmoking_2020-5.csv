I am on day two of quitting smoking (26f, 6-12 cigarettes a day) and I am finding it okay with the help of a vape (which I know isn’t ideal but in the UK is over 90% safer than smoking cigarettes). 

My problem is I have a history of eating disorders, and whilst I am ‘recovered’ the mental illness never fully goes away. I read that it is common to gain around 5kg in the months after quitting smoking because cigarettes apparently aid metabolism? This terrifies me because I don’t want to relapse with my eating disorder but I know I will if I gain that much weight without eating more food, if that makes sense?

I was wondering if anyone has successfully quit without gaining weight and if so, how did you manage? I know this might seem like such a silly problem but I am genuinely worried and whilst I know that smoking is bad for my health, I’m worried that my eating disorder might be worse.

Many thanks in advance.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9809941053390503}"

This is my 95th day and while it was easy in the beginning, I've become very sensitive and prone to get angry or almost start crying. The smallest things can set me off and it's been a rolercoaster.

Most of the things that set me off could annoy normal people off. I'm talking about situations like an asshole acquaintance who called me fat in a not so friendly way after I had been nice to him, and an condescending coworker who's insulting and generally disrespecting.

But instead of just getting annoyed, I start fuming instead and I've started to see the world as a very threatening place and my coworkers already commented on it, and I'm afraid I'll lose my temper at work one day like I lost it last week when I locked myself outside home.

I rarely have urges to smoke, it's just this shitty headspace I'm in that makes me want to smoke just to experience some normalcy again. I'm afraid that if I continue like that I'll lose my job, and create unnecessary conflicts with my friends.

That said, I need help. Do you have any recommendation on how to deal with it? Any words of comfort? Is it always going to be like this, or is this going to pass? Is this what I'm going through normal?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999118983745575}"

All I want is a nice tasty cigarette. That's what I miss the most, because of nostalgia of the countless times I spent in the pub that I can no longer go to due to the lockdown, because of the memories of my mum sat at the back door having a fag while I was eating breakfast (simpler times), the car rides as a child, where the driver was smoking and I was sat there playing my gameboy in the backseat.

The point is I have so many fond memories of smoking but...

My grandfather died earlier this year, diagnosed with lung cancer 20 years after quitting. He was one of them 40 a day kinds when he smoked. He smoked for near 40 years.

He was diagnosed with heart problems at the age of 53 and quit immediately. He never smoked again. There's not a day goes by that I don't thank him for this, because I got to meet him and know him until I was 25 years old. If he hadn't of quit I wouldn't have got any where near the amount of time I got with him. I miss him everyday.

And that's why I say NO to cigarettes now, without hesitation, that's why I am thankful my mum, dad, nan and everyone else in my family has quit. We don't have much time to meet our own family and its so much easier for me to say no than it is for my sister to tell my nephew why I'm not around anymore.

&#x200B;

Also, this made me realize that trying so hard to quit ,counting the days and making it seem like challenge will only make it harder to acheive since you're making it look like a big deal by constantly thinking about it . What you should do instead is let go of it and move on with your life without giving it  too much thought because its mostly a mental challenge instead of a physical one. 

And say you had a smoke after a while because of a stressful event or something of that sort, don't let that get into you making you feel like you failed and be filled with shame, but instead think of yourself as non smoker who just had a cigarette and then moved on with his life.

3 months ago I swapped the vape for nicotine lozenges.  In addition, I will have a cigarette if offered, but I never go and buy a pack....the habit of smoking is pretty much broken but I do enjoy one at a night out.  Especially with alcohol.

So, I just threw my lozenges in the bin and I randomly had a cigarette from ages ago in my desk and smoked that so I now have nothing.  

I got a pack of mints to munch if I miss the lozenges.

When I tried to quit cigarettes before vaping and NRT, my brain was utterly fried and I could have killed someone.  

Any reason for me to expect this to be easier given I don’t actually inhale anything regularly, just suck on nicotine lozenge all day?

2020-05-28 07:25:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/gs4hw7/my_diagnoses_helped_me_quit/,My diagnoses helped me quit.,"Long ago I had promised my wife I'd quit smoking one day. Last September on my 30th birthday I started to takesmall steps to improve my physical and mental health. By late September I had stopped smoking and had an appointment with my GP to figure out how to deal with concentration and focus issues that I've had for a long time. 

As it turns out, I was diagnosed with ADHD. One of the symptoms of undiagnosed ADHD in adults is self medicating through nicotine and caffeine which tend to (inefficiently) make up for some missing/deficient neurotransmitters in an adhd brain.

While I had made the intention to quit, the diagnoses helped me separate myself from my addiction, the subsequent medication then provided a small relief from the withdrawal.

I don't want to give the impression that there's meds that help quit smoking. All my previous 4-5 relapses involved me missing the smokers corner and the break from routine that a cigarette brought. But just the mental switch that I don't need to depend on a cigarette because I'm getting what my brain actually needs from the right medicines helped me fight the cravings.

My meds initially also restricted me from drinking and the post beer buzz smoke break that would have been my kryptonite also faded away.

My takeaway for other would be to utilize the advice of doctors and pharmacists regarding smoking. I knew i had a personality that was prone to addiction but I had never even heard of the actual chemical connection between ADHD and nicotine/caffine addiction.

Please don't self-diagnose or self-medicate. While there's the general misconception that ADHD is over diagnosed in children, the fact that it is so under diagnosed in adults perpetuates this misunderstanding even more. I made this post just as a reminder that most adults with undiagnosed ADHD including myself resign themselves to the idea that I'm just flawed and broken but it doesn't have to be the case  if you can afford it do check up some ADHD resources on the adhd subreddits if something resonates with you it can be the first step towards a healthier outcome.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973989725112915}"

I’ve never tried joining a community the handful of times I’ve tried to stop, so I thought I would give it a try! 

I had this smoking malarkey under control for 4 months. Then I went to my Christmas do, didn’t smoke all evening, even in the pubs. 

Then we went back to a friends house and I caved to my own logic of “rewarding myself for being so good”. After one cig, I thought “I may as well make the most of this situation and smoke a few”. 

The next morning I had a craving and thought “it’s Christmas, I’ll smoke a bit over the festive period”. 

18 months later, I’m now only 4 days clean. I feel like I’ve been asleep again. I’ve gone from over 20 a day to nothing and quit caffeine at the same time (as one begets the other for me and I was drinking too much of the stuff anyway 7-8 cups of coffee/tea a day) 

The first 3 days have been hell. I’ve not tried replacement therapy as I don’t wish to replace one thing with another, as all my friends have with the e-cigs they now never let go of! 

I don’t really have a point to this this post lol Just to say Hello, I hope you are all doing well and I wish you all the best with your progress and success in this endeavour.

I'd tried quitting a couple times.   normally would last a month,  3 months,  6 months,   honestly...  it was the holidays that would get me.  Traveling home to see family always stressed me out.     Or my gf who was working overseas, and still smoked...  would come back to the states,  and i'd fall back into smoking.     


but.  I had a talk with a doctor,  not that it was some dire moment,  but it just sort of resonated,   I needed to quit.     I live in nyc.  It's expensive to smoke here.   I was making me unhealthy,  it was a crutch.    And honestly,  all those childish  ""it's cool"" elements aren't really cool when you're older,  you just realize you're addicted and you have a habit.       


have stuck with it though.     June 1  will be a year and there's no reason to believe i won't make that...and keep right on going.     


I feel a lot better.   I don't have that shitty cough,  or like phelgm in the morning.   My day isn't a sequence of habitually lighting up every time i get outside.   I got back into hiking and being outdoors.   --trying to get my shit together on being healthier/losing weight.         


but just wanted to say.   If you want to quit,  you can.    Can fail plenty of times,  and still quit.     I maybe tried quitting a solid dozen or more times.    Sometimes it'd last,  sometimes not,   but i was trending towards not smoking.   Now i feel i have enough time under me,  to basically have kicked the habit.     I would be lying to say the urge doesn't hit every now and again.  Out drinking with friends who smoke,  or after a really stressful day,  seeing my GF light up on my fire escape, i think about maybe bumbing one.    But i can say those urges become less and less pressing and now, it's mainly nostalgia.    Easily ignored.     


So if you're struggling,  and this helps.   know that you can give it up.    And you'll be better for it.    Know that the first 48-72 hours are the real hell,  first week,  will be rats in the brain,  but after that... each day that passes,  it's easier and easier.   The pull less and less,  and you'll feel better the longer you go without smoking.     You'll save a ton of money,   and most likely be much healthier just for having stopped.

This is my third attempt at quitting. First two times I made to about 2/3 months (all within in the last year) and then relapsed. I’m really proud because the first day has always been the hardest for me and I’m confident that I’ll make it past my previous accomplishments at this point. My advice - don’t listen to yourself when you start thinking “one cigarette isn’t going to stop my progress.” It always turns into 2 then 3 then “okay I’ll just smoke today and stop again tomorrow” and then “alright let me just enjoy this week” and then you’re back to your old self. Each time I relapsed I was out with friends partying. They’re social smokers and can drop the habit easily. Point is... you may be able to drop the habit again if you relapse but remember how god damn challenging it is to even get past day one. Don’t test yourself unnecessarily.

I'm gonna try NRT this time. I was smoking around 10 a day but the last two weeks about 15. I'm wondering if I should start with step 1 or 2.

So, I'm sure you guys don't need to hear this but there is literally NO such thing as 1 Cigarette.

I was 2 and a half months into my quit, cold turkey and worked for the first time since the pandemic hit and smoked one on Monday and quickly have gotten up to 4/5 a day. I think the most frustrating part is how many times I've quit and thought ""One won't be bad. I probably won't like it and it will reinforce my decision to quit"".

And while mentally I know that I don't like it, I'm back in the trap. The most important thing is to keep in your mind in those moments why you are choosing not to smoke.

I know this is probably the wrong way to go about it, but I will be quitting again when I am done working on Saturday and heading back home.

I have had a difficult time quitting but am currently trying again for what I want to be the final time. Please feel free to share your experiences! I'd like to connect with this community. 

I've noticed one of the tactics I utilize to quit smoking is not looking for time to pass. Everyone is different, but I've found that waiting/ deliberately focusing on reaching benchmarks like 2 weeks or 6 months brings about more anxiety and doesn't allow you to stay in the moment. I think as smokers, we tend to always get excited to buy a pack or get on break or anticipate other moments when we get our nicotine fixes again. Our bodies are used to that craving for benchmarks. Those physical sensations stay with us and that's one of the hardest parts about quitting. When we finally quit, we have to train ourselves and our sense of time to cope with those feelings of anticipation, which can manifest as agitated emotions. For me, these agitated emotions manifest as bad moods. This has been the most challenging aspect to avoiding relapse and where I believe stress management techniques in the form of physical activity can greatly improve quitting success. 

Learning how to live in the moment with our brains and recognizing these aspects of nicotine addiction help us learn to be our natural selves again. We have gone years learning to seek out tobacco, no matter how desperate or shameful at times. We must learn how to recognize the physical sensations, mental associations, and social situations which trigger an urge to smoke. 

It is MUCH easier said than done, but I wanted to give this input to help people quit smoking for good. It isn't 'just about physically stopping smoking. Many people do NOT understand this addiction.

Questions about smoking and heart rate.," So, I stopped ( more like am too scared to start again ) smoking a week back. I started in January this year and at the end was down to 3 - 4 cigarettes per day in May , 5 sometimes. While I was smoking two independent events occurred that made me really scared. Once in April, after smoking, my heart rate suddenly spiked, I felt like collapsing , body felt a little arrested and I felt like I was losing senses. I was sweating profusely and couldn't move away from the air conditioning. This stayed for 5-10 mins and then it was alright. On asking, it turned out to be a panic attack. So I didn't go the clinical way given the risk of COVID 19 nowadays. Next , it happened last Monday. After I smoked one cigarette in the afternoon, my heart rate jumped again. This time nothing else happened, just felt uneasy. But this went on for almost 2 hours, my heart was consistently beating at more than 110 bpm. I got scared and consulted a physician. He said there seemed no immediate danger, but advised to out me under observation for 2 days and still found nothing. The doctor told me that it mightve been due to hypertension or a mix of factors. Otherwise he said my all reports were normal. So after returning for the past 1 week, I haven't been able to touch them and good or bad feels about it apart, I'm planning to keep it the same way so that I can stop it from being an addiction given the rate at which I was doing. But I just need to ask you people, that has something similar happened with any of you as well ? Is it frequent ? If you consulted a doctor , what did the doctor say ? Are any other factors apart from smoking also at play here ? Thanks.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974728226661682}"

New to the group in hopes someone might know what’s causing these painful headaches everyday. I’ve been chewing nicotine gum now for almost a year. To be honest I just enjoyed nicotine overall and figured it was the safest way to ingest it. Well about 4 weeks ago I started the patch to ween off nicotine completely. I was still chewing the gum when I got a big craving but usage went from roughly 14 pieces of 4mg a day down to about 5. 

On May 15th I got a box of 2mg to take it down again before I move on to the step 2 patch. Last week I started taking the patch off at night to help me sleep better. I was having horrible dreams wearing the patch through the night. 

Well last week I got a headache that pretty much hasn’t gone away since mid last week. Sometimes are worse than others but it is always there. Do you guys think this could be due to the nicotine ween off or possibly something else? I’m half tempted to get some 8MG zyn patches and see if that takes the headache away quickly that way I can be certain.

It's definitely achievable!","Long story short I briefly regularly smoked from age 16 to about 19/20. It was short but intense, I mean I went from a pack a month to a pack a week, to dipping because ""it was more convenient"" (aka stronger and more frequent). I was on and off for about a year or two after that occasionally vaping or smoking when drunk, but eventually I just quit all together. 

I know this is a much shorter time-frame than many of you have been smoking, but I still think I have something worthwhile to say. I remember it took me a few times of ""quitting"" to finally stop smoking when I was regularly smoking. It took me about a year or two after actually quitting to realize that moderation wasn't possible. It's been about four or five years since quitting and I never think about it, it's not a daily drain and I don't have any cravings or if I do it's the yearly fleeting thought. I don't mean I rarely think of it, *tobacco is literally not something I think about as a part of my life.* I'm not insulated from other smokers either, my entire family smokes and many of my friends smoked in college. Some of my coworkers smoke now. It's not anything that takes up space in my mind or is a burden, it's literally just not there.

Some of my friends recently quit, and they did it by reading Allen Carr's EASYWAY to quit smoking book. I was very skeptical in the beginning, I mean how could a book help you quit? You  need willpower, right?

I have never been so wrong my entire life!  


The book is about 110 pages, I sat down one night and read it in one go, while smoking of course. Let me tell you fellow redditors, quitting smoking is the easiest thing I have ever done in my life. The next day I went to a houseparty, we got extremely drunk, and I never even THOUGHT about smoking. No cravings, no nothing, just compassion for people who still smoke.

I have stopped smoking a week ago, and I know for certain, that I will never ever want to smoke again, and I never will, and that there is nothing really hard about quitting.   


When I felt miserable during previous attempts to quit, it was because I thought I was giving something up. I wasnt, clearly. The book helps you get rid of of the media brainwashing that got you to think smoking was good in the first place. That is the key, that is what will make YOU quit EASY.

Early last June I moved to another country and decided that I wouldn't learn about cigarette brands here so I that I wouldn't know what to buy if I had the urge. The first couple months were very difficult, as expected. I thought about smoking all the time. I dreamt about it several times a week. Intrusive, persistent thoughts about how badly I wanted to smoke.


Then in December I went to a wedding and bummed cigarettes off people throughout the evening. It felt great. It felt really, really satisfying. The funny thing is, my brain let up on me about smoking. I didn't have the cravings, I didn't dream about it. That lasted maybe a month. Then it all started up again. Finally out of desperation I got another one from a kind stranger in the grocery store parking lot. Same thing: felt great, cravings let up.


So I have been indulging in a single cigarette every 2-3 weeks. And it helps, but I'd like to stop bumming off strangers and I don't want to get a pack for myself because then I'll definitely go up to at least a couple a week if not daily routine smoking like I used to.


It seems everyone says that the intense cravings let up within 3 months or so. And by 6 months you'll look back and can't believe you ever stayed a smoker for so long. This has not been my experience. Here I am, nearly a year later, still getting hit with intense, jarring cravings. I still miss being a smoker and think about it often. Also I keep reading that cravings let up after 20 minutes or so. Mine might *fade* for about 20 minutes but go on for hours and hours. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because all day all I've been thinking about is getting in the car to go buy a pack. I haven't, but it's hard.

God is this awful though. I forgot how much it hurts. How much I have to breathe before I react to the slightest annoyance. How sucky sleep is. My biggest issue is sleep, I’m so restless. I slept in hour intervals last night, waking in between sweating and in pain. 

I think I got this though. I think my biggest obstacle will be sleep, so if y’all have any advice in regards to that I’d be very very thankful.

This is either a question for those who did the whole nicotine patch schedule, using progressively weaker patches over 8-12 weeks, or who have experience quitting with only smoking 1-4 cigarettes a day. For either group, did you have withdrawal symptoms after stopping the patch, or quitting light smoking? This is what I'm trying to assess. I've gone through nicotine withdrawals cold turkey from cigarettes several times.

I've been on the patch since March 2nd I think. I started with the 14 mg patch, and was smoking about 10-15 cigarettes a day, depending on if I was drinking or not. The last month before I quit it was ten or so though a day. So, in about a week it will be 3 months with no cigarette, using nicotine NRT. Now I'm on the 7 mg patch and only wearing it 7 hours as of today. For about 12 days before that I was wearing it 8 hours (9, 10, 11, 12 hours etc before that). This equals 2.04 and 2.33 cigarettes a day, respectively. So, I've definitely weaned down. I have an excel chart with dates, lol.

There are people who say that it will be mild because I'm down to a very moderate level of nicotine (2 cigarettes a day equivalent). This seems the most likely to me. There are some people that I spoke to who said most of the addiction is actually to nicotine + the other chemicals in tobacco that potentiate the nicotine. Also, the patch especially is such gradual release that people don't get the same plasma levels of nicotine until like 5 hours in to wearing it, compared to smoking. Gum and lozenges get a little closer to the cigarette spike in nicotine. Hence, one goes through much of the \*real\* withdrawals early on in NRT because they simply aren't getting the same brain effect, from either the spike nor synergistic chemicals. It's hard to tell though, because one is also gradually reducing their NRT dose. Switching from 14 mg/day to 7 mg/day alone can cause withdrawal symptoms. In this view, I may have little to zero withdrawals after stopping finally.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9964919686317444}"

I’ve tried stuff like e cigarettes but nothing worked. She always said it the only thing she can really enjoy in life and it made me sad.

The prognosis for this form cancer ist bad and I’m lucky if makes it for two more years. She just turned 66 last month.

Everything went pretty bad from that point, because of her brain Surgery one of her eyes is permanently closed and because the cancer has spread to her spine, it attacked her nerves and left her unable to walk or stand. 
The pain she went through unbearable to witness.

To make the long story short, she needs to be completely taken care of she is in the hospital for two months now. She will not be able to return home and has to live in foster care.

Last year, I quit smoking on April 1st. I maintained that for a full year - and it was satisfying and GOOD. After a month, I hardly even wanted to smoke. I was free! So the 11 months that followed were easy, even at parties, even when I'd been drinking.

Around March this year I thought it'd be okay to have a cigarette, just one, at a get-together with friends. Since then, I've smoked a couple of cigarettes once every two weeks. This started increasing, and whilst I'm not at the point where I'm smoking daily, I still feel the need to. Sometimes I do, during my quarantine walks. When I don't smoke one particular day, it's not for a lack of wanting to. 

As I was walking today, I made a decision: I'm re-joining this subreddit and I'm going to quit cold turkey again on June 1st. That is a peaceful thought. You might wonder (rightfully so) why I'm not quitting immediately. It's not the build-up that I need, but simply a well-rounded number. June 1st, it sounds clean. 

I kind of look forward to purging myself from this bad habit. And I am grateful for having learned something new about myself: it cannot be a casual smoker. There you have it. I always suspected it, but now I know.

I'm a recovering alcoholic (who only drank gin and Lagunitas IPA) and former druggie (anything anyone had at the time, mostly ecstasy a few times a day) with an addictive personality, and I only managed to quit those because I got sick for a while and stopped, and after the withdrawals (enough to send me to the hospital) Iam purely frightened of drugs and alcohol now.  Thankfully after a while I went to get some blood work and tests done and am blessed that none of that had any long term noticeable affects, other than on my personality (I have no self control now after years of just not caring)

I've been blessed with a wonderful life and want to stay healthy and live a long life.  My main hobbies are video games (as an actual hobby not just for casual sessions), 3d printing, target shooting (I find it therapeutic trying to lob an object and hit a taget and I suck at golf and darts, and learning new computer skills (Java, building/tinkering with computers, video editing and trying to get into 3d design).

I'm in the Tortilla business and this has affected me there to, from having to leave the production line every 10 minutes to the noticeable distaste of clients/market owners who can smell the smoke on me and see the ash that blows out of my car when I open the door.

By being present with our thinking and accepting the associated feeling we can break the connection between the initial thoughts and acting to satisfy the desire, increasing our chances of long term wellbeing.

I quit cigarettes cold turkey sometime before easter with the help of Alan Carr's book. Up until a few days ago I was doing great apart from some pretty gnarly cravings the first week or so.

Now it seems that the cravings are back, but in a different form. It's no longer the physical sense of urgency and unease that it was at the beginning, which was probably down to the nicotine itself. It's more like my own mind keeps telling me there's no way I can go the whole rest of my life without ever smoking again so I might as well just go for it. Nothing matters anyway so I might as well just buy a pack. 

To use the analogy in the book, it feels like I've defeated the nicotine monster only to stumble upon a much bigger, much scarier monster. It's hard to view this as a simple consequence of a nicotine addiction when it's been so long since I had any nicotine and the feeling is so much different. Today I even got in line at the tobacconist's, ready to buy a pack when right at that moment I got a message friend checking in on me. That snapped me back into reality and I walked away without buying them but I'm worried there will be nothing to stop me next time. This is the closest to smoking I' ve ever felt since the moment I quit. 

TL;DR I'm experiencing a second wave of withdrawal a month and a half after quitting, where the cravings are different but somehow cut deeper.

If anyone out there experienced something similar I'd love to hear how you got through it. If not, well maybe writing it down is the first step to understanding it. Stay strong folks!",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9874041080474854}"
2020-05-22 11:42:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/golnvg/this_drug_should_be_illegal/,This drug should be illegal!,"I've been smoking half a pack a day for 13+ years. Using a tracking app, I smoke roughly once every 2 hours, which is actually the half-life of nicotine. I can push it up to 4-5 hours by taking naps, showers, eating junk food, cleaning things, etc, but then the symptoms of withdrawal from this drug kick in.

My head feels cloudy, I can't focus or think properly, I get stressed & irritated by everything.... in other words, I can't be working and doing anything important in such a state. And seeing how withdrawal symptoms last weeks (!), I can't even image how I could sleep & go to work.

On the other hand, I got emphysema and first signs of COPD, -- and this is not even the main problem. The main problem is my horrible teeth and my lack of smell (people often surprise me by telling me that I smell, and I don't even realize it myself). I'm saying the main problem, as this affects other people and not just me. I'm constantly using mouth wash and never smile...

If I stopped smoking, I would have enough money to buy the latest gaming laptop every Christmas.

2020-05-21 23:13:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/gobh1m/any_advice_on_stopping/,Any advice on stopping?,"I've been a smoker since I was 14, and have been smoking for over a decade now. I've been trying to quit for 3 years at this point, and I just can't seem to quit.
I've tried numerous things. My first attempt was cold turkey, and that lasted about a month before I caved. Me second attempt at cold turkey lasted even less.  
I've tried ecigs. It worked for a while, I gradually decreased the amount I smoked cigs by 2 a week and eventually I was only using ecigs. Somewhere along the line I started doing both again, until I realized at one point that my nicotine consumption was almost double than before I started with ecigs.   
After that, I tried gradually decreasing the amount I smoked. I went down from more than 1 pack a day to 6 a day. I had hit the point where I couldn't decrease anymore. I stayed there for a couple of months, but then a stressful period of my life started and I went back to a full pack.   
I tried decreasing a while after that again. This time, I bought a whole carton and gave it to my roommate. I asked him to give me 10 a day and decrease it by one every 2 weeks.  It worked for a while, but somewhere along the way I started buying extra packs to supplement what I was getting. I felt horrible for asking my roommate to do this for me and then going behind his back. Eventually, that arrangement stopped.   


I've tried this with my girlfriend too, and again, I went behind her back in the end. It is one of the reasons we broke off eventually.   


I've tried just eating some candy every time I start craving a cig, but then I just end up doing both.   
I've tried awarding myself points for every cig I don't smoke that's below 10(So if I smoke 6, I get 4 points for that day) and then at the end of the week, I spend the same amount of points in dollars on something nice for myself. 
I can't remember the reason why I stopped with this. 


I sometimes calculate how much money I've spent on smoking and list the various things I could've done with that money, hoping it'll work as a motivator. I remind myself continually of nice things I could save up for if I set my smoking money aside.

Nothing seems to work.
But yeah, I've reached a new low at this point. Due to various reasons (Covid19 aint helping for sure) I'm having some financial struggles at the moment. There have been a few instances where I've bought a pack of cigs instead of food with the justification that an empty stomach lasts for a couple of hours and a pack of cigs lasts for 2-3 days. And I know that if I don't stop, I'll keep making similar shitty decisions. Plus being financially unstable means that I'm starting to smoke more due to stress.  I've started smoking increasingly more disgusting brands to come by. Stuff I would've flat out thrown in the trash at one point. 

I've tried the carrot. I've tried the stick. I've tried both at the same time. nothing. nada. 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I know I need to stop. I want to stop. But nothing seems to help. 
I'd love to hear things you did to make you stop successfully.

EDIT:
From what I've noticed, I smoke for the following reasons (well, apart from being addicted of course):
1. Boredom. Plain having nothing to do. I've noticed that when I am unemployed or have nothing to do, I smoke more. Quarantine  certainly doesn't help here. 
2. Stress. enough said.   
3. When I'm thinking/studying. I'm honestly not sure if that also just falls under stress, however. 
4. Just hanging out with friends. I don't know how to explain it. It feels like the urge is different somehow, but somehow I just keep smoking a whole lot more and don't even notice it till my pack is empty. 

Things that have unintentionally helped in the past were having a job where I was just so busy that going out for a smoke didn't even enter my mind or was infeasible, and going to classes. Both of those are just environments where I'm just not allowed to smoke for x period of time. And both are things that covid19 has deprived me of for now.


I have used acid and MDMA in the past, both which I haven't done in years now. It was pretty easy to stop doing acid, since I did it pretty infrequently and I the addiction potential is pretty low there. 
I eventually reached a point where I did MDMA every day for a week in a row, and one day I just woke up, decided that nah, I don't want to fuck up my life forever. I flushed my stash down the toilet. I caved once, but that was it. 
I find it so incredibly frustrating. MDMA, in terms of what it gives you (an incredible, euphoric feeling for a couple of hours) is just soooo much better than what cigs give you. 
I have no clue how I was able to just... stop using it, but nothing seems to work for cigs. I feel like I can't adequately put it in words how I feel about it.",3,"{'covid': 2, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998840868473053}"

In the past, I've switched to vaping... (which always gets out of hand, and i wind up LITERALLY sucking on a vaporizer every waking moment of the day, crippled mentally by nicotine overdose) and I've also tried the gum. 

The gum worked for me in the past, so i decided to try it again on new year's of this year.  3 months in, and i was in a deep depression, spiraling out of control. I could barely get out of bed every morning. I was feeling aches and pains in my arms, my chest, my back, my throat. I was seeing a doctor to figure out if i had cancer.  I was depressed and paranoid DAILY.  i couldn't even work. I was home daily. I was using HALF of a 2mg piece of nicotine gum every hour. I kept a white board to write down the exact time i began chewing a new piece... 

After 3 months of this pure hell, i decided to start cutting that HALF piece in half.  So now i was taking one QUARTER of a 2mg piece of gum, each hour. This is when i started having blood pressure scares, heart palpitations, EXTREME panic attacks where my heart would beat so HARD AND FAST that id have to lay down and pre-dial 911... and i was now EXTREMELY fatigued and depressed. I started noticing that if i did anything that took focus, I'd feel sped up and I'd have a horrible DANGEROUS panic attack. But if i laid down for hours with my eyes closed, i felt sooo tired that i was sure i would pass out and never wake up. 

So one day, i decided to buy a pack of cigarettes, and, although smoking that 1st pack made me uncomfortable, i haven't had a single panic attack since. 

Is this normal? Do i have an underlying condition? Should i talk to a therapist about this? I feel like if I'm ever going to quit nicotine, i might need an anxiety drug or maybe even an antidepressant for a few months. Is that normal? Do you think i could request an anxiety drug or something? I'm really worried about having a heart attack the next time i try to quit. Im only 30 and i can't imagine having a panic attack like that at 40 or 50 or 60.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999414324760437}"

I did not smoke for a month and half but vaped the last three weeks with low nicotine. 

I found out two things: 

Vaping doesn’t help me quit smoking. Some say it does. Some say it doesn’t. I just found out it won’t help ME. So the next time there will be no vaping. It’s even worse since I can do it at my desk while working from home and I puff along nonstop...

I feel this kind of hole in me that wants to be filled but I don’t really know how. For some time I filled it with gaming which I quit a few days ago since I had the feeling I put way too much time in it and couldn’t get anything done in real life! I was only happy while I played. Not after. 

It’s the same with smoking. I was smoking out of boredom I guess.

Given my history with thyroid problems, hashimoto, anxiety and depression I think I am still depressed which is the root cause why I want to fill this void and smoking always gave a little bit of comfort... of course not in the long run...

I will quit again! I’m smarter than the last time!I’m happy that, even while vaping, my daily coughs are totally gone and I feel better and a little more energized than when I smoked 12-15 cigarettes a day!

I went and bought myself a vape, telling myself that if I just vape for the rest of my life it's better (and cheaper) than smoking, and at least my kid wouldn't grow up associating the smell of stake cigarettes with dad. 

Over the next 6 months or so I slowly ramped down my nicotine content to zero, mixing my higher content juice with lower. Here's the thing - for a while you compensate, sure, and use it more, but eventually you can't keep up. And once the nicotine is gone, using the vape feels silly. I still have it - it's in my pocket right now - and I take a puff once every few weeks, probably, on average. I also stopped inhaling. But I rarely even think about cigarettes anymore, and the idea that I used to smoke every day is almost unimaginable. 

This is doable. I quit more times than I can tell you, over and over, and each time my brain said ""you can't do this, just give up"" and I listened to it and gave it the fix it wanted. But you can do this. My method worked for me, something else might work for you. But you can do it, and you should do it. You owe it to yourself.

TLDR; Mom quit life long smoking habit. Now has severe swelling & it seems related to quitting nicotine. Looking for any information or similar stories.

Hello fellow redditors who have or are making the steps into cigarette free life!
I myself quit smoking 4 1/2 years ago and can say that it almost feels like I never smoked at all. Count me fortunate that anytime I ever slipped, it made me feel so sick after than I cant even imagine picking the habit up again.

BUT THIS POST IS NOT ABOUT ME! Actually this post is about my lovely mother. About a month after I quit, she also quit smoking (COLD TURKEY Y'ALL. After reading the ""Easy Way"" by Allen Carr) I was and am still so very very proud of her. She smoked for 30+ years and loved it. I never thought she'd stop but here we are.

Not long after she quit, the usual weight gain ensued. Same thing happened to me and my boyfriend. Standard stuff. But as the months and eventually years went on, we realized she hadn't just gained weight, she was SWOLLEN. Like full water retention swollen, painful to touch her skin because it felt puffy like when you get stung by a bee or have an allergic reaction. The extent of this swelling can best be described by how its impacted her life. 

Before quitting, she weighed 120 lb soaking wet, mostly muscle. Very very fit, extremely agile, strong and an avid yoga student. She never needed help moving the couch and could twist herself into knots. AFTER quitting, my mom has a hard time bending to tie her shoes because the swelling at her core is so bad. She can't walk very long or up hill without noticeable increase in swelling and exertion (you can see it in her face getting puffy)
 
Obviously she's been to many many doctors. So many tests on her heart, hormones, immune system. You name it, they have looked into it. 

One day she made the suggestion to her doctor that it had to do with quitting smoking. They don't discount it and have told her to go ahead and try patches to see if that helps in any way. She decided to give it a go and grabbed the lowest nicotine % patch at the pharmacy. This helped a little but not tons. Due to the pandemic, she only this past week has been able to get the next level in nicotine patches, but I can say for sure that when I saw her at the end of the last week to when I saw her briefly the other day, the swellings gone down a good amount.


SO MY QUESTION IS:

Has anyone else experienced this? If so, have you found any possible reasons why this would be happening to her? Not looking for a diagnosis, this is the internet after all. Just looking for experiences others may have and information that may point her and her doctors in the right direction.",1,"{'immun': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9806092381477356}"

2020-05-20 13:05:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/gnf9gy/really_struggling_during_lockdown/,Really struggling during lockdown.,"I've considered myself smoke-free since Jan 1st 2019. I've had a handful of slipups since then, mainly in the form of smoking a cig or two when out drinking, but I always just shrugged them off the next morning, decided not to stress about them and kept going. It worked so far and I was completely without slipups since June 2019.

This spring, however, I've relapsed way more than usual. I smoked half a cigarette in February, a few during a night out in March and finally, I relapsed twice within one week this month. Each time, I'd buy a pack, smoke 3-5 cigarettes in a day/evening and then just get disgusted with myself and dispose of the pack.

The latest relapse was on Sunday and I've been without since. I think all this time I have being locked up and alone is getting to me, plus my depression and anxiety are way worse than usual. I know I technically should reset my badge but I know I'll just get dejected, consider all my efforts during the last year lost and just fall back into smoking so I decided not to do that, nor reset my quit trackers. I still got this, the milk is not split, I just need to get over this slump and keep going.

Thing is, I felt awful physically every time after I smoked. I'd get shortness of breath, throbbing headache, dizziness as the toxic compounds make their way to my body, I'd feel like puking and the smell and taste in my mouth would bother me for hours afterwards. I don't get any physical pleasure from smoking, it's purely an emotional thing.

I’m a perpetually angry person due to work so you can only imagine what a joy I am to be around going through nicotine withdrawals.

Both this recent attempt and my other most successful attempt (2 days) I had just listened to Easy Way by Alan Carr. I think it’s immensely helpful but I have one issue with it: he essentially advises you consciously smoke your last cigarette and make a solemn vow that you will never smoke again.

The thing is, I’ve made many such vows and then failed countless times. Then of course after making my *super* solemn vows using his method, I have failed as well. So obviously I don’t have much confidence in this practice.

added that this is not something i am proud of  , and i also dont consider it anything better .  i know i can do much better than this , but this coronavirus thing and  lockdown , sitting at home with no job , no work to do has added more anxiety to what i used to have in regular days . i am also not a person with much resources . so it is what it is , i am just hoping i find strength and willingness to get rid of my nicotine need for good .

It's been a long journey in harm reduction for me since I started smoking cigarettes all those years ago. I hopped on the vape train for a a good few years too, but found myself terribly addicted to the hand and mouth ritual of that.

Quitting vaping actually took a foray into the world of ""clean nicotine"": NRTs. I used the nicotine inhaler for a few months to replace the hand to mouth habit of vaping, then I switched to gum for a few weeks when I went on vacation overseas.

Then came the humble lozenge, probably the most convenient NRT imo, and I locked into a daily habit of 15 or so 4mg lozenges under a 3 month program sponsored by the Canadian government. And what's worse is I didn't taper or anything just switched over.

Well the last month I've been trying to wean off and have gone from splitting the 4 mg to make 2mg, to buying 2mg and splitting them to make 1 mg. I stayed at 14 or so lozenge-halfs a day, but the dose was halved each time.

I'm down to about 4mg a day taken as 4 doses of 0.5mg. (that's a quarter of a 2mg lozenge) but I feel stuck even though I know this is the dosage at which they recommend jumping in the official guidelines. It's been so long since I've let myself feel and nicotine w/d.

I guess a need to hear a few opinions and gain perspective on my situation so that's why I decided to join the community. Where is my consumption at and what kind of CT will I have is what I'm wondering, if I can go 4 hours in between 1 mg lozenges I should be good right?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993991851806641}"

\*Not certain this is the correct sub-reddit but I assume plenty of ex-smokers frequent this one\*

I have been an extremely heavy daily smoker of both weed and tobacco (Only together, smoked cigarettes for the first 2 years) for the past 8 years or so only not smoking I'd say 30-40 days in total over that time.

I am 24 years of age with no other health issues whatsoever. Never been to the Doctors for anything bar when I was around 8 and had an elbow infection. I am pretty healthy as I rock climb very often but have not been able to for some months now due to the virus.

Since the lockdown I have quit both and have been 21 days clean now with no desire to smoke at all, even since the first day.

Over the past week my chest feels tight as if there were pains but I know lungs don't have pain receptors so it'll just be my chest being tight, just in that region, no spread just the chest. I am running 5K 3 times a week so I was thinking this may have a correlation.

My diet has completely changed, I wouldn't consider myself overweight but have some stomach fat, I'm around 6'2 and weigh about 12-13 stone. I don't think this will have any effect currently.

Some research online tells me that it's normal as it's around the time that my lungs are attempting to heal themselves and comparing it to a graze that has healed but makes the scab itchy but instead giving that chest tightness feeling.

Just to clarify, no shortness of breath or anything like that, purely just chest pain

Just wondering if anyone has gone through similar problems? I'll contact my Local GP if it persists but just for peace of mind currently I would like to know if anyone else has had this after quitting and how long it persisted for.

My mother was a long-time smoker. She smoked since I can remember. We tried to make her stop many times, but she never managed to do it. I would say that, on average, she smoked one box a day which is 20 cigarettes in Austria.

Then came the year 2016, where she got a lung disease. She had to take a sick leave, so I got really worried. The doctor presumed she had COPD, so she had to take an X-ray. It was a really painful wait till the doctor’s appointment came, but fortunately in the end she was told that it was ""just"" some minor sickness (I don't know exactly what it was). I was so relieved, and she promised me that this was the final nail in the coffin to make her stop.

Since then she never smoked in front of me and when asked, she pledged that she does not smoke anymore. I was never 100% sure about that as I every so often found suspicious hints, like lighters our home or odour in the hallway. But I had trust in her claims.

Fast forward a few years, I noticed odour in our organic waste bin just yesterday. I checked it and found a cigarette stub wrapped up in two paper towels, so she has deliberately hidden it. I was devastated but decided not to confront her yet. The next day when I saw her leaving the front door (supposedly putting the trash out), I immediately got wary. I sneaked out to check if she was smoking and indeed, I found her smoking in the hallway. She noticed me too and just said something along the lines of ""have you been following me?"". I said ""what in blazes are you doing?"" and got back. She now acts like as if this incident did not happen and I also don’t know what to do.

You can imagine that I'm disappointed and worried. I trusted her all this time, but now I'm pretty sure that she never really stopped smoking altogether (though I am quite certain that she smokes considerably less than before 2016, otherwise I would have spotted more hints).

I'm not sure how to proceed now. My mom is 56 already and she's not the fittest, so I am worried about her health. How should I confront her? Should I tell my father or keep it between us? I fear that there is no way to make her stop smoking eventually. She's hasn't much self-assertion and would most likely just be stubborn when confronting her about smoking. Also, as she's been hiding cigarettes all this time now, so I cannot even trust in what she tells me about it.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966765642166138}"

The patches are really nice. I started with 14mg. Every time before this attempt I would get really depressed. I decided I couldn’t do it alone and cold turkey wasn’t for me because I would take it out on all my friends and family. Going from 100 mg of nicotine daily (2 pods) to none is just too big of a drop. I got 14 mg patches because my friend told me even 21 mg made him sick. First few days were rough, but not as hard as before trying to just quit. I’m really confused on why people have a thing against hating on the patch (maybe it’s because juul doesn’t have the same chemicals has cigs)(maybe If you smoke cigs switch to vaping then do the patches). So far with each day I feel better and better. Eventually I grew to accept the patch as my only form of nicotine and at some point started to prefer it. 

Some advice I have for anybody who is thinking about using this method of quitting. Treat it as medication prescribed from your doctor. Follow the plan and order them online. This way you can read the reviews of which ones actually sticks onto you. I hear that is a huge problem. I naturally don’t sweat that much so it wasn’t that much of an issue. Also keep track of your bank account. $16 every 3-4 days really adds up. Feels nice having that money and spending it on things I actually need. Also write down a compelling why. Mine was to save more money up to buy a car, so far I’m up already by $32-46.

My father made a promise to quit cold turkey two weeks ago. We all thought he had actually quit.

After a while he went into his room, took his sweet time, and emerged with a lot of perfume.
Theres been a lot of perfume in the house lately..

He said i must have overheard him wrong
I said what about the perfume?
He said i just perfumed myself after showering

I let him leave.
And then i went to his room’s balcony, where i found numerous ashes and ashed spots in the plants, in the soil of the plants, and on the floor. 
Some of those ashes were still compact - unbroken pieces as big as a fingernail. 
It cant be from over two weeks ago... it cant be from someone else on the streets or up above...

What do i do?
Thus far he has just denied everything... Ash doesn’t just stay on the balcony, unbroken, from two weeks ago. Ash doesn’t just come into the balcony from passerbys. 
The abundance of perfume..

I would like the legal age to use tobacco and any nicotine-containing objects to be 25 years and older.
Many teenagers start buying and using nicotine-containing tobacco, cigars, and electric cigarettes, which is not healthy at all to consume nicotine at any age, but it is much worse when you start consuming this substance at as young an age as 18, than in many states it is the legal age to buy and consume tobacco. In the school where I study, many students smoke cigarettes, this is a problem because in addition to harming themselves, they also harm the people around them and the worst thing is that many students are minors. I would like this to settle as quickly as possible so that it is more difficult to obtain substances as harmful as nicotine.

Looking for some advice here. I am already really convinced I don't want to smoke, and its an addiction and not something I inherently enjoy. Never the less I continue smoking. I've been seeing my physician and she advises me to do certain behavior replacements things. But this in my mind works contradictory, it makes me think I do this so I won't do smoking, ending up not being able to think about anything else but smoking. The same goes for NTR, it makes me think, I am doing this so I won't smoke. So still the thought of smoking is in my head. 

In the past, I've quit(hard to say since I smoke again) a couple of times. The longest stretch was a couple of months. But this time it seems impossible to even make it a day. I've been thinking whats the cause of this. And I think the urgency of Corona in combination with my university work is the main problem. The times I quit successfully where during the easy semester on the uni, or during vacation. During these times I found behavior change easier since I could things which take really long and during which you won't smoke: running, biking, playing video games, swimming, yoga, going to the movies, etc. Now I get up, work out, do my uni work, eat, and sleep. There is no time to do a behavior adjustment involving activities that take a long time to complete. 

My last deadline is on the 24 of June. I am considering cutting down as much as possible until then but allowing myself to smoke when I can't focus. Since not smoking is interrupting my uni work, I can't think about anything else besides smoking, unless I smoke. So I end up not being productive at all until I just give in and allow myself to smoke. 

The advice is am asking for is: do you think it's a good idea to postpone trying to quit until this year of Uni is done, so I can really focus on quitting. During those times having a mind preoccupied with not something would not result in me wasting time I need for other important things. Furthermore, I would have a quit date that's far ahead and I could remind myself of it each and every single day. Now I try to quit each day and fail each day. 

I would love to hear some that are on this.

Hi Reddit,

So, today is 10 years to the day that I quit smoking.

I never thought I would see this day. I thought I would share my story with you. Maybe it may help motivate some of you trying to quit now.

I am a 42 year old guy.

I started smoking when I was 16, back in the mid-nineties. A lot more people smoked back in those days. My mum smoked, which I guess normalized it a bit, but I was dead against it as a kid.

So, teenage rebellion arrived, and I started hanging around with some other teenagers that smoked. It started off just lighting them for mates, then smoking at parties, then smoking during the day.

My parents lived just outside of town at the bottom of a big hill (about 1 mile long), and I used to ride my bicycle into town to see my mates. I used to be able to ride up the hill without stopping, but within a few months I found I couldn’t do it anymore, as my lungs burned too much. I had to get off and walk it.

Within a year, I gave up riding my bike entirely, as it was too much hard work – easier on the lungs to just walk.

So, life went on like this for a while. I did an apprenticeship, and spent the next few years partying and going to pubs/clubs, like youngsters do. (drinking age was 18 in the country I grew up in)

I tried quitting a few times, even managed a few months a couple of times, but soon slipped back into my old ways.

My addiction grew, and I was soon smoking 20 a day.

I moved out of home, now I could smoke in my own house too – this didn’t help me.

So, Jump forward another 10 years or so – I am 32. I am smoking 30 a day.

An average work day started something like:

Get up at 4:30am (work started at 6am). Kettle on, then a cigarette in my undies while kettle is boiling. Make a coffee. Second cigarette with coffee.

Have shower.

Have Breakfast.

3rd smoke.

30 min drive to work (2 smokes – 4 and 5)

Get to work.

2 smokes before my 6am shift starts – 6 & 7.

You get the idea - yes – I was addicted all right.

It got to the stage where I was starting to get needling pains in my heart every time I had a cigarette. Scared me shitless. They would go away after 3 hours or so, of course by then, I was craving for a smoke again. The cycle continues.

So, I lived with these pains for 2 or 3 weeks, and I got to doing some thinking.

I was 32 years old. I had been smoking for 16 years by now - half my life.

I wasn’t in a very well paid job at that time, and the boss wasn’t a very nice person. 

Smoking by this stage was costing me a lot of money. I had a 15 year old car that needed replacing, and I could certainly use the money I was spending on cigarettes.

I was single and lonely – being a stinky out of shape smoker was not helping my chances of meeting the right lady.

So, I thought to myself, ok, lets have a really big try this time. I’ll let myself eat whatever I want while I’m getting off the smokes, and If I can make it stick, then I promise that I will never ever ever ever ever touch a cigarette again.

So cold turkey, here we come.

And, somehow, all the planets aligned, and I made it stick.

I got fat (half a chocolate cake with custard every night will do that)

And I fell out with my boss, and found a much better paid job (smoking made me so lethargic, and I was sick of putting up with his shit when I was going through nicotine withdrawl.)

The chest pains went away.

I started saving money.

I bought a new (to me) car. 6 Years old, and low mileage – felt so modern compared to the old clunker I had before.

Life went on for a while. 3 months, then 6, and I stopped thinking about smoking completely. I have a motorcycle, and I started to notice I could smell people smoking out of their car windows, even when they were 3 or 4 cars ahead of me. Incredible how much it stuffs up your sense of smell!

So, now I am a fat, out of shape ex smoker.

A friend of mine was doing a fitness instructors course, and needed to train a class of 10 people of so for one of her assessments. She asked me to come along, which I dubiously did.

It was pretty much as bad as I thought it would be, wheezing, no stamina, could feel my back fat wobbling about whilst doing star jumps.

So, I thought I would see if I could start getting back in shape again.

I started training with my fitness instructor friend, and her husband.

We started cycling regularly, and progressed to running and a bit of circuit training – laps of a sports field, with push ups, sit ups etc in between.

I lost about 50 pounds, and my fitness went up.  I wasn't ultra muscly or anything, just a bit toned, and not fat anymore.

I did a couple of extreme events – Spartan etc. Did ok – in the top 30%. Enjoyed it, but I’ve never been ultra-competitive.

Turns out that it’s a good thing to be in shape in your mid/late 30’s, and I finally met the right lady, got married and had a Kid (who is now 2 years old).  I happily turned down a cigar on my wedding day, and again when my son was born.

So, I don’t have as much time as I used to now, but I still find time to train about 5 times a week – mainly cycling now, but I go through periods of jogging too. I put a little weight back on, but I am still well within the healthy weight range.

I try and make the cycling a lifestyle thing too and go places with the family at the weekend – I have a child carrier for the back, and my boy likes it on the back looking around.

So, here we are – 10 years off the cigarettes.  It’s funny, but everyone says that it’s all downhill from 40, but I am fitter at 42 than I was at 22. I guess it’s kind of sad thinking of all those wasted years, but that was a different period of my life. I can’t change it so best not to dwell on it.

I won't lie -  I can't relax like I used to, when I could sit on my arse, and chain smoke for hours, but I guess being more motivated is not a bad thing?

I hope this doesn’t sound like a brag, this wasn’t my intention. I just hope it can maybe motivate some of you to try/stick at it.

My 70 year old mother is now 18 months off the cigarettes after a health scare, which involved surgery – if she can do it, you can to.

After 15 years of smoking a pack a day (sometimes more) I quit cold turkey..it was completely unplanned...I just woke up one day and decided I was done....quitting was very hard for the first few weeks but it got easier the longer I went...Everyone who knows me was shocked that I quit and I had never been more proud of myself.....

At about the 2 month mark I started getting random cravings...after going weeks without even thinking about a cigarette suddenly I would be on the phone and get the urge to smoke...there were several times throughout the day where I started to feel like I was really missing something... 

One night I was having some drinks and  thought to myself ""one wont hurt""...I smoked 1 cigarette that night and wasn't proud of it but told myself ""it was just 1 and I am back on track now""...over the course of the next month everytime I would drink (so every weekend) I found myself having a cigarette (or 5)..I told myself ""well I only smoke when I drink..its better then how I used to be""... 

When quarantine hit I found myself craving a cigarette more then ever and I started to allow myself to have 1 when i was not drinking ""just in the evening to take the edge off""...within a week I was fulltime smoking again...once I started smoking again I felt TERRIBLE...headaches, a cough, dizzy spells, anxiety, heart palpitations.....I would feel so shitty that I would tell myself ""that's it!! That was my last cigarette"" ..and yet inevitably within a few hours I would be smoking another one...

Now that I am smoking again (urgh) I am smoking even more then I was before I quit!!!! (Its as if my addiction is trying to make up for lost time). 

Now I have to start all over again because I thought that I could handle ""just one""...obviously everyone is different...but im putting a PSA out there right now that ""just one"" is a very slippery slope!! Also - if you are someone who drinks alcohol regularly (like me) it is a good idea to have a contingency plan in place for when you are drinking and going to crave one - a vape, nicorette gum..whatever it is...do not have a cigarette!!! ..or better yet...abstain from alcohol for a very long time....2 months wasn't enough for me...

I carried the vape pod around with me just as I would have done with my cigarettes, but I soon noticed that I was leaving it on the side.

She used to smoke back in the day, but quit about a year ago. So it was easier for me to not smoke either and it was a nice evening, even if I had a lot of moments where I thought a smoke would be nice.

I had some drunk evenings with smoking friends since I quit, and those went fine, but I’m pretty sure if that friend had still been a smoker, yesterday I would have smoked as well. The moment just would have been too great in my mind, catching up and talking about old times over wine while smoking together. After she left, I was considering going out to buy a pack but just went to sleep instead.

I thought about this today and realized how a large part of whether you succeed in your quit, unless you either have iron willpower or really lose the desire for it, comes down to chance. It doesn’t even have to be about the large things in your life and personal tragedies, just small things like an evening out with an old friend. If that friend hadn’t quit a year ago, I might have smoked yesterday, which likely would have meant doing it today as well. And it doesn’t even have to be about people, it could be any situation you find yourself in. You can’t just avoid your life forever after you quit smoking, right?

Now this can be either a scary or a liberating realization. On the one hand, it means that that relapse is often just around the corner. On the other hand, it suggests that if you try and relapse a lot, it doesn’t have to mean that you’re a weaker person than the next one who has quit for years. It might just mean that other person has been lucky in their first few months to not run into one of these situations and then it stuck.

The first few days I had a goood handful of moments there where I felt like screaming or bursting into tears. But I stuck through and reminded myself that no matter how stressful my environment might be, or how loud that voice in the back of my mind telling me to smoke is; smoking won't make things better. It'll only give me a quick buzz and then I'll feel worse for having relapsed, and spiral all over again. 

About three days in I began to smoke some cannabis thinking that should help soften the cravings, and help me sleep (it was about 5am and I'd been up all night), only to realize that flakes of tobacco were mixed in with the weed, and I got buzzed.

I took it as a test. Like if I could get through all the stress of being shacked up at home, problems within the family, and then literally smoking tobacco, and still not smoke, I'd be in the clear. Yesterday evening I suddenly realized I had sent so much as thought about tobacco the entire day. About 10 days in now -not including the accidental smoke- I have my sense of smell back, tons more new energy, and most importantly, I'm content, rather than always wanting something more. 

Everybody thinks it's the physical withdrawals that get you, but really it's the psychological dependence. That's why so many smokers attempting to quit make it weeks or months or even years before they cave and fall right back into the trap. Once you truly get it through your head that there's literally nothing to gain from it but rather it is causing you to suffer, and that deep down you know you do not want to smoke, then you finally can let go of it.

First 2 days I used lozenges, they caused my throat to get so raw that it bled. So I dropped those and went cold turkey. First couple weeks were hell, and then it kind of just became telling myself no. Which I thought that was the end of it and I was like cool I can totally be a non smoker. 

Somewhere around the second month I think it was? I helped a friend fix their computer at their house. They smoke in side but they knew I quit so they aired it out and didn’t smoke while I was there. When I left, I left with a headache, and the next few days felt like I had just quit all over again. I strongly believe I absorbed nicotine through my skin lol. 

Fast forward to this week, as I type this it feels like I haven’t had a cigarette in like 3 or 4 hours. I’m suffering from that mental fog/confusion. I jumble my words as I type and forget how to spell simple words. My feet are fidgeting right now. I have mood swings that are down right scary. On Monday I was playing a video game(one that is in no way stressful). Out of no where I had immense cravings followed by primal rage. I threw my controller at my tv destroying the screen. I have never had any sort of out bursts like that. Yet when these cravings? flair up which is probably 40-50% of my day, I feel like I’m ready to spontaneously combust.

I started smoking when i was 14 and suicidal, and everything in my life is so much better now, i'm happier, in therapy and taking meds. None of the bad habits of my past life has been taken with me except smoking. And i always ask myself why is that? 

Right now its ramadhan so i have been smoking significantly less, only 3 a day from my usual 8 which has helped me to cut down. But this week i have been having serious chest pains due to severe heartburn, and even now i'm still smoking at least two a day?? even though it physically hurts.

 I don't know how many UK people are here but since the Govt is banning menthol ciggies on 20th of this month, i knew my days were numbered. I was mostly on the fence about stocking up (i cant smoke normal cigarettes, they always make me feel sick) but after tonight i know this pack is going to definitely be my last. 

Due to being visibly muslim with a scarf ( i try to treat it as a uniform and to act in a respectful manner in public) which means ending up in the most weirdest alleyways, secret gardens, really dangerous vacant places...all for one cigarette, it has honestly never made any sense. Greatest hits include both times a guy  has followed me, witnessing a drug deals, and overhearing people because i'm in the alleyway at 4am, like someone looking for a death wish.  

I guess i'm comforted by the fact that i cant physically buy them anymore, for a moment i was going to force myself to get the normal just to continue this disgusting habit but i am so tired. I am physically exhausted by this and i'm glad its over. I am obviously scared but my health issues will keep worsening. I haven't thought about my health ever but its better to start early. After this, and due to some serious weight gain (i havnt been swimming in months) i am really looking forward to excercising, and caring about myself.

I was a long term, rather heavy smoker. 

I'm going to try to treat this as a learning experience, so when I quit again in the near future, I'll be more prepared. 

On the plus side, I learned how to deal with some stressful situations without smoking. I broke out of a few smoking habits. I *hate* the taste! I really did feel healthier, and I don't like the feeling I get from smoking. I faltered a couple times in those 6 weeks, but I didn't fully surrender the quit until now. And I really didn't beat myself up over it. Not bullying myself over it was a really big step. 

The bad side: brain fog. It was so bad, I could barely get any work done. I'm taking an extension on a grad school course, because I got nothing done for the past 4 weeks.  The fog just wouldn't go away. Am I naturally that stupid? It's *horrible*!  

*I need my brain. I can't afford to be that out of it right now.* 

So, I really think that, for me, right now, I should use some sort of NRT. Probably gum. I know a lot of people might say, ""just fully quit nicotine,"" but I have too much to do. That brain fog can *seriously* screw up things in my life right now. It's not a good time. Yeah, I changed some habits, and I hope that continues. I want to get off smoking again as soon as possible. 

And when I quit again (Sunday? I can do Sunday...), I'm not going to keep track of how much I spend on gum. I bought some when I first quit, and I *really* didn't like watching ""money saved"" go into the negatives because I need a stopgap after 20 years of screwing up my health. Turns out, that's an unnecessary stressor.  I'm doing this for my health, and I'd rather focus on the health aspects than tracking money spent. 

Yes, I'm still addicted to nicotine. But it doesn't mean I have to smoke. I can afford to be long-term stupid a few weeks from now. Just don't fall all the way back.

I've been a smoker for about 4 years now(24M), with so many failed attempts at quitting. But about two weeks ago I felt this certain determination to cut back on this addiction. I was at one pack per day, and reduced it to two cigarettes over these days. Last night I felt like I was ready to quit altogether(with hopes of actually sticking with it this time), and while it's been less than 16 hours, I feel pretty good right now(in my last attempts I usually lost in the first day). But here is the thing, this morning I was informed of having to be somewhere at Saturday morning. I have to get there and wait for at least two hours with nothing to do, wandering in the streets until that work gets done. Over all these attempts, I've always given up over one of two things: anger and boredom. I feel like I have anger under control with some other methods, but even the thought of being idle for couple of hours on the outside is making me kinda nervous. Do you have any kind of advice on how to deal with that?(up until now my plan was to simply enjoy my time inside due to the quarantine and avoid being idle, but this thing has to be done at Saturday and there's no way I could cancel it)

P.S: I don't want to postpone it anymore, because I feel like it will reduce my willpower, not to mention that boredom and anger can never be completely avoided, so I think it's better to find a way to deal with them right from the start.",5,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9963744282722473}"

I'm just about to hit 4 days mark in a few minutes. I quit 4 days ago after having read the book. Wasn't planning to stop at all and didn't really want to, read more out of curiosity. 

I'm super happy and proud to not be smoking and I know that if I smoked again right now, cigarettes would taste disgusting and it would take a good moment for me to be able to enjoy them again. 

However, I'm finding it difficult to cope woth some symptoms. It feels like after the hour 48 I've been on an emotional rollercoaster, I feel like I get irritated super easily and I find myself being super direct, bold and bitchy some moments. Also, probably the biggest thing for me is that I'm feeling dizzy (almost like high) and nauseous all the time, I can't stand feeling like I'm about to throw up 24/7. 

I've told a couple of my friends (they're smokers) that I've quit and they say that there's no physical effects after quitting and everything is in your mind so they're just making me feel like a crazy person. They keep telling me that the withdrawal doesn't affect them cause sometimes they go two three+ days without smoking (and then binge 10 cigarettes in an evening). When I tell them that I'm super excited to see the difference in exercising before and in several days, they tell me that there isn't really gonna be that much difference. It kinda makes me feel shit cause I wasn't able to be just a social smoker and I admitted that I was super addicted, and they just bring my excitement down cause ""it's not that big of a deal"". I know I shouldn't be bothered about what they say but that plus being all over the place with my emotions and feeling nauseous all the time kinda make me want to start again and come back to quitting later. 

I think this time is especially stressful for many of us and I unfortunately have to deal with some legal issues with my employer. Even with this I don't genuinely feel like smoking but I'm afraid that I'll either tell them something really mean or start crying on the phone. So maybe I should just quit again during ""easier"" times...

I'd be so grateful for any advice and let me know if anyone is going through the same, we can support each other :)

Edit: Has anyone felt nauseous all day every day after quitting to and how did you deal with this?!?! It's really making me nuts!

Gonna be 30 in a week (5/20) and has decided it is gonna be my quit day. I have previously quit multiple times and the longest I have gone without smoking was 6 months. Was gonna quit when I turned 25 but that came and went and stresses of life at the time just didn't make it seem possible to quit. However, things are going much better for me and I have decided I spent way too much money and have smelled way too bad for too long. I have gone down from smoking a pack a day to half a pack. A fresh pack opened in the morning would be gone by the end of the day.

I have been making a conscious effort to not smoke when I got a craving and have at least an hour in between cigarettes. A fresh pack opened in the morning now lasts until the end of the next day.

Right now it is little past 6 PM and I have 4 and a half cigarettes. That is one thing I have also been doing. Smoke only half a cigarette and convince myself that I am satisfied. Seems to work sometimes and I can go an hour to two but sometimes it doesn't and I have the other half lit in 10 minutes.

Anyways, I am planning on switching to nicotine patches starting tomorrow. I have half a box of nicotine patches worth 7 days. Bought it couple months ago trying to switch to it. Went a week without smoking and it felt great but bummed a smoke from a friend and just kept smoking so I stopped using the patch.

So my game plan is this:

1. Ween down to less cigarettes a day (20 to 10. I think I accomplished this)
2. Get on the patch for a week while getting rid of triggers and smell of smoke without getting cravings (The patch definitely helps and with reduced nicotine intake right now, I think it will be more effective at killing the cravings)
3. Go cold turkey on my quit day but depending on how it feels, i might get more patches but definitely not cigarettes.

TLDR; gonna quit smoking with a hodge podge method of weening myself and then getting on patches and then possibly cold turkey in a short period.

PS, different time, different country, different culture. I could walk into a bar and order beer when I was 13 and nobody would bat an eye.

I've thought about trying to at least reduce to cigarettes I really want, but I know it's not going to work, specially because with that mindset I can make any cigarette a really wanted cigarette. Another reason is that I enjoy very much an occasional cigar. I have a cigar maybe one every two months, and that I find really enjoyable.

Cigs>vape>lozenges.,"I'm 28 and have smoked for 12 years. I've made a few attempts at quitting, longest being 6 months. I missed cigarettes every second of that until I eventually gave in. 

I eventually tried vaping. I really enjoyed it and had no real intention of quitting my vape. It kept me off the cigs for 2 years. Until one day, I was running late and left my vape at home. 

I didn't want to smoke, or buy a new vape, or go home and get my vape. So I picked up some nicotine lozenges. 

After having used the vape for a while, switching to lozenges is really no big deal... I actually preferred getting my nicotine that way. More convenient. Less showy. People congratulate you for moving from a vape to lozenges. And it's really no big deal. Your body doesn't really care where your nicotine comes from. 

Just used them, 12 weeks as advised. I found that I naturally used less and less without really thinking about it until I hit the point I'd done a few days of just 1 lozenge a day. 

At that point... Might as well quit. Seems so easy now. 

1st 3 days, withdrawal was uncomfortable. But I want tempted to cave as I'd not smoked or Vaped in so long, and lozenges are so unrewarding. 

Day 4 withdrawal is calming, day 5 has been fairly minor in the way of cravings. 

I'm 5 days nicotine free, 12 weeks vape free, 2 years smoke free.

A bit of background: I've been hanging out with my roommate a lot during quarantine. He smokes, or at least he did until yesterday. Last Sunday we had been drinking a lot and I was interested so he gave me a cigarette. Tuesday morning I bought him more because he ran out and he had been nice enough to give me one. We got drunk again Tuesday night, and I had one of the ones I had bought him. It felt really good and relaxing, and I've been stressed a lot lately.

\*I should note that my roommate had told me repeatedly by this point that I shouldn't take up smoking. He gave me one, but that was it.

Wednesday and Thursday were stressful as I was working on a big project for work that was time-sensitive. Wednesday night, I went out and bought my own pack (without my roommate knowing) and smoked a few that night. Thursday I spent all day working on the project, and then smoked a few cigarettes after my roommate was asleep (also, both nights I had been drinking as well). I started thinking it was a bad idea because I didn't want to get addicted, so I left my pack out for my roommate to find with a note saying he should take them from me (I didn't want to throw them away in case I changed my mind - I don't have a lot of money to waste).

My roommate took the cigarettes from me. Friday morning I finished the project so that afternoon we started drinking to celebrate. Eventually my roommate wanted to smoke, and he felt bad doing it without me so he gave me one. We ended up smoking the rest of the pack I had given him that day. In the evening I made a trip to the liquor store, and before I left I asked him how many cigarettes we had left. He said plenty, but I was sure he was trying to get me to stop so I bought another pack anyway. Turns out I was right, we had finished the pack, so I started on my new one.

I had decided to smoke only when drinking or before bed, but Saturday I had my first cigarette while sober in the middle of the day. I didn't like it near as much, but I still went out an hour later to have another. I was scared I was getting addicted, so I went and bought nicotine lozenges. I had one and didn't think about smoking for 3 hours. I thought, cool, I can use these so I don't smoke so much, and then when I'm feeling less stressed I can actually stop.

Then yesterday (Sunday) my roommate decided he was going to stop smoking for Mother's Day. I thought if he's going to stop completely then maybe I should too, that way if it's difficult I can have help. So I tried to quit. But the lozenges didn't work very well (I had one every 1-2 hours), I spent the whole day unable to focus or sit still, going back and forth from thinking it's too hard to quit so I shouldn't and then feeling like a piece of crap.

What made everything worse is that even though my roommate has smoked for much longer than I have, he was handling it much better. That just made me feel even more useless, I could barely go a few hours without going crazy and there he was just taking it in stride. That evening I asked him why it's easier for him. He said he doesn't know because I just started and shouldn't be addicted yet. He said it might be the stress and anxiety of our situation playing a role, but I was acting like I was really hooked and I shouldn't even be addicted yet because I hadn't been doing it for long enough.

That confused me, because it definitely felt like I needed cigarettes all day yesterday. And this morning as well, I'm trying to ignore it, but I feel kind of trembly, anxious, and irritable and I want to smoke again. Is it all in my head? Is it possible to get addicted after only a few days, in which time I smoked a little more than a pack? Or is it something else that I'm attributing to cigarettes?",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.994619607925415}"

I find I can quit for a day or two with little issues when it's my day off. But the moment I have to work again I can't fathom not smoking. I work with my dad and am usually stuck in the work truck with him for 8-10+ hours a day. And he's the most insufferable person I know. I disagree with every word that comes out of his mouth and he just gets under my skin with every shitty opinion he spews out. He complains about literally everything he sees.  I'm not being hyperbolic. The man never stops bitching and moaning. And it's always about the same things day in day out. Trying to tune him out and stair out the window while chain smoking is the only way I get through the day. I have long since given up trying to educate him, as he just becomes super defensive/mad and continues on with his shitty opinions. 

For reasons I won't go into, I don't have the option to not work with him. My only hope is in the fall him retiring. But I know he won't because he has been saying it for the last four years. And the man literally knows nothing in life but working himself to death. So I don't see this time being any different. 

My breathing is getting so bad though. If I walk around or wait in line at a convenience store too long I lose my breath. To the point I can start gasping for air as I feel like I can't get enough oxygen. It literally feels like I'm suffocating. Despite this horrific feeling, 5-10 minutes later I'm back to puffing away. 

I'm on an antidepressant that's supposed to also be prescribed to help quit smoking. Blanking on the name atm. But it does nothing for me. Been over a year now. I tried vaping, but it somehow made everything feel worse. I would cough uncontrollabley every other puff. And each inhale made my lungs hurt. I have tried like 4 or 5 different shops and vape sticks but they all seem to do the same. I want to try the patches but I can't afford them. 

So ya, idk. I just woke up this morning itching for a smoke. I only have 2 left and know I'm going to have to reload before I start the day. My father is a huge trigger for me smoking and there's no way to avoid him. But even if I could I know I would still keep going back. I have quit for weeks or a month at a time when I could be alone with nothing to do. But it never sticks. Been close to ten years now of smoking a pack a day.

Half way through the book, the cigarettes started feeling pretty disgusting and I for a moment I felt like I was gonna throw up. I rolled all the remaining tobacco I had (5 cigarettes worth) when I was 2/3 through the book and kept smoking. I left the last cigarette for when I'd finish reading. I had moments when I felt like I was about to cry because probably from page 60 I knew I was gonna sit there until I finish the book and quit that same day. I had my last cigarette around 3 am and it felt like it was burning my throat. I knew it was the last one, at least for a while.

Today, I've already been awake for around 9 hours. I woke up with my lungs feeling like shit (it wasn't because of the amount of cigarettes I had smoked before going to bed, I'd normally chain smoke 3-4-5 + cigarettes - in fact, I'd never go outside to only smoke one, it would always be at least two - so my body was used to it, or I was used to constantly having breathing difficulties. I think it's the first time I'm admitting to myself that I feel like crap in the morning because of smoking and not because I had fallen asleep with an open window or I'm having an allergic reaction. On the other hand, I felt super excited, I tried to take some deep breaths, through my mouth and through my nose, and I savoured the moment because I knew that fucking exciting times are coming, in a few days/weeks I'll see what it's like to be able to wake up without feeling like I'm having an asthma attack.

I spent the entire day cooking and doing deep cleaning in my room. And not because I felt like I need to do something to distract myself from wanting to smoke, I was just excited because it's kind of a new beginning. Also, I felt less or not at all lethargic comparing to my regular days. I made a trip to supermarket, normally I'd be smoking on the way there and back, so I was a little worried. Surprisingly, I didn't even think about smoking. I think I caught myself twice during the entire day thinking for a split second ""gonna go outside now"" but I quickly realized that it's not really me wanting to smoke, it's just my habit of going outside all the time. I bought some junk food, just in case. Didn't touch it, didn't even think about it.

It's been a good day and I'm so excited to be able to start feeling the benefits of being a non-smoker. I know that probably today it's easy for me because it's something new and I'm thrilled. I understand that tomorrow and few days after may be more difficult. If I have doubts in the future, I hope I can look back at this post and get inspired again.

To those who are debating whether to read the book, just fucking read it. I never thought of quitting before yesterday and I quit that same day. Good luck to everyone!

There's no real feeling of accomplishment for having made it this far - maybe because I never had the 'hell week' in the beginning, I don't know.

I have ups and downs but most of the time it feels like I'm not ready and I'm just waiting for the moment where I relapse. I'm in this weird situation where I don't think that I'll stay quit but I also don't want to feel like I'm throwing away what I've done so far and just smoke.

You know how there are dry alcoholics, people who don't drink but haven't really beaten the addiction? I feel like that's what's happening to me with smoking.

Today I visited my mom for Mother's Day and she said she has rarely seen me as apathetic as I have been over the past weeks. She believes I should make either the decision to stay quit or the decision to smoke, but I have to make a decision and it has to be mine. I can't stay in this space where I feel like I'm powerless over what's happening to me. I think she's right, but I don't feel like I can commit to quitting and making the decision to smoke feels like giving up.

I really don't like normal cigarettes and only smoke them when I'm out drinking in a pub and there are no other options. But no pubs open here till August, so I guess that will put a stop to that plan also!

Can't believe I managed to not smoke for a week, wasn't easy tbh but I need some advice. I managed to identify the main situations that make me crave a cigarette the most:

1. Work break: Usually after a couple hours of work, I used to go outside and smoke a cigarette. Now I'm like, yeah a break, ok, but what do I do during this break ?
2. Waiting for something: Either waiting for someone, waiting for a taxi or anything, I used to smoke a cigarette but now it feels that waiting for anything really sucks.
3. Boredom: like when I get bored, I used to just light a cigarette to pass the time. It kinda seems time goes slower now.
4. Socializing: Living in a place where most people are smokers, whenever I talk to someone (friend or stranger), we'd always talk around a cigarette. Now it feels kind of impossible to talk to someone unless you got a smoke.

I (29M) smoke half weed, half tobacco. Can this sub help? 

4 years of university I smoked every morning . 2 years working for an investment fund, I still smoked every morning. Then I moved to Prague for 2 years, smoked everyday . 

I met a perfect girl who doesn't approve of smoking. I agree with her and love her for it. Wanted to quit before I met her and this was a great push. 

It was manageable to stop. A week of no sleep, lots of sweat, being grumpy and (the worst) depression. But I suddenly clean and feeling good. 

5 months later, at party, offered joint... You know the story.  

After that I smoked behind her back for 2 months  before taking up a job in Hong Kong. 

We decided long distance for a year because she was offered a promotion at the same time. I smoked everyday in Hong Kong. 

Finally, a year later she moved to Hong Kong and I quit again. Same story, a few sleepless nights, sweating, grumpy, depression. 

Months and months of being clean. Lost 15kg, got healthy, and was active. Enjoying ourselves. 

Random joint at a beach party, I think. You guys know the story. 

Now I've smoked for months behind her back and this time is the hardest to quit.

It's not fair at all and the guilt is building up. Today I ruined a perfect day on the beach because of some emotional bullshit that I knew was from a mini withdrawal.  

She adores me and I genuinely treat her well but I have this secret. She could never imagine the father of her children, smoking weed and I love and respect her for that. I couldn't imagine the mother of my child getting high (the irony) so I know this secret would end us. Rightly so. 

Why is it so hard to stop this time, I know it's just a week of mini-hell and then my life will be exponentially better. I've felt it, lived it.

I got promoted 3 days ago to a job I actually want (my jobs not hard or stressful anyway) during this fucked up Covid time when we should just be grateful to be alive. So why did I just travel an hour to a dealer, then an hour home to get high alone on a roof, and then have a fucking crying breakdown for 2 hours in a random park.

Everything was so overwhelming which is a bullshit reason but it got to me somehow. I’ve been romanticizing smoking for 3 weeks or so and yesterday I broke.

The first one was actually not good. The filter tasted really awful and sucking smoke through it felt like a foreign thing. I was at my parents house and bummed on of my brother. Then I wanted another an hour later so I got a full pack. Then I tried to smoke in this romanticized way again. I knew it was bad and it tasted wrong but it felt as I traveled back through time. Another again later. After each cigarette I felt more guilty, but the nicotine kept me going I guess. After that I met some friends and I smoked almost the whole pack, deliberately at the end, two cigs in a row, to absolutely disgust myself not to do it again.  Then I threw away the rest of the pack and tore all the cigarettes.

I’m optimistic it’s a one time slip and I don’t have to fall of the nicotine wagon again, I don’t have to make myself a slave, all I have to do is not smoke. And that feels like a relief. But I feel the monster gnawing the day after. It’s like I have a bad hangover. That’s what is getting to me from not smoking: there is such a divide in me.

So I have decided to go cold turkey tomorrow and force myself to stop.

 The one big problem I am seeing is that both my brother and mom smoke and we are currently always home due to the present situation. Its hard because they never seem to be too supportive on helping me stop. On top of things like constant bickering because everyone is getting sick of each other. 

I play a decent amount of video games and my computer is set up in the basement, which is where my brother usually smokes. I'm afraid those triggers and then the triggers from my mom smoking upstairs will lead me back into wanting to do it as I have no where in my house besides my bedroom to lock myself away right now. 

I do really enjoy being active as well as cooking so I'm hoping I can use those as vices but there are no gyms open so am mainly stuck doing this around the house.  (Bothers me how much smoking has been killing my endurance.)

I'm probably some kind of covert narcissist, but one with empathy, in fact I consider myself as having too much empathy for everyone, except for narcissists or assholes, or maybe I'm the opposite of a narcissist, don't know, I meet all the criteria for everything to be honest.

By the way, I've been coping with negative emotions like rejection, and lack of admiration with cigarettes for at least 15 years. So now everytime I quit, I find myself with these enhanced emotions (both positive and negative), but the negative ones are relatively new to me in intensity, and I usually end up talking myself to smoke another last cigarette which then ends up being the first of a new series.

For the last 4 years it has been going on like this, throwing away hundreds of cigarette packs, just to buy a new one after a few hours. If I manage to go 2 days without them I'm in the safe zone, but then the insomnia starts kicking in. 

Now I'm at least aware of my problem, but how do I cope with this whole set of negative emotions now?

I've been smoking since 18 years old, I'm 23 now and never tried quitting before. I was prepared to keep smoking until they throw dirt on me.

The whole COVID madness emerged right after I came back from a week long visit to my friends in Amsterdam. First day I came back to work after vacation they immediately sent me home for a mandatory 2 weeks of self isolation. Needless to say the whole situation was kinda scary and confusing. Then I watched the Joe Rogan podcast where he had a scientist talk about coronavirus and the guy said something about 80% of Chinese casualties over age 65 are males and there is good chance it's linked to the smoking culture within Chinese males. Well that spooked me good. 

Also I kinda grew tired of something controlling me. There would be times when I didn't even want  
 to smoke, but it was 10am at work, the coffee mug was already empty so I HAD to go along with the schedule and light one up. Then there's the underlying feeling of always doing something harmful to yourself and knowing it, but doing it anyway.

Not gonna lie, the first 2-3 weeks were a bit rough. My anxiety got worse, had trouble sleeping and focusing. But overall it wasn't as bad as I expected :) 

I still get cravings from time to time, but definitely the best positive I can take away from this is the fact that I was able to do something I never though I could. I found a confidence in me that was not there before. I am planning to start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu - something I was always scared to do but wanted to, I am sure I will be able to eventually learn how to swim too. Both of these things seemed like they would only be possible if I was to somehow become a better version of myself, but that didn't seem very realistic. By quitting I showed myself that with enough determination I can achieve something that previously seemed impossible.

I am well aware that many people relapse and I definitely don't feel immune to it, but at least today I believe I would still be mindful enough to eventually stop if that ever happens.

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience and I guess slightly tap myself on the shoulder as well. Hope someone can relate and maybe even get inspired to quit as well.

  
Best of luck

Wayne Coyne, the singer of the Flaming Lips said in an interview ‘I quit smoking when I was 30. In my 20s I was waiting for life to start. I was in this band that wasn’t selling records yet, I was always on the road...’ 

I associate smoking with the fun activities in my 20s that catch up with anyone as they get less energy and it becomes very undignified to do as an adult. Things like casually dating a lot or thinking you should experience with drugs or wanting to listen to an album by a cool young band or rock group.

For me, quitting smoking is as the phrase goes ‘act you’re age not your shoe size’*

What I dislike about quit smoking culture is this ridiculously over positive attitude like you’ve quit heroin or crack or crystal meth.

I sat there and smoked, watched the tent. heard the rustle of her bedding and quickly put the cigarette out, dashed to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. I put on a patch and joined reddit. I have asthma. I feel such huge shame about smoking. My mum has copd and is shielding- she finds stairs hard work. This time I need to make it work. I was nicotine free for a few weeks at lockdown after 3 months on patches. But I caved in after drinking. I don’t really drink anymore as it gives me anxiety. It’s so easy to fall back to it. My partner smokes- a lot. I feel like smoking is ‘what we do’. I don’t think he wants to change despite laboured breathing and living a life that makes sure smoking is possible. My daughter caught me once and it was the worst thing ever. She was disgusted. I spent my childhood being disgusted at my parents. It’s like a bad family secret... I just pass it on.

I tried again but it makes me so sick I can’t get past a few days on it. I’ve watched loved ones die miserably due to smoking. Nothing seems to work. 

So now I switched to Juul 3 days ago. To be honest I love it. I like that I don’t stink, there’s no trash or ash. My mouth isn’t gross. I don’t even think about cigarettes, only how nasty they taste. My car doesn’t smell. 

I know Juul isn’t the best replacement. Honestly I’d love to be done with everything all together but this seems to be a good option for me. For now. It’s cheaper too. My plan is to go 3 months on 5mg then switch to 3mg for 3 more months and then quit all together. Hopefully by then the cigarettes will be a distant memory.

You can suffer with waves of anxiety and depression for a few years after you quit. That doesn’t mean you have an anxiety disorder or a depression disorder. It’s normal. Completely normal.

Since the lockdown began, I have went out for shopping three times. And each time I bought 10-15 cigarette packs to make sure I would not be out of cigs for at least 2 weeks.

But because of some reasons around 17 days back, I ran out of cigarettes. The fact that my fingernails were turning dark brown and recently my gums were bleeding when I used to brush my teeth, I decided to take a break.

Something that I thought was a part of my personality or who I am is my inability to wake up early in the morning. I have been a night owl for as long as I can remember. In fact sometimes I feel I have insomnia. It has been my habit to be the last person to reach office. But employers didn't use to care since I was quite productive.

Coming back to the topic. Once I ran out of cigs I decided to take a break. And just 2-3 days after not smoking I realized that I was feeling really really sleepy around 10-11pm. I'm the guy who doesn't feel sleepy even at 5-6 in the morning.

I was wondering why this was the case, but then it 'hit' me (pun intended). It was because I was not smoking. Smoking so many cigarettes every day had destroyed my sleep cycles, routine and ability to sleep on time. I could never watch the rising sun, I didn't know what it felt like to consistently wake up early in the morning.

[And since then I haven't smoked.](https://i.imgur.com/qXoF6TO.jpg) I must say I love this feeling. 

\-I feel energetic.

\-I sleep early and I wake up early. The feeling of doing things on time is so positive.

\-I don't have to feel embarressed or guilty for starting work later than my colleagues. 

\-My fingernails are looking much much better. 

\-My gums are not bleeding. 

\-My room is cleaner and it is easier to clean it since there is no ash around.

\-I saved around 50USD so far (in my country) that I can spend elsewhere

\-Other postive effects that we all know about

First time posting here looking for some. Opinions 
Tobacco has been banned in my country due to Covid regulations so I've made the decision to start the process of quitting

I'm 22 years old and I've been smoking semi heavily (I think at least) for about 4 years. In the last 2 years I'd say I averaged around 10-18 cigarettes a day

Recently I've been cutting down heavily, going from the above mentioned to around 2-5 a day, all at night time

A few days ago I had a small relapse and had 8 due to a stressful day and ever since I've been very short of breath

I try to take deep breaths but it feels like my lungs just stop before I get a satisfactory amount of air. I also am having these strange semi yawns where my mouth stretches as if it wants to yawn but it never comes

I get enough air to function so I don't feel it's threatening but it's extremely frustrating and causing me stress and anxiety which is wanting me to smoke more to stop the stress

Last year, I started a journey to break various bad habits (sleeping late, smoking, no soda) utilizing neuroscience protocols. The data from that social experiment highlighted the importance of finding a ‘trigger’ and connecting to the network of like-minded people. We know that all habits have specific triggers and removing them with something positive is the key.

My issue was sleeping late. The trigger was my phone and YouTube. To solve this trigger, I moved the power outlet, charger, and phone to the living room and turned it off before going to bed. This decision was “super effective”.

A friend of mine went through a similar trial. She wanted to stop smoking, but she kept taking a blunt on her way home after work, at a specific location. The trigger was a physical location that initiated smoking for whatever reason. So, I advised her to use a different path and purchase some vitamin water as a reward. Recently, I haven’t seen her take a puff since.

This trigger protocol worked great, but it was extremely difficult to help hundreds of strangers through advice and YouTube videos. That’s why, as some of you already know, I teamed up with a group of scientists and developers to make a useful tool. Our plan was to create a neuroscience-based habit platform where you can find like-minded people and solutions and apply scientific protocols to break bad habits.

We released an early version and got your feedback. The app had many holes and many features were lacking. But the data was in. With your help, the devs were able to launch an official version a couple days ago!

**Here’s the** \*\*upgrade (\*\*but not limited to):

* 3 main neuroscience protocols embedded into the app
   * [RAS](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/if-you-want-it-you-might-get-it-the-reticular-activating-system-explained-761b6ac14e53)
   * [Habit loop](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/)
      * [How  rewards stimulates a specific part of the brain in half a second](https://neurosciencenews.com/habits-brain-15805/)
   * Social win
* A fresh tutorial
* Triggers and real-life Solutions
* New feed system to see other users’ Triggers and Solutions
* Bad habit category to choose from
* More reward for daily and weekly engagements
* Free brain hacks every week or two via email
* Improved user experience and interface
* Faster performance
* Smarter push notifications

**Future plans**

* Tinder for habit (Find your habit match 😘)
* Group challenges to participate and win
* 1 on 1 with behavioral scientists & neuroscientists
* Monetary compensation for helping others
* More types of data (voice memos, gifs, videos)
* Blockchain
* And more...

Unfortunately, an **Android** version isn’t available(yet). But we have one in the pipeline. We want to perfect the IOS version first before launching on Android. So keep in touch with us for **updates** by signing up at our web site: [https://www.braintingle.io/](https://www.braintingle.io/)

Never had major cravings and while the first few days did suck, they were pretty easy to get through reminding myself that those days would be the worst and everything after that would be comparatively easy.

I don’t find that to be the case though. Yes, I‘m more used to not smoking by now, but I’m finding it really hard to stay motivated. Judging from how I felt for this whole month, my physical dependence was close to zero but the psychological pull was and is pretty strong. I keep bargaining with myself every day about how starting again wouldn’t be the worst thing and I can quit at some other point (yes, I know, the addiction talking and so on). I still see myself as a smoker who’s currently not smoking. I don’t tell people I quit, I tell them that I haven’t smoked in x days. I romanticize smoking and I miss it. In most situations, at some point the thought of smoking arises. Not like a fix that I need immediately, but more like this thing that has kept me company for so long and that I‘m now forcing myself to say goodbye to together with a part of my personality. I realize that this might sound melodramatic - it even does to me - but that’s what it feels like.

I don’t think this is going to go away by just waiting. In my head, smoking is still a nice thing that I have to keep myself from doing. Yes, I know all the Allen Carr arguments and I find many of them to be pretty simplistic. I don’t work well with the „here’s a book, treat it as a bible“ method. It feels like I’m not ready to let go yet and while I can absolutely realistically keep going without smoking, the fact that I miss it won’t change just like that, I think.

Now I’m in this position where I can either smoke again and feel shitty for giving up or keep on going and feel the way I feel now, which isn’t unbearable but it sucks.

Not sure if I’m looking for advice or just trying to vent but I would appreciate any comments nonetheless.

Here’s the thing, May 1st was supposed to be the start of a new me. No more smoking, starting last Friday. I’ve been smoking since June 2011, and I honestly can say that not a day passed by where I didn’t light up at least two or three cigarettes since then. Even when I had the flu and a 40°C/104°F fever, I still went up and lit up a cigarette or two on my balcony (or course worsening the cold or whatever I had, but that’s another story). For the last two years, I was at about 2-3 packs during the week, and 2 packs during the weekend. All in all, I was smoking around 5 packs a weeks, sometimes even 6. At 7 EUR a pack, I was spending around 1.800-2.000 EUR per year in cigarettes.

So, May 1st, big date. I was a bit afraid of the task. To ease the pain, so to speak, I decided for the last two days not to smoke during the day anymore, only in the evening around dinner. April 29 and April 30 will go down as two of most cranky days I ever spent in my life, being angry all the time, everything and everyone getting on my nerves, be it the smallest things. It didn’t start well...

May 1st came, and it actually went quite well. No office routine where I would light up the first smoke while leaving the house, no morning break at around 10/11, no pre-lunch or post-lunch cig, nothing to temp me too much. On Monday, this morning, I went for a run. Even when I was smoking, I was always able to run my 10k in around 50-55 min, and I even did an Olympic triathlon a few years ago, finishing at around 3hrs, despite still smoking the usual amount. Smoking didn’t really seem to make a difference to me. This morning, I was able without much effort, to clock my 10k in 48min. I was quite proud of myself, thinking that the smoke free days I just passed might have something to do with it.

Then came the craving. One cigarette I loved was the one right after exercising. When you’re still pumped up, right before taking a shower, waiting to cool down. Sitting on my balcony, overlooking the street, the morning sunlight hitting me while I’m sitting at my small table, I was so tempted, I lit up a smoke. I cracked after only 3 days without any cigarette.

Not only did I hate myself for that, I also hated the cigarette while I was smoking it. Not that disliked the taste - I loved it actually - I hated the fact that this cigarette I ćraved so much did in no way fulfil my expectations. On my “Smoke Free” app, I did admit that I smoked one, and I decided that I wouldn’t see this as a failure. Just a minor setback in my attempt to get rid of it. I realised that I did already come a (short) long way, and I would need to think about that one cigarette that disappointed me the next time I would have a craving.

It’s all quite new to me, trying to stop this expensive, unhealthy habit of mine, that is so deeply rooted into my daily routine, so I would like to ask for your honest and brutal opinion:

- am I downplaying the failure to stop smoking, incorrectly picturing it as just a minor hiccup on my way to a smoke free self, or should I take it more seriously that I cracked and lit up a smoke after my morning run?

- what do you do, when facing a particular craving for this one cigarette you used to love? I understand there are a lot of successful ex-smokers in this sub, would love to hear their take on this...

- looking forward, how do you cope with all these hurdles that will get in your way, do take them one by one as they come, the big picture (a lifetime without cigarettes...) being too big to be focused on?

This is one of the longest texts I’ve written in a while, and I hope I didn’t bore you to death with my story, but I do hope that some of you guys will have had the courage to read everything through until the end, and maybe help me...

Thanks a lot for your help and your insights, looking forward to hearing back from you guys.

I am just posting this to vent and perhaps get any response that might make me feel a bit better.

I am 6 weeks smoke free, after being a heavy smoker for 20 years. Around the 3 week mark I lit one up, had 2 puffs and threw it away. I didn't enjoy the taste and I didn't enjoy the buzz either.  My cravings are few and not super strong. I actually feel that in order to relapse, I will need to do some effort (i.e. power through the initial bad taste and nausea) until I can get back to enjoying smoking.

However I can't shake the feeling, since the start of the quit, that I am very unhappy with my decision to quit smoking. 

I have made other difficult decisions in my life that required some willpower to power through them: 1) Giving up soda drinks (I really enjoyed them and had a coke with every meal) 2) Giving up fast food 3) Breaking up from a 7 year long but toxic relationship. 4) Have a work out regime and stick to it with no ""missed days""

All of the above required some will power to not ""relapse"", but at any point during the ""quit"" I could consciously ""feel"" that I was making a good decision, I was proud of myself and had this optimistic feeling for the future.

But in the case of smoking, I don't feel proud at all, I don't feel happy at all. I want to go back to the day I quit and convince my self not to do it. 

I feel like I am trapped, I don't feel any better or happier, but I know that relapsing will make feel terrible. So I am stuck in a gridlock, smoke-free but un-happy...",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981867671012878}"

Background - 29 years old and had been smoking since I was 16. Even more so when I drank, which is unfortunately a lot. But I digress, heavy smoker that had failed numerous times previously in trying to quit. 

This time, I found giving myself a set date was imperative. Previously, it was always “I need to stop,” or, “next weekend,” every weekend. I never had a foundational goal and this time I needed to approach it differently. January 23rd was my set date. Cold turkey would be my method.

The first few days were obviously tough and I immediately had those procrastinating thoughts lingering back into my head. I considered getting patches or gum to take the edge off from the crave, but I hadn’t had luck with them previously. I know you are to wean yourself off by lowering the dosage with nicotine patches or gum, but it just feels counterproductive to ingest nicotine when trying to break a nicotine addiction. 

Additionally, I downloaded the Smoke Free app from the iOS App Store. This was easily the greatest assistance to quitting. It has many resources, shows health improvements, you can even live chat with a cessation experts, and more. 

While having a tough day with cravings and irritability about 4 days in, I decided to try the chat, and was connected to an expert named Susan. In our discussions, she mentioned that the 100 day mark is significant milestone as the nicotine receptors have died off and cravings are essentially gone. Hearing this on day 4, while it was discouraging, it helped to motivate me to continue onward. I pulled up my calendar, went to May 2nd, and entered “100 Days Nicotine Free.”

Yesterday, I got the notification. 

At this point, it isn’t even difficult to not smoke anymore. I can be intoxicated around smokers and don’t even consider a puff. It’s a wonderful, and at one point a seemingly impossible, feeling, and I hope everyone eager to quit can use some of this advice to be successful as well. Cheers.

So I thought I would make some adjustments to the hypnosis and make it a general recording for other people who have been struggling to give up smoking too.  The client ended up changing many aspects of his life through hypnotherapy and hypnosis like losing weight and cutting down on drinking.    Hypnotherapy is an effective and versatile tool and I am so happy to share it with you.  

Please let me know how it goes and if it helps you too.

My legs also don't feel tight when I crouch down now, which is something I didn't notice had become an issue. I keep feeling like my skin/feet/hands are fuzzy. Anyone else experienced this? I've got lymphedema in my face and that's improved somewhat, but not entirely.

Breaking the physical addiction hasn't been a big problem for me, but the psychological one is really strong.

I'm 26F. I started to smoke and drink two years ago. To sum up I have schizophrenia and I didn't know at the time so I spent like six months having hallucinations 24/7. I used to drink to keep the hallucinations more positive and ""happy"" and after that, I started with the cigarettes. In the beginning, I was smoking three a day and the number got higher when I started to work home office in August of last year. I lost my job in January but I still work as a freelancer from home. I'm way better now and under treatment, drinking and hallucinating isn't a problem anymore, but smoking is. I cannot see a way to do anything without smoking. I'm currently smoking one pack in 2 days. I have no focus in my work, I can't distract myself, I can't work on my hobbies. I just walk in circles smoking. If I keep doing this I know things will get so much worse.

I’ve tried quitting before and tried all the NRT products and this one worked the best for me.
The average cigarette contains 10mg to 12mg of nicotine, but our body inhales a little over 1mg of nicotine per smoke.  
I went with the 1 mg nicotine lozenges (mints).  You can get them in 4 mg, 2 mg and 1 mg.  I went with 1 mg because I didn’t want more nicotine in my system. It seems the lowest patch is 7mg and the lowest gum is 2mg per piece.
I like the mints because they are the lowest dose and they last around 30 minutes while they dissolve, so they give you something to do instead of smoking.  
I bought candy mints that came in a small container and then emptied out the candy mints.  I wanted to start out with 10 nicotine mints a day; so I would put 10 nicotine mints in my candy mint container and kept it in my pocket.  This made the nicotine mints always available, made it look discrete, and helped me keep track of how much nicotine I’m using.  
Each day, I’d reduce the nicotine mints, but when I got down to five nicotine mints, I cut them in half so I had twice as many mints which was great.  As of today, I’m on day 16 without smoking and I’m down to one nicotine mint that I’ve cut into eight pieces, so I’m having one mg of nicotine a day (which is very little), so I can switch to candy mints now and shouldn’t notice a thing...
You can break nicotine mints in half, quarters or 1/8’s with your fingers, a knife or a pill cutter.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.989544689655304}"

You have to stop
You would safe so much money
You get healthier and better skin
You want to become fitter
Woman dislike a smokers mouth

1 year I was literally always thinking after each cig ""just fucking stop, it's not worth it."" just to smoke the next one after 20min.

And then on the 16th April I did it. I smoked the last cigarette and woke up with mediocre wants for a cigarette. The first 4 days were not even that hard, i thought it would be hell.

Everytime I had like really bad craving I was doing 30 push ups. I do eat a lot of candy atm but boys and girls, who cares about some pounds more?

And now after 15 days, I don't feel any craving anymore. I think about what I told to me the whole year and that it finally became true. I hope this will last another 15 days, 2 months and forever but I'm positive :)
