Recently I had a bad feeling in my lungs so I stopped completely and over the past month I‚Äôve experienced shortness of breath and I have bibasilar crackles. Of course I smoked everything from a juul to carts but definitely not as much as a lot of my buddies. I‚Äôm upset because I went to the doctor to get it checked out. They Xrayed me and said I was fine but my lungs do not feel normal at all. Just wondering if anyone else had experienced anything similar and I‚Äôm hoping someday the crackles will go away or if anyone knows if there is treatment or not.,3,0

My background-alcohol in recovery/heavy smoker/anxiety issues/yada yada.  Stopped smoking with NRT-patches and lozenges.  21 mg patch with as needed 4 mg lozenge. It was hell.  Even with the NRT.  Maybe especially with the NRT.  I‚Äôd get through 2 weeks of struggle till I‚Äôd feel emotionally even and then I‚Äôd cut down my NRT and feel insane again.  2 additional weeks of taper and repeat. 

Today I‚Äôm 4 days off of NRT and 40 days off of smoking.  I wish with EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING that I had just gone cold Turkey 40 days ago.  I feel like the NRT never quite scratched the itch and extended the agony of w/d.  Now I endorse NRT if medically, for COPD or surgery or whatever, one needs to just not smoke no matter what.  If the goal is to leave nicotine behind (as was my goal) I‚Äôd recommend just jumping.  Make the decision and jump.  There‚Äôs really not great taper information out there and I didn‚Äôt want to just transfer one nicotine addiction for another.

I used a vape to finally kick the smoking habit and it worked like a charm (picked up a caliburn G for $30 online). 6mg free base juice wasn't enough so I had to switch to 18mg salt nic. That did the trick and made it rather easy to remove smoking from my mind. While an argument can certainly be made that vaping is less harmful than smoking, it is not a risk free and safe method of nicotine consumption like many think. I was noticing some tightness in my chest and slightly labored breathing so I decided it was time to quit vaping. Boy howdy, even with the patches, this has been difficult, but just a week in and I feel a lot better. It's amazing how much damage that vape was doing to me.

I feel like using the vape to get off cigarettes was the right choice. It made it relatively easy to end the smoking habit and I'm now quitting a habit that I've been doing for less than a year rather than one that has been snowballing for 15. That said, I vaped differently that I smoked. Rather than go out for a few puffs every other hour like smoking, it was more like 2 puffs every 5 minutes. I am almost always in an environment that allows me to vape freely so I was almost always vaping. It just complimented everything I did and I'm finding the habit hard to get over.

The hardest parts are after meals and when I first wake up (which is why I'm typing this wall of rambling as a way to distract my mind). Meals just don't feel complete unless I take a few puffs and chain smoking/vaping has been my morning ritual for as long as I can remember (I honestly can't remember a time when it wasn't this way). I started by using the 21mg patch and 3mg juice 7 days ago. I used the 3mg juice for a day to take the edge off and 0mg juice for a day and a half after that. I've since abstained from any vaping and am just using the 21mg patch. I still have my vape, but if I wanted to use it, I'd have to go to the store to buy a coil. I always sleep with my patch on because it makes my dreams beyond fucked up and i enjoy crazy terrifying dreams a lot. I woke up today and the withdrawals weren't that bad. I decided I'm going to leave yesterday's patch on and am going to try to go the day without putting a new one on. Those bitches are crazy expensive so I'll be thrilled if I never have to use one again. 

What has been the hardest times for you to quit smoking and or vaping? What are some things you've done or thought about that have helped you to stay strong? For me, a huge thing is that I find smoking and vaping to be pathetic and immature. I respect how strong of an addiction it is and that many of us started when we were young and stupid, but I still find the entire thing to be childish/embarrassing and self loathing has always been a strong motivator for me. That and I lived with a grandparent that has copd and emphysema and a friend of mine has really bad throat cancer. She's a lovely person, but being around her is a unpleasant reminder of what's awaiting me if I don't get my shit together. To add to the whole me being embarrassed of this habit thing, being over at a friend's seeing my friends smoke as this poor woman is violently blowing snot through the hole in her throat just adds to the whole cringe factor of this stupid decision. I'm impressed that you actually read this whole thing. It helped me to get over the need to be vaping right now. Sorry there wasn't really a point to this post. I just needed to vent and occupy my mind as I woke up. I'm gonna go make some oatmeal with peanut butter, maple syrup, apple chunks, and raisins. Might even add some almost milk if I'm feeling naughty. Wish me luck.",10,0

I‚Äôm on day 12 of my quit and it‚Äôs going mostly well. I feel very commitment and I know I made the right choice and am giving myself a precious gift of a smoke-free life.

Addiction can do such funny things to your brain!!

Tomorrow I‚Äôm going on a first date and it will be my first date in over a decade as a non-smoker. It used to give me anxiety to go on first dates as a smoker because I‚Äôd worry it would turn them off (it probably/definitely did).

The stress of ¬´¬†coming out¬†¬ª as a smoker (non-smokers would be so surprised and dismayed when I‚Äôd light up).

18,2021-08-30 10:43:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pejhao/why_social_smoking_is_counterproductive/,Why social smoking is counterproductive,"A lot of times people say ""I only smoke when I drink"" or ""I only smoke socially"". I used to do that myself till I kicked the habit for good. But when you're an addict, all it does is bring your addiction to a new level. 

For example, I started quitting last year in April when I saw friends share articles about smoking putting you at higher risk for covid. I started to smoke only while drinking, and only with friends that smoked. I did good for the most part and would never smoke at home and made sure to never buy packs (a very helpful method), but if I was drinking with smokers, eventually the cravings would kick in and I found myself smoking a few times a month until I had my last one in December. 

What made me realize I was going on the wrong path was a night of heavy drinking in November and I was bumming smokes off multiple people (which I can tell was annoying some people). And it's a slippery slope because you don't wanna buy packs and become a regular smoker again but you also don't wanna be a mooch either. This is why cold turkey is the best method. Not to mention that even if you're only smoking socially, I feel like it makes you look forward to those few cigarettes and you might even tell yourself ""it's ok to do it now, I'm drinking"" and then before you know it, you're addicted again. Even if you don't become a regular smoker again, it's possible to make a habit out of social smoking if you drink regularly. 

After some time has passed, I'm at a point where the smell of smoke is so disgusting that I'm actively discouraged to smoke when drinking as opposed to encouraged. My anxiety levels have drastically decreased too.",3,1

Regardless of your reason for quitting, any reason is legitimate and don't underestimate that. 

There's a reason friends of mine that still smoke are envious of me quitting and tell me good for you. Now that doesn't make me ""better than them"" or ""above them"" but it makes me proud of being able to do something most smokers wish they could do. And trust me quitting wasn't easy. I can't count how many times I said I was gonna quit or how many slip ups I had till I quit for good. Meaning no smokes when drinking or any time.",3,0

it is crazy how i never even crave a cigarette. i can stand next to my smoking friends and dont waste a secound on thinking about asking them to get one. i had a cigarette two weeks ago but it tasted disguisting and didnt give me any sort of relieve. also snus is prooven to be dozens of times healthier than smoking so you can take your time to finally quit.

of course it might be different for everyone but for me its like a miracolous healing that i didnt think would be possible so if nothing works for you try switching and dosing down",2,0

I think it genuinely makes the world a better place and by internet standards that‚Äôs saying something. I recently made the decision to turn my life around. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot of alcohol, coffee, not sleeping or eating well, basically hitting the self destruct button every chance I get. I‚Äôm over the alcohol and caffeine (2 weeks and little to no cravings, just mild depression and irritability), and now I have these bastard cigarettes in my sights. Since I‚Äôve abandoned my other vices I‚Äôve been smoking like crazy. Has anyone been in a similar situation (quitting multiple things), and if so, what advice would you have in terms of what my best course is going forward. I‚Äôve tried quitting smokes before and know how difficult it is, should I give myself a bit more time? Thanks and wishing everyone the best on their journey to a healthier, happier self",1,0

I was so irritable and fiending for a fix that I practically shoved my way out of the terminal asap and chain-smoked like 4 in a row before I was ready to think about anything else.

We had to stay overnight in the airport for an early flight home. My 3 non smoker friends wanted to go to the departing terminal to see if there was anything open to eat or a comfortable spot to sleep. I was completely unwilling to lock myself in another terminal for 8 more hours so I stayed near the front door by myself, fuming at my friends for abandoning me.

Truth was that I chose the cigarettes over them. That week I quit, and haven't looked back. 

I love keeping this subreddit in my feed because it's a constant reminder that I quit, and how long it's been. For those of you who've quit, stay strong my brother or sister.

What changed? 

Over the last 3 months I have done so much for health, physically and mentally. I‚Äôve been running 3-4 days a week. My diet is fantastic. Most importantly, I quit drinking. I truly hate cigarettes in a way I‚Äôve never hated them before. Being unhealthy, there were many things I could attribute to feeling like shit. Eating shitty food. Drinking way too much alcohol. Smoking cigarettes. Now I know all the crappyness left is due to cigarettes. 

Why not quit today? Well I am following the Allen carr method and he said to set a quit and I set that quit to tomorrow a couple weeks ago so might as well stick to the plan I guess. 

It‚Äôs a weird feeling but I‚Äôm kind of looking forward to tomorrow. I know it‚Äôs gunna suck cause I‚Äôve been through it before but my confidence this time is sky high.

I went four months then went back when I started working. Then april 2021, I quit again and went 5 months but recently relapsed again. 

I know work stress has to do with it and putting my exercise routine will help that work stress however, the last time I quit, I was highly emotional. I had never cried so much in my life and I have never wanted to put all my walls up again. I started trying to date people and open myself up to actually being with people despite the walls I wanted to put up. The emotions started to get better because I was sharing my life with people and not living in isolation. 

As I have relapsed a couple days ago, I'm realizing that I have begun isolating myself again. I don't want to see anyone, talk to anyone and I know that quitting will help this but it is my comfort zone. I'm so afraid of feeling every emotion again that I have been pushing down for the last ten years. 

This is the first time quitting that I'm less afraid of the physical withdraw than I am the flood of emotions that I am going to have to feel. I know I need too and I'm going to quit again because I do believe this could be the last time I have too but I am struggling with the emotions that I will be feeling. 

I also still have many loved ones that smoke. How do you deal with those relationships?",1,0
50,2021-08-29 12:11:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdy4or/my_journey_and_where_im_at_now/,"My journey, and where I'm at now.","I quit almost a year ago to the day,  it was amazing how radically diffrent things became after. I could smell for what felt like the first time in my life. That dryer vent  5 houses down, glorious! A dead animal on the side of the road long before I actually saw it, glorious! Some one well ahead of me wearing a strong perfume/cologne, glorious. 

Then the financial stuff started pouring in, I finally stopped living paycheck to pay check. I became better financially minded in general when I was able to start seeing that money stack up!  I hit a radical savings goal in the last year thanks to not smoking.  

I felt less impulsive in general,  I started trying to learn new things. And started adopting a life style that I wanted instead of just coping with the one I had previously found myself in. 

Then about 4-5 months ago I decide having a cigarette at the bar while I had been drinking would be fine. I just bummed off of people and had zero desire for one out side of inebriation.  I was in control things were great!

Then a friend of mine got a divorce and started staying out the house. He would smoke at the house, but I had been around plenty of people that smoked and the desire was just not there to, I was in control! We started going out a bit and I continued my habit of bumming while I was drunk, but the more he was at the house and I'd hang with him while he had a smoke the more tempted i became. Fuck it I'm in control! Right? I can totally have one or two with him itll be fine, cause I'm in control! After a few weeks he was ready to go back home and I found myself with out any access to smokes. 

Well I dont smoke any more so this is fine, this is totally fine, I'm fine, I'm in control! But just in case it's not fine, lets go get a cigar from the corner store. We'll just take a little hit every now and then when we really need to. But maybe we need to like, idk preemptively take that hit so it's not so bad when that craving show up. It's ok cause we'll only have a few puff and it's only a cigar a day, I'm in control! I've got this! I dont smoke any more! I quit 7 months ago! Right?

At five cigars a day, and the horrible feeling of my lungs, I decide a pack of smokes might be the better option, the nicotine head aches were killing me from the cigars and everyone knows cigars are way worse for you than cigarettes so I'll go with the ""healthy option."" I can totally manage to ration the cigarettes why better than the cigars. I dont smoke any more, cause you know, I quit 8 months ago! 

I'm back at a pack a day and have been for the past 3 months and i cant stop thinking about how amazing that time not smoking was. But i forget to remind myself how amazing it was and only think about how amazing that sweet sweet cigarette is about to be! 

Most of my desire was gone within the first 72 hours and by a week I hardly felt any thing. The next 72 hours are going to pass either way, maybe I should try to just get through them smoke free :/",5,0
51,2021-08-29 10:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/,One Week Update,"Hello everyone,

I've decided to post about going one week. Well, it technically won't be one week until tonight at 9PM, but the probability of me not getting there is 0%, and I won't have time to to an update tomorrow, so now it is.

I made [this post last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/) and got some great feedback.

I'd like to specifically thank the people who informed me of the existence of Allen Carr's Easy Way. I have tried to quit smoking so many different times and had no real success. I listened to the audiobook and with a simple change of perspective, quitting this time has been incredibly simple.

Even in my most successful quit in 2018, I always felt vulnerable to having another smoke, falling back in, wanting a puff of of someone's smoke if I was around it. Now I don't even want one, I didn't even want my last smoke when the book told me to have it. I would legitimately recommend the easy way to anyone who needs to stop smoking. It isn't painful or inconvenient. Cravings are actually enjoyable because it's fun to starve that addiction out. I don't want a cigarette, my addiction does, and if it doesn't get what it wants, it dies. Seriously, cravings are fun and it is almost disappointing how quickly they disappear. Not really of course, because everything else improves so much.

Some changes I'm noticing:

Days are long. When you aren't constantly worried about time management or when and where you can get a cigarette in, you have significantly more time to do things. As mentioned in my first post, I am a small business owner and am used to working 12-13 hours per day. Since cutting out smoking, I haven't worked more than 10, and I've been getting more done than before. This is an insane amount of gained efficiency at the cost of absolutely nothing.

I was worried about the first few days/weeks/months being hell while trying to kick nicotine. It wasn't. It's easy as long as you know that you don't want a smoke. Just stop to smell your fingers every once in a while, it's so much nicer when they don't smell like smoke.

I was not warned about the increase in energy. I'm not sure if this is going to stabilize or taper off in the coming weeks, but it is inconsistent so far. Day one and two were as usual. Day three, I was completely lethargic and actually couldn't get my work done at all. I can't say for sure if that was related to smoking, but it happened. Day four I got up at 4am with a ton of energy and finished the work I'd left from the previous day and easily caught back up. Since then, I have had the highest amount of energy I've had in years. Not in an panicked or twitchy way, but in a wanting to enjoy things kind of way. I've started walking 5 km (3 miles) every evening, on top of my 3x per week workouts just because I want to. And for me that is different because getting any exercise previously involved tremendous discipline.

Money savings, obviously in a week it isn't that much ($105), but I have taken that amount and put it into a separate investment account. I've always been very into personal finance and good with money (the irony of actually having to build my cigarettes into a budget for the past 11 years), and so I think with this, in 10-15 years I'll be able to buy something just fantastic when I retire. I love the idea of getting a Ferrari with a license plate reading ""Smoke Free"". But we'll see. I'm not concerned about that too much, but I will continue putting away this $105 per week just to track the saved money more than the app, and keep myself disciplined from replacing cigarettes with another expensive habit.

My house became a lot cleaner. I don't just mean because I have all this extra time to give things a quick wipe and get the dishes put away faster; that's happened too, but the big one is there isn't cigarette mess anymore. No ash on the deck that didn't make it into the ash tray, no butts to deal with, less dirty shoes walking through the house to get to the deck tracking dirt in, etc. I've never really realized what a mess cigarettes made before this. Everything about my surroundings is cleaner. This goes double for the vehicles.

I didn't realize how infrequently this would cause me to go inside gas stations. I've come to the conclusion that the only people who physically enter gas stations more than 2x per month are people who only use cash, buy lottery tickets, or cigarettes. And let me tell you, I sure to not miss waiting behind those lottery ticket people.

I'm trying to think of some other changes I've noticed. My breathing was always fine despite how much I used to smoke so I haven't really noticed an improvement there, at least not a blatant one. Still, I can't imagine my lungs aren't a lot happier.

Overall, I am yet to find a negative thing about quitting. It's painless and easy if done the right way. I wish I'd been told that years ago. If we're playing the hindsight game, I'd first liked to have never started, and second would have liked to have been turned on to Allen Carr's way. It might not work for everyone, but it sure as hell did for me. I'm thankful to be off of cigarettes at 30 years old.

One week sounds like premature celebration, but I don't think it is. I don't have any desire to smoke again. Certainty is always scary, but unless there's a gun to my head, the chances of having another puff again are 0. And maybe still even with that scenario.

I'll probably stop by and write more of these as I keep progressing to keep track of it. It is because of this sub that I am not a smoker. I hope I can help get a few other people there, and a lot further than I am right now by doing so. Thank you all so much.",3,0

I have more control on the cravings and not really addicted to vaping as now I vape 2-3 times a day like a cigarette. I have experienced clean skin and more focus during vaping. The only drawback is dehydration, and I have to drink more water than I used too, even keeping a water bottle with me. The other thing is the nicotine amount that I consume is 6mg and it is enough for me as I was a chain smoker. I'm trying to lower the amount of nicotine by 3mg each month and hopefully will quit.",0,0

I‚Äôve tried quitting at least 20 times, but the ‚Äúcold turkeys‚Äù were detrimental for school and overall learning (best way I could describe it is if there was a log stuck in my brain). 

So after the cold turkey attempts I bought some nicotine gum (4mg Nicorette). It was okay, there was definitely an improvement from cold turkey, but it was very temporary. I made it to 10 days, then relapsed with the boys. $50 down the drain. 

Now I‚Äôm on the patches (day 4, strongest dose for a month w/ doctor guidance) and I think I‚Äôve found the one that suits me. It‚Äôs much more expensive (7 days instead of 50 pieces of gum), but it suits me. My energy levels are normal, I‚Äôm studying like a normal, non-smoker, and my sleep has been fine as well. 

KEEP IN MIND THAT everyone has different metabolisms. One man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure, but one KEY TIP is to keep the cravings to yourself. If you‚Äôre in a group of smokers and you have a craving, don‚Äôt say a word about the craving, or it can go South really quick (we‚Äôre addicts, we rationalize then regret it).

6. Christopher Tin - Calling All Dawns - Kia Hora Te Marino ; Because it's a beautiful and uplifting combination of message and music, and you can't have Baba Yetu without it
7. Journey - The Essential Journey - Don't Stop Believin' ; Things are crap right now, but unless you have a little bit of faith, they can't get better, so trust the future and trust your fellows. That's the essence of quitting, I think
8. Christopher Tin - Calling All Dawns - Baba Yetu ; This piece has such amazing energy that I just couldn't leave it off. And you can't have Kia Hora Te Marino without it
9. Cantus - That Eternal Day - Simple Gifts ; If you can't understand it, I don't know if I can explain it. This is my favorite rendition of the song, despite not including two verses

I am Korean, and started smoking since 21. I smoke 4 or 5 cig a day, on top of vaping. I am currently 31 now, so 10 years of smoking.

I started feel the changes in my tastes.

Before, I had no problem eating fruits and vegetable.
Watermelons, kiwi, cucumber, carrots, bananas. 

But around when I was 24, I could not eat avocados, and reacted badly to it. I literally vomitted my guts out. 

Now I can't eat everything thats green or has that melon like flavor. I would lose my appetite and vomit everything out.

Funny thing is, if vegetables are cooked (baked or stir fried), I have no problem eating them. 

So I started assuming if my liver has gone bad, but its doing okay so far. 

So I was wondering if anyone had similar experience here. 

Did anyone have problem eating vegetable or fruits while they were still smoking? Did it change after quitting smoking?

If it did, how long did it take?

Thank you for your time.

1. Smoked cig and vaped total of 10 years.

2. Hated avocado before, but now I can't eat any vegetable or fruit. Would vomit my guts out. Before smoking I loved eating them.

I have been a chain smoker for the last 15 years and never thought I'd be able to quit. I started vaping to quit smoking and it's been about half a year since my last cigarette. That is huge for me and it's gotten to the point where I find the smell of cigarettes to be unpleasant. I still know that they taste better than they smell, but I only crave them when I'm drinking and even that is getting easier to handle. About 5 or 6 days ago, I decided enough was enough and it was time to get off the vape. 

I was vaping 18mg juice like I was getting paid to. I'm disabled so I am almost always in an environment where I can vape which means I'm hitting that thing constantly. I got some patches and switched to the 3mg juice I had from a while ago. Did that for a day then switched to 0mg juice. I'll puff on the 0mg a little when I first wake up and after meals (though I'm getting better at not using it after eating), but nicotine in vape juice is the only reason you feel the vapor when you inhale. 0mg juice is like breathing in shower steam so it's not too difficult for me to put it in my bedroom and leave it be. Patches are pretty damn expensive and my crappy disability insurance won't pay for them, but it's a worthy investment. I've quit before, but I feel really confident about this time. The thing that really solidified my quiting of cigarettes was a ""zero tolerance"" rule. Especially when I'm drinking, it's very easy for me to fool myself into thinking ""what's the worst 2 drags is going to do?"" or ""butts don't count"", but that's like picking at a scab. It's hard to actually just have 2 puffs and leave it at that and it's just pushing off the healing process and making the whole situation more difficult. 

The main reason I wanted to make this post was to say thank you. Thank you for the direct help and advice you've given me, thank you for sharing your experiences, and thank you for allowing me to participate in this sub even though my struggles are more vape related now rather than just cigarettes.

Even one day without inhaling smoke you feel more energy. I thought this is because of permanent inhaling toxic smoke. But I decided to check it out, and used vape, nicotine gums or snus and realized that even I feel low energy less when use smokeless tobacco, nicotine somehow give his own effect on making low energy. Some people think that harmful only tar, not nicotine. But at least for me I feel bad sides of nicotine too. I guess it is because of nicotine is vasoconstrictor.

Now I feel more energy, more permanent energy, without spikes, as I had when I was addicted.  Sometimes i feel some low, but overall trend goes up. I think my body is recovering yet.

2) **Anxiety**

I can't say that I felt this very strongly. But by contrast you can feel it, when you compare before quit and after.  It works this way: right after your last cigarette, your nicotine levels begin to decrease, and you may not realize that you are in lack of nicotine, constant lack of nicotine, and It make anxiety, constant anxiety, some people feel it more, some less, but major ex-smokers notice that after quitting they feel them more relaxed than before. Plus nicotine have stimulant effect, It can give more anxiety to some people.

For me anxiety became less, now I can be more present and more relaxed. In truth you forget this thing  when you are totally relaxed.

3) **Escapism**

Tobacco don't give you to experience life fully: emotions, feelings, thoughts.

As we know very often to be more strong, to change our lives in the way we want to, we need to face some unpleasant thoughts and emotions.

When you're addicted, you smoke up every bad thought or emotion. I see it this way: all the people  have some heavy thoughts and emotions, but when you are nicotine addicted you feel them more stressful than they are because of anxiety because of constant lack of nicotine. You are already in stress plus stressful thoughts, emotions. And what are you doing? You are going to smoke because you are stressed. You think you are stressed because of thoughts and emotions, no, you are stressed because of lack of nicotine. And a little bit because of problem. And then you feel good. For some time. You can't understand your problem because of constant interruption. Sometimes you feel overwhelming stress and you need smoke. And this is cycle.

Also you can't feel only good emotions and not to feel bad. If you cut your bad emotions, you'll cut your good. Smoking is constant escapism from bad emotions and thoughts. Maybe I exaggerate this effect of smoking. But maybe a little bit.

I think this is one of main reasons why people begin to smoke again when they are not addicted anymore. This is called psychological addiction. And if your emotions and thoughts show themselves more after quitting, you need face them. I do it with meditation and mindfulness.

Now I feel life more, as I said I am more present, I feel good vibes more strong like in childhood, but bad vibes I feel more strong too. I feel more myself. And now instead of smoking up my heavy feelings I want to face them and understand. I can cope with them myself.

4)  **Dopamine system and concentration**

Tobacco works with dopamine system. When you smoke, you get dopamine spike.

Dopamine is your motivation and your focus. When you are constantly using substance which work with dopamine, you are hard to get motivation without it.

You must regularly get your nicotine fixes to feel your focused, but it interrupt your work, your study, whatever you do.

When I quitted, I noticed that I can focus longer, I am in the moment, totally doing task. I read how somebody on this sub thought that he had ADHD, but It was just because of smoking. Yes, that's it. When you smoke you are constantly half here, half there.

I write this post for about 2 hours, but I had only two breaks for 5 mins. For me It's unbelievable. I forgot this feeling.

5) **Overall health (Circulation, Sleep, Skin/Hair, Chest pains, Smell, Physical Activity)**

My skin and hair are more alive, more radiant, smooth, bright, more moisturized. I felt it every time when I quitted smoking.

Smoking ruined my sleep. Now my sleep quality is great and deep, I am falling asleep very fast.

My circulation had been improved, I feel how my heart pumps my blood better. Because of It you feel more energy for physical activities. I feel more sex drive. Chest pain gone. Back pain related to smoking is gone. Many things you can notice only by contrast

My smell was good before quitting, but now you feel some tones of smell better.

And yes, you feel more yourself, more connected and more confident due to the above reasons.

Also my mood and well-being increased, I think it is total effect of all these reasons, less mood swings, more stable.

And I think in a certain sense, quitting smoking is really life-changing.

**What helped me to cope with withdrawal:**

1. Meditation and mindfulness. I do it every day for 20-45 minutes. It helps me stay connected and be myself.
2. Long walking. Good physical exercise, helps when you are overwhelmed, when craving hits you. Make your mind calm.
3. I really recommend to read Easyway by Allen Carr. There are huge information and understanding how addiction works.
4. Reading this subreddit. Thank you guys very much! It helps very much! :)))
5. Computer games. It's fun and easy.
6. Journaling. Writing your thoughts, whatever you want is very useful practice.
7. Long showers. I don't know why, but every time this helps much. Exactly long showers.

Thank you very much, guys!

This community is great. You are great people. You can change your life as you want.

I tried reducing which kind of worked and then kind of don't as I didn't really reduce tbh. Last night I had a really emotional moment with a lot of self hate and crying and I threw out everything that would allow me to smoke. Iqos and all the shenanigans.

I stopped smoking on the 6th of December and an hour ago, I smoked again. 

It's always been on the back of my mind, that I'll start smoking again at some point.
All of my family members, all of my friends are smokers. 

And honestly I always thought it was something that I liked, but today, I learned a very important lesson.
SMOKING IS AS SHITTY AS IT SOUNDS 

Every drag of that damn thing made me nauseous and wanting to cough my lungs out.. 

I stopped half way through it, and just spend 10 minutes washing my hands and brushing my teeth. 

My heart was racing in my ribcage, my head was spinning and I even nearly collapsed at some point. 

Now I'm waiting for those side effects to disappear. 
I'm a VERY anxious dude and I don't know why, I feel like this nearly caused me a panic attack.
Hell, I feel like I can't tell which effects came from the cigarette and which came from anxiety. 

Anyway, i posted this here, as a reminder to myself (and maybe everyone else) that it's a disgusting habit we're all better off with.

And next time I'm feeling like ""lighting a stick up"", I'll hope i'll come back here and see how miserable I was.

I feel like I was a MUCH happier and pleasent person when I smoked.  Generally I am one of the more optimistic and pleasant people you'll ever meet but I'm miserable now. All the time. Everything sucks and I don't know why. 

Everything, and I mean everything, is awesome about not smoking, except this and I can't shake it.  I don't believe I've ever really had to ever deal with depression so this must be what it's like. It's always looming, like, whatever I'm doing would be better if I could smoke. Argh. It's the same kind of feeling like when you end a relationship or lose a friend. It. Fucking. Sucks. This has to be a common thing.

I mean it makes sense. Since I started smoking when I was 13, every good memory I have had in my adult life cigarettes were right there with me. 

So this feeling goes away at some point, yes?   I've been slipping, sneaking cigs here and there so I put myself back on the patch. I just want to be over and done with it. It would be so much easier just to continue smoking, but I am definitely not a casual smoker. I could be back up to a pack a day within a week.

I've been tentatively trying to quit since Monday. 
Monday was okay, I had two - one in the morning and one in the evening.
Tuesday was worse, but oh well.
And today was good, I cut out that morning cigarette and didn't smoke til like 4pm. 

I got really frustrated today because on Monday I was supposed to have a stop smoking appointment with my local GP over the phone, and no one ever called. 
Today I contacted them to ask what happened and they said sorry, you were never booked in. Great. Next appointment available is over a month away. I almost cried when I hung up the phone because I felt frustrated that even my local healthcare services didn't seem to want to help. It's been a tough time for everyone recently, especially healthcare workers, so I graciously took the appointment, drove to the pharmacy and bought some NRT.. 
I popped on a patch when I got home and realised that (after a nap) the overwhelming background feeling of always wanting a cigarette was gone. 
Tonight I will allow myself one, my last one. Tomorrow is game time. I know it's going to be rough but I can do this, I just need to keep myself occupied. Pick up some crochet, do some of my university reading. This is the time to make a change for my future. I've been accepted for teacher training to start in September and I want to stop because I can't teach and smoke. I need to be a good role model. I also don't want a pupil to annoy me then I crave a cig all day.

First of all...the time has gone so quickly! It it hard to believe it has been over 15 days today!

Some observations:

The absolute worst part of the journey so far has been the digestive issues. I really was not expecting this. It seems to get better for a day or two, then back to the same constipation for a few days. I've done all of the suggested treatments (increase fibre, increase exercise, increase water...). It really brings me down because I am worried this is permanent. I read other posts on this subreddit where people are suffering with this for prolonged periods of time!

The food cravings have been present, but I was always addicted to sugar anyhow, even when I was a smoker. So I can not yet establish if this is due to quitting. Although I have gained weight since I quit, it is only about 2 pounds which is ok. I am ready to get back on track with diet and exercise.

I am fairly certain my IQ has plummeted since I quit. I can not remember how to spell certain things and I just feel like a moron in general. I think this is getting progressively better, this brain fog clearing. 

I feel like I don't know what to do with my free time, especially my morning routine. I used to wake up and chain smoke with endless cups of coffee for over an hour, then start my day. I was left feeling spaced out and sick, sometimes trembling from the amount of nicotine and caffeine in my system! i certainly DO NOT MISS that horrible feeling, I just don't know what to do in the morning when I wake up and drink my coffee. I am hoping it will transition into reading or something similar.

The actual cravings for cigarettes are completely gone! But I am left with an annoyance and anxiety about the  digestive issues. I just have this impatience about getting back on track with weight loss as well.

Overall, I will say it was MUCH EASIER than I anticipated, the actual quitting and forgetting about cigarettes! I am really happy about that! 

The other problems will iron themselves out with time, I will just have to learn to be patient!

I still can not figure out why I smoked for so long, and why I had such a fear of quitting! It is much easier than quitting alcohol in my experience. It is the best thing I have ever done (aside from quitting booze)!",3,0
127,2021-08-25 16:02:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pbj55b/day_2/,Day 2.,"Day 2, last week I relapsed and ended up smoking about 1.3 oz of tabbaco over 4 days, after 3 or 4 years clean with a cig maybe once a year. The craving are strong, my body wants me to smoke the equivalent of a half pack a day. Yesterday I felt like I was starting over at square one. 

I was feeling low, few people knew how I felt I failed myself, my current struggle, and even fewer where proud. The withdrawal wasn't helping with these emotions, but this community did.

My day 2 will be easier for me because of all the support I got from everyone here. Thank you so much. It had been so long for me, that l had forgotten all the hard work I've put into quitting in the past, all the tips and self love that are so important to the process.

Forgive yourself for your mistakes. It's so hard, but one of the most important things imo. You haven't failed, you haven't screwed up your whole life, and you haven't thrown all the work you've put in away. If your waking up from 17 years of smoking, relapsed after 4 hours or 4 years of quitting, where ever you are, that's all ok, you are doing the most important part of quitting, wanting to do it. If you are just starting to think about quitting but haven't started yet because you are afraid you'll fail, at least you'll have tried and know you can try again, that's not a failure, that's an opportunity to develop a winning attitude. Many of us have had to try multiple multiple times, that's just part of the road.

Dust yourself off, destroy that pack you have sitting on your table and start.

Show gratitude for yourself, all the hard work you've put in to getting where you are today is a gift to yourself, if you are just starting to think about quitting or have been smoke free for years. Those are big accomplishments and you should be proud of yourself. Encourage yourself like you would anybody else. This will foster your motivation instead of punishing the addict (who will just run to the corner store for a pack).

Name your whys and remember them. It can be big things like, cancer, COPD, your kids, but for me, thinking about getting winded during sex or not being able to taste my whiskey, while silly sounding are more tangible and can beat back any craving. At the end of the day, you are doing this for yourself. Find something that speaks to you and hold onto it.

Take care of your whole self, withdrawal is a bitch and comes with a whole slew of symptoms. From the psychological, emotional and the physical, you are going to need to replace your habitual breaks, deal with the amplified emotions, and the quitters flu. Go for a walk while you think about your whys. Eat healthy while reminding yourself these symptoms will pass and you are stronger then this. Just step outside and breath some fresh air or scream into a pillow and nap. Withdrawal causes hormone imbalances, your immune system will kick off and start clearing tar from your lungs, and it will really suck at times, you might even have more trouble breathing for a little bit. This too shall pass. Even if the battle is just in your head, the war is wide spread.

Identify your triggers, if its alcohol, stimulants, a person you love, a place or even a show, identify them. Confront the reality that you might not be ready to integrate those into your journey of cessation, at least for today, or that it might make things harder and you'll need to be stronger.

Seek support when you need it. I didn't have it yesterday and I needed it. I am so grateful for everbody here, sharing their stories, lending support to those that need it, just rooting for eachother, telling everyone that needs it they are proud of you. I am proud of you, I really am. If I, a complete stranger can be proud of you, I hope you can be proud of yourself.

Share your stories, don't stop when it gets hard, start. Tell people of your struggles, your successes, your tips. It will remind you of what you've done that worked and didn't work, of all the hard work you've put into getting exactly where you are and how grateful you should be to yourself. Share genuinely your empathy so you can know others sharing with you is real.

Quotes, someone shared a nice quote with me.
 ""Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, I will try again tomorrow"" 
So many people came to my post yesterday with that same message and it is so important for success. However you remember things, quotes can be an easy way to bring it all back. I've always liked one that's ""look at how far you've come, it would be a shame to stop now"" or something like that. It reminds me to be grateful, that every step backwards isn't starting over, that you can always keep going. We all, every single person here, have put in so much work just to be where we are today, and no drug can ever take that away from us.

Cessation aids, a lot of people are doing cold turkey, and that's fucking badass but that doesn't work for everyone. If you are going to buy a pack while trying cold turkey, I encourage you to reach for a cessation aid instead. Follow the directions. They are majorly less addictive, if you look at the addictive predictors of a drug, a major one is the response curve. Take a drag of a cigarette and get hit immediately with a rush of nicotine, your mind makes a much stronger association, your body starts going into over drive to compensate for this poison, you end up crashing harder, needing more and more just to reach a baseline. Gums, lozenges and patches are all much slower at releasing nicotine, giving your body time to settle and wean off. Some of these you can even get a prescription for, the patch in the US can end up being the cost of your copay for 4 weeks.

Everyone's story that was shared with me was so different and so similar at the same time. It was so nice to remember I am not alone. You are not alone, you are on the same journey so many have taken and have succeeded. You can succeed, you are succeeding.

Yesterday, I didn't know why I was quitting  other then that I knew I should. I didn't know if I was going to go buy a pack today or the next. Today i remember. Today I know that I bought my first pack in years and it felt like failure, but it was just part of my success, that I am afforded the luxury to think of it in that light. Today I know I won't be buying another pack for a long time. Thank you all for helping me start off my quit again with the right attitude. I wish you all the luck, strength, self love, and what ever else you need, in the world. You have got this.",15,1

A few weeks prior, I had on and off chest pain. I associated it to anxiety because most of the time a cardio session at the gym would help it go away. A few days after posting, I woke up with chest pain that was worse and lasted all day. That evening, I decided to go to the ER. The ER performed various tests (EKG, blood test, xray, etc.) and informed me that my heart was fine. However, they said I  have emphysema!! I was in disbelief and spent the following week trying to process the diagnosis. 

I made a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist. The pulmonologist performed many tests and told me my lungs were at 145% (well above average) and that there is no way that I have emphysema. Realizing  how important this was to me, he ordered a CT scan to verify his findings. The CT scan came up negative for emphysema, however, it did show a 4mm nodule growth on my lungs and a mild aorta aneurysm! He informed me that any single growth less than 6mm on a low risk patient can be ignored. He referred me to a cardiologist to follow up on the ct scan results and chest pain.

I met with the cardiologist and he said that typically when chest pain is related to heart issues, exercise makes it worse and not better. He spent a great deal of time going through all of my data and told me that he is ordering a heart ultrasound and stress test to confirm the aortic aneurysm and verify that the rest of my heart is in good shape. If the ultrasound goes as expected, I will need to get a CT scan every three years to ensure the aorta aneurysm doesnt get any larger. 

To sum it all up: I quit vaping and started the patch system. Chest pain caused me to go the ER. I was misdiagnosed with emphysema. Follow up with a pulmonologist ordered a CT scan which found that I had a aortic aneurysm.

As you can imagine, I was scared shitless leaving the ER when I was first (mis)diagnosed with emphysema. That encouraged me to stay on track with my taper. I used the patch system and got off the last step (3) two days ago. The patch system made it extremely manageable to quit vaping. The hardest part was initially getting over the ceremonial habits (after eating, waking up, playing games, etc). After a week, my mind was already forgetting about it. 

After stepping off of the patches, I have been a little foggy headed the last few days. It hasnt been terrible. I have used a small nibble of a 4mg nicotine lozenge each day since (2mg a day). I plan on dropping the lozenges completely by the end of the week. 

I am under 40 years old. While I originally wasn't terribly worried about the effects of vaping from a lung standpoint. I am a healthy weight, work out weekly, etc. I never considered the vasoconstriction effects of nicotine. I have no doubts that the vaping led to the aneurysm. I am posting this as an FYI and for support as I transition into not using nicotine as well as go through my last few heart tests (ultrasound and stress test).",13,0

I have recently stumbled across this group on Reddit and have been blown away by the compassion, support and solidarity that people have for eachother here. It is truly a beautiful thing to behold. I wish I could reply to every message and send you all my unconditional support.

Today I am celebrating 100 days without smoking. I started smoking 12 years ago and very quickly became a heavy smoker. All day from the moment I got up, to the moment I went to sleep. Punctuating my whole life with cigarettes. I avoided places I knew I couldn't smoke. Was a secret smoker from my family for many years. I avoided family events, said no to so many things because I knew I wouldn't be able to smoke. The time I did spend with them was so often framed by me constantly thinking about how I could get away, what excuse I could make up to disappear for 10 minutes to go and smoke.

I have tried and failed to quit many times before, but this time I am feeling confident it's the one that will stick.

I did not go cold turkey. I am so, so, so impressed by the people that do. I personally was not brave or resilient enough to take that step.

I started on 21mg Nicotine patches, but actually didn't stop smoking at first. I was in the weird place of wanting to quit, but also wanting to smoke. So I forced myself to wear the patches and gave myself permission to smoke of I wanted to. Smoking on the patches was so unpleasant l, rough, and hard work that I soon was able to stop. Every drag felt like your 100th cigarette of the day and gave me no satisfaction. I followed the full NRT patch program, doing 4 weeks of Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3.

I know how hard this addiction is to break, and I wanted to tell you that it does get easier. And quitting really is possible. Even if it may seem like an impossibility. You really can do it. I believe in all of you.

You can do it.",15,0

i went from thinking about smoking...constantly. every minute. to going days without thinking about it. and even when it does come up, it's in passing, and i go ""huh that's interesting, it's been a while since i felt that way."" no more skin crawling, mind numbing, rage inducing cravings. just...existence.

i quit cold turkey. i had one day (around day 12, i think) where i slipped and bought a pack and had about 5 cigarettes. it was the first day of going back to therapy. and i didn't have any slip ups since then, so i didn't reset my counter (a personal decision). i've had a glass of wine about twice since then, with no cravings!

just wanted to share, since i know when i was very early in my quit, posts like this gave me a lot of hope that things could get better. all you have to do is keep not smoking. the rest will slowly fall into place. stay strong, friends!",28,0

I don't know if that one counts, as it was right after surgery and I was basically bed-ridden for three of them.

This place has been a huge help; I've found a quit buddy and we're kind of leaning on each other and I think we're  doing better together than we would alone.

I took a risk today. I walked down to the corner store and bought a soda. It was like 35% because I wanted a soda, and 65% putting myself in the way of temptation. I'm proud to say I walked out of the store without any cigarettes. 

I'm looking forward to tomorrow and dreading it at the same time. Supposedly, the worst is over. But I'm worried that believing that will have me relaxing my guard.

EDIT ***I haven‚Äôt had a cigarette since September 5th, 2021üòä***

I'm 20 f, been smoking since I was 14 and have smoked a pack a day since I was 15, used to be two. I once quit for 7 months using a vape but I don't want to do that either. My main reason why I still smoke is because it's essentially an adult blankie to me. It's comfort, it soothes me when I am upset and now it's a horrible nasty habit of mine. 

I have borderline personality disorder, I have come a very long way but still struggle keeping my cool around the people I love the most. I am extremely high anxiety and the way that surfaces is by, for lack of a better term, being a total bitch. I have a smoke to calm me down and remove myself from the situation before I start being mean to people who don't deserve it.

I am terrified of how I might treat the people I love and others because I can't always control my emotions. I can't find a therapist who will help me with pretty much anything either because of the BPD diagnosis. Because I can't get therapy, it will be extremely difficult to control myself. Even if I'm not mean to other people, I am very cruel to myself especially when stressed. Smoking helped me quit cutting and I'm scared that even if I do hold out on reacting towards someone who doesn't deserve it, I might not be able to stop it from it being directed towards myself either. 

Quitting smoking is terrifying for me, I don't want to be cruel to the people I care about and I don't know how to cope without them anymore. If anyone is in a similar dependency to cigarettes and has quit or is quitting, could you please share some tips on how to keep your cool without cigarettes?

People who quit also experienced more positive feelings and better psychological wellbeing.  Giving up smoking did not have an impact on the quality of people‚Äôs social relationships and it is possible that stopping smoking may be associated with a small improvement in social wellbeing.

I kinda snapped and said ‚Äúwell fucking go and buy some then! Don‚Äôt be wishing for me to fail and kill myself because you FANCY one and feel you can switch it on and off. It‚Äôs horrible. Don‚Äôt say that to me again.‚Äù - they were a bit surprised and to be honest, so was I! 

It‚Äôs because of the relapse and the comment last week or so that made me snap today. It‚Äôs been playing on my mind. ‚ÄúOh, thank god!‚Äù What‚Äôs bugged me is not that they said it. But, that I knew this was the attitude from them and would be the whole weekend. So, because I struggle with expectations of others and letting people down.. I CHOSE to smoke to keep the peace. This shouldn‚Äôt be peace. Comments like that aren‚Äôt peace. 

Don‚Äôt do that again. Many benefit from you smoking. - a free fag, they see you as the smoker and ‚Äúonly smoke with you‚Äù and therefore feel lost when you stop.

I found out I have a terrible time coping around 10am and again pretty much the full time from 2pm-11pm thanks to the screaming kids playing and running all around my apartment complex since its summer. The 10am I can handle. I still don't have a strategy to cope with that big chunk of time where I tend to be most productive and need most to relax/wind down. I have NO IDEA what will make that time EASIER for me except the weather changing/getting colder, and I know that isn't an excuse and I don't want to wait that long. I know kids will be kids but this quit is about me and my (smoking cessation) problem...I am never going to love the sound of other people making a ton of noise when I need quiet. It's part of my personality.

Earplugs arriving Wednesday...maybe I'll make it through today without a cigarette but I feel in-between this non-smoker/rather smoke brain. I hate the smell of tobacco after I have smoked and that's been the number one thing keeping me off the stuff. I can't find a reason anymore that smoking during the noise helps me...but when it *finally* stops at night I seem to want to enjoy that silence and relax, sharing that time with a cigarette. 

Maybe I'm lonely for another adult, but don't want the commitment of actually talking to somebody. : (  Does anybody know what I mean? Thanks to COVID I can't get my choice of therapist or even get an appointment with somebody random for over a month.

I have to be completely honest - not only am I trying to quit smoking, this is also my first post ever on Reddit. I actually joined because a friend who quit 3 years ago recommended that the sense of community can be really helpful. So I'm really sorry if this is a bit long and ramble-y.

a little background - back in high school, I was an athlete and a musician. I could sing and run long distance and captained my school soccer team. I had never even taken a single puff even though my dad and plenty of my friends smoked regularly. I had no issues being around them while they smoked because I had no cravings and no interest in doing so whatsoever.  

within a year of turning 18 and starting college, I started smoking. I started associating a lot of things with smoke - coffee, a rainy day, reading, being productive while working, hanging out with friends, waiting for someone on the roadside, right after a meal - you guys probably know the rest. 

fast forward nearly 4 years and I have been smoking close to a pack a day - I now smoke when I drive, when I listen to music, when I'm out on a walk, all the time, practically. what's worse, because my parents are cool with my smoking around the house, I have no pressure to quit from them either. 

I recently decided to try using my free time to reinvigorate my past interests in soccer and singing - I found that my highly reduced lung strength made it really hard to do either. I played a game with a bunch of really average players last week and felt terrible about how drastically my ability to keep running tirelessly was gone. I tried to home record a song I wrote and could barely sustain notes beyond a few seconds. 

but despite the obvious potential benefits to my dearest hobbies if I quit this shitty habit, I'm afraid of quitting. Something tells me I'll become a different person if I do - because through my years in college and first couple of years working, I have become a person surrounded by smoke. I feel like I won't have that one cigarette at the end of each hour to keep motivating me at work. I feel like I won't have an activity to share with my friends (pretty much all of whom are smokers and don't particularly care about quitting at this stage), that I will lose something that has become fundamental to who I am if I quit this. I really don't want to go on - I want to be able to run and sing and just feel normal without smoke again. 

I bought my 'last pack' yesterday and am down to the last two. I guess I just want someone to tell me that the pros of quitting this addiction go far far beyond continuing with the habit. You might think I'm stupid to not be able to see that for myself, and I probably am, but I've let the smoke consume me for the past 4 years and this fear of letting it go is making me wonder whether I can actually do this. Any encouragement/suggestions/techniques would be really helpful. 

Once again, I'm sorry about the long rant. Thanks in advance to anyone who offers any advice.",9,0

After being a lurker on reddit for years, I've created an account specifically for this community as I tackle my smoke-free journey.  


I have been a smoker since I was 19 -- I'm now 30 -- and it's well beyond the time I gave up this habit for good. I've tried to quit many times in the past, but not with enough serious conviction to make it last. The longest I'd gone was 3 months in 2018, and I still regret having that one that made me start up again. Since then, my habit has become worse. I am now at around 25 cigarettes per day.  


Last Sunday as I was trying to get that god awful smell off of my clothes before attending a meeting with clients, I made the decision that in one week's time, I was going to be smoke free. The quit day is tomorrow.  


When I quit in 2018, it was the patch that I'd found the most successful. I don't want to vape, and I didn't like champix the one time I tried that. I've downloaded a smoke-free app -- I've never tried an app before and I can't see how it would hurt. Any other suggestions are more than welcome.  


I would like some advice from people who have gone through this, and for you to share tricks that really worked for you.  


My biggest hurdle is less the addiction (although that is strong), and more the habitual triggers. Driving in a car, waking up in the morning with my coffee, between beers during a night out, between periods/quarters while watching sports, between episodes of TV series, commercial breaks in general, etc. Over the past 11 years, so many unavoidable day-to-day activities have become associated with cigarettes, that I need help to disassociate with that. The worst is my mentality that whenever I am in a situation where smoking is acceptable, I need to take advantage of it assuming that I won't be able to for a few hours if I don't. That is going to be the hardest mentality to break.  


I'm 6'2 180lbs, male, a small business owner, I exercise 3x per week, eat well, and am overall healthy in every other regard. I drink once or twice per week, but not excessively. I could go through the list of reasons why I want to quit, but it's simpler to state that it doesn't have a single benefit. Not one. All it does is make me feel like an idiot and a failure while I do it.   


Anything anyone can add would be much appreciated, and I will update as I can to avoid falling back into the trap. I hate that I ever started.",10,0

As the title says, I had been smoke free for a little over 4 months until last night. What‚Äôs worse is, last night wasn‚Äôt even the _worst_ night I had since quitting! A week after I quit, my cat suddenly got very sick and I was at the vet almost every other day trying to save his life. I wanted to smoke so badly then, but I didn‚Äôt give in.

Since then, my cat has been doing much better but my mental health really declined‚Äîjust all the bullshit of everyday life kind of piling over me, day after day‚Äîso after getting into an argument with my sister, I said ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù and went out to buy a pack.

At this point, it‚Äôs 2 in the morning and I felt as if it was too late to turn back home‚Äîmaybe I was just looking for an excuse, I have been having so many cravings lately‚Äîso I buy a pack, pull over by the lake and smoke 2 cigarettes.

And oh my GOD why did I do that? As soon as I get back home, it hits me‚Äîand then I‚Äôm suddenly puking in the bathroom sink. I remembered I had a similar reaction when I first started smoking, but that was when I was 15 years old, and I‚Äôve been smoking daily since I was 18! It was horrible! I couldn‚Äôt stand, I was so lightheaded...it just was not worth it. I didn‚Äôt even think of the possibility of it making me sick.

It‚Äôs the afternoon now, so I‚Äôm kind of just sitting here in defeat. 4 months was the longest I‚Äôve gone without a smoke in 3 years and I just fucked it up. I know why I quit, and I know that I don‚Äôt want to keep smoking, but I still feel really shitty for what I did.

Besides coming here to vent, I was wondering if any of you had any similar experiences? I‚Äôm honestly very worried because I had quit for about a year when I was 19, but picked it up again about 3 years ago. (I also don‚Äôt remember having such a strong reaction like that after going so long without it.) It really does only take 1 cigarette.

I want to do things differently this time. What is something that‚Äôs helped you after caving?",3,0

Because I mindfully chose a day and time that I really want to quit (it was before I had a dentist appointment to clean my teeth, which was a huge incentive to not cave after the appointment since I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my teeth) and I smoked my last cigarette like it would be my last one - I enjoyed every second and then said goodbye to my addiction.

I think these posts are mostly for me, but some background.  I'm a United Statesian (Or something, America is a pair of continents, not a country), 38 years old, and identify as male which coincides with my biology.  I'm currently on HOUR 17 of my latest quit, but this one feels different.

Two months ago I went to the ER at about 5 AM with chest pains.  I'm 6'0"", 212 lbs at the time, no family history, only risk factors being a) congenital hypertension and b) smoking.  And I had a freaking heart attack at 38 years old.  

So begins the attempts to change habits.  Stop smoking, start exercising, be... healthier.  I started biking to work again.  But then stopped, because 106 degree heat wave.  The diet thing is hard because I don't like much that's not horrible for me.  I'm sucking it up and dealing though because my wife was recently diagnosed with Diabetes, so we're going to do better than that.

And of course, stop smoking.  I was between 4 and 6 cigarettes a day at the time I went to the ER.  And...  I still am close.  

You know, my wife, my doctor, my hospital, my insurance company, my employer, my friends, and my parents all want me to quit and be successful.  They've all been so supportive about it.  But I don't think that **I** really, honestly wanted to quit until...  very recently.

Quitting has felt like something I **had** to do, but not something I **wanted** to do.  But a few days ago (two, three?) I realized that it's my birthday in just a few days.  25 August I'll turn 39.  And while in this part of the world it's traditional to receive gifts on your birthday, this year I really want to GIVE one - I want to give my wife a smoke-free husband for my birthday.

I started smoking about 1 year this october, and in the beggining of this year i realised i needed to stop. After some weak attemps i got desperate, so i tried read the book ""Easyway to stop smoking"". And it was a success, it made me realise so much ideias i got wrong, and almost as a miracle, the next day i didn't needed to smoke anymore. I went from 2 weeks top, with everyday wanting to smoke, to not craving it at all. The moment i extinguish that ""final"" cigarrete, i felt a gret relief and joy (just as the autor said it would).

&#x200B;

The problem was, i smoked again about month later. Basically i was having a small party (just with my house mates) and was drinking alchool, and so, seeing them smoke (one of them only very casually smoking) I had the ""brilliant"" idea that i could just smoke one every now and then (ironically, seeing how the book as 1/2 chapters explaining how there isn't the ""just one ocassionall cigarrete""). After a while, that one (that my friend offered me) turn into wanting another, and another, until one night I felt such a crave that had to go buy a pack for myself, in which i realise I was hooked again.

&#x200B;

So, i did the same thing i did the first time, i re-read the book and estinguish that final cigarrete, and now with the lesson that there isn't just the one ocassional cigarrete, I felt I could finally get this done once and for all.

&#x200B;

Thta until, one month later (now) I got a strong craving, and now I have already bought two packs. And right now, I don't have the same will to stop.

&#x200B;

When at the first real try I just got off with the ""I fell for the stupidest trick of thinking that I could have just one"", now I got the feeling that I will never get ride of it, that if I stop again I will inevitably return one month later. Right now, I feel like I won't be able to stop again, not even for one week.

&#x200B;

I 100% agree with the autor take, that if I go craving it but resisting it for the rest of my life (the will power method) I will me ""miserable"". However, as much as I consciently know that smoking does absolutly nothing for me, I can't stop wanting to smoke 1 month after, it's almost as simple as a nostalgic feeling (wanting to experience smoking again) but at the same time putting me back at square one. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry for the ramble, and thanks for reading. 

TLDR: i sucessfully stop for one month, without cravings, but for some reason after about 1 month after i get strong cravings out of nowhere. And right now I feel like there is no point in trying again, seeing as one month later I will restart again.",6,0

Also, my sinus started clearing. I was feeling so much better at this point. The cough wasn't too bad and I could feel my chest getting lighter and my appetite getting better.

I'm around 25 days now, still casually smoking, I'd go a couple of days without smoking. But still not quitting all the way through. I don't feel too bad though, I'm happy with my progress. Today I lit a couple, and my coughing has got worse.

I told myself I would throw out the rest as soon as I got home, but of course, I didn't and smoked off and on for almost a full 24 hours before throwing the rest out. I got a small nicotine rush at the gas station but honestly mostly it just gave me a huge headache. I expected after being six days nicotine free that I would have been walking on cloud nine or something but it didn't even relax me. It was 90% headache and nausea.  

I feel like I needed that because now I can remember that wimpy, head aching nicotine rush and remember that that's what it'll feel like if I relapse again and not whatever romanticized cloud nine BS I pictured it as. 

I am now 48 hours clean again and this is a ton easier than the first 48 hours last week. I cried nearly half of Day 2 last week and I'm A-OK today. With that failure in mind, it's been easier I think. I think this the time. 

Before what was holding me back was the idea that ""if I got a smoke right now, I would get the *best* nicotine rush because it's been so long"" and now I know that the fabled ""best"" nicotine rush kind of sucks. I can move on from that stupid notion and go forward in a good mindset.

(This post is not advocating relapse. I don‚Äôt advocate shame following a lapse nor do I speak on how to prevent a relapse. They are not my area of expertise! Clearly!)   

Last Sunday I explained I had relapsed and shared the perspective that you can and do continue on with your original stop smoking journey when your dedication and commitment doesn‚Äôt waver. 

Following the relapse I took these steps: 

- Spent a night and day feeling incredibly guilty and disappointed. Of course, hey?? I really want to say ‚Äúbye ciggies‚Äù and never look back instantly! Disappointment is natural and shouldn‚Äôt be suppressed. Use the above feelings then let them go. 
- to comfort myself I felt the guilt (for me it‚Äôs like burning heat everywhere and a racing heart!) and repeated ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to feel guilty and I‚Äôm not.‚Äù It feels horrid and then it drains off. 
- *IMPORTANT* I understand the ‚Äúfuck it! Might as well now‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just finish the pack‚Äù thoughts are the ADDICTED MIND. When the guilt hits , you‚Äôre back in control and anything after that sounding similar to the above is the nicotine coaxing you back in. You want to Stop smoking after the lapse. You don‚Äôt think ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù because you know how hard it‚Äôs been so far. 
- I shared the relapse and my feelings about it with a close friend. I didn‚Äôt ask for advice or help, just a minute to share. 
- I held myself accountable here 
- I read through my prepared list of reasons why I smoke and the reasons I have quit.
- I read through my notes of why I am glad I am a non-smoker and my other notes on how far I‚Äôve gone in order to obtain a cigarette. (Left dates early, been ill) 
- I recommitted to my quit (I didn‚Äôt have any cigs or lighters but if I did, it‚Äôs at this point I‚Äôd have thrown them out) 
- I stayed away from shops selling cigs 
- I‚Äôve stayed away from other smokers wherever possible. 
- I have repeated these two phrases over and over again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke‚Äù and ‚Äúnot another puff, no matter what.‚Äù 
- I pretend someone is offering me a cigarette and I practice different tones until I find the most natural ‚ÄúNo thank you. I don‚Äôt smoke.‚Äù 
- I identified my trigger. It was the expectation of others that I would smoke over that weekend that led me to just ‚Äúget it over with‚Äù and smoke. 
- I am working on the above and what it means to me to hang out with the same friends as a different person‚Ä¶. Tricky! 

The last thing I am doing is NOT smoking. I lapsed, felt it, took accountability, understood all the work I gave myself and the danger I put myself in, forgave, followed the above steps and continue on with my quit. 

I have continued counting my days as I would have with and without a lapse. It happened, It‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôre ok. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª If you are dedicated to stopping smoking and do the above, or another method, you are on your original journey to becoming SmokeFree for good.",5,0

I've tried to quit a couple of times but it, obviously, didn't stick since I'm making this post. 

I want to give some tips that helped and ask for help in some situations that I struggle with. 

Some of the tips given might seem simple but it never hurts to have them. 

My own tips:
- Drink water, duh, the headaches are mean sumbitches.

- Find a snack you can munch on. Smoking inhibits hunger and that'll come back with a vengeance in the beginning + the snack will also keep your hands busy.

- Still have half a pack or so lying around thinking ""Well I'm not gonna waste them, I'll quit after this pack""? . No. Toss it. Stop now. 

- Stay away from alcohol and coffee(again duh). Those are definitely triggers for me and most people I know. 

- Remember when you're quitting that you've just made an enemy: your brain is stubborn asshole and it wants that sweet awful nicotine so remember to tell yourself ""My brain is a stupid four year old who doesn't know what's best for it"" 

- For me personally I would say to drop the counting apps after two or so weeks. It can make it feel like a countdown, where a very mean four year old will tell you ""well its been so and so long ago, it probably won't hurt to have just one"" 

- Stop completely. None of that ""Oh I'll just have one to keep from going crazy"", ""Hey I'm celebrating something or other"". Again, your brain is a sneaky four year old so don't give in to that logic.  

- Now my top tip as a serial procrastinator that helped me through the first weeks last time: weaponize your procrastination! I kept telling myself ""Right now it would take more effort to get up and get a cigarette than it would to stay put"" and things along those lines.  

Now I need some help.

- I'm very introverted and I usually go have a smoke just to get away from people and clear my head and recharge. I feel like it's rude to just leave a gathering for no apparent reason so how do you guys do it? 

- I have ADHD and, again, sometimes I just need to break off and clear my head when working on a problem. So what do you guys do to clear your head? 

- I started at a somewhat early age so the way I usually made friends were by bonding over a cigarette. So basically: how does one keep small talk going?

- Any good suggestions on snacks? I like savoury stuff and not too worried about the health aspect.

- How do I keep my hands busy? I've tried with clicking/holding a pen/snapping my fingers which, for some reason, has a tendency to annoy people. Snacking helps a bit but at some point I do get full. 

- I can never really seem to get the right mindset of ""smoking is gross"" to stick. I've made it to where smoking tastes awful and stinks like crazy but I know it'll get better if I keep going. 

- Any other tips on preparing for quitting is also very welcome.",2,0

334,2021-08-17 23:59:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p6jn55/i_quit/,I quit.,"Hello community. I‚Äôve joined Reddit just for this forum. I‚Äôve been told a quitting forum helps a great deal. Here‚Äôs my quitting reason:

My mom has stage 4 breast cancer and I‚Äôm joining her on a beautiful week away in the magdalen islands (Atlantic Canada).

Do you know what my pressing thought has been? 

¬´¬†It will be difficult and unbearable to find ways to smoke.¬†I will have to constantly delay the next smoke.¬ª 

Given my mom‚Äôs serious illness, it‚Äôs no surprise that it deeply upsets her that I smoke and out of respect and for her health I do not smoke around her, not even outside her property. Plotting how I could find time to smoke in this planned week away together with my ailing mother has dominated my thoughts. It‚Äôs pathetic. It‚Äôs alarming. It couldn‚Äôt be more clear how much this addiction has truly taken control of my free will and ability to enjoy my life to its fullest. 

I am 34 and started smoking late, kind of, at 23. I typically smoke half a pack but with working from home this is increased to sometimes a full pack. 

I went to the pharmacy today and bought patches and gum but I think I‚Äôll try without them. I‚Äôll take them with me in case. But I‚Äôm skeptical - thoughts? 

I‚Äôve rented a bike for the week and will be taking my running shoes. My plan is to literally go run whenever a hard craving hits. I plan on telling my mom once I get there that I‚Äôve quit, and to hold me accountable. She will be beyond happy and I know I can count on the positive encouragement of that. 

I wish I had full faith. I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs the most important part. I don‚Äôt want to smoke anymore. It embarrasses me. It‚Äôs holding me back from the best version I can be. It is ruining me mentally, physically and financially. 

But I want to hold this from an angle of love for myself. For choosing better for myself. I don‚Äôt want to be a nihilist anymore. I want to believe in and love myself to the fullest. 

And with that, I just stubbed my last one.

Thank you for having me! Tips more than welcome! <3",5,0

I successfully managed to get through day two. It was much easier than day one. The nicotine receptors were indeed screaming at me and it felt like my lungs were itching from the inside, but I just ignored it and it kinda just went away on its own. 


That's the part that kinda stuck with me...the best way to deal with cravings or withdrawal signals is just to do absolutely...nothing. You literally just have to let it pass. 


I have noticed that I am a bit more focussed on whatever I am doing because there is no subconscious nagging about when the next smoke break will be. It's pretty strange to just enjoy a moment without thinking about what comes next. 

My sense of smell has slowly started improving too. I have been walking around my apartment sniffing things because it's like a new experience to me.

Over the last year and a half I slowly started to develop problems breathing. I knew I had to stop smoking. It has been a mental battle with myself. Buying cigarettes then throwing them out... Just to buy a pack again all while my breathing issues continued to get worse.

It feels horrible not being able to truly get a deep breath. I have done many tests over this last year and surprisingly after x-rays, spirometry tests and many doctor visits.... The doctors say I am fine and my lungs are functioning as they should. I wish they could put a finger on why I am having such a hard time.....

Regardless if it is smoking related or not I needed to make some serious changes. This last week was the final straw for me. It felt like I switched something on in my head. I am now 3 days free of smoking. 

I feel like shit honestly.... Hard to sleep, aggravated just not a happy camper. All though I know this is just temporary and I will get through it. I feel like I am battling with myself. A test of my strength so to say. 

Quitting smoking is hard... but I feel this time I wont be going back.

I feel the need to write that down for now, just for my self. Maybe i will even help some of you with your own extreme situations, that you will (maybe, but not hopefully) have through your abstinence. 

I was sitting on my couch, watching TV and drinking a beer (most likely the trigger). And suddenly it hit me. I have an ashtray on my balcony that was used by friends some days ago and i really, really was thinking about lightning up one of the half leftover cigs! Actually i even considered buying a new pack, if necessary. 
I have a friend who i am currently supporting with her therapy and her own ongoing withdrawal.
I was clever enough to not further thing about it and just text her, that i am on the edge to have a relapse. She immediately gave me a call and we talked for a while.
After that, i ripped everything in the ashtray apart, that was kind of still usable and threw it away. This was just some minutes ago and i send her a picture as proof. 
Damn. This was really heavy. I fucking cried. Not over the cigs, but the emotional stress! But this showed me one thing: It is really essential to have someone, who knows about the struggle you are going through and will help you through that damn time.

And the reaction to first give this person a call and think about the situation in second place saved my ass, too. If i would have tried to manage this situation by my self, i am pretty, pretty sure, i would have talked myself into smoking ‚Äûjust this one cig this only time‚Äú secretly. And this would have ruined my run for me, guaranteed, and had me thrown back fully into my addiction!

So much love for my good friend, at this point! You really are a great help and we make a good team supporting each other in this vulnerable and weak times! ‚ù§Ô∏è",10,0

Other than that my dentist started noting serious issues with my gums ( i lied about my habits, they probably knew). My cough was terrible. My moods were tied closely to feeding my addiction and I found myself unable to handle even minor stress without running to get my fill. 

My lungs have finally stopped sounding like darth vader although I still cough up occasional phlem. but no longer the brown I had every 5 minutes for the first week.

Funny other story I decided to reward myself as many places recommend online. Sunday night (before interview day) with a massage and my usual place that has never done anything inappropriate was not available. I found another place that looked like it had good reviews that had a last minute opening-- nope I stumbled upon a happy ending place and walked out 30 minutes in when I started aggressively being propositioned for extra services. I was normal making friendly small talk with the woman, that sure made me stressed out and want to smoke but I resisted that too.

I see a lot of people on here trying to get away from nicotine in any form and though my usage time of nicotine isn‚Äôt ANYWHERE near as long as everyone else I have experienced some rather weird side effects trying to quit so I figured I‚Äôd share!

I vaped disposable vape‚Äôs like Puff Plus Bars and Hyde‚Äôs off and on from April of 2020 to February of 2021 for a combined time of about 6mo and picked up nicotine pouches from ON and ZYN June of 2021 to July 2021 and put them down too. Each time was cold turkey so here was my experience:

Vaping:

Week 1-11

- Massive panic attacks and anxiety about every thing my body felt from my pain from workouts to any little change in my bodies digestion or anything.

- Couldn‚Äôt sleep and kept waking up gasping for air though I could easily breathe, which in hindsight those nights were highly likely brought in by the high level of my nerves.

- Developed bronchitis like I‚Äôve never had before and couldn‚Äôt kick it for months compounded on top of the shortness of breath I felt every single day that scared me to death.

- My chest, neck and shoulder muscles were continuously tense even after massages due to my body expelling the toxins and trying to get itself back to normal which also likely contributed to my shortness of breath.

- I would get into positions where my chest would get so tight and breathing would get so labored that I had to physically lay down for 20min or more just to make it bareable.

- The hardest parts of withdrawal for me were the psychological. I lost my purpose, felt useless, couldn‚Äôt find excitement in anything for months, didn‚Äôt want to go hangout with anyone, etc. 


Nicotine Pouches:

Week 1:

- First 5 days I already knew what to expect since I‚Äôve been through it once so I got the same effects anxiety, irritability loss of purpose, etc.

- My anxiety was fine the first 4 days then from day 4 to day 1 of week 3 I had the terrible anxiety again.

Week 2:

- This time I didn‚Äôt get bronchitis but I did develop post nasal drip for about a week and a half and that in itself causes a host of its own issues.

- Shortness of breath started this week but was more manageable this time since I now had experience with the withdrawals.

- Post Nasal drop caused my throat to swell consistently and keep my shortness of breath more difficult but I knew how to treat it this time so it was more manageable.

Week 3:

- Shortness of breath broke in day 1 of week 3 and has progressively gotten better.

- Anxiety has subsided nearly completely and my purpose is back!


My Findings:

- My major problems have been the shortness of breath and anxiety/loss of purpose but it gets better!

UPDATE 8/19/21
- Breathing is nearly perfect, still have minor constriction in my chest but I do a strenuous circuit training style work out 3 times per week which likely aids that slight discomfort but I‚Äôm breathing smoothly and perfectly fine. My Post Nasal Drip is gone and no longer causing my nostrils to be swollen as well.

I have been smoking for 7 years, initially a few cigarettes in the first year, then half a pack ever since. I have tried to stop many times using different tricks - tapes and cold turkey. My longest break without cigarettes was 2 weeks this May when I started using the tapes.

Smoking has taken away too much from me:

1. **I could no longer do sports the way I used to**. I'm an avid runner and I do a P90X training program, however, I could no longer finish my workout without taking multiple breaks. Cigarettes have cut back my lung capacity. I stop to be able to train again.
2. **I gained a sleep disorder called sleep apnea** due to cigarettes. I could no longer get a good night's rest, cigarettes have caused my sleep apnea. I am letting go of smoking to revert my body back to its healthy state.
3. **I drank too much coffee.** I started drinking more and more coffee as I smoked more and more and I became caffeine-addicted. At night I suffered from not being able to fall asleep, not being able to wake up. I am stopping this vicious circle and reducing my caffeine intake. I had enough of artificially increasing the stress hormones in my body to be awake. I let go of cigarettes to build a healthy balance and calmer self.
4. **I built a house of lies.** I got so reliant on cigarettes that I started thinking smoking is what solves my problems. Issues at work? I went for a smoke and everything seemed better. Panic attack? I started smoking. Girlfriend issues? Smoking. I let go of cigarettes because I am ready to face my issues as they arise.
5. **I kept doubting myself.** I could no longer believe in myself. What kind of a person I am,  at the age of 25 I could not even stop smoking, I kept failing. I realized I became very negative when thinking about myself. It reduced my self-confidence and self-esteem. I let go of cigarettes to prove myself that I am not a failure but a success. I never gave up on stopping smoking, I am ready to push through this wall no matter what.
6. **I got panic attacks.** I can't believe what I've become. I'm unstable mentally, seriously dependent on smoking and coffee. I used to not go out because I was afraid of having a panic attack outside. I had backup cigarettes in my backpack for when it happens. Cigarettes were my false medication. I thought I was weak without them. I am letting go of cigarettes because I realized I can fight for my own. I'm strong.
7. **I lost a ton of my energy.** The moment I wake up, my whole mental state was about, when to smoke, where can I smoke, when can I smoke. Having these urges and needs - I can't believe how much effort and energy was taken away from me. It's like darkness in your mind, a closed room full of smoke where you can barely breathe. I let go of cigarettes to gain back my good mood and energy.

In the past 2 weeks, in preparation for August 17, I have started to set up a schedule in my calendar. I believe stopping smoking is life-changing and I wanted to change for the better.

I set up an action plan for each day that includes:

1. **Running/cycling/walking outside**, something in nature! :)
2. **Drinking lots and lots of wate**r, I replaced coffee with Mate tea and Green tea, if I drink coffee I don't drink Mate tea (it has caffeine) and the max coffee I drink is 2 cups but never after 4 PM! :)
3. **I started doing P90X again** an intense workout that really pushes you to the edge. I feel so much stronger and so much more fit already! :)
4. **I started cooking and washing the dishes** every day. I feel useful, clean, and tidy on the outside as well! :)
5. **I started studying about what interests me** for an hour each day after work. I picked up books on various topics; health/vegan foods and programming, math, and other things I used to not be good at! :)
6. **I switched to a less stressful job.** I feel a lot calmer, a lot more balanced and I feel like a success! :)
7. **I started making music.** I bought a piano and I started recording some Lo-Fi tunes! :)  


>I got used to my new schedule. I am building a healthy ""mind + body + soul"".

When I was a kid, my grandfather was smoking and I always asked him, *""Papa, why can't you just stop? You just don't smoke anymore and that's how you stop, you know papa? I can help, give me the cigarette and I will throw it out for you!""*. He took the cigarette out of my hands and smoked another one and a few years later he passed away. I was a very little kid at the time and I remember it clearly. That little kid that I used to be, deserves to have ""himself"".

It‚Äôs been a terrible cycle because as soon as I pick it up again, I start kind of slow and then within a couple days i‚Äôm vaping more than I was before. I just posted on here that I was quitting maybe 5 or 6 days ago and I have already failed and was back to a vape in 36 hours. 

I picked up some patches at Walgreens yesterday and got the 14 mg and 7 mg ones. I know using the patches isn‚Äôt as good as just quitting cold turkey, but after doing that so many times and not being able to do it, I need to try something else. For me, I hate hate hate hitting the vape, I get no enjoyment from it whatsoever and every time I hit it, I just hate it! But I can‚Äôt stop doing it, I need something to get me through that initial wave to just stop hitting the vape all together, even I still have nicotine in my system. So I got the patches and I didn‚Äôt use any of them yesterday, but I put one on today and I am shocked. I didn‚Äôt crave hitting my vape at all today! I‚Äôm a hospice worker so I go to different nursing homes in the area throughout the day and usually by the time i‚Äôm finishing at one home i‚Äôm thinking about how I can‚Äôt wait to get to my car and vape and today I didn‚Äôt. I did hit my vape some, it‚Äôs got the tiniest bit of juice left in the pod but I didn‚Äôt have the desire too, I think I just did because it was right there and out of reflex.

I‚Äôm not going to wear the patches for a full 24 hours, I plan on taking it off before bed and putting a new one on the next morning. So probably 14-16 hours of it being on. I am feeling very hopeful right now, if I can continue this, I think I have a really good shot. In the past when I‚Äôve quit for even just a few days after a little bit hitting the vape just seemed so disgusting, but I always went right back to it before I really got over it. Even this last time I quit, I think I didn‚Äôt vape from like a saturday night to Monday morning and when I was hitting it on Monday I just wanted to gag, but I kept doing it until I was finally used to it again. If I can use these nicotine patches and not vape for 4 weeks? I feel like it is going to really strengthen my chance of quitting.

My bf vapes too and that was a big trigger, I could kind handle it at work alone, but when I got home and I just *knew* he had it on him I couldn‚Äôt help it. And tonight when he got home I didn‚Äôt give a fuck about his vape, didn‚Äôt think about hitting it once, honesty can‚Äôt even remember him hitting it because I just paid no attention to it. I hope things continue to get better, I have to quit. It‚Äôs causing so many health problems and I‚Äôm only 21, it‚Äôs time. Thanks for reading this far.

Recently followed this subreddit (relatively new to reddit). Its given me big inspo. I got trashed this weekend and it's made me rethink a lot about my life. Smoking is one of those. 10 years, 15 a day on average. Today is the first day I've not had a smoke in probably 4 years. Don't have anyone irl to tell about this, so thought I'd post. Finally have someone I want to impress, and however much people say they don't mind, when people smell of smoke it's not nice.

So here we go. I'm dreading the morning.

383,2021-08-16 16:24:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p5obl2/abstinence/,Abstinence,"So I guess I should start with a bit of context. I'm a 29 year old male. Been smoking weed and cigarettes since I was 16. Pretty much around 15 cigs to a pack every day. Also an enormous amount of weed from the moment I wake up and thru the day. I grow my own weed so I always have unlimited stash. Same with cigarettes, I used to buy 10 pack at the time so I didn't have to go back to the store every day. 

I've been battling with anxiety my whole adult life and it comes and goes every few years depending on what's going on with my life. 5 months ago my girlfriend of 7 years told me she wanted to move out to work on her. Been loving together for 5 years at this point. This immediately threw me into crisis mode and I think I smoked way more weed and cigs since then. Anxiety came back and the last few weeks I've been getting paranoid and super uncomfortable when I'm high (takes a couple of joints at least) and more recently cigs made me extra anxious and made me feel all kind of uncomfortable sensations in my whole body

So 3 weeks ago I had a pretty stressfull day and I didn't really ate anything the whole day and I didn't smoked any weed. But tons of cigs. Around 8pm at night I went to my gfs apartment and I felt like I could finally relax so I smoked a joint. Order tacos and ate too much. After I made another joint and I found myself with a joint in one hand and a THC vape pen in the other. 

I suddenly realized I was not feeling good so I put down the weed and tried to calm down. I was so dizzy and felt like I had a fever. I threw up like 4 times. Every time I just drink some water and back up it came until I was completely empty. But the bad feelings remained. I tried to sleep and when I woke up I was felling exactly the same. At that moment I stoped smoking both weed and cigs and tried to eat ""healthy"" things like boiled chicken and carrots. The cold/hot rushes didn't stopped. Two days later I was feeling like I was dying so I went to a lab to get my blood tested. Turns out I had a nasty bacteria in my gut. Proteux. also realized I've been having fever and that could have cause many of the sensations and hallucinations. Doc gave me a bunch of antibiotics and I took several rounds over the next two weeks. 

So back to the cigs. After 5 days of antibiotics and starting to eat again I felt like I was brought back to life. But I didn't went back to smoking. So right now I've been off the cigarettes and weed for 3 whole weeks. Very rarely I get a cigarette craving. My gf smokes like two a day I every time I see my dad he's puffin on a cig. It doesn't trigger any cravings at all. It's more like a mental image or a memory of how much I used to enjoy smoking but I ready don't feel like I want to.

But it's not all rainbows because the horrible sensations have stayed on and off every day. I get a couple of hours of super intense anxiety and felling like I want to cry but I can't. I find myself obsessing about things that make me worried or anxious and the hot/cold rushes overwhelm me and I don't know what to do. Usually they dissipate after an hour or two or sometimes I try to relax and take a nap because sleeping helps and when I wake up I feel different. The last few days I've been having very anxious Time in the mornings and they're gone by noon.

At no point during this crisis episodes I think about smoking. Just the idea of getting high (even the small high of a cigarette) makes me dizzy and want to throw up. Is this the abstinence? Do other people have this episodes of anxiety but dont even want to smoke?

I'm very confused about my whole situation because I had the anxiety before I stopped smoking but it was very different. Much more mild and maneagable. It didnt come and go like now. Used to be pretty consistent throughout the day. Anyway just wanted to share my experience and ask how is the abstinence for you? I'm i confusing my everyday anxiety with abstinence?

Bottom line: you'll be significantly healthier if you bite the bullet and stop doing both","**TL;DR: ""Which is safer"" debates are fair if we** ***need*** **to do something, like take a life-saving prescription. But when we have a choice, however hard the choice is to make, the debate is a distraction. Quitting vaping will dramatically reduce the amount of time you're sick, and that's just the beginning of the benefits. We're talking month-long sinus infections down to two** ***days*** **in my case. I know it's easier said than done, but it can be. Start today.**

I'm like, I imagine, everyone in this entire group: we all started vaping or smoking for different reasons, all now want to stop, and all deal with the horrible consequences of allowing an addiction to take over our lives to the extent that any kind of nicotine inhalation inevitably does. **We're all human, and we all look for excuses that justify the inappropriate or questionable things we do.** So, for example, many of us who vaped or have probably justify or justified it by saying that it's safer. 

Whether vaping is overall safer or not is less relevant than the unavoidable truth that **vaping is still a serious detriment to your health, most importantly in respiratory immune response, at least in my experience.** 

What do I mean? Let me take you back to 2015, when a much-younger version of myself was still vaping like a chimney. I was still caught up in the belief that vaping was somehow better or safer than smoking. A friend of mine and I were chatting outside my workplace one day as I finished up a shift, and **I was puffing on my vape while complaining that I hadn't been able to kick a sinus infection for close to a month. Sound familiar?**

My friend told me that he had read a lot of testimonials and heard from a lot of vaper friends that vaping dramatically increases the length of a sinus infection, even worse than smoking. ""Bullshit,"" I laughed. ""I mean, **I know they're both bad for sinuses and sinus infections, but smoking's** ***gotta*** **be worse, right?"" Wrong.** 

I'm very, very happy to say I finally kicked all nicotine products (using patches, if you're curious; they totally work, used properly!) and then recently got my first sinus infection since quitting. **Less than two months out from quitting nicotine/vaping, the average length of my sinus/respiratory symptoms went down from 3-4 weeks to** ***2 days*****. I came down with a sinus infection Friday, had a terrible time Friday and Saturday, had a slightly off day Sunday (yesterday), and feel absolutely fine today.**",17,7

I was pretty impressed and asked him how he managed to overcome the cravings and urges to light up, and he simply replied ‚Äúif your brain works properly, there will never be any cravings‚Äù. This got me thinking. Maybe even before actually commuting to such a drastic change in our lifestyles we should take some time to properly prepare mentally. While it sounds like a perfect excuse to put off smoking, I think if done properly and with actual intention to stop, it could pay off greatly in battling the addiction before we have even started to quit.

Hey all, 

I stopped smoking 4 months and roughly 20 days ago. Last month I had a relapse, which I really enjoyed, followed by a long night of comforting my own guilt and shame (it‚Äôs ok to be guilty AND I am not guilty) followed by a morning of waking up and feeling ok that this happened and knowing that I am committed to stopping smoking AND I am still on my original quit. 

No ongoing punishment, no ‚Äòfailures‚Äô. 

Relapses happen well before we actually do the lighting up. Loved ones may say ‚Äúwhy did you actually light it?!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt you put it down at that point, it wasn‚Äôt too late!‚Äù 

Yes, it was. By the time the ciggie is in your mouth your relapse has been well underway for quite sometime and that‚Äôs ok!! 

This past weekend I had many events with my smoker friend and I knew I was going to smoke. Rather‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ the lapse was well underway from booking the event, over 2 months ago. 

The only process (I have found) once you‚Äôve smoked, is to wake up the next day, accept that it‚Äôs ok to be guilty and understand that you are NOT guilty. 

I am still on my original stopping journey which has included 2 lapses (so far). I have not wavered in my commitment. I have an addiction and I cannot demand such instant results from myself and neither can you. 

I chose to stop smoking for me and I choose to look after myself through that process as I am the only person who will every truly understand what this journey has been like for me. 

Following the lapse, these next few days will require me to take extra care around smokers and shops selling cigs, self compassion (accepting it‚Äôs ok to feel X and knowing we are wonderful) and the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke‚Äù over and over again. 

Anyway, if you are struggling with the after-shame of a relapse, I hope this offers a different perspective for you.

Yesterday afternoon I felt anxious, but I can't say I had a craving. Today, after around noon, is day two, and I feel myself more under assault now. My brain is basically always telling me to get smoking. I think about smoking without realizing I think about smoking. There's a void there where I have to get the cigarettes, look around for the cigarettes, feel in my pockets for a cigarette. After lunch today I dumbly picked up a lighter without thinking about it. I was holding the lighter and thought, ""why did I - oh...."". My body automatically went for a smoke without even conscious thought. That's how much of a habit it is. 

Physical symptoms are a slight headache, a little agitation and tenseness, but nothing worse than, say, a mild hangover. It's the thoughts that are the trouble. I'm trying to stay away from ***that*** state of mind. Maybe you know what ***that*** state of mind is, if you've ever tried to quit things like drinking, weed or smoking. 

You know that state of mind you're in when you've decided you don't care what happens, and you're just gonna go do the thing you're trying not to do, and there's nothing short of a hurricane that could stop you? Every addict knows that feeling. I call it the ""event horizon"" because after you cross it, you can't go back. 

I know that state of mind is hiding somewhere and I don't want to step too close to it for these first days. Just gotta be strong and keep repeating to myself, ""I don't want to smoke"". I really don't. 

I inhaled some smoke through my nose yesterday and it burned so badly I tore up all my cigarettes. I'm smoking my lungs like a side of pork. The smoke was so hot, and caustic that I couldn't believe I was doing that to my lungs. How are they not the consistency of burnt ends at this point? I've been smoking for over a decade, recently at 1.5 packs a day. I've gotta stop barbecuing my lungs, or I *will* get cancer.

Today out of midsummer boredom I decided to reopen the SmokeFree app. I almost forgot I had it installed, I almost forgot all the struggles, I almost forgot that being a smoker was a core part of my life not so long ago. To much surprise the day I quit was 4 years and 4 days ago. That's a lot of time. Four years. For some reason I expected it to be less. I recall when I stopped smoking: **even the idea of being one day without smoking was my worst nightmare. Now I didn't even notice that years have passed.**

If you are struggling, if you are doubting, if you are having a bad day or if you are only thinking about quitting: it gets better. It gets infinitely better and easier. **My life is 100% better as a non smoker**. There isn't even the slightest thing that I miss. I'm active, I'm more energetic, I started to exercise and have a healthy lifestyle, I sleep better, I can concentrate more. I can run, I can take stairs, I can make love, I can do whatever I want without sweating or getting short on breath. I can smell things, I can taste things. I can enjoy movies, the theater, dinners. I can take a long flight without anxiety. I can live without worrying about how many cigarettes I have, where I can buy them and if I can smoke where I am. 

As a smoker you live your life in ""damage control"". You know your health and body is getting daily damage, you know your body is getting worse every day. All attempts to be healthy aren't about getting better, but about mitigating the damage you are doing smoking. When you quit this will change, your approach to wellbeing and self care will be different and extremely more effective. I couldn't run for more than a minute when I stopped smoking (and I was 27). Now even when I don't exercise and spend months on the couch I can still run without issues for 10+ minutes.

My life is better, in retrospect the benefits I had these years thanks to quitting smoking compounded incredibly. It's such a no-brainer: you don't lose anything and you gain so much. And you gain so much by doing nothing! Once your addiction ends and your cravings start to disappear you don't have anything else to do: you will get tons of benefits by doing absolutely nothing and living your daily life as usual. Your life will be better, **you aren't missing or losing anything at all. I promise that**. 

You can do it, **whatever it's your current struggle be aware that it's just temporary**: quitting will get easier and life will be better. 

I haven't craved a cigarette in years. I haven't desired a cigarette in months and the last time I wanted one one was like I wanted anything else: just a thought that you can ignore and dismiss quickly. I used to have the worst craving while quitting, obsessing over the thought of a puff for days. You can read my old posts. I was sure that ""i was different"" and for some reason ""for me it was worse/impossible"". It's bullshit, it will get better, it will get easier. To you too.

One day you will wake up and remember a long time ago when you used to smoke. You will smile thinking how much time has passed and how better your life is. You will smile remembering all the struggles you went through, knowing how much is was worth. Just do it, it gets better.

Need to vent, get support.","I quit back in 2018 after reading Easy Way. I‚Äôd smoked off and on (mostly on) up to almost 2 packs a day. It wasn‚Äôt hard to quit and I didn‚Äôt have any terrible withdrawals with that method unlike with other methods I‚Äôd tried. For some reason, back in the fall of 2020, I accepted a friend‚Äôs offer of a smoke, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to smoke just one. I was so stressed and anxious- election stuff, Covid, life‚Ä¶. Soon I was back to smoking a pack a day. I tried to stop a few times but kept giving in. 

Well, a few weeks ago I decided to listen to the audio version of the same Allen Carr book again. I was about halfway through it, still smoking, when one night my 9 year old walked outside where I was smoking and burst into tears and begged me to stop. I never smoked in front of my kids but it wasn‚Äôt hidden either. This was the first time it had been acknowledged. They knew it was something I was ashamed of because I wouldn‚Äôt do it around them. After that I decided I would quit no matter what. I finished the audiobook and smoked my final one 8 days ago. But this weekend I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôm bored. I‚Äôm lonely. I live in a state with a bunch of uneducated people and Covid is butt fucking my community. My kids‚Äô schools aren‚Äôt even enforcing protective measures. Sometimes the world seems so bleak I don‚Äôt even know why I should care if I get cancer. 

I know a smoke won‚Äôt help but I guess some of the brainwashing is still in effect because the temptation is creeping in again. I didn‚Äôt have any withdrawals for the first week and I doubt there‚Äôs much if any nicotine still in my system at this point, so it‚Äôs all mental. Just needed to put this out there.

I have smoked for almost 30 years and never tried to quit until now. I was up to about 15-20 cigarettes a day as of the last few months.

I would say today, day 5, has hopefully been a turning point in my journey. 

The last 4 days I have had a lot of anxiety about my food choices. The smoking issue kinda faded after 2 days, and it still creeps into my thoughts, but my major fixation since I quit 5 days ago is a fear of gaining weight. I recognise that nicotine suppresses the appetite and smoking kept me busy. I spent so much time smoking! 

I kinda don't know what to do with this free time now, I am just starting to have this routine where I wake up and watch videos on [whyquit.com](https://whyquit.com) with my coffee, instead of the morning chain smoking routine.

&#x200B;

The last few days I have just wanted to stay in bed, feel sorry for myself, moan, cry, and eat junk. I have gained maybe just over one pound since I quit, so that is giving me major anxiety. Through this pity, anxiety, sadness, and isolation, I have slowly discovered my sense of smell, taste, and breathing have dramatically improved in a matter of days!

&#x200B;

Today, I decided that is enough! I finished week 3 of my couch to 5k running program, went swimming, went food shopping for healthy items, and was generally positive! What a contrast to the last 4 days!

&#x200B;

I also quit drinking over 3.5 years ago with so much help from r/stopdrinking. Facing our addictions really helps us to understand why we do these things, and make more sustainable positive choices for our physical and mental health.

Ever since I quit smoking, I've been doing great by staying off cigarettes but I still find myself occasionally, at least once or twice a week. Usually it's when I'm drinking with friends that vape. And sometimes I'd buy a disposable  vape, only to throw it out the next day, which is good but also a waste of money. Other times I'd be hanging out with friends that vape and ask for a few puffs, and honestly it's counterproductive as one puff or few just leads to more, just like with cigarettes. My friends would also give me shit for being a mooch as the reason I wouldn't buy vapes is because I don't wanna be vaping all day, especially at home. This is why cold turkey is the best option for me. 

The weird thing is, I don't have cravings for vapes every day, but when they do, they hit hard. Drinking is a trigger but only when I'm drinking with friends that vape. Otherwise I do just fine. It just get really expensive and in the way of shit as the other day, I was drinking at the bar and on the way I started craving a vape. I was hoping to find just a disposable between $10 and 15 but all I could find was an NJoy starter kit with 2 pods for $50 and used it for a little bit and then threw it out the next day. I've done that many times where I spend $10-20 on a disposable vape, only to throw it out the next day as it does nothing for me and I feel like a lab rat/guinea pig. 

Part of the reason I buy disposable vapes as opposed to the tanks where you refill them is because I don't wanna be vaping all day. It's the same reason I never bought a carton of cigarettes when I smoked as the more you have, the more you use them which makes it harder to quit. 

Anyone else have this issue? Fortunately I haven't had any issues since I threw it out on Thursday, I just wanna not buy vapes to begin with unless it's like CBD where it actually relaxes me.",5,0

I've been smoking for 18 years now, and drinking kinda heavily, I function 100%, I workout everyday, work pay my bills, eat healthy, but smoked 1,5 packs a day, and every night I used to drink 2-3 tallboys, my wife would drink with me every night as we made dinner, but she started a diet and stoped a month ago because she was decided to get ripped for summer, almost every weekend we would barbecue and get drunk.

I have been trying to stop smoking from time to time for the last 6 years, I would always get drunk and smoke 1 cig at a party or something, then smoke hidden from my wife and daughter, and then pick up smoking all over again. The last 3 years I've stated that I was not ready to stop, and just kept smoking fiercely.

Most of my friends don't smoke and/or hate smoking, everytime we do something togheter, I would go outside to drink and smoke by myself while my wife and our friends would be inside having fun. I got to a stage that I would download a podcast everytime we get togheter, so I would be outside smoking and drinking while listening to podcasts, while my friends are inside the house having fun.

The combination made me realize that I was becoming really antisocial, and worse, kinda of harshly critical of other for not sharing my crazy obssession for podcasts and/or accomodating my addiction in their lifes. I believe I was going through depression, I'm really extroverted so for everybody else everything was dandy, but I could not spend one day without getting hammered.

11 days ago, I was at a barbecue, got drunk as fuck, smoke almost 3 packs outside, by myself, it was 2¬∫C (35¬∫F) and raining outside... So I woke up the next day, went on a run, got back home, made breakfast for my wife and daughter, some coffee for me, smoked the last 2 cigs I got in a pack, and decided to quit, both drinking and smoking.

It was brutal, but for some reason, I was feeling different, I didn't change a thing in my routine, but I was managing the impulses to buy cigs or beer, things that in the past was really hard.

As I quit, I've started training to run a marathon in november, I figured that would help me with ansiety and shit like that,  so I started weighing myself every morning to monitor my weight and get in running shape.

2 days ago my wife saw me weighing myself and weighted herself and got pissed, because she was in a diet for a month and gained 4 pounds.

I said to her to go to the doctor and check if she was not pregnant, and she is.

That's crazy, I'm super happy, and I'm mindboggled by how the brain works, because I'm sure the fact she is pregnant somehow made me quit smoking, this time around it's being really easy, theses first 10 days was my easiest, my stress levels are alright, I miss smoking here and there, but nothing overwhelming. And with this fantastic new reason to quit. I'm 100% focused and sure that I'm done with that.

My diet leaves a lot to to be desired. When I'm at home I can cook well enough but my big issue is I work part time at a McDonalds, so three days a week I'm in there eating a burger or a mcmuffin and it never seems to affect me. But there used to be a guy who worked here who was in fantastic shape who never ever ate the lunch here,he always brought in his own,I asked him why and he said it was just making him feel bad. 

Even now the food here never seems to make me feel bad and when I take my holidays and I'm not eating fast food for a few weeks I don't feel much different.

Today, I want to tell you how it's going. I don't really know what I'm expecting from this post, I just wanted to share some of my experiences.

One important fact I din't tell y'all about before is that I was a daily weed smoker, and around here we roll joints with tobacco. that didn't exactly make quitting easier.

So at the very start of this odissey, i decided to quit smoking altogether. weed and tobacco. that went well for a couple days, then i smoked a joint (with tobacco) with my roommate and smoked a cig again the other day because nicotine was on my mind again. i stopped smoking again, and started smoking yet another time a few days later. 

i could go on like this for ages, but i'll just say: this bullshit has basically been my life up until now. 

i quit for a few days, i smoke for a few days.

a small archievement lately is that i've almost exclusively been smoking joints. just a cig like every 5-7 days or so.

thing is, i'm starting a new job in 10 days and i'm gonna stop smoking weed altogether by then. i hope that i'm gonna be able to just stop smoking altogether but i'm afraid the cigs are gonna come back into my life 

TL;DR: i complain about not really being able to stop in a post that became way too long

First time poster here, so forgive me if this community is more about support and less about advice but I could really use some. I‚Äôve been smoking off and on since I was about 15 (31 now) with the only off period being 4 years smoke free about 5 years ago. The last time I quit it was one of the hardest things I had ever done, which is causing me to really dread it this time around party because I know what‚Äôs coming but also because I feel 10000% more addicted/dependent on them now. When I started smoking I was young and had undiagnosed anxiety and ocd. Smoking made me feel a sense of control and relaxation. Now I‚Äôm much older and I take medication and have a therapist and psychiatrist and so I have tools in my toolbox to deal, but unfortunately those cigs are still the biggest crutch for all kinds of things in life as all addictions are I suppose. I know the nicotine is a huge factor, but tbh the sheer habit feels like it‚Äôll be the biggest hurtle for me (it was the last time around. I was able to kick the Nicolette gum after about a week.) at this point in my life cigarettes feel like an extra limb and I can‚Äôt fathom a life without that limb. What do care rides look like, what does drinking coffee look like, sitting in the porch, relaxing after a big meal etc. it feels so much bigger than just the addiction to nicotine it feels like a major part of my life. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs anyone out there who identifies with this I‚Äôd really love to know how you quit, what worked for you vs what didn‚Äôt.

Just learn to pin all those withdrawal feelings and emotions on the real culprit, nicotine, learn to hate it and it's easy to quit once you make it past 4 or 5 days.

I have been smoking for a good 40 years, on and off but mostly on and in the past 3-4 years started smoking at least a pack a day, usually more and just had enough.  I have to admit my body was not happy with me and I've had all SORTS of things to get past, although a lot of that is surely due to drastically changing my diet for the better, an insane increase in drinking that I've changed to an insane decrease in drinking.

And stress stress stress at job and life.  My GF refuses to get a covid vax, NOT POLITICAL, not dumb, she believes in all the mask rules and staying home, and it must be some phobia.  She smokes like a chimney and I'm scared shitless her 28 year old idiot son (Won't get vaxxed, don't start me on HIM) will bring Covid Delta home to her and kill her.  I only bring that up as a source of major stress and major anxiety and will not entertain any discussion on it.  I will say I got vaxxed at literally my very first chance and don't care to hear any opinions on the matter - this is a stop smoking sub, not one of the many argue vax/politics subs.  I digress.

I had insane anxiety beyond that  (quitting will do that).  And paralyzing depression.  The head fog, oh my farkin God (it *started* leaving for real at the end of week 4 and is all but gone now).  

My metabolism and digestive tract went bonkers and is finally calming down (hooray for ground psyllium husk and high fiber foods lol).  My weight went up about 10 pounds until I curtailed the crap food as well as the excessive beer.  Just weighed myself and I've LOST 10 pounds since I first quit and I'd bet at east half of that was due to stress.  And let me tell you, tomato and ""power greens"" sandwiches (with mayo and fresh ground pepper) are food of the Gods and I've resurrected my lost love of salads.  

The good parts are I've discovered smoking made me lazy - it was easier to have a smoke and chill out than it was to get things done that needed to get done (think home repairs, among other things).  I'm hyper now, perhaps energetic is a better word, but then again I was pretty energetic before I ever smoked and the same way any time I had quit (reminds me of when I quit during high school and experienced the same).  When I cut my lawn I may be breathing heavy by the end but my GOD the energy I have when doing it and other yard work.  

When it's time for bed I used to read for a good hour or two until I got drowsy and now I can get to sleep within minutes and at almost any time of day I want to (helloooo power naps).

Anyhow, that's my 50 day rant.  I'm *almost* surprised I made it but not really.  Once you're in the right frame of mind to quit - and learn nicotine is the CAUSE of withdrawal and not the solution, learn to F\*\*\*ING HATE IT AND BLAME IT ALL ON IT - it's really not too hard.",29,3

Getting my parents to stop is not an option, or getting them to smoke out side. My step dad is smoking pretty much 24/7 while my mother does it quite often too. 

All my belongings smell like smoke, and I always have a smoke taste. For awhile, anything that I ate tasted like smoke, and literally everything in the house smells like smoke. It was so bad when my senses were screwing with me, even shower water smelt like smoke. 

Inside the car, luckily I can convince my mom not to smoke in it, but I know I won't be able to convince my step dad.

It felt like I was a failure every time. 11 years of smoking and almost 2 years of vaping. Still beholden to nicotine, though vaping helped me step down the levels.

Well you know what? Those were preparations for experience, and when I finally wanted to quit, I was able to let go. But it was by no means easy.

In the first few days I still had strong willpower to quit. I fought off cravings, got pissed off, and went about my business while allowing myself to feast on food as a distraction. This, of course, led to weight gain. But that wasn't the worst.

After about a week or two, the psychological aspects revved in. I would get bored, and have to actively fight my subconscious need to puff on something. I was constantly antsy. Everything pissed me off all the time. I couldn't concentrate on anything at all.

More weeks passed by. Lots more anger. Lots more frustrating days. There were days it felt like the inside of my skin was trying to rip itself out very slowly, every passing minute at times. Other days I wouldn't even think about it.

2 months in I was fairly depressed. I kept having mood swings, extremely bad brain fog, and otherwise felt out of whack. The gum bleeding stopped by this point.

Around 3-4 months I stopped having intense cravings or symptoms, and more frequently forget I was ever a smoker. It became more of a past memory than a habit I'm trying to shake off.

The brain fog didn't seem to clear up until 6-8 months after quitting, though. Past that I'd go 5-10 days at a time without even thinking about how long it had been since I smoked; it was rarely on my mind.

I gained up to 40 pounds but half managed to drop off half of it and keep off that half, and slowly burning through the rest of my gained weight. My gums are healthier than I've ever known them to be in my adult life, and everything tastes and smells so pure.

That being said, I am NOT the smoker i am writing about, but my girlfriend has been smoking since she was 16 She is now 22 and smokes about a pack a day. Before i get into specifics, I want to say that I am making this post in support of my awesome SO, and I am not pushing her to quit. I have told her that i would rather if she didn‚Äôt smoke but I want her decision to quit to be HER decision, not mine. I support her decision to quit if she chooses, but I promised not to make her feel bad for smoking after initially stating my opinion against it. 

So with that being said, she is in the middle of her 4th attempt of quitting since i have been with her. So far, she is has adopted the approach of vaping. After she decided that she hated vaping, she is now trying to ONLY smoke 5 cigs a day and she expects to cut back over time. Since she began this method, this has been making her increasingly irritable and upset when she smokes her 5 for the day and wants more. the cycles of quitting has put a bit of strain on our relationship but I am trying to find a balance of being supportive and overstepping. Quitting an addiction needs to be a personal decision, and i don‚Äôt want her to feel like i forced her to quit, but at the same time, she needs me to micro manage her cigarette count because she cannot trust herself to do it. 

So i having said that, here are my questions!
1. To anyone who has quit smoking, could you possibly give me some advise for being supportive without overstepping in her journey of quitting? she is awesome and I only want what is best for her, and i can see that she truly wants to stop but she is struggling.

2. any advise to my girlfriend? She isn‚Äôt big on reddit, but i figured her seeing the testimonials of others who have quit would give her a bit of encouragement and help her not feel as alone. Also, do you have any opinions of quitting cold turkey vs what she is doing, which is slowly reducing the number of cigs she smokes per day. I feel like this method is drawing out the quitting process and making her suffer more than she has to. While cold turkey would be a faster process and help her get on with the recovery from the withdrawal. Thanks everyone!",4,0

Spent the 2 week vacation chain smoking, absolutely hating it the entire time and just before flying back home gave him the remainder of my pack and quit again. And I have to say, luckily, this second quit has been so much easier than the first one, probably because I hadn't yet picked up my old smoking habits back home again.

 I still have multiple cravings a day, I'm about 20 pounds heavier than I was 100 days ago and I'm horribly bloated and farting all day long but I have to say... I feel good.

I really don't think I would have lasted if it wasn't for this group.

I am a professional actor and since quitting I have played two film roles where smoking was required. I made it clear that I will not consume tobacco or nicotine in any capacity and both productions obliged by providing herbal alternatives. 

One thing you should know is that smoking on film is a whole process. Two minutes of someone smoking on screen probably meant eight hours of filming and at least a dozen cigarettes to get those two minutes. 

When I smoked those cigarettes all day, I did not enjoy the taste; I did not enjoy the motion of bringing the lit cigarette to my lips and inhaling. I was just reminded of how I used to feel all the time while smoking. Remember those cigarettes where you felt like shit, and you almost couldn't even finish it, but you did anyway? That was it. 

I just realized that it's all about the nicotine. I am addicted to the drug of nicotine. I am so glad I quit cold turkey.

Being a typical teenager I told her that the nicotine didn‚Äôt even effect me, that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 4 years later i‚Äôm still using nicotine, I‚Äôve switched on and off throughout the years. I‚Äôve never quit for more than a couple weeks since I started. A year ago I switched to using a Vuse Alto & since then I‚Äôve had terrible trouble with shortness of breathe, a lot of mucus production, and most recently - chest pain. I switched the cigarettes for a little bit thinking it was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù trying to somehow rationalize it. After a couple weeks I was up to 6-7 cigarettes a day, so I switched back to the vape. I know this is caused by the alto because when I stop for even a day or two, it all gets immensely better. 

I work in health care, I know what it does to your body. I see COPD patients that are still smoking a pack of day and slowly killing themselves at 50-60 years old.

After smoking basically every day for 8 years since I was 15, it was honestly something I did not think I could ever do. Not only was I physiologically addicted but I was also incredibly psychologically dependent on cigarettes. They were a coping mechanism, a way to relax, a way to calm myself and ease anxiety, a way to get over things, a way to process, yet also a way to reward myself, a way to celebrate. 

Every single task was framed by cigarettes, every journey requiring one before and after.

Felt like sharing because I am proud of myself today for keeping this promise to myself, and for allowing myself a healthier life and a mental freedom which I am so grateful for. 

As I said, it‚Äôs not something I ever thought I could do. Both my parents smoke and still smoke, it is something I am still around. You can do it too. 

P.S. a special thanks to the Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr, which helped me enormously. I devoured it in two and a half days, stuck to it and kept my promise. Another massive thing which helped me was getting into yoga (a lot of yoga with Adriene videos) and being in a hermit hole during lockdown where I could be cranky and alone. Also thanks to my partner who has always been incredibly supportive and understanding of me.",194,1

I‚Äôve never smoked. 

About a year ago, I walked in on him blowing a cloud of smoke and I quickly asked what that was, and he had no choice but to show me a vape pen in his hand. He said he‚Äôd been stressed at work lately and saw other people using them so he decided to give it a try to help with cravings he‚Äôs been having lately. 

He said it was no big deal and destroyed the vape pen. In the following months, I found him passed out in the living room in the middle of the night with a new vape pan beside him. Each time, he‚Äôs destroyed it and claimed he didn‚Äôt have a problem.

I‚Äôve asked how I can help. We are in couples counseling and have come up with some things for him to try - I‚Äôve bought him baby carrots to munch on instead, I‚Äôve bought licorice root sticks that I thought were helping since he‚Äôs always chewing on them, I‚Äôve asked if he needs Nicorette or something but he says no, I‚Äôve given him the 1-800-QUIT-NOW number, I gave him the link to the QuitSure app, etc. He had told our counselor that he would lean on me more for support instead of trying to handle this on his own, but that hasn‚Äôt been the case.

A week ago, I walked in on him puffing again. After that, he finally called the 1-800 number and I guess they said they‚Äôd send him an email with some resources.

Now I saw him passed out in the living room holding the vape pen again. I‚Äôve told him that if he has a problem, I want to help and at least don‚Äôt want him blowing it in our home where our infant and I are forced to breathe it.

He always swears he‚Äôs not addicted and doesn‚Äôt need help, but apparently he does and won‚Äôt open up to me about it. Any suggestions?",6,0
522,2021-08-11 04:36:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p290gg/how_i_felt_when_i_quit_smoking_weed_after_daily/,"How I felt when I quit smoking weed after daily use for 10 years: heaviness of breath, felt like pressure on my chest, as well as an eternal glob of phlegm at the back of my throat that won't disappear no matter how much I swallow/attempt to hawk it up. **Here's what I've learned","As stated in the title of the post, I experienced a lot of symptoms after quitting weed, which I'd smoked several times a day for years and years. I'm writing this post because I was freaked out at the time, over 5 weeks of thinking I was going to die in my sleep / that I'd never be able to breathe properly again. I had cold sweats, was always clammy, sometimes I'd be raked by shivers, I'd wake up each night in a pool of my own sweat, clothes clinging to my body as if I'd just hopped into a pool fully clothed. And there was also terrible insomnia, couldn't sleep a wink. Lay in bed from midnight until sunrise, tired as can be but not sleeping at all. I want to share what I learned after scouring reddit and the internet, for anyone going through the same.

1. Alter your diet. I followed an acid reflux diet and it really helped to ease the symptoms. No tomatoes/tomato-based sauces, no pizza, no red meats, no overly greasy foods... It sucks at first, but hunger is the best spice and before you know it you'll have made peace with the temporary diet change and you'll even lose a bit of weight / be healthier overall.
2. When you go to bed, either lay flat on your back with a pillow placed beneath your legs so that it's right beneath your knees, OR lay on your LEFT side, with a pillow between your legs to level them off, legs straight. The second option (on side) made my sleeps about 10% better across the board.
3. Get some Benylin Mucus & Phlegm if you can, this stuff worked wonders for me. It thins out your mucus so that eternal glob (which I later learned is called Post-nasal Drip) at the back of your throat thins out and becomes swallowable. After I found this stuff, my sleeps were much more comfortable...well, manageable.
4. Absolutely DO NOT smoke again, it basically resets all your progress. I smoked a little pinner the day after I finally felt better, and it all came back with a vengeance. If you need to smoke, eat edibles and save your lungs / possibly your life.
5. Don't drink alcohol, at least not often (for as long as you're feeling like garbage, don't drink. Don't for two weeks after you feel better, either.
6. Exercise! Even going for a half an hour walk, hell, even twenty minutes, every day for a month, will really help. This will strengthen your lungs a bit, helping them cough up / get rid of / withstand whatever sort of infection that this caused.
7. I eventually took antibiotics, though I sort of regret this as you can only take these a few times in your life before they don't work. It would be a nightmare to use them for this, but then later down the road you get a serious illness that can only be cured with antibiotics and you're stuck because your body is already immune to them.
8. Ask your doctor about anti-bacterial mouthwash, like odan-benzydamine, which I've used to treat similar discomforts to great effect.

I started smoking again about half a year later (genius me) and the sensations sort of came back. If you do want to keep smoking well after you've been healed, then I'd suggest only using joints, or mainly sticking to edibles. Search up firecrackers if you want quick and easy edibles.

All of what I've written here pertains to anyone going through this, even non-smokers. I really hope this helps even one person, because I'd really wished at the time of my sickness/withdrawal/whatever it was, that somebody else that'd gone through the same thing had written about how to deal with it and eventually overcome it. Also, tobasco/hot sauce is a good decongestant if you can't get any Benylin. Your nose will run, and you'll probably cough up some gunk.

Good luck, all!

Edit: Apparently you can take antibiotics more than just a few times, but be sure to look into it because I sure as hell didn't :c",23,2

A bit of a back story. I smoked for 10 years before quitting by substituting with vaping. I vaped for about 3 years when I quit 15 days ago cold turkey.

The physical withdrawls are gone and I don't really have any mental cravings ( my partner hid my vape so I don't have a choice and as a result don't feel the cravings). 

My only issue is the sleeping or should I say lack of. Every single night between 2-4 am I wake up and sometimes can't get back to sleep. On the days I can't get back to sleep I end up getting up at 3-4 am to start my day and feel like crap only for the cycle to repeat again.

I tried sleeping in a seperate bed from my partner last night to eliminate that possibility and still woke up at 3 am. I feel exhausted most days and can't catch up on sleep as I was never a good sleeper to begin with.

Is this a common reaction to nicotine withdrawls? How long did this go on for in your experience / was there anything you did to help stay asleep?

Edit - Also I cut out caffeine after midday and that hasn't changed anything

Seemed great at the time, now some of it's not the best. Like every time I want a cig think of how happy I am to be a nonsmoker? I'm not Happy. I'm not close to happy.

I quit by using the lozenges for a while (probably too long).  Never experienced any withdrawal symptoms when I quit, other than the desire to want nicotine in any form.  A few months ago the lozenges sounded good and I saw them on sale at Costco.  Boy was that a mistake.

Friday about 10 days ago I think I had too many (not sure how many, wasn't counting) and felt achy and blah.  On Saturday I had a sore on my tongue (which may have been caused by it or by biting it accidentally in my sleep).  I scaled way back last week on the lozenges and only had a few a day.  Continued to feel achy and blah all week, even though I was still having a few lozenges spread throughout the day.  I had a half one this past Saturday morning and decided I wanted off of it after I read more about it.  I realized it wasn't the innocent little treat I was pretending it was.  Saturday through now (Tuesday late afternoon) I have felt very achy.  Almost like a mild flu.  I don't feel as bad now, but I'm still pretty achey.  For some reason it's worse in the afternoon.

Everywhere I have read has kinda downplayed being achey as a withdrawal symptom.  And say it should be gone after day 3.  Well, here I am at the end of day 4 still feeling achy.  I deal with pretty bad anxiety, so I tend to go to worse case scenario type situations in my head and overthink things.  If ANYONE is out there who has had a similar experience and can provide some reassuring words, I would be in great debt to you.  I guess I am having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that I have essentially been achy and felt off for a week and a half and only used the lozenges for a few months.

This past November I had covid and I was separated from my SO and I told him I wanted to quit. I had covid and I was smoking and was so ashamed that I was doing it while being sick. This made me stop. I went a whole month and felt empowered as fuck. And then I went down the rabbit hole and haven't been able to get out of it. The past 9 months (omg I've never counted I can't believe it's been that long :( )....I am smoking now and have to leave for work in an hour and am leaving this shit at home and want to be done for good. I hate it, I am a slave to it, I hate everything about it. Words of encouragement would be GREATLY appreciated. I know the first three days are tough and I've made it through for 4 days at the most on and off since I jumped back on and want to leave this behind for good. I know I've done this before but if anyone can provide any insight or advice being on the other side I think it would really help me out, as I've just been lurking this sub for a month or so. I CAN DO IT!",7,2

I just left the emergency room after thinking I was having a heart attack (tight chest, difficulty breathing, sweating profusely, whole nine yards.) I won't go into details about the whole situation (I'm going to be okay), but of course, the first thing I did after being discharged was light up a cigarette because hey, that's what I do, that's the routine. Didn't even think about it. I'm halfway through it and I started having a thought I never had before: ""What am I doing?"" One of the biggest scares of my life happened tonight, and here I am continuing to kill myself like I didn't even learn my lesson. 

So I impulsively pulled over to a gas station, took the rest of the pack (mostly full) along with all my lighters from the car and threw it into the trash. I got home and threw out whatever lighters and ashtrays I could find. Immediately I felt anxious like I accidentally threw out my credit cards or my license or something super important. I'm still feeling anxious writing this post now.

I want to quit so bad but I don't know if I'm strong enough to see it through. I keep thinking about how easy it is to drive to the store and buy a lighter and another pack.

If anyone has any advice for an aspiring new-quitter, any kind of motivation, I could use all the help I can get. Thanks all.",53,0

THE QUESTION: He's been having severe pain in his joints. Quitting has been elevating his blood pressure, which caused the stroke in the first place. Pain in joints is a known side effect of the stroke, and isn't eased by OTC pain relievers. Is pain a side effect of quitting that y'all have seen or experienced? I want to be able to tell him once he gets the toxins of the cigarettes our of his system it'll ease, but I can't say that with any authority.

When I turned 16 I wanted to quit and I managed to go cold turkey for a week but I couldn't go longer than that. That was about the time Juul came out so I ordered one along with pods (which I'm now certain were fakes) off eBay.

They changed the tobacco laws in August of '19 and then atleast in Indiana they gave vape/tobacco shops and gas stations until July 16th of 2020 to update their software for scanning IDs or whatever. I was 19 by that point so I could still get things for myself and I hadn't read the law so I had assumed there would be a grandfather clause so I wasnt concerned (there isn't)

There were several Marathons that would never ID.  So even after the law change I would go in every 2 weeks and buy 2 Mr Fogs and that'd last me 2 weeks. I didn't vape a lot but enough to keep cravings down not healthy but better than cigs.

But as of last week, one got busted for selling alcohol to minors. So now all of them ID which I really can't fault them for. 

I'm now 20 and turn 21 in 5 months. I'm out of options to get disposables.

I was 19 when the law changed and I find it quite stupid that there wasn't a grandfather clause. The really stupid thing is that they just changed the age to purchase. There is no law saying I can't possess or use tobacco products. 

I've tried going cold turkey several times but I have addictive tendencies (I was adopted at birth and my biological mother wasn't the cleanest to put it lightly) and it's practically impossible for me to break a habit once I've started. I don't really know what to do at this point.",2,0

I never really counted but 12 years smoking pot- 10 of which were daily and 9 years smoking tobacco. I am starting to see glimpses of happiness (thats a stretch, more like neutral rather than shitty but feelings are relative so lets call it joy). Also included are sporadic periods of intense nausea, aches, chills however they are less frequent than days 3-5 when it was basically 24-7. I was discussing my previous attempts and why I started smoking with my GF last night and I wanted to share why I think now is different (it has nothing to do with the smoking part). These are the things that would rush to my brain when I would stop and would repeat over and over until I took that puff.

\-I had a really shitting upbringing although I was only hit with the belt enough times to establish fear, the emotional abuse was rough. I always thought I had this special situation that I could ramble for hours of mommy/daddy did this or that. Turns out im not that special. My mom is a narcissist, plain and simply. Straight out of traits ""about section"" of r/raisedbynarcissists there is nothing more to her personality and there never will be. She is a monster and I dont ever plan on visiting, she will never go to my wedding, see my kids, be a physical part of my life- phone calls only. 

\-I accepted that my stepdad is and always will be a big p\*ssy. All of his abuse was driven by weakness and insecurity. I visited after years of NC, and realized he described our relationship as ""best its ever been"" admitted to holding grudges from my behavior as a 7yr old- he called it ""the first major blow to our relationship"". He offered my money to pretend that we were cool for mom, and made it sounds like my intent of driving 9 hrs to visit ""ruin his life"" ""execute a grudge"". F that, I always wanted dads approval but I never will get it. 

\-My stepdads mother (gma) who I hadnt seen in 5+ years was allowed in the country and this was the primary reason I visited. I thought she was a positive influence in my life but unfortunately being older and more inquisitive. In the form of ""i want to make amends, please tell me what I did wrong as a kid to make dad mad"" turns out she seen me as ungrateful, rude, etc. It never occurred to me that a conservative woman like her might see an issue with ""raising a son that wasn't her own blood"" . Cut that person out. I don't need that gaslighting bs. 

\-My (half) siblings, I have always tried to support my siblings and give them the encouragement I felt lacking in. Turns out they see me as a ""difficult one"" who is ungrateful for everything I have been given. I called my little brother to congratulate him on his linkdin profile and his promotion and took substantial time to research his job and interests. Basically I let him brag and tell him how he is the shit. He told me he needed to talk to me about something and I said its a bad time as my gf and I had a ferry to catch. He went on a long talking down rant revealing his true feeling about me. Lots of rude things. Not worth mentioning. Cut that shit out. My little sister is younger and we don't speak as much however she was involved by riling up my little brother by telling him i said X about him, which was completely out of context instead of asking me what I meant. Frankly I don't want to waste my time being surprised that she shares the same feeling. 

\- I met my dads widow, and half sister. Have gotten in touch with my grandpa and am learning more about my bio dad. Always wondered what he was like and stepdad got violently emotional if I ever expressed interest in my bio dad. 

Ive check off all the marks in my book that I can possibly do. There was a time to be sad and cry about those things and puff away and it helped me avoid killing myself during a really rough period. Ill never meet my dad, but this is as close as it gets. I am not wasting emotions on my abusive family and going NC. I know that some of us have pain and stories that got us doing this crap, however universally we just love that feeling. Similar to a really good upvoted post - don't set yourself up for failure. Get the baggage out of the way to the best of your ability. Make quitting solely about your physical addiction rather than setting yourself up for failure by trying to fight too many demons at once.

I‚Äôve read some pretty useless ones and some very effective ones and here are my personal picks from one to three. 

1. Neil Casey - The Nicotine Trick 

This is by far the best book I‚Äôve read on helping smokers to quit. It takes some of the concepts from Allen Carr‚Äôs famous book and expounds on them, making this the best way to understand how the drug nicotine works. The first 2/3 are particularly brilliant. It‚Äôs rare to find these days as the book has been out of print for some time.

2. Jason Vale - Stop smoking in 2 hours 

Jason Vale would have been well known to many as the ‚Äújuicemaster‚Äù in the late 00‚Äôs, especially those in the UK. The method in the app doesn‚Äôt differ much from Carr‚Äôs but it‚Äôs relatable and can be easily sat through in 2 hours. Sadly, Apple have delisted it from the App Store making it hard to come by and for those who bought it in the past, like me, are shit out luck too as the app is not compatible with later iOS. F you Apple. 

3. Allen Carr - Easyway 

It‚Äôs probably needs no introduction here, Easyway and it‚Äôs many revisions and expansions are well known to have helped millions to quit. The concepts within them are sound, helping people to understand the nature of the addition and removing the brainwashing. It require no willpower but may not work for everyone. The biggest challenge when reading it is removing the mental barrier to read it through in the first place and relax enough to really absorb the information.

I had been using 3mg nicotine free base juice, but that was just getting me by between cigarettes. It had been a year since I last bought a pack, but all of my friends smoke so id have one or two or three when I'd hang out with them. I got a new vape and switched to 18mg salt nic juice. While I'm not thrilled about increasing my nicotine intake by 6 times, it basically stopped the cigarette cravings in their tracks (I have absolutely no intentions on ever going higher with the nicotine). It's been about 4 months since my last smoke and  if someone offered me a cigarette right now, I honestly wouldn't want one. That said, I've hit my vape twice since typing this. I am using this thing constantly. If I go out to run errands or anything that's not hanging out with friends, I usually leave the vape at home. If I'm occupying myself, it takes about 4 hours for the lack of vaping to really start bothering me, but I can see that being manageable with patches. 

The patches are my next step and my goal is to be completely nicotine free. I'm tempted to put the vape down for the last time now, but am hesitant because I think I might be moving too fast. I have a tendency to bite off more than I can chew, toughing through it for a while, then collapsing. That has been my pattern with a lot of things in life and smoking is no exception. I've gone almost a year without nicotine before, then tragedy happened and I bummed a smoke from a neighbor that was out smoking while I was trying to get ahold of my senses. I told him what had happened (he asked about why there were a bunch of cop cars outside our place) and he gave me the rest of his pack. It was one of those situations where they don't accept no as an answer and I was vulnerable enough to take them (he bought them by the carton). My point is that maybe I should go longer than 4 months since my last cigarette before trying to quit nicotine completely. It's easy to say no to smoking when your body is overflowing with nicotine. Maybe I should give it more time to push the thought of smoking farther from my mind (which is happening the longer I choose vaping over smoking).

Here's where it is the hardest. I could be classified as an alcoholic and get drunk with my friends once or twice a week. It's to the point where I have a hard time hanging out with them and not drinking (that's a problem for another day). They also chain smoke. So twice a week it's a group of guys drinking heavily, chain smoking, and playing chess. Basically the perfect environment to make someone like me want to smoke. The vape is the only reason I'm able to be there and not smoke and even still, I struggle. If I quit vaping today and fall back into smoking, that will be the reason why. I'd love nothing more than to never hit a vape again, but if 5 years from now I'm nicotine free, it's not going to matter if it took me a year of no cigarettes before getting off the vape. Rushing this and falling back into smoking will however be a problem.

Has anyone used vaping to quit smoking? Would you recommend I give it more time off of the cigarettes before using patches to get off the vape? While this question is worded for people that use or have used vapes, anyone can weigh in and give their two cents. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, regardless of whether or not you've used a vape.",3,0

Marijuana stayed with me the longest.  I first smoked marijuana in 1991 when I was 17 & I continued to smoke marijuana through my 20's.

From 1994 through 1999 I tried many different drugs.  Cocaine when I was 21 & again at 29.  I certainly abused Ephedrine, a legal speed, frequently in the 90's when I was in my college years.

Certainly I ate mushrooms a few times, dabbled in acid a few times & drank frequently.

But nothing-including cocaine-was every addictive.  I easily quit all drugs after college.

The only drug that has ever had an addictive quality is nicotine.

I've never even been tempted to use cocaine again.  I use to like to smoke marijuana but the allure fades with age & I did not like being stoned & low energy.

I've quit many times.  Sometimes for a few years at a time.  I always start again.  I've got questions.

&#x200B;

1. As a young man, I smoked marijuana & experimented with cocaine a few times.  No drug came close to being addictive to me.  When it was time to quit marijuana, I barely thought about it.  I also did not miss alcohol, though I enjoyed drinking in college. I even smoked speed once.  But absolutely nothing has been addictive but cigarettes.  I had no problem quitting marijuana, was never tempted to use speed or coke again...The tobacco addiction is much stronger than any other drug I ever tried when I was young.  I never thought about cocaine again, for example.  Yet I love cigarettes.  I first tried cigarettes at age 13.  I was soon addicted.  Certainly by 14.  Why did I become so horribly addicted to tobacco in particular?
2. I feel utterly empty & bleak without tobacco or cigarettes & the length of time I have quit has not no bearing on this whatsoever.  Without cigarettes, a gloom & meaninglessness befalls me. 
3. I'm unfocused & spaced out without cigarettes & this time I am quitting again & the feelings of spaced-out dazedness is much stronger than the last time I quit smoking 10 years ago.
4. The cravings for cigarettes don't diminish much after 2 weeks.  
5. I have terrible sweats.  
6. I have horrible panic attacks without a cigarettes.  My heart pounds.

i have tried nicotine patches very recently and it seems i've had some kind of reaction to the patch. two things have happened. 

first, which i'm not too worried about, is a red patch of skin where the patch was. now i'm not too concerned about that and i halfway expected something like that to happen but it was still alarming nonetheless. underneath where the patch was, the skin became raised, red, and very itchy. i say i'm not too concerned about that because, after a while, the itching and redness went away.

what i'm really worried about is on my skin, where i had the patches, my skin is now a few shades darker and in a square shape exactly like the patch. i have scrubbed and washed the areas but they have not gone away or appear to have gotten lighter. in addition to darker skin, it has become rough and i can feel tiny bumps in some areas. i'm worried i'm now going to have these permanent dark squares where the patches were. searching google i haven't found one thing about this and that seems kind of odd. has anyone else heard of/experienced this or know what to do about it?",3,0

I kept seeing people quit for a few days around me and then go back to smoking. And I was always perplexed by this because I thought, ""if you can not smoke for one day, why not just carry on?"". It mostly came from the thought that it would be impossible for me to spend even one day without cigarettes.

However, after I had a breakdown a month ago (I did want to quit for at least a year) over the miserable state of my throat (acid reflux irritation, irritation from smoking, have a deviated septum so I sleep with my mouth open so more irritation), I finally managed to quit smoking. 

It wasn't easy for the first week at all. I could barely concentrate on anything else than the thought of smoking. However, I kept telling myself no, no, no. And remembering my throat, or how my dad died of lung cancer (not saying that it isn't possible for me to still die of it, just lowered my chances a little), and so on. 

And I want to say that I have of the poorest motivation a person can have. I'm not usually motivated or ambitious or stuff like that. So I wholeheartedly believe that most people can do it. With help, without help, whatever they need as long as they reach that endgame of not smoking. 

For folks with mental illness, I also have anxiety, depression, an array of other symptoms that are not typical. If you have a psychologist or a therapist, etc. talk to them about how can they help you quit. If you don't have one and feel like you would benefit from their help, reach out to one. If you decide to do it alone: it is harder for us than for most folk because sometimes certain mental illnesses can make us more prone to addiction in general. BUT you can do it! I believe in you!

Anyway, just wanted to say that obviously my journey isn't over and I do still think of cigarettes sometimes, but I don't really crave them anymore. I did try to expose myself to triggers (my mom is a smoker, I have smoker friends, I drink coffee), and the only one I have trouble with is beer but I am not that big on alcohol anyway so it doesn't matter. I wanted to do this because I didn't want to have to leave the situation just because I'm no longer a smoker. However, if you feel like you need to do this to get over that first period of time when you transition, do it. You know your own abilities. 

And I also wanted to wish everyone here struggling with quitting so much luck. I know how bad it is, I know it's very hard to change your life like that, but you are bigger than this challenge. You can do it. It is hard work, but you can do it.",41,0

Zyn, is pretty much just crystalized nicotine in a pouch and I thought this would be a healthier alternative to chew. In some ways it was better (breath, no spitting, more discrete) but it was VERY addictive. Because it was so easy, I started having a pouch in my mouth all the time. Work, home, weekends, pretty much anytime I was awake. Then I would start using 2 pouches or was swapping them out faster. My nicotine use skyrocketed and I was consuming about 10 pouches/day or 60 mg/day. I wasn't even enjoying the nicotine either, I just needed it to feel normal. Anyway, Here were some things that motivated me to quit

1.	My wife didn't know and I was sneaking it. I felt horrible that I was doing this behind her back. I would be consistently doing shady shit behind her back to make sure I got my Zyn. Like, finding reasons to ""go to the store to pick something up"" or ""go for a walk by myself""

2.	If I ran out and couldn‚Äôt get any I would turn into a monster. I mean, I‚Äôm a pretty levelheaded, patient husband and father but if I knew I wasn't going to get any Zyn that day I could guarantee I would get into a nasty fight with my wife... It was crazy, I couldn't even help myself. everything she said/did was so annoying when I was missing Zyn.

3.	Nicotine was killing me. We addicts forget that Nicotine is toxic to the body. My pee smelled bad from my body expelling that shit. Us Vapers and Zyn users tell ourselves that its not so bad because it doesn't have any tobacco in it but the nicotine is the worst part. The nicotine made me lethargic. I didn't have the energy for walks and just wanted to sit in one place and have a pouch in my mouth. I stopped eating as much because that would mean taking out my pouches - lost more weight then I needed.


I had tried to quite before but it didn‚Äôt last. What I noticed was that my addiction would tell me that I would never be the same without nicotine. For me, it would tell me that I could never focus and concentrate without it. I think the ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù is different for each addict but I believe the addiction focuses on one area of your life that ‚Äúwould just not be the same without nicotine‚Äù So this time, while quitting, I was hyper focused on how I was feeling better without nicotine. I noticed the following and would remind myself all the time.

1.	I have more energy and want to be more active.
2.	My posture has improved ‚Äì no idea why, but nicotine was making it hard for me to hold my body upright.
3.	My skin has improved and looks better.
4.	My mood is more level
5.	I spend less time thinking and worrying about when/how I will get Zyn. This is a major relief.
6.	I can focus not more than ever and will get even better at this as I continue to stay off nicotine. (hard to focus at first)
7.	I don‚Äôt have to lie to my family.
8.	I‚Äôm saving money.
9.	I‚Äôm more observant to my surroundings. I feel more in the moment and less trapped inside my addicted brain.


Anyway, getting off nicotine has dramatically changed my life. I don‚Äôt think we realize how nicotine is negatively impacting EVERY aspect of who you are and what you do. By using nicotine you are micro dosing poison ‚Äì the only difference is that the poison is good at telling us it is actually good for us. I know it sounds dramatic but I have regrets that nicotine has taken something from me for the last 10 years that I will never get back. You should quite and you should today. Stay obsessively focused on the benefits and don‚Äôt believe nicotine‚Äôs lie that you need any part of it to be normal. Don‚Äôt focus on the bad feelings of quitting ‚Äì they are temporary but you will start to feel benefits right away. Look for the benefits not the negatives.",14,0

My problem wasnt cigarettes but ""chops"", a mix of marijuana and tobacco. Honestly so disgusting I hate people watching me smoke.

I had been working to improve my willpower and this week I just blew it one day. I said I was going to wait until the afternoon, and I caved at like 10 am. I was so disappointed in myself. I decided to simply put my bong in a trash bag and drop it off the balcony onto the concrete. I involved my gf in my goals, only had half a glass of wine with dinner because I didnt want to trigger cravings. Unfortunately my possibly soon to be ex, decided to cause a fight over me slicing a massive piece of pizza in half as if i told her she was fat. Got through the whole thing with only some yelling. Told her how it doesn't feel at all like she's giving me any support. Usually stuff like this triggers me to smoke way later than I want because It just gets my mind going too much. She claims ""she forgot"" I hadnt been smoking. Like how? my moodiness has been the center of the last 2 days. Thats the only thing im extremely upset about Its almost like she wants me to keep smoking like her parents. No decisions until my mind gets more balanced. Still going strong, the willpower to finally break through to not feeling like everything sucks. Got the Ac going and manging my chills and sweats a little better.

No cravings or withdrawls,"So this sounds pretty insane. I've been trying to quit for a while. Even broke a bunch of cigarettes and dumped water on them only to go to the store an hour later and buy another pack. 10 years ago I quit cold turkey by smoking an entire pack as quickly as possible. I got myself so sick that for 7-8 years the thought of smoking made me want to puke. 

I picked up smoking again 2-3 years ago and as stress accumulated I smoked more and more until I got myself at a pack a day. Tried to quit for the last couple months. Even bought myself the gum and some other nicotine replacements. It wasn't until I watched a 5 minute youtube video with Allen Carr where it just clicked and I reframed the way I saw it. I watched this video at a lucky spot where I was inbetween packs so it wasn't like I had several cigarettes left to finish. (That's how they get you)

It's been 5 days and I have thought about smoking twice. Both when I was really stressed about something, but I figured why would I make the situation worse? Having a few days under my belt makes it easier physically and psychologically. 5 days is a good number and it'll only grow more from here. 

This is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc&ab_channel=Ollys)

specifically 1:46 - 2:46  

I didn't want to quit because of the obvious nootropic effects of nicotine. It's undeniable that it has an effect on your thinking and gives you a boost. However in the larger scheme of things it is doing real damage to your circulation, the levels of oxygen you get and is in fact horrible for your brain.  

I also didn't want to quit because cigarettes have a tranquilizing effect on me. But what good is a few moments of numbness if I'm always worried? It's like giving yourself a mosquito bite so you can have the pleasure of scratching it. Only after a while scratching it starts to hurt and you're basically trapped in a damned if you do damned if you don't situation.

I also didn't want to quit because I love having small breaks where I go outside and take a few minutes alone with my thoughts and my cigarette. Man, even typing this out now I have no cravings and I don't miss those moments. It's pretty insane how effective that video was.

I thought I'd check with you all if the way I'm handling my husband's smoking is beneficial for him in the long run. 

He began smoking when he was 16. Used to be a pack a day smoker until he was about 20. He is 23 now. A bit of a social smoker at parties and rarely buys his own packs.  

I've noticed that he starts smoking mostly when he is stressed out due to overworking or a life event. During busy periods at work he will smoke for about a week or two straight of (I'm guessing) 4 ciggs a day, then have up to 4-5 month breaks. He has told me that it's not something he wants to do and overall he preffers not to. 

I used to be annoying and get visibly upset and ask him to chuck out the cigarettes or give it to his friends whenever I smelt it on him. He would usually follow through. I know making someone feel guilty never truly helps though. 

I don't say anything anymore. I just pretend I don't care and don't see or smell. I know it's best when someone quits due to personal wishes and in their own time- but I'm afraid that I'm not taking the chance to help him nip a bad habit in the bud before he gets physical withdrawal symptoms again. I really care for him and his health but I don't want to be annoying or make him feel guilty. Also not sure if it's even worth mentioning since he already knows the harm and in the end it's his decision.

Is it better to not say anything? 

Tldr; How do you wish to be supported by your partner in quitting? Do you preffer if they just leave you alone or if they gently nag you when they spot you smoking?",4,0

Started in college, 2nd year, first semester. Im trying to remember the frequency at which I used to smoke but I can‚Äôt. I do remember one non-smoking senior asking if it really felt like flying in the clouds.
Kept it going through college and into work. I can‚Äôt recall how many per day I used to smoke, but it can‚Äôt have been a nice polite number like 4/5 per day.
After a couple of years I moved back in with my parents, during which time I kept it under control, in the sense that I started to count and control how many I‚Äôm smoking per day. At this point I‚Äôm still not thinking I should quit, I‚Äôm only self-conscious because I‚Äôm living with my parents. 
So far, I wasn‚Äôt worried. I mean I was smoking but I could still go a day or two without one and I was still young, look at Keith Richards or that other guy who smokes. 
Time goes on. I turned 30. I moved to a new country and the last 3 years have been horrible. My natural anxiety, plus no checks like the presence of parents, plus the fact that I can‚Äôt buy individual cigarettes here, have turned me into a chain smoker. Initially I did not care. New country, new people, everyday something new.  But novelty wears off, it took me 1 year(34, if you count from the beginning) to realize it‚Äôs the same shit everywhere.
The past 6 months have been extra horrible. You can probably see what‚Äôs coming. 
Yes, depression, a general lack of motivation, the constant negative feedback loop of telling myself this will be the last pack or that I will control the frequency but then succumbing, are taking their toll. I‚Äôm in danger. I‚Äôm becoming a recluse. A Gollum.

At this point I‚Äôm quite sure smoking is the symptom of a deeper problem, but I honestly don‚Äôt care. My future might very well be shitty, but it won‚Äôt be because of cigarettes. I‚Äôll keep trying, I made it past 24 hrs in a very long time plus this time I posted here which I tell myself to do every single time I ‚Äòquit‚Äô but never do. Ever time I see a post here I feel glad for the person because they made an effort. 
So, please wish me luck. 
Thank you.",76,0

I realized today that I get really depressed (nothing makes fun, I'm excited about nothing, it's a feeling I always get if I either don't drink coffee or change my diet radically like last time when I tried keto) when I'm not exposed to the smoke for a longer time. This feeling really sucks, but once I'm with my dad and the cigarette's smoke is directed towards me, so I can inhale it, I feel immediately better and more motivated to life

Sometimes if I inhale it my whole body is tingling and I can't help but smile

Is such an ""addiction"" even possible just because of second hand smoke? I thought about asking it somewhere else, but I guess you will know it better. 

Remember that the smoke is basically running towards me when I'm with dad (due to wind for example), so if I inhale it it's like I'd light a cigarette and hold it in front of my nose (so it's not like a ""I'm in a big room with a little bit of smoke here and there"" scenario)",3,0

Tried staying off them but eventually went back to smoking full time.

Now on the 6th of June I decided I was done and went cold turkey again. First week was absolute hell, a lot worse than I remember compared to that first week in January. But tomorrow will be day 60 without smokes! Woohoo! The cravings really reduced after the first 2-3 weeks and I felt fine. While they came on occasion, they were managable, and I felt I knew how to deal with them.

However, in the past week or 2 they have come back with a vengeance and I'm not sure what the trigger is. Its not like i'm doing anything differently and I know by now that they will only last for a short while and then i'll be good again.

But they just seem way more intense and frequent all of a sudden. So bad that sometimes I start thinking that familiar thought:'Shall I just get a pack, smoke 1 and throw the rest away?' which has happened in prior quit attempts. Obviously, this has not happened and I don't plan on letting it happen. But I'm worried about it.

It seemed to be getting better and now its getting worse. I know you can keep having cravings the rest of your life but that they should be less frequent, right now the opposite is happening and its really bugging me.

You can use chantex or some other drug.  You can try slowly quitting, or vapeing, or even cold turkey.  You can try gum patches longes, any number of substitutes.  They will all fail unless you do one thing.

YOU MUST COMMITT WITH EVERY FIBER IN YOUR BEING.  

You have to want it more than life itself.  You have to.  Because when you first stop its going to feel like you are going to die if you don't have one.  

Whatever your motivation, it needs to be so powerful that you are willing to give up your own life for it.  If you are not that committed, chances are you will fail.

Because at the end of the day, all those things are aides to help you, but it's you that has to do it.

There will be a time when no one is around, no one is watching and an opportunity to smoke will appear.  And in that moment, you have to decide, what is stronger, your resolve to quit, or your addiction.

If you fail then get back up and try again.  Your walk to having a smoke free life may involve stumbling.  But stumbles are ok as long as you keep getting back up.  It's only when you stop that you have failed.  You stumble and fall its no big deal.  Who cares, you can always wash your clothes when you get their.  But if you stop because you look at those stains from your stumbles, then you'll never get to be clean.

It isnt that you maybe have fallen.  The measure of success is how you get back up.

Exercise, stable eating routines, better coping skills with stress all helps, but I want to emphasize that I feel like it was an additional step for me to remember how it was like to be a smoker in the process of getting rid of this addiction. I am not sure whether I am rationalizing smoking again after 5 months but I feel like remembering the feelings of lack of motivation, escapist attitude, and depressed mood and all that made me a stronger in my attitude against being a smoker. It was way better when I was not smoking. So believe me it is better not to smoke and deal with things in more constructive ways.

I didn't really plan on quitting - I was thinking about it for a while (several years probably) but it was a very spur of the moment thing.

I didn't read Allen Carr - I tried a few years ago but it felt really preachy and full of things I was already aware of and reading them didn't really put me off smoking.

I didn't quit nicotine cold turkey - I did use nicotine gum for 3 or 4 weeks (don't really remember exactly) and it was of great help. Don't let anyone tell you ""cold turkey"" is the only way, chewing nicotine gum for a few weeks/months or even years is much better option than inhaling tar.

I did overeat and gain about 15% of my body weight in about 2 months - oops. Snacking was a godsend to stop smoking imo, enjoying food is one of the few more powerful things than smoking I had to rely on. The weight gain was annoying but about 3 months in I've joined a gym and started walking more and the weight and then some is off at this point.

&#x200B;

My tips:

I was a pack, pack-and-a-half smoker. The physical addiction was not that bad tbh, I didn't really have any withdrawal symptoms - perhaps a bit of very light ""brain fog"" for a month or so - but that's also due to the combo of overeating etc perhaps. The habitual triggers are the most annoying ones, but about 3-4 weeks in most of them were really really weak and it was 0 problems after that, and I had the nicotine gum to rely on till then which I used at about 4(week 1)-3(week 2)-2(week 3)-1(week4) per day rate.

Some habits from before smoking are simply not enjoyable and that's ok. Like, sitting down at a coffee shop/bar with my friends for hours is a no go at this point. I get bored in exactly 3.5 minutes and start getting fidgety. Having an all day hike or ride around on my bike all day? Hell yes. Be prepared your life will probably look different once you stop smoking and some of your old activities will become mind numbingly boring.",3,0

It's fucked because obviously it's the addiction at work and all the nasty chemicals causing me to think this way. 

I feel if before I'm able to quit, I have to keep it real with myself and acknowledge this aspect of the journey,  because it really does feel uniquely  great to give into the cravings every time. 

Anyone here use the David Goggins mentally to quit and just say to themselves that they will go through the suffering because they dont want to be weak and a little pussy ass bitch who gives into that voice that tries to destroy them?

If anyone hasn't read the concepts that the book talks about, you should definitely give it a read or listen. One of things he talks about is brainwashing, and I know that's my issue. It's what kept me thinking about cigarettes almost all the time during a 4 year quit, leading to a couple of minor relapses. The key for me will be figuring out how to unbrainwash myself. 

The thing that is really difficult for me is that I've always had a fascination with smoking even before I ever tried it. I'm sure this is because I was around people who smoked all the time. Perhaps i even became addicted to it having been around it all the time? The events that led me to smoking the first time was just...I couldn't ever get it out of my head. I enjoyed being around it even at a young age. I didn't succumb to peer pressure as a teen or anything.

I was always, from the moment I started to the moment I stopped, a closet smoker.

As a closet smoker, I just learned to live with withdrawal. At a half a pack or day or less, I never became a pack a day smoker, and never became someone who just smoked without realizing it. I was always satisfying a fairly hefty craving because I just hid it from almost everyone I knew. Could this play some role in why I've always had difficulty stopping? Alan Carr talks about the first cigarettes after a relapse, or the first cigarettes you smoke as you become addicted, or the first cigarette you have after a long withdrawal. Those are the ones that ""make you feel better"" before your body builds up a tolerance to the nicotine. But...that was ALWAYS my experience smoking. Since I'd only ever smoke every 2 to 4 hours, it always felt good to relieve the withdrawal. For me, often times it was something I ""get to do"", in addition to something I ""have to do.""

So, when Alan talks about ""I bet you smoke half of your cigarettes without ever even realizing you're doing it,"" this just isn't something I can relate to at all. I was always hyper, hyper aware of when I was smoking because of my nature as a closet smoker.

He also talks a lot about how smoking makes you feel more relaxed because you're relieving withdrawal from your last cigarette...but I've also found this to be contrary, because even my first cigarette felt like I was able to find some comfort and relief. Is this because of the way I grew up, always having been around smokers? How on Earth do I undo THAT kind of brainwashing?

I've just had intrusive thoughts about smoking...maybe since I was 6 years old. I'd love to talk to a therapist about it, but financially this isn't an option for me at the moment. Just had to rant this in case anyone else has had similar experiences. 

I've stopped, but I still don't find myself wanting to. I feel like I want to want to want to stop, if that makes any sense. Like I was smoking, and then someone ripped the rug out from me, and I have to figure out my reasons afterward. 

I have not smoked since June 20th.",3,0
758,2021-08-01 12:59:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ovvtxu/i_want_to_quit_so_badly/,I want to quit so badly,"but I don't know how? Okay, well, of course I ""know how"". but I like... don't know how to live my life without smoking. I started smoking when I was 15, I'm 23 now. I feel like smoking is so deeply ingrained in who I am, I feel I'll be missing a massive part of myself without it. I lost my dad to brain cancer back in February, my fianc√© is chronically ill and really not doing well, we're preparing to move out of state to be closer to his family. I've hardly been able to work this year because of how chaotic and awful things have been. This is the first time I'll really be on my own. Cigarettes are substantially more expensive in New York than they are in PA, I have no idea how I'll even be able to afford to spend $10+ on a pack of cigarettes everyday while also paying for rent, food, gas and everything. I'm so sick of clearing my throat all the time, I'm sick of that ""I'm just not breathing as well as I should be"" feeling. It scares the shit out of me, I'm terrified of the complications and I'm terrified of cancer but none of that has ever been enough to make me stop. Ironically, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a surgeon. I want to live a long and healthy life. I'm healthier now otherwise than I've ever been. I'm physically healthy, I eat well, I move lots and I feel great BESIDES the smoking. When I manage to smoke a bit less I definitely feel a bit better but it's so hard to not fall back on ""having just one more"" when I'm sitting by myself thinking about how daunting everything always is. I know that people smoke for decades and still quit but for some reason I feel like I've already fucked myself over by smoking for 7 years. I'm discouraged by the idea of quitting just to find out that maybe I already have cancer or something. I don't think I do, but what if I do? What if I never feel better? Is it even worth it? I know it is. I've tried alternatives like vaping, but it's no less expensive and it really doesn't make my lungs feel any better. I don't want to trade off this addiction for another equally expensive, potentially just as damaging one.

Any time I've ever expressed frustration about not knowing how to quit there's always someone telling me to ""eat candy instead"". I have a history of disordered eating and an addictive personality, so the thought of ""eating instead"" makes me paranoid that I'll gain a ton of weight and that's always put me off as well. It's all so stupid because I know that I can do it. It's so hard to conceptualize my life without smoking because I've been doing it throughout my entire teenage/young adult life. I'm afraid I might adapt some other awful habit in its place. Things have been so rough for the last two years and cigarettes have always been there for me when I need a moment of silence to myself. Sorry for making such a long post, there's so much on my mind. I really needed to talk about this someplace. I just don't know what I'd do otherwise. What do I do when I'm stressed out at work and I get my break? I won't have a cigarette to look forward to. What do I do if something awful happens to my fianc√©? I can't change the circumstances that are putting his life in danger but I can smoke to ""feel better"". It's so twisted, I know it doesn't make me ""feel better"" at all. I feel like this is the worst time I could try to quit because stress is constantly so high lately, I feel like it'll be impossible but I want to stop so, so, so bad. Thank you, to anyone who bothered to read all of this. I know it's a mess. This all feels like such a mess.",17,0
