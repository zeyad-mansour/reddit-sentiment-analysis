Would one get withdrawals even after just half a pack? It's very possible that I just got a cold, but this has also happened previously, and so am just wondering if this is normal. I must say that these short-term withdrawals (if real) are real motivators to not slip up again.

I started smoking just after my 16th birthday. I'm 31 now.
First time I tried stopping in my teens, made it two days when I started getting a painful sensation in my chest. Had two smokes and the pain went away. This is when I realised I was addicted. As the years went by I tried a few more times with the same results.

Fast forward a few years.. I lost my father, who was a heavy smoker, to emphysema. That wasn't enough to make me stop.
Heard about Allen Carr's Easy Way. Got the book and read it... Wow it was so easy to stop. No cravings, no withdrawal. That was it, I'd never smoke again... 

... I was smoke free for 3 years...

Broke the rules and had a smoke everytime I went drinking. Which eventually turned into going drinking just for an excuse to smoke. Which turned into full on smoking.
Read the book again two years later, stopped for another year... Then fell into the same drinking trap.

I've since read the book again as well as 'The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently' twice. No luck at all.
I've made countless attempts this year to quit, but every time I try, I end up smoking more than ever. It's becoming really expensive. 
What's worse is that my wife is smoking now too, because of me. I feel if I quit, it would help her to stop too... 

I found this sub and everyone seems very supportive. I'm going out for a party tomorrow night, so I know I'm going to chain smoke. But I'm planning on stopping on Saturday. I've had enough. I don't enjoy smoking. I need to stop. 
I'll keep coming back here for the motivation. 

If you managed to read through all this, thank you. Never expected it to go on so long. 

TLDR Can't stop. Will stop.",8,0

I started smoking when I was 16 and have had several times where I've quit for years at a time. In my mid 20s I started vaping and did that for several years up until 6 months ago when I decided to completely cut it all out of my life. I've been so proud of myself ever since.

That was until tonight when my mom told me, my two siblings, my brother-in-law, and sister-in-law that she had good news!

She was no longer cancer free.  That medically in the past month things were really good and she's completely in the clear for now.

Her bad news, however, was that she had the diagnosis to begin with and had surgery for it.

This came at a complete shock to my family who were all hearing this for the first time together.

I want to preface this now by saying my mom has been through so much. I lost my father to pancreatic cancer when I was 12. She has been a role model parent to me and my siblings, even taking care of my grandma who had dementia while she was a single mother.

Needless to say it completely broke my heart to hear she was just telling us all this news now. It pains me knowing we couldn't be there for her while she was sick. She didn't want to worry us and I just couldn't handle it. She's a long time smoker and after the conversation shifted I left the room with my brother-in-law and we snuck and split 2 cigarettes. I feel so terrible about it now which is why I'm here at 4AM, technically Thanksgiving day, pouring my heart out on Reddit. I am devastated and ashamed of myself. This is not a healthy coping mechanism  and I know better. I just need an outlet right now. 

For anyone in a stressful situation, don't smoke. It will only leave you feeling worse. Love to you all. Stay strong. Happy Thanksgiving.

Survey takes 5 - 10 minutes - No Written answers are required so it can be as quick as you want to make it 

*What are my answers helping you with?*

I am in my final undergraduate year at University in the UK and my final major project centres around the research, design and development of a final product. Essentially your answers are helping me identify real user needs and pain points. From these I am creating concepts and eventually final working prototypes and model designs. All of this is for my degree but also, I hope my prototypes and research can influence and inspire better tobacco quitting aids in the future.

Be prepared for possible triggers. Drinking alcohol, travel problems,  family stress,  memories of good times with people you haven‚Äôt seen since you quit. What will you do if you are tempted?

If you make a commitment to post here *before* you take another puff, there‚Äôs a good chance that someone will say something that will help you get through the challenge. Just writing it down can help you step back,  analyze the situation, and imagine how bad you will feel if you relapse. If you think about how you would reply to your post if it were someone else, you may well talk yourself out of throwing away your quit.

When you post after you lapse, people can only give you sympathy and encouragement. They will say things which may make you feel better in the moment but probably won‚Äôt help you stay quit. It is really difficult to keep a quit going after you use again. That‚Äôs just the reality of drug addiction.

So, if you are serious about quitting, make the commitment  to post before you lapse. Delay is your friend.",28,0

It's like each time I get that thought, it almost feels as if I've just had a puff after a fucking long time, and there's a mental hit, just to realize, no there isn't, that's in your head, and you want a smoke.

And I know a smoke will not quench the thirst, like I have had a smoke after abstaining for really long, and thought it would be glorious, but it isn't. The screeching inside just goes down a couple of notches, but the second and third puffs, the rest of the cigarette just gives you a feeling of broken promises. It quite literally just tastes like betrayal. 

But, The worst part of what I'm trying to figure out is I don't know how a life without smoking's gonna be. I've smoked for only 6 years, is a lot less to someone else, but has been most of my adult life, and in the last few years when I didn't have to hide it, it's become a part and parcel of my normal functioning.
After I've had a good meal, after I've had a heavy meal, when I'm bored, when I need to feel important (<- Wow, I never realized, I smoked to feel important. Fuck.), when I need  to feel I'm in control, when I've to call and speak to mum and dad, when I wake up, when I need to sleep, when I'm not getting sleep, when I've smoked up (oh, I especially love this), when I'm drinking, when I'm drunk, after I've successfully finished something, when I'm struggling with something.

I don't really know what am I gonna do at all of those times. To think of the time I'd be saving not lighting up during all of these tasks. Wow what am I gonna do with all of this time.

But anywhoo, if you've read until here, and you've struggled beyond, or are struggling at this moment, what do you do?
What activity do you put in that void of smoking, or how do you replace the thought of I think I need a smoke.

Am I making any sense? I probably am not, but I am struggling and holding on with the skin of my teeth to not go get one and light up.
I just wanna know there'll be a day when I'm not feeling so miserable. And yes, I don't plan to or mean to be moping around but God help me",3,0

I'm 42 and started when I was 16. Being a counselor/psychologist I am taking a different approach to quitting this time and diving in to the emotional connection I have to smoking. I studied a book by Gabor Mate, a leading psychologist on addiction, called ""In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts."" He outlines a five step program for fighting an addiction. I made myself this short list of the steps in a way that makes sense for me. I refer to it many times everyday and it is helping with the process.  Thought I'd share it in hopes that it might help some of you. Blessings to all of you on this difficult journey. It's so helpful having this forum and I appreciate everyone sharing and supporting one another. 

Step 1- Relabel - I do not need to smoke. There is no real need that smoking will satisfy

Step 2- Reattribute- what is my emotional need right now and how can I nurture it? 

Step 3- Refocus- find something else to do. It's not how you feel that counts, it's what you do. 

Step 4- Revalue- devalue what smoking has done for me (without judgment). 

Step 5- Recreate- come home to my true self. When I honor my creativity I will transcend the feeling of deficient emptiness that drives addiction.",6,0

Ultimately it's too stressful wondering where my next pod is going to come from since they are banned in MA and life is too busy with two kids to go to NH to get them. 

And it's good to quit. 

With lozenges, do I need to swallow the spit that is produced, or is the nicotine absorbed through the gums like chewing tobacco?  I am mildly allergic to the sweetener (sucralose) in the gums and lozenges, and can't find any without it. (I have not found an artificial sweetener that doesn't have me vomiting within the hour).

I can handle it if I'm not swallowing the sweetener would be my guess. Patches aren't really an option for me because I may or may not have been a closet juuler and don't want any questions as to why I have a patch on my thigh/arm/whatever.

To stop smoking without help of an alternative methods of taking in  nicotine was impossible for me because I need to drive a lot for work and I could not concentrate on driving when I was craving nicotine. I tried nicotine gum and vaping a couple of times which didn't really work because both of these methods rely on a specific moment of taking in the nicotine, which remind me too much of smoking. 

On Monday I decided I wanted to try nicotine patches. This method seems great for me. These things make me forget that I just stopped smoking and the very light (i guess psychological) craving to cigarettes is very stable and manageable for me right now. 

On the first day it was like I was released from a curse. No more looking at the clock to see how much longer until my next smoke. No more planning my commute to/from work tank-station to tank-station, or being in the playground with my kids craving cigarettes knowing I would give off the wrong example to my kids if I light one up.

I really feel freed from a curse. And today I read on this sub that stopping at the age of 35 restores the life expectancy to a non smoker which is pretty encouraging for a 39 yo.

- someone once told me something so simple yet so effective, I believe it is the single most effective method of staying a non-smoker: ‚Äúas soon as you think of smoking, think of something else..‚Äù
This seems basic but it makes a lot of sense and has helped me considerably. I am being more mindful of my thought processes and can channel my energy to more positive things. 
- when I‚Äôm having cravings, I also take the time to take multiple deep breaths and savour the crisp air and focus on my unabatucted lungs and how good it feels. 
- slowly sipping water has also helped. 

I was a year and a half into this process, with not a single puff. It wasn‚Äôt until I got drunk with a good friend who insisted (multiple times) that I have a cigarette with him. I caved in, and eight months later I was still smoking. 
There is no such thing as ‚Äújust one‚Äù. It‚Äôll feed the monster and before you know it, you‚Äôre a filthy smoker again. 
I am now one month smoke free and my mantra is simply ‚ÄúI have no desire to smoke. Ever‚Äù. Not one puff. Ever..",18,0

My husband smokes. My friends smoke. The mums at the school bus stop smoke. I sit in smokers cars while they smoke. I drink with smokers who give fags out like sweeties so they don't have to be out alone in the cold and wet. 

I don't want to do this anymore.

118,2019-11-25 04:17:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/e1dkbh/what_i_learned_from_smoking/,What I learned from smoking,"Im new to this subreddit. Just now joined, first post, havent even read any of the material on here (sorry mods, plz forgive).

Im not a long-time smoker. I used to smoke weed while living in the Netherlands, but with very little tobacco. Used to occasionally ask for a cigarette if drinking, usually in a club/bar's smoking area. Then around other 'proper smokers' I'd occasionally partake. Then I'd occasionally get my own if I knew I was going out to club/bars. Then I discovered coffee and cigarettes, beer and cigarettes, and now I just smoke daily, usually on my balcony at home or at cafe/bars. All those 'occasions' lead to what I guess I have to now confront as an addiction (first time to admit that too, phew, :[ ...)

Anyway.
What I learned:

1/ Smoking tobacco relaxes my muscles.
That means I have tension and probably that means im stressed. My body probably recognises tobacco as a stress relief and tells me to go do that. Next time I think of smoking I'll try doing some stretches or relaxing some other way. Maybe I can re-train that behavior.

2/ I used to think I was a crazy lightweight with weed. Turns out its just some kind of nicotine rush because I get the same feeling on my first cigarette of the day.

3/ After the nicotine rush wears off, I take a big breath of air and get a second 'high' which is probably lungs thanking me for oxygen. So, next time I feel like smoking I'll go to my balcony and take some great big breaths and see if I can get that second rush without the first. After a cigarette I always think 'I should try that' but always forget, so I'm hoping that writing this post will help enforce the memory.

4/ Despite the relaxing aspect, my muscles seem to get - overall - less flexible the more I smoke. I quite like being flexible so acknowledging this point sometimes helps deter me. Its like a trade-off. But again, I forget about it until the next time I do stretches. 

Thats it from me. All the best to you humans. Dont smoke, okay?

They are a stimulant that work on the same neurological pathways as cocaine and many other mind altering substances. This is not my opinion, this is a fact. If you quit and you get panic attacks, angry, tearful, stressed out, it‚Äôs because you have quit a DRUG.

It can takes months and months for your brain to regain it chemical balance. These feelings can come in waves at a time. You can feel sick, then amazing, then crappy, then depressed. 

Your body is healing.

There are people on here that will advise you take meds because they were not strong enough to wait it out. That is not their fault, for some people it can be brutal. For you it can be brutal too. But just remind yourself that you don‚Äôt just go ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô overnight or in the space of a few days for no reason.

Your brain doesn‚Äôt just stop working for no reason!!!

You will get your life back. I promise you. 

Practice self care, inform your family and friends that you will not be you for quite a while.

You will be you again. You will feel normal again. 

There‚Äôs a reason people on here post daily, weekly, monthly and eventually even forget their quit dates.

BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR LIVES BACK!

PAWS is a term in the drug world that describes waves of symptoms that can happen for the first 24 months after quitting a drug. Anxiety, anger, depression, sickness, insomnia.

Wrong!

This is the bullshit I was told and many others get told

YOU QUIT A DRUG!

Earlier this year I read the first half of Allen Carr‚Äôs book. It just got too repetitive for me and I couldn‚Äôt finish it, but I got EXTREMELY good info from it and it changed my whole way of thinking about smokes and habits.  I highly recommend reading at least half of it. 

I lurked on this sub for about 6 months until I got the courage to quit. Seeing other people succeed made me realize I could do it too.  I thank everyone that came before me here from the bottom of my heart. You all rock.

I wasn‚Äôt as bold as you guys, and didn‚Äôt have whatever it takes to draw a line in the sand and declare a quit day. Just thinking about that gave me anxiety.  My plan was to eventually quit one day with a hangover. My boyfriend and I would have the occasional Friday night drink-and-smoke bender and I‚Äôd feel so awful afterwards I wouldn‚Äôt smoke all day Saturday. That would give me a free day of those dreaded first 3 days. So, I sort of followed my plan and quit after being laid up with dental surgery.

My biggest motivation to quit was to keep living. After 30 years of smoking I‚Äôd wake up feeling bad, and the rest of the day wasn‚Äôt much better. Earlier this year my adult children's father passed away unexpectedly and I've been helping them through that hurt.  I can't let them lose another parent right now. 

I downloaded the ‚ÄòSmoke Free‚Äô app and open it multiple times a day. I come here and read posts, I breathe deep through cravings, drink water, chew gum or have a hard candy as a reward, and repeat my mantra. And I now wake up feeling GOOD!  I handle cravings and when they pass I feel even stronger for beating them and taking control.  I have hope for a good future, and not a future filled with sickness and coughing and feeling bad.   It's only been 10 days, but I think my mind is in the right place to get this done.",25,0

I finally got a decent job today after a year of being out of college and was ready to celebrate. I called my dad to tell him the news and he was over joyed. Then the conversation took a dark turn. He had spoken with an old friend of his for the first time in a few years to see how life was going, and his friend told him he was going under the knife for lung cancer. My dad then told me about everyone he's known who has died from smoking: friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, even his own father. 

To preface, my dad is one of the strongest men I know. He's a war hero and dedicated father who's days away from retirement. I've only seen him cry once when we put down our dog, but today he was breaking up on the phone to me talking about this. 

He said ""I know your young and it's your body, but if you were to give me any (birthday) present, I'm begging you, please quit."" I couldn't hold it together and I've been in a daze since the call.

I've recently gone through some negative turns in life. After college, I moved away from my friends and a state I've grown to love to return to a state I've hated since I was a child. I've been working a job which didn't even pay the bills. I got a DUI last month commiserating with my brother since he will be losing his job at the end of the year. I've since been trying to cut out drinking, but it's been difficult as hell. According to the state, I'm not allowed to drive for the next 6 months and I must seek therapy, which I can't afford.  Life has kinda sucked until I found out I was getting this job. 

Smoking is one of the few things I still had left. Whether you call it a crutch or an addiction, it was the last thing I could do to feel like me. It helps me socialize or take a break from the world. Now, I can't have it any more. I don't want to hold Phillip Morris over my father, but I know I can't truly quit until I've decided to.

That's the abridged version. 

Now here's the unabridged version:

I've smoked since I was 17, and it was a total accident that I slipped into addiction. I never saw it coming, until I would get throat infections OFTEN! I would smoke through the sickness. That's a good example of an addiction being so persistent in the fibers of your being, that you'll make yourself not only sick, but even sicker.

I'm now 27, and that didnt cross my mind until just now that it's been ten years with nicotine. 

My first attempt at quitting smoking was great! My friend and I drunkenly threw each others' packs into the street when we were hammered, and woke up the next day to a new competition. ""Whoever breaks first, is a ~loser~"" we both barely remembered it, but were so stubbornly competitive, that we both complied to the new game.

I had been vaping then too, but it was so easy to cut that one out (not a juul) because it was so finicky, and would break, and leak all the time. So the next day when I didnt have smokes,* and* my vape broke, I snapped it literally in half, and said ""eff the vape for sure"". I threw it away, and honestly never looked back at nicotine until one day.

One day about 1.5 years into that, my car got demolished by a drunk driver, and to cope with the sight, the smell, and that chaos.... I took up smoking again. Other really stressful things were going on too, and I was not looking back.. :(

Fast forward a bit to a little more than a year ago. The guy at my smoke shop raved about juul, and said it helped him quit. That seemed great to me, so I got myself a starter pack. I was into the ease of use with the pods. I was not a fan of the price. And the frequency I was using them :/ so for the new year, I had decided that I wanted to be done with the juul...ok... 11 months in and I'm finally getting to it. 

I lost my darn juul stick for the last time last monday. I looked pretty incessantly... but alas, it was no where. So... I think to myself, ""would it really be that bad, or scary if you just stopped altogether?"" Turns out yess... it was bad, and still is. 

I'm on edge, constantly, my mood is flat, but yet i'm grumpy and irritable. You know what's keeping me going, though, friend? The fact that I dont look like a fiend with my little USB stick; the fact that I'm going to save (I kid you not) $200 a month...$2,400 a year; That I dont have to keep my addiction constantly charging all day long.

I'm putting that money in a seperate account from my savings, and who knows what I'll be able to do with it. 

So yeah... my moods is wretched right now. At least I feel like I'm winning at something :)",12,1

I tried a few things, namely reading Butt Out. Found it great, prepped to quit. Quit day came. Lasted hours until I was in a manic depressive state and smoking again. Not cool. Unlike me.

So I put it down to some external circumstances and said I'd try a week later. All prepped. Quit day came. Lasted hours until I was in a manic depressive state and smoking again. So uncool.

So I finally caved and after 11 years of smoking and trying to quit, I went and got prescribed Champix. And actually, although I was worried that it would make me super suicidal (my mum had that with them years ago), I've been on them for about ten days, feeling fine. I get nauseous, sometimes really bad, upon taking them, but even worse if I smoke on them. It's put me off. I genuinely don't want cigarettes because I've reprogrammed already to smoking equals insane nausea.

I'm so relieved I can't explain. I didn't set a quit date this time, but I haven't smoked in 30 hours without a hitch because that last wave of nausea was so fucking intense I just don't want to feel that way. And I was 40 rollies a day, easy, for a long time!

I definitely love the ritual of smoking, but I cannot be a servant to my smoking addiction anymore. Once I stopped for a year, once for six months, once for a year and a half.

This summer I was on a backpacking trip and ended up staying in Greece for three months (June-August), where I started smoking again after a smoke-free year and a half. I was having an absolute blast, freedom, no serious responsibility and honestly just hardcore enjoying life. 10-15 was the average amount of cigarettes a day I would say.

I stopped smoking 4 or 5 days ago (trying not to count). It is now extremely clear to me how strong this addiction can be. The previous times I quit were, for some reason, bearable experiences. Two to three days of physical cravings and some minor lingering mental distress afterwards. However, this time I have gone through such an immense range of physical sensations and mental games. Sometimes it feels like my body is trying to jump out of its own skin. Sometimes I have to fidget around and kind of just let myself be crazy until a craving passes. Sometimes I feel like I have lost my best friend. Flashes of ""where has my confidence gone?"". My mind is constantly deceiving itself. The fact that at some points during the day I feel like lighting up a cigarette would actually be better for me than continuing to be smoke-free is so eye-opening to the powerful hold cigarettes have on me. I am doing my best to keep a healthy perspective on this experience and for now breathing deep, not being too hard on myself and trying to take it day by day. Everyday I have the choice to smoke or not smoke. I just want to say that I have respect for anyone who takes on this challenge because it is no joke.

I'm not someone who likes to bombard my friends with stuff like this, but I need to talk about it to people who can relate because it is the main event of my life right now.",26,0

So I've quit many times, and to be honest I really thought the last time was my last. But here I am after a booze and cigarette fueled 2 weeks. 

My quit periods have been months at a time, but I always seem to let that cruel mistress back in. 

The problem is I can go weeks and months, over come the cravings. Start to hate the smell, feel amazing, taste, work out, love the circulation levels in my body.

But I just go back, I think.  Yeah I want to.

So I find it ""easy"" to get to these improve ment levels. But then I just go again.

I don't know what it is exactly, it maybe the association with having fun (drinking, drugs).

I do enjoy having a smoke, but I also hate how it literally poisons me.

I'm just disappointed in my self for letting it back in and looking for any coping mechanism people got when they were a few months into the quit (this is where I struggle the most for the longest 2+ months)

I think I started to notice withdrawals at the 0.03mg/ml point, I dont know if it was placebo but I think the varenicline helped cushion the withdrawals so they wernt so bad, ill probably continue to take it for a few more days till im sure I wont go back on the nicotine

Screening is the idea of looking for the disease when you don't have symptoms to catch it early with the hope of early treatment and better outcomes. Medicare and private insurances should cover it if you meet the guidelines.

You can go to the [American Lung Association's - Saved By the Scan](https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/saved-by-the-scan/) and take their eligibility quiz as well as get more info. I would encourage anyone who is eligible to do this as this can literally save your life. 

Here are the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines:

\-Ages 55 to 80 years

\-30 pack-year history of smoking

\-Current smoker **or** quit within past 15 years

\-Discontinue when person has not  smoked for 15 years or if limited life expectancy

\- Some orgs have slight variations such as age 50+ and 20 year pack history and another risk factor ( asbestos exposure, chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis)

Source:  [UpToDate Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines by Organization](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PULM%2F64078)  
\-----  
If you are having symptoms (or already have lung cancer) I would encourage you to talk to your doctor, as this is different and they may send you for a different type of scan.

I'm feeling so light headed and every time I take a walk and pass cigarette shops, my brain tries to justify an excuse to smoke.

I've moved out of my parents house after almost 3 years of extreme financial hardship. Things are not all that better now but they are certainly better. If I want to improve as a person and have better financial habits, I need total sobriety and to be smoke free.

I've always had a problem with poor impulse control. But it feels different this time. It is far too early to say but in the past, I would blame my ADHD and feel like I have ""no control"" over my self destructive habits. I'm practising mindfulness and meditation to change that. 

I am the master of my own destiny and nothing can hold me back from what I want to achieve. I am in control even if I believe I'm not. The human brain is the most powerful thing on this planet and to waste its potential is to waste my own life.

So now I'm fooling my brain into thinking that this withdrawal feeling is my new high. It definitely feels like a ""high"" because I feel like my head is in the clouds and only smoking tobacco will relieve that and keep me grounded. I don't need weed or cigarettes to control me. 

It's a little hard to explain but this feels like a battle with my conscious and subconscious mind. My conscious mind is denying my brain the temporary pleasure of a smoke and telling my brain about this new high. My subconscious mind is itching at the impulsivity and telling me ""no this fucking sucks can we have a cigarette or a joint please"". My brain is going to learn to love it no matter what.

For the past two, a pack would last me around 4 days unless I went out drinking. Last Thursday after coming home from a night out, I decided that I'll stop smoking. I threw away the last 7 cigarettes left in a pack and stopped.

I haven't felt a single craving...I believe at least. The only time I wanted to smoke was during brakes between classes in college but the urge wasn't really that big. It was more of a case of being bored and not knowing what to do during those 15 minutes.

My intention isn't to ""brag"", it really isn't. I'm just wondering how is it possible that after two years of regular smoking I'm not physically addicted.",5,0

Leaving cigarettes alone has motivated me to dig deep and let go of some other things that only give me negative vibes. For one, facebook and snapchat. This is very subjective and just for me but it's just so negative when I get on there and I get on literally every 5 minutes. Its mentally destructive for me that is.

Not so much to the smoking,"I had my first cigarette when I was 17. It was purely out of curiosity, no bad influences. I always thought of myself as having good self-control, never imagined I would get hooked to anything, especially something like a cigarette that smelt and felt like crap to inhale. 10 years later, here I am, having made a complete fool of myself.

For the first 5 years, it was never regular, just something fun to do with college buddies when we headed out, maybe once or twice a month. This reinforced my idea that it wasn't something I would get dependent on. I was also not in the USA then, so we didn't have to buy whole packs for getting a single smoke. So we could just have our single (often shared) and be done with it, until later.

It was for the last 5 years that I got along with smoker-company at work and started off a daily habit. This soon became a crutch. I've since moved away from there, and now I'm a smoker all by myself, keeping up the regularity. In my current state, I'm a complete closet smoker. I always drive to a secluded spot to smoke, so no one sees me smoking. After every single smoke, I also go through an elaborate cleansing process of washing my hands, mouth, and face with soap. Just to make sure that no one smells it on me, because I feel guilty to admit that I'm a smoker. My coworkers don't know that I smoke (they may have smelt it on me at times, but are decent enough to not interrogate me about it). My family doesn't know either. My wife knows, but I have never smoked in front of her. Ever.

I smoke about 4-5 a day now (Marlboro Gold/lights). I know that isn't as severe as a pack-a-day habit, I may be considered a 'casual' smoker by some. But I am completely dependent on it. More precisely, I lack any kind of control over my smoking. I have tried to identify my triggers, but have failed. It could be just about anything. Felt a little off? Smoke. Got too much work? Smoke. Tension in personal life? Smoke. About to get some food? Smoke. After food? Smoke. Just woke up? Smoke. Going to sleep? Smoke. Basically, any change in the state-of-mind makes me want to get a smoke. After I finish writing this up and posting it, I will drive out for a smoke.

I also blame having to buy a 20-pack in order to get just one smoke. So then I have to hold on to it and give myself easy access to another 19 cigarettes. I have also bought packs and got disgusted and thrown out the rest. There are way too many 19 packs in dump yards, thanks to me. I have had many cigarettes that were supposed to be my 'last-smoke-ever'.

I tried to give it all up by setting up a plan to go from 4 a day to 2 a day, then 1 a day, and then none. I brilliantly fucked it up by smoking 10 at the 1-a-day stage, because my bike broke down in the middle of the road. I tried vapes & Juul, it seemed to work a little, but I got back to the good old burnt plant. I've not had any medical issues so far. I'm not keen on starting any quit-smoking or replacement therapies either. I believe it is completely in my head, and I should be able to regain control of my habits if I put my mind to it. When I'm around family, I'm easily able to go for a week or even a month without smoking. So it should be possible for me to control it on my own too, right?

I'm not a fan of quitting smoking completely. I think I still want to enjoy a puff with friends if we're out drinking. I just want to get rid of my dependency. I still think that the 'addiction' is all in my head.

I have just freshly downloaded a copy of the book - Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. I don't have high hopes for it, but I'm not sure where else to go for help. My wife is kind enough to be patient with me, she never brings it up or nags me about it.

Do I sound reasonable in my approach? Is it even practical to think that I'll just be able to have complete control, and smoke ONLY when I decide to? (by that, I mean smoking on very rare occasions, maybe 1 a month just for fun)

Thanks a lot for your advice and support. This sub is great source of inspiration.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr - I'm a regular smoker who wants to give up the habit. I depend on the cigarettes to get through my day. Yet, I'm too proud to admit that I have a real problem. I need a way to take this a little more seriously so that I stop before it's too late.",4,0

He mentions numerous times in his book that the EASYWAY method has a success rate of 90%, which as he points out, would make it by far the most effective smoking cessation method available. He even goes as far to suggest that doctors who recommend pharmacologic options such as nicotine replacement or chantix over his method should be charged with malpractice. While I personally think the EASYWAY is another great tool for smokers looking to quit, it is NOT what he and his disciples have made it out to be. 

For starters, his 90% figure is based entirely on his ""money back"" guarantee. In other words, only 10% of people who buy his book or other materials end up contacting his company for a refund, and he uses that figure to make the assumption that every one of the other 90% must have successfully quit smoking. That's preposterous. 

For the longest time, there were no quality scientific studies that evaluated the efficacy of Alan's methods- until last year when the Irish government conducted a randomized control trial involving 300 participants- half of whom used the EASYWAY method, and half of whom used a service called Quit.ie which is an online portal with lots of informative materials. In one sense, the trial was a victory for EASYWAY; it was found to be roughly twice as effective as Quit.ie at all checkpoints. But the key finding was the quit rates themselves. For the EASYWAY method the quit rates were as follows: at 1 month: 38%, 3 months: 27%, 6 months: 23%, 1 year: 22%

As a comparison- nicotine patches, chantix, and nicotine patches + lozenges had 1 year quit rates of 21%, 19%, and 20% respectively (according to a 2016 randomized trial involving 1086 smokers). 

So, Carr's method is roughly equivalent to the most common pharmacologic options. Like I said, I believe it should be considered one of the best tools we have. But the claims made by Carr and his company are completely dishonest.

I decided to see how many days have passed since the last day I smoked a cigarette. I can't believe it has been this long, and I have to wonder the last time I checked this subreddit. I write to you all today to let you know it's the easiest and hardest thing I have ever done. 

It's a no brainer to quit smoking! Everyone knows they need to quit, everyone knows the negatives, everyone feels the effects like suffocated lungs and coughing. It is the easiest conclusion, just quit. 

But it was the hardest 10 day period I have ever surpassed. I quit cold turkey. I didn't sleep for two days initially, and my anxiety was crazy for even longer. However, after that third/fourth day, every day afterwards is easier. 

I think that what helped me was browsing r/stopsmoking and constantly reading about the benefits of quitting smoking. My motivation grew, and my strength to stand up to the addiction grew. After 100 days, I basically never thought about cigarettes again. (Sidenote - If you're feeling sad about quitting, nearly depressed, its because smoking tobacco may have anti-depressant like qualities: [Smoking may mimic effect of antidepressants](https://www.bmj.com/content/323/7315/713.1.extract))

Recently, I started vaping with my friends Juuls and vapes. I love them, it started when I was drunk, and led me to vaping at work at lunch with coworkers. After wanting it everyday, I realized it was a dangerous path. I quit that about two months ago as well. 

I want to thank everyone on the subreddit for the support. I absolutely love the changes I have made mentally, and physically by quitting. I run, bike, snowboard, lift as much as possible. I have grown the motivation and drive to accomplish everything I want. I have grown exponentially in every way I needed. This is all due to quitting

I‚Äôm 24 yrs old, I started smoking on september 2018 and quitted 10 days ago. Not so long compared to other people, but it was a while I had in mind to quit. It was a bad decision taken in a very stressful moment of my life and working in a place where basically everyone smokes led me to it, even to fit in a bit more, since I was ‚Äúthe new guy‚Äù and my shy personality didn‚Äôt help me that much.
Well, I reached my goal, but now I want to get rid of it for good; first week was ok, but in the past two days I‚Äôm starting to have bigger cravings, generically when I‚Äôm at work. I thought that maybe vaping with 0mg nicotine could be an option... is it though?

389,2019-11-14 00:51:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/dw5377/finally_reached_a_month/,Finally reached a month.,"This is the longest I've ever been without a cigarette. And I cant even enjoy it. My dental issues showed up right when I stopped. I thought it was withdrawl. It was a tooth infection. Tooth is good, just an old nerve that was missed because it was a fish hook type nerve. Go back for a crown next week. The pain has me like f it, imma hurt rather I smoke or not then I think about how much my mouth has changed. What if I ignored the sleeping problems I had when smoking. I used to lose my breath in my sleep when I smoked. Had to sleep on my side. My gums have started turning pink again. I guess I picked a good time to stop because I had a decayed nerve in me and an infection(tho I didnt get the fever, swelling and other extremes). Things I was blind to. But I've been in so much misery all month, it's hard for me to celebrate. It's hard to be happy about because my mouth is in constant discomfort. I never had dental issues until I started smoking. I dont blame the cigarettes, I blame me. They warned me. I chose not to listen.


My pastor is a Vietnam Vet. He was someone I admired my whole life. He was short like me. He survived the 60s. He was a war vet. Strong and firm in his position. He made church fun. Now, he is a shadow of himself. A high spirited and passionate man that is slowed down by an iron lung.


I made this decision for my son because I never had a dad. I didnt have someone to answer my questions about who I was. Or show me how to work on a car. Or come to my game. But my son has that.....the way I feel when I see him......its the one thing in life I've done RIGHT. HE is why I let the cigarettes go. So he can have his daddy. I just wish I could enjoy it but for now I have dental issues that prevent that but I'm blessed to have doctors that truly care, a job with decent insurance, a little money stashed for this, a great support system from my family, and most of all for me(its ok if you believe different)my faith in a higher power. Just some rainy days.



Congrats to you on whatever part of the journey you're on. It's very much worth it. For you, your family, your peace of mind. You deserve it. Its hell but there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it's you as a non smoker.

TL;DR- Upset about dental issues that appeared after my cessation. But happy I made a month, my longest stretch",7,2

Fell off the bandwagon.  I quit cold turkey for over 6 months, and then October hit, went to a birthday where drinks were involved and everyone in that group smoked.  Well, I went out for one... then 2 then it just started being more frequent.   It has been over a month I have caved and made poor excuses for myself. The reason I quit smoking was because my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer, and quite frankly, smoking was getting old and in the way of a lot of things.

&#x200B;

I am upset with myself, because I know how good it felt being smoke-free. The smell, the feeling, the energy and time I had extra of.  Last night, for example, I sat outside all night smoking and scrolling through my phone. I chain smoked until I felt sick and it still did not feel like enough. 

&#x200B;

My fianc√© hates the smoking but has been by my side to help me with it. The unfortunate thing about this time, is that he knows I have sort of gotten back into it, but he doesn't know the extent.  I basically go for lunch at work, and I drive to another parking lot to puff the nasty. I pull over before I get home, to have one or two, and then go through the regime of spraying myself with body sprays, smelly hand sanitizers, gum and all.  I don't even know why I am smoking again. I keep telling myself there are no pros to it, but this self destructive side of me just keeps trying to control me.  I have also used cannabis as a huge crutch, and I need to stop that as well. I am becoming a basket case again. I cannot sit for the life of me, I have to keep doing things and keep moving (this is also because I have arthritis and moving seems to be the best medicine I can find) and it is very hard for me to relax.

My mother passed away of lung cancer back in 2009 and she was a very heavy cigarette smoker, and after her passing i moved away from home to a city with a huge middle eastern population (i'm middle eastern myself) and i got introduced to smoking Hookah (argeeleh) which is a device that uses wet tobacco and filters the smoke through water. I've been told it's much more worse than cigarettes. It helped me relieve stress and made me mellow out and helped my anxiety, but i needed to use it every day. Its a social device so its meant to be shared amongst people but i never shared mine, i would smoke it all myself daily. One night in January of 2019 i was sitting with my friends in my living room, all of us smoking out own hookahs, and i just put my hose down and said "" i think i'm done"" and i haven't smoked it since, it is now Nov 13th, 2019 and im approaching almost a whole year without it and i can honestly say it has changed my life. I wasn't even planning on quitting or anything, i just sort of did it. I was gaining weight at an alarming rate, my social circle was growing smaller and i was getting more and more unhappy with myself and i decided to make a change. As soon as i stopped smoking, i started working out and dieting, taking care of my health, performing better at work, moved out of my shitty apartment in the ghetto of Detroit. I moved to a very very nice neighborhood into a beautiful home and everything is coming together slowly but surely. I cant promise that this is going to happen to everyone but my point is, you have the power and ability to make any of the changes in your like that you want to. Whether it be to quit smoking, lose weight, find a hobby, leave an unhappy relationship, better yourself in anyway, you just have to take the first step. It's like going swimming in a lake, you will never get comfortable in the water if you tip toe on the edge, you have to just dive in. I hope my story was able to help some of you, If you need any advice or just need someone to talk to, please feel free to inbox me or respond to this post.

\*EDIT\* I also wanted to add that with my lifestyle change, i was able to convince my two older sisters to stop smoking as well as their husbands, we turned it into a family journey to honor my late mother. So far no one has fallen off the wagon, and Its been nothing but love and support from our friends and families. It's a harsh journey but once you get on the other side, its a whole new world full of tasting foods again, smelling clean air, no bad breath, no more yellow fingertips, no more cotton mouth. and no more of the social stigma attached to ""smokers""",20,0

After 20 days quit I caved and smoked while out for a friend's birthday. I discovered that I could smoke then stop again whenever I felt like it. I want on this way for 9 months. Smoking on the weekends, then stopping again very easily. I thought I had outsmarted my addiction.
 Then in early September I had a very exciting period of time. During this time I craved cigarettes more and more until I became a full blown smoker again. I had said ""to start smoking again full time I would have to be severely depressed"". It turned out the opposite was true. For the past two months I have tried to quit smoking weekly, even daily some weeks. Falling into the same trap every time. 
It never used to make me feel sick. Now, all it does is disgust me and make me feel sick. I tried different times of the day. Different days in the week. Each time falling into the same trap again. 
My biggest trigger is leaving work. I will go a full 24 hours cigarette free but walk into a corner store and get cigarettes on my way home. I'll only smoke from 3-6pm then throw the cigarettes out and carry on fine without them again for another 20 hours. Now I understand why they say never another puff, no matter what.

Its been 2 years since I quit.,"2 years and 20 days back, I was having a bad wheezing attack and though that I would die that night. Somehow I managed to get into the car and drive myself to the nearest urgent care facility where they put me on nebulizer to control my wheezing. That was the last time I smoked. Can't belive it has already been two years. Time Flies!

I still get an urge to smoke every once in a while, but these are very weak urges more like a casual thought asking myself to smoke that can be easily avoided. 

My morning cough continued for almost an year after quitting smoking. For a while I thought that after 25 years of smoking, I would be stuck with morning cough and sneezing permanently. But all the cough is now gone and health wise I feel as good as new. I don't get as much cold and flu as I used to while smoking and the one time that I got flu it went away real fast (like within 2 or 3 days).

Those who are struggling to quit, I hope you keep up with it. Even if you can't quit now, keep trying. try breaking the habit like if you smoke right after getting up in the morning, wait 20 minutes after getting up before smoking. If you smoke right after dinner, wait 15 minutes before smoking. At least in my case I think breaking the habit helped a lot before I finally quit after the wheezing attack.

I stopped smoking after 25 years and I count it as one of the biggest achievement in my life. My health and quality of life has improved tremendously. I no longer feel tired, my mood is much more brighter now as opposed to feeling craggy all the time while I was smoking. I also feel much more cleaner and confident at work and don't have to worry about if I am smelling of cigarettes etc.

You have quit smoking and are trying to keep it that way. I stop by this site once a year, after quitting absolutely four (4) years ago. Count 'em, four (4) years. Not one puff. I stop by to show it can be done.

* Don't wait till New Years to quit smoking. Start 2020 with success already behind you.
* You cannot have one puff. Okay just one. Not! No, not one puff. If one puff is okay, then two is okay, and you're down the hole all over again.
* Quitting means turning one thousand ""stones"" or thoughts. I quit a hundred times before I got it right. Each time I failed, I learned a bit more about the challenges of quitting an addiction. Now I am mentally much stronger and resilient, and that pay off in all kinds of ways, e.g., healthy eating, fitness, etc.
* 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months. That's what it takes. 3 days of physical withdrawal symptoms. 3 weeks of changing your routines and mental associations, e.g., I smoke at break. 3 months for those lingering feelings, when you imagine that smoking is nice; it's a trick from your nicotine brain.
* When you are in a real tough spot with quitting, play the ""tape"" or ""script"" forward. I.e., you know what happens next. You break down, have one smoke, feel a short ""relief"" which is only a temporary relief from the effort of quitting, then you feel like crap for smoking, and have to quit all over again. Play this ""tape"" forward, and it will be easier to avoid smoking.
* Do I think about smoking? Sure, every now and then I remember than I used to smoke. It seems weird, like an illness I used to have but it's gone. I do not crave cigarettes.
* Breathing freely is really nice. It is its own reward every single day.

Best to you all! If you were around four years ago, be sure to say hi.",119,0

I am currently on day 7 after quitting cold turkey on Monday. This is my second time quitting and last time I was smoke free for 2 months. this time the experience is entirely different and I was very determined from the start to quit. i seem to have no cravings whatsoever except for the odd one here and there that are really easy to shake off. Despite this, however, it's taken quite the toll on my mental health. I am constantly depressed, I find myself crying all the time without apparent reason, I have no energy mental or physical, and I also had a couple of panic attacks which I hadn't had for a year before now.  I understand that mood swings come with the package of quitting, but I'm very confused since I didn't get any of this last time I quit and since I don't actually miss smoking, so it makes me wonder if it's unrelated to smoking and there's something wrong with me. 
Does anyone have any similar experiences? If so please share, it would put my mind at ease so I don't keep thinking I'm going crazy.

I've been nicotine free and vape free for maybe two months now, I haven't been counting the days, just guessing. I enjoy being able to breath better and I cough so much less, its fantastic. 


Besides craving a cigarette after a large hearty meal and just randomly for maybe 10 min at a time through the day, I have no desire to smoke because the smell of my girlfriends cigarettes are a constant reminder how nasty they are.


Anyway, I am having some problems  with some things that have replaced my smoking habit. I chew on my mustache a lot a measure it with my fingers and I cant stop, I just want all the hair on my face to be symmetrical. I used to chew my nails really short too and to my surprise I have actually stopped doing it as much since I grew a beard and quit vaping. It seems like one habit is just replacing the other. Also, I've been getting a little depressed maybe once a week, could this be because of quitting smoking? I never understand why I'm sad when its happening so I just assumed it was the lifestyle change.

It has been pretty smooth up to this point. I would have occasional moments when I was driving to work where the urge would come up, but it passed after a few moments of reminding myself I didn't need it. I would drive by a gas station I would stop at for smokes often, and just keep going. At work, at break time I just sat down and bullshitted with the other guys and never once stepped outside. I would open my smoker app and see how far I had come and remind myself how far I could go. When I got home in the evenings, I would have a slightly stronger urge, but I kept busy and waited for it to pass.


Today was my first full day off of work, and I just can't shake this feeling. I keep wanting to drive to the convenience store and buy a pack. I tell myself I won't,  and I try to distract myself and tell myself this feeling will go like the rest of them, but it keeps growing stronger. Then I start bargaining with myself, ""just buy a pack, smoke one. Remind yourself how awful it is."" But I know how much guilt that will cause, I know how slippery that slope is. I don't want to keep trying to quit, I want to actually quit. I know in the grand scheme of things that one shitty day is nothing, but I also know that one shitty day can be my undoing. I'm fighting this feeling as hard as I can, and I've been narrowing it out all day, I hope I can stay a step in front.

I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 16, I‚Äôm 31 now. I am/was a total nicotine addict, at my worst I was smoking a pack a day, smoked a vape in between cigs after they came out. I‚Äôve always thought that there was no way I would ever be able to quit. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened. I‚Äôve tried to quit before but never, ever made it more than 3-4 days. But I was out on the patio smoking a cig with my wife and I just decided I wasn‚Äôt what I wanted anymore. But I knew I was going to have an uphill battle and I‚Äôve tried everything, patches, gums, nothing works. 

I got a disposable vape. 5% nicotine. I found a vape I liked and ran with it. Over the course of a week or so, I tapered off the number of cigarettes per day until I was only smoking the vape. After a week, I dropped to 3.6% nicotine pods. Another week, I dropped to 2.3%. 9 days ago, I took the big plunge. I got a non-disposable vape, some 0% nicotine oil, and 150mg CBD oil from a reputable vendor. 

Its been 9 days... swapping from cigs to a vape was pretty easy, but going to zero nicotine has been hell. Hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. But just 9 days... the cravings are getting noticeably fewer. Easier to overcome. I only hit the zero nicotine/CBD vape maybe 4-5 times a day now. CBD was absolutely a huge, huge help. When the really bad cravings hit, the CBD gives the same stress relief and body relaxation that nicotine did, and I don‚Äôt have the same addictive affects with CBD that I did with nicotine. 

My body feels so much better. I can breathe so much easier. I have so much more energy, and sex with my wife is so much better. 9 days sounds like such a short time, but it took me almost a month to put myself in a position to be ready for these 9 days, and I think very few can really understand how long those 9 days really are.

I understand that nicotine is highly addictive and that you are subject to a certain amount of dependence upon consumption. 

I spend no money on cigarettes or nicotine products. I don't struggle with withdrawal symptoms (to the best of my knowledge) barring the occasional headache following a party, and I am in good health and make a point to specifically exercise my cardiovascular system.

Day 45, no more cravings, I am strong like steel. 

One of my biggest fear that held me back from starting quitting was possible weight gain, but I realized that smoking is a bigger threat and if I can deal with smoking then after that I can gain back my old weight as well. I knew that it is almost impossible to deal with quitting and any kind of food restriction or diet at the same time.

I had been gaining weight during the first 3 weeks because I wanted to reward myself for my efforts. :-)

I guess it helped a lot but I knew that it could be dangerous because of the slower metabolism. But it was OK, I had to pay the price. Not surprisingly I gained 3 kg. (I anticipated more by the way.) When I felt myself stronger I started to count my calorie intake. At first it was hard and I cheated a lot. But today I saw that I lost my first kg. I am really happy.

But the point is here:

Thanks all of you for the support. Keep fighting and we can do it.

I've had dreams of smoking and then quitting before I wake up. I've never stopped wanting a cigarette. I was just able to reason with myself and move on. 

But for some reason this passed month, I feel really unsettled. The same unsettled I'd feel whenever I haven't had a cigarette in a few hours and don't know what to do with myself. 

I had an anxiety attack today. That's not new. I've always had them. I had them for half my life. I got through them all the last 4 years without a cigarette. 

The only thing I can think of is that I'm no longer breastfeeding. I quit smoking when I got pregnant and then breastfed for 3 years. Now I'm not nursing (since September), I really want to start smoking again. I'm not going to. But it's making it hard to cope with anxiety. 

How do I avert relapse and when does the want to smoke finally go away for good?",11,0

I‚Äôm new here but I wanted to make a post because I wanna feel like I‚Äôm doing this with other people! I‚Äôm using a vape to help me quit cigs because I‚Äôve done this before and I managed to quit a vape pretty easy afterwards, I only started smoking again that time because ALL of my friends smoked. 
With my vape confession out of the way:

I wasn‚Äôt planning on quitting, but I saw that there were stoptober deals in the vape shop so I went in and got a decent one on a whim last week, not knowing if I‚Äôd use it. Yesterday, I woke up and had the last cig out of my packet, and then decided to do it. I then went out with my sister planning to switch straight to the vape, but I‚Äôd left the vape at home so I had one roll up from my sister while we were out. But I didn‚Äôt buy any more cigs! I got home and tried out the vape, and now it‚Äôs been about 23 hours since my last cig. I dropped my sister at the train station this morning, and she offered me a drag, and I was about to but I actually found the smell to be off putting, I didn‚Äôt expect that so soon. This feels different to the times I‚Äôve quit in the past. I tried cold turkey about 6 months ago but I didn‚Äôt even get out of bed for a whole day because the thought of getting up and not going for a cig was torture so I‚Äôm not keen to try that again.

I‚Äôve only been smoking for about 5 years but I‚Äôm sure like you guys I really associate smoking with certain things so I found it really hard to stop. Like I said before, I stopped for a while in the past but everyone around me smoked. I‚Äôm living with my mum temporarily and she smokes about 30 a day but she wants to get a vape at the weekend and quit with me. But with her smoking around me at the moment, I‚Äôm not even tempted. So far. I‚Äôve had a couple of cravings for what a cig does that a vape doesn‚Äôt, but I just tell myself I‚Äôm doing the exact same thing. And then I remind myself that there are literally no benefits to smoking. I haven‚Äôt told any of my long distance friends because I want to surprise them when I see them next, and that thought is keeping me going! I‚Äôm going on holiday in January, which might prove a challenge, but I have faith that I can do it. 

Anyway, sorry for what turned out to be a long post, I just felt like I needed to get these thoughts out somewhere! Hope everyone‚Äôs having a great day!",19,0

I've quit before, twice (both times 2+ years), but this time *feels* different (on day 6). Previously, I would get cravings and had to live through them until eventually they would subside. But, both times I fell off the wagon.

The main problem, for me, was the idea that smoking is somehow relieving anxiety and depression. When things get tough, when I get sad or stressed, I would go out and have a smoke or two, and feel relaxed. 

I have finally understood, internalized the workings of the nicotine trap. Many years ago I read Allen Carr's work on this, and he mentions over and over again how **smoking only relieves the stress caused by the previous cigarette**. For some reason, even though I understood what he meant by this, the concept hadn't sit with me, and it was the cause for all my quits and attempts to bring so much suffering. 

But now I got it, and this time my quit is almost completely effortless (I do get an occasional feeling, as if something's missing, but it goes away quickly and I have no desire to smoke).

I always thought quitting smoking means staying away from a chemical that relieves my anxieties, that relaxes me and makes the stress go away. This is not true.

When you're a non-smoker and life throws lemons at you - you deal with the lemons. Make a lemonade, or handle them in another way.

When you're a smoker and life throws lemons at you - you have another set of lemons, the ones from smoking. And these lemons are always there, no matter how your life is going at the moment. So you first need to handle the smoking-related stress (that wouldn't normally be there), and then deal with the actual stress life puts on you.

There is an **additional layer of stress** that smoking creates. And all a cigarette does is relieve symptoms of that additional stress. **It has no calming effect on your original stress**. Quitting smoking means getting rid of completely needless stress. 

Sorry for slightly longer post. I just feel so happy I finally got here, and wanted to share. :)",109,0

We did not drink together for so long so we were aiming to get super drunk. After some time and lots of drinks, we joined another group in the next table. Now, my friends knew that I quitted smoking, but the new guys did not know. In the absence of my friends, I asked one of the guys for a cig, and stared at it. Then I put the cigarette on my mouth and lighted the lighter. However, I did not light the cigarette. The lighter was standing in my hand away from the cigarette. I looked at it like half a minute and thought about all the reasons why I did not want to smoke it. Then I put the lighter back on the table and gave the guy his cigarette back. He looked at me like I was a weirdo, but it is worth not smoking one more cigarette. 

The reason I am telling this is that I was in a near-blackout drunk stage, but I still refused to smoke. This brought a great confidence-boost to me. If I refused to smoke in that condition then I could refuse it easily when I was sober. I feel so great right now for not sinking to that hole again and I just wanted to share it, because someone may get motivated by this.",117,0

Firstly, I love this sub. You all are so supportive of one another. Keep it up. 

So I managed to do a 10 day stint of no smoking. I started when I was 14 and picked it up daily 5 years ago. I'm 24 now. 

I always said I would not be 25 and smoking, which I still reckon is highly possible. This most recent quit (also cold turkey which will be the only way I'll quit next time), I got through some major triggers- drinking, friends who smoke, stressful situations etc. 

I picked it up today again and ofcourse, the guilt is very present. I am currently working 2 jobs, studying and finishing up a course. Although perhaps an 'excuse' but smoking really splits up my day. Next year, hopefully, my life is looking significantly more simplified.

At the minute I feel like now, quitting is just impossible. I'm around smokers all the time and quitting is not something I want to stress about.  I have a question or two, how did you choose when to quit? Do you reckon there was a 'right time'? How did you plan ahead if you quit at pretty demanding segments of your lives?

Cigarettes vs tobacco leaf (grabba/fronto).,"I myself am in the middle of quitting right now, I am 23 days smoke free and very proud of how far I've come! I've been using NRT this time around as well as the quitsmoking app. This is long and if you don't feel like reading there is a TLDR at the bottom.

I have a question for anyone that knows about/has smoked tobacco leaf vs cigarettes. Specifically a Jamaican tobacco called ""grabba"" or ""fronto"". I was a cigarette smoker before I met my fiance, I would also smoke weed but separately, when he found out that I smoked cigarettes he told me that it was important to him that I stop and he wasn't comfortable dating someone who smoked cigarettes. To ""help me quit"" he started mixing grabba in with our weed when we smoked because he believed smoking straight tobacco was healthier than cigarettes. 

It worked to a degree, I stopped smoking cigarettes but never stopped smoking tobacco since we were mixing grabba in with our weed. I started asking for it to be added every time we smoked, and I started craving more and more to be added. Like instead of a sprinkle, a joint was turning into half grabba half weed. Then I started craving it frequently which lead to us smoking weed (with grabba) constantly. It was easy to keep up at the time because we weren't working and had a break from college. Once it was no longer possible to smoke any time during the day, I started filling in the gaps with cigarettes again. 

To put grabba in perspective for those of you who haven't tried it, cigarettes were completely unsatisfying in comparison. I could smoke a cigarette and it felt like nothing, I didn't get the head rush I so craved or that calm feeling and smoking a cigarette just didn't cut it anymore. So clearly I was addicted to grabba and clearly it wasn't actually mush better for me (if at all) than cigarettes. Eventually my fiance got concerned with how much grabba we were smoking and how much I clearly craved it and wanted us to stop. I didn't want to stop but I knew he was right and I could feel in my lungs that I needed to stop, my lungs have never hurt from cigarettes as much as they hurt when I smoked grabba. I hated weed without grabba at this point, it felt pointless, and I realized I didn't care about getting high, I was using weed to get my grabba fix. I continued smoking cigarettes after we quit smoking grabba and the grabba quit was still pretty difficult. 

Now here's where I need some advice. My fiance's youngest sister is definitely addicted to grabba at this point. We used to smoke together all the time before my fiance and I got our own place together 2 years ago. I know that she's continued to consistently add grabba to her weed (which she smokes multiple times per day) over the course of the last two years. At this point I can tell she's addicted to it, she won't ever just smoke a green joint if we hang out together, she rolls a separate one for herself with lots of grabba every time. I'm not around her a lot anymore so I'm making a lot of assumptions based on my own experience but to me it's clear she's in deep since she no longer enjoys weed without grabba. I saw her last night and when no one was around she asked me if I miss smoking grabba, my answer was ""yes big time! I miss it a lot but \*fiance\* doesn't like it so I can't smoke it even occasionally"". Our conversation was cut short and when I was reflecting later I realized A. it was weird for her to bring it up and specifically ask me, which indicated she's thinking about stopping and B. I gave an answer that could make someone thinking about quitting pretty deterred and discouraged and it wasn't at all accurate. Really I don't miss it at all, it never ever crosses my mind day to day, I ONLY miss it when it's in front of me and I can see it and smell it and it's an immediate option to use. 

I messaged her when I realized what I'd done and clarified and made it clear that stopping is a very positive choice and I would encourage her to consider it. She appreciated my response for sure and expressed that she had asked because she's been thinking about it lately and is planning to stop by not buying more when she runs out of the batch she currently has. 

I haven't talked to her much about what to expect or the possible difficulties of smoking because I don't really know how hard it actually will be! My situation was different because I was also smoking cigarettes and when I quit grabba I was still smoking tobacco and getting nicotine. So should I treat her quitting grabba as equally as difficult to smoking cigarettes? Will she have similar craving responses and withdrawal symptoms? Should I recommend her to consider NRT or is she not even addicted to nicotine? Should I recommend her to try the quitsmoking app or is it too focused on cigarette specifics? (example, the health improvements it shows, are they even relevant to her?). I'm not sure if I should treat this similarly to a cigarette smoker/quitter and I don't want to tell her anything that's inaccurate.  

So how do you recommend I approach this with her, as someone who understands what it's like to quit smoking or as someone with a vague idea because the situations are not as similar as I thought.

TLDR; I smoked cigarettes and tobacco leaf (grabba) and quit grabba before quitting cigarettes. I've used a smokefree app with NRT to quit cigarettes. My fiance's sister is a heavy grabba user that mentioned wanting to quit in passing, I want to encourage her and share some strategies but I don't know how addicted she is, or how similar the quitting withdrawals and struggles will be since it is pure tobacco leaf vs cigarettes. If anyone knows much about the differences in any aspect I would appreciate some insight.",3,0

Even the feel of the air against my bare legs is hypersensitive, let alone the bed sheets. I barely slept last night. I just want a fucking cigarette.

I feel like I would have caved in already today if it wasn't for a couple of things I researched yesterday. The first is   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcosBFS7lA8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcosBFS7lA8)  this hypnosis is pretty good. It takes you to a fork in the road. The left fork is the choice to smoke, the right fork is the choice to remain a non-smoker. The hypnosis makes you imagine taking the decision to smoke, and makes you feel what it would be like to be smoking in one year, in five years and in ten years. I recoiled at the thought. The only thing worse that giving up smoking is the prospect of never, ever, ever giving up smoking.

The second thing is this research I read [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737394/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737394/) . It says the first 7 days of a quit attempt predicts the likelihood of success in quitting for good. Even one tiny little puff of smoking means you are statistically fucked in your quit attempt. I haven't gone through all this for nothing, the past five days feels like a lifetime. In the past I have always cheated a tiny bit here and there. And every time I've failed as is apparant by the fact I was smoking up until 5 days ago. I kind of just feel like if I wait til I have had a week of zero smoking, there will be a loophole right there, and if I cheat it won't affect my chances of giving up for good. But hopefully by the end of the week I will be feeling a lot stronger. Yesterday was the worst day. It gets easier and easier from here.

As of today, I want to give it another go but I need some tips. Like a big thing I'm worried about is that as exam season in university approaches, the temptation for a smoke will be strong, especially as people who dont even smoke normally would around this time i.e. people who dont usually smoke, outside the study areas  smoking thus making the idea of smoking seem harmless to my nicotine deprived brain. 

And what about these ""triggers"" everyone mentions on here? Feel like I've seen the word on various quit smoking sites, but it would probably resonate with me more coming from people I can believe in i.e. random people on Reddit.

About ten years ago, I had a job where I was going door-to-door trying get people to sign up for monthly donations to charities like The Red Cross. Most of the other guys were my age, and were smokers. They never pressured me into smoking, but I did feel left out whenever they would go outside to have a smoke. So, I bought a pack of cigarettes and soon enough, I was something I thought I'd never be: a habitual smoker. 

I eventually left that job, and with it went my smoking habit. I would occasionally smoke on and off for the next few years. My last cigarette for a while was in April of 2015. 

Then last September, for some stupid reason I bought a pack of cigarettes. And there I was again, a habitual smoker. My lowest point was deciding to throw away a pack into a public garbage bin that I and then going back to that garbage bin a few hours later to retrieve the pack of smokes. 

I knew I had to stop this before it became a real problem. So on November 1st of last year I threw away a pack in a garbage bin a very long distance from my house, late enough at night that it would be collected by a garbage truck by the time I was able to go back to get it. 

I've had to occasional craving, especially when I've been drinking. But I'm quite proud to say that in the last year, I haven't had one puff of a cigarette. I was never a heavy smoker which is why I  say one year isn't that impressive. I've been a non-smoker more than I've been a smoker in my life.

Haven't smoked nor do I feel the need to. I feel way more positive about this quit and 5 days in I haven't bitten anyone's head off.

There is never a good time to quit....",5,0

I feel a surreal amount of relief from knowing that I do not have to have that mental argument anymore.,"I started stealing my dad's cigarettes at the age of 14.  I used to skate board around bars looking for half smoked cigs to finish off (i know gross and stupid).


By 15 upperclassmen were buying me packs of cigs and it was taking me about a week or two weeks to finish them.  


Vapes came out and got me off the cigs while i was 16, but around age 17 i was consistently using both.

18 was a big milestone.  Not only could i legally smoke but i was also going on my senior trip.  Most people already knew, but now everyone knew, and the parents knew, and more importantly no one cared.  I smoked 25-30 cigarettes a day while in punta cana.


While on my trip I met a fellow addict but this gentlemen happened to be using a juul.  Not knowing anything about it, it instantly grasped my attention.


Coming home from vacation to track practice i realized i had damaged my lungs.  I vowed to quit smoking cigs in May of 2016.  


I used dip and the juul to break the cig habit and smoked my last cig November 2016 (3 years no cigarettes!)


Breaking the juul habit was one of the hardest things i dealt with.  I put it down in August of 2018 and picked up a vape that allowed me to pick the juice/nic concentration.  I weened from 50 mg all the way down to 0 by January of 2019.


But i never quit. I just stopped buying my own. I went full circle back to the original fiend I was, taking hits from friends and innocent strangers.


After realizing all of these things i told myself - you want to quit! It is not hard! And i told myself this every 10 min every day for the whole month of October in 2019.


I participated in Sober October, going 31 days without: drinking, social media, and nicotine!

It's now November 1st and I am free!


It's all love, much love to everyone in this sub, keep fighting.",55,0

19 CRAVING STOPPERS

From walnut on 4/6/2007 8:56:47 PM
--------------------------------------------------

1. When you're challenged by a strong urge to smoke, take a few deep breaths and remember your determination to be free.

2. Think of your most important reason for wanting to stop. Say it out loud in front of the mirror.

3. Do not start feeling sorry for yourself. It's the people who are still smoking who should be pitied. You were smart enough to follow a program and stop smoking.

4. Immediately turn your attention to something else. Remember that even the most intense craving lasts only a few minutes -- 5 or 10 at the most. The urge will pass whether you smoke a cigarette or not.

5. Do something with your hands. Knit. Doodle. Play with coins. Write a letter.

6. Be good to yourself in every possible way. Even indulge yourself a little. Enjoy a special treat on weekends (a good meal, a show, etc.) with the money you've saved.

7. Frequent places where you don't smoke rather than places where you do.

8. Curb use of alcohol and caffeine.

9. Seek the company of nonsmokers.

10. Concern yourself only with today--tomorrow will take care of itself. Get through today without smoking

11. Eat something! Low calorie snack, veggies, chew fresh ginger. Bite into a clove.

12. Talk to yourself! When the urge comes, say: ""Slow down. You're doing great. You can keep going.""

13. Distract yourself! Whistle! Sing! Brush your teeth! Work on a hobby! Take a shower.

14. Analyze! Do you think you need a cigarette as a reward to relieve boredom, or after an extended period of concentration? Find another way to take a break.

15. Move! Get up and walk around. Take a drink of water.

16. Practice relaxation exercises. Stretch, yawn, do deep knee bends, touch your toes, shrug your shoulders.

17. Make believe! Pretend you're smoking a cigarette. It's a very helpful breathing exercise.

18. Breathe! In and out, as if you actually had a lighted cigarette in your mouth. You will find that you are actually sighing!

19. Think of quitting as an act of love - for those you care about. It's also a gift to yourself.",32,0
666,2019-11-01 11:00:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/dq5dt1/1st_day/,1st day,"Hi, this is my first day without cigs. Its not the first time I try to quit, but i feel enthusiastic and i believe this will be the last. I 've been smoking since i was 16, now im 33 years old. Its been a long time and i can barely remember how is to be a non-smoker.I've been vaping, for a year until i came back to cigarettes six months ago.

Like every time i relapsed I understood there where things i had to learn to win this figth, then, when my mind was clear, I conclude that this time i learned  two things:

\-> vaping is a excuse for hiding the dust under the carpet, i doesn't solve the base problem that is nicotine addiction, and yes, of course that is healthier than smoking and nicotine doesn't give you cancer, but nicotine is changing your mood every time and making you anxious. There is no way that self respect and substance abuse can come together, it undermines your self-stem in unconscious ways on daily basis and that undermining makes you prone to taking more and more bad decisions in other areas. smoking is a little thing, but is a little thing you make everyday all the time and caps your progress in many ways.

\-> The good thing is that while i was vaping i could get a glimpse of what is to be a non smoker, there were days on which i felt fantastic, more energetic and in better mod because i wasn't feeling the vaping as self abuse. I can keep doing things after i came back from work because i wasnt tired yet. Now im back to potato couching and i hate it.

edit: i was reading a lot of tips in this sub last night, thank you in advance.

edit 2: English is not my native language, excuse me for all the shitty grammar.

Wish me luck.",7,0

I was once a smoker myself and am now closing in on my fifth year of being smokefree. Since then I've dedicated my time to help others overcome the obstacles I once faced in my own life a few years back. If you're interested in more about my story then check out my last post.  I'm now about to start consulting professionals who want to quit permanently but still need 1-3 more test clients in order to perfect my methods. The ones I'm currently working with have seen great results and are now smoke-free! So if YOU are;

* Just thinking about quitting
* Are in the beginning stages of your quit
* Have tried quitting before but relapsed

Then leave me a comment down below and we'll figure out exactly if and how I could help you out.

This week alone I've smoked about 3 packets of cigarette, and to be honest I don't even enjoy smoking at all.

Most of the time I smoke is when I feel depressed, I find myself funny and ridiculous because smoking helps nothing but making it worse, after smoking I'm not only still depress but I'm not worrying that I may get lung cancer or shorter my lifespan because of that few puffs.

I also feel sorry to my parents because they spent so many years to raise me but I decide to harm this body they've given to me, and I do not want to make them sad because of smoking, so I'll quit smoking today.",33,0

Happy Friday!!
Just want to share my case :)

I started smoking when I was a teenager, went to a pack a day until I was 22. Then switched to vaping. It‚Äôs crazy how much easier it became to breathe! I started running, and actually finished my first marathon while I was a heavy vaper. I am now 30.

But with vaping, I lost complete track of my nicotine intake.. I realized it when I switched to Juul, about a year ago.. Two freaking pods a day!!! I became a ¬´¬†secret vaper¬†¬ª, constantly hiding it in my sleeve and using it everywhere. I had made an attempt to quit vaping before using Juul, lasted a few weeks but then I did a hookah and the nicotine addiction came right back..

So this time, I want to get free of the nicotine trap for good!! Today, I have been nicotine free for a week, and I feel great :) I have used Allen Carr‚Äôs book, ¬´¬†the easy way to stop smoking¬†¬ª. Very very helpful!!

Good luck you all, it‚Äôs only a couple funky days with some cravings but there is no physical pain, it‚Äôs all in the brain! 

Remember: Nicotine doesn‚Äôt bring you anything, it only relieves the withdrawal pangs from your previous intake. It‚Äôs all a big fat illusion well maintained by tobacco corporations, it‚Äôs about time to watch them fall and stop making profit on people‚Äôs lifes",62,0
