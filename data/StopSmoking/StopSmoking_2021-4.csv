It's never the right time and I know it never will be. It's just that everything is always so stressful and I'm so busy with college, student jobs, my dog, family and friends so cigarette often replaces a meal. It kind of all started that way in mid-teens when I began developing eating disorder which started by reducing my food intake and replacing it with cigarettes. I am now close to normal weight and a lot better mentally (it's a long path), but I'm so scared of the weight gain and all that hell again. What do you do to replace the habit and time you usually spent smoking? Also chewing gums aren't the best option because they make me bloated. I would love to read that book you all recommend, and I'm looking forward to it. This time I decided and promised myself I will quit once for all. Any advice is welcome!

**And are you interested in using support materials to help you quit smoking?**

We have been conducting studies to develop materials to help people who do not smoke every day with quitting smoking. We are now comparing three different approaches to test what support materials work best. We are looking for nondaily smokers, who want to quit smoking, and who want to use support materials to help them through quitting smoking. Our study is a randomized trial, that is, study participants will be assigned at random to different groups, where each group receives different smoking cessation support materials. If you are 18 years or older, have an iPhone or Android smartphone, and have smoked at least 5 packs over your lifetime, you may be eligible to participate in this research study conducted by faculty at the MGH-Harvard Center for Addiction Medicine. 

Study participation would entail making an attempt to quit smoking while using the assigned support materials to quit smoking over the course of seven weeks, and completing surveys online. There are no in-person study visits.

We will compensate you for your time (up to $150).

3)I worry about my performance at work and how I feel during the first week of quitting (I assume that it becomes easier after first week). I know that my performance will be better than now later but I cant stand that first week with low performance and negative feelings.

The thing for me that really clicked, is that I needed to not only see myself as a non smoker, but as a healthy person. I read Atomic Habits by James Clear and it just made so much sense.

And so I ask myself: what would a healthy person do? 

So far I started yoga 3 or 4 times a week (yoga with adriene, try it, really!), take 5 mile walks regularly and took up gardening, quit smoking for good (started smoking at 16, so was smoking on and off for over 20 years), just today I started cardio. 

This all took place over about 4 months, and it's called habit stacking.

Its not perfect, I'm not perfect, I'm trying to eat more plant based, I already was a vegetarian, but I really love cheese.. and chocolate..

What helps me stay motivated, is listening to motivational audiobooks like the subtle art of not giving a f*ck or books by Wayne Dyer, or even Miracle Morning (bit much, that one) inspirational ones too, like the Choice by Edith Eger, Mans search for meaning, or really informative ones like Range by David Epstein or The China Study.

My first quit attempt was just under a year ago. I prepared by reading Allen Carr, but was an absolute emotional wreck, crying hysterically and feeling suicidal at times. After about 10 days I felt pretty normal again, but ruined it all at 3 weeks when I thought I could have ‚Äòjust one‚Äô sat in the garden having drinks with my friends. I was back to smoking full time within a week.

Fast forward to now, I decided to quit because I‚Äôve been increasingly worried about issues with my teeth. I haven‚Äôt got much on this week so took advantage of the opportunity. My last cig was Sunday afternoon. I purchased my first gym membership and have been every day so far. On Monday morning, when I was on the treadmill, I felt real appreciation for the fact I could run without the usual ‚Äòmy lungs are about to explode‚Äô feeling.

I had one super strong craving on Monday evening, followed by an extreme emotional reaction to an issue that would be nonetheless upsetting normally. Since then however (about 36h), I‚Äôve felt almost completely normal apart from mild physical symptoms (sore gums, light headache) and very manageable cravings 3-5 times a day. I‚Äôm about to finish day 3 and cannot believe how easy it is. I hope it stays like this!

During my first attempt, I think what made it harder is that I slipped up having one cig on about day 3 and day 7. This would have kept me in nicotine withdrawal
longer than I had to be. Also, I think deep down, I was hoping I could be a ‚Äòcasual smoker‚Äô further along the line and didn‚Äôt truly believe I had had my last cigarette. After the way I ruined my last quit, I now know and have made peace with the fact that I can never smoke again.

Don't tell anyone that you've quit smoking for as long as you can. When you do, they say ""congrats!"" or give you a high five which activated the reward center of your brain. You think ""Mission Accomplished! I'm doing great, might as well have one, nothing can stop this momentum.""

After a long quitting process I am finally free and don't even feel the urge anymore.  
I tried patches, I tried cold turkey, I tried vapes nothing worked and I always came back. 

The difference is that every time i came back, I was getting better at quitting.   
So here's how it worked out.   
Week 1, I quit for a day. then smoked the next day then quit for 2 days then smoked freely the rest of the week.  
Week 2, same deal. 

Week 3, time to actually quit. 

1st I promised myself never to actually touch cigarettes again. If I wanted to smoke, I am only allowed cigars (I ll explain how that works later on)   
Loaded up on sunflower seeds, carrots and most importantly, fresh lemons.   
I would squeeze the lemon into a cup with water and every time I had the urge to smoke I took a sip.   
The urge would immediately subside.   


I allowed myself 2 cigars. 1 for getting through the first week. 1 for getting through the first month.   
I had more planned but didn't really want them anymore cause what nicotine was doing to my brain and general mood was very very clear.   


It doesn't help you through hard times. It doesn't reward you when things are good. It hijacks everything you feel in a very disgusting way. Or at least that's what it did to me.  


That's it.   
Now I don't even need the cigars and I am feeling much better. :)  


Hope it helps.

I used to mix it (tobacco) in my joints and also rolled it on its own. I decided to keep with my joints since they're an older addiction and thus harder and more delicate to quit.

In this meantime, I started seeing a psychiatrist for a number of reasons, and she prescribed me anti-anxiety meds (long term). I decided to not smoke weed along the medication, and boy I do not regret that. It was hard, I had cravings, but: there were some unpleasant side effects to the medication and had I been high I'd definitely lose it from paranoia. The doctor said it's unfortunately normal to have those effects.

So this morning I woke up, had a cup of coffee with my mom and I got the worst craving ever. Like, the. worst. one. And I caved in, because imo I was just wanting to smoke **something**, anything, and I chose not to smoke something that would get me high, just a regular hand rolled tobacco. 

It tastes awful. I smoked it all, out of habit I guess, but it was def not good! So that's something. It's easier to not give in when you don't actually enjoy the thing you're giving in to.

I switched from smoking to vaping to quit altogether eventually. Four years later and the vape was my best friend. I realized my time and life were being ruled by this thing. **Wake up, vape. After brushing teeth, vape. After any meal, vape. Get out of the shower, vape. Driving in the car, vape. On the phone, vape. Working from home, extreme vape party.**  So I decided to stop. It wasn't planned, just very spur of the moment as my realization came to fruition.

The first three days consisted of various cravings, but I sustained from divulging. I'm glad I decided to quit on a Friday. I have spent the entire weekend in bed as I've felt the urge to sleep consistently. The only time I have gotten up was to eat or use the restroom. 

**Has anyone else experienced this when quitting?** I feel as though I'm getting some of the best sleep I've ever had. And lots of it as well. 

I fight the hand-to-mouth cravings with drinks. I'm drinking water or flavored seltzer water. I'll also do jumping jacks or some small exercise if the cravings continue to pivot my thoughts. The only snacks I'm having are pretzels, white cheddar popcorn, or carrots/cucumbers with hummus to avoid common weight gain. 

The sharp pain in my upper chest has subsided. The feeling as though my lungs were irritated or almost ""heavy"" when breathing is fading. In reality, I can see a significant improvement in just 4 days which I was skeptical about. I suppose each body/experience is different.

This feels very weird, I‚Äôve never shared my experience anywhere but this seems a nice place to get some support.

8 months ago I quit cold turkey - smoking was making my anxiety worse. Slipped once out of curiosity (wanted to know if something had changed, I know it sounds stupid), and that cigarette felt like the first one: very weird, didn‚Äôt like it at all. I said to myself ""well, now it seems possible to never smoke again for the rest of my life!"".

After that, I never craved one for months... until a week or so ago. I started hanging out with a close friend again (a smoker), on top of that I wasn‚Äôt feeling very good emotionally and well, I think you know where it goes. I bought a pack and smoked the last one today.

I obviously don't blame it on anyone but myself, ultimately the decision was mine, but I can't help feeling so guilty. Part of me knows that I quit once, so I can do it again. The other knows this time is gonna be much harder; 8 months ago I was disgusted by cigarettes so much it wasn't difficult quitting. On top of that, my next therapy session is in 2 days - I need to talk about something important - and the only thing my brain is capable of telling me is ""smoking is the only way to fix your mood!!!"", which isn't true at all.

There's obviously more to the story but I don't wanna make it longer.

I am desperate to quit but what smoking gives me now is some small moments every day that are **just for me.** They also help me cope with highly stressful moments - which seem to be most of the time these days.

I know it sounds silly and this may even come off like an ad, but for me, reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking was an absolute game changer. 

Honestly, who would this reading a book could really help all that much? I didn't. I was very skeptical at first but it was recommended to me, so I looked at a whole lot of reviews and they all claimed this book was what it claimed to be. As a matter of fact I was skeptical for a large portion of reading it. 

I can tell you right now it is so much easier than you can imagine. The way the author changes your perspective on quitting is incredible. You no longer feel like you are missing out on something or you are giving up anything. The feeling is one of freedom and delight. I feel like I've finally escaped from something that's been weighing me down and controlling every aspect of my life for ten years. I don't have any interest in smoking ever again, I truly don't want to! And while that might not always be the case, I'm keeping this book around so I can remember why I feel like that now. 

I spent like $5 getting this book and maybe 5 hours in total reading it. Please give it a try.

The reeeeaaally unpleasant bits for most of us. I was around 2 years clean before I relapsed. I started again about 4 months ago, life's been a trip and a half lately and I ended up smoking again. 

Unlike last time, I don't have to contend with any other nicotine delivery methods like vaping and dipping habits, just nicotine from combustible material. I quit around age 21 the first time after dipping, smoking, and vaping since senior year of high school. I crumpled up the Swishers I bought yesterday (that's almost exclusively what I smoked, I'd snap them in half for times sake and have 4 short cigarillos, I'd go through 2-4 halves in a day). I just told myself I'm not doing this shit again and poof, tossed them into the trash can at the park. I decided right there I didn't want to smoke anymore. 

I feel like a beast lately. It's high time I bloom into a better future with my GF, tobacco is not a part of that future. I'm sick and tired of where I am in life. Last time I went through this, no one close to me knew I smoked and the only people I told that I was quitting were the gas station attendants who typically were. Same situation today, I've been going through the trouble of hiding my smoking habit from my gf.  She has no idea that I've been smoking the past 4 months, I'm happy to quit that smoking and lying shit.

I feel great today. I can feel ape brain trying to yank at my shirt and get me to smoke, but I have been forward and adamant inside my inner dialog about ""nope, I quit smoking yesterday. You straight up decided to quit right then and that's the fucking story I want to be able to truthfully tell in the future"". I'm also getting around cravings by keeping myself busy with work and chores. I've decided to have a bias towards action instead of deliberating and dicking around in most aspects of life now

My biggest hurdle I think will be maintaining that streak, as in not giving back in after months or years down the line like I did recently when stressful times hit. I know in my head I try to make excuses to light up and feel a hardcore nicotine buzz then stop forever, but I can't return to that because I will just fall right back in.

I remember how gidy I was when I first noticed my cravings intensity gradually decreasing when I first quit, thinking ""that's it?

My benefits are:

It's been one month now since I've had a cigarette and it feels good. Over 6 long years I've been trying to quit, some more successful than others with the longest stretch of not smoking being a full two months (this was 5 years ago). I am 25 years old and have now reached the point that I have a well established goal that has been helping me quit, perusing a career as a firefighter, but also, have developed the will power, and built annoyance at myself after failing and trying numerous times to move on from smoking.

Occasionally I will have a few pulls from my friends vapes that seem to put me at ease and have been helping me slowly seperate myself from the addiction. This is something that I've been doing maybe once every two weeks on the weekend, having a total of 5-10 pulls of a vape.

Anyways, I've been finding it really hard to concentrate lately and my stress tolerance has seemed to plummet  this time around (this attempt of quitting). I have been using less vape as a substitute on this attempt which may be why I am finding it more difficult to cope with things.

To everyone here, do you find yourself in the same situation? Losing interest in things you once loved or even just in the little things? Losing the ability to focus on even the smallest tasks and finding yourself easily distracted? And just completely losing your shit to the smallest inconveniences? I would love you hear the stories from others and learn about the lessons of failures and successes of dealing with these symptoms!

I hope my story can help someone.

There is pandemic outside. I am a university student. I dont have a gf currently. When you live by yourself there is nothing much to do tbh. My biggest pleasure was smoking cigarettes and watching porn. But in the last 7 months my body and my immune system has been so weakened that I almost lost my TOOTH!

I learned that toothache is actually a bacterial infection and It usually occurs when immune system loses its strength.

I had the worst toothache experience that it last 3 days straight. I was in constant pain. My dentist said ""your age is still young and there is a chance that you can save your teeth."" 

Antibiotics, painkillers and 1 week of time has given me. If I couldn't save myself from the pain in 1 week, my tooth was going to get pulled. I worked hard on it. I did some workout to strengthening my immune system. Also I didn't smoke. I didn't want to lose my tooth and I was willing to try anything.

It has been 10 days since I had smoked my last cigarettes. My tooth is nearly fully recovered. And everytime I think about smoking, I remember what it has done to my tooth and I immediately get rid of the idea.

People only value the things when they lost them. If you still have your good health, I advise you to protect it for no matter what. Thanks for reading, hopefully it can help some of people.",10,"{'immun': 4, 'pandemic': 1, 'infect': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41661415}"

\- been really horny all the time

I'm asking about what's happening to receptors in the brain. My layman's understanding is this: Nicotine from a cigarette floods neural receptors. Over time the brain adapts by making those receptors less sensitive, thus the need for more nicotine to produce the same effect. The receptors are part of other neural machinery though, and desensitizing them messes with other brain functions and we start needing nicotine for this machinery to function normally. When we quit, our withdrawal symptoms and cravings come from having this machinery not working as it should. But then why do cravings come and go irregularly? Are there times when my little gray cells need to work hard but the receptors are not sensitive enough for the situation?

Where I'm more specifically curious is the effect of the intermittent high nicotine doses from cigarettes / vapes vs. a constant but low dose from a patch. It seems like the constant low dose starts to get the neural machinery working more smoothly, but may also lock in a certain level of adaptation to the presence of nicotine. This brings be around to my very practical question: is it better to wear my patch 24/7 vs creating ups and downs by taking it off for sleeping and exercise?  (I'll usually sweat it off in the latter situation.) To provide a context, I've found a patch to work very well with cravings, but gum far less so.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55118674}"

I understood a little trick.,"Chain smoker for 8 years. Smoke-free for the last 4 months now. Yes! It was hard. Here's what worked and what didn't, and the trick I learned,

**What didn't:**

1. Self-control: at least tried 10 times with this. never worked. 1 party, 1 low moment, 1 hangout, and boom. I'm back.
2. cold turkey: tried initially. But the body reacted negatively. there comes a point in 3-4 days when I couldn't concentrate on anything.
3. Shaming myself: Printed a poster of disgusting cancer mouth to look at. But it was childish.
4. NRT: Initially worked. But after a month, I either needed the gum or a cigarette. It was expensive so I chose the cigarette.

**What worked:**

1. Support groups: Joined various groups on FB. Met wonderful people who were trying to quit smoking like me. Trust me, sharing experiences and support goes a long way.
2. A psychological program called **Quitsure:** It was a free program recommended by someone in that group. (It's an app. Don't know if they offer it on the web). It was a 6-day program. I was skeptical at first but by 4th day I was confident that I can do it and it worked like magic. I learned that the **trick to quitting smoking is to get rid of the desire** to smoke.
3. Feeling of gratitude: every night, I thank the existence for 1 thing that I am grateful for. Trust me! it helps in building self-confidence.",119,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.53498286}"

I used to smoke about 10-20 ‚Äònatural‚Äô roll ups per day for about 16 years. 

Referred to many posts on here throughout the past 4 months for support/info when I‚Äôve needed it so thought I‚Äôd make a post incase it helps anyone else out there on tough days. 

My ‚Äòmethod‚Äô was I used a dental operation as a reason to quit cold turkey as I couldn‚Äôt smoke for a while anyway. From there I kept it up and used a nicotine inhaler for a couple of weeks minimally as I wanted to just get off nicotine and face the withdrawal asap. Maybe could‚Äôve made things a bit easier on myself in hindsight but figured it‚Äôs going to suck either way. And it did... 

I have to say the first couple months were just hell. I had no idea... I do feel like no info out there really prepared me for that. It has been a constant battle with my mind and body since. I hope this doesn‚Äôt discourage people from attempting to quit and only encourages you to push through the discomfort. 

Anyway, the first 2 months I felt like I was literally loosing my mind. Regular anxiety/panic attacks, feeling of dread/doom, dizziness, breathlessness, muscle tension, feeling disconnected from my body, zero ability to concentrate, incredible tension headaches, coughing up what felt like endless mucus, nightmares and an overall sense of depression/loss/grief/nostalgia  like something is missing. 
I‚Äôd feel claustrophobic and nauseous just sitting still in the house or in a car for first few weeks.

To deal with physical cravings I‚Äôd go for long walks in the day and evening and have regular hot baths/showers and drink lots of fluids. 
I also took cod liver oil to help with depression and magnesium for mood/nerves. Also tried to eat as healthy as possible.

The baths and walks really made the biggest difference for physical cravings I have to say. Also doing something healthy for myself every time I had a craving instead of smoking.

Anyway, I never want to have to go through this again and that is my main motivation now I‚Äôm on the other side of many of these withdrawal symptoms. Depression is still there which is tough but I‚Äôm starting to feel myself again slowly but surely. No longer have regular anxiety attacks or sense of dread/doom which is a huge relief, that went away around the 3 month mark.

One the most unpleasant side effects I still have is insomnia. Not something I‚Äôve ever had a problem with in the past. 

I still get regular hypnogogic jerks/sleep start type things as I‚Äôm falling asleep along with a burst of adrenaline throughout the night so I‚Äôm very lucky if I can get a whole nights sleep. 
Feels like I‚Äôve stopped breathing or my heart has stopped and my body is kicking me awake with bolt of electricity through my nervous system.

I wonder if anyone out there has had this same side effect? How long did it take to go away and is there any way of treating it or dealing with it?

Absolutely hated being a smoker whilst being a parent because for me it's scummy, I always smoked in a small corner in the garden and never let my kids see.

My daughter would ask me where I'm going and I would say ""I'm feeding the squirrels"". She is young enough to believe that I was this squirell family feeder and I'd go out to ""check"" on them at various times.

One day she said to me ""mummy when I'm older I'm going to feed the squirrels out there with you"" and that didn't change my habit but it made me feel bad because I do not ever want any of my children smoking.

I never smoked in public, never smoked whilst pregnant but the stress of parenting seemed to bring me back to that ""relief"". I don't want my kids hugging me and smelling that toxic stuff, smoking made me depressed because I felt that I couldn't be the parent I wanted to be since I smoked.

I gave myself a hard time and I'm glad I did because I could not see myself as a good mother all because I smoked, it worked and it planted a seed which grew into working on quitting every single time and here I am smoke free as you know.

Anyway onto my title, my kid is going to be so happy because I've spent the money on swimming lessons for her, I don't want to spend the money on myself because there's nothing I want nor need, it makes me super happy to use it for the kids and I may continue doing that.

I hope everyone manages to find some peace within their quit as I know it can feel like your life is in turmoil most of the day and night. Appreciate the benefits that are making their way to you with every cancer stick you don't have, your body is healing and that's down to you! Well done.

It feels different not to have my life dicated by the smokers routine, I'm not panicked or rushed to get one in. What a massive difference it is once nicotine is no longer in your body and needed.

Seriously look at the benefits of your quit, even if you feel terrible right now there will be something even if it's small, take it and appreciate it because it's going to get better soon!

I'm no where near out of the woods yet but I'm realising what my chance at a healthy life is going to be.

Fast forward three months and we've been smoking every day telling ourselves that curfew at 6pm is hard enough as it is to have to be worrying about quitting. However the thought of quitting just never really left my mind. I never enjoy cigarettes the way I used to anymore. Whenever I light up all I can think of is how I'm doing it because I'm addicted and I get no pleasure from it, yet I can't stop.

Finally my partner and I decided to stop again. I feel like my biggest temptation, which is seeing him smoke, is gone and that together we can do this once and for all.

It's been two weeks with its two weekends. And it's been really hard to go see friends and drink alcohol without lighting up. It feels a bit harder than in January but I think that's good.

I'm a delivery driver for work and get sensitive about my ratings, checking them constantly and letting it bring my mood down when someone puts a negative rating (I'm doing my best, dammit!). It became an unhealthy psychological addiction and constant bouts of insecurity when I would check, so I made a pact with myself not to look for at least 2 weeks so I could focus on my job and stop caring so much about others' perception of me.

I realized that the 'cravings' I would get for checking my rating were like low-grade nicotine cravings without the physical component. Just like cigs, I just needed to push through them for a few minutes and they would go away, and I'd feel so much better that I was upholding my commitment and bettering myself.

My point is, once you do this, it gives you a power over yourself that you can apply to all sorts of stuff. It really levels up your personal resolve and will continue to serve you long after your quit date.

2021-04-19 04:05:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mtvv15/nicotine_controls_you/,Nicotine controls you.,"Hey /r/stopsmoking, first time posting here. I've been smoke free for three weeks now, and I'd like to share some realisations that have really helped me. 

I was a heavy smoker for the past 5 years. I'd smoke a pack a day, but sometimes I'd have two within less than 30 minutes of each other, even chainsmoked sometimes. My throat always felt gross, my gums were receding and it was freaking me out, and I was broke most of the time because I was buying cigarettes - the price seriously adds up.

A year or two ago I read *Norwegian Wood* by Haruki Murakami. There's a great line in it about how the main character quits smoking because he's 'sick of a substance controlling him'. That always stuck with me because I never thought about smoking like that. Of course, he's a fictional character, and the book doesn't walk you through whatever withdrawals and anxieties he feels about it - and it was the fear of these withdrawals and anxieties that stopped me from quitting right then and there.

I wanted to quit almost as soon as I started smoking. I'd fantasise about telling people I no longer smoked. But still, I would always end up smoking again. I'd ask a friend for a cigarette with no reluctance, or find myself almost floating into a shop to buy a pack when I tried to quit, almost like an out of body experience. I'd smoke the first one, convince myself I enjoyed it, and then have nineteen left that I honestly didn't really even want.

Late last year I moved from my home country, where I could buy cigarettes around the corner from my house, pretty much any time, to small-town Belgium, where shops are closed on Sundays and the convenience stores are mostly cash only and have pretty weird hours.

Because of this, I'd have to go to some pretty stupid lengths for cigarettes, especially on weekends or late at night. I'd spend the better part of an hour going across town just to find somewhere open that was selling cigarettes. And that's when it hit me.

I'm just like the guy in *Norwegian Wood.*

If you're still smoking, really analyse your next cigarette. Think about it mindfully. If you've already quit. Try and remember your last one. Did you really enjoy that? What was your favourite part? The unnatural heat in your mouth? The greasy film forming over your teeth? Forcing yourself to stand outside in the bitter cold? The fact that you have to cut back on stuff you *really* want because cigarettes leave a gaping hole in your budget?

The warnings on cig packets are never gonna scare any smoker as long as they think they're enjoying themselves. Nobody in their 20s or 30s is worrying about impending strokes or heart attacks. Sure, when you get older, these might prove more effective. But the only thing that's really going to get you off smoking is *wanting* it. And how do you want it? You just need to see the habit/addiction for what it really is. A substance controlling you. Convincing you that you're having a good time, or doing something that you enjoy. When it reality, it's upsetting your regular brain chemistry and pulverising your insides. Realising that makes quitting seem like a great idea - and means leaving the smokes behind doesn't feel so bad after all.

My question for this group is given how did everyone get rid of those cigarettes that became ingrained into life and just became a part of how things were done rather than feeding the physical addiction. 

Examples of this I can think of are; when on the grill knowing that something would be ready after a smoke, waiting for the floors to dry have a smoke or two and my personal favourite the waiting in traffic smoke. I could name hundreds of these  and every smoker I know could too I think

To me this type of cigarette is the most insidious of them as you smoke these for no reason but yet form part of your daily habits.

I‚Äôm addicted to it. I admit it. I honestly don‚Äôt feel any motivation to quit. Everyone keeps pestering me to quit smoking.

I smoke about half pack daily. I enjoy tobacco, especially with my morning coffee. During the evenings I savor it. At the bar, I must have it with my beer.

My family, friends, and flam Agnes get on my back to quit. For some reason, them asking me to quit makes me not want to quit, it just makes me want to smoke more. 

Out of respect to them I don‚Äôt consume tobacco near them, except for those that don‚Äôt really care.

When I smoke I feel a nourished sensation. An hour or two later, I need that nourishment again ... and again. I enjoy it. 
There are moments where I‚Äôm in my patio, alone, savoring each drag, embracing each puff. Enjoying the ambiance of my own peace of mind away from work or socializing. Cherishing these moments of ‚Äúme time‚Äù. 

It relaxes me from a stressful job with tight deadlines. It soothes me after eating a hearty meal. It‚Äôs part of my morning coffee ritual. 

I do feel it hit me when I work out or go for a run or get intimate. I used to have really good jive, a strong libido. But I realize need to get back in shape. I know I‚Äôm sabotaging myself by smoking. 

I have a family of former smokers. My father quit cold turkey. My brother quit cold turkey. My sister quit with a patch. Those are my biggest advocates to quit smoking; and annoyingly so. 

My father would say things like: ‚Äúquit smoking, you can‚Äôt afford all that extra insurance!‚Äù My brother would say: ‚ÄúHow you expect to get a girl
if your smoking?‚Äù. My sister would say. ‚ÄúStop buying cigarettes and give me the money instead. Btw I need another $$$ loan for my business plz!‚Äù ...

They know how annoying it is to me when they get on my case about smoking. i love them but it makes me not want to quit. Really. What they are doing is having opposite effect. In fact, thinking about it I just lit one one up and am smoking while writing this.  And that‚Äôs what brought me here to this subreddit. 

I‚Äôm writing this because that‚Äôs what I need to do. To prepare my brain. I know I need to quit. So that‚Äôs it I‚Äôm quitting...

But I did this before. With a lady. I quit for her along time ago. But she ain‚Äôt part of my life anymore.  

I quit for a job, but that was a lie. I just didn‚Äôt smoke at the office. 

I quit for a week before participating for a 5k run. But I lit up in celebration of completing the run.

I tried different patched, but all the patches made me sick, nauseated... or at least I tricked myself into believing it made me feel like throwing up.

I enjoy tobacco but hate the smell of Cigarettes with a burning passion, so I've been regularly buying 2-packs of flavored Cigarillos for $1, maybe once every 2-3 days. Considering the weight of each cigarillo is somewhere between 2-3g(4 to 6g a pack), and a Cigarette from a 20 pack is around .5-1.0g(unfiltered at the high end), 20\*0.5=10g and 20\*1.0=20g a pack. So buying two 2-packs is around the same tobacco content of a pack of filtered shorts *and* I've noticed that the nicotine concentration in the Cigarillos is much lower. It ultimately costs much less(\~$9.00 a pack on national average vs $2) however.

**My method of smoking is the real point of this post:**

I take the Cigarillos and empty their contents into a bag. I store the tobacco in the bag and put it somewhere out of sight. When I want to smoke, I have a water pipe(bong) I always use, and it has a relatively small bowl. It takes me a day or two to smoke the entire content of the bag of tobacco because I'm only taking 1-2 drags at a time, putting it all away, and going about my day. It's very easy to forget about it when I'm at home or out and about because it's far less than convenient.

I recommend anyone struggling to consider switching to a water pipe and see if your old habits fade away, in addition to slowing the rate of consumption. I feel that cessation from any substance comes with the negatives as your body adjusts to not having those chemicals on a routine basis, so simply removing the convenience and exorbitant cost would leave you *still* able to consume it, but in a much more controllable manner.

You can also just use Cigarettes, albeit with a much stronger nicotine effect and that might make it more difficult to ween off of it. It's also far more expensive. If available, you *could* get loose tobacco but at that point you may feel obligated to finish the entire bag of it, whereas with the Cigarillo+Bong method, you find yourself with frequent opportunities to *not* go to the store and buy more.

So, that's how I'm working off of tobacco - I don't necessarily want to *quit* because this is a very comfortable routine I have going and it allows me to properly enjoy the buzz from nicotine - when I used to smoke during/after work it would always take time away from what I needed to do. I really hate having the urge to go consume a substance during work or family gatherings, and now I don't have that(with tobacco at least).

I don't count days anymore. I just live the moment and if I feel withdrawal, I deal with it in that moment. I am not saying everybody should do what I do, everyone's motivation might work differently. To me, counting days feels like scratching a prison wall to track time.

Im a music producer and have been vaping while i work for over 3 years now and was able to quit for around a week. During this week I felt like i could deal with creative block and the struggles of creating a lot better than while i was vaping.

I realized this when i caved and sat down to work with my fresh disposable and got way more triggered and just stressed when i couldn't come up with an idea for a certain section of the song i was working on or things like that.

Ive always thought it makes me more aware and engaged in the process since its a so called ""nootropic"" but it just aint from what im finding and I hope others can see this and try this out and realize it really just does create more stress than anything else. 

Nicotine triggers your fight or flight response and overall just makes stressful situations even worse. The only times it may relieve stress is if youre feeling nicotine withdrawals and that because youre relieving these cravings. By abstaining for a long period of time (3 months for the nicotine receptors in your brain to die off and return to normal levels is the data but with the right mentality i think it could be alot less than this) you wouldn't have these cravings and life would be less stressful overall.

Im sure its different for everyone but these are just my findings as someone who quit for a bit and relapsed. Try it out for yourself and youll realize its just sooo isnt worth it.

I believe him when he says that now. He doesn't rationalize it by saying ""once in a while"" is okay anymore.

Anyways, he wants to go back to smoking cigars.. he had a few in February that he hid from me, but after he admitted that he was addicted to cigarettes, he's now honest about his cigar smoking. he had one this Sunday, but I just can't shake the feeling that it's just another excuse for him to keep his addiction going. He claims it's for the taste, that he doesn't inhale, but I've read about former cigarette smokers who do inhale.. He seems obsessed with smoking to say the least, talking about buying a box and getting a dozen, and if he ""were rich, he'd have his own personal walk-in humidor. He seems to get a literal dopamine high when anyone even mentions smoking, making jokes about it, or what not. He originally wanted to smoke a cigar a week, but I voiced my concerns about that. He said he's not a smoker now, even though he intends on smoking cigars with some consistency, but he said he wasn't a smoker when he was smoking cigarettes too, and he even admitted (this was a few months ago) that he probably said that to stay in denial about his addiction.

So, I guess my question is, should I be concerned that he is just once again in denial about his addiction, and that he is smoking cigars to get his nicotine fix?

My journey with nicotine started a decade ago when I started smoking in uni. It only lasted a couple of years because I've always hated the smell and aftertaste, but I loved the throat hits. So when I discovered vaping, I was hooked. Been vaping with drip mods since then, absolutely love the hits (12mg nic juices).

Now, my wife doesn't know I vape and I know she disapproves of it. So vaping has always been a guilty pleasure I have in my study (while working from home or when the missus is asleep) and I associate all my alone times with vaping.

A bit more context: I can't get nicotine refills locally in Australia, gotta import from NZ and I've just ran out of it so I figured this is probably my best chance to quit. But I'm not absolutely convinced that vaping is bad. 

Yesterday was when my juice refill ran out, milked every last drop from it. Today I'm shaking as I sit at my desk, finding something else to do while working. 

I caved in at lunch time and went out to buy nic gums. 

So my questions, after that long winded background:
1. Do nic gums mean that I can't consider myself nic free? 
2. Has anyone quit after vaping for a long period of time and have seen physical improvements in their bodies? 
3. Is there such thing as a bad time to quit? For example if I know I'm entering a tough stretch at work will the upcoming work stress really jeopardise my quitting? Or to put it this way, is it a lot easier to quit if I know my life will me rosy bright in the next say 3 months?

There are also many people that have managed to stop using Allen Carr's book and I wanted to be one of those people. So this post is by no means trying to inject negativity onto this sub. But my experiences are all that I can post about.

This book has not helped me, and I perhaps wrongly thought that if it didn't help, then nothing would. I was quietly optimistic throughout the book, but towards the end, you are told that if you weren't already certain you were going to stop then something has not gelled and you are then prompted to re-read the book. At this point, I realised that something hadn't clicked with me and from there I lost all confidence in being able to stop. Since finishing the book, I have felt nothing but anger and despair and I feel worse than I ever have about smoking, but at the same time I have no confidence in being able to stop.

If there are other people out there that have been left feeling deflated, lost and confused by this book, have you managed to stop since and if so how?

Proud of myself but have to keep it secret!,"I smoked for roughly seven years, gradually increasing how much until I was smoking about 30 cigarettes a day. I wanted to stop for a long time - I was ashamed, I smelled bad, the cost is astronomical and I could hardly walk uphill - and made five or six failed attempts that lasted no more than a couple of days. 

I know a lot of people prefer to go cold turkey, which I totally understand, but it was nicotine gum that made the difference for me. It made it massively more manageable, actually, and made the first couple weeks significantly easier than I could‚Äôve hoped. 

I was chewing maybe 5 or 6 pieces a day, then pretty quickly cut that down to one or two, and now I don‚Äôt have it at all. I am having slightly stronger cravings without the gum but it‚Äôs so much easier to stay strong now that I‚Äôve proven to myself that I‚Äôm someone who can go a month without smoking! The gum just helped me break the habit - I can get up in the morning and move between tasks without feeling listless just because I don‚Äôt punctuate everything with a cig. 

The thing is I was so ashamed that I hid my smoking from most people in my life (though no doubt they could smell it off me). It means I‚Äôve achieved something I never thought I could - I know it‚Äôs early days but I feel confident - during a time when I‚Äôm experiencing extreme mental health issues separately too. And can‚Äôt tell anyone that I‚Äôm proud of me. So I‚Äôm telling this sub!

I can‚Äôt quite say I‚Äôm feeling the financial benefits yet, because I‚Äôve sort of replaced it with impulsive spending just to fill the void. That‚Äôs the next thing to get under control, but I have a lot more clarity on how I was smoking to self medicate now. And I‚Äôm no longer inhaling tar, so I count that as a win.

I‚Äôm still really worried about it. I‚Äôve gone to my doctor and told him about it and he was a bit dismissive of the news. That made me feel better, since if it seemed serious to him, I feel like he‚Äôd have made a bigger deal of it. I stopped smoking completely for a little over 2 weeks and this cough persists, as does the dark specks in my phlegm. I‚Äôve heard from a bunch of people who had similar symptoms who‚Äôd stopped, that after a week or two, the specks AND cough would get worse as their lungs started clearing out all the resin/tar and started to heal themselves and then would start to get better. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case for me. I just don‚Äôt know and that‚Äôs the scary part to me. I started to notice a little bit less frequency between the dark specks in my phlegm as of the past few days but it‚Äôs still there, and just today I coughed up what is probably the darkest stuff I‚Äôve seen in the phlegm. It was brown and real sticky, it looked just like the resin that builds up in glass pipes. I really hope this is the ‚Äògetting worse‚Äô phase before it starts to get better. I‚Äôm going back to my doctor tomorrow for an annual check up and I‚Äôll be asking him if I should consider a more thorough evaluation, since all he gave me was some cough syrup and pseudoephedrine saying it was probably a respiratory virus. Has anyone else experienced something remotely close to this? Should I be more or less worried than I am?

I work with tobacco cessation.,"**Hello!** I posted this on another reddit. I thought to post here aswell. I hope that is OK! I would like to say that, english is not my first language. So I am sorry in advance for  my grammar and spelling.

Anyways, I work with smoking cessation in a hospital in Europe - well tobacco cessation. I have done so for soon 10 years. I really do love my job since it allows me to help people quit tobacco and it can change peoples life amazingly. I also get to educate and teach others to work with cessation. I have seen many different people struggle with quitting and hope that my thoughts and experience can help someone here. With this post I want to try and contribute, I hope it is OK. If I from my sofa here at home after work can help someone, then I'm happy. I do not want to come of as.. ""this is the truth"" but I wanna try and help by sharing my experiences. 

**Motivation**

I feel that many mix up motivation with being able to quit. I.e most people i meet actually got a pretty good reason and motivation to quit - but just not the right tools to handle the craving, habits or new situations they aren't prepared for. Not being able to handle a craving is in my eyes mostly a sign of not having the right tools and not the lack of motivation.

Everyone quit for different reasons, the most important reason is the one(s) that feels good for you. But I do not think that you need to have a 100% motivation on your quit-day. This is because if you have been a smoker for your entire life - how can you know how it to be smokefree? My point is you need a good-enough-reason to quit, and on the way to being smokefree you can find out more great reasons to reach closer to that 100%. I often meet pepole wanting to quit for health reasons but then stay quit because they can i.e sleep in 30 more minutes or feel much calmer or getting lots of more kisses from the kids.

Another part of motivation is what kind of motivation you have. I am not sure on how to translate this to english, but I'll try. Reasons like scared of illness, not wanting to die, pregnancy, upcomming surgery, doctors orders can be a strong motivation. But it can also creating a feeling of feeling forced to quit and give up something you want to keep doing. So I often speak of motivation where you gain something positive; freedom from the addiction, less anxiety, better sleep, hugs and kisses from loved ones. Hopefully it can create a feeling of ""getting rid"" of tobacco and gaining something positive. So, focus on the positive and not the negative I suppose. If you lost something and see it later you might want it back. If you got rid of something and see it later - you are probably happy it's out of your life.

**Tobacco adddiction.**

I see this as a ""tobacco addiction"" that is separated into the *nicotine addiction* and the *habits*. **First,** ***nicotine.*** I think its important to make a point that the cigarette is made to deliver nicotine extremely efficiently. A smoker got nicotinereceptors up in your brain. I explain these as a nicotine-cup (think coffeecup), now imagine every time you smoke you fill these up. It will remove some angst, boredom, tension or will let you focus on work again or stuff like this. But, also imagine this cup having lots of holes in the bottom. The nicotine pours out from the cup. This will give you withdrawal (im not sure this is the correct word to be honest). You will feel headache, boredoom, be annoyed with people around you, stressed. So you smoke a cigarette (or more) and fill the cup up again. And there's still holes - so this repeats itself. I try and illustrate this up-and-down as going on a rollercoasterride where you constantly need to smoke to even all this out. This feeling of withdrawal will also make a normal feeling of i.e stress enforced - or as i say 1 + 1 = 4. This is the reason smokers tend to be more stressed and have more anxiety etc.

I won't go through what happends after the quit-day in detail.. it's quite well described here. I do would like to say that just because it felt like crap one attempt it does not mean it will the next time. One way to get a better grip of your nicotine addiction is to do a [fagerstrom test](https://cde.drugabuse.gov/instrument/d7c0b0f5-b865-e4de-e040-bb89ad43202b)

**Second,** ***habits***. I would describe the habits in three different parts. The s*ocial part* \- smoking with other people and all that comes with that. *The emotional part* \- pushing away negative or trying to cope with negative feelings with cigarettes. It dosent solve anything (still got that flat tire on your car) but it's a really strong habit and common reason for relapse. The other emotional part is also the act of reward. A cigarette after cleaning the livingroom, after work, Most smokers tend to reward themself regularly. The *last part is all the other situational habits*; where you smoke, where you put your pack, using the phone while you smoke, the hand to the mouth, after food/coffee, waiting for the bus etc.

The combination of theese is what keeps a smoker addicted. To break free I work with breaking and understanding the habbits and treating the withdrawal with medication. It's also the background to the ""how-to-quit"" i wrote in my other post. As a sidenote i usually stick by a patient for 2-4 months - or more when needed.

In my experience people often have a strong will - but not the tools to break or work with the habbits and don't use or find the correct medication.

**How to quit**

I couldn't possible recount all the different roads that leads to being tobacco/smokefree..we are all different, right? With respect that we are different, this is (in short..) what I feel works for many.

* Set a quit-date within 1-2 weeks - take in consideration what you are doing those days (want to stay busy with work or .. well what works for you).
* Take two days and write down your cigarettes; number of cigarettes, the clock/time, rate the strength of craving 1-3 (3 would be the most important, like the morning) and finally the situation and feeling (bored, coffee, on the way to the store - stressed..)
* Now, start changing a few habbits. Don't smoke in the same place, don't put your pack in the same pocket/place, dont use your phone when smoking. Don't focus on the number of cigarettes but more force yourself to break the habbits and make it a bit more troublesome and boring to smoke.
* Prepare a few distractions and make sure they are ready on your quit-day. Carrots, walks, streaming netflix, liquorice, water, sugarefree gum, workouts, hobbies, water with lemon.. imagination is key. Don't be afraid to go to your smoking-spot after the quit-day - if you don't have cigarettes there you cant smoke. It can be relaxing.
* NRT or champix/chantix is the most common medication used here. Both can work great if used correctly. If NRT i would recommend the patch in combination with a oral NRT. A common misstake is to use a weak strength and to few i.e gums. I mostly recommend medication like this for many reasons but mostly because withdrawl is such a big reason for relapse. 
* The evening before the quit-day. Toss the cigarettes. Burn them. Break them. Smoke the last one. Give them to a neighbour. Pour water on them. Bury them.

I never say ""good luck"" but more like ""do your best!"" or ""fight!"" but thats a poor translation from a saying in my language.. my point is that it is up to you, not luck of the draw.

I hope this can help someone. This whole text might be a bit generic..? It will not fit everyone, but hopefully someone. I really like the idea of this subreddit and people helping other trying to quit.

I've almost quit so may times, gone a week here and there without, or cut down to 3 a day after meals. I always get this wierd anxiety about quitting (What do I do with my hands? What do I do when I want my morning coffee or after dinner? What do I do while I'm studying?). Today I woke up and had what feels like the start of a tooth infection, I'm so proud of my teeth. I had braces as a child, they're white and I have no fillings and I've never had an infection. Waking up to that gave me more anxiety than the anxiety of quitting. So I guess that's a plus?

I've not had any significant health issues yet from smoking, so I guess getting mouth issues while I'm still relatively young is a big line that I'm really not willing to cross.

In this post and future daily posts, you will get intimate information on how I am going through the quitting process.

Hello Reddit! 

I have decided that I am going to document my journey to quitting nicotine.

My goal with this is to keep myself on track, and HOPEFULLY to INFORM, motivate, and encourage yinz (I'm from Pittsburgh) to finally have smoked that light cig, that last juul pod, that last chew.

I will be putting a huge emphasis on INFORM, as I believe that it is key to succeeding here, and on the topic of ""stop smoking"", it lacks quite a good bit in. I want to let tell you guys about intimate details of my day (not too intimate!). What activities I filled my day with, when and where (and how often) cravings showed up, how I combated these cravings, and how I plan to better handle cravings in the future.

About me as a smoker, I must admit that I never smoked cigarettes ""addictively"". I have never owned more than 4 packs of cigarettes in my life. However, my love, my evil, my pain, my joy is: The Juul. I started vaping in college and got addicted to that. A few years later, the juul came around and was much more convenient and clean that I made the switch. Ever since then, I've been puffing down on juul pods like they were candy. In a 24 hour period I go through an entire 4 pack of 5% juul pods ($22 where I live). Thats $22/day....Not quite a cheap or mediocre habit. I am definitely in the weeds with this one. I want to destigmatize the differences between a ""juul addiction"" and a ""cigarette addiction"". Both are incredibly similar in that, they both use a smoking apparatus and contain high levels of nicotine. However, they differ in that, The juul you can use anywhere, and the cigarette has a more ""ritualistic"" nature along with a ton of other carcinogens (and other addictive chemicals? If I am incorrect please let me know). Although cigarettes have many more chemicals involved, the heart of the problem is the ""ritual"" or nicotine. So please, if you are a smoker, but not a juuler then please do not discredit this information (May I add this as well - I am very well acquainted with picking through my garbage to find nearly empty juul pods that I have thrown away previously) . We all have the same addiction. Albeit, there are some differences. 

Admittedly, I will be using nicotine patches (24mg) to help me. Many people say they don't work. I partially agree with you. We are fighting more than a nicotine addiction. We are fighting the ritual of the nicotine addiction. I.E. after a long day outside where I am finally sitting on my couch ready to play some video games, I am expecting to be able to have my juul in my hand. Or after a game in Call of Duty I will be expecting that ""after game hit"". That will no longer be happening.  Now, I will no longer need to make sure that I have pods or have the juul on hand. In terms of the chemical addiction, where my nicotine levels are running low, is where the nicotine patches come in. I will not experience withdrawel pangs/symptoms as I am still getting my nicotine. But I do believe, the ""ritual"" or expectation of having my juul on hand is a major hurdle that I need to cross. Yesterday, I did a dry run of what this would be like. I put on the nicotine patch the night before, right before bed. When I awoke, I did miss my juul, I scrounged up a few nearly empty pods and it hit for a bit. However, I went outside and read a book, I went to help my grandma with a few things. Nicotine was still on my mind yes, but I was not feeling like I needed it that very second or I was going to explode. That is where I believe the patches are going to help. The main point of these posts will be to document how successful these methods are for me and if successful, hopefully a method you will be able to use. Will the patches help in the long run? That, we will find out soon enough.

With the nicotine patches, I will be starting at 24mg/patch. I am technically on a plan to go from 24 to 14. Then 14 to 7. However I feel half the battle is breaking that ""ritual"" of smoking. So I will be on 24mg patches until I feel comfortable to move on. The key word is COMFORTABLE. I do not want to stay comfortable, at least until I reach 0mg of nicotine intake. I may find out that after I'm comfortable with 24mg patches, then I can go cold turkey and its not an issue. I also might find out that I need atleast 14mg patches to keep me going. That will be documented and shared with you.

So....without further ado, let the games begin. As I've said, I've got a few more juul pods to get through, and they will definitely be gone in the next few hours. Thus, I will officially count my start day as today. Feel free to join me on this journey. Ask questions, start a discussion, share your day. I plan for these posts to happen daily at the end of my day (EST). 

I hope these posts achieve the goal of bringing me success and hope that they can inform you on the ""quitting"" process and ultimately help you reach the goal of quitting.

It‚Äôs been 4 days since I put out my last butt after reading Alan carrs book. My whole life has changed for the better completely overnight.,"I read the book, and it worked for me. I have had no real urges, I just can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt stop smoking sooner. I was a 2 pack a day smoker for over 20 years. I was ready to quit but didn‚Äôt really want too, you know how it is.. but I did and I‚Äôm so happy and no one can believe it but it‚Äôs true. 

I‚Äôm scared people will tell me who read the book that it wears off or something and I will go back to smoking. I can‚Äôt even imagine ever going back and here‚Äôs why: for the the last 15 years I have led a largely VERY lazy lifestyle. Happy to sit at home and smoke butts and never wanting to do anything. I had not realized my love for smoking held me back. I currently live on a wonderful, beautiful trail system but have never stepped foot on one because I would never smoke around healthy people trying to enjoy the trails but also could not go without a butt for any length of time. Plus I‚Äôm a fat lazy loser. 

Since I quit 4 days ago, I have felt very energized and generally happy. I have hiked/walked/jogged within the trail system with my dog every  morning and late afternoon. Today we did 5 miles in total! Which is a LOT for me. It‚Äôs bled into the way I eat, how I spend my free time and my attitude in general. I feel so much less anxious than I normally am. Work is lighter and more enjoyable as I‚Äôm not watching the clock waiting for a break to go smoke. 

My coworkers immediately noticed a change in me. I started to have more time in the mornings after my hikes to shower, do my hair, put on makeup, choose a nice outfit. While it‚Äôs hard to tell with a mask on, they somehow can tell I‚Äôm smiling. I‚Äôve heard about the pink cloud with addiction, I‚Äôm terrified I will crash. Am I over thinking this?

I smoked weed every day for 2 more years and then I got introduced to the evil that is tobacco. Ever since then, I smoke mokes or moles, chops, poppers, spliff bowls, whatever you want to call them. 

For the past 6 or 7 years now, I smoke these mixtures of weed and tobacco out of my bong. I probably take 30-50 bowls per day. I wake up, hit a few mokes, and start working (it doesn't help that I work from home now and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future). Then when I finish work for the day I moke and watch TV for the rest of the day. 

Even before I got into smoking originally, playing video games and watching TV were my 2 primary habits. I really miss the comfort of my old lifestyle where I just moke all day long and take care of my work and then watch TV shows until bed time. 

I last smoked tobacco on Saturday (5 days ago) and I've really been struggling to get through the days, I haven't really been doing my work, I have this brain fog and lack of concentration, I'm trying to distract myself until one of my friends is available to hang out, and the one day I wasn't able to hang out with friends I was absolutely miserable. 

I'm really really considering just going back to mokes and try telling myself that it'll only be for another few more years and then I'll be able to quit when I ""grow up."" I really should just try to grow up right now, but I'm concerned that I live alone now and I've never been comfortable/happy with being alone except during the years that I moked. Even in the years when I smoked weed before adding tobacco to the mix, I would get depressed and sad if I had to spend the entire day by myself. 

On day 1 of quitting, my motivation was physical health but now that I'm on day 5 I'm arguing with myself about how bad the health risks of smoking are with the comfort/happiness I felt just moking all day. 

Even before smoking for the very first time in my life, I was always a sedentary person who dislikes working out and I've never really found other hobbies that I enjoy. I once quit weed for 6 months but continued to smoke tobacco and I basically became an alcoholic and I still smoked tobacco so I definitely don't want to go down that road again. Like I said, I have no problems with using weed. I'm just afraid that after moking for so long, regular weed just won't do it for me. I've been smoking straight weed since Sunday, but I get high and still have no interest in playing video games or watching TV. I find myself craving the head rush more than anything else and just can't enjoy anything by myself because I just go back to thinking about that feeling. Is that just the nicotine withdrawal and I will go back to enjoying those activities in a week or two? Or have I just ruined myself and built this habit and dependence up so greatly that it's too late to quit? I just can't go back to do the life I lived during those 6 months when I had quit weed and my mindset was either ""go to a friend's house and get drunk or count down the hours until I can go to sleep.""

That was just too miserable and I think I'd rather risk my physical health than be permanently depressed again. 

Has anyone gone through anything similar? I know I might be a bit of an extreme and unusual case but I'm really struggling with the mental aspect of quitting and could really use help in any way, shape, or form.

I quit 3rd of January 2021. Cold Turkey. No NRT. For a 46 year old who has smoked for 30 years and in the last couple of years easily got thru two packs a day, this was quite a challenging undertaking! Looking back now that it's already 3 months, I can't lie, makes me pretty proud!! A lot of my real life friends around me still smoke. I have no problem to be around them when they are smoking. 

In the days before I decided to quit, I built up anger and hatred towards smoking inside me. I nurrished that anger and fired it up. I let it grow and grow until on January 3rd it was the day when I decided to quit with full conviction. The first couple of days were tuff. I had to break the daily/hourly hand-to-mouth routine. The built conviction helped me thru that crucial phase. 

It did not take long - roughly 10 days - when a new feeling took center stage: pride! Pride what I had already achieved. It may have been only a few days. Compared to 30 years of smoking that seems like nothing. It's not! I smoked 40 cigs a day on average, more on weekends. Not smoking for 10 days meant I broke the habit of 500 cigs, thousands of puffs! I was so proud to be able to do that, that I did not want to throw that away by relapsing. Of course I was tempted after a good dinner and/or when drinking. But I constantly reminded myself of what I had already achieved and how awesome that is. I just did not want to throw it away. 

And once I was past the first couple of weeks, I started to feel safe. Less and less were the moments when I thought about smoking at all. Of course there were moments when I felt the urge to smoke. Mainly when I was out with friends drinking and they were smoking. But my strenght to withstand that was enough. Easily enough, coz I was proud to have made it this far. I was not gonna throw that away and have to start from scratch. 

Here we are. 3 months quit. Am I out of the woods? I guess... I don't know. It feels like it. Would I like to smoke a cig? Yes, I do. No need to lie about it. But the conviction that I am doing the right thing for the right reasons is much much stronger than the mere urge to smoke one. I am not fighting to stay quit. It's the new norm. It just is. It's good. I like it. I will continue...

This sub helped me a lot in the first couple of days to keep the motivation up - thanks for all who inspired me to stay strong. What also helped me a lot was the below Discord ""Let's quit nicotine together"". It's for cig smokers and vapers equally. There are like-minded folks there who can give you good reasons why to quit, why to stay quit and if necessary talk you out of it before relapsing. Feel free to join. No cost, no ads, no begging for donations, no obligations! Stay strong all and good luck in your endavour.

2021-04-07 20:15:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mmfnux/the_temptation_of_cigars_and_eventual_relapsing/,The temptation of cigars and eventual relapsing,"(I posted before, but just as an aside, I'm a 35m who quit cigarettes about 3 or 4 years ago). I just had to vent because I'm sure I'm not the only one who goes through this stuff! This is mainly about my brain going through some crazy gymnastics to try to convince myself that I can smoke again.

The past month or so has been by far the busiest month of my life. Basically, it's been crazy non-stop stuff happening for me and my wife, but also incredibly rewarding, which are both pretty big triggers for me and when I used to smoke. I used to smoke to feel relieved after a long day's work, and then as a reward for when long-term goals were met. And of course, when it's busy, that would always be prime time for me when it came to smoking. I technically haven't had a cigarette in maybe 4 years now, but I have been having a really hard time as of late.  

One thing I do admit to indulging in last year was cigars, and I know a lot of people say ""Well it's totally different from cigarettes"", but for me, it's a slippery, slippery slope. What was even harder was that my wife even gave me permission to have cigars last year because even SHE just doesn't see them as being the same thing. But for me, it's really hard. I never find myself wanting a cigar for the flavor. My junkie brain just wants a cigar so my body can have nicotine again. And last year, a cigar per month turned into a cigar per week, and admittedly I did have some Black and Milds and inhaled them, so yes, I do view that as cheating with smoking. Thankfully it never became an every day thing last year, but I THOUGHT about it all the time and it was very hard not to keep doing it.

I've mentioned it before but I think my difficulties stem from not having great reasons from quitting smoking. Like, I feel like I never quit ""for me"" as much as I quit because I had to. And those reasons are still why I don't smoke today- mainly, my relationship with my wife is just harder when I smoke. My breath is worse so I don't want to kiss her without feeling bad, it costs money that we both work hard for, and she'd constantly be waiting for me to finish smoke breaks while we're out. So for those reasons, no, I don't really want to smoke anymore. 

But the idea of a cigar or something is just so appealing, and so far has never worked for me. The idea of getting to do that is intoxicating, but now I know that it just leaves me feeling unfulfilled.

Separating the fantasy from the reality is something I have such a hard time with. I suppose I should just bombard myself with smoking science facts when I feel like I'm fantasizing too much.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46808252}"

to anyone who‚Äôs currently going through the process of quitting, i wanna tell you a few things; it‚Äôs not as abysmal as you think it‚Äôll be. it‚Äôll suck for a couple weeks and then slowly you begin to think of smoking less and less. after a couple months it rarely even crosses your mind. the horrible feelings do not last very long.
i‚Äôve said this a million times and i‚Äôll say it again, but the first couple weeks is, by far, the very hardest part of this journey. if you can make it through the initial ‚Äúshock‚Äù of quitting, the rest is much easier by comparison. i promise you that quitting is the best choice, and i promise that you have *NOTHING* to lose by making that choice. only good things will come from your decision.

It was my first ever real quit attempt in 14 years. I was scared to death of Covid and thought my chances of survival were better without the cigs. I used this sub in the beginning of my quit and it was certainly helpful. 

I made it 3 months without a cigarette! Couldn't even believe it. Thought I was officially a non smoker and BOOM, friend offered me a cig - I accepted, and I was right back on the wagon. 

Fast forward to TODAY. I tested positive for Covid on Monday. Crazy what a difference a year makes -- my fear of covid diminished SO MUCH that my reaction to my positive test was to.... smoke a cigarette. 

I am SO LUCKY I have a pretty symptomless case of Covid (loss of taste and smell). But I couldn't help but think how many people were unlucky, what a detriment I'm doing to my body, and the effects covid combined with smoking could have on my lungs. 

If Covid can't convince me to stop smoking... then what will?! That thought was kind of a wake up call. 

Today is Day 1 of my second attempt to kick smoking for good. The best part about the second time is that it's SO MUCH LESS SCARY. Like I know I'm not gonna die or be completely lost without the cigarettes. I know I won't be missing out on anything. That's the benefit of the second attempt. 

The downfall of the second attempt is that I'm bargaining with myself so much more. ""Well you quit before, so have just one & you'll quit again!""

I know I can never, ever have just one. 

Anyway just wanted to introduce myself and when I get a craving, I'll come over to this sub to let the time pass.",2,{'covid': 7},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38286135}"

I just felt that I need some kind of subtle ""high"" to enjoy life even knowing that the perceived high from nicotine is just pointless.

Enjoying every little detail, listening to music, breathing in the fresh air, watching the nature around me - just existing feels incredibly good now. I've been substituting nicotine with other things \[huge amounts of tea, a few joints, even some kratom (careful with that though, it might be healthy but also very addictive)\] but this last week I've dropped everything, I don't even need the tea to stay productive and energized and the realization that I don't need any substance to enjoy anything is mind-blowing.

2021-04-07 15:19:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mm9on0/an_app_made_me_do_it/,An app made me do it...,"I logged into my stop smoking app this evening and it told me to come here and help three people who are just starting out or thinking about quitting.

It seemed like a good idea so here I am! I‚Äôm by no means the finished article, but I‚Äôm 22 days deep and things are starting to look up.

Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned that have helped me along the way, hopefully they can help you too.

1. JFDI: A regional manager told me this once at work and it stuck. The 1st, 3rd and 4th letters stand for ‚Äòjust, do, it‚Äô.

That‚Äôs my message, don‚Äôt put off your stop smoking date till tomorrow or Monday because that way you‚Äôre just putting it off and off until it goes away.

I did that, I said I‚Äôd stop on New Years, then on my week off from work, then when it wasn‚Äôt so cold, blah, blah.

And I never did it on my new date, eventually at 2.30pm 22 days ago I just said, ‚Äúsod it‚Äù, threw my cigarettes out and bought some NR lozenges and spray.

2. FEEL IT

It can be really hard to deal with your cravings but you can do it with bravery and face it down. The first week was a mind fuck for me, I felt terrible and couldn‚Äôt work out if I was having a craving, having a panic attack of downright going crazy.

Then I decided to just really focus on my craving, as soon as it started I‚Äôd pinpoint the bodily sensations and work out what was going on.

For example, I‚Äôd feel a bit dizzy so I‚Äôd enquire as to what was going on. I‚Äôd discover that my breath had become shallow, as if I was subconsciously trying to take a draw of a cigarette.

This had raised my pulse, reduced the oxygen in my blood and led me to feeling a little bit dizzy and lightheaded. 

Is pop an NR lozenges, spend one to two minutes focusing on my breath and watch with awe as everything returned to normal.

This gave me an enormous sense of control, like I was riding a wave rather than tumbling headfirst through it. Try it, and if you don‚Äôt understand the physiology behind what‚Äôs happening, Google it. Knowledge is power.

3. Tire yourself out

I ballsed up in the second week in a major way, I felt sorry for myself, I slept in, I didn‚Äôt go out and exercise and I ended up lamenting my normal sleeping routine.

In that second week I‚Äôd go to bed at 10pm and sit staring at the ceiling until 3am, then I‚Äôd wake up at midday and do it all over again.

Back to FEELING IT, I researched how smoking cessation can affect sleep and then I decided to do something about it.

That night I went to bed at 3am, I didn‚Äôt piss about in bed staring at the ceiling I just went to bed when I was tired and it took an hour or so, but eventually I fell asleep.

I then woke up at 8am after 45 minutes of alarms set on various devices and I felt like shit, but I stayed awake. I walked the dog, I did a dumbbell workout and I got on with some work.

At 8pm I was tired, at 10pm I was super tired and by 10.15pm I was asleep. I woke up at 8am the next day super refreshed and ready to go, the next day I did the same and the next and the...you get the idea.

So through one day of being tired af, I fixed my sleeping pattern and eliminated the one symptom of cessation that had been driving me bloody crazy.

So that‚Äôs it, those are my tips and I hope they work for you as well as they have worked with me. I‚Äôll be back later on in my cessation journey to share more of the things that I‚Äôll learn as I go on.",44,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43977258}"

First week after that was hard but bearable. Weeks 2 & 3 were actually surprisingly easy. But then, half-through week 4, started the insomnia. I haven't had REM sleep in at least 10 days, I've become hyper sensible to light and sound to a point they really hurt (I'm closing my curtains and running around with earplugs), for the last two days I've had a non-stop low-intensity headache radiating from my left temple and I can barely touch the left side of my head without recoiling in pain. I'm losing weight at a frightening pace and I'm starting to look like a corpse... Is this still just withdrawal, or is there something else going on? Should I seek medical attention?

EDIT: So yeah I went to see a doctor. And as was suggested below, it seems like my caffeine intake after I quit smoking was a major factor. I should have roughly halved my coffee consumption (turns out nicotine acts as a caffeine inhibitor), but instead quadrupled it over a couple of weeks, leading to sleeping difficulties. To compensate for the lack of sleep and remain effective at work I started drinking even more coffee (and also energy drinks after a while). After 10 days basically without any sleep, it all came crashing down (hence my post above). Got prescribed some sleeping pills and stopped drinking coffee (at least for a while). I'm still not completely back to normal, but at least I'm functional again :).",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.725337}"

Let's anthropomorphize cigarettes and name them Nic (isn't that convenient that nicotine abbreviated is also a nice and neutral name). Now, describe a romantic relationship with Nic.
Here's how my ""love"" story would go:
Nic and I were apart more than together but Nic was always at the back of my mind like an evil seduction that often made me feel anxious or tense. Nic was always taking my money and gave me nothing. In fact, worse than nothing because Nic is dirty and demanding and toxic and has a really, really bad BO problem. It's so bad that even our under ten-minute ""hold me, kiss me"" dates was enough to get the stink on my hair, clothes and breath. It built up and stained my teeth and messed with my gums. Nic drained my energy and made me start coughing and in the morning I'd cough up what I call a ""lung oyster"". I let Nic in my house and the stink fumes coated walls and windows with a revolting yellow stink residue.
I had tried to leave Nic many times over the years because I knew the relationship was destroying my health in multiple ways. The cost to support Nic was ever increasing too. I got away a few times but then Nic would come along and beg me saying ""Oh my darling, hold me, kiss me, hook up with me just one more time. Just one more time for memory sake, that's all...It's not like you're letting me get back together with you or anything..."" Alas, before long I'd be right back into my toxic relationship with the abusive Nic.
Well, I'm happy to be 3 weeks Nic-free now. I've learned my lesson to never ever put my lips to Nic again. I don't have the best willpower and can be impulsive. However, I won't fall for Nic again!

Having something to interact with- the little circle, gives me a sense of peace and like I‚Äôve fulfilled the need I thought I had to smoke because I did something instead, I pressed my finger in the circle and breathed in and gave my lungs a good dose of air. 
It also feels congratulatory, a little press of a button that reminds me I don‚Äôt kill myself smoking no more.

I'm past my ten month mark, patiently waiting for the big 365, and keep reading the posts here and giving upvotes to all quitters. I think I'm past the point of no-return, and can safely say that only sheer stupidity can make me go back to smoking. I'm not saying it can't happen because I know mistakes happen and the cost of one mistake might be huge when dealing with smoking. But I'm saying I'm comfortable being a non-smoker for now. I'm honestly over it. It's really mindblowing when you think about it. I'm over it, guys! I'm free for now. This has been my nth quit (stopped counting), and the furthest I've ever gone has been 3 months. I started when I was 18 and am now over forty. I smoked nearly a pack per day when I quit.

I read something here today that made me think. It was someone in the ""active phase"" of their quit asking if it will get easier in time, because the only thing the poster could think of was ""I want a smoke"" or something to that effect. That got me thinking about what I could give as a reply, and it really led to me analyzing the problem more deeply. So this post is me rambling about quitting smoking, based on that. These are mostly my own thoughts and opinions on the matter and not some hard facts. I hope they're reasonable enough for some to see as helpful.

&#x200B;

Maybe to jest a little; smoking is not really the root problem when you think about it. Smoking is just an action. If you did not want to quit, and had an infinite supply of cigarettes, where's the problem? You would just, well, smoke and not worry about it. So if you are a smoker, smoking is only an issue (to you personally) when you can't smoke. If you are a non-smoker, then smoking is an issue only because of other people.

Jesting aside, I point this out because I think it's beneficial to see clearly that when you are quitting smoking, **you are the one giving yourself this problem**. To make that sentence not seem totally counterproductive here, it's probably best to expand this a bit. First of all, I'm not encouracing anyone to quit quitting. I'm just pointing out some things I think are true. I'm encouraging the honest dissection of their said ""problem"" outside of the normal habitual way of thinking about the issue.

I think I can best illustrate what I'm trying to say by taking the one nagging thought every quitter has and unraveling it some. (and then some)

&#x200B;

""I want to smoke""

That kind of thought usually, and especially for people here, is not an easy one. It causes some anxiety. I propose that it is exactly this **thought** that gives you the ""I don't feel good and I hate it"" - feeling. From all I read, and probably through some personal notes made when quitting myself, there is also a physical side to the issue. I'm not focusing on that. I'll just say that for me it was real, and it's possible to overcome it. That's it - I'm not going further on this post to analyze that part. I'm interested in the psychological side of the issue.

To recollect and pull some loose ends together, I think it's obvious ""I want to smoke"" causes us to feel bad exactly because we are quitting. If we weren't quitting, the though would be a non-issue. It could even give us some pleasure, because we'd know we'd ""get to smoke again"" and smoking would ease the anxiety that thought gives us. **But** I think it's super important to notice that us quitting is not the only reason the thought ""I want to smoke"" causes us to feel bad. And it's really not just the quitters that feel bad, it's also the ""should quitters"", and everybody that can't get that cigarette they want for whatever reason. There are a lot of reasons nowadays.

If ""I want to smoke"" gives you bad feelings, it's because it is really a two part ""problem"" if you will. It's really ""I want to smoke, **but**..."". I see the ""I want to smoke"" as one problem (the ""root"" problem) and whatever comes after the word ""but"" as another problem. The ""but""s are what makes this whole question interesting, and totally worth looking into. Here's an incomprehensive list.

**I want to smoke, but...**

* I don't have cigarettes right now
* I don't have money right now to buy cigarettes
* I should buy something else than cigarettes with this money
* I can't smoke because it's not allowed here
* I should go outside, but it's cold there
* Smoking is not good for my health
* Smoking makes me smell cigarette-y
* I'd set a bad example to my kids
* I don't want to smoke around my non-smoking friends
* I should quit smoking
* I'm currently trying quit

These are all familiar to me. Your ""but""s might vary, but I think there probably are some common themes like money and health issues. If I listed all the possible ""but""s there are, the list would be really long, I suspect. Every one of these ""but""s is going to give me the bad feels.

A point I'd like to suggest is that when you are a smoker, in practice you are always adressing an infinite list of problems that is exactly that list of ""but""s. As opposed to when you are quitting, you are

1. focusing on only one of those ""but""s (the I'm trying to quit), and
2. the ""but"" you are focusing on is actually solving the complete ""root"" problem of ""I want to smoke""

So you are removing all of the problems just by focusing on one of them. The one you ""give yourself"". The problem of quitting. It's a bit of a disguise, of course, because the actual bare bones end result of ""I want to smoke, but I'm currently trying to quit"" is just ""I want to smoke, but I want to not want to smoke"". Sounds a bit spastic but that's the essence, I think.

That sounds great, and super affirming, doesn't it? Dealing with just one problem instead of a host of them, right? This makes quitting super easy! Well, I don't want to be a grouch, but as you are well aware, that's not really all there is to the problem of quitting. There is also the ""I don't want to smoke, but..."" -set of problems. This is of course the most familiar territory for people that are quitting, or thinking about quitting. Some examples could include:

**I don't want to smoke, but...**

* Smoking makes the bad thought ""I want to smoke"" go away until the next cigarette
* Quitting seems too hard
* I'm afraid of failing another quit
* I'm used to smoking
* I don't know what to do with the spare time
* My colleagues see me as a smoker
* Smoking is seen as a positive by my friends
* Everybody around me smokes
* Smokers seem so cool

I still maintain that if you succesfully tackle the ""root problem"" which, again, I think is ""I want to smoke"", you will eradicate the hardest ones of these problems also. This is simply because if you weren't a smoker, it would be hard to find a situation where you'd be faced with the thought ""I don't want to smoke, but..."".

So most of that list should go down also by tackling the ""I want to smoke"" -problem. But not all. You'll simply be rid of the problems that relate to you. The problems that come wholly from outside will still be there. For me that has been a small set of problems, some of which weren't really problems at all in the end. Some of the problems that look like they come from the outside like ""Smokers seem so cool"" are really coming from you. Some are just plain lies, like ""Smoking is seen as a positive by my friends"". It used to be true for me, long ago, but it's completely the opposite now. Of course I don't know anybody else's situation exactly, so you must do your own honest soul-searching regarding your own list.

A maybe useful way to work with all of these problems and to relate them to your quitting efforts are to transform them into concrete perceived pros and cons instead of hard to grasp sentences or ideas. I think it can be agreed upon that the ""I don't want to smoke, but...""-list of ""but""s is basically just a list of ""I want \[this\] and smoking gives it to me"". Translating that list above (for my case):

**Smoking gives me:**

* release of the ""I want to smoke"" - thought
* an easy option
* safety from failure
* comfort
* something to do
* comfort
* acceptance
* i think acceptance?
* a cool smoker persona

Going from there, can I further assume that trying to maintain

**another quit gives me:**

* ""I want to smoke"" - thoughts that can't be released through smoking
* a hard option
* possible failure
* discomfort
* times I don't know what to do
* discomfort
* rejection
* i think rejection?
* no cool smoker persona

Don't panic. You need some mental acrobatics for the next step, and I know they're hard when you're quitting. Quitting is hard. I know I couldn't do mental gym like this when I was in the middle of the quit but for those that can, I think the following is true. So the above lists are seeing it through smoking=positive, quitting=negative. They could also be written out flipping the polarity, or at least reverted to neutrals like this:

**Smoking gives me:**

* An endless chain of ""I want to smoke"" thoughts
* no challenge
* no possibility to win
* comfort with a price
* waste of time
* comfort with a price
* acceptance from smokers
* acceptance from smokers?
* a smoker persona

**Quitting gives me:**

* A possibility to end the ""I want to smoke"" -thoughts
* a challenge
* a possibility to win
* a possibility to end discomfort
* spare time
* a possibility to end discomfort
* acceptance from non-smokers
* acceptance from non-smokers?
* a non-smoker persona

Note that the lists are not exclusive (at least they should not). They should all be still true. An example:

**Smoking gives me:**

* release of the ""I want to smoke"" - thought

and also

* An endless chain of ""I want to smoke"" thoughts

**Quitting gives me:**

* ""I want to smoke"" - thoughts that can't be released through smoking

and

* A possibility to end the ""I want to smoke"" -thoughts

All true. So smoking and quitting they both will have positive and negative sides. If that's shocking, then so be it. It simply is true.

So to make quitting perhaps easier, it can be beneficial to **focus** on the positives of quitting and negatives of smoking. I can already tell you it can get pretty damn hard. That is also one reason of why it's so damn hard to quit smoking. It's easy to weasel out and pit the positives of smoking against the negatives of quitting. For me I can say it was easy because it required no effort. I'd still get bombarded with the set of problems but I chose to deal with them by ignoring them completely. It brought me other problems like feeling dishonest and disappointed in not tackling the problems. I think those problems can be listed under ""Smoking gives me"". And can you really ignore the very problem that you're ignoring your problems? I mean for a while, I guess. But it's still always there. So I never really could ignore the problems smoking had for me, during the time I smoked. Sure I could give in and say things like ""I can't deal with this right now"". And that worked for a while. But those cop-outs piled up, and gave the dishonesty-problem more and more weight.

Focusing on the positives of quitting and negatives of smoking would mean putting against each other:

**Smoking:**

* An endless chain of ""I want to smoke"" thoughts

**Quitting:**

* A possibility to end the ""I want to smoke"" -thoughts

It seems like a no brainer, right? But I know it's not that simple.

At least when quitting, if you think it's ""trickery"", and not honest to focus on positives of quitting and negatives of smoking, because, after all, they both have pros and cons, then at least be consistent, and put the positives of smoking against the positives of quitting. This is most honest and requires no tricking of yourself. This would mean putting against each other :

**Smoking:**

* release of the ""I want to smoke"" - thought

**Quitting:**

* A possibility to end the ""I want to smoke"" -thoughts

So it's a quick fix, or **the** fix. Again, not this simple, I know very well. But this kind of analyzing may help you figure out some hidden issues you might have regarding smoking.

As a sidenote - One of my ""hidden issues"" was a some kind of ""smoker identity"" I had formed as a kind of, I don't know, a ""mask"", maybe? Smoking was convenient somehow. I could hide behind it. I don't know what I was hiding in the end. Maybe I just grew it off somehow. I knew the issue, I had recognized it, but I really did not see any way to ""solve"" it. I think it was enough that I saw it, and recognized it as a legitimate problem. When I then went through the process of quitting, I think somehow, this time, the issue just ... resolved itself. It was very tied to me smoking, and maybe when I quit I somehow dealed with that issue subconsciously as well. I don't see myself as a smoker anymore. I had nothing to ""replace"" my persona with. I just ... don't smoke now. Nothing of me was lost when I quit smoking. Granted, my social circles were tiny even before the corona pandemic, and they're grown ever smaller since. So I had less ""pressure"" of keeping up a facade for others, but anyway I think the persona was more for me than for anyone else.

In essence I think when you realize you need to quit, you are extending a set of problems with another set of problems, in order to solve most of those problems. :D For the ideal ""don't care"" smoker, the set of problems is the ""want"" problems. (I want to smoke but it is not allowed here, etc...). For the ""should quit"" and the ""quitter"" gang the set of problems is both of the ""want"" and ""don't want"" sets. It's a big set.

I think it's within the realm of possibility to ""ride the quit"" by just ignoring everything else and focusing on the ""i want to smoke but i'm trying to quit"" -thought. You know the ""one problem"" you should focus on when quitting. I think that if you do this, you still will have to deal with some of the things in your ""what smoking gives to me""-list. At some point. Somehow. So while my view is that for the core work of the quit, a simple thought like that will be a great workhorse, there must exist a solid foundation of having real reasons to support a quit further than just until the next relapse. But also - everybody should have a workhorse.

Also remember that you are pitting **smoking and quitting** against each other. Not **smoking and not smoking**. If you manage to quit and become a non-smoker, the pros and cons of smoking will hopefully not be an issue anymore. They are not an active issue to me anymore. I'm not saying you should not weigh the pros and cons between smoking and not smoking, if you are a non-smoker. I'm just saying the issue should be pretty much irrelevant by then. This is just me speaking through my experience this time, of course. If you have managed to quit, and still wonder if you should maybe take up smoking again, I say you either

1. simply don't care about the health&money issues smoking presents
2. you have had incredible luck by not getting truly caught up in smoking
3. you have some unworked issues with smoking, like my ""identity problem""
4. have maybe issues with your memory (not remembering how damn hard it is to quit)

&#x200B;

So as I come to the end of my ramble I want to come back to the question that sparked this investigation. These will be my final points, and closing remarks. And they will contain some speculation regarding the way our brain works. Disclaimer:am not brain scientist.

""I want to smoke""

""I don't want to smoke""

It's never that simple. If for nothing else, it's always with the ""but""s.

""I want to smoke""

""I don't want to smoke""

""I want to smoke""

""I don't want to smoke""

It's this nagging, horrible ball of confusion, laced with prickly anxiety. My suggestion is to simplify it. Divide and conquer. Focus on the ""I want to smoke"". That's your enemy. That's the target. That's the root cause of why quitting is so hard. It's because you want to smoke. It is the recurring **thought** ""I want to smoke"". It's that **thought** you want to get rid of. Everything else will fall into place after that thought is gone. And until that thought is gone, you're still really quitting smoking. And to bring some reassurance - it really did vanish for me. I'm not everybody so I can't say if it's universally true that it will go away for everybody. I hope it does.

Don't be angry at yourself for having that thought. That's pointless. If it helps, just point your anger at the thought itself. :D It should make the discomfort somewhat easier to bear realizing that you're choosing not to smoke because you want to get rid of those god damn *make-me-smoke-even-though-i-dont-even-want-to-smoke* thoughts. You're starving them to death. Also you can't control your thoughts. So that's a horrible realization for a quitter, right? But it's also a relief, sort of. It's not you bringing that ""I want to smoke"" -thought into your mind. The thought comes and goes as it wills. It's your job to bear it when it makes its presence. That's a bit of a downer. But the upper(?) is that the thought gets it's power through the act of smoking and every time you deny that, the thought loses. Everytime the thought loses it grows weaker. It might have some sudden attacks where it feels it's completely overbearing, but this is also temporary. It gets weaker. It is a fact.

For me it is totally gone now. The thought ""I want to smoke"" does not cross my mind anymore. I don't look at people smoking and think they are priviliged. I don't pity them either. I don't judge them. I know what that is like. I remember that. I know I would've flipped if someone would have had the audacity to lecture me about smoking. So I'm not lecturing. I'm giving my two cents for people like you who are considering quitting, or are in the process of quitting. I look at people smoking and kind of just think nothing of it. It does not concern me anymore. It is irrelevant. And that is such a victory in it's own that it's enough to make a grown man cry.

&#x200B;

P.S.

To come completely clean - the above is not something I thought of during my quit. I don't even know if it's useful during a quit. I mean I hope it is, but I don't know if it would've helped me during my quit. I consider myself a non-smoker now. I'm not completely sure why I managed to quit this time. It had something to do with

1. the whole corona situation
2. me remembering having made a ""promise"" sorts of that I'd quit the day they stop selling menthols, and that they did stop selling those
3. using the smoke free app (as I've done on quits before)
4. having read the easyway by Allen Carr, though I only read it once some time ago and while it worked for that specific quit, I still relapsed after some months
5. keeping this sub in my list of ordered subs in my reddit app, so even though I was still smoking, I kept seeing posts from this sub
6. accepting that quitting will suck for some time
7. accepting that there's a chance the nagging thoughts won't ever go away
8. accepting that smoking really, probably, i think, has become more socially unacceptable than acceptable round my parts
9. realizing there's money in this game
10. having an internal framework of ""you are not your thoughts"", through some vague excursions in meditation and buddhism in general
11. having an idea that the hardest part is to start, and the rest just will follow

...

and ... it's an endless list really. Some maybe experience on the matter, some pure luck. If I'd be as bleak as I possibly could, I'd just say smoking was through with me for the time being (subject and object in that order). I have respect for the fact that smoking is a f\*#king soul-sucking beast. I respect that  f\*#king soul-sucking beast insofar that I will not toy with it, and hope to never cross paths with it again.

I can't give guaranteed-to-work, life-included advice on quitting that would work for everybody and every situation. I wish I did. I'd probably make millions just having that skill. But I can give my two cents and I hope you find it helpful in your ""quitting"" or ""should quit"" situations.

TL;DR

Hard to put down simply without it being comically obvious, or overly cryptic but -

&#x200B;

You want to smoke for several reasons. A legion.

You don't want to smoke for many reasons too. Tons of reasons.

You quitting is that you ""Want to not want to smoke, while also wanting to smoke"" :D

&#x200B;

Why you really want to quit is because you want to get rid of the set of problems smoking gives you.

The problems can be simplified into ""i want to smoke because"" and ""i don't want to smoke because"" -problems.

These can further be simplified into pros and cons of smoking and quitting.

I think honestly analyzing the problems related to smoking, especially if you have a hard time quitting, is a good thing to do. Even if you don't seem to arrive into any apparent solutions. It's just maybe to see the situation more clearly.

&#x200B;

I propose the main problem really is the recurring thought ""I want to smoke"", and that by simplifying the quitting effort as an effort to get rid of that thought specifically, you release some of the load the host of problems you face is placing on you. So kind of like concentrating your fire against the enemy command centre, instead of fighting all the small parts of the enemy horde.

Might work for some. No guarantees.

I   Have 2 mL refillable tank. I use a 50mg salt nic juice. I am probably   vaping every 10 minutes 2 or 3-8 puffs. I maybe go through 1/2- 1.5   tank a day. Addiction has gotten considerably worse the last year   because of working from home during quarantine- i have been vaping for 5  years and was a cigarette smoker for 5 yrs before that. I think I'm  getting some  gum issues and tachycardia. This is a rough estimate, i  could be vaping  more.

1. Roughly  how many packs of  cigarettes is this as far as nicotine ( I Know this  is a hard question to answer )? Please don't judge me, I want to quit. I  feel plagued right now. I used to only smoke a pack of  cigarettes a  day.
2. Did  you quit cold turkey? How long were the withdrawal effects? I am  reading Allen Carrs easy way to quit smoking and it really seems like I  should just cold turkey it. I'm very considered I am going to get  seriously ill. I don't know how much nicotine I'm consuming, but I think  it's bad. What were your side effects if cold turkey so I can know what  I am getting myself into.
3. Did  you throw your vape away?  I have tried to quit vaping several times in  the past with nicotine gum and cinammon sticks, threw all my shit away,  and then when I fell back into it... cost me so much money to rebuy  everything. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I Have no money and am  not confident right now. My partner could probably hide it somewhere.
4. Should  I try nicotine gum for a few days so I don't explode? Even chewing 4mg  gum throughout the day I'm sure will be a dramatic decrease in nicotine.  Again, any illumination on how bad this is I would appreciated

Some of these days have been easy, some have been hard, many have been somewhere between. The main thing I've learned so far is that, for me, quitting smoking is war on two fronts.

The first enemy is the science of addiction. That perfect combination of the anxious craving and the sweet release of a nicotine hit.

Until I decided to quit, I'd never thought about how smoking actually works. I knew it was addictive. I knew it was bad for me. I knew it would increase my risk of cancer, of heart disease and of having a stroke.

I knew it would likely kill me.

But, to be honest, I had no idea of the chaos nicotine creates in the chemistry of our brains. I didn't know it was messing so much with neurotransmitters and their receptors. That it was dominating dopamine and ambushing acetylcholine.

I've learned a lot about that in the last thirty days.

I didn't sleep much in the first few days. The insomnia was a  familiar foe from previous failed attempts to quit. Even when I did get some sleep I would wake up feeling awful.

I quite often still do.

The fatigue, brain fog and lack of motivation have been the hardest things for me so far. Smoking cigarettes used to be so instrumental to the structure of my days.

I'd wake up and smoke a cigarette to help me feel alive. After breakfast I'd have a coffee and a cigarette while mentally planning my day. I'd use cigarettes to reward myself for ticking tasks off to-do lists. If something was stressful I'd smoke to settle myself. If something needed thinking through I'd smoke as it ""helps me focus.""

Each of these nicotine hits gave me a simple, small high throughout my day. Each period of time between would assemble anxiety that smoking could assuage. There's a satisfying momentum and structure to these peaks and troughs.

When you take the highs and lows away it can leave you feeling flat.

This flatness is terrifying. You wonder if you needed smoking to feel something. If you'll ever not feel tired. If you ever will feel motivated and productive. If you'll 'enjoy life'.

This is where I realised that it's a war on two fronts.

It's not only a battle against science.

It's also a battle against history.

Quitting smoking can feel like losing an old friend and having to say goodbye. A funeral isn't complete without a eulogy and a chance to reminisce on the good times.

There are so many stories I can tell myself about smoking. Of all the cigarettes that have helped me enjoy good times or endure difficult ones.

For me, the nostalgia can be as addictive as the nicotine.

But the problem with nostalgia is that it's very rarely the truth. We rewrite our memories and yearn to return to a final draft that is more fiction than fact.

I reminisce about how smoking helped me deal with a stressful work project. It didn't. Smoking gave me a brief escape to deal with a tedious nicotine craving. Then I went back to my desk and still had to face up the stressful situation.

I look back on great conversations in smoking areas after watching favourite bands. I tell myself it made the experience better. But did it? Or was I anxious and desperate to get outside for a smoke during the encore? Did smoking actually spoil my enjoyment of that experience?

It's so easy to feel that the warm glow of a cigarette enhances our experiences in life. But it's not true. It does not gild them with gold.

It stains them brown.

Quitting smoking is not a funeral.

It hasn't earned a eulogy.

It requires a reappraisal.

Without the false satisfaction of smoking I need to re-learn what I actually enjoy. I need to stub the cigarettes out of nostalgic memories I hold onto.

As my body fights back against the science of smoking, I'm facing up to the history. It's only been thirty days and there's a long way to go, but I'm no longer in mourning.

Smoking has never done anything good for me.

And it hasn't for you either.",53,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60882276}"

I managed to quit smoking after years failed attempts in 2018. Every time I quit, really hard anxieties hit me which were super unreasonable and gone the moment I gave in to the cravings. Around the 3rd month was always pure hell emotonally where most attempts ended.  This all took around 6-12 month to be really free from cravings which always came with emotional issues.

Last year when first lockdown hit us, I did something stupid. I started smoking every Friday when I was drinking at home again. Usually a full pack each Friday, sometimes even Saturday. I thought, casual smoking wasnt that bad and I never craved them during the week, but after a while I realised that I was really moody around 3  days after the friday where I smoked.

I stopped that habbit again 2 month ago and last weekend when I was drinking I was hit by a crave to smoke followed by a hardcore anxiety attack like I only knew from my old smoke attempts.

I have bronchial asthma, mild but it's always there. I started smoking around 4 years back, 6 a day or more, depending on whether I was alone or with smoker friends. Asthma and smoking is a bad combination, tborughout the years, I'd smoke intensively for a week and had to slow down because of the amount of phlegm my throat was creating. I had decided then that I'll smoke for 10-15 more years and then leave it with the help of medical substances and lung purification(I have no idea about these things, just assumptions) but since the last week I've been feeling like my body is speaking to me, I can barely walk a mile without wheezing so I guess it's time for me to take the step.
I tried regulating my smoking and reducing it gradually but I just can't moderate my habits, it's either all in or nothing for me I guess.
Today is day 1 and I've decided to do it cold turkey. I've gotten rid of all ashtrays but I'm also a regular cannabis user, I use a bubbler but I have no intentions of stopping my cannabis intake. How will it affect my leaving process? Is it better if I take a tolerance break from cannabis or will it just make the withdrawal harder? Also I smoke by mixing tobbaco with my weed. Should I stop doing that as well if I want to quit?

Any tips for me? I'm really scared of the withdrawals but I read here that it's the worst only during the first week. I also read in this group about a hand drawn tree where each leaf signifies a day without smoking. I'll do that as well.

Explanatory models support a potential role for neurotransmitter systems, inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotrophins and neurogenesis, and epigenetic effects, in anxiety pathogenesis. 

All of these pathways are affected by exposure to cigarette smoke components, including nicotine and free radicals. This review critically examines and summarizes the literature exploring the role of these systems in increased anxiety and how exposure to cigarette smoke may contribute to this pathology at a biological level. Further, this review explores the effects of cigarette smoke on normal neurodevelopment and anxiety control, suggesting how exposure in early life (prenatal, infancy, and adolescence) may predispose to higher anxiety in later life.

A large heterogenous literature was reviewed that detailed the association between cigarette smoking and anxiety symptoms and disorders with structural brain changes, inflammation, and cell-mediated immune markers, markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter systems, neurotrophins and neurogenesis. Some preliminary data were found for potential epigenetic effects. The literature provides some support for a potential interaction between cigarette smoking, anxiety symptoms and disorders, and the above pathways; however, limitations exist particularly in delineating causative effects. The literature also provides insight into potential effects of cigarette smoke, in particular nicotine, on neurodevelopment. The potential treatment implications of these findings are discussed in regards to future therapeutic targets for anxiety. 

The aforementioned pathways may help mediate increased anxiety seen in people who smoke. Further research into the specific actions of nicotine and other cigarette components on these pathways, and how these pathways interact, may provide insights that lead to new treatment for anxiety and a greater understanding of anxiety pathogenesis.

2021-04-01 05:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mhrjp7/day_75_update/,Day 75 Update,"I quit 75 days ago. I started off with the will that I didn‚Äôt want to smoke because I had just bought an appartment and we were planning to start a family. But around the 10 Day mark I started getting anxious, angry and irritated at everything. Around Day 14 I started having anxiety and panic attacks and I didn‚Äôt know what was causing it. I had only had a full blown panic attack once before in my life. Then around Day 14-21 I had health anxiety and was anxious about everything (chest tightness, sharp pains in the ribs, restlessness, inability to sleep, high blood pressure etc.) I then spoke to my doctor who asked me to speak to a psychiatrist. By that time I had figured out that the only difference in the last 3 weeks was I had stopped smoking. So I started looking into nicotine withdrawal symptoms and could relate to it completely. 

The Psychiatrist recommended I speak to a Psychologist who would help me through Behavioral Therapeutics. He also acknowledged that it could be the nicotine withdrawal that is causing these issues. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to a Psychologist, I felt if I started NRT I could overcome the withdrawal symptoms. So around Day 22 I started nicotine gums (4-7) pieces a day, I also started physical exercise every day for 40 minutes. 

Around Day 30 I was physically fine but mentally really weak, nervous, anxious, scared, loss of confidence. Then I started reading into spirituality and inner peace and joy. I must say that the book on Inner Engineering by Sadhguru, really opened my eyes. I started having confidence again, I exercised more, I started doing the mind meditation exercises every day that he recommended. By Day 35-Day 50 I consumed less than 2-3 nicotine gums per day.

From Day 35-Day 70, i religiously exercised, started doing exercises which I thought my body wasn‚Äôt capable of doing. I meditated daily for 30 minutes. I improved my nutrition by eating raw salads and fruits. That improved my digestion and I was happy and pleasant every day. Strangely when I smoked I was always constipated and need cigarettes and coffee everyday to do my business. But its been 75 days now, my digestion is superb and I have little to no effort in doing my daily business. If anyone is interested, sex has gotten better because my physical stamina has improved and so is my confidence.

Around Day 70 I had realised that consuming nicotine is not the solution. Nicotine is just a stimulant and each time I consume it, it is only going to worsen my withdrawal symptoms every time I stop. So at Day 70 I stopped the nicotine gum, i was only consuming 1-2 a day but still my body got tensed up for the next few days, irritability and anxiety was back but not so high as Day 10-20.

At Day 72 I read into the benefits of CBD oil and how its supposed to help bring calmness and ease anxiety issues. So I bought some CBD Oil (1000mg CBD/10 ml bottle, 3mg CBD per Drop) I took 4 drops yesterday( the normal way under the tongue) and within 20 minutes I felt so calm and cool. All the issues that caused me stress and worry, I didn‚Äôt care at all. My confidence was back! I was not that irritated or anxious anymore. Today is just the second day and I am consuming 3 drops in the morning and 2 in the evening. It feels really promising to me, and I can‚Äôt wait to post my 100 Day update. Hopefully it makes me forget about this terrible habbit of smoking and gives me the confidence to live my life carefree.

So to summarize, the withdrawal symptoms get better each week, I exercise daily and religiously ( High intensity training helps improve breathing), do mind meditation 30 mins daily, eat good food(raw salads and fruit, less processed meat), quit coffee, take 5 drops of CBD oil a day and things look that they will get better and I can put a lid to this horrible phase in my life.

I used to smoke a pack a day and came down to 2-3 cigs a day in 2021. 2 days back I cut it out completely and replaced it with Stop-Nic Nicotene Gums (2mg). I have been chewing 2-3 gums a day. I just hope I dont relapse, this is the first time I am properly quitting. The target is to get to 1 month mark for now and phase out the gums too. 

Are nic gums okay to use to get off cigs? Any other tips and recs to help me quit healthily? Anything is welcome tbh, I am tired of being a slave to this habit of smoking.

TIA!",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45342255}"
