I rarely had caries and never had a single issue with my gums. I went into the dentist this week to get my wisdom teeth removed and my dentist commented about how my gum health was not as it used to be. I knew smoking was terrible on your mouth and health, but I never knew how fast it could take over. Thankfully my wisdom teeth removal is forcing me to not smoke, and I know this time it will stick. The idea of losing my teeth, getting oral cancer, or the countless oral health issues associated with smoking is nauseating. Threw out my pack and have never felt more confident about this time sticking. Take care of your teeth friends, they don‚Äôt grow back!",11

2021-01-30 18:11:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/l8ye1h/5_years_this_month/,5 years this month,"I thought I would post my success story on this anniversary. After about 15 years of smoking, I stopped in January 2016. My father passed away shortly before that. He was an athlete in his day and never had a major medical issue his entire life. Then 50 years of smoking caught up to him. He did quit late in life, but there was nothing stopping the decades of unfiltered Chesterfields and cigars. 

After all of that, I knew I needed to make myself better. I‚Äôm someone that could never smoke when I had a cold, and 5 years ago I got a bad cold that lasted about 2 weeks. Normally I would go back to cigarettes the moment my chest felt better, but I decided to stick to it. Then 2 weeks became 3 weeks, 4 weeks, etc. I would often think about how much longer my father would have lived without it, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave my family behind someday. That motivated me to keep pressing on.

As for what I did to help cravings, I used the lowest dosage of the gum. The low dose worked for me because it gave me just enough to ease the burden, but did not keep me addicted. In addition, the timing was right because there were very few people in my life that smoked by then. Most of my friends and family had quit, so I was not missing out socially. In fact, it had become a lonely experience.

I still keep gum on hand just in case when I am drinking. Because one time I regressed and bummed three off someone and spent the night throwing up. That just about did it for me.

My advice is, find what works for you!  Everyone is different. Good luck to you all.",31

I feel really stupid to ever start smoking because I was always against it and told my parents to quit.

Then smoked a few cigarettes when I was with friends at the bar and kinda liked it. What harm could a few cigarettes do when drinking something, right? Until it gradually becomes more, you start smoking at home and now I'm at around 20 cigarettes per day. You all know the story.

So lately I've been coughing a lot for about a month or so. I know ofcourse that smoking makes you cough but I just didn't expect to already have so much problems with it because it seems I'm coughing more than my parents do even though they smoke their whole life pretty much. 

Anyways, long story short I just need to stop smoking. Cold turkey or gradually, what do you advice ?",3

Currently at the end of the 6th day of my quit and I‚Äôm not gonna lie there are a ton of ups and downs, but given it‚Äôs my first week mostly downs haha.

I finished reading Allen Carr‚Äôs easy way and I didn‚Äôt even want to quit that badly but after I read it, i was inspired to at least try.  It hasn‚Äôt been easy but I was thinking about the concepts in the book wanted to share my thoughts.  

Cigarettes are an illusion of control.  We can control when we need something to feel better or something to help us escape.  Almost like controlled pain.  Yes it creates anxiety when we don‚Äôt have them but it also takes that anxiety away, making us feel like we have control over our anxiety, even though it‚Äôs only actually curing the anxiety created by nicotine withdrawal.  It makes us feel like we‚Äôre in control, especially when we have trouble coping with life.  But it‚Äôs only an illusion, we‚Äôre not in control, we only control when we do and don‚Äôt have nicotine, which makes us feel like we control our anxiety.  There‚Äôs no real benefit other then the illusion on control.  It‚Äôs kind of like giving your little brother the controller that‚Äôs not connected.  We trick ourselves into thinking we can control how we feel with a cigarette, a guaranteed boost, but a boost from the shitty feeling of nicotine withdrawal, rather from our true sources of anxiety.  


Hope that wasn‚Äôt too repetitive but I would love to get anyone‚Äôs thoughts on this :)

I tried to quit hundreds of times. 

I'm now using a quit method I devised which is inspired by literature I read on psychopathy and how true psychopaths tend to use drugs but not get addicted. 

My thought process is that psychopaths have a detachment between their logical thinking and their emotions which regular people don't have. They also have a documented history of not exhibiting withdrawal symptoms or behaviour when thrown in jail and suddenly deprived of substances (usually meth and crack) even when they were using heavily beforehand.

I decided to try to emulate this detachment as closely as possible. Since I am not a psychopath, I wondered if there would be any quick way to create a similar detachment in my own mind. Then it dawned on me that the times in my life where I'd experienced the biggest disconnect between my thoughts and feelings were times where I felt completely hopeless and like I had no self worth and had given up on caring about what happened to me because I had no control and life was just pain.

That's the exact opposite of how I felt during my hundreds of past failed quit attempts.

I kept trying to psych myself up for my quit. The health benefits, willpower, motivational speaker type ""yes we can"" jargon, think about the money saved and so on.

No matter how motivated I got or how much willpower I saved up it was always completely ineffective.

My withdrawal would always mess with my psyche and totally derail any momentum I built up.

And then when I started feeling bad and the momentum wore off I would light up a cigarette.

So, I tried something different one single time and now I've been quit for 18 days and counting.

I decided to do everything I could to make myself feel down. I basically decided to give up on ever being happy, to stop trying to feel good. I decided to proactively make myself feel bad. I decided to stop caring about whether or not I live or die.

So I'm basically manually forcing myself to be depressed, numb, miserable and empty. I'm making myself feel completely, absolutely and totally hopeless.

Every time I get excited I tell myself there's no point to being excited. Life is pointless and I'm worthless garbage and don't deserve to be happy.

Every time I start to feel happy I remind myself that I'm never going to be happy because it's a futile and impossible effort.

Everything I'm getting done I'm just doing because, well, there isn't anything else to do.

I'm deliberately depriving myself of hope and joy completely.

And it's actually working!

I think the negative messages are making my body produce endorphins that are helping out with the psychological withdrawal.

I also think that having absolutely no hope about my quit attempt and no care whatsoever about my own self is allowing me to detach and not care about what my own self is going through.

I used to get really bad anxiety when I quit. 
When my anxiety starts acting up I'm basically telling myself that there's nothing to be anxious about because nothing matters and I'm just made of biodegradable flesh and no one loves me.

I just seek out thoughts that make me feel completely hopeless and worthless and find that numb hopeless feeling where I'm empty and sad and I let it completely flood through my whole body until all that exists is emptiness.

Every time I start feeling I remind myself that there is no point to feeling anything because I'm so mentally disordered that my feelings are working against my own survival, which is the ultimate motivation to stay numb and hopeless.

I just keep thinking about how badly I've been treated in this life, how worthless I am and that I deserve it and it will never get better.

I know this sounds totally wrong but surprisingly I don't care what anyone thinks right now.

It's like I found this strange numb euphoria that is making the withdrawal easy.

I'm still getting the mood swings and the cravings but when you feel completely worthless and you feel like you've completely given up and there is no point to anything...you just don't care about the withdrawal because you don't care about your own self because there's nothing here worth caring about.

I am not worth caring about.

As messed up as that sounds it's actually a relief for me because it's easing my normal anxiety. Apparently when I feel like I myself am not worth caring about the anxiety actually shuts itself up because there is nothing to worry about if there is no self to protect.

I extended that thinking toward other people as well. We're all just annoying flesh and bone bags that move around and make noise. We're all just part of the joke called life where you're born, suffer and die.

If I take away any value that I attribute to anything then everything becomes meaningless and I get to stay numb.

The funny thing is that even writing up this bitch is going against my progress so I'm having to write it in small chunks at a time because trying to share something that worked for me in the hopes it helps others kind of goes against the whole mentality I'm maintaining to stay quit.

I think I'm going to stay this way until 2022 if not longer because the helpless empty feeling of surrender to my own suffering and completely giving up on caring about myself is a million times better than what was going on in my brain before.

And it's definitely helping me quit. After hundreds of failed quit attempts I've now been quit for 18 days.

I think I might give some updates in the future but not for a while. I just felt like sharing today.",1

2021-01-26 06:35:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/l5c98k/my_personal_six_tools_for_quitting/,My personal six tools for quitting,"Just finished a Zoom call with my therapist. I managed to come up with six tools to help me quit smoking. I will be really happy if any of you would find them useful. 

1) Rubber band
This is a psychological one. Put a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you get an impulse to smoke, just pull and release it. This will cause a small pain. The more impulses you get, the greater the pain will become (but don't be too harsh on yourself, you don't want to start bleeding). The idea is to cause a more basic impulse-reaction response and also to replace the vertical movement when you put a cigarette in your mouth with a vertical one, when you pull and release the band. 

2) Eat an apple
This one is a psychological one as well. Once you get an impulse for a smoke, go to the usual place where you do it (in front of the office, on your balcony, etc.) and eat an apple instead. First, it is much healthier. Second, the idea is to make a ritual out of it. Smoking is a ritual - open the pack of cigarettes, get one out, close the pack, get a lighter, put the cigarette into your mouth, light it up. Do the same with apples - go to the place where you usually smoke, take an apple, peel the apple, cut it, eat it. Replace one ritual with another one. Of course, feel free to replace the apples with any other food you enjoy. 

3) Post it
Write down a few questions on those colourful sticky notes. Like ""What do I earn if I do not smoke a cigarette now?"", ""What will I do with the money I save from not smoking?"", etc. Stick the notes to places, where you spend most of your time - your desk, your bed, your balcony. With time the notes will become a part of your surroundings and you will notice them less. So, make sure you replace the colours and questions every one or two weeks. 

4) Think about it
Spend a few minutes thinking about smoking. Ask yourself questions. Why do you want to smoke? If you have ever quit it for a few weeks or months in the past, how did you do it? What makes you want to smoke? Does your body really need nicotine? Or is it just the habit? Think of this as meditation where you get deeper insight on the topic.

5) Visualize yourself
Imagine you have managed to successfully quit smoking. Take a look at you from a distance. A few months have past. You feel much better, you have started noticing great improvements in your physical and mental well-being. You replaced smoking with healthy eating or exercising. Or maybe you acquired a new hobby. Just visualize the person you will be when you quit. 

6) Be part of a group
Contact people who smoke. Ask them questions. Propose you start quitting together. If you know anyone who managed to quit successfully, ask for tips. Join online communities (like this one). It is always better when you are a part of a group rather than doing it just by yourself. 

From here on you have two directions of actions. First, you could start practising those while you smoke. With time, gradually, you will try to replace more and more cigarettes with one or more of those tools. The second path is to set up a date when you would like to quit and then immediately implement those tools. I guess it is up to you which method you will choose. 

I hope somebody finds those helpful. I wish good luck to everybody! We are in this together!",28

So basically I haven't had any nicotine since new years eve, I quit smoking a while a go but couldn't get off the nicotine gum/patches, but basically went cold turkey for the New Year. I started smoking when I was 14 and I'm 21 now. 

I'm feeling less irritable now, and can think clearer. However, I still find that I'm lacking energy and mental clarity, and feel like my head still isn't right without nicotine. It is particularly bad in the morning. Does anyone know how long this might last? It's like a semi-permanent brain fog.

I have been an alcoholic for around 6 years and smoking for 10. I kept telling everyone I would quit eventually but secretly had no desire to. I didn‚Äôt care, my addiction was all I have a fuck about. When I found out my girlfriend was pregnant it was the scariest moment of my life cause I knew that my life wasn‚Äôt my own anymore, it was about my daughter. Both my parents were alcoholics and my mom smoked, and it put me through such pain all through my life. Was I gonna put my daughter through that? I didn‚Äôt want to. I wish I could say I stopped the moment I found out about the pregnancy but instead I hit the bottle harder and smoked more and more. I was killing bottles of whisky and smoking 2 packs a day. All the while my poor girlfriend was pregnant and dealing with an addict like myself. I was killing myself and didn‚Äôt know how to stop. I would get worried that I couldn‚Äôt stop and would be the same parent to my child as my parents were to me, straight addicts. But that stress made me hit my vices harder. It got to the point where I was contemplating the unthinkable because I figured she may have been better off without me. 

But then one night I woke up hungover and it was already 10 PM the next day after I killed a bottle and 2 packs of smokes feeling like shit. I was about to get up and go smoke my first cigarette of the day and thought to myself ‚Äúhuh, if I just wait 2 hours I would have went an entire day without smoking‚Äù and decided to go for it. Once midnight hit, I got a feeling of accomplishment and pride of having some control over my addiction and thought to myself ‚Äúthis could be a one off or day one‚Äù and decided to finally try to be the man that my daughter deserves.

That was January 25 2020. I made it a year. And I‚Äôm a happy, sober father to a beautiful 10 month old baby girl. I just wanted to say that just browsing this community really helped keep me going, and wanted to thank all of you. I also want to say that if you‚Äôre reading this struggling with the quit or thinking about it. You got this. It gets easier, and it is so fucking worth it.

I did go 7 months before only to relapse during covid - which is as dumb as you can get but the boredom and stagnation chewed on me.

This time feels way different.  For one thing I don‚Äôt know my quit date, just that it was sometime in May 2020. I didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it or get the app that counts days this time - I just stopped being a smoker.  I can finally play hockey at my best capacity (for my age lol) and I don‚Äôt stink of smoke or have a lighter wallet.

I smoked for almost 15 years, with a pack a day habit the last 6 years.  I can‚Äôt believe I did it, both smoke that long or quit.  This sub helped a lot, seeing people who literally smoked for decades up and quit really makes you see there is no reason not to stop. 

At this point I may get a craving once in a while and it will last 3-5 seconds at most, in fact, the only big craving I can remember is right now as I talk about it and share this story, I‚Äôll probably sign off after this.

You‚Äôre not a smoker and neither am I. We can‚Äôt obsess over it, we don‚Äôt smoke.",6

&#x200B;

My partner is 40 years old and has been smoking since he was 17. We've been together for4 years and also live together.

Perhaps it's not my place to get him to stop smoking but I don't think he truly realises the impact of smoking on his health. He at least acknowledges that smoking is bad for him and wish he never started smoking. He says he needs to keep smoking for improving his mental health, however I believe there are better ways to help. He is religious so I think part of the reason he's not bothered is that he thinks it's God's decision if anything bad happens to him. I believe it's my responsibility as his partner to reduce his smoking and improve his health.

He is mildly willing to try some methods to either reduce or stop smoking, but they're all half-hearted attempts.

He says he is reducing smoking by putting less tobacco in the tobacco paper, but the amount of cigarettes is still around 12 a day and has been for a long time. He says 12 cigarettes a day is a small amount to smoke.

I try my best not to be too imposing, but I care about his health. I only talk about his smoking habits once a month so it's not too persistent. So far I've tried using the following tactics:

1. Nicotine gum - he only tried once, the problem he has is that they're irritating to the throat and cause a burning sensation.
2. Nicotine patches - only tried once, they cause a burn on his skin and left a red mark.
3. Switched to vaping - I've brought three different brands but with each one he says that it's not the same and doesn't like it.
4. Provided materials about the health effects of smoking - not sure if he has ever read it thoroughly. However, I've also had many discussions about why smoking is bad for your health.
5. Suggested to tally each time he smoked a cigarette on a calendar - I was thinking that perhaps having a visual record of the amount he smoked each day could be useful in tracking progress of reduction. He did this for a month (I'm glad), but stopped and also didn't reduce the smoking amount. Although I'm sure he would continue doing it if I kept reminding him
6. Suggested to use a rationing approach - starting with 12 cigarettes a day and smoking one less cigarette a day each week. I suggested that I could control the flow and provide him the cigarettes in the morning which would be the ration for the day. I've tried convincing him to start this tactic for many months (actually more than a year). Eventually he somewhat agreed to it, but very reluctantly, but only if he does it himself. I won't go in to specifics but it was abandoned on the second day, and I tried to convince him to keep going and we had an argument that I was being too controlling. He's right and I think I should have used more positive reinforcement instead.
7. Suggested a timed approach - have a minimum amount of time before you can smoke the next cigarette and try to increase it over time. He's not willing to do this since he says he needs to smoke when he feels like it for his mental health.
8. Tried to convince him to meditate with me daily - he's unable to meditate longer than a few minutes.

I have never smoked a cigarette in my life so I can't relate to the feeling - I guess it would feel like giving up food for a couple of days and then someone wafting a pizza in your face.

Does anyone, as a smoker, have any advice on what I could do? 

I really think it's mostly finding the motivation to do it rather than doing it.

Has there been any material that you have seen in the past that have helped convince you to reduce/stop smoking?

Has there been any tactics you have used that have helped reducing smoking?",3

Hi everyone- I have to confess something. I have been secretly smoking and hiding it from my family for over a week.

I have been smoking for 12 years, over a pack a day. I‚Äôve made several attempts to quit. Then about two weeks ago I tried again using nicotine patches. They actually really helped but I couldn‚Äôt sleep when I had them on. So I started taking the patch off a few hours before bedtime. At around 2 am that night I had an intense craving and went and bought a pack. I smoked one cigarette and threw it out. I thought ‚Äúok I‚Äôm good, it‚Äôs just one‚Äù. 

Since then though, every time I go out to the store or something I smoke one or two and then throw the pack out. I didn‚Äôt want to admit to my boyfriend and dad that I started smoking again, so I‚Äôve been hiding it. I come up with reasons to leave the house, smoke a couple cigarettes and come back home. I have scented lotion, gum and mouthwash with me so I don‚Äôt smell when I get home. 

The worst part of all of this is that I used to smoke over a pack a day, and now I only smoke about 5 or 6 a day, but I feel more like an addict than I did before. I‚Äôm lying and sneaking around and I hate it.",4

Been trying to kick tobacco out of my life. I stroked my addiction slowly by adding it to my joints to create spliffs. Before you know it I'm adding more tobacco than weed and craving more of that stimulated feeling from tobacco than the relaxation I desire from weed. 

I'm thinking I might relapse again, it's just such a hard time right now to give up smoking. In the middle of quarantine, living with my parents and going to school. I will admit that the cold weather (I live in the midwwest) is part of the reason I'm stopping right now. I can smoke a bowl in the house but I won't subjegate my parents to second hand tobacco smoke. They don't have a problem with marijuana but all of us are aware that tobacco i.e. cigarettes has contributed to take some of our family members early through cancers and deterriating health.

I know that cigarettes are terrible for you. However I just love adding a little bit to my joints. has anyone else been able to control their addiction with marijuana and eventually just kick the both of them. 

I use marijuana medicinally, so I'm thinking of just switching to only edibles to get rid of the oral fixation I must have. I also have a counselor that I meet with bi-weekly which has been a great resource. I think those sessions and a combination of the cold weather has pushed me to stop. I have also messed around with quite a bit of mushrooms this year and they have pushed me quit as well. 

I just can't stop thinking about cigarettes. It's like on my mind every ten minutes. It's disgusting I hate thinking about it so much and trying to reason with myself that I can roll another spliff and not immediately start thinking about the next. Has anyone dabbled with spliffs and weened themselves of somehow. I'm also very distracted and this isn't good becuase I work in the mornings and I go to school at night from home. Thanks for reading and letting me rant. Peace and Love and Patience.",8

Started taking champix as directed and holy smokes, I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it. 

PROS:
- I have wicked, vivid dreams (some rated R, some with super powers)
- when taken as directed I have zero cravings and when vaping does pop into my head I get slightly ill (kind of a pro because it makes me hate vaping)
- 2 pills a day that block the nicotine receptors in your body. Same results from nicotine therapy, without the nicotine
- $54CA for the full treatment (3 months, $18CA a month. 
- if you do end up caving, and take ‚Äújust one hit‚Äù you feel absolutely nothing positive from it. So avoid it.

CONS:
- with vivid dreams come nightmares and weird anxiety dreams, but I found they were rare. I‚Äôve had maybe 3 of them
- if you don‚Äôt eat before you take them, prepare for a tummy ache 
- I‚Äôm not very good with pills

2021-01-25 08:26:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/l4nt6k/my_feelings_and_my_advice/,My feelings and my advice,"Today's my 23rd day without a smoke. Can't even believe that it's real, as in a way it feels (at least now) so easy. I smoked for approx. 12 years, a package/day. And now i just decided to quit, cold turkey. I believe this is my 3rd or 4th (serious) attempt, but this time i'm feeling real confident. And i just wanted to share my thoughts here, both to boost further my confidence and also help others with hopefully at least one thought that will stick if you're reading this :)

First here's a bit of a harsh reality.. The first 2/3 days can really be a pain in the behind to manage as it really is about physical craving, but once you get through this, congrats, its all just a mind game and keeping cool from there on becomes much more simple. The only thing that u have to do: NOT SMOKE. It's that simple. And with every day that passes, you're one step closer to a huge victory. For me, the cravings went somehow like this:
- first 2/3 days... Very unpleasant phyical cravings, coping with a few nicotine chewing gums if really strong
- 4-10 days... Manageable middle-strong cravings
- 11+ days.. Eventual cravings that would pass rather fast
- 20.. For me this is where it finally started getting real easy. And now that i'm here... I'm not going back.

I really wish to encourage and help at least one person out there do the same, so i wish to share all the help/tips/motivation/advice that really helped me get to here:

- chewing gums and toothpicks are a wonder.. Dont worry if you look ""stupid"", just do whatever it takes to help yourself and eventually this will go away too

- i made myself ""milestone badges"", printed on paper (1 day, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15...) that i keep on a very visible place on my desk, and cut out on every achievement - the point is to be able to hold it and really ""feel the achievement"" + give u further motivation for the next milestone, if you're at least a little competitive :)

- engrave the ""NOT ONE MORE PUFF"" in your head. In combination with ""THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS ONE CIGARETTE"", repeat these two sentences to yourself every once in a while till they become a little whisper in the back od your head...

- drink lots of WATER !!

- someone posted this here a while back, and it has been a wonder mantra for me: ""There are only two types of pain. The pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Only the pain of discipline weighs ounces while the pain of regret weighs tons."" Really think hard about this. It so true and simple, and yet so powerful

- going for walks and taking really big deep breaths while walking... Amazing

- socializing... THE BIG TRIGGER... i can imagine that everybody experiences that in a different way.. But from my previous attempts, what has worked for me is this: avoid seeing people as much as you can in the beginning (~first 7-10 days), but then go back to normal without any socializing restriction or avoiding smokers. Just watch them smoke and feel sorry for them (and even more importantly happy for yourself)

- and here are the benefits i can already note, after just 3 weeks... Whiter teeths, more energy, waking up more easily and without diziness, s*x is soo much better, breathing is more stable, easy and deep, much less anxiety, not smelling... Just an amazing feeling. 

Also ABOUT ANXIETY.. I tended to think that my smoking was the solution to it. Well believe me when i say that it's the total opposite: SMOKING IS THE CAUSE for anxiety... Dont fool yourself anymore, nicotine is really a bi*ch and tricks you into thinking it helps you when it's actually destroying you. And i want to tell you that THIS IS NOT JUST ""A MEDICAL THEORY"", but something that you can already feel after just a couple of weeks without a smoke. 

There's even more that i could say, but for now i'm gonna stop here. I'm just gonna promess myself and everybody here that i won't smoke again, and tell you all that you are able to do the same. It's worth it.",20

What am I missing?,"Today it has been 3 weeks since I smoked my last cigarette. And I have been a rather heavy smoker with close to 2 packs a day. January 3rd when my lung hurt and I felt like having trouble to breathe, I told myself: That's it! I won't further poison my body with this shit!!! Basta!!! ... and I quit... cold turkey. 

I still have cigarettes readily at home in a drawer. I am still around people that smoke. I haven't changed much in life. I am determined - in short that's the whole secret.

If your partner, parents, doctor or who ever tell you it would be good if you quit. That's not gonna cut it. You need to find the conviction inside of you! You alone! For yourself! Find it by talking to yourself, openly, brutally honest. Or write it down. But don't hide anything, don't pretend, speak it out - loudly, clearly, no sugar-coating. You can give yourself a zillion of objective reasons to quit - no need to repeat them here. We all know them. You need to change the feeling inside of you by finding the conviction that smoking is hateful! Feel the awful smell, the dirt, the black stuff you're coughing up, the stinky fingers, the yellow teeth, the ash in the car, curtains, walls, furniture... I started to get so sick of all that shit!!! That was the main driver to find my conviction that quitting is the one and only thing that helps getting rid of all that. It worked; and still works!

If you get to that point, quitting is easy. You just do what you want: NOT SMOKING!!! Every minute without cigarette is not sth that you need to be strong for but you welcome it. Every minute gets you further away from the horrible past. If it works for me, it can work for you! Convince yourself!",120

I have a sugar and shopping addiction.

I am here because if 7% of smokers can permanently quit nicotine, as addictive as it is,
Whatever worked for you, to conquer a nicotine addiction, will surely work for me.





I used to think, as a young man when I was 18-24,  I was above reproach because I didn't drink or smoke.  Those were the vices that were preached against back in high school  It's easy for me simply because I never think of them, there's no draw for me, and when I drink I feel bad not good.  
So I am unable to get on any soapbox about alcohol and willpower: not drinking costs me zero willpower, because it already had a negative feedback for me!  I didn't see that at the time (age 18-24), I misread my body's innate aversion to alcohol, as an expression of personal willpower.  It was not.  I was also therefore blind to my own actual addictions, thinking myself both not an addictive type and also not seeing my behaviors with food and consumerism as problematic for many years.

Shopping and sugar, not alcohol and tobacco.
Those are the things that make me feel good, and therefore dangerous for me.
I don't know if cigarettes would make me feel good and I'm not going to find out.

and I say they are problems for me because it has affected my quality of life, as I weigh 245# and have $82,000 in total debts, and used to have a hoarding problem from the shopping compounded by my own lack of organization skills.

I'm addicted to caffeine too but it isn't affecting my quality of life, so why change my coffee habit?  That's the key.  Sugar and shopping are becoming damaging and limiting a fulfilling life, so I need to change.  


Unlike smoking (since the 90s anyway), shopping and fast food are still woven into the cultural fabric of American past times, so it took me much too long to recognize them as the problems they are for me.  
They're not so unconditionally vilified.
I actually supported the NYC soda size limit and so much more, junk food needs to be treated in 2020 as a public health crisis like cigarettes were from 1971.  I can only imagine how hard it would be to quit smoking in the year 1950, surrounded by it.  If food advertising and the farm fill were regulated and overhauled respectively it would go a long way to combating obesity.

But anyway, that's not what I'm here to talk about.

I want to correct my behavior now while I'm not in too deep and have time to reverse the damage, to my health and my finances.

I'm tired of motivational speeches and exhortations to have willpower thay repeatedly, I never act on.  I need fundamental understanding of addiction mechanisms and I need a system to fall back on when I lose willpower.

From James Clear:
""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems...Adapted from one of my favorite sayings by the Greek poet Archilochus: 'We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.'""


Nicotine is known as one of the most addictive substances in existence.  Just like sugar and obesity, the costs are only paid incrementally and the ultimate cost (early grave) is only paid decades after you start, so there is less urgency to correct than with more dramatically devastating drugs like meth. 

There are so many purpose-specific books.  Diet books.  Budgeting books.  Quit-smoking books.  They all share 'addiction' and habit at their core, only the subject and some specifics change.  
I'm asking here what books really cut through the 'popular science' noise and ACTUALLY explain addictive behaviors and how to change any damaging habit.  I want to understand my own behavior and permanently change it.  I don't want motivational speeches, I want a system.

How did you quit smoking?
How can I therefore quit shopping and eating [to excess] for pleasure?",1

However, I'm still very absent-minded and cannot focus on anything.

On the other hand, I don't want cigarettes per se, I just want to feel normal again.",10

1. Is it true that i will get flu like symptoms? This is a very important question for me, COVID-19 is really striking hard my country, in fact is one of the main reasons why i want to quit smoking. The thing with this is that currently i live with my mom and she's very afraid of the virus. Im not an essential worker and everyone in my home follows quarantine rules very strictly. But if the quitters flu is very common i need to know how to treat it and to tell my mom how long i will have symptoms before she starts worrying that i have caught covid (my quit day is very soon and the last time i went to the store was 10 days ago).
2. Im very close to moving to another state. Do you think that abandoning all my other routines will benefit me from not wanting to smoke again?
3. is it true that withdrawal symptoms peak at day 3? i have read a lot about quitting and most people say that the intense cravings will be the third day after quitting and that something happens around 2 weeks after quitting when nicotine is already leaving my body and that i will feel like trash, is all that true?
4. How do you cope with people smoking around you? does it trigger smoking desires? does it get better with time?

Im open to hearing also all kinds of advice that you have.",3

About 4 Years ago I quit smoking cold turkey and I had been smoking most of my teen+ life (I‚Äôm under 30). I‚Äôd started rolling my own cigarettes for about a year then when I made the decision to stop I thought about how I can make myself hate smoking a little so I remembered the feeling I got when I used to roll a really bad one, it was so bad that it made me just drop it; With that in mind, I made it my focus to always roll them blocked, stuffed and with a longer filter so it became a pain to smoke it, after some months it became traumatizing when I thought about smoking, combine that with an already shortened breath and I actually genuinely hated it and that‚Äôs when I knew I had to quit now. 

To quit I‚Äôve spent 2 weeks doing absolutely nothing but eat, sleep and play on my phone (I‚Äôve completed all of the Mega Man Battle-Network GBA games)after that all the cravings I got when I was home were gone. 

The harder part was going out into the world and doing everyday stuff like driving (road rage was a mfkr) and sitting with friends in our usual places but it was easier since I still had the gross feeling for smokes that I built up over months. 

This went on for a couple of months, but then I had some personal issues coming that I feared might cause a flare up and ruin everything I worked for. That‚Äôs when I picked up vaping and I‚Äôve always had in mind that I WILL stop it too and kept telling myself that. Fast-forward 2 years and health greatly increased and I could actually bend over without getting short breathed and can run up the stairs without stopping to catch air. However, I still had that awful smoke dependence (I‚Äôm talking about the act of smoking it self not the nicotine) so I did what I did the last time ‚Äúmake myself hate it‚Äù and it was much easier this time with vaping, just bought bad tasting liquid, left the cotton wick to burn a little to add more bad taste and voila I hated vaping too. Now to the part that made me write this that I feel might‚Äôve been better to use at the start. 

Have I told I told you about our lord and our savior ..... nah! I‚Äôm kidding, got you though admit it.

What I really wanna talk about is the cravings. Since I smoked for more than half my life smoking was intertwined into everything I did so it was hard resisting that craving even vaping was used to quench the smoke cravings, but in these couple of weeks it dawned on me that I didn‚Äôt think once of vaping for one sole reason, there was a older more powerful craving I had that could beat smoking on any day. I‚Äôm talking about the need to eat. 

You see, i wanted to get more in shape so I decided to do r/IntermittentFasting and I chose the OMAD method (One Meal A Day) you choose an hour in the day to eat only one plate + a cup of juice preferably (if you have diabetes or any other health issue please checkout the other methods). And just like that all my smoke cravings were substituted by food cravings and those are manageable to better extent at least to me.",2

Couldn‚Äôt even finish it...even if it is not one full month, smoking in my memories does not taste like this.

Addiction is in the brain.
I should have not smoked it.
But now I am at least I am sure that smoking is not what i want to do to have fun.

If you anyone of you ends up relapsing, I just want you to know that having one cig or a few puffs along the way does not mean that you should give up quitting.

I will wake up tomorrow morning and continue as if I just did not have those few puffs from that cigarette.

We are human, we fail, we try again and most importantly we know what is right and what is wrong.

The urge to smoke is hard, especially if you are surrounded by smokers. Resisting the urge needs discipline and persistence.

Good luck to you all, do not give up !",17

I‚Äôm 21, smoked for six years, have been cigarette free for 12 days now. 

I didn‚Äôt quit because of health issues or anything like that, I genuinely didn‚Äôt notice (maybe because it just seemed normal to me; feeling more phlegm and chest tightness now, actually). Either way, the minor health issues I did notice were worth it in my mind because I love smoking. 

I love the taste, I love the feeling, I love how it gives me something to do with my hands while I‚Äôm standing outside. I even love the smell to be honest. It‚Äôs comforting to me. I love how it gives me something to channel my energy and focus into for about ten minutes so my mind isn‚Äôt going crazy while I‚Äôm simply sitting outside enjoying the day.

For the first time in my life i feel kind of ready to quit and stick with quitting. Every other time, I‚Äôve given in as soon as I felt the slightest craving; I don‚Äôt think I really wanted to try. Now I feel ready to keep going with it and not break my streak but I guess I‚Äôm wondering how you curb the cravings for the taste of a cigarette.

I may be alone here but I really do miss the taste. I know that another big thing for me is the oral fixation part of it. Whether it was vaping or smoking I always liked having something available to me 24/7 that I could suck on I guess lol.

Then my anxiety got worse and worse until I had a week where I only slept 1-3 hours. This developed into sleep anxiety and mild insomnia. I sleep relatively well now but I still worry every day whether I'll sleep well or not. This has been going on for almost four months or so.


This led to me slipping and smoking a couple of cigarettes about two weeks ago. I'm back to quitting now though.

 I've been reading about PAWS recently (post-acute withdrawal syndrome) where former addicts can experience anxiety, depression and sleep problems for up to 2 years after quitting their addiction. 

Which brings me to my question: can former smokers experience PAWS? If so, have any of you had it?",5

It was a big decision for me--I had leaned on nicotine as a crutch for so long and it was only 6 months since my dad passed. I know he would hate to see me smoking because of him. And I honestly wanted to quit too, I enjoyed biking and it was hard to do when you're smoking half a pack a day.

But I've stuck with it for over 3 years now and I want to tell you it gets easier. You can do it. You will never not be a nicotine addict. I almost bought a pack a month ago at a low point. But the best advice I had was to acknowledge the craving and then wait 5 minutes.

I am finally going to therapy and dealing with all the triggers I used to justify smoking. 

I wanted you to know that if I can do it, you can do it as well. I've reached the point where I am unsubscribing from this sub just because I don't need it anymore, but it was such a valuable community to me for so long. So thank you all and stick with it!!",8

My background is im a 31 year old who has smoked about 10 a day since age 14/15. I have been seriously trying to quit for about 10 years. I mean literally every pack is my last one. I've never met anyone so obsessed with quitting but so hopelessly unable to do so. I've tried vaping, juuling, every type of NRT, wellbutrin and Allan carr with varying levels of success but I always end up back smoking within a week or two. My max quit was 3 months. Its a running joke amongst my friends and family and they all laugh whenever I say I'm quitting.

I realised recently that I spend hours every day thinking about quitting when I'm smoking and thinking about smoking when I am quitting. How sad is that.  I decided that this is the year I need to break with this obsession for good. I have wasted months worth of time thinking about something I definitely  hate (but convince myself I love at the same time).

Anyway maybe someone else is in the same sort of weirdo as I am so heres how I'm feeling right now at 23 days quit. All of your success stories have really helped me over the years. Thanks for taking the time to write them

I quit using a nicorette quickmist for the 1st twelve days which got me past the 'I'll just buy one more pack"" so I am day eleven post nicotine.

1) After 2 weeks of terrible sleep I am definitely now sleeping longer and waking up feeling more refreshed. My garmin is showing more deep and REM sleep

2)  I feel excited about life in a way that I have only felt when I was young and during previous quit attempts. Its hard to describe. It comes in waves of positive feelings that are triggered by things like smelling rain or reading a book. 

3) All senses feel heightened

4) I have definite  brain fog still. Cant focus on anything for longer than 5min. From other posts it looks like this might last a while. I'm running regularly and drinking lots of water which seems to help a bit

5) This feels like a choice now rather than withstanding physical cravings. Once or twice a day I think about smoking but the cravings only last a couple of minutes. Every time it stops im glad I didn't cave which strengthens my resolve.

It gets easier. You got this folks!",25

I turn 30 this year and I knew I didn't want to carry this habit into another decade of life. I've tried to stop many times and I've slipped up many times. This is the most SURE I've felt while escaping this addiction. I have a therapist, a quit coach, meds, and NRT (patch, inhaler, and gum). I quit in September, November, and December (and many other times before that) so I knew I needed extra help lol.. 

But yea I just wanted to say there's no such thing as too much support and you should never be too hard on yourself. These companies have been perfecting the addictiveness of cigs for like 100 years and we've only been trying to get out from under it for a fraction of the time lol.

A lot of us are strong willed and disciplined in other areas of our lives and see our inability to quit easily as a personal failure or as a lack of discipline, but as my therapist told me ""If you could've willed and disciplined your way out from smoking, you would've."" This can be hard, but I think it's important to make sure you have people rooting for you and have professionals in your corner to help keep you accountable in a healthy, non shaming way as well as pure will and discipline.

Best of luck to everyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Skin is getting clearer and much softer. I had a lot of acne. Still got acne scars, but now I can hope they will get better. It seems cigs toxins were a major cause of my acne.

- More focus. I feel really more productive because of that. I now realize that my cigs were like smoking a small part of opium, just to escape reality and numb myself.

- No more shame. I work in a health related field, and I was so ashamed to hide myself to smoke, hoping no one would see me. Or starting to feel bad in a date because I needed to smoke, but I knew it would hurt my chances. This one is precious believe me.

- More energy. Cigarettes were definitely dragging me down as a human being. Now I feel alive.

- Saving money. Just go, look at your budget. It does not matter if you still smoke or you stopped. In both cases you'll know what I mean.

- Lost fat. Kinda counterintuitive. My theory is that smoking inflamed my gums, and gums disease decrease insulin sensitivity. Since I stopped, I can eat so much cards, and not always healthy ones, and I feel I lose fat everyday. Just keep in mind that I run 3-4X a week, and I take a lot of supplements.

- I breathe better and I will live longer, with a better quality of life.

I think that's about it.

Listing all those benefits help me stay on track. It's not worth it to lose all those positive sides just to take a few puffs. And I know the story, I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SMOKE JUST ONE CIGARETTE. It will lead to many others, and will take me back to my miserable life.

So, did you experience the same benefits as me ? What other ones have you witnessed ?

I‚Äôve wanted to for over 7 years, but never could get past day 3 or 4. My partner was a smoker, too, so if one of us was smoking, the other would be, too. 

My friend recommended that I download the ‚ÄúSmoke Free‚Äù app and I am so glad that I did. There are so many useful tools and information on there. For starters, you can see how much money you are saving. You can also fill out an entry every time you have a craving, if you do this correctly, you can start to see the different patterns and identify what your triggers to want to smoke happen to be. They give you ‚Äúmissions‚Äù every day, to help you fill out and keep your mind on the prize of wanting to quit smoking. If you allow for notifications, then you get messages once to twice a day, where they ‚Äúcheck up‚Äù on you. Plus, it gives you information on all the positives that are going on with your body. For example, by being 3 weeks smoke free, my pulse & oxygen levels are 100% back to normal. My lung function and immunity has improved by 16%. There is a long list that keeps you informed.  

This app also tallies up how many cigarettes you haven‚Äôt smoked, how many days of your life have been added back on, how much money you have saved, etc. 

The app had actually brought me to this page, which I thought was cool... it truly does provide you with so many resources. 

Anyways, have a wonderful weekend, y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm 22 days at this point, and absolutely flabbergasted because I never thought I could reach this far before! 

One more thing before I go - when you have a craving, it‚Äôs important to repeat the mantra ‚ÄúNo more puffs - no matter what!‚Äù The app also taught me (as does previous experience) that justifying ‚Äúonly one cigarette‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work. More than 95% of people who say that, end up smoking as much as they used to smoke.... so all that progress would go down the drain.

Kinda mad at myself,"IDK why I'm posting this, I'm not really asking for advice, I'm just lazy and need more discipline. I kinda want to vent though. I'm just really disappointed in myself, never thought I would pick up real cigarette that easy again after not touching one for that long, but oh well.. Sorry for this boring post.

So I switched from smoking to ecigarettes after struggling, trying to stop altogether and failing. It worked really well, my taste and smell came back, I saved tons of money and my clothes and hair smelled good again, washed all my jackets and been enjoying it.

Now after a few weeks my taste became really sensitive. I had found ONE SINGLE ejuice I loved and that made the switch to ecigarettes really easy.

Now because of covid the store I bought my liquid from is closed and there is no way to get this particular liquid online. I've tried a bunch of similar aromas and other liquids but my diy stuff all had a weird taste to it and I can't seem to get used to the other premade liquids I've tried. I smoked less and less of my ecigarettes and was hopeful I would give that up as well, albeit forced by circumstances.

But instead, I sadly gradually picked up smoking again, after being smoke free from mid September to new years.

If any of you have similar experiences, let me know.

At least I managed to get rid of another really bad habit, which was drinking only soda, 3x1,5 llter bottles per day (which came down to almost 1,800kcal per day on top of food, plus teeth damage) for as long as I can remember. I'm already losing weight lol, even though I could never quite believe that liquid calories count, or else I surely should've been overweight by now. But I'm noticing a huge difference, I'm also hungry all the time now. Been drinking tea with artificial sweetener and tap water.

Anyways, I'm hoping to quit cigarettes a second time soon, with the help of vapes, once I find a liquid I can get used to. Wish me luck!",5

I came to the conclusion that just quitting might not need to be the only way to be healthier _in the future_. 

I'm just spit balling, but, here is what i was thinking. 

So basically, we all know that smoking isn't healthy. That's just a fact. We also know, as of yet, that vaping isn't a safe alternative to it. So why that?

I figured that it mostly comes from the body's regenerative / ""healing"" process to keep up with the ill effects of smoke / vapor inhalation. 

What if you could amplify the body's ability to regenerate, so you would basically create an even playing field, like it would be if you didn't smoke? And what would that be? The increase of the metabolic process? 

This definitely seems more viable (to me, i have no deep knowledge), than creating a safe cigarette, since something always has to be burned or heated up to inhale something, therefore releasing / creating (?) The chemicals that hurt the body / it's tissue. So in the way i mention it's basically dealing with the ill effects without changing the product itself.

All i found on the subject that relates in a general way, is [this](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121116-can-we-ever-have-safe-cigarettes).",1

I've been smoking for more than 8 years. There were high and lows. One day I just decided to quit. I recently came across the smoke free app and this thread because of it. It has helped me a bit. I've not been successful in quitting. The longest I've quit is for a month. It had been 2 weeks since I've quit. But then I had a bad breakup, followed by a panic attack, and before I realised, I had a smoke. I'm not gonna lie. It felt good, but I knew that it's not gonna end up in a good way. That continued and more I'm a regular smoker. It's just the stress and the breakup just made me get a smoke and i couldn't control it. 

And I hate myself for it. I've been in and out of depression. I used to smoke pot and drink. I've been free of them for more than 4 years. But cigarettes, somehow I'm not able to get it out of my system. I've been using those nicotine gums which helped me for these 2 weeks. But it seems they aren't helping anymore. I've been smoking more or less a pack everyday. 

I'm really looking forward to some tips from those who have successfully quit. What do you do when they going gets tough? How do I get smoking it of my system?",3

Do you have any good tricks to keeping the urge down or your mind busy while at work? Other than snacks. Or is just about mental strength and discipline. 

It was nice but I immediately regretted it afterwards. The smoke taste was already not very pleasing but the feeling of smoking was still nice.

2021-01-21 23:08:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/l2folh/one_year_coming_up/,One year coming up,".. since my big brother died of lung cancer caused by smoking. He would've turned 42 this week.
I woke up at 3am this morning and I can't stop thinking about him, and that's what led me here.
My wife is asleep, so it's a good time to do some crying so I don't have to bother her with it, since there's nothing she can do to help.

We're a little less than two months from the anniversary of his death.
The new year's eve was a mess. I drank way too much, because I decided to do that instead of spend it going over how much I miss him, and how the last new year's eve I spent the day with him in the hospital, since he was in too bad shape, and I came home from there to a party.

I wonder how many new year's eves it will take before I don't get sad remembering that.
It's like that damn cancer was able to tarnish all the good times we had, since it was the last thing that was left, and whenever I remember my brother, I first have to wade through the memories of that cancer to get to the good parts.

His death made me realize how much pain and devastation the losing of a loved one too early can cause. My sister keeps dreaming of him and visits his grave at least once a week. My other big brother spent the christmas drunk visiting his grave instead of joining us, since he remembers the last Christmas when I was able to pick our brother from the hospital and bring him to celebrate it with us.
His teenager niece (and goddaughter) is constantly afraid of who she's going to lose next.

I read about cancer to better understand it, and how it works, and the lung cancer caused by smoking has to be on the top 3 of the worst ones.
You might not even notice it before it's way too late and it's managed to spread through your body, at which point the war is probably lost, and you're just fighting to prolong the inevitable. For a cell to become cancerous, several mutations have to occur to allow it to bypass first it's own failsafes, and then to fool your immune system into being a good guy. A single mutation is not enough, it requires specific genes to be disabled/enabled. After that happens, it's able to start replicating and mutating more. It's your cell, your dna, finding new ways to grow and spread, trying all it can to survive. It'll divert blood flow to get more nutrients to grow faster, attach itself to bones and start eating them for resources. After it's spread, there's very little you can do. Chemo, radiation, surgery.. those are there to slow it down, but a spread lung cancer is too mutated and too well protected to die of those. If you're lucky, some immunotherapy will fit your cancer (didn't for my brother) or some kind of miracle happens and your body figures out a way to fight it on it's own. Otherwise, it's months of pain and you and your loved ones hoping and getting those hopes crushed one after another until finally they tell you it's time to move to palliative care. For my brother that meant a week left in his life, unable to breathe without an oxygen mask, his spine being at the brink of collapsing, his left lung consisting of a huge single tumor, and small tumors popping up everywhere. A pneumonia raised his fever and luckily for our medicine, his final moments were numbed by different forms of morphine and I don't know what. Our mother spent the last night in his room but was unable to be there for the end. His girlfriend, my brother and sister were the only ones in the room when he drew his last breath. He drew several ones with a pause between them until the final one, whole I thanked him for everything he had done for all of us, after which a lifeless body was left.
I remember how warm he felt when I hugged him. I put my head on his chest and said my goodbyes. During his final months the hugs had to be soft, barely a touch, because it might hurt him, and now I was at least able to feel him.

I felt like writing something here, since I'm not sure who else to talk to for it to have any meaning. I'm of the opinion that smoking should be made illegal since it's crazy to me that it's okay for a multi billion dollar cancer industry to exist and be allowed to get more people addicted and somehow be able to convince people that it's their choice. My brother started smoking when he was 13, maybe 14 years old. He was addicted for the rest of his life, unable to quit and boy did he try.

When he called me that Tuesday asking for a lift to the hospital he already knew. He started crying in the car and apologized for what he was about to cause for us. I tried to comfort him and tell him to take it one step at a time, it could be just a heavy cold or something. One week after that the diagnosis was clear and he was apologizing to the rest of the family as well. Like I'd blame him. I just think about the owners of tobacco companies and people working for them and it makes me want to vomit. My brother didn't choose to kill himself via lung cancer using tobacco and his last months were filled with regret over not being able to beat the habit.
Guess what. After seeing all that, my other brother is still smoking. Does he choose to do it? It's an addiction, and it's a huge uphill battle to beat it. Others may have it easier, and for some it's nearly impossible.

I want to encourage you all to try. You may sometimes tell yourself what does it matter what I do. But the people who love you don't have a choice in it, even less than you do. If not for you, do it for them. No parent should have to bury their children, and no child should lose their parent, uncle or aunt that way.

I miss him so fucking much. Thank you for reading and I hope with all my heart you'll have the strength to remove this cause for sorrow from your life. If you have any symptoms at all, go get an x-ray. Maybe you'll catch it early enough. Get enough sleep. Exercise. Eat healthy food. Enjoy, love and live.",24

My mom's been smoking for almost 40 years. She comes from a country where drugs are serious taboos and illegal so alcohol and smoking are the strongest substance that people can do; had she been grown in the US, I'm sure she would have gotten into hard drugs. I mention all of these things because she acts like a drug addict. Our family struggled economically growing up and even though sometimes there weren't food in the pantry, I knew for sure she would have enough cigarettes stocked up. When I confront her to stop. She gets very defensive and aggressive. Even when she's coughing like she's dying of pneumonia, she smokes at least pack a day and I hear her go outside the house once an hour to smoke and come back.

I don't know what to do. She's not even at the stage where she admits that she has a problem; she doesn't think she's doing anything wrong. The only option I can think of is shaming her into quitting. She's very conscientious of showing her smoking to other people so I'm thinking of revealing her smoking habits to her sister and her mother. But that would probably damage my relationship with my mom, which isn't that great to begin with.",1

And I seem to get out of breath even while I'm talking. Its actually driving me crazy and tempted to go to doc. I know I'm not sick because I've been dealing with it for a couple months and I have no other symptoms. So why 10 months into not smoking would this be happening?

After smoking for over 5 years I quit cold turkey last week. I felt fine until day 3 when the withdrawal hit like a ton of bricks and I was scared I had covid, I felt so sick.
Now I‚Äôm on day 8, and every day I‚Äôve had a bad headache, fatigue, crazy mood swings along with that flu-like ickiness. My biggest challenge at the moment is a super stuffy nose and not being able to smell and having super diminished taste because of it.
Any other year I wouldn‚Äôt be panicking but I keep wondering if I‚Äôm actually sick or not? I keep trying to research and get so many mixed symptom timelines and severities.
If any of y‚Äôall have quit cold turkey and had a similar experience, please let me know. I‚Äôm just concerned I might have a flu, or worse have covid, and not know because I keep writing it all off as detox symptoms.
Thanks!",2

I‚Äôm 22 years old and have also smoked a ridiculous amount of pot over the years starting at the same age. Up until this past year it was every day, multiple times a day (6-8 times at the worst) , and each session was 1-3 bowl snaps (you smoke an entire bowl in one hit, my tolerance was through the roof). This past year has been around once at night with one bowl snap. The vaping, has been non-stop. I could not go an hour without vaping and most of the time would just keep it in my hand and chain.    To add to it I would buy the highest salt nicotine juice possible. I‚Äôm an engineering student so most of my time is spent studying/doing homework so i really got habitual about vaping constantly. It‚Äôs safe to say I never gave my lungs a fighting chance. 

Here‚Äôs where the lung issue comes in. About 4 days ago I had horrible chest pain when breathing. I went to the doc the next morning when it didn‚Äôt stop and they ordered a chest x ray. They couldn‚Äôt find what caused the pain and my doctor says most likely it was pleurisy unrelated to smoking and since the pain was subsiding after 2 days, it‚Äôs no big deal. However, they did find that I have mildly hyper inflated lungs and recommended I stop vaping/smoking immediately. He said that this is normally something they see in old people with emphysema, but an alarming amount of young people who vape have been developing similar issues. In his words, this is a warning signal from my body that it is not responding well to what I‚Äôm putting in it and it is likely it will progress and I‚Äôll have lung disease by 30 if I continue. Although, due to my age, the damage is reversible. I‚Äôve been off both weed and the vape for 4 days and won‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs been rough. I keep trying to justify smoking in my mind because I did it so heavily. I‚Äôll tell myself if I don‚Äôt do it as much I‚Äôll be fine. I know it sounds so immature and ungrateful, but I get angry that it‚Äôs me with this issue already. My grandparents smoked like chimneys into their 60s and nothing. I‚Äôve had medical issues in the past, unrelated to smoking, and it just feels like I keep getting dealt shitty hands. I know I brought it upon myself though. 

Does anyone have hyper inflated lungs? Did it ever go away? Was this god sending me a message to stop by having me get a chest x ray for an issue unrelated to my lung function? Do you ever smoke marijuana? (I‚Äôve had to stop with weed anyways because of my career prospects being big testers for security clearance, but wonder if I‚Äôll ever be able to spark again with federal legalization on the horizon). How do you guys manage your relationships while being a complete asshole from withdrawals? Any advice or even a relatable story would be appreciated.",1

I smoked blunts and vaporized (different from a vape) tobacco for a while, but over time the buzz became weak and the temptation strong. My quitting experience wasn't bad at all using a strategy I will layout for you. The first vape I bought, Nord by Smok was actually stronger than my desktop vaporizer, it gave me a sizeable buzz. I used this for about a month as much as I had been before. I then switched to the next vape, which is the most important step. 

This next vape was a pen that took refillable cartridges. Vape pens are much weaker than other vapes AND have 3 or more different voltages, mine ranged from 2-5 V. This voltage range lets you slowly taper down to the lowest voltage, getting less nicotine while still getting the feeling of putting something to your lips and inhaling. Once I reached 2 V, I stayed there for about a week. My last day smoking nicotine was New Year's Eve partying with my brother. The next two days we sat around smoking weed watching Narcos. I had zero withdrawal symptoms, I think because I was happy and baked. 

I would highly recommend quitting using vapes (especially the multiple voltage pen). If you can do it on New Year's Eve it is especially motivating. And if you can smoke weed during the initial withdrawal period it will be perfect.",1

I'm almost 24, smoking for about 7 years since about 17.
My family smoke so this is kind of a behavior which i have seen as acceptable from early in life.
As i grow up i found in myself surrounded by friends and co worker who smokes.
I used to smoke a pack a day. The only thing stopped me each say from lighting another cig was the counting to 20(usually happens before bed time) and saying to myself ""thats enough for today"".

As of today i stopped smoking for almost 5month which isn't big accomplishment I'm aware but it is a start(been alot harder because covid staying at home). I'm telling you that you WON'T find bigger addict than me, and if i was able to put an end to my own devastated behavior so can you ! Believe in yourself!
You owe it to yourself , not anybody else.

What helped me to change my mindset ?
*I don't wish to be a smoking parent.
*I do wish a healthy life for myself.
*I wish to have control over my own action.
*I wished to stop smelling bad.(your perfume won't hide the cigs)
*i wish to not encounter any problem in bed.
*i wish to not have teeth problems.(expensive and disgusting)
*WILL POWER*
*wanting to save money instead of burning it.
*telling smokers i know that i have stopped.


What didn't help me to change my mindset ?
*telling myself i can stop anytime i want.(then why don't i?) 
*hanging around people who see this bad addiction as legitimate .
*vaping.(don't trick yourself)
*thinking about it.(fill your time with something)
*taking 1 last cig.
*taking 1 last puff.



Both those lists can keep going forever. I ask from you today to write on your cellphone or on paper why do you want to stop and what is bad about it, after that start writing why you want to keep smoking. Now take a look on what you wrote by yourself and let reality sink in and strike you.

PLEASE value your life and life of your loved ones.
 
I know its not much, but i don't intend on going back.

Every time I extinguish my ‚Äúlast‚Äù cig I tell myself there is nothing to miss, I won‚Äôt miss it and I don‚Äôt need this shit in my life.

I already know the right thing to do, why am I torturing myself?

It‚Äôs a vicious cycle & I want out of it, but I need to convince my logical mind to be smarter than the monster in me dragging me back down.

Anyone else with this vicious cycle? It‚Äôs like no matter how much I tell my mind there‚Äôs nothing to miss, that addiction convinces the shit out of me.

I know that this thread is for smokers, but there isn't much support out there for chewing tobacco, and I hope that, being that its all nicotine, that someone could help me. Its been slightly over five months since I quit. The first 4-6 weeks were pure hell. The anxiety, mood swings, sinus problems, and sleeplessness were enough to make me think I would die each and every day. After 6 weeks, things started to improve. I would still experience the rollercoaster of quitting, but the highs seemed to stay a little longer and the lows seemed to not last as long. Fast forward to five months, and I still experience bouts of anxiety and sinus problems which I assume are attributed to nicotine cravings like in the beginning. I went to the doctor about my sinuses and he said that it will take at least a year before they normalize. I know it has only been five months, but, for me, it has felt like an absolute eternity. Today I am feeling very down and defeated like I have in the past few months. It's like I am stuck in this fog forever and its never going to get better. I don't want to be stuck like forever in life. It just is not worth it.

What was your quitting timeline like after the first month or two? Did it take you six months or more to feel ""normal""? Did anyone ever experience bouts of anxiety or sinus problems this far out from quitting? Did it just keep getting better?

Readjusting the mindset has been so difficult this time. I already know and have all the information, but I convince myself just one more, multiple times a day every day.

&#x200B;

I've been a pack a day smoker for 12 years.  When I was introduced to vaping, I allowed myself to vape indoors, at night, in social situations in which smoking would be unacceptable, but I could ""stealth vape"".  I never went 30 minutes without hitting some sort of nicotine, except when I was asleep, I'd often find myself chain smoking the night away.

I thought I was so much more addicted than any of my other friends, who were also smokers, but seemed to be able to stretch a pack soo much longer than I could.

Of course I thought I'd never change.

I had a baby girl in October last year.  I thought quitting was going to be an incredibly stressful experience, and even though I felt guilty about it, I didn't really even try to quit.  It wasn't until my wife approached me early December, essentially holding my feet to the fire telling me I need to quit for our daughter.  I told her I would come New Years.  Its far enough away I thought, at least I can smoke for just a little longer.

It's been 20 days since I've last touched any form of nicotine.  It feels so fucking easy now.  I have a very addictive personality, and reading others horror stories I felt it was going to be hell.  It wasn't at all. My mind tried to trick me many times, saying I could get away with just one, but I didn't smoke.  I felt short tempered and dizzy, sometimes super 'out of it', still didn't.

&#x200B;

Of course I realize I'm far from ""free"" of addiction, but holy shit guys it was so much easier to get to where I am now than I thought it would be. I'm 100% sure I can keep going, and I'm 100% sure that you can too.

&#x200B;

STOP making excuses. Stop thinking you're not determined enough, and stop thinking it's not the right time. I did all of these things, and it was still fucking easy.

&#x200B;

Tips:

1. (Subreddit broken record, i know) Allen Carr's easy way book.  I only ready like 1/3 of it, but I still kept in mind his change of ""mindset""
2. Sunflower seeds and gum.  Keep your mouth busy.
3. Keep your MIND busy.  I played games, and watched videos for three days straight. Luckily I started during new years, so I had new years day off and took the long weekend as a chance.
4. Don't let your mind trick you into thinking you ""loved"" smoking.  Believe me, my mind tried.  You don't love smoking, your addiction does.  Smoking is expensive as fuck, makes you stink, and will KILL you.  Think of everything you GAIN by not smoking, and fight through the temptation. It will be over soon.",5

First of all, I am going to apologize for any formatting trouble as I am posting from my mobile. 

I just feel like I need to say, ""I am going to quit smoking."" Even if it is to a bunch of strangers. Even if it is just to the vast empty space that is the internet. 

We (my family and I) were so careful with trying to dodge the covid bullet. We literally stripped in our mudroom, after entering from the garage. All clothes went into the washing machine that is located there. Keys wallets and pocket contents went into a stainless steel bowl and disinfected. We had out groceries delivered and wiped everything down. We sheltered in place as much as our essential working jobs allowed. Dammed if we didn't all get it right before Thanksgiving. My daughter first as a Senior in high school. Then my wife who works at the elementary school. Then I a refinery operator came down with it. Finally my son, who had been doing a marvelous job of self motivating and was online learning came down with it. All within a matter of days. 

We fared well. We had surprisingly mild symptoms. We were lucky. I was struggling a bit in the month that followed. Still not able to breathe as well as before the virus. I pushed through. That is until I came under some extra stress at work. Suddenly my cough became more frequent and the breathing was quicker. Anxiety related? Possibly. I pushed through another day. The next morning my coughing fits left me gagging and even caused me to throw up a couple of times. I called off shift from the parking lot and my wife came to pick me up because I was having that hard of a time not coughing that I feared it made the fourteen mile trip home a risky proposition. I went to the doctor. Pneumonia. Not what I was hoping to hear. I was prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics. I still had a smoke here and there. Now because my nerves demanded it. Literally felt like I was breathing through a wet towel....still I smoked. 

Then the allergic reaction to the antibiotic came, some eight hours after my first dose. It started as a small rash on the left side of my neck. It spread to the other side. I smoked now because I was scared and thought it would calm me. It now covered my whole throat and my I could feel my tongue and tonsils start to swell. Had another cigarette. Called the doctor's after hours line. Took to Benadryl and worried my wife sick that I may swell so bad I physically wouldn't be able to breathe. Swelling in my tongue and throat started to subside. I could breathe easier, but it was still difficult. The benadryl was starting to work. I grew drowsy. I went out to the garage and had my customary cigarette before bed. The irony of smoking when I can't breathe never entering my brain, just the desire to have one. My wife figured out what I was doing and had a ""come apart"" to put it lightly. She was right. I went to bed. She slept restlessly checking on me throughout the night to make sure I could still breathe. 

The alarm went of at 4 a.m. as it usually does when I work day shift. I got up and fumbled my way through the darkness of the house. Grabbed my robe and a diet coke and headed to the garage. Mindlessly lit a cigarette and took a drag. I realized how congested I was as I stood there. It was worse than yesterday. Took another drag. Felt like the nicotine wasn't getting there. Probably because of all the gunk in my lungs. Somewhere the light bulb started to feebly flicker in my brain. I always knew that I was doing something unhealthy as I smoked, but this was next level. I could hardly breathe and somewhere inside of me I was angry my nicotine fix seemed delayed. When did I let it come to this? I have been doing this for 30 years mindlessly. I helped destroy my health without a thought that I couldn't easily push aside. I'm done. The power I have given this addiction over my life will kill me if I don't. All without a second thought. It is still not going to be easy even with the direness of the situation. I will however, not smoke with you today. 

If you made it this far, thank you and I hope your quit is in progress. If not please don't be as dedicated to killing yourself as I just realized I was.",4

Hi all,

New here but been lurking the past week. I've been a smoker for about 9 years- . I've smoked daily for the past 6ish years,  always mixed weed & tobacco (so I guess its an addiction to both - more mental for weed and more physical for nicotine).

Currently on day 4 - to be honest it hasn't been too bad, minus the odd craving at night when I have a bit of a void from not smoking (i.e. just habit), some trouble sleeping, some sweating and a couple of headaches.

One thing I've noticed potentially is my libido isnt quite as high as it has been. To be honest I've mostly quit as embarassingly my erections havent been staying up as much as Id like recently and im 28. Hoping to see some positive changes in this department in a few weeks as circulation improves. Anyone else notice much in this department?

So yeah cheers for the support community. Looking forward to better health & more cash.

2021-01-20 11:16:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/l1cb11/officially_unsubscribing/,Officially unsubscribing.,"Hi everyone.  I'm writing this post as a celebration for myself and maybe to pass along some good vibes to someone who may be starting out.  I picked up smoking when I went off to college around 2005-2006 and before I knew it I was hooked.  Like so many others I had tried quitting on my own without much success.  The longest I made it was around two weeks and every failed attempt made me unhappier with myself.

Discovering this sub was the single largest factor in my eventual success.  Because of this sub, I found Alan Carr's Easy Way which was the catalyst for my mental transformation. From others who posted in this sub, I learned about different strategies for getting through cravings. I learned to personify my cravings as the little nicotine demon I became obsessed with killing.

I got to share in the celebration of others who posted about their successes.  I learned to be proud and grateful for my growing number of smoke-free days when I read about others who were really struggling to get off the ground. In the early days I would check in to this sub when I was feeling frustrated and would always find whatever I needed to feel better. I learned to take ownership of the road to quitting and decided that quitting cigarettes wasn't a challenge to overcome, it was one of my life's greatest opportunities.

I quit in 2015 for about a year. I picked it back up in 2016 as I was finishing up grad school but the relapse was short lived as I started dating a wonderful girl that would eventually become my fiancee (kisses were off the table with cigarettes around, made the decision easier).

I've been cigarette free now for around 4.5 years. Since quitting, I've lost a bunch of weight, run a marathon, rode 104 miles on a bicycle ride, completed a 34 mile cross country ski race, completed a few triathlons, earned a doctorate degree, found my wife, learned how to work out in a gym, learned how to save money and landed a dream job. Every facet of my life improved after I stopped smoking cigarettes. Once you've got quitting under your belt, other goals suddenly become a lot less daunting. 

So to this sub, I say thank you. To all of you on the journey to being a nonsmoker, take it one day at a time, one hour at a time if you need to and check in to this sub as often as you can. Even though I don't know you, I am really excited for you. Great things are coming.

I've recently bought a grill and have since subscribed to r/smoking to get tips on cooking.  There's only room for one smoking subreddit in my feed, so this one, fortunately, needs to go.

I‚Äôve started smoking and I was doing it on daily bases. Studying, going out with my classmates and smoking together, hidden from the crowd of adults in the park after school. I‚Äôve met new people from these secret gatherings and days were passing by.

I‚Äôve been in the desperate situations many times because I was young and had no money to go ahead and buy a packet of cigarettes every time I‚Äôve wanted. My parents were giving me just enough money for food and what I was doing instead was buying a cheap popcorn instead so I could spend half of my money for two pieces of cigarettes. Unfortunately for me there were people selling them by pieces or I think I wouldn‚Äôt be smoking that much afterwards.

Years went by and smoking was already a part of my life. I‚Äôve managed to get a job in amusement park at the age of 15, selling tickets and monitoring kid‚Äôs playground. I finally had my own money to buy a pack of cigarettes but I didn‚Äôt like spending the miserable amount of money I‚Äôve earned working 10 hour shift everyday.

I can say that I was your average Joe, smoking a pack everyday and sometimes +- 5 pieces of a new pack. 

I‚Äôve lost my best friend in the beginning of 2016 with whom I‚Äôve been smoking, drinking and doing all the friends stuff with since second grade. He died from the gas leaking in his own house alongside his own brother. 
I was terrified and scared. I was feeling lonely, I couldn‚Äôt listen to any teachers and what they were explaining to me. The last thing I‚Äôve wanted to do was to study at that time. Yet, no teacher wanted to understand that.

I just felt like writing this because thoughts and memories of smoking came to my mind today. 

Cigarette prices were increased in my country. Because of the feeling of being ripped off, I‚Äôve bought the cheapest vape I could find and quit smoking that day. I was using vape for a week and threw it away afterwards as well. I have started to appreciate my own life after losing my friend due to that terrible accident. I realised that life is too short to make it even worse by smoking a cigarette everyday.

I‚Äôve been smoke free since 2016. That‚Äôs almost 6 years of smoking I‚Äôve left behind.

If you‚Äôre reading this I want to let you know that I‚Äôm much better person now. I was a skinny dude and now I‚Äôm exercising daily. I‚Äôve become more muscular, I no longer gasp for the air when going up a few set of stairs. 

I look at the cigarette pricing now and all of them are doubled if not more (I‚Äôm from Georgia, the country)

Stay healthy and remember, there is nothing good in smoking. You‚Äôll be left with worse skin, worse teeth and breath. Always with the smell of cigarettes on your clothes without you even realising it and much more. I‚Äôm not here to tell you all the bad sides the smoking has because you‚Äôve probably heard all of them together but I look back in the past and I‚Äôm proud of myself for quitting. One of the best, life changing decision of my life.",5

I want to tell you my story how I stopped smoking. I don't smoke since 2 years now. 

I started to vape with the intention to reduce the amount of cigarettes I smoked (20 a day!) a few days in, I no longer needed to smoke any cigarettes. I slowly reduced the nicotin over monthts until I was vaping pure liquid. After that I vaped less and less until I fully quit that too. 

I still love the smell of cigarettes and will never even try one cigarette again cause I know I would be right in addiction again. 

It was my 3th attempt to quit, before I was trying the cold turkey method and nicotin band aids. 

I know this doesn't work for everyone, but it did for me. Maybe you give it a go if you haven't tried it yet.

I quit cold turkey - I am 46 - smoked 33 years - 25 cigs a day. 
2 tricks I used to get me to this point. 
1.
I fought my cravings with doing planks on my knuckles as this challenged my abs and caused pain in my knuckles - all in all made me focus on that instead of the craving.
2.
I had to learn not to only fight this with willpower - but instead remove my desire. When I have cravings I imagine Gollum speaking to me and he just wants his precious cigarette. I say to myself ‚Äúthanks for sharing - but you are wrong - I don‚Äôt need a cigarette‚Äù. 
Good luck and power to all.",14

I just wanted to share with you all that I have recently quit smoking and it has been 5 Days without any nicotine whatsoever! I have always had a very difficult time with the first day in the past (Just logging that first 24 hours). But I think that reading Allen Carr's Quit smoking the easy way book really changed my outlook on quitting! 

I just wanted to suggest that anyone who is having a difficult time or getting ready to quit, to give this book a quick read! It is only about 120 pages, basically, the book helps you to change your outlook on quitting by helping you realize that you are not giving anything up, but, freeing yourself from a lifetime of addiction. These simple mind tricks really have helped me make a significant leap! 

I went began riding my bike 3 days in and noticed such a huge difference in my breathing. Climbing and hillwork used to kill me and now I have noticed that getting up hills has been a breeze. I was so surprised to see just how impactful smoking was for my breathing. This huge difference also is extremely motivating to keep going with my quit journey!

Anyways, you can find the book on this website: [http://libgen.rs](http://libgen.rs)

I really encourage anyone who's is having a hard time to give it a read! I have barely thought about having any nicotine since finishing the book and my last cigarette! 

Good luck my friends and stay strong!",8

I quit cigarettes on the day after Christmas becuase I ran out of packs, and I simply didn't go buy more. However, I continued to vape to taper off the cravings. Vaping never came close, but it took the edge off a little bit.

Last weekend, the tank on my mod broke, and I just didn't replace it. Now I'm going through withdrawals again. The doubts and horrible feelings in my stomach are all coming back. The feeling in my throat is there. I would not recommend this way of quitting to anyone. For me, going through it a second time so shortly after the other is dangerous. I won't smoke again, but I could see this being too much.

If vaping is going to help you quit cigarettes, do what you got to do. But, if you want to quit both, I recommend quitting both at the same time. It's not fun going right back through this as if I hadn't stopped.",10

I have been a heavily addicted, one-pack-per-day smoker for about ten years and I tried to quit several times for the last four years of my smoking career. Sometimes I managed it for three months, sometimes for not even a day. It stressed and depressed me a lot that I couldn‚Äôt manage to quit. Most times I got back to smoking after a stressful situation, a stroke of fate, a drunken night or after I pulled on a spliff in a circle of friends. The next day, the urge was so strong that I gave in with the excuse, only one cigarette won‚Äôt hurt and tomorrow is another day to quit. At the end, it seemed like an endless struggle and the process of quitting absorbed most of my energy and the quality of my mood hit rock bottom. 

Here is what helped me to quit for good this time:

1) Do not negotiate with yourself but realize that you will let go of smoking for good. We all know that ‚Äúonly one‚Äù is  one big self-deception when it comes to tobacco being one of the heaviest addictive substances humanity is aware of.
2) Feel how you resonate with the thought of never ever smoking again, even on your death bed.
3) Don‚Äôt panic if you are not ready to make this decision. Instead, observe your smoking pattern systematically and once you feel ready, set an exact quitting date and quitting time in the near future that has some personal meaning to you. 
4) Prepare for this date some days before. Tell all your friends you stop, write down your reasons to stop, install the smokefree app, change the cigarette brand, throw away all your ash trashes, get a talisman, write down if-then-implementations, prepare a mantra that you tell yourself in difficult situations and so on. 
5) At the predefined quitting time, make a small ritual. I for example put on a necklace that served me as my nonsmoker talisman. Be happy. You are free. 
6) Do not look back any second, forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.

I hope this little review can help some people who are at the edge of beginning their journey. If I was able to inspire only one person in this sub, I am the happiest person. Thank you. Stay strong. Stay free. Be bold.",34

But even though I don‚Äôt feel like smoking and have no cravings, I am now since last week in the foulest mood. Like hyper aggressive, hyper angry. Everyone annoys the shit out of me. I am usually really sweet, but right now, it‚Äôs like a Hulk inside of me and it literally takes all I have not to yell at everyone all day long. Sometimes I even have to restreint from getting physical (i am never that aggressive, never, seriously, I am a  well behaved, articulate middle age lady with a reputation of being extra nice).   

I have the shortest temper ever, and almost no restraint, like I yelled at my boss last week (happily for a good enough reason for him to let it pass), am avoiding people and friends because I am afraid I might yell at them too. It‚Äôs crazy, and it‚Äôs 24/7 and it‚Äôs harder now than when I stopped almost 4 weeks ago. 

I know it‚Äôll pass, like it passed last time, but I am still amazed and scared of the personality change linked with the cigarette withdrawals. 

Anyone experiencing something similar? Especially this late in the process? What do you do to get over your extrem irritation? 

Tl;dr: I am Hulk since I stopped smoking. Anyone  else feeling the same? Any tips to get over it?",6

- Visualized myself throwing away all cigarettes in garbage can.
- Also threw away all weed smoking materials: glass pipe and all the medical containers of weed.
- Took away all the alcohol in my apartment.
- Downloaded Smoke Free app.
- Utilize Smoke Free app everyday.
- Read relatable stories from smokers on Reddit so I don‚Äôt feel so alone.
- Choosing to use my time for self help instead of self harm.

Just to name a few....
I am 36 years old and I was a smoker for 16 years. I am a mother to a 10 year old boy. It was easy to quit when I was pregnant because my health was no longer just about me but also for my baby. But after my baby was about 6 months old and my postpartum depression was so bad I started smoking again. Through the years my son has gotten older and has seen me smoke outside to take ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù. It really hit me this year when my husband filed for divorce. That‚Äôs a whole other story. But I started smoking soooo much during the covid pandemic and this divorce. But my son started to tell me that he doesn‚Äôt like it that I smoke and he doesn‚Äôt want me to die. And that really hit me and I knew I had to change my bad habits. I want to be a great mother and a great woman in life. So I am changing all sorts of old behavior in my life to new positive behavior. It‚Äôs a challenge everyday. But I think aging has helped me see things differently. 
These 17 days of smoke free lungs and sobriety have been the clarity I‚Äôve been searching for. I‚Äôll I had to do is take action. The Smoke Free app has been the most helpful. I read ‚ÄúThe Easy Way To Stop Smoking ‚Äú and ‚ÄúThe Easy Way For Women to Stop Smoking ‚Äú and they helped. But I like how this Smoke Free app has health percentage tools on how certain things in your body improve everyday you stay a non smoker. I like the visuals of that and it helps me feel productive and successful. The daily explorations are great because it gives me the chance to journal my thoughts about not smoking. I like how the app asks you questions about it and I answer it with my pure honesty and there is no judgement. That makes me feel safe. And I think feeling safe and secure on my journey is what has helped.",21

I was a vivid smoker for 13 years and it had shaped my identity, behaviour and dictated the way I interact/socialize with others. I always had a love/hatred relationship with tobacco. On one hand , it gave me a feeling of hype/awakening ( being fooled obviously) and on another- I saw it eating my body and dragging me to make bad choices.
 
The toll tobacco use takes on our bodies and our mind is striking and one wonders: how does big tobacco corps. sleep at night? and who makes it possible for them to inflict this horrible drug on 100s of million of people and destory lives? 

Tobacco and cigarettes destory lives and makes one a slave until his demise unless if you can escape it( We know how hard that is )

I feel a lot better, but I started vaping just as a tool to quit smoking. I had to start on 50mg nicotine salts just to actually quit. I'm at 18mg now because I've been reducing every week. Its been working really well for me.

But, thanks to my years of smoking and poor oral hygiene, i had an abcessed tooth that went wild 3 weeks or so after i quit cigarettes. It spread like wildfire. It was terrifying. One day, im fine, the next day, the whole right half of my face is swollen.

I have to get that pulled late this week/early next week once i finish my antibiotics up. So that means instead of tapering like I have, I'm going to have to take the jump to zero earlier than i anticipated. Its been a great tool for me when nothing else ive tried has worked. The withdrawals are nothing like cigarette withdrawals. If i had to choose, id take these all day. The only reason i want some 0 handy is so i can identify what triggers me to want to smoke and its a safety net while i work out the psychological issues. If i cave, im set back a hit of vapor and i learned something else that makes me want to smoke. That's what got me last time, and im in this quitting thing for the long-haul. Whatever it takes.

I'm nervous about this tooth extraction (dental phobia), but i guess thats what smoking does. Im lucky it was one tooth and not my whole mouth.

The good news is i dont have to say i smoke cigarettes anymore and they tell you congratulations when you tell them you just stopped üòÇ also my teeth are much whiter (still stained but its fine),so my mouth could have looked a lot worse and it could have been much more embarrassing for me than it already is.

Wish me luck, im absolutely terrified, but the good news is i can get over my fear and start taking back control of my oral health.",2

Side note... I started feeling sick on the first as well and got covid! All I kept thinking during my sickness was.... How could I be so stupid to keep smoking. I should have quit when I found out we were in a global pandemic affecting breathing in order to let my body heal before I eventually get it... So, I hope if you haven't quit already, or you are thinking about taking a puff, remember how you are preparing your lungs and body for health in case you get covid. :)",1

I don't remember a day without cigarettes until a couple of months ago; and I used to smoke 1.5-2 packs a day on average.

I tried to quit smoking once before with help of Champix. It was a relative success (for my standards), I had reduced to 3-4 cigarettes a day until I quitted Champix instead of cigarettes when I was on a long road trip, due to its side effects (anxiety, stress and loss of focus), which were quite frightening while driving for long hours every day
I quickly moved back to 2 packs a day (within a week).

This is the second time I try quitting again with Champix. I decreased number of cigarettes for the first 40 days and stopped completely, for the first time, at day 40. I finished that second month's pills and stopped taking Champix after that too.

It was surprisingly easy for most of the time, for instamce to drink coffee and tea without smoking (I expected that to be very hard), but I can't say the same for alcohol. I started to carry small cigars (cigarillos) as something, in my opinion, less addictive. After a month or so, it became a habit to smoke only cigars and only when I go out drinking, and unlike cigarettes, I didn't feel like having a cigar the day after.

The problem started with me running out of cigars and took a cigarette from a friend while drinking, just one... a couple of days later, I asked a cigarette from a friend at daytime when I felt a bit stressed about work, and another one a couple of days after. I had a half package at home next to my bed for last 50 days, and I haven't smoke any, and, to my surprise, didn't feel like lighting one, until today. I just smoked one this afternoon and another one this night. I can't be sure if I can control it after this moment. I would very much appreciate an advice from fellow Champix-quitters. Should I buy a month pack of Champix, eventhough it would bring back some side effects or try to continue without it?",1

In a book about drugs, it said that nicotine is a stimulant. And symptoms from addiction to a stimulant are that one has trouble doing simple everyday basic tasks without it. I was smoking around 5 cigarettes per day, and I needed the morning one.

And I thought to myself : ""do I really need a stimulant psychotropic drug in my everyday life ?""  
Like is my life so boring, that I need a goddamn stimulant to go through it ? Are the classes I follow at university, the time I spend with my family, the time I spend with myself, not stimulating in themselves ?

And since then, I just see cigarettes as coffee (I don't drink coffee btw), and once a month, I smoke one if the opportunity is fitted to take a stimulant (for example at a party or whatever). But as the book said, after the consumption of a stimulant, I am cool with myself the following days, because they drain a lot of energy. And the days after, no need to smoke, because I am already busy being stimulated by my own life, and deep down I think I now see cigarettes for what they simply are :-)",1

One of my bad drinking habits (in addition to the drinking itself of course!) is that I would get wasted and then buy rolling tobacco, then chain smoke about 10 to 15 (sometimes more) cigarettes. And to be honest, I was getting wasted about 3-5 times a week. Needless to say, glad to have stopped (and hope to keep at it.) One nice thing I get from not drinking is a freebie in not smoking. It is not that I don't crave it some, I just don't have that same pull as when I am wasted. So I am also at about six weeks smoking free.

My question is about my lungs clearing out. From what I have read, the lungs do a great job of healing once we stop smoking. I feel like the first few weeks really cleared some stuff out. But I also still feel like the process is happening. I'm not looking for any medical advice or absolute answers, just some sense of this being normal at six weeks. I kind of assume so. It sounds like this first year will see continual changes, including the cilia healing and doing their job moving ""crap"" out of my lungs.

Well, I suppose I could just keep watching the process and see what happens. I am happy to get some better lung capacity back, not to mention all the organ functions my drinking was taking one heck of a toll on! Nice to breath a little easier for sure.",1

If my partner - who has never smoked, and thinks he can force me to quit if he just nags me about it enough times - breathes another *word* to me about cigarettes, asks me another question about how quitting is going, or criticizes me about vaping to quit/not reducing the nicotine fast enough for his comfort level, I am going to pack my shit, move in with my parents, and chain smoke with my mom until I die.

There is no way I can make him understand. I was smoking over a pack a day before I made a plan to cut back, then switch to vaping, reduce nicotine from 12mg to 0mg, and then give that up too. I am doing *so much better* than I ever thought I could - *especially* considering the fact that I DO NOT WANT TO QUIT SMOKING.

I REPEAT, I *DO NOT, WANT TO QUIT.* I am doing this for him because he'll mope if he doesn't get his fucking way.

I am having a hard enough time dealing with the cravings as it is. On top of it all I have undertreated bipolar depression and PTSD that make my life fucking hell. I also *just* quit drinking a couple months ago (oh, did I mention that this motherfucker has been sneaking alcohol behind my back?).

The times I have tripped up and had a smoke, the way he treats me is just... so fucking obnoxious. It's either ""I knew you couldn't do it, you couldn't even do it for me"" or just silence accompanied by this look of derision that just screams ""you fucking disgust me.""

Anything at all! You never know what may resonate with someone and be that thing that keeps them from going back.
I'll start. I read here, at some point early on when I was looking for encouragement and inspiration, something someone wrote to the tune of ""smoking is not going to make you feel any better. It's not going to fix your problems. It only adds to the problems."".
For whatever reason, that really clicked with me. For me, I used smoking a lot to avoid. Avoid what? Feelings. Situations. Just facing things head on. It was a massive distraction.
Just realizing that smoking wasn't helping me in any way was a big light bulb moment. It sounds obvious, but in my mind for a long time I was convinced (conned by my addiction) that it did help me cope.
So when I'd get a craving, or feel irritable, or stressed, or even just bored and think of cigarettes, I'd tell myself over and over ""It won't make anything any better. Just worse. You'll still have that to deal with, but you'll feel sickly and stinky and guilty and worried about your health too. It's a shitty idea! Try something else!"".
It saved my butt through the worst of it. 
What has helped you?
Thanks!!",8

I always told myself it was more of a habit/ritual than anything, but I‚Äôve encountered several stressors (attempted government overthrow, anyone?) that have shown themselves to be HUGE triggers. 

I‚Äôm using patches and lozenges and those are helping a lot. It‚Äôs also useful that I live alone during a pandemic. No one around me is smoking, and if I get the urge to run by the gas station for a pack, I remind myself that we‚Äôre still in stage 5 restrictions and leaving home needs to be for absolute necessities only. 

Part of me is embarrassed that I let this THING rule my life for so long, but the bigger part of me is really proud that I‚Äôve been able to do this. I‚Äôm using the Smoke Free app and really enjoying it. I also have a friend who‚Äôs quitting with me (she seems to be having a much easier time - that bitch lol). 

Any advice on long-term quitting is very welcomed. I have about 3 more weeks of patches and then those are finished, so I‚Äôm getting anxious about not having that crutch.

All the recommendations I‚Äôve seen for quitting while driving are ‚Äòplay music loud!‚Äô , ‚Äòdrink water!‚Äô, ‚Äòchew gum‚Äô (already do those things), or ‚Äòget a vape‚Äô (the whole thing is that I‚Äôm trying to save money, and I don‚Äôt have the nicotine craving so I don‚Äôt want or need a replacement like that)

When I smoke, I have  a harder time controlling my mind, I get stressed quickly, I start sweating and blushing quickly and thus worsening the social anxiety. I suppose smoking always sort made me feel like a loser too. 

&#x200B;

For a couple of years I've done breathing exercises when I get stressed. It's very simple, fast inhale, slow exhale, this lowers your heartrate. What I've noticed now, is that my body responds INSTANTLY to this exercise, in a way one could almost say that the exercise barely worked when I was smoking. I think being mindful of your breathing is one of the most practical pieces of advice for controlling anxiety.

That is until the cravings come...  I had rough cravings yesterday, but I beat them, and I feel amazing about that.",133

Because she was intubated and in COVID isolation, she never even had the chance to say goodbye to her own children. She was in her early sixties and smoked a half pack of Marlborough Lites a day. I loved her like a favorite aunt. She was the life of the party, took guff from no one, and brought a wry and wicked sense of humor to everything she did. 

In December, my uncle was diagnosed with lymphoma of the lungs. He was supposed to have a year to live, but he collapsed at home this week and died in the hospital. He was in also in his sixties and smoked like a chimney for decades. I still remember the smell of his cigarettes in the hot Florida night air. He was one of the kindest, gentlest souls I have ever known, a great cook, a former body builder, and he had the best belly laugh in the whole world. I don't know how his husband is going to go on without him.

She explained to me that my reaction was perfectly normal, and that she could not overstate what a massive shock to the nervous system quitting smoking is. We are quite literally at war with our bodies and minds at the same time. Those irrational moof swings are a result of cravings, but also the fact that our brains have been neglecting to boost our neurotransmitter levels during times of stress/sadness/chaos/confusion/any time we used a cigarette to ""level ourselves out."" Our brain is expecting the nicotine to come along and calm us after we get stressed out, so it isn't coming to help get us get back on track. When our stress levels rise, they just stay elevated for far longer than normal. That's why I stayed in the anxious loop for so long, and something as mildly irritating as burning a grilled cheese set resulted in my crying for hours. As we learn more coping skills, and calming practices, those fits of anxiety will not last as long. But they are perfectly normal. This was a huge relief for me. Now, instead of fighting my brain, I feel compassionate it towards it. I've been thinking, ""Hey, brain, I know this change is scary, and I know everything feels extra hard and stressful, but we are going to get through it. Everything you are feeling is valid, and we can do whatever we need to do to get through it, except smoke."" I did a similar practice when I quit drinking last year, and it really helped, although I did have to spend quite a few nights at home, sobbing uncontrollably and punching pillows. 

Other techniques my therapist recommended: 

Exercise: This is what helped me get through a panicked fit, when nothing else could. I just started doing sit ups and kept going until I couldn't breathe anymore. My mind was too tired to spiral out, and so I had no choice but to chill out. 

Writing: Journal all frantic thoughts, just stream of consciousness style, and as you do, give your mind permission to feel whatever it is feeling, no judgement. Don't try to make anything make sense, just get it all on paper. 

New Rituals: A cup of coffee in the morning where you get mentally ready for the day, prepare to be focused can replace the morning cigarette. A cup of relaxing tea can signal it's time to wind down at the end of the day. I find that playing Pokemon Go is a good substitute for walking and smoking. 

Do not think of this as forever, just focus on making it 21 days. After 21 days, we can reassess and see if we want to do another 21 days. 

Also, CBD has been a game-changer for me. I got a strain that has virtually no THC in it, especially for anxiety. It's definitely not a cigarette replacer, but it really takes the edge off. It is extraordinarily potent, too - just a couple of hits and I feel like I am floating on a cloud. 

If anyone else has any tips to share, especially in regards to how to stay motivated and active without getting too anxious, I'd love to hear them. I feel like I want to do things to stay busy, to stay distracted, but actually doing things that require any kind of focus is practically guaranteed to make me too anxious to last long. 

Stay strong, everybody! This sub has been so helpful for me, I appreciate all of you.",8

Since then I haven't smoked approximately 10.000 cigarettes, and saved roughly ‚Ç¨3.300 (about $4.000). Most of the time I'm really happy I did quit; I feel healthier, can save more money, don't have to worry about running low on cigarettes, don't have stains on my teeth anymore, etc. I really do feel like a non-smoker. 

But DAMN, sometime I fucking miss them, for real. Every once in a while I get this feeling, and I really can't explain it eloquently, of HAVING to smoke again. Just the thought of the smoke getting into my lungs, the exhaling, the feeling of that cigarette between my fingers, wow... 

And don't get me wrong, most of the time I find cigarettes fucking disgusting and am very happy I did quit. When I walk past a smoker, and watch them enjoy their cigarette, I feel sorry for them really. But every once in a while, when the stars align, I get this powerful feeling of needing to smoke again. I'm wondering if this powerful , yet sporadic feeling, will haunt me for the rest of my life. And if so, I'm afraid I will break and light a cigarette again.

2021-01-15 11:24:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kxxvta/addiction_is_a_bitch/,Addiction is a bitch.,"So I decided to quit smoking 2 days ago because my life quality has been shit for last few months, i'm only 22, skinny guy and I breath like a cow after walking up a few stairs. I have been struggling eating healthy because when i'm hungry i can just lit a cigarette and i dont feel like eating anymore.

Even though i'm not an extreme smoker and i have been smoking for about 4 years, I love smoking, i really do. I love the taste of it, the smell of it when it first burns, the hold of it, and the whole atmosphere of smoking a cigarette. It's hard to imagine not to smoke ever again, and i would never quit smoking if i didn't start feeling older than i really am. Remembering how fit i was few years ago and how much i worked out really bugs me, i feel just like a resting potato bag. I don't want to grow old and regret how i wasted my youth.

But the point of this post is that nicotine addiction is a bitch as the title says. Even though you know all the harm it does to your and you know all the reasons why you quit in the first place, your brain will still find very clever ideas to make you smoke, this is really creepy, some of the ideas i get and are really convincing are like ""fuck these cravings are bad, maybe i should get a vape pen."" or ""maybe i shouldnt have quit cold turkey but gradually"" and this is what makes you smoke that ""one more cigarette""

The crazy thing is that i'm still on day two. Who knows how bad it will get.

I know this post is kinda pointless but i'm really craving a cigarette right now and if i didn't write this, i could be smoking.

Good luck to everyone trying to quit, we can do it for what it's worth :)",26

I am experiencing some problems during this process. On the second day of quitting, I started to feel numb, I lost the will to live, even I couldn't get close to the knives for a while because I was thinking about cutting my wrists to get rid of that feeling. Physical side effects such as headache and dizziness do not affect me, but I am experiencing very severe psychological conditions.   


There are only games where I can keep myself busy, and it was impossible to play them with that psychology. After 5 minutes my eyes gets so watery that I can't look at the monitor. I can't focus at anything. I spent 2 days in the house wandering back and forth for hours. Sleeping is torture in itself, I had long and meaningless nightmares and woke up in awkward times etc. 

Does life consistently pass through depression and numbness after quitting smoking? It seemed as if that process would never end, I bought a new package at the end of the second day, as if the colors of life were restored. But there was a bitterness in me, the bitterness of failure.  How did you quit smoking? Was your situation severe like me?",4

I was 17 when I started smoking regulary, now Im 22. There has been a time when I had quit for 6 months but then I started smoking again. After a while I switched to vaping, did it for year and then quit.

Vaping itself felt a lot more pleasant to me. Mostly because I could do it inside and that it doesnt leave any smell. I would often feel embarassed when people saw me smoking. Vaping allowed me to be more sneaky in a way lol. I would still smoke a cig now and then but mostly I vaped. But the main problem with vaping is that you cant get enough of it. Sometimes it felt like I would spend most of my day vaping. Also I hated how my hands were always sticky from juice and also how much money I spent. And the juice would just get more and more expensive. So I just decided I could live without it. 

Im not saying that switching to vaping will help everyone quit smoking. Some of my friends came back to cigs eventualy after vaping for some time. But it did help me.

I just wanted to post a two-week update! For background, I quit vaping on New Years Eve. I vaped for 6 years, and smoked cigs for a few years before that. I was totally hooked to my vape. Like... I always had it by my side, fully charged with backup batteries and plenty of juice. It was my adult pacifier. I quit drinking in May of last year, and I knew that vaping would be the next (and probably last?) addiction on the chopping block. 

Anyway! It's amazing how normal I feel now. Everyone who said that it gets better after the first week is so right. The first few days were HELL. Abject misery. I felt like I was losing my marbles. It's crazy too, because I was on the patch! SO what I was experiencing was psychological and emotional withdrawal... with maybe some nic withdrawal in there too, since god only knows how much nicotine I was pumping through my body every day. 

I probably gained about 4 pounds during the last two weeks, too. I kind of gave myself (mostly) free reign to just eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. It got a little bit out of control, but I'm back on the wagon again with my diet. A few weeks of mindful healthy eating and exercise will get me right back to where I need to be. 

The quit vaping kit that I posted on day 2 was a HUGE success. You can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kozxut/im_on_day_2_and_i_wanted_to_share_my_stopvaping/). The most useful things in the kit ended up being the sudoku puzzles, gum, mints, and surprisingly the essential oil spray. Every time I'd get hit with cravings, I would do a sudoku puzzle and spray some of that spray on a blanket or pillow and snuggle with it. The lavender was SO relaxing. I think the sudoku helped so much because whenever I'd be hanging out at home, I'd be vaping. The sudoku puzzles gave me something to do while watching TV that kept me mildly occupied. I highly recommend it.

The chew necklaces were a total bust, by the way. I wish I hadn't bought them. They are way too hard to feasibly chew on. The konjac jelly things were excellent, but I slammed through all 20 packets in the first week. Oops! The coloring book and silly puddy were nice too, I just didn't end up using them as much for whatever reason.

Honestly, just having my little kit nearby was comforting in and of itself. 

I don't find myself thinking about vaping much at all anymore, although it does still happen from time to time. I think it probably will for a while. Hanging out without it feels much more natural to me now. I still plan on doing the full round of patches. Oh, and I also got some nicotine gum to chew on, which I use maybe once/day. I was very forgiving of myself with the physical nicotine addiction side of things, because I knew getting through the psychological part of the addiction was going to be the hardest part. And it absolutely was. I had initially considered getting 0 nicotine vape juice and kicking the physical addiction before the habitual addiction, and I'm glad I didn't go that route. I think I could have hung onto 0 nic juice forever. Kicking the habitual part is just so, so hard. 

So that's my two-week update! If anyone is lurking, thinking about quitting vaping.... do it, friend. It's so liberating, and you'll save so much money, too! I came to realize that my addiction was causing me a lot of anxiety, and I am so much better off without it. I don't have to worry about the unknown long-term health effects, or whether or not I have enough juice to last the week, or if my batteries are going to die, or if my coils will burn out.... ad infinum. Life is better now. Fucking do it, you will not regret it!",6

I'll be 3 years quit next month. Freest I've ever felt.

Now I run marathons and help people get the fuck off cigarettes (among other things)

I recorded a new podcast yesterday about why ""cutting down"" doesn't do a damn thing. Thought I'd share. Lots of swearing and sexy science from Allen Carr <3

I have finally gotten it down to about a cigarette a week and would like to push it over the edge and quit for good. I have not had any withdrawal symptoms so far (thank god) but one thing that I think would really help me get through it would be the ability to ""smoke"" something with no nicotine and absolutely minimal health risks.


There are a couple reasons this would be really helpful for me: 1: I miss the feeling of taking a puff, it just feels nice and that's what gets me itching the most. 2 I still hang put with many of my friends who smoke, and when they go out for a cig I would like to be able to join them without standing around awkwardly doing nothing. And 3, when I drink I tend to find myself smoking and I hope I would be able to do this instead.


I have looked at some possibilities including nicotine free vapes or caffeine pens, but these still have health risks. My ideal solution would be a way to vape pure water if something convenient for that existed. Any recommendations for stuff to do would really help me out!",0

I smoked a pack a day through my 20s and early to mid 30s.  I had quit dozens of times, never lasting more than week.  Once I quit for about 6 months using the patch, but when it came time to quit the patch I just went and bought a pack of cigarettes after a few days.  Then, in late 2011, after lurking here for years, I started reading Allen Carr's Easy Way on the recommendation of this sub. On the morning of January 10th, 2012 I finished the book while smoking the last cigarette I ever smoked -- the last cigarette I will ever smoke.

Sunday marked my 9 year anniversary smoke-free.  I'm telling my story because I remember, like it was yesterday, what it was like to think I could never live without cigarettes.  I remember thinking the cravings would remain for the rest of my life.  I remember the first few years after quitting, when I would routinely have dreams about smoking, and wake up in a guilty panic like I had failed.  I remember thinking, and writing in this sub, that those dreams would probably never end.  I was wrong about all of those things.

After quitting, I wanted something positive to do with my nervous energy and a way to deal with the weight I was putting on, so I found the couch to 5k sub ( /r/c25k) and started running.  A few years after that, I ran my first 10k.  In 2018, I ran my first half marathon. In 2019, I ran my first full marathon.  In 2020, I ran 4 50k ultra-marathons.  10 years ago my lungs wheezed when I breathed, and hurt when I coughed. Each time I got sick I thought ""maybe this is the time smoking caught up to me.""  This year I'll run a 50 mile race.

I'm here to tell you that if I can do this, anyone can.  I'm here to tell you that you got this.  It does get better, you get better, and the cigarettes are holding you back, they're not helping you.  I used to think that cigarettes were self-medication for my anxiety.  Once I cleared from the haze, I realized that it wasn't helping my anxiety, it was amplifying it.  You believe they help you, and you believe you can't live without them because you're a hostage, and hostages grow to love and depend on the terrorists that control them.

You want to quit, that's why you're here.  Even if you're just lurking, you wouldn't be here if you didn't want it, and that want, ultimately, is all you need to take the first step.  And when you're ready, take that step.  You got this.",265

I started vaping around 3 years ago, my friends started doing it and I got into it as well. I enjoyed the head rush, typical starting story I suppose. Anyways, I didn‚Äôt really plan for it, it was a rather impulsive decision... I decided I should quit cold turkey so I put it in my suitcase and left it there. It‚Äôs been about 10 days now. I used to vape around half a pod a day of 50mg nicotine before I suddenly stopped so I expected an intense withdrawal, but fuck. I‚Äôve been getting these really bad heart palpitations. I‚Äôll just be sitting down or walking around (not a whole lot of physical effort) and all of a sudden my heart will start pounding and my chest/upper back starts to get really tight. I have one of those pulse oximeters so I always check the thing when it happens, my heart rate goes up to ~130 bpm. I‚Äôve gone to the ER and an urgent care to get it checked out and both times they said my heart was fine, but I have no idea what these random episodes are? They didn‚Äôt start happening until I put the vape down so I‚Äôm guessing it is just the withdrawal after all, but fuck. These random episodes of a pounding heart have been driving my anxiety through the damn roof. They happen at least once a day. Once I feel my heart pounding like that, I just compulsively start to freak the hell out for a little then have to lay down and breathe for like 30 minutes, sometimes around an hour, just for it to go away. Feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of having a heart attack at some point of every damn day. Sounds dumb but makes me wonder if I just take another hit, will this go away or just make it worse? Idk. Feels like forever ago that I quit and I‚Äôm getting sick of whatever this is. Anyone else have something like this when they quit?..",2

I've seen plenty forum posts about how it's a regular occurence when you quit, but all of them claimed it would only be a few weeks.

Here are the benefits I've experienced so far.,"I noticed that a lot of the posts here are announcements and people seeking motivation - both of which are awesome - but I didn't see a lot of testimonials. I quit smoking a month ago, and if somebody is looking for that one last bit of information that will help them make the decision to quit and stay quit - I hope this helps.

Background - I'm 36, male, smoked half-a-pack a day for the past 7 years. Smoked for about 11 years in total. Moderately physically active, no chronic conditions or illnesses. 

Benefits:

* Better quality of sleep. Never had any problems falling asleep, but would often feel dizzy and groggy waking up. Not any more.
* Easier breathing. Used to run for 3k before my lungs gave out. 1 month later I'm running 7k easy and stopping because my legs can't go any more, not my lungs.
* Better sense of taste and smell. Not by much, admittedly, but noticeable.
* Less stress. I thought it would be the other way around, since I though I manage my stress by smoking. Turns out, I'm less stressed now than before.
* Improved circulation, overall. I can notice this when running, working out and doing yoga. It's also noticeable for men when partaking other cardio-intensive activities that usually require a partner. Sex. I mean sex. Sex is better. 
* I'm in a better mood. This could be because of other things I've done to improve my life, but it's heavily connected to quitting smoking.
* I'm drinking less. I haven't reduced how often I drink, but when I do see people and we have a drink, I've noticed I drink less. I don't think I've gotten drunk or even tipsy once since I stopped smoking.

That's it, at least for me. Hope this helps somebody. It's not as difficult as you think, and the rewards are so much more gratifying than you think.",81

I developed bulimia when I was fourteen. No one helped me. Dad didn‚Äôt care, mom just berated me for eating food and puking and then would pretend like it wasn‚Äôt happening. It was bad. By fifteen I was binge eating for hours and the puking, going to grocery stores every day and feeling like shit for spending my parents money, even though they never said anything and never tried to take the credit card away. It was like what was happening wasn‚Äôt real. 

I was desperate to stop myself, to get rid of the eating disorder on my own. I thought no one would help me, that everyone would just think I was a freak like my mom thought or that that side of me was somehow invisible. 

By sixteen I began to smoke, thinking it would help. It had to help, right? With how it affects appetite. 

It didn‚Äôt help. I kept smoking more and more, pleading with god that it‚Äôd be enough. Chain smoking after puking your guts out for hours is really not a pleasant experience, especially in intervals. 

Long story short, I fucked up. I‚Äôm a long way from where I was at sixteen. But I‚Äôm nothing. I‚Äôm this useless fucked up person that can‚Äôt even manage a job. I‚Äôm such a freak that my parents wouldn‚Äôt even lift a finger for years while I‚Äôd stay up until the morning eating and puking over and over again.  

I‚Äôm 24 now. Things are better, and these past four months especially were good. I completely stopped the bulimia. Didn‚Äôt want it, didn‚Äôt go into weird states where I felt possessed or emotionally pained or whatever the fuck is wrong with me. 

I quit nicotine in December and felt amazing. So much energy. I was so happy and hopeful. But I went on a family vacation this holiday. Suddenly it was like nothing changed. I relapsed with the bulimia and smoking or vaping was all I could think of. 

Now here I am, two weeks later. Smoking, eating, and puking. An endless stream. At the slightest hint of uncomfortable emotions, I collapse, need a cigarette. My throat hurts. I wake up feeling hungover even though I don‚Äôt drink. My face is puffy. I look aged. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this nor expect anyone to reply. I guess I thought maybe someone here would understand in a way. 

Peace.",4

I know it‚Äôll catch up to me and my boyfriend is still smoking but I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get to it. Thanks everybody! Keep up the good work!,8

Having a hard time right now.,"Relatively new smoker. 3 years. I was able to quit on cigarettes alone for a couple of weeks. But then I started vaping as form of ""cleaner"" smoking. With the pandemic, and all the time staying indoors, I increased my nicotine consumption to around 50mg a day. 

I tried to quit during the lockdown but it was almost impossible for me. Barely managed to reach day 3. 

Ended up getting prescribed champix. Currently on week 6. I was supposed to quit completely on week 2, but reality is my last cigarette/vape was week 4 (i reduced my consumption to a cigarette a day and vaping almost zero during week 3 and 4). 

Since week 5, no cravings. Week 6 started out well, but now towards the end of week 6, I'm getting so much cravings. 

I've been craving a cigarette for the past 3 days. I was able to keep myself busy because I had a friend over but now that they're gone, this is all I can think about. Can't concentrate, can't work, can't watch TV without thinking about a smoke. 

Why is champix not working anymore? I haven't had a cravings for 10 days that zi almost forgot the whole cravings thing.",3

I figured I would grab another pack in the morning. That night, however, I ended up getting a rough case of food poisoning. So I spent the next day and night throwing up, and not even thinking about having a smoke. Here we are now, Tuesday morning and I haven't had a smoke since Friday. I really don't want to smoke, but I wasn't really prepared to quit.

It's been helpful, I think, going through the horrible food poisoning to sort of mask any of the withdrawal symptoms I may have had. I have gotten rid of my lighters, and have no plans on leaving the house in the next couple of days, so I won't be buying any. It's been a while since I last tried to quit, so I haven't really looked up what to expect as I quit, or any tips or strategies to keep it going. 

I really want this to work. I don't want to smoke. In my mind, it has been a stress or boredom relief, but it's really just been a crutch. One that I don't need, and one that doesn't help me at all. It doesn't do what I think it does, it actually hurts me. I know that, it my mind, but that doesn't make it any easier. I have no idea what I am even saying right now. I guess I just quit, and hope to use this sub to help me keep moving in the direction I know I should be going.",16
2021-01-12 07:56:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kvr5a2/atomic_habits/,Atomic Habits,This book really helped.  Psychology is such a strong tool especially if you want to know what the grounds are for your habits.  It helped me to realize that I will always have the triggers.  The thing for me was to recognize them and use different techniques to deal with them.  I tried to quit on and off for ten years.  This is the first time I actually stuck with it.  I first switched to iqos.  It pulls like a cigarette but the tobacco combust in a different way so there isnt any smell or taste.  That made me dislike the taste of smoking and the smell.  It also has to be charged so it interrupted a couple of my cues... walking out the door to the tram station...waiting for the tram.. and made me more aware of when exactly I tend to crave cigarettes.  When I realized that I bought these tobacco less snus.  It has nicotine but I chose a low amount.  I realized I was still smoking when people who I normally smoke with would ask me to do it.  So I had a conversation with them.  I told them i was trying to quit.  I was worried about my long term health and my sleep quality.  Then I would ask them if they wanted a smoke break and instead of smoking I would take a coffee with me and use a snus.  The most important thing to get across with people you smoke with is that you arent a smoker anymore and that they respect and support your decision.  Honestly this is the first time I have gone this long without being the least bit tempted to buy cigarettes or smoke.  Read the book.  See what works for you.  Good luck.  ‚ù§,4

It's been 15 yrs since I started.. got super scared yesterday. This time is hopefully forever. Else I really need help.,"I have tried quitting for ever. Atleast once every year, the past 7 years. I hate it. 

So I turn 35 this month and been considering having baby in 2022. If I still can. Ha ha. 

I thought I will within my birthday or a week earlier. But past two weeks I have had heart palpitations and that scared me, it comes and goes. Last night it was there and it scared me what if it's something other than anxiety. Anxiety is cuz of covid and I lost my dad to heart attack last year. It sucks losing a parent. 

So I decided I need to take a break for 5 days from smoking and pot. I want to ensure and see if these palpitations go down with this. Coz the first thing they say in articles is DON'T SMOKE. 

I have a doctor's appointment in 4 days to check up on what tests I may need if any. So well here is day one of four/5 days. But I will continue forever. 

Just remembering to take one day at a time. I realise thinking that oh I can never smoke again, makes me miss it, I think just have little.. but thinking and telling myself oh just quit for 5 days so take one day at a time. I know at the five day I can push it again by one week.  It's the starting the quit at my own house that is the problem. I've not had for 3 days etc etc in the past few months. But doing that here with my husband who is smoker has never happened. The triggers are too in the face. So it's bit harder but not impossible. 

Sorry for rant. Just need to dump. 

I will take today for today till end of day. 

For triggers I can do any of these
Go get some sugar free candies
Go for walks
Do focused deep breaths
Sit ups 15 per trigger
Crunches 50 per trigger

Just focus on my work and not over think this",4

After buying the pack, I held it in my hands for about 30 minutes before finally caving and smoking one.

My primary response was serious depression, crying for no reason, listlessness, etc. I was put on Wellbutrin, cried myself to sleep for a week. It was so strange but I powered through it. I sat in the sun (sit in the sun! it helped me immensely!) I went on walks (something I never did), etc. At 23 or so I had a moment of weakness due to personal hardship and started up again. 

I‚Äôm 26 now and have smoked around a pack a day for 3 years. I‚Äôve tried a couple times to quit with no real conviction, but today I‚Äôm fucking doing it. I went on a run this morning and felt fantastic, only hindered by my breath. I‚Äôve never run before. I want to do it again and again, I felt so mentally great and energized for my day. I want to live long, marry my gf, start a family. I‚Äôm so scared of that depression again, something I only really felt at start of quit (went away after a month or so completely, never feel it while smoking). But I don‚Äôt care. My life is worth the tears I might cry, the discomfort I might feel. I‚Äôm going to do it. 

The last cigarette I ever smoked was thrown in to the ashtray 1 hour and 22 mins ago. I threw my (full!) pack of Marlboro Lights away in front of a Pep Boys I passed by. I have no cigarettes, but I am full of will. I am strong. You are strong. We are stronger than a bit of leaf and some paper and a flame. We can walk, we can talk, in the (paraphrased) words of Walt Whitman

‚ÄòHave you practiced so long as to learn to read?‚Äô

How astounding is it that you can understand what I‚Äôm writing now, for hundreds of hours of practice, what is smoking to that? It‚Äôs nothing, because we will make it nothing.

I'd had my last cigarette on May 25th because of anxiety about my health and my heart. Ever since quitting though, my anxiety had only gotten worse, to the point my anxiety became centered around my sleep so I started having sleeping problems. I'd been able to manage  the anxiety until today because I have exams starting in a couple of days so I'm more stressed out than usual. When I quit smoking I had no cravings because, as I said, it was because of anxiety. I started having them about a month ago though (psychological I know but still). Today I couldn't handle it though and smoked two cigarettes. I'm also ashamed to say I enjoyed them. It felt like I'd never quit. 

Now I feel guilty though. I don't think two cigarettes impacted my health any, but I feel like I tore down everything I'd been building toward. I won't  be done with my exams until early February so I'm afraid I'll start again to cope with the stress combined with my anxiety.",4

2021-01-10 17:47:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kup45u/my_quitting_experience/,My quitting experience,"Hi r/stopsmoking,

I successfully quit all forms of nicotine in September of this year and I wanted to share my entire experience in case someone finds it helpful. It is long, sorry.

Some background:

* Smoked cigarettes (bout half a pack to a pack a day) for about 11 years (I started young).
* Replaced cigarettes with vaping (Juul) in June 2019 which probably actually increased my nicotine consumption a bit.
* I had tried to quit a number of different times in the past without success, sometimes cold turkey and others using smoking cessation products (patches, gums, lozenges, medication).

First off, to get it out of the way, I wanted to touch on my experience with going from analog cigarettes to vaping although I know this subreddit doesn't approve of this as a smoking cessation tool. My first attempts to quit using vaping failed miserably, it just wasn't as satisfying for me and I still craved cigarettes. I can definitely see the danger of 'dual-use' and basically increasing your consumption of nicotine while still smoking cigarettes. For whatever reason, my attempt using the Juul was quite a bit different. It is possible I was just much more serious about quitting this time than previous attempts, but I also believe that the way nicotine is delivered with the Juul made it just satisfying enough to replace cigarettes for me mentally. My approach was also to completely replace a cigarette with the vape, which means I would vape in the same locations as I had previously smoked (not indoors for example) and at the same frequency as I had smoked. I wanted to psychologically replace the cigarettes with a vape. This worked for me, but I want to be clear that I am not advocating the use of the Juul or other vaping products, which will become clear later.

Now, some things I found interesting about switching to vaping.

1. I did get the 'smoker's flu' switching from cigarettes to vaping. This was alarming to me and I can only assume its due to the other toxic and addictive shit they put in cigarettes which my body had grown accustomed to.
2. Vaping is irritating to my lungs in a way that cigarettes weren't. Vaping caused some kind of inflammation in my lungs that made me feel short of breath in a way that I did not feel with cigarettes.
3. I coughed up some darker phlegm after switching to vaping, which I know is normal from having tried to quit in  the past, but I would still cough up a clear phlegm the entire time I was vaping (sometimes little specs in it). This must be caused by the vape alone.
4. Aside from the inflammation which occurred immediately after vaping, my lung function did improve pretty significantly after stopping analog cigarettes completely.

Overall, I believe vaping is better than smoking for your lungs, but is highly addictive, irritates your lungs, and we simply don't know enough about the long-term health effects.

Now, onto my experience quitting vaping. My nicotine tolerance was even higher using the vape only despite my best attempts to keep it low. It is just way too easy to consume a large amount of nicotine with those things. Anyway, this time around I was pretty sure I wanted to try out using Wellbutrin XR because I had heard amazing things about its ability to help people quit smoking. Thankfully, I was able to get a prescription and I also picked up some nicotine lozenges to deal with any sudden cravings:

1. I set a quit date and tried to be very mindful of my vaping habits leading up to that date. This is actually key. My strategy was basically to just be actively thinking about the vaping as I was doing it, the feeling of it in my lungs, etc.
2. I started taking the Wellbutrin ahead of the date, as I heard it takes some time to be effective. I forget exactly how much time but I think it was 1-2 weeks.
3. When the date arrived, I destroyed the vape and all vaping relative products and got rid of them.
4. I cut the lozenges into tiny portions. The goal here was not to start just getting my nicotine from lozenges, but to use as little nicotine as possible to stop an intense craving.

Now, I have experienced nicotine withdrawal many times, as I am sure a lot/most of you have and I can tell you that Wellbutrin somehow prevents you from going into that 'acute withdrawal' state that makes quitting so, so hard. It really is amazing. It may not work for everyone, but I would recommend it to smokers I know who are trying to quit, especially if they want to go cold turkey. I did have a few sudden cravings, during which I would just pop a little bit of a lozenge and go about my day which really helped. Eventually, I stopped having these sudden cravings altogether and threw the rest of the lozenges out. Do NOT use these things to replace the habit. I had to be very mindful of that.

Some weeks later, I was able to stop taking the Wellbutrin as well with no side effects whatsoever. I started exercising whenever I would get a craving for some dopamine and now I just exercise all the time anyway (I guess this my new addiction, which I am totally fine with).  All in all, it was amazingly easy compared to all my other attempts which I can only assume was due to the medication.

Now that it has been several months, I really do not have any more cravings. I know people say they still get cravings for a cigarette years later but I have not experienced these. I am just overjoyed that I am no longer reliant on nicotine any longer. It probably helps that I feel imbued with a hatred for all things tobacco. I feel better physically and mentally than I have in many years. I can honestly say I do not have any fear of relapsing to nicotine because I really do hate the stuff. It is much more difficult now for me to stop trying to convince my friends who still smoke to quit.

This became longer than I thought so I will conclude with this: I was once one of those people who felt like they may never be able to quit and I am now so happy to be wrong about that. One of the things that doesn't get enough attention with regard to the danger of smoking is just how damaging it is to your quality of life. It is not just about saving your life, it is about getting back your sense of well-being and being able to go for a hike without thinking the entire time about when your next does of nicotine is. When you are smoking every day, you don't even notice the gradual decline in your health, but it is happening all the time. I really hope this helps someone quit in some way or convinces someone to try again. It is worth it.",14

I am really excited to share my own experience here in this community. I have been a smoker for half of my life. I am 28 now, started smoking when I was 14 and basically grew up with them. They really felt part of who I am!! But obviously that was a lie. I managed to stop smoking for the first time about one year ago and it was quite hard but still easier than what I thought. I quit for a few months and already there I noticed something: at home (and at the time I was living with two other smokers) I did not struggle too much...I was so worried about the first cigarette after breakfast, or the one after lunch but I left those behind quite easily. The real struggle for me was in social situations...of course it was difficult at the bar, when drinking with my friends, cause usually in those situations I tend to chain-smoke. But also the idea of being around people in general, of facing social situations...that made me want to reach to my tobacco right away. Anyways...I started again after a few months. I am now on my 6th day without smoking. I am in a new situation, in a new country, alone and in lockdown and not in my best mood but...somehow this turned out to be the perfect situation to quit. It has been incredibily easy, I am still afraid to say it, but it's the truth. Now I know that in my case the biggest risks of relapse will come with social situations. I am trying to develope strategies and plans to enact when those situations come up and I'll feel that urge. It really would be helpful if you could share some of your ""if-plans"" for situations which you find or found difficult to face as a non smoker.

It was torture. By the end of the first month I felt as bad as I did the first week. Scarily depressed, feeling like it was never gonna end and that if I didn't smoke I would never feel happy again.

I have known psychological problems, the most prominent being PTSD. I've been in talk therapy for years and have made enormous improvements. My day to day life habits are solid. I have been totally sober for over 6 months. I'm financially stable, physically well. It was just this one last bad habit to get rid of---and I hit a wall. 

I did some googling and the internet told me if I didn't feel better after a few weeks I should talk to my doctor. Apparently smoking is often self medication for depression. I'd never thought of myself as someone with depression, just trauma I needed to work through. But *how bad* I was suffering seemed like proof enough that there was something chemically wrong with my brain. 

I talked to my doctor (and started smoking again in the mean time to ease my psychotic depression). She prescribed me a drug called trazodone, a combination sedative and depression medication. I waited two weeks for the medicine to gain effectiveness and then quit again. Today I am two weeks off cigarettes and have suffered approximately 1% what I suffered last time. It's like nothing. It has been so easy.

Just throwing this out there! Don't discount the possibility that you're self medicating for a psychological problem. If your mental health continues to deteriorate outside a reasonable withdrawal period I urge you to speak with your doctor.",12

- if you‚Äôre dealing with the angry craving, get angry too! Release your anger in some way, I went out and shoveled snow while listening to loud music. Eventually I exhausted myself.
- chugging water really does work. When I read that tip I thought it sounded silly, but man it really helps! Especially for those days where the craving seems to be a day long. 
- journaling! Every night for the past week I just scribbled my feelings out. I was actually able to write away a really big craving by doing this. Even if you‚Äôre not a big journal person, I really think it could help!
- most importantly, it just has to feel right to you! I‚Äôve been trying to quit for probably 5 years now. It always felt so impossible. Something is different this time, it just feels right.

I‚Äôm proud of myself but don‚Äôt feel like I can tell anyone. Nobody really knew how much I smoked, I kept it a secret because I was embarrassed and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the harassment. Some people knew I smoked on occasion, some people didn‚Äôt know at all. It actually really feels like a relief to not be keeping that secret anymore, constantly hiding my smoking. 

Anyways just wanted to celebrate with someone. If you‚Äôre thinking about quitting, you can do it. It honestly wasn‚Äôt as hard as I thought it would be. The cravings have faded but I still get hit every once in awhile. Wherever you are in your stage of quitting, I wish you the best!",13

But I got stressed and had a cigarette. I had three or four in one day, and I felt hungover the next day. It was awful. I only had one or two the next day, same feeling but less intense. 

Well, it‚Äôs been over a week since I got on cigarettes, and I‚Äôm still sick. It‚Äôs getting worse. I wake up feeling like I‚Äôve been hit by a truck. It‚Äôs not covid. I got tested a few days after just to double check since I wouldn‚Äôt expect cigs to kill me like this.

I am on the patch (stage 2) for people who smoke less that 15 per day. Today is day 3 and so far no cravings but I am feeling the full force of withdrawal symptoms, I have been extremely irritable and have been snapping and lashing out at my friends and family for no reason, I've been getting little to no sleep and I will randomly burst into tears over seemingly nothing. This is one of the worst feelings I've ever had and I went cold turkey off of a 15-20 Xanax a day habit a year and a half ago. Basically the main point of me posting this is to ask why am I still getting the symptoms of withdrawal with the patch on. I was happy on 4 smokes a day but the patch for 15 or less is only curbing the cravings nothing else. Is this normal or should I go on the stronger patch?",1

It's 4 am and I cannot sleep because I feel so bad for smoking. I've smoked for about 11 years and I've tried to quit many times,usually last thing in the evening. When I wake up, it takes anywhere from 3 minutes to a couple of hours to start smoking again,but I've had more successful attempts. One day, four days... Yet my most successful attempt was an entire month of not smoking about 3 months ago. So I know I can quit, it's just oddly hard. And that's because the worst thing about smoking is dealing with everyday stress and the fear of withdrawal.
Actually nicotine withdrawal is not such a bad experience. It's actually easy to resist once you get the hang of it. I mean, I quit alcohol and mephedrone, so I know what a shitty withdrawal feels like. But as easy as cigarette withdrawal is, I just can't seem to properly quit them.
I'm going to try to change the cigarette habit for some hard studying tomorrow and see if that gets me anywhere... Until then, I'm going to sleep.
Thank you for reading my thoughts. If you want to be extra nice, you're free to leave some words of encouragement so that you may help me not smoke tomorrow morning.
Good night and good luck to anybody who's trying to quit!",4

2021-01-09 17:10:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ku0nvf/nicotine_patch_morning_cravings/,"nicotine patch, morning cravings","Hi,

I've been smoking juul for about 2 years, and I really started wanting to quit. I used to smoke 4 juul pods a week, and I tried cold turkey few times in the past, but It heavily affected my work, feeling sleepy and not being able  to focus, so I've failed.

This time i wanted to be more strategic and got nicotine patches. I bought step 1 but cut into half so that I could get 10mg of nicotine. I started in the afternoon yesterday, and I  did not have  too much cravings, seemed like it was working and the right dose for me. I took it off before going to sleep because I heard all these nightmares people have.

But this morning, I had strong cravings, which is normal. I usually just take few hits. But since now I'm trying to quit, I put a nicotine patch (half) immediately I woke up, but for a long time I was keep craving. My cravings lasted more than an hour, and became worse as I had coffee. So I just took few hits (smh...) and the cravings disappeared. And i'm still keep having my nicotine patch on me throughout the day and I'm not feeling much cravings.

I was fine all day yesterday with 10mg, but I noticed that nicotine patch might not be helping in the morning when I usually have the strongest craving.

Does it mean that I should increase my patch dose, or is it normal to experience cravings in morning? Should i stick with 10mg since I felt okay throughout the day and have my patch for hours, and would morning cravings go away over time throughout the day? or does it mean that I have to increase my dose?

Also, should i just leave it on overnight? I would rather have it off while i'm sleeping, and have it on as soon as I wake up, if within few hours I would feel normal without much cravings if I put a nicotine patch with a right dosage. ",1

I think the cravings went away because I was too focused on the drill entering my skull than anything else.

The lethargy was pretty bad too. I didn't get out of my pyjamas, wash or brush my teeth for a week, I literally couldn't be bothered. My poor wife.

I am looking for Accountability in the form of Internet strangers to fully quit in the next two weeks, as I start a new job then, and I don't want to carry this baggage with me there. Even if nobody reads this, I'm told writing down a goal makes you more likely to do it. Below I'm going to list why I want to quit:

- New job, don't want to smell like smoke to my new bosses
- I know my roommates don't like that I smoke, even though I don't smoke in the house and I do everything I can to hide the smell from them
- Car smells of smoke, so even though it doesn't happen often, when I have a passenger, I feel deeply ashamed
- Unnecessary cost
- Want to breathe better

So my challenges with this are mainly that I'm a very anxious person, and it's a way to take the edge off. Every hour or so at work I get the need to get up - not necessarily to smoke, but I have tried just doing laps around my office and I hate it because I'm goal-oriented. I can't get it out of my head that if I'm up, I need to do something specific, and telling myself walking is both good for the heart and is not smoking doesn't seem to cut it. 

If anyone does end up reading this, what helped you to quit?",3

When I quit, the first 4 weeks were easy. I recently posted something on here about the ""3 months mark"". It isn't so easy now, and I find myself making excuses about: ""You don't have to quit forever"" or ""Wait until something difficult happen"" to find a reason to smoke. I really don't want this, and I want to never smoke again, but somewhere deep in me, I want to smoke again. I don't want to make these excuses either.

I'd tried to quit before but the failure always came during one of the several times a day that I'd pass the convenience and drug stores on my way to work and back.

Sure, I've gone out, but only a few times a week to run to a store and the temptations are far fewer.  Also, not having my usual routine is something of a help.

I find I am fine with not smoking until I'm with my bf and bestie, and we're having some beers, and my resolve dissolves after about 4 drinks. 

It's weird, it's not even as though I want the feeling or the activity so much as I miss the ritual and the social aspect of going out for a smoke. I've tried the nicorette nicotine inhaler but it hurts my throat. I'm trying to stay away from vaping for various reasons.

I've taken a month off of drinking to re-evaluate my use of that drug, however it is possible I will simply set some strict rules for myself and go back to drinking without binge drinking. I'm trying to think of a thing I can do with my buddies when they go out for a smoke e.g. eat a lil snack I enjoy or some hydrating drink I like.

I'm sitting here thinking I'm feeling pretty ok - so why is it that if I were awake and not smoking for 8 hours I would break out into sweats and severe anxiety and irratibility? It must be entirely mental and not so much physical if that's the case. 

Im not sure if today will be the day, hopefully though. 

I have a vape but it makes me cough and choke and I am afraid of using it and overdosing, and I have lozenges but the nicotine in them doesn't feel nice on my throat. At this moment I don't know if I need any kind of replacement vice. 

The best I ever did was get down to one smoke a day for a whole month. Lately during lockdown I've taken to challenging myself through fasting and dieting, wanting to actually improve my health. 

Would it be recommended that I attempt the vape or lozenges if I feel I need to? or do I really not need those either. Slamming some coffee right now, feeling pretty all right.",3

These holidays I was at home and out of boredom I smoked three packs already. Just threw the last one half empty and I really want to have a nice smoke-free 2021 but I don't believe myself anymore. I will likely go through the withdrawal not smoking for a couple of months and I will probably again without a thought go back to it.

My father is a great example to me, after 35 years of regular smoking, he just stopped out right and is now 8 years enjoying a healthy life. He's feeling so good that at his advanced age was able to recover his sexual potency and is dating women and having fun with them (even smoking women don't bother him). I, on the contrary, can't stop thinking how cool smoking is and how much I miss from life without it.

Whenever I star smoking again, I quickly remember how bad it is and why I don't want to do it. But as soon as I star feeling healthy, I quickly forget.

But my addiction to cigarettes has only gotten worse since and I got to the point where I was smoking almost a pack a day. I did quit for a few months in 2018 when I was dating this girl buf picked the habit up litteraly 5 min after we broke up and I dont rember going through bad widthdrawal then but I only smoked 4 cigarettes in a day maximum back then. 

Anyway I managed to go cigarette free for the 29th and 30th of December but picked the habit up again after a few drinks on new years eve. My last cigarette was on the night of january first (not a new years resolution just a coincidence) and I heard that the physical side effects go after 3 days but I'm nearly at a week and I still feel shit. My mental state has deteriorated and i feel angry or depressed, i haven't slept in 48hrs and I've either over or under ate when it comes to meal, I'm constantly hot or cold and having sweats. How long should this last? I saw I video where a guy felt nothing after the 3rd day where as i feel terrible. What am I doing wrong? Is it due to second hand smoke from my parents or maybe online lesson stress? I feel like I cant cope, one reason I haven't smoked is because I'm broke but I get paid tomorrow and I'm afraid I'm gonna crack tomorrow, I even ordered a new debit card so I cant widthdraw my money unless I take a 44min bus ride to a my bank with a statment in a bid to force myself not to buy cigs. I do not want to use nicotine products like patches or vapes. I've tried every trick in the book, gum, tooth brushing, mind occupation, positive thinking, negative thinking.

I haven't had a cigarette or a drink since January 3rd. Drinking is definitely a trigger so I thought taking a break would be helpful. Also, as you all know, 2020 sucked. I recognized that I had been consuming more alcohol than normal.

Yesterday was really tough. I had been looking at the news all day when I was at work. Having a drink or a smoke would have felt incredible.

Today I bought a different vape instead of cigarettes as a last try to see if the vape may have been the problem.... it was!

Aside from being worried about how difficult it will be, I‚Äôm anxious about how it will impact my morning routine and my weight.

Every morning after I wake up, I make myself a cup of coffee, step out on my balcony, and have my morning cigarette(s).  It literally is my biggest motivator for getting out of bed each morning.  I actually look forward to it when I wake up.

Also, I am super worried about weight gain.  I have lost a lot of weight in the past 2.5 years...I was 60lbs down at my lowest.  Now with Covid, working from home, barely leaving the apartment, and gyms closed, I have already gained another 10lbs back.  I am worried that when I quit, not only will I gain the few pounds that most people gain, but it will be even worse since it is difficult to exercise with Covid.  I know an obese non smoker is healthier than a thin smoker, but I still don‚Äôt want all my hard work to be reversed.

Anyway, no real question here, just needed to get it all off my chest.",6

For example: yesterday was the last of the christmas time holydays. I was the only one in my house not smoking yesterday, the others were lighting up a cig after another and there was not a single second where at least one did not have a cigarette in his mouth. But that didn't bother me A T  A L L.

I can't stop relapsing.  I keep responding to posts with all this advice and tips and research gleaned from my personal experiences quitting so many times and with so many methods. I've tried everything: hypnosis, Wellbutrin, cold turkey, tapering, vaping (terrible and do NOT recommend!), patches, gum, Allen Carr, and now Atomic Habits. The thing that keeps happening is not that I want to smoke. It's that I don't know what else TO do at times. Not like boredom ""what should I do"" but like super stressful things. I just stop caring. It's too hard. And honestly, I don't feel THAT much better when I ""beat"" a craving. The craving passes and I move on. Should I be giving more power to my cravings? Acknowledging them in my full conscious brain and taking a more active role in overcoming them? Then will I care?  I treat myself, I track money saved, and I was smoke free 9 out of the 12 months of 2020 after smoking at least half a pack a day for 25 years. I haven't picked it back up fully, so I want to make this quit stick and just STOP QUITTING. I am so tired of cigarettes running my life! At first from smoking and now from quitting ALL THE TIME. But then I have these days where I'm down in the dumps and I JUST DO NOT CARE. How do y'all make yourself give a shit about staying smoke free on those kinds of days? Maybe my goals are too vague. There are no repercussions if I do not attain them. So what can I do to STAY smoke free? 

PS - I am well aware that I am an ADDICT. I accept that I am an ADDICT. I understand nicotine addiction and the role it plays in my brain. However, I cannot change the fact my natural stores of dopamine are depleted from smoking. I exercise daily to boost endorphins and help with the natural depression that comes from quitting smoking. And I take supplements that help. I still have days of simply not caring.",5

In the past I also tried patches. 

One thing I havent tried yet is e-cigarette. Reason is that I know many people that switched to vaping and they just ended up smoking more, some even continued smoking normally plus vaping. Because you can vape pretty much everywhere I am worried I will be inhaling that thing constantly behind my desk, while watching movie or anytime pretty much. Lots of my former colleagues are like that, they told me that they dont even realize it but they would vape constantly for 2 hours while watching a movie so the question here now is, is it really better? I guess yes but theres still not enough research done on what vaping can cause.

Im thinking of creating some plan of starting with I dont know 21mg for two weeks and then dropping to 0 within a month or maybe more.

Does anyone have any recommendation, is there any app where I could create a plan like that specifically for vaping?

I know the Smoke Free app but I mean something where I could get a plan when I can inhale and for how much and to gradually keep reducing that.

Or maybe there is someone that created a plan like that for themselves and they could share?

I have smoked for 20 years, wished to stop many times but just not.. been there 100 mentally. Been dealing with severe depression for over a year by now, but with meds and therapy and monthly visits with my doc, i saw my doc today and he agreed i should be in a good enough place to quit now. I‚Äôm getting help to do it, from a pill. I dont remember the name of the meds, but i have to take a pill each day and after 7 days quit the cigs. 

So, in 7 days, i will be smoking my last cig.

I have wished to quit for years, but covid and the respiratory dangers, it made me really scared. I hope to update you all with my progress soon!",9

I put the vape down at the end of November and I'm around 8 weeks nicotine free, which is fantastic. I feel like I've achieved something great.

What I've noticed in the last week though is that my breathing has changed. It's almost as if I can't take a deep diaphragmatic breath all the time like I could before. It really worried me so I called my GP and got referred immediately to a heart health specialist (!)

They checked my blood oxygen before and after walking up some stairs, checked my heart rate and listened to my lungs.

All fine. 

They said my lungs sound absolutely normal and couldn't diagnose anything. I'm not experiencing any other symptoms so they said it's unlikely to be COVID. So I'm baffled.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? At this point I'm starting to think it's anxiety but would appreciate any input you guys have?",2

2021-01-06 01:47:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/krifq0/day_6_is_the_storm_gone/,Day 6 - Is the storm gone?,"Like many of you, one of my 2021 resolutions was to quit smoking... again...

**2 Years ago: First successful attempt:**

I quit 2 years ago for 7 months, and my strategy back then was to take 2 weeks off work and just binge-watch shows on my bed, and every-time I had a craving, I would either sleep it off or change the kind of thing I was watching and polish the stick. It worked until I made one mistake on a holiday trip overseas and fell headfirst in that shit trap again.

**Last year: Failed Attempts:**

I tried to quit a few times, but I never could go past 2 to 3 days, the craving and withdrawal were pretty intense, and my willpower was almost not existent. I found myself always throwing my pack when I quit, then bought another pack when I was psychologically torturing myself, arguing with myself, and made myself believe that buying a pack would help in the process. Then that my last cigarette was not the right one, I needed to actually get that last one... the second came right after, the third, etc...

**Medical scare:**

I've had something in my throat for over 3 months now. Unsure what it is, Dr is unsure too. Went for an ultrasound, but they found nothing and going for a gastroscopy very soon. No need to say that I have good reason to want to stop now :p 

**Fight against one**

This time, I decided to use a different strategy. If having no cigarettes on me is too hard, and buying a pack is too easy but harder to resist against it, let's try to get rid of the pack, except for ONE cigarette, and I'll only be fighting that one off. I know, I also didn't think it would work, but I had to try it :p

&#x200B;

**Day 1: My Tinder date smelt like death**

It was pretty easy, I was pretty active, I was out with a first Tinder date, Laura. She came back to mine later that evening and I could smell that she was also a smoker, but her breath smelt like death, like she had gone to the pub and smoked a 20 pack just before coming to mine. I mentioned it to her a bit later whilst things started to heat up a bit... When she left, it felt like I had just smoked a pack myself, it was that bad! To my surprise, this was actually a present given from the sky, and it really helped the next day when the cravings were getting stronger...

**Day 2: Fighting the voices in my head** 

It's 7PM, I am struggling... telling myself that ""Just one isn't a thing"", and I kept debating with myself and telling the smoker inside me that he is fake news. I  tried to analyze every thought I had... I also said to myself: ""You don't want to have Laura's breath, think about it, think about how disgusted you were..."", which really really helped! Also, this time, I found that fighting against 1 cigarette was much easier than fighting none or a full pack. As you can see, that cigarette went to war... I ended up falling asleep in the middle of a rough psychological fight between myself and that cigarette at 12.30am

**Day 3: I command you to smoke in front of me...**

I felt thankful this morning for not giving up the night before. Things started off okay, then I started to feel really bad at around 11.30AM, my entire body was wanting nicotine, my head was trying to trick me again... this said, psychologically speaking, this exercise was less intense than the previous night. This actually lasted for some time, I could not concentrate, and all I wanted was to smoke one... but again ""Just one doesn't exist""... When things calmed down, I went to see a friend who smokes and told her she could smoke in front of me so I could build some resistance. Surprisingly, I had no cravings...

**Days 4 and 5: I'm turning into boring...**

These 2 days were okay... I've had a few small cravings but nothing significant... And I'm wondering if this is finally the end of the struggle. I also thought to myself that things are getting a little boring now. I'm also spending the extra time I have to clean my place... What's happening to me?

**Day 6: What's next?**

A couple of cravings here and there, mostly because I'm going to my regular places where I've always smoked, either to wait to be served or after a meal or coffee. Signed up to the gym as I already feel healthier. What happens after Day 6? I assume next week can only be easier, right?

PS: I didn't give the silent treatment to my Tinder date, I told her, respectfully, the reasons I did not want to go further, and one of them being that her breath was horrible and helped me quit smoking.",1

&#x200B;

 I smoke between 15-25 cigs a day and quit three times in the last 7 years with NRT. Each time I got a few months in, still getting some form of nicotine every day made me feel okay with ‚Äújust one‚Äù smoke (but I think we all know it‚Äòs almost never just one). This time I‚Äôm going cold turkey because of the terrible feeling I get after smoking, the resent I have for myself for putting my family and students at risk every day, and because I honestly do not want to smoke anymore. So far I‚Äôve deep cleaned and gotten the hot garbage smell out of the interior of my car, thrown away my lighters and ash trays, and started washing my clothes and sheets. 

&#x200B;

I know cold turkey is going to be rough (hell, I‚Äôm struggling after only 6 hours) so if you have any more tips to deal with the first week/month please let me know. I haven‚Äôt gone a single day without nicotine in the last 7 years so I need all the advice and help I can get. Thank you in advance!

2021-01-05 07:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kqxhnt/3_months/,3 months!,"Yesterday was my 3rd month without cigarettes. (smoked for 13 years, two half year breaks, a pack a day at the end) I use vaping as replacement - but my vape stopped working three days ago, and I realized, I don't have withdrawals like I had with cigarettes. Even though I was using nicotine with it. I still bought a new one, because I enjoy the habit and helps me in social situation - I think I will just not use nicotine anymore.

The first week of quitting was really hard. Couldn't focus on anything, felt dizzy, and sometimes it was even hard to talk since I felt like my brains wasn't functioning properly. Now I'm back to normal, I even stopped regularly checking my quit smoke app. Sometimes I have cravings still, these moments when really want a cigarette. I resisted the cravings so far and they go away - luckily I'm working from home now and I live alone, so I would need to go through way too much effort to get cigarettes, I'm just not gonna buy cigarettes. Most of my friends don't smoke either, and the ones who do wouldn't give me one even if I asked.

With me talking about how it went, I motivated a friend of mine to try quitting. She hasn't talked about it in a while, I hope she hasn't given up trying yet. During the Christmas break, I talked a lot with my mum, who's also a long time heavy smoker and she just ordered her first vape. I am extremely proud of her, cause I don't even remember her actively trying to quit ever, and she's been smoking my whole life.

I know this isn't the same as cold turkey, but the process of it was very similar for me, and I am just proud. At this point it would be a huge disappointment and embarrassment for me to fall back into smoking. I hope this will be enough to motivate me going forward.",15

I'm asking because I'm considering quitting smoking, but in my experience smoking at parties produced some great moments for me in terms of social interaction and as someone who's usually really shy around large groups of people, but who is comfortable in smaller groups, I don't want to lose something like that. Alternatively if I do choose to quit, can I still hang out with other people while they're smoking or is the second hand smoke enough to retrigger the addiction? And what are the things I can do with my hands when other people around me are smoking?
Again I'm sorry if these questions are stupid, I'm new to this and I didn't receive any comprehensive education on addiction.",5

Currently, I have absolutely no desire to stop smoking. It helps me relax and it just sort of became a habit for me. I know if I'd keep smoking then it will have a huge impact. I've tried multiple times but every time I have failed since everyone in my country smokes, my family smokes around me, my friends smoke around me, people on the streets smoke, and it just makes me want a cigarette every time I see someone smoke! Plus, I now rely on smokes to calm me down, and it has become a routine to smoke a cig when I'm trying to relax or during work. 

  
I don't even want to stop smoking right now but I know if I don't I'll fuck up my body for the future. What should I do?",1

It‚Äôs not coughing or anything else. I‚Äôve been to the doctor and they‚Äôve checked my heart which is fine, it‚Äôs muscular, which makes me think that something in the cigarettes or vape juice I was using was causing inflammation. My theory is further given credence by the fact that for the 4 days over Christmas I was on gum, the chest pain went away. 

That brings me to my next point, my New Years and new decade resolutions, I know it‚Äôs 2021 but I wasn‚Äôt really focusing on myself last year. So this year I‚Äôve decided that I will remove nicotine from my life, if I have to use the gum to get me over the first hurdle, so be it. I‚Äôve also decided to not mix alcoholic drinks anymore. I‚Äôll have a couple beers or wines over dinner and an evening of sport or movies, but too often i used to have a bourbon or something later on, or a scotch, and for whatever reason mixing drinks messes me up, so I‚Äôm focusing on me and my health and limiting it to one type of alcohol in a session. Exercise, this for me counts under the first one, it‚Äôs all good stopping smoking for the health benefits, but I gotta get my body running clean again, so cardio and weights 3 times a week for the rest of forever haha (I had already started this last October).

I got the chance to smoke on NYE. No one would have known but my fianc√© (who occasionally still smokes, but not around me) and me. My first reaction to seeing the pack of cigarettes offered was utter disgust... It was my brand too! I wanted to throw up - which is what I always hoped I'd get to!

I smoked for about 8-9 years, quit when I was 27. It was not a planned quit. I always said I'd quit when I was 30 but I was with my Dad Labor Day weekend 2019 when he unexpectedly found out he had a lung tumor. He was a smoker for 40 years and only 60 years old when he found out. Everyone knows the risk, but we all hope that we'll be the exception. Watching my fun-loving, strong Dad find out that he was not an exception is one of my worst memories. I could see all his regrets on his face. It scared the shit out of me. We had a friend's wedding the following day and after a night of heavy drinking and smoking, I quit the following day.

The terrible hangover helped me get through my first day easy enough. I used patches mainly to cut out an bullshit excuses I might try to tell myself in order to go buy a pack. I was already getting the nicotine I ""needed"" so there could be no excuse in my mind. There were some really horrible days. Days I wanted a cigarette so badly, and I was so irritated. In times like that I would think about all the people I knew who had quit and knew they felt just like I did at one point. It would pass... It would get easier... but most of all it was doable < very motivating haha.

I've had hiccups along the way. My Dad's cancer was terminal which made for a stressful time to quit. I smoked a couple around the 2019 holidays, extremely anxious they'd be the last with him. We did lose him in February, right before the world got turned upside down with COVID. I smoked one in May on what would have been his 61st birthday and I smoked a couple on our first Father's Day without him. That was technically my very last cigarette. 

I had expressed interest in the past of smoking one every now and again at parties or a concert if I was able to, but when the chance presented itself on NYE, it really was a revolting thought. I NEVER thought I'd react that way. I loved smoking as much as the next smoker. 

So I wanted to share because the road isn't a straight one, it has some bends that backtrack you and maybe even some breakdowns. But if you truly want to be smoke free, you CAN get there even if it feels impossible! My advice is to forgive yourself of mistakes quickly and easily - don't let those mistakes turn into something bigger than they are. Smoke one? Don't let it turn into buying a pack. If it's motivating to reset your clock after a slipup, do it; but if it's not, just do what I do and call it a hiccup! There's no rulebook. Just do whatever it takes to keep yourself moving forward, you can and will succeed!",15

I know that's not very long compared to some smokers, but it's already very hard for me. I have very high anxiety and smoking was my excuse to escape various anxiety inducing situations. 

My husband and I started nicotine patches this morning. I used to smoke a half-3/4 of a pack a day, so I started with step 1 patches. 

I've had it on my arm for...maybe 30 minutes and my skin around it is red and hot. I'm feeling kind of dizzy and nauseous, also very very tired. Is this normal? It's making me anxious which is making me want a cig. 

We have no cigs around the house right now so that's reassuring that I literally can't have one even though I want one. 

Thank you for your support

Edit to add: I skipped the gum because it turned my parents into psychopaths when I was younger and I am terrified of the side effects considering I have enough mental health issues already lol. I'm using patches and chewing spearmint gum which is kind of settling my weird nausea",4

I'm on day 4 since quitting vaping. I guess here's where I'm at, and why I'm struggling. I enjoyed vaping a LOT, and it's really hard to imagine not doing it anymore. It seems so ridiculous to me... like, I had plenty of fun in my life before I started smoking and vaping, so why is that hard to imagine? It's tough to imagine a quiet night in by myself without my vape in hand. How will I ever relax and enjoy myself? It sounds so stupid, and I had similar thoughts when I quit drinking. I have even more fun now without alcohol! But my addict mind is like, well that may be true for booze, but vaping is different for some reason. lol

So someone please tell me it gets better, and this weird feeling goes away? It's almost like I'm terrified that I'll never have a good time again. So absurd.",5

2021-01-04 09:23:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kq9o1d/what_ive_learned_day_46/,What I've Learned - Day 46.,"Hey All,

Knowing many people have marked down January 1st as their quit date, I wanted to take some time to write down the good, bad, and the ugly of my personal quitting experience thus far.  Hope this  helps! 

**The Good:**  There's been so much written about the positive impacts, both from a quality of life standpoint and lifelong medical standpoint, that I would be doing a disservice by trying to mimic them. Instead, I'll focus on some specific nuisances I encountered.

1.) I identified which type of smoker I am: emotional. I never bothered to know this about myself previously but am painfully aware of this now. My smoking history was half/pack daily for 10 years but in all of that time, I never quantified that at least 50% of my cigarettes were emotional reactions. Obviously to learn this by quitting was difficult, but they say knowledge is power and I 100% agree. This specific knowledge has empowered me to avoid the normal traps. Around day 30, I had a very difficult career conversation but left feeling positive for two reasons: 1.) I knew I didn't need to smoke a cigarette to deal 2.) Knowing you are no longer addicted to something brings sheer joy.

Knowing what type of smoker you are gives yourself self-compassion and armor while quitting. 

2.)  My personal environment is much, much cleaner. The lack of ash in my car, lingering smell on my clothes, and general smell have improved dramatically. The lack of ash in my car has been my favorite change. My car was always a gross state of affairs, because I would smoke no matter the weather (water would get inside when raining), how slow the traffic was (smoke settling in dead-stop situations), and I also littered (threw cigarettes' out once completed). One tip I did develop is once you definitively decide to quit, wash every single piece of clothing you have. And be sure to use some really fresh, fragrant detergent. It reset the way I saw my clothes - seeing them as new further motivated me to quit by creating a mental wall I felt I couldn't go back on by making them smell like smoke again. 

3.)  My work product has improved. This one came as unexpected as I've always been happy with my ratings and have been known as a hard worker. The reason it is improving is because I no longer have  that voice in my head, asking me over and over again when I'm going to take a cigarette break. Historically, I'd ignore it at first until it built to a  crescendo, and at which point I'd spent 15 minutes on an internal debate alone, instead of working. I just wasn't mentally capable of balancing this impulse and focusing. Now I feel my work flow is benefiting from the lack of interruptions, and I've been able to channel that clear focus into longer, more efficient work sessions. 

4.) Better sex. I won't be gauche and list out all of the details, but let's just say my girlfriend is much happier that I don't seem like I'm about to die from wheezing each time we are together. 

There are many more benefits and fringe benefits than I can list, but I think the diversity of these specific benefits are helpful in their own right and I've enjoyed watching them grow. 

**The Bad/Ugly:** 

1.) The emotional roller coaster of quitting honest-to-god, may me feel like my best friend had died. The joy of the initial separation gave way to 15 - 20 days of sheer emotional terror. This included literally feeling like I'd lost a best friend, extremely general negative self-talk or thought processes, and irrational outbursts driven by impulsive actions. One thing I would recommend is to tell those in your personal life that you are quitting so they aren't caught off guard by unruly actions. I actually didn't do that, and regretted it by day 5 - 7 because I was off the handle, and also not communicating very well why I was off the handle. I had this weird idea that people in my personal life would organically see me quit and be pleased but it did not work out the way I intended and many innocent bystanders were  hit in the process. Def. let your support network know so you can avoid these unintended consequences, not to mention leverage some accountability. 

2.) The ole' let-your-guard-down. This happened frequently to me around days 20 - 30, and almost directly led to a major setback. I equate the situation to being in the eyewall of a hurricane. You've gone through a massive storm that may or may not have upended many aspects of your life. You are finally standing in the all-clear! But unlike a hurricane where you know the clear is temporary before the other side of the storm hits, I didn't realize I had more storm in store for me. It would be as innocent as this: my withdrawal symptoms had subsided and I would be with friends, having a nice day in general, whatever it was, it would lead me to believe that I could have 1 cigarettes' and be OK, because hey, everything is going great! That having 1 cigarette wouldn't return me to full time smoker status. Luckily, and I don't know how this happened mentally, but I would finally return to honesty with myself and realize 1 cigarette would set me back significantly. All of the withdrawals would be in vain if I had to eventually repeat them again. When I achieved this view, the 2nd half of the storm quickly hit and I encountered some more challenges and withdrawals. Don't let the joy of successfully quitting lead you back to the front of the storm or the front or your quitting line. This is so much easier said than done and I really thought this premature I successfully quit narrative was the nastiest trick of all. 

3.) The withdrawals themselves. Awful, absolutely awful, and I don't think there's enough sage wisdom in the world or online strategies to help you through them. You just have to go through them. So sit tight, embrace the negative feelings (within reason), and let the rational voice in your head remind you ""this is all temporary, this is all temporary"". And finally, let your heart weigh in to allow yourself some self-compassion. You are doing something truly wonderful, for yourself and for those that love you. A week or two of bad days where you feel like life on earth is ending as you know it (hopefully your symptoms are less intense!) on this long road called life will be worth in the end. 

So that's all for now. I know I still have challenges to overcome and lessons to be learned. I'll report back at day 100, but for now, I'm still here. You are, too, and I'm very proud of this community helping us turn the tide.",43

It was quite easy for me but you know why? Because I was at my parent's place for Christmas holidays. And even though I am 29 years old, I have never told my parents I smoke. So everytime I am at home, I don't smoke , but usually it's just a few days. I live 300 KM away from them so usually I just visit for a few days or sometimes I might be home for a week during Easter and Christmas. I always tell myself I will use that oppotunity to quit but whenever I come back , it feels like Day 1. I feel like there's two persons inside me. I was completely fine during those 2 weeks, I did have a craving here and there but it was okay, I was fine and happy, I was reading a lot, playing games, exercising a lot and every year my streak ended on new year's eve. But this year due to corona I was at home even for new year's and I just got back yesterday. I spent 4 hours on a train just thinking about smoking. I don't undersrand how is it possible that at home I am able to trick my brain so much that even if I have a craving it's just a few minutes but as soon as I left the house I couldn't stop thinking about it. I woke up today and still wanted to keep the streak going but I just felt so empty and depressed I can't concentrate for work, I can't see any meaning to life it's so horrible what cigarretes can do. I broke down and started crying, it's like I can't imagine living without it anymore even though I know it can kill me. So I went out and bought tobacco again :( it was so bad I feel like Im gonna puke now but I know I will smoke again in a few hours. Everybody says that you just need to keep going and keep yourself busy but I am incapable of that because I just lose interest in everything whenever I don't smoke so it's hard for me to ""do something"" when I just can't get myself to ""do"" it. I also keep reading stories where people relapse even after much longer time, or people saying how they can still get a craving even after years and this just makes me so depressed. I also read the Alan Carr's book and I really liked it and it changed my view a lot but I still can't get myself to the state of mind of Alan to just be happy that you got rid of this stupid thing, I have no idea how he's done it. How did you all make it? I am so jealous :(",3

I hope that you are all doing well, and that quitting smoking is not taking a toll on your personal lives.

That being said, I currently live with a roommate that smokes weed and tobacco altogether.

We were planing to quit together but apparently his willpower is not as strong as mine.

Now, I don‚Äôt blame him and I wouldn‚Äôt force him to quit since just about a month ago I was exactly in the same state that he is in right now.

The problem is that I can feel that he is not quite supportive of my decision to quit.

I would wake up everyday to the smell of Marijuana and Tobacco in the living room, and I would just spray the shit out of my room just to get rid of the smell.

He doesn‚Äôt smoke indoors but the smell gets in anyway.

My point is, seeing him being careless and mostly anxious about getting weed (he just got 50¬£ from me to buy weed cuz he was running low on money) made me realise that quitting was indeed the right decision.

Now this guy is my friend, I could feel the tension between us since we do not smoke together and talk a lot like we used to, but it is what it is.

Im even considering moving to a new place.

What would you do if he was your friend/roommate ?",3

I had to take a short road trip so I had ample time to sit and think while listening to podcasts.  While driving, out of the blue I had this sudden craving, which I‚Äôm now calling these pangs since they feel more like a ‚ÄúI should eat‚Äù rather than, wow I WANT to smoke.  

Anyways, this time instead of harping on it, I actually laughed at how silly the whole thing is.  My brain is slipping subliminal messages to itself to try to get my body to feed it something my brain knows is terrible for it.  

I decided because of this, that I don‚Äôt want to ignore the pangs, or have them lessened.  I want to experience all of it, face the worst of it, and come out on the other side.  This, I think, will help kick the constant desire for immediate gratification in favor of long term satisfaction, not just here but in other areas of life too.  

Without the challenge and reward of fighting through this, I don‚Äôt think I can be successful.

I need to write this and I wasn't sure where, so I chose to make my first post on reddit.

I have been trying to stop smoking for the last 5 years without success. The most I got was 4 days and then it is impossible to control my mind.

Controlling my mind seems to be a sub-human or even impossible task.

Practically every day for the last 3 years I've been saying that ""tomorrow"" I won't smoke and when tomorrow arrives guess what, I'm doing what I swore not to do again.

I've lost the count of how many times before bed I threw away all the cigarettes I had, sometimes 1/2/3 packs of tobacco, all down the toilet and flush, to go back to the store the next morning to buy them again.

What the fuck is wrong with me I can't control my brain at all, it seems I have two persons living inside me.

And of course it doesn't stop there, in several areas of my life I'm in the same situation, although I'm sure I have a lot of potential, I can't control my mind, or I don't know which one to choose.

Sorry for being so negative.

There are also positive things I've been able to achieve, like getting rid of many other addictions. But I'd rather not talk about it now and keep making other posts, maybe this will help me understand myself better.",7

Excited to be hanging out on this subreddit from now until further notice. 29 year old here who has been smoking since 19. Never fully quit, but had some close moments. I turn 30 this year and quite frankly, I‚Äôm so tired of this shit. I‚Äôm tired of the smell, taste, the cough, the money, the lying to myself and others, everything about it. and I‚Äôm finally ready to kick the habit. Up until the pandemic I smoked half a pack a day typically. Then in March of 2020 I drastically cut back to 4-5 strategically timed cigarettes per day: one at 1pm (middle of work break with my coffee), one at 5pm (the after work break), and others scattered throughout the night (at least 2 hours apart). For me the 1p and 5p smoke breaks are the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù to me, as I‚Äôve come to think of them almost as rituals if that makes any sense. 

For the past several days, I‚Äôve really made it clear that I‚Äôm ready to quit. It felt sudden but I‚Äôve been able to cut back to 2 cigarettes per day. I don‚Äôt have my first one until after 6p now, which I‚Äôve felt proud of.

I‚Äôm now down to the last cigarette in my pack, and I don‚Äôt intend to buy another one. So this final smoke will be my last one, and I‚Äôm so fucking ready. But also very nervous. The aforementioned rituals are the things that I‚Äôm worried the most about, and quite frankly, what I will miss the most. Does anyone have any advice for creating n√©w rituals or something to help replace this mindset?  I‚Äôd love any thoughts or advice! I‚Äôm really not interested in Juuling or vaping.

It‚Äòs my third day (surprisingly) smoke free ( it‚Äòs probably my 10th try to quit and I managed to stop smoking in spring for several months). Now my brain finds great arguments, why I should stand up, go and buy a new pack:

1) you will give up and relapse anyway, as you did before. So why do you sit and torture yourself, if you could have had a great time smoking now? The result will be the same

2) There is so little fun in life right now and you have to limit yourself in so many things... so wouldn‚Äôt be smoking a great rebel move now? You can be a badass and break the ‚Äûrule‚Äú  and you have the power to choose, and you can choose even something bad. it is a kind of freedom.
 
3) Nicotine abstinence can undermine your immune system for a while and you can get sick. And who wants to get sick in the middle of pandemic?

If someone could help me with a couple of counter-arguments to convince my brain not to buy and not to smoke, I would be extremely thankful.",5

I smoke around 10-15 a day depending on if I'm smoking rollies or straights. However, a lot of people who stop will start back up again so I'm curious as to whether those who stop ever actually stop craving cigarettes or if it's always a constant battle of trying not to give into temptation. I can't imagine not wanting a cigarette but I want to not want one.

Also, are the withdrawal symptoms bad? I already suffer with anxiety and depression so smoking acts as a reprieve so I'm worried for what it'll do to me if I stop, even though I know it's for the best. The temptation is made even worse by the fact that I can't leave my house due to covid so I have nothing outside to occupy my time because I also see smoking as a short term cure to boredom as it acts as a 10 minute interlude to break up my day.

I've downloaded an app on my phone and I'm going cold turkey but I know that artificial praise will only get me so far, plus my family smoke so I'll be constantly reminded about it every time they go for one.

My method was cold turkey and it was hell, but it worked. I think I relapsed from psychological reasons since the chemical addiction is supposed to be gone after the first couple of weeks. 

Now I want to quit again, and for good of course. I'm diminishing the dose first, in an attempt to soften up the withdrawal simptoms, because the first time was really bad. I was angry all the time, and I treated everyone like shit and was very unhappy.

Today I smoked just 2 cigarettes, which is drasticly less from what I used to smoke, which was probably above 20. And here is a little tip I wanted to share. If you are warming up to the idea of quitting, and want to reduce the dose, try smoking in a specific place instead of in your room or in front of your computer. And without distractions. So no smoking while checking your phone, no smoking while watching TV, don't listen to music, and don't drink anything while smoking. Just smoke. I noticed I don't need it as much as I thought I did while doing this. You start realizing most of the time you smoke is out of habit. It goes with coffee, tea, alcohol, music, entretainment. But if you separe it from other activities you'll tend to do it way less.

Anyways, I do intend to drop from 2 to 0 a day as soon as possible, and I'm already feeling pretty shitty even though I'm still smoking. So, any advice for dealing with abstinence?",2

Here are my journal entries from that first month. Hopefully they can help inspire anyone new to the non smoking journey. Be strong. Enjoy.

###

**Day 1**

Day 1... I‚Äôm excited yet scared... or hesitant might be a better word. Back down the road of trying to quit. I always get so consumed with quitting that I burn out mentally. It‚Äôs on my mind 24/7 when I stop. I‚Äôm hoping this app will help. I‚Äôll only get out of it what I put in so I guess I‚Äôll be doing the cheesy daily challenges and stuff. No reason to short change myself. I‚Äôm excited for change. Improvements in my health and the money saved. I want the kids to know me as a non smoker. I want to finally quit.

Edit - As I sit here going through this app, my chest is tight from heavy smoking all night (New Years)... on the final part of my exhale you can hear phlegm in my throat making an annoying sound... time to quit for sure.

**Day 2**

Holy hell am I bored... I think that‚Äôs one of the main reasons I would smoke... get bored, go outside and have a cig or two. I have no desire to watch anything, play anything, etc. Not sure how this feeling is going to pass...

**Day 3**

Today has been pretty solid so far. Woke up early to accept the dishwasher delivery and worked on some work stuff that was on my mind. Went back to bed for a bit after dishwasher arrived and felt great. Woke up and did a mix of push-ups and sit-ups. Did more work and played some games.

Went out to <best friends> tonight. Did well. Only a few triggers and cravings but nice having 2 non smokers in the group. Tonight with <neighbour> was a different story... he was smoking and <wife> had a smoke... was sooooooooo tough not to ask for a drag. Kept reminding myself why I‚Äôm quitting... chewed some gum. I got through it. Proud of myself. Mini victories right!?!!!

Was getting bored mid day and thinking about smoking. Went and bought nicotine gum. Just chilling on the couch now. Cravings aren‚Äôt bad or intense but I‚Äôm still thinking about cigarettes constantly.... every moment.

**Day 4**

Yesterday was a tough day. I didn‚Äôt smoke but the cravings to smoke were intense. It‚Äôs like I had the angel and devil on my shoulders all day trying to outweigh each other with the benefits of smoking vs not... it‚Äôs funny, aside from the act of sucking on a cig, there‚Äôs not one damn benefit to smoking. Nothing. Why I was / am so addicted is insane.

Anyways, I got through the day with my gum, checking my app and reminding myself of my quit reasons.

**Day 5**

The cravings and desire to smoke today weren‚Äôt that bad. I might of had a few moments that were more intense than others but as a whole, solid day.

I wasn‚Äôt around <neighbour> smoking today which helped a lot. Few moments of boredom that I got through by making myself busy when I recognized my mind was wandering down the ‚Äúa cig would be nice right now‚Äù path.

**Day 6**

I don‚Äôt think my desire to smoke was all that bad today. I still feel highly motivated so again, the idea of smoking is almost nill. However, the THOUGHT of smoking is always present. Make sense?!??

Today was my first day of work since quitting. It was incredible how bad <coworker> smelled when he would come in from a cig. It‚Äôs actually unreal how smokers don‚Äôt smell that.

There was 2-3 moments today at work where I would normally pull away from my desk and go for a cig. I just chewed gum and moved on if something was getting to me. I‚Äôll have to come up with ways to make sure I‚Äôm not replacing the cig cravings with food.

Healthy healthy. Not another puff, no matter what.

**Day 7**

Not a bad day at all. I love having great breath all day, I‚Äôm really watching what goes into my body and I‚Äôm proud I don‚Äôt stink, don‚Äôt need to take a break every 30-60 minutes to go smoke, etc. It‚Äôs all just feeling really good.

I think it‚Äôs evident that it‚Äôs <neighbour>, <best friend> and likely <brother> that are going to be the hardest cravings to resist. I‚Äôve always smoked with them and the social plus smoking just worked soooo good. At least <best friend> doesn‚Äôt buy cigs anymore so that‚Äôs one less worry. I‚Äôll always have to make sure I got my gum or separate myself from them if the cravings get to be too much.

All for now. Feeling gooood!

Not another puff, no matter what!

**Day 8**

NON SMOKER in da house!!!! Haha, I‚Äôm feeling so damn proud of myself and the self control I feel daily is very rewarding mentally. I‚Äôve always wanted to quit for good deep down but the instant gratification of a smoke always won. Not anymore! It‚Äôs about my long term health. I want to live a long life. I want to inspire others not to smoke and make themselves better through improvement.

Pushups still going good but my left elbow was odd today. Had to stop 2 pushups from finish. Hopefully non issue tomorrow.

Not another puff, no matter what!

Be strong self. Let‚Äôs keep kicking ass.

**Day 9**

Solid day. Not many cravings at all. Did the mission today... kept repeating the quit slogan to myself throughout the day. Feeling super motivated still.

Got home tonight and was slightly annoyed. Unsure why. Just felt like everyone was lazy. <wife> made an amazing dinner and I feel good after eating that. Maybe I was hangry?

We‚Äôre going to go for a walk shortly. Me... a walk... AND it was MY idea!

**Day 10**

Solid day. Not bad cravings. Hung out with the boys tonight and zero desire to smoke. Loving this!

**Day 11**

Another day down. I feel great. Motivation is still top notch!

**Day 12 - Copy paste from text to my father**

Good afternoon Dad! The battle is a victorious one worthy of daily celebration üòÅüëç I'm finding the motivation to improve my body is completely squashing any craving to smoke. Which is almost non existent at this point. I've had to face all of my normal triggers and they don't stand in my way!!! I was with the neighbour chatting for over an hour last night and he had 6.. SIX smokes in that time. I used to be the same. How gross and harmful. He's going to try and quit again tomorrow. He's all motivated from me. Haha. He's helping me with the morning routine. Added squats in today... MY LEGS üòÇ

<dad sent me a snippet>

And that article... it's scary that I was so focused on how my lungs always felt that I would forget smoking damaged every other part of me. I'm happy when I sleep knowing I've been improving myself. Diet will have to be last. Changing food habits is the hardest thing if you ask me. I want the smoking truly beaten and the daily workouts 3-4 months consistent and then I'll start focusing on my diet. And honestly, I think it will happen naturally before that.

**Day 13**

Proud I didn‚Äôt smoke today. It was an odd day mentally. I felt off with work and was slightly depressed I think. I didn‚Äôt turn to smoking or think about it much. I‚Äôm glad and proud I got through those feelings. It might have been a bad day but I didn‚Äôt ruin my quit and there‚Äôs always tomorrow!!!

**Day 14**

Solid day. Tired. Work was good. It‚Äôs late. Bedtime shortly.

**Day 15**

Yesterday was busy. Didn‚Äôt smoke. Didn‚Äôt really think about it. Didn‚Äôt have time too. LOL

**Day 20**

I haven‚Äôt used the app in days. I just went back and made sure the missions weren‚Äôt anything important. They‚Äôre all in line with how I feel. Keep reminding myself I‚Äôm better off. I tell everyone I know I‚Äôm a non smoker. I‚Äôm proud. So proud.

**Day 27**

I‚Äôm still a non smoker! I haven‚Äôt been opening the app much but I‚Äôm still going strong. I actually had a dream last night that I smoked. I was so letdown in my dream. Waking up to realize my streak is still alive was amazing. Staying strong!!!! I‚Äôll never ever smoke again.

**Day 34**

Bad day. Didn‚Äôt smoke. Work sucked. Wanted one.

I‚Äôm 36 and have been a pack a day smoker since I was 18... so literally half of my life. I‚Äôve tried to quit smoking about once a year for 15 of those years and I‚Äôve never made it past day 2. 

My husband and I planned about a month in advance to quit during our 2 week Xmas vacation. We figured that since we‚Äôd be trapped at home because of covid, it‚Äôd be the best time. Not having to deal with work or other people. We could make our Xmas vacation our own personal smoker‚Äôs rehab. And it has worked! We‚Äôre on day 8 and I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve gotten this far, but I‚Äôm so proud of myself/us!

But our smoker‚Äôs rehab will be ending soon. We both have to get back to our in-person jobs. And I‚Äôm terrified of the routine, smelling people smoking, and seeing people smoking. I feel like the hardest part is coming up, where we won‚Äôt be trapped in a bubble.

I‚Äôm a bit terrified and wondering if I should get a patch/gum/lozenge/spray (I‚Äôve gone cold turkey so far). Anyone have any experience of adding in nicotine after going cold turkey? Am I overthinking this and it won‚Äôt be so bad? I‚Äôve never made it this far before so I have no idea what to expect and any help would be greatly appreciated!

I quit smoking last year and have manged to go the whole of 2020 without any form of nicotine. I'll still drop a pot edible once in a while, but it can't stand burning either. I thought I would share something I think made quitting a lot easier for me.


For the last couple months of 2019 every time I had a smoke I would chant like a mantra in my head ""this tastes like shit"", ""this is giving me a migraine"", ""this is making me nauseous"", ""I want to throw up"" and other really negative stuff like that. The point was to trick my brain into making smoking a viscerally negative experience for me. Regardless of the reality of what I felt I gave myself a really negative physical narrative to focus on while I was smoking.


The idea was to consciously exploit the nocebo effect. It is essentially the same thing as the placebo effect, but a person believes themself into a negative experience or outcome instead of a positive one. I think it worked. After about while I started getting headaches and feeling a bit sick every time I took a puff. By late December of 2019 smoking had become a fairly unpleasant experience and I was able to stop completely with out patches or gum.


I was also on Wellbutrin from roughly  mid January until May, and that almost certainly helped me quit.


I cannot find any studies about conscious exploitation of either the placebo or nocebo effects in one's self, so I will not claim that this definitively works, but I think it helped me kill my motivation to keep smoking and reduced my cravings by contributing to a negative physical experience.


Hope this helps",6

- Anxiety used to kick in sometimes

- lack of motivation, brain got foggy sometimes, less hunger, no interest in working out

- weaker erections

- health related (scared of heart attacks)

- smelly

The stop smoking person and the instructions tell me to quit in week two. The lady was very insistent that I do not set a quit date until week two. However today I am starting to feel changes, like getting very focused on things and just feeling that cigarettes can wait till later, being able to smell the nastiness on my clothes etc more and just then I lit up and almost immediately the cigarette made me feel quite sick inside. Is this sick feeling from smoking normal on zyban? I've never had this indescribable queasy feeling from cigarettes except when I have been incredibly hungover. It feels very much like that. Except I am not hungover. I'm fact it feels strangely frustrating that I can't satisfy the craving because it tastes absolutely horrendous. For context I would say I smoke an average amount of cigarettes but I have been smoking for 23 years.

Also can anybody recommend a good quit smoking app for when the day finally comes that I stub out that last cig for good. I never thought is say this but I actually can't wait for it if they continue to taste this gross.",2

Needless to say I‚Äôve failed but I wanted to ask you all why you even consider quitting. 

Is it for health reasons? Is it financial? Emotional/Physical freedom?

I know many of you have read Allen Carr‚Äôs book and consider him to be the anti-smoking guru. I‚Äôve read it aswell and a lot of things he says make sense. I‚Äôve read him myself two/three times and it all sounds just so swell. 

What I still don‚Äôt get is why anyone would want to quit smoking. I was obviously dumb enough to become addicted and ‚Äúpracticed‚Äù smoking long enough to have become a full time smoker (pack a day).

It gets me through the day. It gives me 5-10 minutes of peace in the morning and a goodnight kiss before bed. I have become brainwashed. Why would I want something so readily available to not be part of my life anymore?

It was like bargaining in my mind ‚Äúok maybe just one or a few puffs‚Äù. Finally what helped me was thinking of how disappointed I would be with myself first thing in the morning. This morning I was so proud of myself that I didn‚Äôt cave and was able to have drinks with my smoker friend.
